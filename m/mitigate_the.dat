5|$|One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been {{introduced}} into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted {{the growth of the}} Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} no major flood control dams on Aliso Creek itself, there are 19drop {{structures}}, and while doing nothing to reduce the creek's rainy season surges, the drop structures were constructed to <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> catastrophic erosion {{that came with the}} creek's increased flow. Although the creek has a wide floodplain throughout most of Aliso Canyon, a major bottleneck lies {{at the south end of}} the canyon where a sharp bend in the creek is constricted between crowded development and steep cliffs.

5|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a {{revolution}} in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. Keynes' magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was published in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Effects {{are not all}} negative; for example, {{wind farms}} produce {{renewable}} energy, helping to <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can kill many birds in collisions. For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the golden eagle has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a trade-off in the siting of any wind farm.|$|E
5|$|Flooding in the Niigata area {{continued}} even {{following the}} construction Ohkouzu Channel and another channel, which was originally planned in the Edo period (1700s-1800s), {{was built on}} the western outskirts of Niigata City to further <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> risk of flooding and to help prevent saltwater intrusion into the Shinano estuary. The Sekiya Diversion Channel was originally to be funded by the Niigata Prefecture; however the 1964 Niigata earthquake resulted in the funds no longer being available so it was adopted as a national project.|$|E

We take a dynamic multicountry model of international trade, production, and investment {{to data from}} 19 countries to assess this proposition quantitatively. Using the framework developed in Eaton, Kortum, Neiman, and Romalis (2016), we revisit the puzzles in a counterfactual world without trade frictions in manufactures. Removing these trade frictions {{goes a long way}} toward resolving a number of the puzzles: The dependence of domestic investment on domestic saving falls by half or disappears entirely, <b>mitigating</b> <b>the</b> Feldstein-Horioka (1980) puzzle. Changes in nominal GDPs in U. S. dollars become less variable across countries and line up with changes in real GDPs as much as with real exchange rates, <b>mitigating</b> <b>the</b> exchange rate disconnect puzzle.

Fitch reported back that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping for at least some effect. Haynes then asked Fitch to take over control of the throttles so that Haynes could concentrate on his control column. With one throttle in each hand, Fitch was able to <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> phugoid cycle and make rough steering adjustments.|$|E
5|$|In July 1999, the Communist Party {{initiated}} {{a campaign to}} persecute Falun Gong, including {{through the use of}} extralegal imprisonment, torture and other coercive measures, and propaganda. Falun Gong communities inside and outside China have adopted a variety of approaches to resist and <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> persecution in China. These tactics range from engagement with the media, lobbying of governments and NGOs, public protests and demonstrations, and attempts to seek legal redress. As the persecution in China progressed, overseas Falun Gong efforts increasingly tied their pleas for relief to Western human rights discourse, emphasizing the implications for freedom of speech, assembly, and conscience.|$|E
5|$|Mineral {{resources}} {{near the}} top end of the canal included ironstone, which was normally extracted by scouring. This caused problems for the canal, as silt was deposited in the feeders and the top pounds. The Fox family, who were based at Neath Abbey, but who were scouring ironstone further up the valley, agreed to construct a new feeder in 1807 to <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> problem. Protests made to the Tappendens, who were scouring at Pen-rhiw and Cwm Gwrelych, were less successful. As the pounds were silting up, the company took legal action in 1811. The court found in their favour, recognising that the canal would soon be useless unless something was done.|$|E

5|$|On February 11, Neill {{left the}} Alamo, {{determined}} to recruit additional reinforcements and gather supplies. He transferred command to Travis, the highest-ranking regular army {{officer in the}} garrison. Volunteers comprised much of the garrison, and they were unwilling to accept Travis as their leader. The men instead elected Bowie, who {{had a reputation as}} a fierce fighter, as their commander. Bowie celebrated by getting very intoxicated and creating havoc in Béxar.

That total included $15.59million for relocating Alaskans from the area to be flooded, $56million for fish and wildlife facilities to <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> anticipated losses, and $39.7million for roads and bridges to access the area.

5|$|The {{major factors}} {{influencing}} diving safety are the environment, the diving {{equipment and the}} performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety.
