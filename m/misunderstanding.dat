Such <b>misunderstandings</b> in students’ minds obstruct performance of an effective concept teaching. Teachers, who are aware of such <b>misunderstandings</b> in students’ minds, can plan teaching by considering such <b>misunderstandings</b> and can design activities to help their students to construct these concepts in their mind scientifically. The present study is a literature review intended for determining common <b>misunderstandings</b> in nuclear chemistry unit. <b>Misunderstandings</b> in nuclear chemistry unit shall be displayed as a whole at the end of the study.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{new feature}} parameters for detecting <b>misunderstandings</b> in a spoken dialogue system. Although recognition errors cannot be completely avoided with current speech recognition techniques, a spoken dialogue {{system could be}} a good human-machine interface if it could automatically detect and recover from its own <b>misunderstandings</b> during natural interaction between it and a user. For this purpose, we collected user responses to system confirmations with/without the system <b>misunderstandings</b> using the wizard of OZ method so that we could analyze the differences in the characteristics of user responses following correct/incorrect confirmations. The experimental results demonstrate that the content and duration of the user responses are good feature parameters for detecting the system's <b>misunderstandings...</b>|$|R
40|$|Interactional <b>misunderstandings</b> in {{interviews}} are often glossed over in analysing narratives, so overlooking important clues about how interactants frame the interview discussion. Such <b>misunderstandings</b> will influence ongoing talk, shaping knowledge researchers produce about participants. We discuss whether interpretations of illness narratives may be enhanced if we analyse <b>misunderstandings</b> {{in conjunction with}} other contextually-available data not visible within interview transcripts. Using research interviews with people with asthma, we adopted linguistic ethnographic methods to analyse the manifestation and specific consequences of interactional tensions and <b>misunderstandings</b> between interviewer and interviewee. <b>Misunderstandings</b> can indicate inequalities in communicative expectations and discursive resources available to interactants, which may lead to participants’ talk being inappropriately identified as indicating a particular narrative. Incorporating ethnographic contextual features may make visible pertinent discourses not overtly evident with{{in interviews}}. This may help theorise interview talk, like health and illness narratives, as manifesting within cycles of discourse that will intersect differently in each interaction...|$|R
5|$|Pairs did not {{cooperate}} in feeding, {{at least not}} in a strict sense. All such reports are based on <b>misunderstanding</b> of an account by ornithologist Walter Buller of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae. According to this <b>misunderstanding,</b> which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with her long, pliant bill. Rather, the divergent bills represent an extreme example of niche differentiation, reducing intraspecific competition between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.|$|E

He ordered III.Battalion of the 749th Infantry Regiment, part of the 717th Infantry Division, to burn down Gornji Milanovac and take hostages in order to expedite the recovery of the captured German troops. Due to a <b>misunderstanding</b> by the battalion commander, the unit did not burn down the town on 6October, and released the 170hostages it had arrested. Böhme was furious, and, on 15October, he sent the same battalion back to Gornji Milanovac to carry out his original orders. This was done on 16October.|$|E

5|$|Davis led a septet at the concert; saxophonist Sonny Fortune, bassist Michael Henderson, and guitarist Pete Cosey {{were given}} space to improvise against a dense {{backdrop}} of riffs, electronic effects, cross-beats, and funk grooves from the rhythm section—drummer Al Foster, guitarist Reggie Lucas, and percussionist James Mtume. Davis controlled their rhythmic and musical direction with hand and head gestures, phrases played on his wah-wah processed trumpet, and drones from an accompanying electronic organ. The evolving {{nature of the}} performance led to the widespread <b>misunderstanding</b> {{that it had no}} compositional basis, while its dark, angry, and somber musical qualities were seen as a reflection of the musician's emotional and spiritual state at the time.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuring interactions, system actors {{may face}} up to <b>misunderstandings</b> when their local visions contain {{inconsistent}} data about a same fact. <b>Misunderstandings</b> in interaction are likely to reduce interactivity performances (deviation or deadlock) or even affect overall system behavior. In this paper, we present agent-based architecture and scenario-structuring approach {{to deal with such}} <b>misunderstandings</b> and consistency. It is based on the notion of "situation" that is an elementary building block dividing the interactions between actors into contextual scenes. This model not only supports the scenario execution, but the consistency management as well. In order to organize and control the interactions, a "situation" contextualizes system's actors' interaction and activity, and includes prevention and tolerances mechanisms to deal with the <b>misunderstandings</b> and their causes.

40|$|Instant {{messaging}} (IM) is {{an activity}} that is quite common among college students and allows students to engage in simultaneous one-to-conversations with several people. Instant messages lack paralinguistic cues such as facial expressions, intonation, and body language, often leading to IM users to misinterpret statements made in instant message conversations. The purpose of my paper is to analyze how <b>misunderstandings</b> occur and are repaired in IM conversations among college students. Data was collected using students’ saved logs of instant message conversations {{that had taken place}} using AOL Instant Messenger or similar chat clients that shared the AOL chat protocol. IM messages logs were analyzed for examples where <b>misunderstandings</b> occurred and were repaired. I concluded that the majority of IM <b>misunderstandings</b> are due to problems with word referencing or with users interpreting single words or phrases differently. Additionally, lack of paralinguistic cues plays a {{role in the development of}} <b>misunderstandings</b> in IM conversation. Future experimentation would include a larger corpus of data and a survey of how people resolve <b>misunderstandings</b> using instant messages versus in spoken conversation...|$|R
