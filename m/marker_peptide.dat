40|$|ABSTRACT: Temperature changes {{influence}} the reaction rates of all biological processes, which can pose dramatic challenges to cold-blooded organisms, and {{the capability to}} adapt to temperature fluctuations is crucial {{for the survival of}} these animals. In order to understand the roles that neuropeptides play in the temperature stress response, we employed a mass spectrometry-based approach to investigate the neuropeptide changes associated with acute temperature elevation in three neural tissues from the Jonah crab Cancer borealis. At high temperature, members from two neuropeptide families, including RFamide and RYamide, were observed to be significantly reduced in one of the neuroendocrine structures, the pericardial organ, while several orcokinin peptides were detected to be decreased in another major neuroendocrine organ, the sinus gland. These results implicate that the observed neuropeptides may be involved with temperature perturbation response via hormonal regulation. Furthermore, a temperature stress <b>marker</b> <b>peptide</b> with the primary sequence of SFRRMGGKAQ (m/z 1137. 7) was detected and de novo sequenced in the circulating fluid (hemolymph) from animals under thermal perturbation...|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} {{amino acid}} sequence of th variable (V) region of the mu heavy chain of a human IgM immunoglobulin (Cam) has been determined. The strategy for sequence determination involved sequenator analysis of the CNBr cleavage products of the succinylated carboxymethylated Fab mu fragment, and of tryptic peptides of the CNBr polypeptides and thermolytic subpeptides. The variable region of this heavy chain (VH) belongs to the VHIII subgroup; it has greater than 70 % homology with other VHIII sequences and contains the VHIII <b>marker</b> <b>peptide,</b> Phe-Thr-Ile-Ser-Arg (residues 67 - 71). As more sequences have been published, the number of subgroup-specific residues has diminished {{to the point that}} no position is absolutely subgroup specific. An analysis of the available human VH sequences in the V/C switch region showed the likelihood of a human JH segment (residues 101 - 113) analogous to the J segments in mouse light chains. The JH region is highly conserved, has striking homology to proposed mouse JH regions, and has significant homology to known mouse J lambda and J kappa segments...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{specific}} peptide {{marker for}} diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was found based on cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) {{using the following}} three steps: (1) analysis of the binding epitope of autoimmune antibodies using ϵ-aminocaproic acid-modified peptides; (2) RA diagnosis using sequence-modified peptides; and (3) evaluation of the peptides’ diagnostic performance for RA diagnosis. Ninety-five serum samples were analyzed by ELISA and compared using MedCalc (version 15. 2. 1). Microplate binding ϵ-aminocaproic acid {{was added to the}} N- or C-terminal of the CCP sequence. The N-terminal anchoring peptide assay showed 15 % higher specificity compared with the C-terminal anchoring peptide assay. Based on this result, the hydrophilic C-terminal sequence of CCP was substituted with a hydrophobic amino acid. Among the sequence-modified peptides, CCP 11 A (in which alanine was substituted for the 11 th amino acid of CCP) assay showed the highest sensitivity (87 %) and specificity (100 %) for RA diagnosis. Thus, CCP 11 A was selected as a possible specific <b>marker</b> <b>peptide</b> for RA diagnosis and further analyzed. The results of this analysis indicated that CCP 11 A showed better specificity than the CCP assay in both healthy individuals (11 % better) and OA cohort (20 % better). From these results, CCP 11 A was evaluated as a specific marker for diagnosing RA with higher diagnostic performance...|$|E

40|$|Gelatin is {{a mixture}} of polypeptides {{obtained}} by hydrolysis of collagen primarily from bovine and porcine skin and bones. The similarity between different gelatins makes it difficult to trace their species origin. In this work, a new method for differentiation between bovine and porcine gelatin was developed based on detection and identification of <b>marker</b> <b>peptides</b> in digested gelatins. Sequence alignment analysis indicates that bovine and porcine Type I collagen contain differential sequences. The gelatins were digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The <b>marker</b> <b>peptides</b> specific for bovine and porcine were successfully detected in the digested bovine and porcine gelatin, respectively. Comparative analysis indicated that more <b>marker</b> <b>peptides</b> could be detected in gelatin with a higher mean molecular weight. It was found that proline hydroxylation was a key factor affecting the peptide identification. For peptides such as GPPGSAGSPGK and GPPGSAGAPGK detected in digested bovine and porcine gelatin, respectively, the sequence should be verified manually since the mass shift caused by proline hydroxylation can be confused with the mass difference between Set and Ala residues. The results indicate that detection of <b>marker</b> <b>peptides</b> in the digested gelatin sample using HPLC-MS/MS is an effective method to differentiate between bovine and porcine gelatin.

40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) {{functions as}} an ion channel in the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells. Mutations in the gene coding for CFTR cause cystic fibrosis (CF). A major cellular disorder is insufficient apical plasma membrane localization of the protein. Its correction {{is important for}} developing CF therapeutics and treatments and requires a sensitive and precise method for quantifying apical plasma membrane CFTR. In this study, the first liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed {{for the analysis of}} CFTR tryptic peptides that were used to quantify endogenous and over-expressed CFTR protein in HT 29 and MK cells. It was implemented by first selecting a surrogate <b>marker</b> <b>peptide</b> (designated as CFTR 01, with amino acid sequence of NSILTETLHR) for analysis from a tryptic digest of purified CFTR protein. In addition, enrichment techniques via surface biotinylation and gel electrophoretic enrichment were used to reduce sample complexity and facilitate the MRM quantitation of endogenous CFTR. The enriched sample was digested in-gel from which the tryptic peptides were extracted, and a stable isotope internal standard peptide (CFTR 01 - 18 O 4) was added prior to mass spectrometric analysis. The absolute amounts of CFTR from cell samples were inferred from the relative signal intensities of the ion chromatograms generated from the MRM transitions of CFTR 01 and CFTR 01 - 18 O 4. Using this analytical strategy, endogenous and overexpressed CFTR from HT 29 and BHK cells were quantified. CFTR quantified using this method showed 30 times improvement in the sensitivity of the analysis of overexpressed apical plasma membrane CFTR over in-solution digested samples that were surface biotinylated. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{dopamine}} mesocorticoaccumbens pathway which {{originates in}} the {{ventral tegmental area}} (VTA) and projects to the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex is a circuit important in mediating the actions of psychostimulants. The function of this circuit is modulated {{by the actions of}} serotonin (5 -HT) at 5 -HT 2 A receptors (5 -HT 2 AR) localized to the VTA. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that virally-mediated overexpression of 5 -HT 2 AR in the VTA would increase cocaine-evoked locomotor activity in the absence of alterations in basal locomotor activity. A plasmid containing the gene for the 5 -HT 2 AR linked to a synthetic <b>marker</b> <b>peptide</b> (Flag) was created and the construct was packaged in an adeno-associated virus vector (rAAV- 5 -HT 2 AR-Flag). This viral vector (2 &# 181;l; 109 - 10 transducing units/ml) was unilaterally infused into the VTA of male rats, while control animals received an intra-VTA infusion of Ringer’s solution. Virus-pretreated rats exhibited normal spontaneous locomotor activity measured in a modified open-field apparatus at 7, 14, and 21 days following infusion. After an injection of cocaine (15 mg/kg, ip), both horizontal hyperactivity and rearing were significantly enhanced in virus-treated rats (p< 0. 05). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed expression of Flag and overexpression of the 5 -HT 2 AR protein. These data indicate that the vulnerability of adult male rats to hyperactivity induced by cocaine is enhanced following increased levels of expression of the 5 -HT 2 AR in the VTA and suggest that the 5 -HT 2 AR receptor in the VTA plays a role in regulation of responsiveness to cocaine...|$|E
40|$|Gliomas have {{a dismal}} prognosis, with the median {{survival}} {{of patients with}} the most common histology, glioblastoma multiforme, being only 12 – 15 months. Development of novel therapeutic agents is urgently needed. We have previously demonstrated that oncolytic measles virus strains derived from the Edmonston vaccine lineage have significant antitumor activity against gliomas [Phuong, L. K., Allen, C., Peng, K. W., Giannini, C., Greiner, S., Teneyck, C. J., Mishra, P. K., Macura, S. I., Russell, S. J., Galanis, E. C. (2003). Cancer. Res. 63, 2462 – 2469]. MV-CEA is an Edmonston vaccine lineage measles virus strain engineered to express the <b>marker</b> <b>peptide</b> carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) : CEA levels {{can serve as a}} correlate of viral gene expression. In support of a phase I clinical trial of intratumoral and resection cavity administration of MV-CEA to patients with recurrent gliomas, we assessed the neurotoxicity of MV-CEA in adult immune male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). The animals' immune status and administration schedule mimicked the trial population and proposed administration schema. Macaca mulatta represents the prototype animal species for assessment of measles neurotoxicity. The animals were stereotactically administered either vehicle (n[*]=[*] 1) or MV-CEA at 2 [*]×[*] 105 or 2 [*]×[*] 106 TCID 50 (each, n[*]=[*] 2) in the right frontal lobe in two injections on days 1 and 5. Macaques were closely monitored clinically for neurotoxicity. Body weight, temperature, complete blood count, CEA, clinical chemistries, coagulation, complement levels, immunoglobulin, measles antibody titers, viremia, and shedding (buccal swabs) were tested at multiple time points. Furthermore, cisterna magna spinal taps were performed on day 9 and 1 year after the first viral dose administration, and samples were analyzed for protein, glucose, cell differential, and presence of MV-CEA. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed between 4 and 5 months after article administration to assess for subclinical neurotoxicity. To date, 36 +[*]months from study initiation there has been no clinical or biochemical evidence of toxicity, including lack of neurological symptoms, fever, or other systemic symptoms and lack of immunosuppression. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of blood, buccal swabs, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for MV-CEA at all time points, with the exception of viral genome deletion in the blood of one asymptomatic animal at the 2 [*]×[*] 106 TCID 50 dose level on day 85. Vero cell overlays of CSF cells and supernatant were negative for viral recovery. There was no detection of CEA in serum or CSF at any time point.

This {{work is a}} continuation of our previous work dealing with the determination of collagen types I and III in tissues [1]. The tissues (rat placenta and porcine cartilage) were firstly homogenized with a pestle in a grinding mortar with liquid ni-trogen. Collagens were isolated from these tissues by cleavage with pepsin. The collagen types of interest were then pre-cipitated successively by adding sodium chloride. For quantitation purposes, the sample preparation protocol has been simplified to the one-step precipitation of collagens from a solution containing 4. 5 mol/L of sodium chloride. The frac-tions were fragmented by cyanogen bromide and digested with trypsin.

In addition, our method is applicable not only to simple glue samples but also to samples containing two animal origins. We demonstrated its application in glue certification by detecting undeclared animal species and blends or contamination of different animal origins in commercial glue products. Furthermore, we clarified that both cattle- and sheep-originated animal glues {{were used in the}} ground and size layers of The Harvest. Many studies have investigated glues present in artworks and identified their animal origins using MS [15 – 19]. However, only one glue species was determined for each sample in almost all of the investigations, except for the simultaneous detection of bovine- and fish-specific peptides in a polychromy sample [18]. Our novel method may uncover hidden facts about glue used for artworks, which will be helpful to understand the use of artist’s materials in historic objects. We could not determine the animal source of four commercial products. These were assumed to be derived from more than three animals or other unexpected animals. Species identification under these situations will be an area of future work.

30|$|Collagen-based materials, such as leather, gelatin, and glue, are {{prepared}} from various animals. However, collagen sequence information of these domestic animals is scarce in public databases, which makes species identification difficult [16, 20]. For example, only partial sequences of rabbit type I collagen (53 and 526 amino acids for α 1 (I) and α 2 (I) chains, respectively) are {{registered in the}} UniProt database as reviewed sequence data, and deer α 1 (I) and α 2 (I) chains are completely unknown. We recently established a novel approach for species identification of leather using LC–MS [21]. Using authentic leathers, we first performed MS/MS identification of type I collagen-derived peptides using currently available sequence information after trypsin digestion. Among many identified <b>peptides,</b> six tryptic <b>marker</b> <b>peptides</b> were selected with no regard for the animal species of type I collagen to give different and species-specific detection patterns between cattle, horse, pig, sheep, goat, and deer. Detection of the <b>marker</b> <b>peptides</b> by LC–MS in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode enabled simple certification of the animal source of leather. MRM analysis based on MS/MS fragmentation can highly selectively detect target analytes by using a predefined precursor ion and its fragments [22]. Of note, this database-independent methodology {{can be applied to}} various animals regardless of whether their collagen sequences are publicly available. In the present study, we applied this approach to species identification of glues from eight animals, including cattle, horse, pig, sheep, goat, deer, rabbit, and sturgeon. In contrast to leather, there is the potential for a mixture of multiple sources for glue. Thus, we further designed the method to give different detection patterns even between samples containing two species. Commercial animal glues and The Harvest painted by Camille Pissarro were analyzed using the newly established method.|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{methods are}} needed for {{detection}} of allergenic milk proteins in complex food matrixes. The feasibility of an LC/high-resolution MS method {{for the analysis of}} milk proteins in a thermally processed model food (incurred cookies) and in white wine spiked, respectively, with milk powder and caseinate is described. Detection of milk proteins was based on the identification of unique peptides in the tryptic digests of cookie/wine extracts using an RP-HPLC separation coupled to an Exactive™ nonhybrid mass spectrometer using Orbitrap technology. The extremely high mass accuracy and resolution provided by the Orbitrap analyzer allowed a fast preliminary identification of four previously proposed <b>peptide</b> <b>markers</b> of caseins using only accurate values of the m/z of their ions. No interference was observed, despite the complexity of the analyzed matrixes. Moreover, the availability of a high- energy, collisionally activated dissociation cell integrated in the mass spectrometer enabled acquisition of peptide MS/MS-like spectra through post-source fragmentation. Confirmation of <b>peptide</b> <b>marker</b> identity could then be achieved by a comparison between experimental and predicted product ions. The described method shows the great potential of Orbitrap MS as a reliable technique in the field of protein allergen detection once the <b>peptide</b> <b>markers</b> are identified...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{established}} distinctive serum peptide patterns through mass spectrometry that correlate with clinically relevant outcomes. Wider acceptance of these signatures as valid biomarkers for disease may follow sequence {{characterization of the}} components and elucidation of the mechanisms by which they are generated. Using an optimized peptide extraction and a MALDI-TOF MS–based approach, we show that a limited subset of serum peptides provides accurate class discrimination between patients with three types of solid tumors (prostate, breast, and bladder) and control individuals without cancer. Sequence analysis of these peptides reveals that they fall into several clusters, and that most are generated by exopeptidase activities that confer cancer-type-specific differences superimposed on the proteolytic events of the ex-vivo coagulation and complement degradation pathways. This small but robust set of surrogate <b>marker</b> <b>peptides</b> provides highly accurate class prediction for an external validation set of prostate cancer samples. As direct MALDI-TOF MS–based serum peptide profiling is in fact activity-based proteomics, i. e., monitoring proteome metabolomic products, it is particularly well suited for detection of cancer, as proteases are well-established components of cancer progression and invasiveness. We have developed quantitative blood protease assays to that end, using synthetic peptide substrates and non-degradable reference peptides...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAccurate, {{reliable}} and sensitive detection methods for gluten {{are required to}} support current EU regulations. The enforcement of legislative levels requires that measurement results are comparable over time and between methods. This is not a trivial task for gluten which comprises {{a large number of}} protein targets. This paper describes a strategy for defining a set of specific analytical targets for wheat gluten. A comprehensive proteomic approach was applied by fractionating wheat gluten using RP-HPLC (reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography) followed by a multi-enzymatic digestion (LysC, trypsin and chymotrypsin) with subsequent mass spectrometric analysis. This approach identified 434 peptide sequences from gluten. Peptides were grouped based on two criteria: unique to a single gluten protein sequence; contained known immunogenic and toxic sequences in the context of coeliac disease. An LC-MS/MS method based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) was developed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer for the specific detection of the target peptides. The SRM based screening approach was applied to gluten containing cereals (wheat, rye, barley and oats) and non-gluten containing flours (corn, soy and rice). A unique set of wheat gluten <b>marker</b> <b>peptides</b> were identified and are proposed as wheat specific markers. SignificanceThe measurement of gluten in processed food products in support of regulatory limits is performed routinely. Mass spectrometry is emerging as a viable alternative to ELISA based methods. Here we outline a set of <b>peptide</b> <b>markers</b> that are representative of gluten and consider the end user's needs in protecting those with coeliac disease. The approach taken has been applied to wheat but can be easily extended to include other species potentially enabling the MS quantification of different gluten containing species from the identified markers...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} urinary peptide changes and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection using urinary peptidome profiling. METHODS: The study was performed in volunteers (n = 137) who gave informed consent. Urinary peptides were enriched by magnetic beads based weak cation exchange chromatography and spectrums acquired by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). ClinProTools bioinformatics software was used for statistical analysis and the recognition of <b>peptide</b> patterns. The <b>marker</b> <b>peptides</b> were identified by LTQ Obitrap XL tandem MS. RESULTS: Approximately 50 proteins or peptides which loaded onto the magnetic beads were detected by MALDI-TOF MS. By optimizing {{the parameters of the}} model, the Genetic Algorithm model had good recognition capability (97 %) and positive predictive value (94 %). Based on the model, 2 markers with molecular masses of 6788 and 1912 Da were found that differentiated between H. pylori positive and negative volunteers. The m/z 1912 sequence was parsed as SKQFTSSTSYNRGDSTF. The peptide was identified as isoform 1 of the fibrinogen α chain precursor, whose concentration in urine was markedly higher in H. pylori infected volunteers than in H. pylori non-infected ones. CONCLUSION: The appearance of urinary fibrinogen degradation products is caused by an active H. pylori-induced process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHuman {{seminal fluid}} {{contains}} {{a number of}} tripeptide amides with similar structures to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), two {{of which have been}} identified as pGlu-Glu-Pro amide and pGlu-Phe-Pro amide. To determine whether these peptides originate in the same tissues and have the same molecular origin, TRH-immunoreactive peptides were extracted from the prostate and testis of the rabbit, purified by ion exchange chromatography and HPLC, and identified by co-chromatography with 3 H-labelled <b>marker</b> <b>peptides.</b> In addition, trypsin digestion was used to release TRH-like tripeptides from N-extended forms of these peptides. The sole TRH-like peptide in the prostate was shown to be pGlu-Glu-Pro amide; it was not accompanied by a detectable amount of pGlu-Phe-Pro amide. The prostate also appeared to contain a very small amount of N-extended forms of these peptides. In contrast to the prostate, the testis contained high concentrations of N-extended forms of pGlu-Phe-Pro amide but essentially no tripeptide. The testis also contained N-extended forms of two other neutral TRH-like peptides which were less hydrophobic than pGlu-Phe-Pro amide. Neither the prostate nor the testis contained a significant amount of TRH. The results show that in the rabbit the TRH-like peptides pGlu-Glu-Pro amide and pGlu-Phe-Pro amide occur in different tissues and appear to be formed from different precursors...|$|R
40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is a major}} cause of {{mortality}} and morbidity. Noninvasive proteome analysis could guide clinical evaluation and early/preventive treatment. Under routine clinical conditions, urine of 67 patients presenting with symptoms suspicious for CAD were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis directly coupled with mass spectrometry (CE-MS). All patients were subjected to coronary angiography and either assigned to a CAD or non-CAD group. A training set of 29 patients was used to establish CAD and non-CAD-associated proteome patterns of plasma as well as urine. Significant discriminatory power was achieved in urine but not in plasma. Therefore, urine proteomic analysis of further 38 patients was performed in a blinded study. A combination of 17 urinary polypeptides allowed separation of both groups in the test set with a sensitivity of 81 %, a specificity of 92 %, and an accuracy of 84 %. Sequencing of urinary <b>marker</b> <b>peptides</b> identified fragments of collagen alpha 1 (I and III), which we furthermore demonstrated to be expressed in atherosclerotic plaques of human aorta. In conclusion, specific CE-MS polypeptide patterns in urine were associated with significant CAD in patients with angina-typical symptoms. These promising findings need to be further evaluated in regard to reliability of a urine-based screening method with the potential of improving the diagnostic approaches for CAD...|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigates the}} use of {{ultrahigh}} resolution mass spectrometry along with fragmentation techniques such as electron capture dissociation (ECD) and collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) to study deamidation of ancient bone, by using potential deamidation markers present in bovine collagen standards. With the application of these techniques, several <b>marker</b> <b>peptides</b> present in the digested protein standard of bovine collagen were successfully assigned. The sequences of these peptides correlated well with the reported sequences for bovine collagen in the literature. FT-ICR-MS was used to monitor deamidation of collagen by following a shift of + 0. 948 Da in the spectrum, resulting in a mass difference of 19 mDa from the 13 C of the non-deamidated form and the 12 C of the deamidated form, which {{can be difficult to}} assign due to overlap with the 13 C isotopic distribution in peptides. The rate constants for the deamidation reaction were calculated, and the extent of deamidation before sample handling was determined. The methodology developed was then applied to collagen extracted from real bone samples, both modern and ancient, proving to be a useful method for monitoring asparagine deamidation before sample preparation. Differentiation of the isomers products of deamidation (aspartic and isoaspartic acid) were successfully assigned (where possible) using the diagnostic ions originated from their ECD spectra...|$|R
