The {{physical}} {{basis and}} a mathematical formulation of a softening model nicknamed Alsoft, {{accounting for the}} combined effect of recovery and recrystallization during annealing of heavily deformed aluminium alloys have been presented. The prediction power of the model is tested against experiments in terms of softening kinetics and final grain structure of selected Al-Mn-Fe-Si-model alloys with different as homogenized <b>microchemistries</b> in terms solid solution levels of Mn (potential of concurrent precipitation) and different constituent particle and dispersoid structures. It is demonstrated that good model predictions may be obtained for alloys and conditions which are not or too a limited extent influenced by particle drag effects and concurrent precipitation while conditions strongly affected by these effects are increasingly difficult to model and in the most extreme cases impossible with reasonable input model parameters...|$|R
40|$|This {{review paper}} {{examines}} mechanisms controlling IGSCC in selected LWR components. Emphasis {{is placed on}} identifying material microstructures and <b>microchemistries</b> which promote susceptibility to premature failure. Two important examples are evaluated in some detail: stainless steel pipe cracking and primary-side SCC of alloy 600 steam generator tubing. In each case, grain boundary segregation and precipitation phenomena in these materials are reviewed and assessed relative to the mechanisms of IGSCC. This paper summarizes materials presented at the 1993 International Summer School on the Fundamentals of Radiation Damage held at the University of Illinois. A more comprehensive overview of SCC mechanisms and LWR examples was provided at the school, but will not be included in this article. Microstructural and microchemical aspects controlling IGSCC described here serve as a lead-in to the following paper focussing on how irradiation influences SCC resistance of reactor core components...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of a damage-resistant alloy based on Hf solute additions to a low-carbon 316 SS is {{the highlight of the}} Phase II research. This damage resistance is supported by characterization of radiation-induced microstructures and <b>microchemistries</b> along with measurements of environmental cracking. The addition of Hf to a low-carbon 316 SS reduced the detrimental impact of radiation by changing the distribution of Hf. Pt additions reduced the impact of radiation on grain boundary segregation but did not alter its effect on microstructural damage development or cracking. Because cracking susceptibility is associated with several material characteristics, separate effect experiments exploring strength effects using non-irradiated stainless steels were conducted. These crack growth tests suggest that irradiation strength by itself can promote environmental cracking. The second concept for developing damage resistant alloys is the use of metastable precipitates to stabilize the microstructure during irradiation. Three alloys have been tailored for evaluation of precipitate stability influences on damage evolution. The first alloy is a Ni-base alloy (alloy 718) that has been characterized at low neutron irradiation doses but has not been characterized at high irradiation doses. The other two alloys are Fe-base alloys (PH 17 - 7 and PH 17 - 4) that have similar precipitate structures as alloy 718 but is more practical in nuclear structures because of the lower Ni content and hence lesser transmutation to He...|$|R

40|$|OAK-B 135 This ID {{belongs to}} an IWO {{and is being}} {{released}} out of the system. The Program manager Rebecca Richardson has confirmed that all reports have been received. The objective of the proposed research is to develop the scientific basis for {{a new class of}} radiation-resistant materials. Two approaches will be evaluated to develop damage resistant materials far superior to current stainless steels: (1) lattice perturbation to catalyze defect recombination within the early stages of cascade formation and defect migration and (2) controlled manipulation of the aggregate defect ensemble through the deliberate introduction of dynamic metastable microstructures. The intrinsic ability of the host matrix to resist displacement damage survival will be optimized in first concept. This approach (Task 1) explores baseline atomic displacement and recovery processes as affected by major and minor alloy constituents selected for the dual purpose of environmental cracking resistance as well as interactions with point defects. Inert oversized solutes known to improve corrosion behavior will be used to create vacancy/interstitial traps and promote defect recombination. Dynamic metastable microstructures tailored to resist damage accumulation will be investigated and optimized in the second concept (Task 2). Unique intermetallic second phases with inherent instabilities under irradiation will be used to create a dynamic microstructure resistant to radiation hardening, swelling and embrittlement. A key aspect of designing this dynamic microstructure will be to ensure the complex, radiation-induced changes do not promote environmental cracking. The underlying radiation materials science for these two approaches is being explored using charged particle irradiations. Radiation damage resistance will be established by isolating the effect of each approach on defect microstructure, grain boundary <b>microchemistries</b> and matrix hardening. The dose dependence of these radiation-induced material changes will be used to identify promising alloys and initial microstructure that effectively delay or eliminate detrimental microstructural and microchemical evolution. Environmental cracking response is being established on non-irradiated alloys with thermomechanical treatments to simulate radiation microstructures and by tests on proton-irradiated specimens. The ultimate goal for these alloys will be resistance to environmental cracking, swelling and embrittlement during the high radiation exposures (> 150 dpa) planned for advanced reactors...|$|R

5000|$|In 1974, when {{starting}} {{the development of}} thin film electroluminescent displays (TFEL) at Instrumentarium Oy in Finland, Tuomo Suntola devised ALD as an advanced thin film technology. [...] Suntola named it atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) based {{on the meaning of}} “epitaxy” in Greek language (epitaxy = on arrangement). The first experiments were made with elemental Zn and S to grow ZnS. ALE as a means for growth of thin films was internationally patented in more than 20 countries. A breakthrough occurred, when Suntola and co-workers switched from high vacuum reactors to inert gas reactors which enabled the use of compound reactants like metal chlorides, hydrogen sulphide and water vapor for performing the ALE process. The technology was first time disclosed in 1980 SID conference. The TFEL display prototype presented consisted of a ZnS layer between two aluminum oxide dielectric layers, all made in an ALE process using ZnCl2 + H2S and AlCl3 + H2O as the reactants. The first large-scale proof-of-concept of ALE-EL displays were the flight information boards installed in the Helsinki-Vantaa airport in 1983. TFEL flat panel display production started in the mid-1980s by Lohja Oy in the Olarinluoma factory. Academic research on ALE started in Tampere University of Technology (where Suntola gave lectures on electron physics) in 1970s, and in 1980s at Helsinki University of Technology. TFEL display manufacturing remained until the 1990s the only industrial application of ALE. In 1987, Suntola started the development of the ALE technology for new applications like photovoltaic devices and heterogeneous catalysts in <b>Microchemistry</b> Ltd., established for that purpose by the Finnish national oil company Neste Oy. In the 1990s, ALE development in <b>Microchemistry</b> was directed to semiconductor applications and ALE reactors suitable for silicon wafer processing. In 1999, <b>Microchemistry</b> Ltd. and the ALD technology were sold to the Dutch ASM International, a major supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and <b>Microchemistry</b> Ltd. became ASM <b>Microchemistry</b> Oy as ASM’s Finnish daughter company. <b>Microchemistry</b> Ltd/ASM <b>Microchemistry</b> Ltd was the only manufacturer of commercial ALD-reactors in the 1990s. In the early 2000s, the expertise on ALD reactors in Finland triggered two new manufacturers, Beneq Oy and Picosun Oy, the latter started by Sven Lindfors, Suntola’s close coworker since 1975. The number of reactor manufacturers increased rapidly and semiconductor applications became the industrial breakthrough of the ALD technology, as ALD became an enabling technology for the continuation of Moore's law. In 2004, Tuomo Suntola received the European SEMI award {{for the development of the}} ALD technology for semiconductor applications.|$|E

50|$|The {{otoliths}} {{begin to}} form {{shortly after the}} fish hatches. Otoliths are composed of a crystalline calcium carbonate structure, {{in the form of}} aragonite, on a protein matrix. Calcium carbonate is diffused through the endolymph cell membrane and the aragonite layers are permanently deposited in discrete increments. These increments are permanently stored in layers and their composition is not altered over time. Along with calcium carbonate, other chemicals are deposited in trace amounts. The most common trace elements found in otoliths are the alkaline earth metals Strontium (Sr), Barium (Ba), and Magnesium (Mg) because they are in the alkaline earth metal group like Calcium and therefore have the same bonding affinity. This allows these alkaline earth metals to substitute in for calcium in the aragonite without affecting the crystalline structure. Other elements and stable isotopes can be deposited in lower concentrations within the aragonite structure and in the protein matrix. The uptake of chemicals into the otolith is multi-stage and complex, but the chemical composition of the discrete layers are proportional to that of the ambient water in which the fish is inhabiting at the time of deposition. These discrete layers create a temporal record of the water in which the fish has inhabited. There are 3 pairs of otoliths in bony fish, but only the largest, known as the saggita, is commonly used for microchemical analysis. The core of the otolith corresponds to the earliest larval period of the fish’s life. Thus the <b>microchemistry</b> of the core of the otolith {{can be used as a}} means of inferring natal origin of fish.|$|E

40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} for evaluating the effect of thermal aging on the repassivation potential of austenitic alloys.
