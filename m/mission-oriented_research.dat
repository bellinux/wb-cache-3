The {{stagnation}} in {{the growth}} of traditional <b>mission-oriented</b> government <b>research</b> centers in Europe, together with privatization trends and the decreasing weight of government sector expenditures in R&D statistics, might lead to the view that public sector research is shrinking in many European countries. In this paper, we claim that, on the contrary, public sector-driven research in Europe is expanding in size and relevance. To understand this apparent paradox, we argue that it is essential to analyze the dynamics of creation and adaptation of research centers. We illustrate our case with empirical information about three types of research centers: technology centers, joint university centers, and newly-created centers. Both by adaptation strategies to evolving policy models, or by original design, these three organizational types have progressively occupied a middle place in the organizational field of research, with blurred boundaries in terms of public-private ownership, funding sources, and relative output orientation to local markets or to excellence in global science competition. Despite the increasing commonalities in functions, we do not find evidence to support claims of organizational convergence...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel way to {{understand}} evaluation of challenge-oriented research. We argue that challenge-oriented research requires specific modes of governance and research evaluation. Challenge-oriented research goes beyond conventional thematic or <b>mission-oriented</b> <b>research</b> programming. It concerns broader transformations in society, for instance the transitions towards sustainable energy systems or sustainable agriculture. It necessarily involves {{a broad range of}} stakeholders who may have different views on what the problem is and how it should be approached. Challenge-oriented research is part of a complex, non-linear, long-term, open-ended and contested transformation journey. This should be reflected in the governance and evaluation of this mode of research. We argue that ‘joint’ and ‘in itinere’ evaluation is crucial to learn how and what research contributes to broader, systemic transformations in society. It is also a necessary ingredient in building trust between various research funders, multiple research performers, users and other stakeholders that research helps society to move forward a step in the (open-ended) transformation journey. For this type of research, traditional ways of research evaluation do not suffice. New evaluation methods and practices have been developed over the last years. But so far, the experience with these methods for the evaluation of challenge-oriented research is limited. We argue that understanding evaluation as a joint governance process is key.

40|$|This {{viewgraph}} presentation {{discusses the}} status and goals for the NASA OBPR Physical Science Research Program. The following text was used to summarize the presentation. The OBPR Physical Sciences Research program has been comprehensively reviewed and endorsed by National Research Council. The value and need for the research have been re-affirmed. The research program has been prioritized and resource re-allocations {{have been carried out}} through an OBPR-wide process. An increasing emphasis on strategic, <b>mission-oriented</b> <b>research</b> is planned. The program will strive to maintain a balance between strategic and fundamental research. A feasible ISS flight research program fitting within the budgetary and ISS resource envelopes has been formulated for the near term (2003 - 2007). The current ISS research program will be significantly strengthened starting 2005 by using discipline dedicated research facility racks. A research re-planning effort has been initiated and will include active participation from the research community in the next few months. The research re-planning effort will poise PSR to increase ISS research utilization for a potential enhancement beyond ISS IP Core Complete. The Physical Sciences research program readily integrates the cross-disciplinary requirements of the NASA and OBPR strategic objectives. Each fundamental research thrust will develop a roadmap through technical workshops and Discipline Working Groups (DWGs). Most fundamental research thrusts will involve cross-disciplinary efforts. A Technology Roadmap will guide the Strategic Research for Exploration thrust. The Research Plan will integrate and coordinate fundamental Research Thrusts Roadmaps with the Technology Roadmap. The Technology Roadmap will be developed in coordination with other OBPR programs as well as other Enterprise (R,S,M,N). International Partners will contribute to the roadmaps and through research coordination. The research plan will be vetted with the discipline working groups, the BPRAC subcommittees, and with the BPRAC. Recommendations from NRC past and current committees will be implemented whenever appropriate. Proposed theme element content will be "missionized" around planned content and potential new projects (facilities, modules, initiatives) on approximately a five-year horizon, with the approval of PSRD management. Center/science working group teams will develop descriptions of "mission" objectives, value, and requirements. Purpose is to create a competitive environment for concept development and to stimulate community ownership/advocacy. Proposed theme elements reviewed and approved by PSRD management. Strawman roadmaps for themes developed. Program budget and technology requirements verified. Theme elements are prioritized with the input of advisory groups. Integration into program themes (questions) and required technology investments are defined by science and technology roadmaps. Review and assessment by OBPR management...|$|E

Science {{policy is}} {{shifting}} towards an increasing emphasis in societal problems or grand challenges. Previous experiences of <b>mission-oriented</b> <b>research,</b> such as Nixon's war on cancer, suggest that while such mission-oriented emphases {{are useful in}} legitimising research, {{the extent to which}} mission-oriented policy succeeds in shifting research funding priorities and research practices towards the missions it claims to pursue is controversial (Sarewitz, 1996). The controversies are due to both the ambiguity in framing of the societal problems and their socio-technical solutions, as well as the uncertainty about the research options that can deliver those solutions (Stirling and Scoones, 2009; Wallace and Rafols, 2014). Tackling complex global problems or grand challenges – such as climate change, food security, poverty reduction, the risk of global pandemics – requires not only to increase R&D expenditure, but also to exploration and eventually to coordinate of a variety of stakeholders with different areas of expertise, pursuing diverse research avenues and often with contrasting world views. Typically these challenges benefit from the understanding of the physical and biological phenomena underlying the problem (e. g. the virus and its genes), but also demand an understanding of the environmental and social contexts in which they occur, and the policy networks and instruments available in those contexts (Ely, Van Zwanenberg, & Stirling, 2014). In this context, public debate is seen as necessary on democratic grounds, given that both problem framing and priority setting are value-ladden and politically charged (Stirling, 2014). This debate can be enriched by an understanding of the plurality in societal demand for a given mission such as fighting obesity and the various research options that may contribute tackle it (Sarewitz and Pielke, 2007). In this article, we present quantitative tools based on semantic analysis of scientific and policy documents that aim to facilitate understanding and foster debate about science supply, societal demand and {{the relationship between the two}} for two case studies: rice and obesity research. Most conventional bibliometric studies have focused on the mapping of knowledge production side in terms of mapping research areas and measuring scientific influence, in a way that implicitly assumed an "internalist" view of science (see Rotolo et al., 2014, for a different view). In contrast, mission-orientation and grand challenges demand to investigate the articulation of societal needs. We present an exploratory investigation of rice research (a major staple crop) and the grand challenge of obesity (an emerging health problem with enormous social costs). We illustrate a potential approach, showing how scientific publication can be used to describe existing science supply by using semantic networks and clusters based on publications' abstract. In the case of rice, the diverse focus of research is analysed for various countries and related to different societal demands and contexts [...] e. g. rice exports in Thailand and crop yields in Indian. In the case of obesity, we also use question records in the French and EU parliaments as an instance of social demand and we compare between the publication maps with parliamentary maps to explore (mis) alignments between societal concerns and scientific outputs. In summary the paper contributes to the discussion on the role of societal demand in science by illuminating existing research priorities for a given topic, and contrasting them with socio-economic drivers and discourse on needs for that issue.
