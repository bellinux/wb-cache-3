40|$|<b>Micropitting</b> {{damage is}} one of the failure modes {{commonly}} observed in gears leading to destructive failures, which in turn results in unplanned shutdown and expensive replacement, such as those observed in wind turbine gearboxes. This study investigates gear <b>micropitting</b> initiation and propagation when subjected to varying torque loads under a constant rotational speed. The study employs both experimental gear testing and analytical evaluation based on the ISO Technical Report of Gear <b>Micropitting,</b> ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2010 and the recently revised ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2014. Initiation and propagation of <b>micropitting</b> are assessed in testing by quantifying the development of micropits and their progressive rate after specific numbers of running cycles at step-up torque levels. The analytical study is conducted to validate the prediction of <b>micropitting</b> using the ISO/TR recommended procedures by comparing the results with the occurrence of micropits in the tested gears. The gear test results show that <b>micropitting</b> initiates at the pinion dedendum but escalates at the addendum, because of the greater severity of progressive <b>micropitting</b> at the dedendum of the mating wheel where the tip relief area first comes into mesh. The analytical results, based on varying surface roughness measurements obtained from the tested gears, confirm that the maximum contact stresses and minimum specific lubricant film thicknesses occur in these regions. The specific lubricant film thickness varies considerably because of changes of surface roughness after gears are subjected to various running cycles under varying torque levels. It has found that the excessive loading, gear tooth micro-geometry, surface roughness and lubricant film thickness are the main factors affecting <b>micropitting...</b>|$|E

The ability of astrocytes to communicate with surrounding cells through gap-junctional coupling or signaling via the release of transmitters makes characterization of these cells difficult in vitro and even more so in vivo. To simplify the complexity of common in vitro systems, introduced by intercellular communication between astrocytes, we developed a novel cell culturing method, in which purified rat visual cortical astrocytes were grown in spatially defined cell-adhesion wells which we termed <b>micropits.</b> We showed that astrocytes cultured in <b>micropit</b> regions were viable and exhibited similar characteristics of Ca 2 + dynamics and astrocytic marker expression to those of cells cultured in non-micropit regions. Examination of intracellular Ca 2 + oscillations in solitary astrocytes cultured in <b>micropits</b> revealed less variable oscillations than those of non-micropit grouped astrocytes, which were in contact with their neighbors. Solitary cells in <b>micropit</b> regions can undergo ATP-mediated astrocyte-microglia signaling, demonstrating that this culturing method can also be used to investigate glial-glial interactions in a spatially well-defined microenvironment...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{studies the}} {{occurrence}} of <b>micropitting</b> damage in gear teeth contacts. An existing general <b>micropitting</b> model, which accounts for mixed lubrication conditions, stress history, and fatigue damage accumulation, is adapted here to deal with transient contact conditions that exist during meshing of gear teeth. The model considers the concurrent effects of surface fatigue and mild wear {{on the evolution of}} tooth surface roughness and therefore captures the complexities of damage accumulation on tooth flanks in a more realistic manner than hitherto possible. Applicability of the model to gear contact conditions is first confirmed by comparing its predictions to relevant experiments carried out on a triple-disc contact fatigue rig. Application of the model to a pair of meshing spur gears shows that under low specific oil film thickness conditions, the continuous competition between surface fatigue and mild wear determines the overall level as well as the distribution of <b>micropitting</b> damage along the tooth flanks. The outcome of this competition in terms of the final damage level is dependent on contact sliding speed, pressure and specific film thickness. In general, with no surface wear, <b>micropitting</b> damage increases with decreasing film thickness as may be expected, but when some wear is present <b>micropitting</b> damage may reduce as film thickness is lowered to the point where wear takes over and removes the asperity peaks and hence reduces asperity interactions. Similarly, when wear is negligible, increased sliding can increase the level of <b>micropitting</b> by increasing the number of asperity stress cycles, but when wear is present, an increase in sliding may lead to a reduction in <b>micropitting</b> due to faster removal of asperity peaks. The results suggest that an ideal situation in terms of surface damage prevention is that in which some mild wear at the start of gear pair operation adequately wears-in the tooth surfaces, thus reducing subsequent <b>micropitting,</b> followed by zero or negligible wear {{for the rest of the}} gear pair life. The complexities of the interaction between the contact conditions, wear and surface fatigue, as evident in the present results, mean that a full treatment of gear <b>micropitting</b> requires a numerical model along the lines of that applied here, and that use of overly simplified criteria may lead to misleading predictions...|$|E

40|$|<b>Micropitting</b> was studied using a three-contact disc machine {{having a}} central roller {{in contact with}} three harder, annular counter-discs (“rings”) of {{precisely}} controlled roughness. Roughness, running conditions, base stock and additive concentration were varied. The response of the same lubricants in a reciprocating sliding wear test operating in the boundary regime was also studied. It was reported in previous work that when a common antiwear additive, secondary zinc dialkyl-dithio-phosphate (ZDDP) is used in solution into a mineral oil, it provides enough protection to the rough surfaces leading to <b>micropitting.</b> In this work, different type of roughness finish, effect of lambda ratio on <b>micropitting,</b> effect of the antiwear concentration, {{as well as the}} effect of a friction modifier were studied. Results of experimental studies of the rolling contact behaviour of carburised steel rollers are reported. All the tests with the additive present led to <b>micropitting.</b> This being true for both longitudinal and transverse finish. However, transverse led to most severe case of <b>micropitting</b> wear. For different film thickness, <b>micropitting</b> was observed for various lambda ratio, however, <b>micropitting</b> wear was only observed for a calculated film thickness below 12 % of the centre-line average roughness of the rings. It was found that there was an approximately inverse correlation between the <b>micropitting</b> damage in the disc machine test and the mild wear in the reciprocating sliding test. The surface profiles were measured at given intervals during each test and the result confirmed that the nature of the antiwear additive slow-down the run-in of rough surfaces contributing to the onset of <b>micropitting.</b> Indeed, antiwear additives suppress the gradual smoothing of the rough surfaces, which takes place when a pure base stock is used under mild conditions. For cases closer to industry, it is common to use a combination of additives for various reasons. Indeed, antiwear and friction modifier additives are often used in formulated oils, a combination which leads to reduced boundary friction. The effect of the reduction of the friction at the asperity level was studied. A common friction modifier agent, commonly known as molybdenum dithio-carbamate (MoDTC), was added in solution to a mineral oil containing the antiwear additive. It was found that for the oil containing both ZDDP blended with MoDTC the surface of the tested roller exhibited <b>micropitting</b> wear. However, this <b>micropitting</b> wear gradually disappeared with continued running; {{this was not the case}} when the mineral oil was tested with ZDDP alone. The optical micrographs of the damaged surfaces showed that the subsurface cracks disappeared on the roller tested with ZDDP and MoDTC. After the test, further surface analysis of the counter-discs showed the presence of MoS 2 deposits on the asperity crests. The oil containing the friction modifier was tested using an MTM tribotester and this test confirmed the reduction in friction for a regime close to boundary lubrication. It is speculated that the improved <b>micropitting</b> behaviour resulted from the effect of a reduction in local tensile stress due to reduced asperity friction. This may have reduced the opening of the surface cracks and inhibited their extension. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Merely the {{presence}} of compressible entities, known as bubbles, greatly enriches the physical phenomena encountered when introducing ultrasound in a liquid. Mediated by the response of these bubbles, the otherwise diffuse and relatively low energy density of the acoustic field can induce strong, localized liquid motion, high internal temperatures and pressures as well as secondary acoustic emissions. In turn, these effects give rise to considerable stresses exerted on nearby objects and molecular dissociation of the bubble constituents. These unique characteristics of acoustic cavitation enable {{a wide variety of}} applications, notably ultrasonic cleaning and sonochemistry. Scientific knowledge of cavitation bubbles predominantly comprises the dynamics and effects of pre-existing spherical bubbles in an infinite liquid medium. Much less is known about the origin of cavitation bubbles or their behavior when in close proximity to a solid surface. A disparity that {{can be attributed to the}} experimental difficulties posed by the microscopic length- and timescales combined with the rapid and unpredictable motion which characterizes cavitation bubbles. Still, for successful application of acoustically driven bubbles, thorough understanding of their coming into existence as well as their interaction with solid surfaces is of great importance. In this thesis both these aspects are investigated. An emphasis is placed on the role of microbubbles entrapped inside artificially created <b>micropits.</b> This is motivated by two reasons. First of all, acoustic cavitation bubbles are believed to originate mostly from stable microscopic volumes of gas entrapped in naturally occurring crevices inside a solid object. An artificially created <b>micropit</b> thus constitutes a model for such a crevice. Secondly, modern micromachining techniques enable precise control over the dimensions and locations of such <b>micropits.</b> This greatly facilitates the experimental study of acoustically driven <b>micropit</b> bubbles and the various aspects of the therewith induced surface acoustic cavitation...|$|R

This article investigates gear <b>micropitting</b> of high-speed stage gears of a wind turbine gearbox operating under nominal and varying load and speed conditions. Based on the ISO standard of gear <b>micropitting</b> (ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2010) and considering the operating load and speed conditions, a theoretical study is carried out to assess the risk of gear <b>micropitting</b> by determining the contact stress, sliding parameter, local contact temperature and lubricant film thickness along the line of action of gear tooth contact. The non-uniform distributions of temperature and lubricant film thickness over the tooth flank are observed due to the conditions of torque and rotational speed variations and sliding contact along the gear tooth flanks. The lubricant film thickness varies along the tooth flank and is at the lowest when the tip of the driving gear engages with the root of the driven gear. The lubricant film thickness increases with the increase of rotational speed and decreases as torque and sliding increase. It can be concluded that <b>micropitting</b> is most likely to initiate at the addendum of driving gear and the dedendum of driven gear. The lowest film thickness occurs when the torque is high and the rotational speed is at the lowest which may cause direct tooth surface contact.

Experimental and analytical results showed that TDP delays the Zinc DialkylDithioPhosphate (ZDDP) anti-wear tribofilm formation. TDP in combination with ZDDP induces a thinner and smoother anti-wear tribofilm with a modified chemical structure composed of mixed Fe/Zn (poly) phosphates.

Cells were inseminated in the well in front of a microchannel array and their movement and stretching behavior against the microchannel array including the entrance and exit terraces were observed using a microscope-TV camera-time lapse video recorder system for 24 hours. Cells entered into the entrance terrace and showed active motions including extending pseudopodia into the channels and whole cell passage through the channels, and fully stretched in the entrance terrace in 8 hours or so.

The load applied on the discs and thus the contact pressuredid not affect the <b>micropitting</b> of the surfaces in the range studied. The effects of surface machining and surface treatments were finally considered: ground surfaces showed better resistance to <b>micropitting</b> than surfaces obtained by turning, and the benefits of shot peening were exposed. The influence of surface roughness and material properties on the resistance to pitting is discussed in the light of these results...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{characterize}} the microstructure of a commercially pure titanium (cpTi) surface etched with HCl/H 2 SO 4 (AE-cpTi) and to investigate its in vitro cytocompatibility compared to turned cpTi (T-cpTi). T-cpTi showed a grooved surface and AE-cpTi revealed a surface characterized by the presence of <b>micropits.</b> Surface parameters indicated that the AE-cpTi surface is more isotropic and present a greater area compared to T-cpTi. The oxide film thickness was similar between both surfaces; however, AE-cpTi presented more Ti and O and less C. Osteoblastic cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and bone-like nodule formation were greater on T-cpTi than on AE-cpTi. These results show that acid etching treatment produced a surface with different topographical and chemical features compared to the turned one, and such surface modification affected negatively the in vitro cytocompatibility of cpTi as demonstrated by decreasing culture growth and expression of osteoblastic phenotype...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{ultrasonic}} device {{with the ability}} to locally remove deposited layers from a glass slide in a controlled and rapid manner. The cleaning takes place as the result of cavitating bubbles near the deposited layers and not due to acoustic streaming. The bubbles are ejected from air-filled cavities micromachined in a silicon surface, which, when vibrated ultrasonically at a frequency of 200 kHz, generate a stream of bubbles that travel to the layer deposited on an opposing glass slide. Depending on the pressure amplitude, the bubble clouds ejected from the <b>micropits</b> attain different shapes as a result of complex bubble interaction forces, leading to distinct shapes of the cleaned areas. We have determined the removal rates for several inorganic and organic materials and obtained an improved efficiency in cleaning when compared to conventional cleaning equipment. We also provide values of the force the bubbles are able to exert on an atomic force microscope tip. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [[URL]...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the ejection of bubbles from air-filled pits micromachined on a silicon surface {{when exposed to}} ultrasound at a frequency of approximately 200 kHz. As the pressure amplitude is increased the bubbles ejected from the <b>micropits</b> tend to be larger and they interact in complex ways. With more than one pit, there is a threshold pressure beyond which the bubbles follow a trajectory parallel to the substrate surface and converge at the center point of the pit array. We have determined the size distribution of bubbles ejected from one, two and three pits, for three different pressure amplitudes and correlated them with sonochemical OH radical production. Experimental evidence of shock wave emission from the bubble clusters, deformed bubble shapes and jetting events {{that might lead to}} surface erosion are presented. We describe numerical simulations of sonochemical conversion using the empirical bubble size distributions, and compare the calculated values with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{was carried}} out at the Life Testing Department of the SKF Engineering & Research Centre located in Nieuwegein (NL) and deals with roller bearings testing. The aims of the work are to study some early signs of <b>micropitting</b> damage on the rolling surfaces and {{to determine whether they}} can be detected by a condition monitoring system. First of all, the literature about rolling contact fatigue was reviewed, with a focus on <b>micropitting</b> damage. It was found that micropitted areas usually develop around geometric features like furrows, scratches or indentations. A previously tested roller bearing showing this kind of damage was selected and a failure analysis was done with the aid of microscopy. The characteristics of the micropitted areas were investigated, in terms of appearance and size. Moreover, two basic engineering models were implemented to evaluate the risk of <b>micropitting</b> and their applicability to bearings testing was investigated. An experimental activity {{was carried out}} to monitor the development of a micropitted spot, both in terms of size and effects on the vibration signal. The micropitted bearing was run under conventional operating conditions and periodically dismounted to see how the damage was proceeding. Its vibration signal was acquired with the condition monitoring system currently in use in the Life Testing Department and also with a pilot system developed in parallel with this dissertation, both of them implementing the enveloping technique. Enveloped vibration data were then processed looking for any evidence of this early damage. Finally, signals from more than 30 undamaged bearings were acquired to determine a baseline behavior to be compared with the micropitted bearing. On the basis of the results of this research, a growth rate for the micropitted spots was estimated and an initiation and development mechanism proposed. Both basic <b>micropitting</b> models were found representative of a widespread damage distribution, whereas local <b>micropitting</b> around geometric features can be simulated only with advanced models taking into account their exact shape. Finally, it was found that a time domain analysis of the enveloped vibration signal is not suitable for the detection of early signs of <b>micropitting,</b> mainly because those thought to be evidences of the damage were found in undamaged bearings as well...|$|E

40|$|International audienceHybrid {{bearings}}—that is, bearings with ceramic {{rolling elements}} and steel rings—are {{often used in}} applications with reduced (i. e., boundary or mixed) lubrication conditions. The mechanisms by which hybrid bearings perform significantly better than full-steel ones in these cases are so far unclear, although a number of published works have shown experimental results in which appreciable performance benefits were obtained {{by the use of}} hybrid bearings under boundary or mixed lubrication. In this article, the reduced lubrication performance of hybrid rolling contacts, versus full-steel ones, is studied in detail by means of rolling bearing fatigue experiments and a theoretical <b>micropitting</b> model. It is found that the large improvement in surface fatigue resistance of hybrid contacts cannot be explained {{solely on the basis of}} the unavoidable differences in some of the roughness parameters existing between the full-steel and hybrid contacts. It is also necessary to take into account a considerable reduction in the effective boundary friction coefficient of the hybrid contact. In the numerical <b>micropitting</b> simulations it was found that the boundary friction coefficient of a hybrid contact must be about two times lower than that for the corresponding full-steel contact, in order to be able to predict the experimental observations reasonably well. A similar ratio of the boundary friction coefficients was obtained in a number of dedicated tests, thus confirming the results of the <b>micropitting</b> model. The mechanisms of the strong <b>micropitting</b> resistance of hybrid bearings under reduced lubrication conditions are discussed in detail, shedding new light on the operational tribology and performance capabilities of bearings with rolling elements made of silicon nitride ceramics...|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} {{of stainless steel}} 304 {{in the presence of}} aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was investigated in a continuous flow system using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examinations. The results show that the open circuit potential (OCP) of stainless steel was ennobled (shifted in the electropositive direction) by about 150 mV {{in the presence of the}} aerobic bacteria. The observed change of OCP in the electropositive direction can be explained by an increase in the rate of the cathodic reaction. Also the presence of an aerobic biofilm led to a decrease in the polarization resistance of stainless steel is not only due to the growth of <b>micropits,</b> as shown from SEM micrographs, but also due to thinning of the passive film. In the presence of only Pseudomonas fragi, the electrochemical impedance response showed a capacitive behavior with RP on the order of 500 kV. The addition of anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) to the test medium decreased RP to 12 kV due to a...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle {{manufacturers}} today face increasing {{demands to}} produce fuel efficient vehicles. If {{this is to}} be successfully achieved, the reduction of energy losses is vital [1]. One approach to loss reduction is to use lower viscosity trans mission fluids to reduce splash (churning) losses in the drive-train. However, this introduces potential problems in regard to the durability of machine components due to reduction in oil film thickness [2]. As regards gear transmission, the durability is mainly related to the formation of <b>micropits</b> on parts of gears where sliding is high, which later lead to pitting damage. The formation of <b>micropits</b> is due to surface stress which can be reduced by fluids that form thick EHD films or reduce sliding friction. In order to determine if these same lubricant properties as well as other parameters, known to influence the fuel efficiency of axle lubricants, also affect contact fatigue damage in rolling contacts, an extensive experimental study using a rolling four ball test was performed. The tests were performed with a series of fluids that form thin and thick EHD films and have low and high sliding friction. Additionally, these fluids have been formulated to hav e high and low hydrodynamic friction. All these fluids contai ned additive packages that meet the API GL- 5 gear oil specifications. The different properties of the lubricating fluids were controlled by changes to the base oils as well as addition of friction modifiers. The results have shown that it is possible do distinguish the pitting properties of the different lubricants by using rolling four ball tests. A multiple linear regression statistical analysis was performed with the use of Matlab for evaluating the results obtained from rolling four ball tests. The statistical model developed, showed that some of the physical properties of fluids that a ffect fuel efficiency have an impact on pitting performance of the lubricants. The ball test specimens from rolling four ball tests have been analyzed by using SEM/ EDS and XPS in order to characterize the tribochemical films and understand the damage mechanisms.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the mechanism of}} fatigue crack initiation in austenitic stainless steels (SSs) in light water reactor (LWR) coolant environments. The effects of key material and loading variables, such as strain amplitude, strain rate, temperature, level of dissolved oxygen in water, and material heat treatment on the fatigue lives of wrought and cast austenitic SSs in air and LWR environments have been evaluated. The influence of reactor coolant environments on the formation and growth of fatigue cracks in polished smooth SS specimens is discussed. Crack length {{as a function of}} fatigue cycles was determined in air and LWR environments. The results indicate that decreased fatigue lives of these steels are caused primarily by the effects of the environment on the growth of cracks < 200 {micro}m and, to a lesser extent, on enhanced growth rates of longer cracks. A detailed metallographic examination of fatigue test specimens was performed to characterize the fracture morphology. Exploratory fatigue tests were conducted to enhance our understanding of the effects of surface <b>micropits</b> or minor differences in the surface oxide on fatigue crack initiation...|$|R
