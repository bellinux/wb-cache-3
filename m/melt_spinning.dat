50|$|Investment at the {{beginning}} of the 1970s focused on modernization and streamlining. This was the only way the increasingly brisk competition could be countered. The group's management decided that the Oberbruch site should pioneer this modernization, since it had gained strategic importance with the textile polyester yarn PET. With an annual production of more than 43,000 tons it became the biggest polyester filament plant of the Group. Innovative spinning techniques now included high-speed <b>melt</b> <b>spinning</b> and spin-stretching. Advancing polyester condensation was another target. However, the oil crisis of 1973-1974 damaged the investment program. Only 4 high-speed <b>melt</b> <b>spinning</b> machines were installed.|$|E

The viscosity of mesophase pitch is more sensitive to temperature than other melt-spun materials. Therefore, during the creation of pitch based fibers the temperature and heat transfer rate must be carefully controlled.|$|E

A cooling step is necessary {{in the case of}} <b>melt</b> <b>spinning</b> and evaporation of solvent in the case of dry spinning.

The {{martensitic}} {{transformation of}} a <b>melt</b> <b>spun</b> Ti 5 oNi 25 Cu 25 alloy (cubic B 2 s orthorhombic B 19) {{has been investigated}} by means of thermo-mechanical cycling.

However a new phenomena not yet completely understood has been observed during the cycling experiments under constant load. For the direct transformation, although the net shape change is an elongation, the strain-temperature e(T) curve has a region with a local contraction (opposite to the external load).

50|$|The high {{strength}} of carbon fiber {{can be attributed}} to these four main processes. Having high levels of crystalline regions allows the fibers to withstand high levels of stress. These crystalline regions are formed via the <b>melt</b> <b>spinning</b> process; the crystals are stiff areas that do not deform when an external stress is applied. Orienting and aligning these crystalline regions gives further strength to the fibers, specifically if the orientation is along the fiber axis. Carbonization and graphitization are the two processes responsible for this alignment of the crystalline regions. Pitch based carbon fiber is lower in strength than fiberglass; however, it has a very high elastic modulus.|$|E
