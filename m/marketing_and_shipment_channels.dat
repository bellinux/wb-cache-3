50|$|On August 18, 2011, then-CEO of HP Leo Apotheker {{announced}} plans for a partial or full spinoff of the Personal Systems Group. The PC unit had the lowest profit margin although it accounted for {{nearly a third of}} HP’s overall revenues in 2010. HP was still selling more PCs than any other vendor, shipping 14.9 million PCs {{in the second quarter of}} 2011 (17.5% of the market according to Gartner), while Dell and Lenovo were tied for second place, each with more than a 12% share of the <b>market</b> <b>and</b> <b>shipments</b> of over 10 million units. However, the announcement of the PC spinoff (concurrent with the discontinuation of WebOS, and the purchase of Autonomy Corp. for $10 billion) was poorly received by the <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> after Apotheker's ouster, plans for a divestiture were cancelled. In March 2012, the printing and imaging division was merged into the PC unit. In October 2012, according to Gartner, Lenovo took the lead as the number one PC manufacturer from HP, while IDC ranked Lenovo just right behind HP. In Q2 2013, Forbes reported that Lenovo ranked ahead of HP as the world’s number one PC supplier.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an empirical}} approach for identifying bank specialization in ex-port <b>markets.</b> Combining loan <b>and</b> <b>shipment</b> data for all exporters in Peru, {{we find that}} all banks have abnormally large and persistent loan portfolio exposures {{to at least one}} export destination market. Specifications that saturate all bank-time and firm-time variation show that firms that expand exports to a country are more likely to borrow from banks that specialize in that country. This link between exports and bank specialization holds both for existing and new lending relationships. Using dif-ferential exposure to the 2008 financial crisis, we further find that shocks to the credit supply of banks has a larger effect on exports to the bank’s markets of specialization, implying that specialized bank debt is difficult to replace. These results suggest that banks have market-specific areas of expertise that are distinct from firm-specific knowl-edge gathered through relationship lending...|$|R

Using a cross section of monthly firm-product-destination level French export data we confirm that firms adjust on both margins for market size.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{simultaneous}} optimization of prices <b>and</b> <b>shipment</b> quantities in a supply network when the supplier has the market power to set prices, thereby influencing demand directly. We focus on the distribution stage of the supply chain where the firm’s products are shipped from several locations (plants, warehouses) to various independent <b>markets,</b> <b>and</b> address the following questions: (i) {{what is the best}} price at each <b>market?,</b> <b>and</b> (ii) what is the best distribution plan given these prices? The combined problem can be modeled as a nonlinear optimization problem. For its solution, we propose an iterative linear programming approach that utilizes shadow price information from a series of successive transportation problems. To evaluate the heuristic’s effectiveness, we compare it with a “brute-force ” enumeration using a grid-search. The grid-search is implemented on a spreadsheet with a programming loop to facilitate repeated invocation of the transportation problem solver routine...|$|R

The vendor's problem is to determine an integrated policy for inventory replenishment <b>and</b> <b>shipment</b> release <b>and</b> to set its parameters. We develop analytical models for computing such integrated policies where it is economical to use common carriage for outbound transportation. We propose algorithmic approaches to set the optimal policy parameter values. Shipment consolidation Vendor-managed inventory Common carrier...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by the {{increasing}} prevalence of flexibility hedging in corporate-level risk management programs, this paper {{focuses on the}} treatment of hedging operational risks in the coordinated replenishment <b>and</b> <b>shipment</b> for distribution systems. The forward option pricing model with the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model for stochastic demand forecasting is adopted for constructing inventory volume flexibility. We therefore propose a hedge-based coordinated inventory replenishment <b>and</b> <b>shipment</b> (HCIRS) methodology for flexibly making inventory hedging and optimal routing assignment decisions as well as coordinating replenishment <b>and</b> <b>shipment</b> policies. The HCIRS methodology provides insight into strategic flexibility adopted for a real-life inventory-distribution problem faced {{by one of the}} major East Asia food supply networks and turns out to be very efficient. The proposed HCIRS methodology has provided evidence of better results than the traditional operational techniques for the presented case in this paper.
