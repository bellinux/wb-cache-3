40|$|Avian {{leukosis}} virus subgroup J (ALV-J) {{can cause}} a variety of neoplasms, including mainly <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> (myelocytomatosis) and nephromas. Other tumours, such as histiocytic sarcoma (HS), haemangiosarcoma and mesothelioma, may also develop. In a previous article we described {{a case in which}} <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis,</b> haemangiomas and leiomyosarcomas appeared simultaneously in a commercial layer flock with infection by ALV-J. The present research was completed to understand the molecular characteristics of the ALV-J strain that induced clinical <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis,</b> haemangiomas and leiomyosarcomas. Two strains of ALV-J (SDAU 1001 and SDAU 1002) were isolated and identified, and their full-length sequences were analysed. The complete genome nucleotide sequences of these two isolates were different in length, 7652 nt and 7636 nt, respectively. They shared 98. 9 % identity with each other, and 93. 4 % to 97. 8 % nucleotide identity to the reference ALV-J isolates. A 19 -nucleotide repeat sequence was identified in the primer binding site (PBS) leader region of isolate SDAU 1001. A base substitution mutation (base 15 C-T) in this insertion was identified. However, the identical insertion at the same site was not found in SDAU 1002. The gag and pol genes of the two viruses were more conserved than the env gene. One key deletion in the E element was a common feature of SDAU 1001 and SDAU 1002. SDAU 1001 and SDAU 1002, possibly recombinants of ALV-J and another avian retrovirus, may share the same ancestor. Co-infection by SDAU 1001 and SDAU 1002 isolates is a possible explanation why <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis,</b> haemangiomas, and leiomyosarcomas appeared simultaneously in the same commercial layer flock...|$|E
40|$|Subgroup J avian {{leukosis}} virus (ALV-J) is a recently identified avian oncogenic retrovirus responsible for severe economic losses worldwide. In {{contrast with the}} other ALV subgroups, ALV-J predominantly induces <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> in meat-type chickens. Despite significant homology with the other ALV subgroups across most of the genome, the envelope protein of ALV-J (EnvJ) shares low homology with the others. Pathogenicity and <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> induction map to the env gene of ALV-J. A chimeric protein composed of the surface domain of EnvJ fused to the constant region of a rabbit IgG and mass spectrometry were used to identify the chicken Na+/H+ exchanger type 1 (chNHE 1) as a binding protein for ALV-J. Flow cytometry analysis and coprecipitation experiments demonstrated a specific interaction between EnvJ and chNHE 1. When introduced into nonpermissive human 293 T cells and quail QT 6 cells, chNHE 1 conferred susceptibility to EnvJ-mediated infection. Furthermore, 293 T cells expressing chNHE 1 fused with 293 T cells expressing EnvJ in a low-pH-dependent manner. Together, these data identify chNHE 1 as a cellular receptor for the highly pathogenic ALV-J...|$|E
40|$|Myelocytes {{blood cell}} tumor in chicken {{is a disease}} caused by retrovirus, avian {{leukosis}} virus subgroup J (ALV-J). The virus has the same group as human retrovirus (HIV) which caused AIDS, but the avian type possesses oncogenic properties, that could induce cell transformation and tumor formation. ALV-J stimulates the bone marrow's myelocytes and transforms them into tumor cell myelocytoma. The tumor cells then metastasis through the circulatory system causing <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> and tumor cells accumulation in various internal organs or myelocytomatosis. This study was done {{on the base of}} the leukosis behavior of the tumor. The finding of the metastasis tumor cell in the blood smear examination is thought could be use as the diagnostic clue of the disease. Blood smear from sick chickens are collected and stained with some chemical staining substance such as may grunwald-giemsa, hematoxyllin eosin, periodic acid Schiff, congo red, toluidine blue, and sudan black B. Cytochemistry character of the blood cells was observed using light microscope. The result showed that myelocytes granules were best observed using hematoxyllin eosin, periodic acid Schiff, congo red and toluidine blue while may grunwald-giemsa, and sudan black B could not differentiate the granules. By this method, the field veterinarian will able to screen the suspected chicken flock for <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> earlier than the occurrence of tumor formation...|$|E

40|$|Twenty pullets {{and adult}} chickens, aged 100 to 403 days, from several {{commercial}} chicken farms were examined by gross and histopathology. Grossly, all chickens had white-greyish masses in the visceral organs {{with or without}} enlargement of the peripheral nerves. Histopathological examination revealed Marek’s disease (MD) lymphoma, lymphoid leukosis (LL) and <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> (ML) in 14 / 20, 5 / 20 and 1 / 20 of the chickens, respectively. Lesions of the sciatic nerves in chickens diagnosed as having MD lymphoma were various. No neoplastic and/or inflammatory cells were noted in the peripheral nerves of chickens diagnosed as having LL and ML. These results indicated that MD lymphoma could also develop in older chickens; thus, microscopic examination is needed to identify MD in older chickens showing lymphocyte-derived tumours...|$|E
30|$|Avian {{leukosis}} (AL) {{is caused}} by the avian leukosis virus (ALV), which is associated with a variety of malignant neoplasms, including lymphoid and <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis,</b> and other production problems in chickens (Witter, 1997). AL is found in most countries that have large-scale farms {{and is one of the}} most harmful diseases in the poultry industry, causing serious economic losses (Sun and Cui 2007; Zhang et al. 2011). The ALV p 27 gene is a highly conserved gene among the different subtypes of ALV, and the p 27 antigen is a serogroup-specific antigen. This antigen can be detected by ELISA for many kinds of samples for the diagnosis of avian leukosis, such as albumen, vaginal secretions, meconium, cloaca cotton swab, and also can be used to detect the propagation of the virus (Spencer et al. 1984; Spencer et al. 1976; De Boer et al. 1984).|$|E

Subgroup J {{avian leukosis}} virus (ALV-J) is a recently identified avian oncogenic retrovirus responsible for severe economic losses worldwide. In {{contrast to the}} other ALV strains, ALV-J predominantly infects and induces <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> in meat-type chickens. Despite significant homology with the other ALV subgroups across most of the genome, the envelope protein of ALV-J (EnvJ) shares low homology with the others. Pathogenicity and <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> induction map to the env gene of ALV-J. A chimeric protein composed of the surface (SU) domain of EnvJ fused to the constant region (Fc) of a rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mass spectrometry were employed to identify the chicken Na +/H+ exchanger 1 (chNHE 1) as a binding protein for ALV-J. Flow cytometry analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a specific interaction between EnvJ and chNHE 1. When introduced into non-permissive human 293 T cells and quail QT 6 cells, chNHEI conferred susceptibility to EnvJ-mediated infection. Furthermore, 293 T cells expressing chNHE 1, but not huNHE 1, fused with 293 T cells expressing EnvJ in a low pH dependent manner. Together these data identify chicken NHE 1 as a cellular receptor for the highly pathogenic subgroup J ALV. ^ In an attempt to produce highly efficient and specific gene delivery vectors, we developed a lentiviral-based double-pseudotyped vector in which two different proteins are incorporated into the viral membrane to separate the receptor binding and membrane fusion functions. The first protein (HA/TSLV), a mutant form of influenza hemagglutinin deficient for intrinsic receptor-binding function, supplies the membrane fusion machinery. The second protein (Tva/ZZ), a modified cell-surface molecule containing two copies of the IgG-binding domain from staphylococcal protein A, binds to specific ligands/epitopes on target cells through specific antibodies. In vitro studies demonstrate that vector coated with anti-folate receptor α (FRα) efficiently and specifically infected cells expressing FRα. Application of this novel vector is demonstrated by efficient and specific transduction of tumor cells through a tumor-specific antibody and by efficient transduction of intact airway epithelium from the apical surface both in vitro and in vivo. ...|$|E
40|$|HPRS- 103, the {{prototype}} of avian leukosis virus (ALV) subgroup J, is a recently identified retrovirus associated with <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> in meat-type chickens. Although this virus shows high sequence identity to other ALV subgroups within the gag and pol genes, its env gene is highly diverged (with only about 40 % sequence identity) from other ALV subgroups. On the other hand, the sequence of the env gene of HPRS- 103 was 75 % identical to that of E 51, {{a member of the}} EAV family of endogenous avian retroviruses. It is reported here that the chicken genome also contains another EAV-related element, EAV-HP, showing much greater sequence identity (over 97 %) to the HPRS- 103 env gene. Southern blotting analysis showed that EAV-HP-related sequences were distinct from EAV- 0 and were present in all lines of chicken examined and in grey jungle fowl, but were absent from several other avian species. The potential role of these endogenous sequences in the evolution of ALV subgroup J viruses is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Subgroup J avian {{leukosis}} virus (ALV-J) was first isolated from meat-type chickens that had developed <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> and since 2008, ALV-J infections in chickens have become widespread in China. A {{comparison of the}} sequence of ALV-J epidemic isolates with HPRS- 103, the ALV-J prototype virus, revealed several distinct features, {{one of which is}} a 19 -nucleotide (nt) insertion in the leader sequence. To determine the role of the 19 -nt insertion in ALV-J pathogenicity, a pair of viruses were constructed and rescued. The first virus was an ALV-J Chinese isolate (designated rSD 1009) containing the 19 -nt insertion in its leader sequence. The second virus was a clone, in which the leader sequence had a deleted 19 -nt sequence (designated rSD 1009 △ 19). Compared with rSD 1009 △ 19, rSD 1009 displayed a moderate growth advantage in vitro. However, no differences were demonstrated in either viral replication or oncogenicity between the two rescued viruses in chickens. These results indicated that the 19 -nt insertion contributed to ALV-J replication in vitro but was not related to its pathogenicity in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Avian {{leukosis}} virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is a {{new type}} of virus that mainly induces <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> (ML) in chickens. To further elucidate the pathogenesis of ALV-J infection and tumor development, expression profiles from the bone marrow tissue of 15 infected and 18 non-infected birds from a local-breed poultry-farm under naturally infected conditions, were analyzed by suppression-subtractive hybridization. The birds were diagnosed as ML+ (or ML-) by specific ALV-J detection methods, involving serological tests for antigens and antibodies, and RT-PCR to detect viral RNA. A total of 59 partial gene sequences were revealed by differential screening of 496 forward and 384 reverse subtracted cDNA clones. Of these, 22 identified genes, including 8 up-regulated and 14 down-regulated, were related to immune functions, these genes being, MHC B-G antigen, translationally-controlled tumor protein (TPT 1 /TPTC), transferrin and ferritin, hemoglobin and Carbonic anhydrase. Four of the down-regulated genes were selected for further analysis, in view of their predicted roles in infection and immunity by real-time qRT-PCR, using RNA collected from the same birds as those used for SSH. The four genes were expressed at significantly lower levels (p < 0. 001) in ALV-J infected birds than in non-infected ones...|$|E

The nucleotide sequence of the env gene of the variant viruses showed several substitutions resulting in amino acid changes especially clustered in the variable regions hr 1, hr 2 and vr 3. Analysis of the data suggests that selection pressure, probably from the immune response, is driving the antigenic variation among the isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences showed the evolutionary relationships of the isolates with HPRS- 103 and the EAV family of endogenous avian retroviruses. The epidemiological significance of the antigenic variation and the emergence of variant viruses are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Subgroup J avian {{leukosis}} virus (ALV-J) was first isolated frommeat-type chickens that developedmyeloid leukosis (ML). In recent years, field cases of hemangioma (HE) or HE andML, rather thanML alone, {{have been reported}} in commercial layer flocks exposed to ALV-J with a high incidence in China. Here we report the complete genomic sequence of an ALV-J isolate that caused both HE andML in egg-type andmeat-type chickens in China. These findings will provide additional insights into the molecular characteristics in genomes, host range, and pathogenicity of ALV-J. The J subgroup of {{avian leukosis}} virus (ALV-J) is the latest ad-dition to the list of avian leukosis virus subgroups identified in chickens. Since ALV-J was first isolated in 1989 from white meat-type chickens with myelocytomatosis in Great Britain, ALV-J has primarily induced <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> (ML) in meat-type chickens and caused enormous economic losses for the poultry industry worldwide (1, 2, 4, 7, 8). In recent years, field cases of infection and tumors caused by ALV-J in commercial layers and breeders have been emerging in China, which resulted in bleeding claws and surrounding skin, yellowish-white tumors on the visceral surface, and drastically reduced egg production (1, 2, 4, 9).

40|$|Avian {{leukosis}} virus subgroup J (ALV-J), {{the most}} recent member of the avian retroviruses, is predominantly associated with <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> in meat-type chickens. We have previously demonstrated that the acutely transforming virus strain 966, isolated from an ALV-J-induced tumor, transformed peripheral blood monocyte and bone marrow cells in vitro and induced rapid-onset tumors, suggesting transduction of oncogenes (L. N. Payne, A. M. Gillespie, and K. Howes, Avian Dis. 37 : 438 – 450, 1993). In {{order to understand the}} molecular basis for the rapid transformation and tumor induction, we have determined the complete genomic structure of the provirus of the 966 strain. The sequence of the 966 provirus clone revealed that its genome is closely related to that of HPRS- 103 but is defective, with the entire pol and parts of the gag and env genes replaced by a 1, 491 -bp sequence representing exons 2 and 3 of the c-myc gene. LSTC-IAH 30, a stable cell line derived from turkey monocyte cultures transformed by the 966 strain of ALV-J, expressed a 72 -kDa Gag-Myc fusion protein. The identification of the myc gene in 966 virus as well as in several other ALV-J-induced tumors suggested that the induction of myeloid tumors by this new subgroup of ALV occurs through mechanisms involving the activation of the c-myc oncogene...|$|E
40|$|Among the six {{subgroups of}} Avian {{leukosis}} virus (ALV) that infect chickens, subgroup J (ALV-J) was isolated from meat-type chickens where it predominantly induces <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> (ML) and erythroblastosis (EB). The sequence of HPRS- 103, the ALV-J prototype virus, shows several distinct features, {{one of which}} is the presence of a distinct hairpin stem–loop structure called the E (also called XSR) element in the 39 untranslated region. In order to determine the role of the E element in ALV-induced pathogenicity, a comparison was made of the oncogenicity of viruses derived from the provirus clones of parental and E element-deleted HPRS- 103 viruses in two genetically distinct lines of birds. In line 15 I birds, deletion of the E element had profound effects on virus replication in vivo, as only 55 % of birds showed evidence of infection, compared with 100 % infection by the parental virus. Furthermore, none of the line 15 I birds infected with this virus developed tumours, indicating that the E element does contribute to the oncogenicity of the virus. On the other hand, deletion of the E element had only a marginal effect on the incidence of tumours in line 0 birds. These results indicate that, although the E element per se is not absolutely essential for tumour induction by this subgroup of viruses, it does contribute to oncogenicity in certain genetic lines of chicken...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of known virus-encodedmicroRNAs (miRNAs) are derived from polymerase II transcripts encoded by DNA viruses. A recent demonstration that the bovine leukemia virus, a retrovirus, uses RNA polymerase III to directly tran-scribe the pre-miRNA hairpins to generate viral miRNAs further supports the common notion that the canonical pathway of miRNA biogenesis does not exist commonly among RNA viruses. Here, we show that an exogenous virus-specific region, termed the E element or XSR, of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J), a member of avian retrovirus, encodes a novel miRNA, desig-nated E (XSR) miRNA, using the canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway. Detection of novel microRNA species derived from the E (XSR) element, a 148 -nucleotide noncoding RNAwith hairpin structure, showed that the E (XSR) element has the potential to function as a microRNA primary transcript, demonstrating a hitherto unknown function with possible roles in <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> associated with ALV-J.

40|$|Abstract Background Avian {{leukosis}} virus subgroup J (ALV-J) preferentially induces <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukosis</b> (ML) in meat-type birds. Since 2008, many clinical {{cases of}} hemangioma rather than ML have frequently {{been reported in}} association with ALV-J infection in Chinese layer flocks. Results Three ALV-J strains associated with hemangioma were isolated and their proviral genomic sequences were determined. The three isolates, JL 093 - 1, SD 09 DP 03 and HLJ 09 MDJ- 1, were 7, 670, 7, 670, and 7, 633 nt in length. Their gag and pol genes were well conserved, with identities of 94. 5 - 98. 6 % and 97. 1 - 99. 5 %, respectively, with other ALV-J strains at the amino acid level (aa), while the env genes of the three isolates shared a higher aa identity with the env genes of other hemangioma strains than with those of ML strains. Interestingly, two novel 19 -bp insertions in the U 3 region in the LTR and 5 ' UTR, most likely derived from other retroviruses, were found in all the three isolates, thereby separately introducing one E 2 BP binding site in the U 3 region in the LTR and RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIB and core promoter motif ten elements in the 5 ' UTR. Meanwhile, two binding sites in the U 3 LTRs of the three isolates for NFAP- 1 and AIB REP 1 were lost, and a 1 -base deletion in the E element of the 3 ' UTR of JL 093 - 1 and SD 09 DP 03 introduced a binding site for c-Ets- 1. In addition to the changes listed above, the rTM of the 3 ' UTR was deleted {{in each of the}} three isolates. Conclusion Our study is the first to discovery the coexistence of two novel insertions in the U 3 region in the LTR and the 5 ' UTR of ALV-J associated with hemangioma symptoms, and the transcriptional regulatory elements introduced should be taken into consideration in the occurrence of hemangioma. </p...|$|E
