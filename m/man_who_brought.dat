25|$|Initial {{investigation}} {{indicated that}} the bombings were perpetrated by the militant Islamist Caucasus Emirate group. On March 31, Caucasus Emirate leader Doku Umarov claimed responsibility for ordering the attacks in a video released on the internet. He also stated that such attacks in Russia would continue unless Russia grants independence to Muslim states in the North Caucasus region. The <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>brought</b> the suicide bombers to Moscow was arrested in July 2010. The Anti-Terror Committee of Russia confirmed in August 2010 that Magomedali Vagabov, along with four other militants, {{was killed in an}} operation in Dagestan.

25|$|Santana {{was born}} in Autlán de Navarro, Jalisco, Mexico. He learned to play the violin at age five and the guitar at age eight {{under the tutelage of}} his father, a mariachi musician. His younger brother, Jorge Santana, would also become a {{professional}} guitarist. Young Carlos was heavily influenced by Ritchie Valens {{at a time when there}} were very few Mexicans in American rock and pop music. The family moved from Autlán de Navarro to Tijuana, the city on Mexico's border with California, and then San Francisco. Carlos stayed in Tijuana but later joined his family in San Francisco.

25|$|After the {{campaign}} ended, Forrest regrouped his corps in northern Mississippi, where {{he attempted to}} replenish his equipment and recruit additional men, even offering a twenty-day furlough to any <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>brought</b> in a new recruit. In January, Richard Taylor named Forrest commander of all cavalry units in the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana; Forrest reorganized his forces into four divisions split along state lines, commanded by Chalmers, Buford, Jackson, and Tyree Bell. Union diversions staged throughout {{the early months of}} 1865 forced Forrest to disperse his men across a wide region. In late March, Union Major General James H. Wilson started a massive raid through Alabama, with the intention of destroying Confederate industrial centers, especially the factories located at Selma, Alabama. Forrest attempted to delay Wilson near Plantersville on April 1 in order to gain time for his scattered force to concentrate but Wilson overran the Confederate positions, taking 300 prisoners and forcing Forrest to retreat into the defenses of Selma. Once in Selma, Forrest attempted to gather every man capable of fighting, including the local home guard and militia, into the city's defenses works but he had too few troops to adequately man the works. Wilson launched an attack in the late afternoon of April 2 and quickly overran the defenses, capturing 2,700 men and thirty cannons while losing only 350 men himself. Over the next few weeks, Forrest attempted to gather and reorganize his corps; when he received word that Taylor had surrendered his department, Forrest formally surrendered his command on May 9.|$|E
500|$|Several factors {{combined}} {{to make the}} Battle of Svolder {{one of the most}} famous battles of the Viking Age. In Norwegian-Icelandic historiography, King Olaf Tryggvason was held in high regard as the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>brought</b> Christianity to the North. His colourful end in a battle against overwhelming odds therefore makes a fitting narrative. Jarl Eirik's court poets also ensured their lord a fair share of the glory. Mesta says: ...|$|E

500|$|Presley's {{physical}} attractiveness {{and sexual}} appeal were widely acknowledged. [...] "He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful", {{in the words}} of critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, [...] "I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence." [...] His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as [...] "the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl." [...] In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as [...] "the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>brought</b> overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America." [...] Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.|$|E
