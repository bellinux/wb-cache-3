It <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> someone.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{ends with}} Munch {{revealing}} to Thormann that he lights the candle each night [...] "for all {{the ones who}} have been killed," [...] while Thormann admits that he re-lit it in Munch's absence because he knew it <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
500|$|Burt Reynolds {{was chosen}} for [...] "Improbable" [...] after he {{expressed}} his desire to appear in an episode of The X-Files to Robert Patrick. Carter approved the idea and told Patrick that he would [...] "write something good". He later noted that [...] "as a young man, [...] <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> me" [...] and that {{the opportunity to work}} with him was [...] "surreal". After Carter had written the script, he presented it to Reynolds for his approval; Reynolds approved of the script and agreed to be in the episode. Robert Patrick later noted that Reynolds [...] "had a great time, and he loved working with everybody." ...|$|E
50|$|The word bau (bꜣw), plural of {{the word}} ba, <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> similar <b>to</b> 'impressiveness', 'power', and 'reputation', {{particularly}} of a deity. When a deity intervened in human affairs, {{it was said that}} the Bau of the deity were at work 1982.|$|R
5000|$|David Hilbert was {{the first}} to invoke the term [...] "metamathematics" [...] with {{regularity}} (see Hilbert's program). In his hands, it <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> akin <b>to</b> contemporary proof theory, in which finitary methods are used to study various axiomatized mathematical theorems (Kleene 1952, p. 55).|$|R
5000|$|Old English terms cognate with seiðr are siden and sidsa, both {{of which}} are attested only in {{contexts}} that suggest that they were used by elves (ælfe); these seem likely <b>to</b> have <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> similar <b>to</b> seiðr. Among the Old English words for practitioners of magic are wicca (m.) or wicce (f.), the etymons of Modern English [...] "witch".|$|R
500|$|In Moonwalk (1988), Jackson {{said his}} {{relationship}} with Shields was [...] "romantically serious for a while." [...] Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together. The suggestions were met with disapproval from Shields, who felt {{such a move would}} have [...] "divided [...] life too much". She recalled: [...] "There were times when he would ask me to marry him, and I would say, 'You have {{me for the rest of}} your life, you don’t need to marry me, I’m going to go on...have my own marriage and my own kids, and you’ll always have me.' I think it made him relax. He didn’t want to lose things that <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Plugged In criticized Perry's {{decision to}} create an uplifting song about such a serious subject matter as divorce: [...] "Framing the song {{in terms of her}} divorce from Brand, though 'Part of Me', puts a much more somber and serious spin on things. This is no mere breakup. It's the demolition of a marital covenant. So no matter how bad things were in her relationship, no matter how much better she feels now, no matter how cathartic the pulsing beats (courtesy of hitmeisters Max Martin and Dr. Luke) might feel, the ultimate end here is a very sad one indeed." [...] Priya Elan of NME panned the song: 'This is the part of me, that you're never going to take away from me,' [...] "she sings in that strange angry robot voice of hers. The sentiment, as ever, is punch you in face crystal clear and probably <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> one of the (probably) 17 writers who wrote the song. As it stands, it's another de-humanised slab of radio pop from Perry INC." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{compilation}} of Orbison's most successful songs updated and re-recorded {{was released in}} 1987 under the title In Dreams: The Greatest Hits. It coincided {{with the release of}} the dark and surreal mystery thriller Blue Velvet, [...] directed by David Lynch. Orbison was astonished at the way Lynch used [...] "In Dreams". In the film, a murderous and morally bankrupt psychopath named Frank Booth (played by Dennis Hopper) is obsessed with the song and demands it be played over and over, calling it [...] "Candy Colored Clown". In one scene it is lip-synced by a flamboyantly effeminate character played by Dean Stockwell, after which Booth becomes enraged and beats the protagonist. Lynch later stated, [...] "it is a beautiful song and it was written by Roy... Those lyrics, that feel <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> him. And it just so happened that a song in a certain situation could mean something else. And the way that Frank Booth used that song in two different places, it is just kind of unbelievable. But I can see why Roy was upset because for him it meant a third thing." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Duck soup" [...] was American English slang at that time; it <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> easy <b>to</b> do. Conversely, [...] "to duck something" [...] {{meant to}} avoid it. When Groucho was {{asked for an}} {{explanation}} of the title, he quipped, [...] "Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, youll duck soup {{for the rest of your}} life." ...|$|R
5000|$|All of {{the tracks}} {{performed}} by outside bands <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> special <b>to</b> the show. [...] "I'm Game" [...] was composed by Christophe Beck, who also composed seasons two through four of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and was used throughout the series as a theme for whenever Angel or his team were involved in heroic actions. [...] "Touched" [...] was considered by many fans to be a theme of the show, and VAST's music {{was used in the}} original unaired pilot episode of Angel.|$|R
50|$|In an {{interview}} with Austrian television in 2006, the 52-year-old Klammer was asked about his greatest achievement. He answered that although his {{gold medal at the}} Olympic Games in Innsbruck was generally regarded as his greatest career achievement, winning at Kitzbühel in 1984 <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> very special <b>to</b> him, considering he hadn't won there since 1977.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{multiple}} nu metal musicians rejected the nu metal label, Limp Bizkit's vocalist Fred Durst defended it, saying [...] "Nu metal let people open up and it <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> people. It really did." [...] Coal Chamber's vocalist Dez Fafara also defended nu metal. He said he is proud {{to be associated with}} the subgenre and that nu metal bands [...] "broke new musical ground" [...] saying, [...] "I think 'hair metal' was cheesy. [...] I think 'nu metal' was different. I think what's beautiful about 'nu metal' is it's different. And you've got so many different influences." [...] Chester Bennington of Linkin Park said he accepts the nu metal label, saying: ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in {{the finale}} of season three, {{on the day}} of their wedding, Burke told Cristina that he no longer wished to make her do {{anything}} against her will, and realized he was trying to make Cristina the woman he wanted her to be, and not accept her as the woman she is. Cristina said she [...] "thought this was what she wanted." [...] He wanted her to say she knew it was what she wanted, so he left her in the chapel. Cristina then returned to their apartment and discovered Burke had left, taking with him the things that <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> only him (his trumpet, his Eugene Foote collection, his grandmother's picture, and his lucky scrub cap), leaving Cristina devastated.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the request}} of Eliot's wife, Vivienne, {{a line in the}} A Game of Chess section was removed from the poem: [...] "And we shall play a game of chess/The ivory men make company between us / Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door". This section is {{apparently}} based on their marital life, and she may have felt these lines too revealing. However, the [...] "ivory men" [...] line may have <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> Eliot: in 1960, thirteen years after Vivienne's death, he inserted the line in a copy made for sale to aid the London Library, of which he was President at the time; it fetched £2,800. Rupert Hart-Davis had requested the original manuscript for the auction, but Eliot had lost it long ago (though it was found in America years later).|$|E
50|$|The {{lightness}} of narrative style disguises {{an undercurrent of}} poignance. Even in the moments of utter grief, the author cannot let go of humour. Intense tragedy is dished out {{as if it were}} <b>something</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> make the readers laugh.|$|R
2500|$|In Robertson-Lorant's {{assessment}} of the friendship, Melville was [...] "infatuated with Hawthorne's intellect, captivated by his artistry, and charmed by his elusive personality," [...] and though the two writers were [...] "drawn together in an undeniable sympathy of soul and intellect, the friendship <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> different <b>to</b> each of them," [...] with Hawthorne offering Melville [...] "the kind of intellectual stimulation he needed." [...] They may have been [...] "natural allies and friends," [...] yet they were also [...] "fifteen years apart in age and temperamentally quite different," [...] and Hawthorne [...] "found Melville's manic intensity exhausting at times." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{abolition}} of the GLC in 1986 also <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> had <b>to</b> be done to provide for future elections to the ILEA. It was first suggested that the ILEA could {{be made up of}} delegates from the 12 inner London Boroughs, but the Conservative Group on the ILEA was strongly against this policy and eventually it was decided that there would be direct elections. Morrell led Labour into the campaign, and with London hostile to the {{abolition of}} the GLC, Labour won an easy victory. Morrell was re-elected quite narrowly herself, as the SDP had a strong challenge.|$|R
2500|$|Cindy grow {{close and}} begin a relationship. Stephanie Waring, who portrays Cindy, said the pair [...] "bring {{out the best}} in each other". Pickard {{explained}} that when Cindy ends the relationship because he does not plan to marry her, his character is shocked that he [...] "misses Cindy. They talk things through and, out of the blue, Tony proposes in jest. But Cindy goes along with it..." [...] He explained that Tony is unaware of Cindy's true nature although he did suspect Cindy to be manipulating him for a while. Pickard added that Cindy will [...] "want to get married as soon as possible before Tony can change his mind". He added that Cindy is [...] "acting like she genuinely loves him and he desperately wants that love" [...] so he remains unsuspicious towards her and her plans to scam him. Despite her plans, Pickard felt Cindy has [...] "some feelings" [...] for Tony. He felt that Tony has [...] "fallen for her, yes. It surprises him but she's started to mean a lot to him. Cindy's smart and sexy and they're good together". Pickard felt that if his character discovered Cindy and Darren Osborne's (Ashley Taylor Dawson) plans to scam him he would be [...] "furious but also he'd be really down about it. It would upset him to think they were trying to con him but he'd be angry with himself for being so gullible". He added that [...] "Tony thinks [...] never have agreed to marry him if Darren still <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> her".|$|E
60|$|Daylight's {{tone was}} whimsically plaintive, but {{secretly}} he was delighted with her confession of loneliness. It was almost worth {{the loss of}} the mare to get that out of her. At any rate, he <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> her. He was not utterly unliked.|$|E
6000|$|BRASSBOUND. I don't deny that: nothing makes {{a man so}} selfish as work. But I was not self-seeking: {{it seemed}} to me that I had put justice above self. I tell you life <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> me then. Do you see that dirty little bundle of scraps of paper? ...|$|E

5000|$|Fighting among Charlemagne's grandchildren {{caused the}} Carolingian empire to be {{partitioned}} into several parts by the Treaty of Verdun (843), the Treaty of Meerssen (870), and the Treaty of Ribemont. The German region developed {{out of the}} East Frankish kingdom, East Francia. From 919 to 936, the Germanic peoples - Franks, Saxons, Swabians, and Bavarians - were united under Henry the Fowler, Duke of Saxony, who took the title of king. For the first time, the term [...] "Kingdom (Empire) of the Germans" [...] (Regnum Teutonicorum) was applied to a Frankish kingdom, although Teutonicorum at its founding originally <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> closer <b>to</b> [...] "Realm of the Germanic peoples" [...] or [...] "Germanic Realm" [...] than [...] "realm of the Germans".|$|R
5000|$|Operetta {{grew out}} of the French opéra comique around the middle of the 19th century, to satisfy a need for short, light works in {{contrast}} to the full-length entertainment of the increasingly serious opéra comique. By this time, the [...] "comique" [...] part of the genre name had become misleading: Georges Bizet's Carmen (1875) is an example of an opéra comique with a tragic plot. The definition of [...] "comique" [...] <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> closer <b>to</b> [...] "humanistic," [...] meant to portray [...] "real life" [...] in a more realistic way, representing tragedy and comedy next to each other, as Shakespeare had done centuries earlier. With this new connotation, opéra comique had dominated the French operatic stage since the decline of tragédie lyrique.|$|R

60|$|He passed away, {{and left}} the room with a little thrill of satisfaction. He had {{contrived}} to impress the one woman whom he was anxious to impress!

5000|$|Running {{lines are}} made fast (unmoving) by {{belaying}} them to (wrapping them around) a cleat or a belaying-pin {{located in a}} pin-rail or fife-rail. Wrapping the rope holds it tight and prevents the line from slipping, i.e. stops it. Thus to [...] "belay" [...] <b>something</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> stop or cease it in naval slang ("belay that noise!").|$|R
2500|$|Rowling {{pretended to}} bang {{her head against}} the sofa in mock frustration. [...] "SO {{much has been made of}} that," [...] she groans, noting that it was only done where words had been used that really <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> very {{different}} <b>to</b> Americans. Her American editor pointed out that the word jumper – British for pullover sweater – means a kind of dress in American. She had had no idea. [...] "He asked, 'Can we change it to sweater,' which is just as British?" [...] That was fine with Rowling.|$|R
5000|$|Blair {{observes that}} when the word module first emerged in {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries, it <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> very close <b>to</b> model. It implied a {{small-scale}} representation or example. By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the word had come to imply a standard measure of fixed ratios and proportions. For example, in architecture, the proportions of a column could be stated in modules (i.e., [...] " [...] a height of fourteen modules equaled seven times the diameter measured at the base") and thus multiplied to any size while still retaining the desired proportions.|$|R

60|$|It <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{get into}} the Century in those days. The praise of its editor was {{equivalent}} to a diploma. I regarded Gilder as second only to Howells in all {{that had to do}} with the judgment of fiction. Flower's interests were ethical, Gilder's esthetic, and after all my ideals were essentially literary. My reform notions were subordinate to my desire to take honors as a novelist.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, ESA devised {{plans for}} its own space station called Columbus which could be {{attached}} to NASA's Space Station Freedom. America objected to ESA's using Columbus as building block of a future European space station, and were concerned that they would facilitate {{the creation of a}} potential competitor if the manned space outpost fulfilled its promise as supplier of commercially viable products, such as new materials and pharmaceuticals. Plans were scaled down as a result, and by 1988, Europe proposed to participate with three elements: Attached Pressurized Module, Man Tended Free-Flying platform, plus an unmanned polar remote sensing platform. This would be supported by the Ariane 5 rocket and the Hermes spaceplane (a mini space shuttle). However, after German reunification, ESA's budget reductions <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> had <b>to</b> be cancelled.|$|R
