60|$|Viewed in this light, the scab, {{who gives}} more labor power {{for a certain}} price than his fellows, is not so generous after all. He is no more generous with his energy than the chattel slave and the convict laborer, who, by the way, are the almost perfect scabs.

60|$|I hope I {{have made}} it clear that I was proud to be one of Nature's strong-armed noblemen. The dignity of labor was to me the most {{impressive}} thing in the world. Without having read Carlyle, or Kipling, I formulated a gospel of work which put theirs in the shade. Work was everything. It was sanctification and salvation. The pride I took in a hard day's work well done would be inconceivable to you. It is almost inconceivable to me as I look back upon it. I was as faithful a wage slave as ever capitalist exploited. To shirk or <b>malinger</b> on the man who paid me my wages was a sin, first, against myself, and second, against him. I considered it a crime second only to treason and just about as bad.|$|E
40|$|<b>Malingering</b> of a {{cognitive}} deficit (i. e. memory and/or intellectual functioning) commonly occurs in {{civil and criminal}} cases. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the relationship between <b>malingering</b> and personality traits in civil cases. 63 participants (46 male, 17 female) seeking financial compensation following an accidental injury and referred for a neuropsychiatric assessment completed the Test of <b>Malingering</b> (TOMM), the Ravens Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM), and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-RS). 23 participants (36. 5 %) <b>malingered</b> on the TOMM and four (6. 3 %) <b>malingered</b> on the RSPM. No significant difference was found in the personality scores between the malingerers and non-malingerers. Regression analyses, using <b>malingering</b> on the TOMM as a continuous outcome variable, showed no effects of personality on the extent of <b>malingering</b> on Trial 1, Trial 2 or Retention trial. There was no agreement found between independent clinical impressions and <b>malingering</b> on the tests. The lack of a relationship between <b>malingering</b> and personality suggests that <b>malingering</b> is situation specific and influenced by ‘adaptational’ factors (i. e., a cost-benefit analysis) rather than ‘criminological’ motivational factors. The findings suggest that <b>malingering</b> tests should be administered routinely in assessments of civil compensation cases...|$|R
40|$|<b>Malingering</b> {{to obtain}} {{medications}} of abuse {{is well documented}} in the general medical setting. However, we have found no cases previously reported of such <b>malingering</b> in a veterinary setting. We report five cases submitted by veterinarians in which clients (pet owners) are strongly suspected or confirmed to have been engaging in <b>malingering</b> to obtain controlled medications for their personal use. Cases bear {{a striking resemblance to}} <b>malingering</b> in the general medical setting for drugs to abuse. We propose that veterinarians, like their medical counterparts, are potential targets of <b>malingering</b> by their clients for drugs of abuse. Because of their familiarity with this condition, psychiatrists may have a role in training veterinarians to recognize <b>malingering</b> on the part of their human clients. In addition, psychiatrists may benefit from familiarizing themselves with novel forms of <b>malingering,</b> such as are presented in this case series.

We used to say: 'A man will lie, or a man will cheat, in his own interest; that is human nature'; but that is no longer human nature with us, perhaps because no man has any interest to serve; he has only the interests of others to serve, while others serve his. It is in no wise possible for the individual to separate his good from the common good; he is prosperous and happy only as all the rest are so; and therefore it is not human nature with us for any one to lie in wait to betray another or seize an advantage.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>malingering</b> and suboptimal performance on neuropsychological tests {{has become a}} major interest of clinical neuropsy-chologists. Methods to detect <b>malingering</b> have focused on specialized tests or embedded patterns associated with <b>malingering</b> present in the conventional neuropsychology tests. There are two stages to the study of their validity. The first stage involves whether the method can dis-criminate <b>malingering</b> subjects from those who are not <b>malingering.</b> In the second stage, they must be examined for their relationship to the conventional tests used to establish impairment and disability. Constantinou, Bauer, Ashendorf, Fisher, and McCaffrey (2005. Is poor per-formance on recognition memory effort measures indicative of generalized poor performance on neuropsychological tests? Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology, 20, 191 – 198.) conducted the only study in which correlations are presented between a commonly used symptom validity test, the Test of Memory <b>Malingering</b> (TOMM) and the subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R). A factor analysis was conducted using these correlations. It revealed a clear <b>malingering</b> factor that explained significant variance in the TOMM and the WAIS-R subtests. The relationship of <b>malingering</b> with cognitive tests is complex: some tests are sensitive to malinger-ing and others are not. Factor analysis can summarize the magnitude of variance associated with each test and reveal the patterns of inter-relationships between <b>malingering</b> and clinical tests. The analysis also suggested that <b>malingering</b> assessment methods could be improved by the addition of timing the responses...|$|R
40|$|The Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test (M-FAST) is a {{relatively}} new measure shown to be a valid and effective tool for screening psychiatric <b>malingering</b> in criminal forensic and psychiatric inpatient settings. The present study attempts to cross-validate the M-FAST in civil forensic and neurologic samples. Three-hundred-eight civil forensic patients referred by their attorneys for neuropsychological testing were studied. Assessment batteries administered included tests of both psychiatric and neurocognitive feigning. Based on these “gold standards, ” 4 sets of contrasts were formed in order to examine how the M-FAST performs in identifying psychiatric <b>malingering,</b> neurocognitive <b>malingering,</b> any <b>malingering</b> (including either or both types of <b>malingering),</b> as well as any <b>malingering</b> among a neurologic subset of this sample. At the level of group discrimination, the M-FAST Total score performed well in all contrasts. However, at the level of individual classification rates, although the M-FAST Total score was well supported for identifying psychiatric feigning, when neurocognitive <b>malingering</b> was present, performance dropped considerably. Thus, using the M-FAST recommended cutting score of 6, the M-FAST was able to successfully identify psychiatric malingering; however, the M-FAST is not an appropriate measure to use for identifying neurocognitive <b>malingering</b> within this sample...|$|R

50|$|Individuals who <b>malinger</b> PTSD {{may have}} several motivations for doing so. First, {{financial}} incentives are common. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs offers substantial annual financial compensation to U.S. veterans who {{can prove that}} they suffer from PTSD related to their military service. This potential compensation can create an incentive for veterans to <b>malinger</b> PTSD. Furthermore, the U.S. Social Security Administration offers social security disability payments to individuals documenting a disorder such as PTSD that impedes their ability to work, which additionally provides an incentive to <b>malinger</b> PTSD. Additionally, the potential for workers compensation can motivate individuals reporting a traumatic event at their workplace to fabricate PTSD; and finally the potential for personal injury lawsuits can motivate someone to <b>malinger</b> PTSD and sue an individual for causing PTSD {{as a result of}} attack, accident or other stressor.|$|E

The application of this procedure to 20 people accused under the judicial system of Social Security fraud for <b>malingering</b> a permanent work incapacity by way of a mental disorder, showed that the procedure described in the GES was effective for the correct classification of the <b>malingers.</b> Furthermore, data supported the categorising of <b>malingers,</b> consisting of whole <b>malingers</b> (those mentally healthy that effectively simulate a permanent work incapacity), partial <b>malingers</b> (those with temporary or no mental work incapacity disease, who claim for a permanent work incapacity), over <b>malingers</b> (those with permanent work incapacity mental disorders who exaggerate the severity of their mental health) and incompetent <b>malingers</b> (those who claimed to have permanent work incapacity but in their mental health assessment, were observed to have no mental health disorder.).

40|$|Background and purpose: It {{remains unknown}} whether {{psychological}} distress causes <b>malingering</b> {{in patients with}} psychogenic symptoms. Methods: We studied 26 patients with psychogenic neurological disorders on psychopathology and <b>malingering</b> in comparison with 26 patients with various neurological conditions and 18 matched healthy controls (HC). Results: Psychogenic patients showed {{the highest levels of}} psychological complaints and <b>malingering,</b> but non-psychogenic neurological patients also showed significantly more psychological distress and <b>malingering</b> compared with HC. Psychological distress was related to the degree of <b>malingering,</b> in both patient groups. Conclusion: This data does not formally support a causal relationship between psychological distress and psychogenic neurological disorders, but suggests that a part of the psychological complaints is a general result of having an illness. The clinical implication {{of this study is that}} psychological distress is not sufficient for diagnosing functional complaints. Also, if a patient scores normal on a test for <b>malingering,</b> this does not mean that he or she is not suffering from psychogenic symptoms...|$|R

40|$|In {{forensic}} context, {{the psychological}} or psychiatric assessment {{occurs in a}} particular and different way than the usual practice in psychotherapy, and <b>malingering</b> has a specific dimension in this context. This article focuses on <b>malingering</b> in situations of damages compensations. We analyse this behaviour through {{the study of the}} victimisation process, the family influence, the existent psychological tests and the examiner’s role. The injured persons are placed or place their-self in a victim position that seems to be a factor involved in their reconstruction process and by this way, in the use of <b>malingering.</b> The family has also a strong influence on the management of the traumatic incident and by this way, on the (conscious or unconscious) choice of <b>malingering,</b> particularly for children (by example, in the Munchausen by proxy syndrome).
