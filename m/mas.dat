5|$|By mid 1918, the new {{commander}} of the Austrian fleet, Konteradmiral Miklós Horthy decided to conduct another attack on the Otranto Barrage, similar to the Otranto Raid from December 1916, to allow more German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats to safely get through the heavily defended strait of Otranto. During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola with Prinz Eugen and Viribus Unitis. Tegetthoff and , along with one destroyer and six torpedo boats departed Pola on 9 June. At about 3:15 {{on the morning of}} 10 June, two Italian <b>MAS</b> boats, <b>MAS</b> 15 and <b>MAS</b> 21, spotted the Austrian fleet steaming south. The <b>MAS</b> platoon was commanded by Capitano di fregata Luigi Rizzo while the individual boats were commanded by Capo timoniere Armando Gori and Guardiamarina di complemento Giuseppe Aonzo respectively. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage each of the dreadnoughts. <b>MAS</b> 21 attacked Tegetthoff, but her torpedoes missed the battleship. Despite missing Tegetthoff, the other boat, <b>MAS</b> 15, managed to hit Tegetthoffs sister ship Szent István with her torpedoes at about 3:25am. Both boats were then chased away from the scene by Austrian escort vessels.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{approval}} of the new Constitution, the 2009 general election was called. The opposition sought to delay the election by demanding a new biometric registry system, hoping that it would give them time to form a united front against <b>MAS.</b> Many <b>MAS</b> activists reacted violently against the demands, and attempting to prevent this. Morales went on a five-day hunger strike in April 2009 to push the opposition to rescind their demands. He also agreed to allow for the introduction of a new voter registry, but insisted that it was rushed through so as not to delay the election. Morales and the <b>MAS</b> won with a landslide majority, polling 64.2%, while voter participation had reached an all-time high of 90%. His primary opponent, Reyes Villa, gained 27% of the vote. The <b>MAS</b> won a two-thirds majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Morales notably increased his support in the east of the country, with <b>MAS</b> gaining a majority in Tarija.|$|E

She continually fired on suspected submarine periscopes until she rejoined Szent István at 4:45.|$|E

5|$|The Caribbean Carnival is an {{important}} part of Dominican culture. Originally featuring masquerade songs (chanté <b>mas)</b> and other local traditions, traditional Carnival, <b>Mas</b> Domnik, came to be dominated by imported calypso music and steel bands in the early 1960s; calypso appealed to Carnival-goers because the lyrical focus on local news and gossip was similar to that of chanté <b>mas,</b> despite a rhythmic pattern and instrumentation which contrast sharply with traditional Dominican <b>Mas</b> Domnik music. After a fire in 1963, the traditional Carnival was banned, though calypso and steelpan continued to grow in popularity. Modern Carnival on Dominica takes place on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, and is a festive occasion during which laws against libel and slander are suspended. The modern Dominican Carnival is heavily based on the Trinidadian celebration, but is not as commercialized due to a lack of corporate sponsorship.|$|E
5|$|The <b>MAS</b> gained {{increasing}} popularity as {{a protest}} party, relying largely on widespread {{dissatisfaction with the}} existing mainstream political parties among Bolivians living in rural and poor urban areas.

Their campaign was successful, and in the 2002 presidential election the <b>MAS</b> gained 20.94% of the national vote, becoming Bolivia's second largest party, being only 1.5% behind the victorious MNR, whose candidate, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, became President. They won 8 seats in the Senate and 27 in the Chamber of Deputies.
