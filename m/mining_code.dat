5|$|A {{central part}} of the {{non-discrimination}} policy is the <b>Mining</b> <b>Code</b> of 7 August 1925. It is uncertain if the code is internationally binding, or if it can be amended unilaterally by Norway. Specifically, the commissioner issues licenses to search for minerals and state-owned and other owner's land and to register claims. To maintain a claim, the owner must work 1,500 man-hours per five years and pay an annual fee of 6,000 Norwegian krone. However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry may grant exceptions from the work obligation under specific conditions.|$|E

A <b>mining</b> <b>code</b> was passed in 1925, and by 1927 all mining claims, some of which conflicted, were resolved. All unclaimed land was taken over by the Government of Norway. Although the Soviet Union was initially skeptical to the treaty, its government was willing to sign in exchange for a Norwegian recognition of the Soviet regime. Until the Second World War, both the governor and the Commissioner of Mining were a single person, stationed on the mainland during the winter.|$|E

We also highlight new voluntary, regional and transnational initiatives, driven {{by a host of}} heterogeneous actors from Africa and abroad, which constitute a ‘fourth’ generation of <b>mining</b> <b>codes</b> and natural resource governance practices that place primary emphasis on transparency and accountability by both mining companies and host governments. This new generation of natural resource governance initiatives presents new opportunities as well as unique challenges, particularly with the growing role of emerging economies such as the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa).

25|$|The World Bank {{has been}} {{involved}} in mining since 1955, mainly through grants from its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, with the Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency offering political risk insurance. Between 1955 and 1990 it provided about $2 billion to fifty mining projects, broadly categorized as reform and rehabilitation, greenfield mine construction, mineral processing, technical assistance, and engineering. These projects have been criticized, particularly the Ferro Carajas project of Brazil, begun in 1981. The World Bank established <b>mining</b> <b>codes</b> intended to increase foreign investment; in 1988 it solicited feedback from 45 mining companies on how to increase their involvement.|$|R

40|$|An {{objective}} of unit testing {{is to achieve}} high structural coverage of the code under test. Achieving high structural coverage of object-oriented code requires desirable method-call sequences that create and mutate objects. These sequences help generate target object states such as argument or receiver object states (in short as target states) of a method under test. Automatic generation of sequences for achieving target states is often challenging due to a large search space of possible sequences. On the other hand, code bases using object types (such as receiver or argument object types) include sequences {{that can be used}} to assist automatic testgeneration approaches in achieving target states. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called MSeqGen, that <b>mines</b> <b>code</b> bases and extracts sequences related to receive...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose the idea of {{constructing}} an Object Repository — a repository of code snippets that, when executed, produce an instance of some class.

Gold mining in Mali has increased dramatically, with more than 50 tonnes in 2007 from less than half a tonne produced annually {{at the end of the}} 1980s. Mining revenue totaled some 300 billion CFA francs in 2007 more than a thirty times increase from the 1995 total national mining revenue of less than 10 billion CFA.
