40|$|A {{program of}} studies on hard {{diffraction}} and very forward physics with CDF [...] II has been proposed, which foresees adding to CDF two very forward "MiniPlug" calorimeters designed to measure the energy and lateral position of both electromagnetic and hadronic showers. The <b>MiniPlugs</b> will consist of lead/liquid scintillator read out by wavelength-shifting fibers arranged in a pixel-type towerless geometry suitable for "calorimetric tracking". We present here test-beam results obtained with a 28 radiation length prototype. For positrons in the range 5 - 120 GeV, the energy resolution {{was measured to be}} oe/E = 18. 1 % / p E + 0. 6 % and the position resolution 9. 2 mm / p E; for charged pions in the range 10 - 230 GeV a position resolution of 23. 9 mm / p E was obtained.

40|$|Abstract. Two <b>MiniPlug</b> calorimeters, {{designed}} to measure the energy and lateral position of particles in the (forward) pseudorapidity region of 3. 6 < |η | < 5. 2 of the CDF detector, have been recently installed {{as part of the}} Run II CDF upgrade at the Tevatron ¯pp collider. They consist of lead/liquid scintillator read out by wavelength shifting fibers arranged in a pixel-type towerless geometry suitable for ‘calorimetric tracking’. The design concept, the prototype performance and the final design of the MiniPlugs are here described. A recent cosmic ray test resulted in a light yield of approximately 100 pe/MIP, which exceeds our design requirements. ...|$|E
40|$|The CDF Forward Detector upgrade {{project was}} {{designed}} to enhance the capabilities for diffractive physics at the Tevatron. It consists of a Roman Pot spectrometer to detect leading antiprotons, a set of counters near and around the beam-pipe to reject the non-diffractive event contamination to the data sample, and two <b>Miniplug</b> calorimeters to measure the event energy flow in the very forward rapidity region. In the novel design of the Miniplugs, a lead/liquid-scintillator is read out by wave-length shifting fibers arranged in a flexible tower geometry and relatively short depth allows calorimetric tracking. Performance of the Forward Detectors {{during the first two}} years of operation in Run II with colliding proton-antiproton beams at √ s= 1. 96 TeV, as well as the first results obtained, are discussed. A measurement of the antiproton momentum loss using the Forward Detectors is also presented. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of light quality on growth and metabolic activity during pre-cultivation (in <b>miniplug</b> containers) of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) and wild cherry (Prunus avium) plants was investigated. Seedlings were grown in a growth chamber {{for a month}} under light-emitting diode (LED) light or fluorescent light. The LED lamps (Valoya) {{used in this study}} emitted a continuous spectrum thanks to a mixture of blue, green, red and far-red LEDs. Our results showed that plant response to light quality seems {{to be related to the}} plant species. In particular, in beech seedlings fresh and dry weight, shoot height and leaf area were greatest when plants were cultured under LED light, and lowest under fluorescent lamps. Furthermore, we found that LED-induced reduction of chlorophyll contents in beech and holm oak leaves resulted in an increase of the carboxylase capacity of Rubisco in the same plant species suggesting an improvement of light-use-efficiency in these plants. These results indicate that LED light may be suitable for the culture of plants in tightly controlled environments. The comparison of malondialdehyde levels between LED and fluorescent grown plants strongly supports this idea...|$|E
40|$|Exclusive Higgs production, {{in which}} the event {{consists}} of nothing but the leading protons and a Higgs boson, has been proposed as a channel in which to study {{the properties of the}} Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Although we do not expect to observe exclusive Higgs-boson production at the Tevatron, we can observe similar processes which provide a calibration for theoretical predictions of exclusive Higgs production at the LHC. The CDF measurements of exclusive dijet and diphoton production, examples of such processes, are presented in Sec. 2. Single diffraction has been studied extensively at the Tevatron in Run I, including diffractive dijet and W/Z-boson production. New results with extended kinematical reach allowed by the larger Run II dataset are presented in Sec. 3. CDF II includes forward detectors designed for studying diffractive physics. The <b>MiniPlug</b> calorimeters cover the pseudorapidity region 3. 5 <|{eta}|< 5. 1. Beam Shower Counters (BSC) surrounding the beampipe in several locations detect particles in the forward region 5. 4 <|{eta}|< 7. 4. A spectrometer consisting of three Roman-pot detectors preceded by Tevatron dipoles is used to track diffractive antiprotons which have lost a fraction 0. 03 <{zeta}< 0. 10 of the beam momentum...|$|E
