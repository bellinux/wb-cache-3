[...] "Since our arrival at this happy spot, {{we have had a}} ham, sometimes a shoulder of bacon, to grace the head of the table; a piece of roast beef adorns the foot, and a dish of beans or greens, almost imperceptible, decorates the center. When the cook has a mind to cut a figure, which I presume will be the case to-morrow, we have two beefsteak pies, or dishes of crabs, in addition, one {{on each side of the}} center dish, dividing the space, and reducing the distance between dish and dish to about six feet, which without them would be twelve feet apart. Of late, he has had the surprising sagacity to discover that apples will make pies, and it is a question if in the violence of his efforts we do not get one of apples instead of having both of beefsteak. If the ladies can put up with such entertainment, and will submit to partake of it on plates once tin, now iron (not become so by scouring), I shall be happy to see them." ...|$|R

50|$|On {{the night}} of October 2 he camped {{on the bank of}} Cache Creek (Sacramento River) where Cacheville was situated. He and his friend helped an old {{man by the name of}} Thomas Cochran build a hut for a country tavern and soon after {{proceeded}} on their way to the northern mines. During the next summer he worked in the Trinity mines, saving about $500, soon stolen from him by a deceitful fellow traveler. He returned to Cacheville, repulsed with mining, and worked as a cook for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cochran</b> he had earlier met. In the fall of 1851 <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cochran</b> left for Australia, owing Mr. Griffith and others a significant amount of money, and was never since heard from — except in a letter from San Francisco to Mr. Griffith. Griffith then managed a hotel along with a man by the name of William Hammack until the autumn of 1852, when J. A. Hutton, who owned land nearby, came with his wife and they and Hammack became proprietors. In the fall of 1853 they opened a store and hired Mr. Griffith as clerk, for a salary of $75 a month with board.|$|E

500|$|Davenport's {{marriage}} had failed by 1909, and {{he suffered a}} breakdown that year, related to his ongoing divorce case. As he recovered, he announced a forthcoming series to be available for license to newspapers, [...] "Men I have sketched". [...] This project was aborted when, in 1911, Davenport was invited by Hearst {{to return to the}} American. He was on assignment for the American on April 19, 1912, when he met the RMS Carpathia at the docks in New York to draw the survivors of the RMS Titanic. [...] He drew three cartoons, but upon leaving his office was in a [...] "highly nervous state". [...] That evening he fell ill at the apartment of a friend, <b>Mrs.</b> William <b>Cochran,</b> a medium and spiritualist. Diagnosed with pneumonia, he died in her home two weeks later, on May 2, 1912. Hearst paid for eight doctors to treat Davenport, and later for an elaborate funeral—the publisher had Davenport's body returned to his beloved Silverton for burial. [...] His funeral was a freethought service conducted by a spiritualist, Jean Morris Ellis.|$|R

5000|$|The Club {{was founded}} in 1911 by Alexander Smith Cochran, {{a member of the}} Yale Class of 1896 and Wolf's Head Society. As an {{undergraduate}} he had regretted the lack of a congenial atmosphere in which to discuss literature and the arts with classmates and faculty. In 1910 he began to assemble a small but exceptional collection of first and early editions of the Elizabethan and Jacobean plays that he had studied with William Lyon Phelps, and in 1911 he offered the collection to Yale as the central point of interest for a club where conversation - and tea — would be available every afternoon. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cochran</b> also provided a Clubhouse, with quarters for a resident steward, and a generous endowment of $100,000. His portrait hangs above the fireplace in the Vault Room, and his birthday (28 February) is marked by an annual Founder’s Dinner. The life portrait of the Virgine Queene in the Tea Room, attributed to Federico Zuccari, came with the founder’s original gift. Began during the literary renaissance at the university between 1909 and 1920, the club attracted such book collectors as Phelps, Chauncey Brewster Tinker, and John Berdan.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit also {{applied the}} [...] "materiality" [...] test in its {{decision}} in United States v. Cochran. Robert M. Cochran was a bond underwriter in Oklahoma {{who was convicted}} of five counts of wire fraud, two counts of money laundering, and one count of interstate transportation of stolen property. Three of wire fraud counts for which Cochran was convicted were honest services fraud. Cochran's firm, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, served as managing underwriter when the SSM Healthcare System, a non-profit corporation operating several hospitals and nursing homes, issued more than $265 million of tax-exempt bonds; Sakura Global Capital bid $400,000 to provide SSM with a forward supply contract. However, SGC subsequently made a secret payment of $100,000 to Cochran's firm over the course of three wire transmissions; thus, Cochran supposedly deprived SSM and its bondholders of his honest services. The appellate court reversed his conviction, deciding that the government did not provide sufficient evidence that Cochran had actually defrauded SSM or its bondholders of his honest services, applying the [...] "materiality" [...] test:Though Stifel misrepresented that SGC would not pay an additional fee to Stifel for the forward supply contract, this information resulted in no actual or potential harm to SSM. ... No evidence independent of the alleged scheme suggests in any way that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cochran</b> sought to harm SSM or its bondholders. Moreover, we know not from this record how SSM would have changed its conduct had the disclosure been made.|$|E
50|$|The {{community}} was first {{settled in the}} early 1850s. In 1842, Thomas Keenan, Isaac B. Webb, and William Cochran received original land grants in the area. By 1843, a community called Mustang Branch had been established. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cochran</b> later changed the name to Farmers Branch to reflect the area's rich soil and farmland. Farmers Branch was the first location of the Texan Land and Emigration Company (or Peters Colony) in 1845. This made the community {{one of the best-known}} places in Dallas County during the 1840s because of its advertising throughout Europe and the United States. Baptist minister William Bowles opened a blacksmith shop and gristmill in 1845. On May 5, 1845, Isaac B. Webb donated land for Webb's Chapel Methodist Church, the first formal place of worship in Dallas County. A school was established in the church one year later. Webb became the first postmaster at the Farmers Branch post office, which opened on January 5, 1848. It continued to function until its closure in 1866. The post office reopened in 1875. To assure that railroads would eventually pass through Farmers Branch, prominent early settler Samuel Gilbert and others sold right-of-way through their land in 1874. Around three to four years later, the Dallas and Wichita Railway completed a track from Dallas - through Farmers Branch - to Lewisville. It was absorbed by the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad in 1881. The community had a population of approximately 100 by 1890 with several businesses. The population had grown to 300 during the early 1900s. A brick school building was constructed in 1916. The number of people living in the community remained stable until after World War II.|$|E
5000|$|Cochran's, and Delysia's, {{first new}} show {{after the war}} was Afgar by Fred Thompson and Worton David with music by Charles Cuvillier, which opened at the Pavilion in September 1919. It was an extravagant musical comedy set in a Moorish harem, with Delysia as Zaydee, who heads a harem strike leading to general monogamy. Of her performance, The Times said: It is {{difficult}} nowadays to find anything fresh to say about Delysia. She is, and always will be, {{one of the most}} indefatigable workers on the stage. It is impossible for her to keep still, but her restlessness never annoys one. She is so full of life that she is able to inspire her audience with the same feeling, and whether singing or acting she is always giving of her best. As for her costumes … well, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cochran</b> has gone one better than even his previous best in this direction. The sigh of envy from the ladies in the audience as they gazed on these creations of Poiretcould be heard all over the theatre." [...] The show ran in London for 300 performances, after which Delysia sailed to New York at the end of 1920 for the Broadway production at the Central Theatre, for which she was paid £2,500 a week, a prodigious sum at that time. The New York Times thought the show [...] "sufficient-for-the-purpose" [...] as a vehicle for the star, but declared Delysia to be [...] "stunning". After a holiday in France, Delysia returned to North America in August 1921 for a 30-week tour of Afgar. She told The New York Times that these would be her last appearances on the stage, as once the tour was over she was to marry [...] "the best man in the world". It is not known who the man was, and no wedding took place.|$|E
