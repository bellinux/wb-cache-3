25|$|As the {{workplace}} is changing to include more group-based systems, researching motivation within these groups is of growing importance. To date, {{a great amount of}} research has focused on the Job characteristic theory and the Goal-setting Theory. While more research is needed that draws on a broader range of motivation theories, research thus far has concluded several things: (a) semi-autonomous groups report higher levels of job scope (related to intrinsic job satisfaction), extrinsic satisfaction, and organizational commitment; and (b) developmentally mature teams have higher job motivation and innovation. Further, voluntarily formed work teams report high work motivation. Though research shows that appropriate goal-setting influences group motivation and performance, more research is needed in this area (group goals, individual goals, cohesiveness, etc.). There are inseparable <b>mediating</b> <b>variables</b> consisting of group cohesiveness, commitment, and performance. As {{the workplace}} environment calls for more and more teams to be formed, research into motivation of teams is ever-pressing. Thus far, overarching research merely suggests that individual-level and team-level sources of motivation are congruent with each other. Consequently, research should be expanded to apply more theories of motivation; look at group dynamics; and essentially conclude how groups can be most impacted to increase motivation and, consequently, performance.|$|E

Besides, examining indirect effects can lead to a less biased estimation of effects sizes in empirical research (Holbert & Stephenson 2003).

40|$|Background. A {{significant}} proportion of older adults in The Netherlands do not participate regularly in leisure-time physical activity. The Groningen Active Living Model (GALM) was developed to change this situation for the better. Longitudinal results of the validation of the GALM behavioral change model are presented. Methods. We obtained data on potentially <b>mediating</b> <b>variables</b> of physical activity behavior change (self-efficacy, social support, perceived fitness, and enjoyment) from 96 participants in a prospective study during the 18 months the GALM strategy lasted. Results. Prospective analyses revealed significant differences in several potentially <b>mediating</b> <b>variables,</b> although some of these differ-ences were contrary to our hypothesis. Discriminant analysis resulted in canonical correlations of 0. 50 after 6 months and 0. 66 after 18 months of program participation between adherers and nonadherers, respectively; 73. 8 and 80. 0 % of the subjects were classified correctly. Conclusions. Based on the results, {{it can be concluded}} that we partially succeeded in manipulating the potentially <b>mediating</b> <b>variables</b> by means of our GALM strategy. Several <b>mediating</b> <b>variables</b> were identified that reliably discriminated long-term adherers from nonadherers, expanding the generalizability of social cognitive theory-driven variables to a Dutch population...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{importance}} {{of the relationship between}} an institution and its constituents is examined through establishing a model of exchange relationship’s three key important constructs (satisfaction, trust and commitment), which is adopted from the Customer Relationship Marketing/Management (CRM) concept. These three key constructs have been viewed as essential ingredients for successful long-term relationship in private sector CRM. The model is tested using data from the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) of Singapore. It is then compared with a rival model that does not have satisfaction, trust and commitment as <b>mediating</b> <b>variables.</b> The result shows that the model with the three key constructs as <b>mediating</b> <b>variables</b> is better. Understanding the impact of the <b>mediating</b> <b>variables</b> on outcome behaviours can lead to more participation and survival of the institution.

40|$|AbstractThe major {{purpose of}} this article is to expand the domain of the {{business}} research by providing conceptual analysis of the moderating and <b>mediating</b> <b>variables</b> and exploring their potent effects in business research. To provide specific implications, Kang et al. (2015) model with respect to Balanced Scorecard technique is conceptually extended. Theoretical foundation of the moderating, mediating, and their major distinctions along with appropriate statistical tests applicable to each situation are also provided. The model is also extended to analyzing interaction effects of Mediated-Moderation and Moderated-Mediation designs and their testing. The article concludes that: 1) the nature of complex business problems will be more transparently captured by considering moderating and <b>mediating</b> <b>variables,</b> 2) without specifying moderating and <b>mediating</b> <b>variables,</b> business models are incomplete and therefore are not able to solve real business obstacles. Lack of inclusion of moderating and mediating effects is one viable reason which indicates why most business models do not function in real practice, 3) moderating and <b>mediating</b> <b>variables</b> are widening the scope of the prevalent business theories, and 4) moderating and moderating variables makes it possible to respond to the inquiries regarding “when” “how” and “why” a particular relationship exists between the independent and dependent variables.
