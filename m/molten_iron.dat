Water-powered bellows at Semogo in northern Italy in 1226 in a two-stage process. In this, the <b>molten</b> <b>iron</b> was tapped {{twice a day}} into water thereby granulating it.|$|E
5|$|The hot carbon {{monoxide}} is the reducing {{agent for the}} iron ore and reacts with the iron oxide to produce <b>molten</b> <b>iron</b> and carbon dioxide. Depending on {{the temperature in the}} different parts of the furnace (warmest at the bottom) the iron is reduced in several steps. At the top, where the temperature usually is in the range between 200°C and 700°C, the iron oxide is partially reduced to iron(II,III) oxide, Fe3O4.|$|E
5|$|The slag melts in {{the heat}} of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser <b>molten</b> <b>iron,</b> and {{apertures}} in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron, once cooled, is called pig iron, while the slag can be used as a material in road construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for agriculture.|$|E
50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} is {{a primary}} steelmaking process for converting the <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> into steel by blowing oxygen through a lance over the <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> inside the converter. Exothermic heat is generated by the oxidation reactions during blowing.|$|R
40|$|The {{interfacial}} phenomena between <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> and ilmenite prereduced {{with carbon}} and hydrogen were investigated. The wettability of prereduced ilmenite discs by <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> was evaluated through measuring contact angle by the sessile droplet method. The effects of melting temperature, prereduction temperature and reduction degree on contact angle were examined. <b>Molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> {{could not be}} wetted by ilmenite prereduced with carbon and hydrogen, and the contact angle increases with increasing prereduction temperature. The contact angles of ilmenite prereduced with hydrogen are {{higher than that of}} ilmenite prereduced with carbon at the same reduction degree. The permeation of <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> into porous ilmenite was observed at the interface of specimens prereduced with carbon and enhanced at higher reduction temperature. On the other hand, in the case of ilmenite prereduced with hydrogen, the permeation was not observed. These results indicate clearly that the separation between <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> and reduced ilmenite can be enhanced by hydrogen reduction process, even at lower temperature than that of carbon reduction process...|$|R

5|$|With over 400 active volcanos, Io is {{the most}} geologically active object in the Solar System. Its surface is dotted with more than 100 mountains, {{some of which are}} taller than Earth's Mount Everest. Unlike most {{satellites}} in the outer Solar System (which have a thick coating of ice), Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a <b>molten</b> <b>iron</b> or iron sulfide core.|$|E
5|$|The {{motion of}} the fluid is {{sustained}} by convection, motion driven by buoyancy. The temperature increases towards {{the center of the}} Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the <b>molten</b> <b>iron</b> solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called compositional convection. A Coriolis effect, caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north-south polar axis.|$|E
5|$|The {{strengthening}} {{effect of}} forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries {{and the strong}} increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The high-speed tool steels contain between 3 and 5% chromium. Stainless steel, the main corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when chromium is added to iron in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium {{is added to the}} <b>molten</b> <b>iron.</b> Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, Inconel 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel superalloys, they are used in jet engines and gas turbines in lieu of common structural materials.|$|E
25|$|Although {{steel is}} an alloy {{of iron and}} {{a small amount of}} carbon, {{historically}} steel and iron-making were intended for different products given the high costs of steel over wrought iron. The main difficulty with making steel is that its higher melting point than pig or cast iron was not easily achievable in large-scale production until methods that introduced air or oxygen to oxidize the carbon in the <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> were developed, allowing the direct conversion of <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> to <b>molten</b> steel.|$|R
50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} (BOS, BOP, BOF, and OSM), {{also known}} as Linz-Donawitz-steelmaking or the oxygen converter process is a method of primary steelmaking in which carbon-rich <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> is made into steel. Blowing oxygen through <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> lowers the carbon content of the alloy and changes it into low-carbon steel. The process is known as basic because fluxes of burnt lime or dolomite, which are chemical bases, are added to promote the removal of impurities and protect {{the lining of the}} converter.|$|R
2500|$|By 1913, 80% {{of steel}} {{was being made}} from <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> {{directly}} from the blast furnace, eliminating the step of casting the [...] "pigs" [...] (ingots) and remelting.|$|R
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, {{also known}} as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65microteslas (0.25 to 0.65gauss). Roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle {{at the center of the}} Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. Unlike a bar magnet, Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion of <b>molten</b> <b>iron</b> alloys in its outer core).|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field, like Earth's, {{is generated}} by an internal dynamo supported by the circulation of a conducting fluid in its outer core. But whereas Earth's core is made of <b>molten</b> <b>iron</b> and nickel, Jupiter's is composed of metallic hydrogen. As with Earth's, Jupiter's magnetic field is mostly a dipole, with north and south magnetic poles {{at the ends of}} a single magnetic axis. However, on Jupiter the north pole of the dipole is located in the planet's northern hemisphere and the south pole of the dipole lies in its southern hemisphere, opposite to the Earth, whose north pole lies in the southern hemisphere and south pole lies in the northern hemisphere. Jupiter's field also has quadrupole, octupole and higher components, though they are less than one tenth as strong as the dipole component.|$|E
25|$|Following {{laboratory}} tests of <b>molten</b> <b>iron,</b> European scientists {{determine that the}} Earth's core has a temperature of 6,000 degrees Celsius, 1,000 degrees hotter than previously thought. This discovery {{may help explain why}} the planet has such a strong geomagnetic field.|$|E

50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} is {{a method}} of primary steelmaking in which carbon-rich <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> is made into steel. Blowing oxygen through <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> lowers the carbon content of the alloy and changes it into steel. The process is known as basic due to the chemical nature of the refractories—calcium oxide and magnesium oxide—that line the vessel to withstand the high temperature and corrosive nature of the molten metal and slag in the vessel. The slag chemistry of the process is also controlled to ensure that impurities such as silicon and phosphorus are removed from the metal.|$|R
2500|$|In 1742, Grubb {{replaced}} his bloomery with a [...] high charcoal-fired {{cold blast}} furnace. The blast furnace burned hotter than the bloomery {{and was able}} to render <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> ("charcoal iron") from the ore.|$|R
25|$|The metal gloves of Grim Tuesday {{may be a}} {{reference}} to Járngreipr, a pair of metal gloves that Thor used in Norse mythology. This is made more likely {{by the fact that}} Thor used them to catch balls of <b>molten</b> <b>iron,</b> and Arthur and Grim Tuesday used them to catch floating gobbets of Nothing.|$|E
25|$|Cutting is {{initiated}} by heating the edge or leading face (as in cutting shapes such as round rod) {{of the steel}} to the ignition temperature (approximately bright cherry red heat) using the pre-heat jets only, then using the separate cutting oxygen valve to release the oxygen from the central jet. The oxygen chemically combines with the iron in the ferrous material to oxidize the iron quickly into <b>molten</b> <b>iron</b> oxide, producing the cut. Initiating {{a cut in the}} middle of a workpiece is known as piercing.|$|E
25|$|A {{high-quality}} {{flake graphite}} product that closely resembles natural flake graphite {{can be made}} from steelmaking kish. Kish is a large-volume near-molten waste skimmed from the <b>molten</b> <b>iron</b> feed to a basic oxygen furnace, and consists of a mix of graphite (precipitated out of the supersaturated iron), lime-rich slag, and some iron. The iron is recycled on site, leaving a mixture of graphite and slag. The best recovery process uses hydraulic classification (which utilizes a flow of water to separate minerals by specific gravity: graphite is light and settles nearly last) to get a 70% graphite rough concentrate. Leaching this concentrate with hydrochloric acid gives a 95% graphite product with a flake size ranging from 10 mesh down.|$|E

5000|$|The Le Creuset {{signature}} color, Flame (orange), {{was born}} in this first piece. With their new ability to pigment the enamel glaze, Desaegher and Aubecq modeled their first color after the intense orange hue of <b>molten</b> cast <b>iron</b> inside a cauldron ("creuset" [...] in French).|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{continuous}} flow processes is the blast furnace for producing pig iron. The blast furnace is intermittently charged with ore, fuel and flux and intermittently tapped for <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> and slag; however, the chemical reaction {{of reducing the}} iron and silicon and later oxidizing the silicon is continuous.|$|R
25|$|Elemental silicon {{is added}} to molten cast iron as {{ferrosilicon}} or silicocalcium alloys to improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation of cementite where exposed to outside air. The presence of elemental silicon in <b>molten</b> <b>iron</b> acts as a sink for oxygen, so that the steel carbon content, which must be kept within narrow limits {{for each type of}} steel, can be more closely controlled. Ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of the steel industry, and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure, it accounts for 80% of the world's use of free silicon. Silicon is an important constituent of electrical steel, modifying its resistivity and ferromagnetic properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} mass-producing cheap steel was solved in 1855 by Henry Bessemer, with the {{introduction}} of the Bessemer converter at his steelworks in Sheffield, England. (An early converter can still be seen at the city's Kelham Island Museum). In the Bessemer process, molten pig iron from the blast furnace was charged into a large crucible, and then air was blown through the <b>molten</b> <b>iron</b> from below, igniting the dissolved carbon from the coke. As the carbon burned off, the melting point of the mixture increased, but the heat from the burning carbon provided the extra energy needed to keep the mixture molten. After the carbon content in the melt had dropped to the desired level, the air draft was cut off: a typical Bessemer converter could convert a 25-ton batch of pig iron to steel in half an hour.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries, the English {{steelmakers}} produced blister and crucible steel which required specialized equipment like finery forges and puddling furnaces and cost over £50 per long ton. In the 18th century, innovations like steamboats, railroads, and guns {{increased demand for}} wrought iron and steel. The Mount Savage Iron Works in Maryland was {{the largest in the}} United States in the late 1840s, and the first in the nation to produce heavy rails for the construction of railroads. In the 1850s, American William Kelly and Englishman Henry Bessemer independently discovered that air blown through the <b>molten</b> <b>iron</b> increases its temperature by oxidizing the carbon and separating additional impurities into the slag. The Kelly-Bessemer process, because it reduces the amount of coke needed for blasting and increases the quality of the finished iron, revolutionized the mass production of high-quality steel and facilitated a drastic drop in steel prices and expansion of its availability.|$|E
5000|$|Cast iron is {{sometimes}} melted {{in a special}} type of blast furnace known as a cupola, but in modern applications, it is more often melted in electric induction furnaces or electric arc furnaces. [...] After melting is complete, the <b>molten</b> cast <b>iron</b> is poured into a holding furnace or ladle.|$|R
50|$|A {{steel mill}} or {{steelworks}} is an industrial plant for {{the manufacture of}} steel. It may be an integrated steel works carrying out all steps of steelmaking from smelting iron ore to rolled product, but may also describe plants where steel semi-finished casting products (blooms, ingots, slabs, billets) are made, from <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron</b> or from scrap.|$|R
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces silica {{which has}} {{to be removed from}} the pig iron. The silica is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats {{to the surface of the}} <b>molten</b> pig <b>iron.</b> The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, the Trow {{put down}} the Oghre rebellion, and vow to attack Llancarfan. On the way to {{intercept}} them, Connacht's forces are ambushed by Bahl'al, and although they survive, Connacht knows someone has betrayed them. Eventually, they destroy the Trow Empire, Connacht using the SunHammer to melt their cities and trap them within the <b>molten</b> <b>iron.</b> Upon returning to Llancarfan, Connacht prepares the army to destroy Moagim. Before they leave, however, Leitrim asks Connacht to let him command the attack. Despite his misgivings, and under pressure from Mjarin, Connacht agrees. En route, they are attacked by Bahl'al, but Myrdred, {{who seems to have}} grown unnaturally skilled, defeats him in a dream duel. Meanwhile, Moagim heads west, planning to cross the Cloudspine Mountains into The Province. With both sides camped in the Cloudspine, Moagim sneaks into the Llancarfan camp and kills Leitrim. Connacht and Damas then lead an assault into Moagim's camp, with Connacht killing Moagim, and his armies of undead collapsing thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The {{period between}} 1000 BC and 500 AD is {{referred}} to as the Megalithic Culture in South India and is similar to the culture in Africa and Europe. In January 2009, the Department of Archaeology discovered a Megalithic age cist burial ground at Thazhuthala in Kollam Metropolitan Area, which had thrown lights to the past glory and ancient human settlements in Kollam area. Similar cists had been earlier discovered from the south east of Kollam. The team discovered three burial chambers, iron weapons, earthen vessels in black and red and remains of <b>molten</b> <b>iron</b> after their first major excavation in Kollam. They found a cairn circle in 1990 during their first major excavation. In August 2009, a team of archaeologists led by Dr P.Rajendran, UGC research scientist and archaeologist at the Department of History of Kerala University, had discovered Lower Paleolithic tools along with the Chinese coins and potteries from the seabed of Tangasseri in the city. This is for the first time that prehistoric cupules and Lower Paleolithic tools were discovered from below the seabed in India. These tools prove that the Stone Age people lived in present Kollam area and surroundings had moved to the coastal areas during the glacial period in the Pleistocene, when the sea-level was almost 300 feet below the present sea-level. Those tools are made of chert and quartzite rocks.|$|E
25|$|Gwon {{and his men}} set up camp in the {{run-down}} {{fortress of}} Haengju (행주산성; 幸州山城) near Seoul. Although his forces were joined by local militias led by Kim Chun-il and monk soldiers led by Cheo Yung, his entire unit in Haengju {{was no more than}} 2,800 men. Threatened by this action, Japanese commanders Kato Kiyomasa (加藤清正) and Ukita, attacked Haengju fortress with 30,000 men, trying to finish off Gwon's troops once and for all. Ukita, who never led the attack in the frontline directly, led the Japanese toward the fortress. The Battle of Haengju commenced early in the morning of 12 February 1593. Japanese troops under Kato and Ukita, armed with muskets, surrounded the fortress and launched several massive attacks. However, Gwon's forces and the civilians at the fortress resisted heavily, throwing rocks, arrows, iron pellets, burning oil and <b>molten</b> <b>iron</b> at the Japanese. Korean anti-personnel gunpowder weapons called hwachas (화차; 火車) and explosive cannon shells called bigyeokjincheolloi (비격진천뢰; 飛擊震天雷) were also utilized in this battle. The Japanese, with over 10,000 casualties and top generals Ukita, Ishida Mitsunari, and Kikkawa Hiroie wounded, were compelled to retreat and fled the region. It was one of the three greatest Korean military victories during the Seven-Year War, along with the Battle of Hansan Island (한산대첩) and the Siege of Jinju (진주대첩).|$|E
2500|$|The {{inexpensive}} {{process for}} making good quality wrought iron was puddling, which became widespread after 1800.
