50|$|Prunus cerasifera is {{a species}} of plum known by the common names cherry plum and <b>myrobalan</b> <b>plum.</b> It is native to Southeast Europe and Western Asia, and is naturalised in the British Isles and {{scattered}} locations in North America.|$|E
50|$|Their methods involve guiding a tree's growth along {{predetermined}} wired design pathways over {{a period}} of time. They shape growing trees both for living outdoor art and for intentional harvest. They most often use <b>Myrobalan</b> <b>Plum</b> for shaping. Examples of their functional artwork include a growing garden table, a harvested coffee table, hat stands, mirrors, and a gemstone neck piece.|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of softwood cuttings of <b>Myrobalan</b> <b>plum</b> infested after 50 and 105 days with 3, 000 second-stage juveniles (J 2) of Meloidogyne arenaria {{was compared to}} 15 -month-old hardwood cuttings in 13 genotypes ranging from highly resistant to susceptible. Gall index and number of galls were recorded 30 days after infestation. Fifty-day-old cuttings rooted in perlite developed many rootlets, but had only incipient galls after infestation. In sand, rooting of 50 -day-old cuttings not treated with indolebutyric acid (IBA) hormone was so variable that their resistance could not be assessed. Similar cuttings rooted with IBA developed more galls, but neither number of galls per plant nor gall index was a reliable criterion for determination of host suitability. Because of the better rooting results with IBA treatment, 105 -day-old cuttings were first rooted with IBA in perlite and then transferred into sand for nematode inoculation. Known highly resistant genotypes of <b>Myrobalan</b> <b>plum</b> were gall-free and the responses of other genotypes paralleled that of the reference hardwood cuttings, although the test was less discriminating. Expression of M. arenaria host suitability in <b>Myrobalan</b> <b>plum</b> depends on root tissue maturation and cannot be reliably evaluated with 50 -day-old cuttings...|$|E
40|$|Stone fruits (Prunus spp.) {{are mainly}} grown in Mediterranean climates. The {{objective}} of a rootstock breeding {{program is to}} obtain a new 2 and 3 -way rootstock generation, not only resistant to RKN nematodes, but also better adapted to Mediterranean environments that exhibit abiotic stresses (drought, chlorosis and waterlogging). This {{was done by the}} characterization of new interspecific material between nematode resistant <b>Myrobalan</b> <b>plums,</b> P. cerasifera (P. 2980 and P. 2175) and the peach (P. persica) × almond (P. amygdalus) hybrids: GN 15 (‘Garnem’) and GN 22 (‘Felinem’). The first data on the characterization of this plant material has revealed that tolerance to waterlogging and propagation ability, characteristics of the Myrobalan parent, have been inherited to a satisfactory level. Characterization for drought and chlorosis tolerance has also shown a satisfactory level of inheritance from the almond parent and from the almond × peach hybrids GxN. The plant material already characterized is the basis for new approaches to better understand the mechanism of tolerance to abiotic stresses...|$|R

40|$|Responses of 17 Prunus {{rootstocks}} or accessions (11 {{from the}} subgenus Amygdalus and 6 from the subgenus Prunophora) were evaluated against 11 isolates of Meloidogyne spp. including one M. arenaria, four M. incognita, four M. javanica, one M. hispanica, and an unclassified population from Florida. Characterization of plant response to root-knot nematodes {{was based on}} a gall index rating. Numbers of females and juveniles plus eggs in the roots were determined for 10 of the rootstocks evaluated against one M. arenaria, one M. incognita, one M. javanica, and the Florida isolate. These 10 rootstocks plus Nemaguard and Nemared were retested by growing three different rootstock genotypes together in containers of soil infested individually with each of the above four isolates. Garfi and Garrigues almonds, GF. 305 and Rutgers Red Leaf peaches, and the peach-almond GF. 677 were susceptible to all isolates. Differences in resistance were detected among the other rootstocks of the subgenus Amygdalus. The peach-almond GF. 557 and Summergrand peach were resistant to M. arenaria and M. incognita but susceptible to M. javanica and the Florida isolate. Nemaguard, Nemared, and its two hybrids G x N no. 15 and G x N no. 22 were resistant to all but the Florida isolate. In the subgenus Prunophora, <b>Myrobalan</b> <b>plums</b> P. 1079, P. 2175, P. 2980, and P. 2984; Marianna plum 29 C; and P. insititia plum AD. 101 were resistant to all isolates. Thus, two different genetic systems of RKN resistance were found in the subgenus Amygdalus: one system acting against M. arenaria and M. incognita, and another system also acting against M. javanica. Prunophora rootstocks bear a complete genetic system for resistance also acting against the Florida isolate. The hypotheses on the relationships between these systems and the corresponding putative genes of resistance are presented...|$|R

40|$|A {{rootstock}} {{breeding programme}} for apricot {{is being developed}} through interspecific crosses of the <b>Myrobalan</b> <b>plum</b> (Prunus cerasifera Ehrh.) and the 'Moniqui' and 'Moniqui Borde' (P. armeniaca L.) apricot cultivars. In this work, the incidence of accidental pollinations on these low-setting hybridisations was assessed. The progeny originated through hand-pollination of emasculated flowers of three Myrobalan clones, in three consecutive years. Fruit set was low and variable among years (1. 8 - 8. 0 %), but higher than the level of accidental pollination measured with emasculated and non-pollinated flowers (1. 2 %). The molecular characterisation of the progeny was performed with three SSR markers. The results show that, from the 278 genotypes evaluated, 73 appeared to be hybrids and 205 did not. The procedure to obtain hybrid plants is discussed here {{in terms of the}} loss of hybrid clones along the process from pollination to field cultivation. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Breeding Prunus {{rootstocks}} {{with high}} root-knot nematode (RKN) resistance, good adaptation to chlorosis, water-logging and drought with graft compatibility with peach and rooting ability {{will be crucial}} to achieving sustainable fruit production in the Mediterranean area. This may be possible by combining resistance or tolerance traits from almond (chlorosis and drought), plum (RKN, water-logging and rooting ability), and peach (RKN, graft compatibility). The breeding strategy for RKN resistance {{is based upon the}} selection and pyramiding of major genes conferring a high-level, wide-spectrum and heat-stable resistance. Screening among Prunus species and accessions for appropriate resistance sources was carried out during a first EU project (1993 - 1997). Some <b>Myrobalan</b> (M) <b>plum</b> accessions were characterized as resistant to all RKN species, even under high and continuous inoculum pressure and high temperatures. This resistance is attributed to a single major gene, Ma. By contrast, peach (P) and almond (A) sources express a near-complete or incomplete spectrum of resistance. In a second EU project (1999 - 2003), breeding {{for a new generation of}} interspecific rootstocks, of the type M x P, M x A and M x (P x A), based on the pyramiding of Ma with other resistance (R) genes from peach (RMia) or almond was developed for Prunus species. This paper reports on the progress of this 2 nd EU project. To develop marker-assisted selection (MAS), R genes are being mapped using SSR markers from a European reference Prunus map and a BSA approach. Ma and at least one peach gene (RMia) were located on linkage groups 7 and 2, respectively, of the reference map with various SSR loci nearby. Several SCAR markers located less than 1 cM on each side of or co-segregating with Ma are available for MAS of all interspecific crosses. Development of high-resolution genetic and physical maps of the Ma gene have been performed on over 1300 segregating individuals. In peach, one SCAR marker obtained by Yamamoto and Hayashi (2002) for a RKN resistant Japanese cultivar fell less than 5 cM from the RMia gene. The agronomic evaluation is in progress with special attention to chlorosis, drought, and water-logging tolerance. Interspecific hybrids M x P, M x A and M x (P x A) have a higher level of water-logging tolerance compared to reference Amygdalus rootstocks such as GF 677, GN 15 and GN 22...|$|R
40|$|Symptoms of sharka disease {{were first}} {{observed}} on plums in Chrudim district, Central Bohemia, in former Czechoslovakia {{in the forties}} of the last century. Plum pox virus (PPV) was first detected in the Bohemian part of Czechoslovakia in 1952 (SMOLÁK, NOVÁK 1956). An investigation into the diversity and distribution of natural sources of PPV in the Czech Republic began in 1995. Partial results were published by POLÁK (1997) and POLÁK and PÍVALOVÁ (2001) for the years 1999 – 2001. The results of distribution of PPV in naturally growing <b>plum</b> trees, <b>myrobalans</b> and blackthorns were presented completely in 2002 (POLÁK 2002). A small percentage of isolates of the PPV-M serotype in the Czech Republic was found by NAVRÁTIL et al. (1997). They identified it from different, not in greater detail characterised hosts, genetic resources, and experi-mental plants of institutions. The occurrence of PPV-M strain was investigated in our laboratory from 1999 to 2001 at various localities in naturally growing <b>plums,</b> <b>myrobalans</b> and blackthorns. 78 plum and damson trees, 32 myrobalans, and 8 blackthorns were investigated. By means of Mabs, PPV-M was detected only in two plum trees and one damson tree (POLÁK 2002). Furthermore, the presence of PPV-M strain was investigated in se-lected peach and apricot orchards. MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant material The incidence and distribution of PPV-M strain were investigated in two selected intensive orchards of ap-ricots and peaches in Southern Moravia and Central Bohemia.

40|$|Root-knot {{nematodes}} (RKNs) [i]Meloidogyne[/i] spp. cause major {{damage to}} cultivated woody plants. Among them, Prunus, grapevine and coffee are the crops most infested by worldwide polyphagous species and species {{with a more}} limited distribution and/or narrower host range. The identification and characterization of natural sources of resistance are important steps to develop RKN control strategies. In woody crops, resistant rootstocks genetically different from the scion of agronomical interest may be engineered. We describe herein the interactions between RKNs and different woody crops, and highlight the plant species in which resistance and corresponding resistance (R) genes have been discovered. Even though grapevine and, to a lesser extent, coffee {{have a history of}} rootstock selection for RKN resistance, few cases of resistance have been documented. By contrast, in [i]Prunus[/i], R genes with different spectra have been mapped in plums, peach and almond and can be pyramided for durable resistance in interspecific rootstocks. We particularly discuss here the Ma Toll/interleukin- 1 receptor-like-nucleotide binding-leucine-rich repeat gene from <b>Myrobalan</b> <b>plum,</b> one of the longest plant R genes cloned to date, due to its unique biological and structural properties.

40|$|Resistant {{rootstocks}} {{offer an}} alternative to pesticides for the control of soil pests. In Prunus spp., resistance loci to root-knot nematodes (RKN) have been mapped and a transformation method is needed to validate candidate genes. Our efforts {{have focused on the}} generation of transformed hairy-roots and composite plants appropriate for nematode infection assays. An efficient and reliable method using the A 4 R strain of Agrobacterium rhizogenes for the transformation of Prunus roots with an Egfp reporter gene is given. The rooting efficiency, depending on the genotypes, was maximal for the interspecific hybrid 253 (<b>Myrobalan</b> <b>plum</b> × almond-peach), susceptible to RKN, that was retained for subsequent studies. From the agro-inoculated cuttings, 72 % produced roots, mainly at the basal section of the stem. Transformed roots were screened by microscope detection of Egfp fluorescence and molecular analyses of the integration of the transgene. The absence of residual agrobacteria in the plants was checked by the non-amplification of the chromosomal gene chvH. Egfp was expressed visually in 76 % of the rooted plants. Isolated hairy roots in Petri dishes and composite plants (transformed roots and non-transformed aerial part) in soil containers were inoculated with the RKN Meloidogyne incognita. In both cases, root transformation did not affect the ability of the nematodes to develop in the root tissues. Our results showed that isolated hairy-roots can be used to validate candidate genes and the conditions in which composite plants offer a complementary system for studying the function of root genes in physiological conditions of whole plants are discussed.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] microsatellite primer pairs, previously developed in peach, {{were used to}} characterize and to explore genetic relationships among 44 clones, representing three groups of rootstocks defined as: (1) Peach-based rootstocks (Prunus dulcis x P. persica, P. persica x P. davidiana); (2) <b>Myrobalan</b> - Marianna <b>plums</b> (P. cerasifera, and interspecific hybrids having P. cerasifera as a parent); and (3) Slow growing plums (P. insititia, P. domestica, and P. domestica x P. spinosa). Eighteen SSR markers, from the 20 initially used, were able to amplify polymorphic products for the Peach-based rootstocks and 13 common markers gave also polymorphism for the Myrobalan-Marianna and Slow growing plums groups. The Dice coefficient of similarity was calculated between all pairs of accessions and their genetic similarity represented by a principal coordinate analysis. The genetic diversity detected among the 44 clones studied divided them in three groups, which are in agreement with their current taxonomic classification and their morphological characteristics. A set of three microsatellites (BPPCT 001, CPPCT 022 and UDP 98 - 407) can distinguish between all the clones analyzed. The analysis within groups reveal another two sets of three SSR {{to distinguish between the}} clones from the peach based rootstocks and the myrobalan-Marianna plums respectively and only a single SSR is needed to distinguish within the clones from the Slow growing plums group. These results demonstrate the high potential of the SSR analysis for peach rootstock identification and studies of diversity in Prunus species.

40|$|Neste estudo, foram analisadas as mudanças sazonais do teor de Na nos ramos, botões florais e flores, bem como no peso dos frutos e na produtividade de duas cultivares de ameixeiras européias (‘Cacanska lepotica’ e ‘Cacanska najbolja’) enxertadas sobre os porta-enxertos Myrobalan (Prunus cerasifera Ehch.) e Stanley, aos 6 - 8 anos após o plantio em solo ácido areno-argiloso. O conteúdo de Na nos ramos e nos botões florais para cada combinação de copa/porta-enxerto teve a variação durante a temporada e o maior teor foi constatado em maio e agôsto, respectivamente. A influência do porta-enxerto sobre os parâmetros estudados foi variável devido à forte interação copa/porta-enxerto/ano. Os ramos e botãos florais das plantas enxertadas sobre os porta-enxerto Stanley e Myrobalan, tiveram o maior e o menor teor de Na, respectivamente; enquanto o maior teor de Na nas flores foi registrado na ‘Cacanska lepotica’ sobre o porta-enxerto Myrobalan. O conteúdo de Na nos órgãos de ameixa teve a seguinte evolução: ramos de 1 ano > ramos de 2 anos > botões florai > flores. Não houve correlação significativa entre os órgãos da ameixeira em termos de teor de Na. A Análise de Componentes Principais mostrou que o porta-enxerto Stanley teve uma capacidade maior de armazenamento e distribuição de Na do que o porta-enxerto Myrobalan nas plantas. O teor de Na nos órgãos da ameixeira e o solo ácido não afectaram negativamente o peso dos frutos e a produção das variedades de ameixas, que tiveram resultados positivos. In {{the present}} study, the {{seasonal}} changes of Na content of shoots, flower buds and flowers, and fruit weight and yield of two European plum cultivars (‘Cacanska Lepotica’ and ‘Cacanska Najbolja’) budded on Myrobalan (Prunus cerasifera Ehrh.) and Stanley rootstocks were analyzed after 6 - 8 years of planting on acidic sandy-loam soil. The Na {{content of the}} shoots and flower buds of each rootstock/cultivar combination varied during season, and the highest content in above organs was observed in May and August, respectively. The effect of rootstocks on the examined parameters was variable due to the strong rootstock/cultivar/year interaction observed. The shoots and flower buds of cultivars budded on Stanley and Myrobalan rootstocks gave the highest and lowest Na content, respectively, whereas the highest Na content in flowers registered in ‘Cacanska Lepotica’ on Myrobalan. The content of Na in the plum organs suggests the following trends: 1 -year old shoots > 2 -year-old shoots > flower buds > flowers. There were no statistically significant correlations among plum organs with respect to Na content. The Principal Component Analysis showed that Stanley rootstock had a higher Na accumulation and distribution capacity than <b>Myrobalan</b> rootstock in <b>plum</b> trees.

40|$|The European Commission {{requested}} the EFSA Panel on Plant Health {{to perform the}} pest categorisation for Pseudomonas syringae pv. persicae (P. s. pv. persicae). The agent is responsible for bacterial die-back in peach, nectarine, Japanese plum and, possibly, <b>myrobalan</b> <b>plum.</b> The disease {{is caused by a}} genetic clade within genomic species 3 of P. syringae, but there is only limited knowledge of the diversity of the causative agent. The host plants are cultivated throughout Europe, although it is only in southern European countries that the production of peaches and/or nectarines is of economic importance, and the cultivation of Japanese plums is restricted to some parts of southern Europe. Outbreaks are rare and currently the disease occurs only sporadically in Portugal, France and Germany. P. s. pv. persicae causes symptoms on the bark, shoots, leaves and fruit. Detection is based on symptomatology and isolation; no DNA amplification (polymerase chain reaction) protocols are available. The pathogen can be identified on the basis of disease symptoms, including shoot die-back and leaf spots, and on the basis of distinct biochemical and genetic properties. No effective management strategies are available, although disease incidence and severity can be somewhat reduced by disinfection of tools, machines and materials, the use of planting material from disease-free areas, and the avoidance of conditions favouring disease expression. Initial infections {{may be due to the}} use of (latently) infected plant material, but infections may also occur from the environment.

40|$|The Ma gene from <b>Myrobalan</b> <b>plum</b> is a TNL {{gene that}} confers a {{high-level}} resistance to all root-knot nematodes of major economic importance, including Meloidogyne incognita, M. javanica, M. arenaria, and M. enterolobii. The nematode {{behavior in the}} roots and the corresponding histological mechanisms of the Ma resistance to M. incognita in the resistant (R) accessions of the plum 'P. 2175 ' and the interspecific hybrid P. 2175 x almond-peach ' 35 ', carrying the Mal allele (Ma 1 /ma), were characterized {{in comparison with the}} susceptible (S) accessions in the plum 'P. 2032 ' and the interspecific hybrid P. 2175 x almond-peach ' 253 ' (ma/ma). Second-stage juveniles (J 2 s) were inoculated in micropropagated plantlets grown in soil substrate under controlled conditions at 25 degrees C. Nematodes penetrated both R and S plants preferentially along the apical zone or close to the young lateral buds and moved via similar routes. Then they migrated into the cortex downward {{in the direction of the}} apex and turned up in the meristematic apical region to colonize the differentiating stele. In R accessions, motile J 2 s neither swelled nor developed into J 3 s, and initiation of feeding sites was never observed. This complete absence of gall symptoms is associated with cell necroses and corresponding hypersensitive-like reaction (HLR) phenotypes occurring either in the stele or in the meristematic apical region or in the cortex. Nematode attacks often disorganized the meristematic apical tissues of R accessions, which induced the development of subterminal lateral roots replacing primary terminal apices and, thus, provided an active resistance reaction to HLR damage...|$|E
40|$|Root-knot {{nematode}} (RKN) Meloidogyne {{species are}} major polyphagous pests of most crops worldwide, and cultivars with durable resistance are urgently needed because of nematicide bans.

We report here the positional cloning and the functional validation of the Ma locus present at the heterozygous state in the P. 2175 accession. High-resolution mapping totaling over 3, 000 segregants reduced the Ma locus interval to a 32 -kb cluster of three Toll/Interleukin 1 Receptor-Nucleotide Binding Site-Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR) genes (TNL 1 –TNL 3), including a pseudogene (TNL 2) and a truncated gene (TNL 3). The sole complete gene in this interval (TNL 1) was validated as Ma, as it conferred the same complete-spectrum and high-level resistance (as in P. 2175) using its genomic sequence and native promoter region in Agrobacterium rhizogenes-transformed hairy roots and composite plants. The full-length cDNA (2, 048 amino acids) of Ma is the longest of all Resistance genes cloned to date. Its TNL structure is completed by a huge post-LRR (PL) sequence (1, 088 amino acids) comprising five repeated carboxyl-terminal PL exons with two conserved motifs. The amino-terminal region (213 amino acids) of the LRR exon is conserved between alleles and contrasts with the high interallelic polymorphisms of its distal region (111 amino acids) and of PL domains.
