50|$|Under {{appropriate}} conditions, each shoot meristem {{can develop}} into a complete new plant or clone. Such new plants can be grown from shoot cuttings that contain an apical meristem. Root apical meristems are not readily cloned, however. This cloning is called asexual reproduction or vegetative reproduction and is widely practiced in horticulture to mass-produce plants of a desirable genotype. This process {{is also known as}} <b>mericloning.</b>|$|E
40|$|A <b>mericloning</b> {{protocol}} {{that enables}} shoot multiplication and rooting of Paphiopedilum orchids in one step {{or in the}} same medium was developed by systematically assessing and modifying the nutrient supplements employed earlier for shoot proliferation by Huang [Am. Orchid Soc. Bull. 57 (1988) 274]. Shoots of aseptically established seedlings obtained from a commercial breeder were used as explants. The new combination of supplements to the MS [Phyiol. Plant. 15 (1962) 473] based medium consists of MT [Proc. First Intl. Citrus Symp. 3 (1969) 1155] vitamins, glycine and inositol; 13 muM BA (N- 6 -benzyladenine); 1. 6 muM NAA (alpha -naphthaleneacetic acid); 0. 15 nim adenine sulfate. 2 H(2) O; 1. 23 mM NaH 2 PO 4. H 2 O: 0. 18 M sucrose; and 15 % (v/v) coconut milk from very young fruits, The coconut milk can be substituted with 1 g l(- 1) casein hydrolysate or 10 g l(- 1) potato tuber sections. The investigation also disclosed that TDZ (N-phenyl-N'- 1, 2, 3 -thiadiazol- 5 -yl urea) inhibited shoot proliferation and rooting, and maltose depressed rooting. The protocol enables doubling the number of Paphiopedilum plants every 12 weeks. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Treatment of Spathiphyllum patinii, cv. Merry, {{six months}} after {{planting}} their <b>mericlone</b> plantlets to pots with 500 and 1000 ppm gibberellin A 3 (GA 3) either by spraying onto the leaves or by dropping onto the uppermost leaf sheath induced flowering. Flower stalks developed {{not only from the}} uppermost leaf sheath of the main axis following development of 3 or 4 additional leaves but also from the lower leaf sheath. The control plants without GA 3 did not flower within the experimental period. Furthermore, treatment with 100 to 1000 ppm GA 3 of the cut tuberous-stem pieces and <b>mericlone</b> plantlets produced miniature-flowering plants with new 2 leaves. These results suggest that floral induction at the shoot apex of Spathiphyllum plants occurs soon after the treatment with GA 3 regardless of their age, size and growing seasons. The method employed in the present experiment should be useful for rapid production of small or miniature flowering Spathiphyllum plants which are used not only as a new interior ornament, but also as an experimental plant and a method for physiological study of flower initiation by gibberellins. スパティフィラムのメリクロン苗を培養土を入れた鉢に植え 6 か月間栽培した展開本葉 5 － 7 枚の草丈 18 － 22 cm の植物を用いて， 500 あるいは 1000 ppmのジベレリンA 3 （GA 3 ）溶液を葉面散布または最上葉の葉鞘内に滴下する と，その後展開した 3 あるいは 4 枚めの葉の葉鞘から白色楕円形の苞葉が出現し，花茎が伸長して開花した。また， 下位葉の葉鞘からも花茎が伸長して開花した。 肥大根茎の切断片およびメリクロン苗を， 10 から 1000 ppm GA 3 の溶液に 20 時間ひたして培養土に植えると，葉を 2 枚待った小さい開花植物を生じた。 これらの実験結果は，GA 3 を処理すると，スパティフィラムの花成が，草齢や植物体の大きさに関係なくすぐに 誘導されることを示している。GA 3 による若齢のスパティフィラムの花成誘導は，小型の鉢花生産にまたジベレリ ンによる花成誘導の生理学的研究に利用できる...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Viral {{diseases}} affecting sweetpotato are {{the most}} devastating and cause up to 98 % yield loss. In this paper, we report, meristem culture, graft transmission and virus indexing for management of viral pathogens in seven elite sweetpotato cultivars. Plantlets were developed in vitro from the apical meristematic dome with one to two leaf primordia. <b>Mericlones</b> were grafted on virus-sensitive indicator plant Ipomoea setosa and no viral disease symptoms were seen on I. setosa leaves in most cases. This indicates that no viruses translocated from meristem-derived scions to the virus-sensitive root stock. On the other hand, most of the non-tested traditional planting material induced distinct disease symptoms upon grafting, which revealed the presence {{of one or more}} viruses in it. About 85 % of <b>mericlones</b> recovered from 0. 3 – 0. 5 mm size meristem were tested as virus free, whereas it is dif-ficult to culture meristems smaller than 0. 3 mm due to dissection damage and too small a size. Virus-tested mer-iclones were further micropropagated and transferred to the field. Only few plants were found to be diseased in the R 1 field trial. Root yield in the R 2 generation was increased significantly when compared with non-tested control plants. During field exposure, only a low percentage of healthy plants were found infected with viruses when managed in a net house. This implies that viral vectors were present during the growing season and reinfection could be effectively reduced by net house management. We concluded that this low-cost technique of producing virus-tested planting material would significantly boost the yield through efficient removal of yield-reducing pathogens...|$|R
