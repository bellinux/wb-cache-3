When I {{discovered}} the general fact that electrolytes refused to yield their elements to a current {{when in the}} solid state, though they gave them forth freely if in the liquid condition (380. 394. 402.), I thought I saw an opening to the elucidation of inductive action, and the possible subjugation of many dissimilar phenomena to one law. For let the electrolyte be water, a plate of ice being coated with platina foil on its two surfaces, and these coatings connected with any continued source of the two electrical powers, the ice will charge like a Leyden arrangement, presenting a case of common induction, but no current will pass. If the ice be liquefied, the induction will fall to a certain degree, because a current can now pass; but its passing is dependent upon a peculiar molecular arrangement of the particles consistent with {{the transfer of the}} elements of the electrolyte in opposite directions, the degree of discharge and the quantity of elements evolved being exactly proportioned to each other (377. 783.). Whether the charging of the <b>metallic</b> <b>coating</b> be effected by a powerful electrical machine, a strong and large voltaic battery, or a single pair of plates, makes no difference in the principle, but only in the degree of action (360). Common induction takes place in each case if the electrolyte be solid, or if fluid, chemical action and decomposition ensue, provided opposing actions do not interfere; and it is of high importance occasionally thus to compare effects in their extreme degrees, for the purpose of enabling us to comprehend the nature of an action in its weak state, which may be only sufficiently evident to us in its stronger condition (451.). As, therefore, in the electrolytic action, induction appeared to be the first step, and decomposition the second (the power of separating these steps from each other by giving the solid or fluid condition to the electrolyte being in our hands); as the induction was the same in its nature as that through air, glass, wax, &c. produced by any of the ordinary means; and as the whole effect in the electrolyte appeared to be an action of the particles thrown into a peculiar or polarized state, I was led to suspect that common induction itself was in all cases an action of contiguous particles[A], and that electrical action at a distance (i.e. ordinary inductive action) never occurred except through the influence of the intervening matter.|$|E

50|$|Zinc {{coated steel}} {{substrate}} for PPGI is typically produced on a continuous galvanizing line (CGL). The CGL may include a painting section after the {{hot dip galvanising}} section, or more commonly the <b>metallic</b> <b>coated</b> substrate in coil form is processed on a separate continuous paint line (CPL). <b>Metallic</b> <b>coated</b> steel is cleaned, pre-treated, applied with various layers of organic coatings which can be paints, vinyl dispersions, or laminates.

40|$|A {{study of}} Abrasive Waterjet (AWJ) cutting of <b>metallic</b> <b>coated</b> sheet steels is {{presented}} {{based on a}} statistically designed experiment. It shows that AWJ cutting is a viable technology for processing <b>metallic</b> <b>coated</b> sheet steels with good productivity and kerf quality. A scanning electron microscopy analysis indicates that micromachining and plastic deformation are the dominant cutting phenomena in sheet steel processing. Plausible trends and relationships between kerf characteristics and process parameters are discussed. It is found that an optimum water pressure together with small standoff distance between the nozzle and workpiece may be used, while the traverse speed should be selected as high as possible for through cuts {{in order to increase}} the cutting rate. Empirical models for kerf geometry and quality are finally established for the prediction and optimization of AWJ cutting performance...|$|R

40|$|Esophagojejunal {{anastomosis}} fistula is {{the main}} complication after a total gastrectomy. To avoid a complex procedure on friable inflamed perianastomotic tissues, a coated self-expandable stent is mounted {{at the site of}} the anastomotic leak. A complication of stenting procedure is that it might lead to distal esophageal stenosis. However, another frequently encountered complication of stenting is stent migration, which is treated nonsurgically. When the migrated stent creates life threatening complications, surgical removal is indicated. We present a case of a 67 -year-old male patient who was treated at our facility for a gastric adenocarcinoma which developed, postoperatively, an esophagojejunostomy fistula, a distal esophageal stenosis, and a <b>metallic</b> <b>coated</b> self-expandable stent migration.

50|$|The {{most common}} other pulse {{compressor}} {{is based on}} gratings (see Chirped pulse amplification), which can easily create a much larger negative dispersion than a prism compressor (centimeters rather than tenths of millimeters). However, a grating compressor has losses of at least 30% due to higher-order diffraction and absorption losses in the <b>metallic</b> <b>coating</b> of the gratings. A prism compressor with an appropriate anti-reflection coating can have less than 2% loss, {{which makes it a}} feasible option inside a laser cavity. Moreover, a prism compressor is cheaper than a grating compressor.|$|E

50|$|Caveat: The rule about phase shifts {{applies to}} beamsplitters {{constructed}} with a dielectric coating, {{and must be}} modified if a <b>metallic</b> <b>coating</b> is used, or when different polarizations are taken into account. Also, in real interferometers, the thicknesses of the beamsplitters may differ, and the path lengths are not necessarily equal. Regardless, {{in the absence of}} absorption, conservation of energy guarantees that the two paths must differ by a half wavelength phase shift. Also note that beamsplitters that are not 50/50 are frequently employed to improve the interferometer's performance in certain types of measurement.|$|E

A plated or sputtered magnetic layer could be made much thinner than the coated urethane binder layer. Magnets don't like to be square, but rather rectangular. So, in the thin film one could place the magnetized domains much closer together whilst keeping the overall shape of the domain rectangular. This meant that adjacent magnetized areas of the disk surface could exist without cancelling each other out, or erasin g the information recorded on the disk surface.|$|E
