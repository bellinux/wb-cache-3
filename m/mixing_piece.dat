40|$|AbstractWe have {{synthesized}} {{metal oxide}} nanoparticles through hydrothermal reaction at around 400 °C and 25 MPa by mixing {{the stream of}} metal ion solution at room temperature with another stream of supercritical water in a continuous flow-type reactor. In order to visualize the mixing behavior of the two streams, we performed neutron tomography measurements. By performing tomography measurements while rotating the <b>mixing</b> <b>piece</b> with supplying supercritical water and room temperature water, we succeeded in obtaining the three dimensional distribution of neutron attenuation. The results clearly showed how the two streams mix, {{which serves as a}} reference for numerical simulation...|$|E
