Cubature formulae involving both function evaluations and one-dimensional integration are furnished and numerical experiments to investigate the efficacy of the error formulae are performed.

In one dimension, linear kernels with a parametric discontinuity furnish "three point" rules where sampling occurs at the boundary and an interior point. The error is bounded in terms of the Lebesgue norms of the first derivative of the integrand. In two dimensions for a rectangular region, we find that the rule generalises to three "three point" rules in each dimension. That is nine sample points and six one dimensional integrals. The error bound is expressed in terms of norms of the first <b>mixed</b> <b>partial</b> <b>derivative</b> of the integrand.

Particular attention is applied to identifying a priori two dimensional grids for which the error bound is minimized.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the linear propagation of a paraxial optical beam in anisotropic media.

The wave equation has a term containing the second <b>mixed</b> <b>partial</b> <b>derivative</b> which originates from the anisotropy, and this term can result in {{the rotation of the}} beam spot. The rotation effect is investigated by solving analytically the wave equation with an initial elliptical Gaussian beam for both uniaxial and biaxial media. For both media, it is found that there exists a specific direction, which is dependent on anisotropy of the media, on the cross-section perpendicular to propagation direction to determine the rotation of the beam spot. When the major axis of the elliptical spot of the input beam is parallel to or perpendicular to the specific direction, the beam spot will not rotate during propagation, otherwise, it will rotate with the direction and the velocity determined by input parameters of the beam.
