40|$|The {{study is}} an attempt to explore the nature and role of the <b>Arab</b> <b>press</b> in the <b>Arab</b> foreign policy. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first effort to {{investigate}} empirically the relationship between the press and foreign policy in a regional context. The Arab region which consists of 22 sovereign and independent Arab states was selected to conduct this research. However, 4 Arab countries were chosen, as a sample, for their active influential and participative role in Arab foreign policy and diplomacy. This study has two levels of investigation: the general level and the particular one. Under the general level there are three aims. (1) The main aim is to investigate the nature and role of the national (domestic) <b>Arab</b> <b>press</b> in <b>Arab</b> foreign policy. (2) The second aim is to investigate the nature and role of the emigre <b>Arab</b> <b>press</b> in <b>Arab</b> foreign policy. (3) The subordinate aim is the investigate the relationship between the <b>Arab</b> <b>press</b> and the intelligence service. Under the particular level, there are two revealing case studies. The first one between Saudi Arabia and Egypt, and the second one between Saudi Arabia and Sudan. Both case studies investigate the role of the various <b>Arab</b> <b>press</b> in the foreign policy and diplomacy of those selected countries.;For this study, I interviewed prominent Arab officials and Arab journalists in four major Arab capitals: Beirut, Damascus, Cairo and Riyadh.
