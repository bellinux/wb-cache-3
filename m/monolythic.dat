50|$|The Israeli UZI sub-machinegun {{was taken}} as a basis, and several {{technical}} solutions of such weapon were outright adopted, including the telescoping bolt (already in use in another Italian sub-machinegun, the Beretta PM-12), the safety/fire selector switch and the grip safety, and housing of the magazine in the pistol grip. However, SOCIMI/Franchi engineers wanted to distinguish their weapon from the original UZI, by developing {{a wide array of}} newer features.The SOCIMI sub-machinegun was built around a solid, <b>monolythic</b> rectangular receiver made out of one single piece of lightweight alloy, departing from the UZI's heavy stamped steel receiver design; the SOCIMI receiver has one single opening on the rear from which the entire bolt assembly can be extracted, while the barrel is inserted in the front and secured by a nut, and can be separated from the receiver by unscrewing it like in the UZI. The grip has finger grooves for better handling.|$|E

This paper {{concerns}} {{with the various}} possibilities to encode space-signals for PCM-telemetry. It first reviews the logic design schemes to count binary events, to read out counted numbers, to compress data by floating point representation, and to convert analog signals with large dynamic ranges to binary numbers. Then, sane technical solutions, which are under development by DVL in cooperation with German industry, are described as examples.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 18 - 20, 1966 / Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThis paper {{describes}} a new all solid state airborne low level PAM multicoder that employs N-channel FET {{for all the}} analog switching functions of the system. The unit features a 72 KHz true chopper amplifier that affords complete isolation between input and output. This unit is fully developed and went into production in June 1966 offering many advanced features to airborne telemetry system users. Each input channel presents a true differential analog switch into the low level D. C. amplifier. The operating characteristics such as C. M. R. (100 db) out to 1 KHz, no D. C. drift or gain-change, and selectable pedestal levels add to ease of operation and flexibility. Heavy use of integrated circuits was also made including <b>monolythics,</b> hybrids and discrete elements. The gating logic, chopper amplifier front end, and carrier amplifier/synchronous demodulator each have a separate power supply winding thus providing excellent isolation for user applications. Mechanical construction employs plug in boards affording ease of manufacture and complete interchangeability of boards between units. The system is discussed as to unique features and techniques necessary to build the unit and satisfy stringent specifications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: CTA will be {{an array}} of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) for VHE gamma-ray {{astronomy}} with a proposed total mirror area of approximately 10000 square meters. The challenge is to develop lightweight and cost-efficient mirrors with high production rates and good long-term durability. Several technologies are currently under rapid development: sandwich structures based on carbon/glassfibre-epoxy composite materials and <b>monolythic</b> carbon fibre structures, either with glass or epoxy surfaces; cold-slumped glass sheets with aluminium honeycomb or glass foam as structural material; all-Aluminium mirrors. New surface coatings are under investigation {{with the aim of}} increasing the reflectance and long-term durability. In addition, new methods for a fast and reliable testing of thousands of mirror...|$|E
40|$|Breakdown {{delay times}} are {{measured}} and velocities of forming a conductive channel in aluminum oxide based porous ceramic materials impregnated with transformer oil are determined for pulsed electrical breakdown initiated by nanosecond pulses at a voltage of 140 kV. The breakdown delay times are also measured in monolithic aluminum oxide ceramics and leuco-sapphire single crystals. It is demonstrated that in porous ceramics, the average velocity of breakdown channel propagation decreases with increasing {{volume of the}} sample occupied by the liquid dielectric in comparison with single crystal and <b>monolythic</b> ceramics; it makes 50 % of the velocity of breakdown channel propagation in leuco-sapphire and exceeds 3 times the corresponding value in transformer oil measured at the same voltage and pulse duration. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc...|$|E
40|$|The {{vibration}} {{generated by}} railway traffic causes complaints {{not only about}} sensible vibration levels, but about significant noise levels in the building lying beside or above rail lines. Therefore numerical methods to predict the effect of train passbys {{are very important to}} possess and to develop. This paper presents a new numerical prediction method based on the Rayleigh radiation integral which al-lows us to calculate sound pressure levels inside a cavity when the normal velocity distribution along the boundary surfaces are known. For validation the method was compared to the Boundary Element Method by means of calculations on the-oretical rooms with theoretical velocity distributions along their walls. Beside these calculations, thorough measurements were carried out in buildings- mostly <b>monolythic</b> con-crete portal frame structure buildings. Synchronous, multi channel recordings of vibration and noise signals were performed. The results of the measurements and the simulations showed good agreement and are also presented in this paper. Both the development and the validation of the new method was done within the CONVURT project. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} about fourty films (documentaries are not considered), {{which have}} been chosed for their rilevance to {{a study of the}} different interpretations of the Resistance {{in the second half of}} the XX Century. Four broad periods have been identified: 1 - From the end of the war until the first half of the Fifties; the Resistance represents a nation united against the Germans: there are few Fascists and their role is irrelevant. 2 - The "economic miracle" and the centre-left governments. In 1961 Italy celebrates the centenary of the unification. This is the occasion for a first serious reflection and for a critical reappraisal of the past. The <b>monolythic</b> image of the Resistance begins to crumble and the image of the civil war appears. 3 - The Seventies. The Resistance is considered as a phase of the class struggle that marks Italian history since before Unification, and is far from being over. 4 - The Eighties. Two themes prevail: the exploration of the "darker" side of the Resistance and - above all - its relation with menory...|$|E
40|$|We propose an Eulerian {{framework}} for modelling uid–structure interaction (FSI) of incompressible uids and elastic structures. The model {{is based on}} an Eulerian approach for describing structural dynamics. This is achieved by tracking the movement of the initial positions of all ‘material ’ points. In this approach the displacement appears as a primary variable in an Eulerian framework. Our approach uses a technique which is similar to the level set method in so far that it also tracks initial data, in our case the set of initial positions (IP), and from this determines to which ‘phase ’ a point belongs. To avoid the occasional reinitialization of the initial position set we employ the harmonic continuation of the structure velocity eld into the uid domain. By using the IP set for tracking the structure displacement, we can ensure that corners and edges of the uid–structure interface are preserved well. Based on this <b>monolythic</b> model of the FSI we apply the Dual Weighted Residual (DWR) method for goal-oriented a posteriori error estimation to stationary FSI problems. Examples are presented based on the model and for the goal-oriented local mesh adaptation. Copyright? 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|The two source {{energy balance}} model (TSEB) can {{estimate}} evaporation (E), transpiration (T), and evapotranspiration (ET) of vegetated surfaces, which has important applications in water resources management for irrigated crops. The TSEB requires soil (TS) and canopy (TC) surface temperatures to solve the energy budgets of these layers separately. Operationally, usually only composite surface temperature (TR) measurements are available at a single view angle. For surfaces with nonrandom spatial distribution of vegetation such as row crops, TR often includes both soil and vegetation, which may have vastly different temperatures. Therefore, TS and TC must be derived from a single TR measurement using simple linear mixing, where an initial estimate of TC is calculated, and the temperature – resistance network is solved iteratively until energy balance closure is reached. Two versions of the TSEB were evaluated, where a single TR measurement was used (TSEB-TR) and separate measurements of TS and TC were used (TSEB-TC-TS). All surface temperatures (TS, TC, and TR) were measured by stationary infrared thermometers that viewed an irrigated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) crop. The TSEB-TR version used a Penman–Monteith approximation for TC, rather than the Priestley-Taylor-based formulation used in the original TSEB version, because this {{has been found to}} result in more accurate partitioning of E and T under conditions of strong advection. Calculations of E, T, and ET by both model versions were compared with measurements using microlysimeters, sap flow gauges, and large <b>monolythic</b> weighing lysimeters, respectively. The TSEB-TR version resulted in similar overall agreement with the TSEB-TC-TS version for calculated and measured E (RMSE = 0. 7 mm d‒ 1) and better overall agreement for T (RMSE = 0. 9 vs. 1. 9 mm d‒ 1), and ET (RMSE = 0. 6 vs. 1. 1 mm d‒ 1). The TSEB-TC-TS version calculated daily ET up to 1. 6 mm d‒ 1 (15 %) less early in the season and up to 2. 0 mm d‒ 1 (44 %) greater later in the season compared with lysimeter measurements. The TSEB-TR also calculated larger ET later in the season but only up to 1. 4 mm d‒ 1 (20 %). ET underestimates by the TSEB-TC-TS version may have been related to limitations in measuring TC early in the season when the canopy was sparse. ET overestimates later in the season by both versions may have been related to a greater proportion of non-transpiring canopy elements (flowers, bolls, and senesced leaves) being out of the TC and TR measurement view...|$|E
