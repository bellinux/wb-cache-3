30|$|Despite {{the efforts}} made by public {{policies}} to boost innovation (particularly in small companies) notably through {{the increase of}} relationships between academic research and business and the clustering policy (Laperche and Uzunidis 2011), these results are still disappointing. The ratio gross domestic expenditure {{on research and development}} (GERD) on GDP has reached 2.26 % in France in 2010 (above the Euro- 27 average of 2 %) but is much lower than Nordic countries (Iceland, Finland, Sweden and Denmark, with all more than 3 %), Japan (3.45 %) and USA (2.79 %) (European Commission 2012)d. Enterprises represent 63 % of the French GERD but it is mainly the big enterprises who invest in R&D (they represent 70 % of the total of enterprises expenditures) are concentrated in a small number of sector: automotive sector, pharmaceutical, aeronautics and space industry (INSEE). In 2012, France ranks 6 in terms of patents filed in Europe, after the USA, Japan, Germany, China and Korea and is not a European leader in <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>high-tech</b> sectors.|$|E
30|$|Today, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>high-tech</b> {{engineering}} problems require {{to optimize}} {{at least three}} parameters which are time-consuming and sometimes expensive. Indeed, it is mainly {{the advent of the}} computer in the early 1960 s which spurred many advances in the study of complex systems [1]. Hence, with the rapid advancement in computational technology, bio-inspired algorithms {{play a significant role in}} scientific problems, particularly in engineering fields. In other words, there are numerous practical algorithms, for instance, Genetic Algorithm (GA) [17], Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [18], Simulated Annealing (SA) [19, 20], etc., and sometimes hybrid algorithms are also performed [21, 22], but unfortunately the use of some novel algorithms compared with GA, and PSO are low, especially in FPSE, although the results were satisfactory. In nature, ants accidently search for food (or a source of food), consequently, go back to the colony and itself leave behind itself a chemical substance, namely, pheromone (which can be easily observed in white color after the rain). Other agents, when they find the appropriate route, occasionally, leave the wanderer and follow the new path. ACO has some advantages such as, no central control on ants, quick, neglecting unimportant factors which do not have considerable effect on the system performance, and more importantly, the behavior of each ant is not predictable and some ants opt a longer pass which enable the system to adapt itself to environmental changes [23, 24]. These profound investigations made us eager us to employ ACO. It is worth noting that the proposed method in this work has not been reported and ACO has not been performed on such systems.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1991 This study {{examined}} the role personality plays in the founding and successful operation <b>of</b> <b>High-Tech</b> businesses in the State of Washington, using field data gathered for this purpose. It asked three questions: Does personality type affect {{the likelihood that a}} person will found a business? Does personality type affect the kinds of businesses founded? Does the personality type of founders affect their success or failure in running High-Tech firms?The results showed that personality type does affect the likelihood that a person will found a business, and that the types which found most businesses are Myers-Briggs types sensing-thinking-judging (STJ), intuitive-thinking-judging (NTJ), and intuitive-thinking-perceptive (NTP). The results also showed that NTJs and NTPs founded <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the <b>High-Tech</b> businesses, whereas the NTJs and STJs founded <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the non-High-Tech businesses included in the sample. Finally, and unexpectedly, the results showed that the NTJs were both the most successful and the most unsuccessful types in running High-Tech firms. The study concluded that Jungian personality theory as operationalized by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator provided a holistic conceptual and reliable measurement tool for the purpose of evaluating the effect of personality on the founding and successful operation of businesses. It also concluded that a different balance of personality types is needed to effectively run firms in different life-cycle stages. Finally, the study concluded that {{there is a lack of}} feeling types among Founder/CEOs <b>of</b> <b>High-Tech</b> firms, which is paradoxical considering the emphasis on participative management practices in the Hi-Tech industry...|$|R

Its role in the process of architectural design is parallel to this relationship. In this study, the idea which is aimed to achieve is that technology which was once a part of an artisanal production, has been taken up as a problem of modernization in the development of industrialization. The study which aims at demonstrating this alterations, tries to question the ways of seeking a tectonically sensitive dimension in architecture in the age of information including a series of comparative analysis. Within {{the scope of}} this study, while putting forward the spatial characteristics <b>of</b> <b>high-tech</b> architecture as a follower of a constructive tradition, building technology of the last decade in Turkey has been included in the discussion. The discussion has been enriched by conceptual definitions {{in order to determine the}} terminology of the subject.
