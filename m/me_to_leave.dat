500|$|The {{performances}} were recorded by Japan's CBS/Sony record label {{under the supervision}} of Teo Macero, Davis' producer of 15 years. Unlike with his previous electric albums, Macero abstained from editing and splicing the recordings because, as he later told Musician magazine, [...] "the Japanese specifically wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> in the spacy things." [...] They were released as two double albums—Agharta, featuring the afternoon concert, was first released in Japan in August 1975 and later in North America in 1976; the evening show was issued in Japan as Pangaea in 1976.|$|E

500|$|On 12 June 2014, Premier League club Chelsea signed Fàbregas on {{a five-year}} {{contract}} for a fee {{in the region of}} €33million. Following his transfer he took the number 4 shirt, previously worn by David Luiz. Fàbregas spoke of his transfer, saying, [...] "I asked Barcelona to find a way for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the club. The president tried to stop the sale, but I already had my mind made up." [...] He went on to say, [...] "If I didn't think that I'd be happy at Chelsea, I would've never made this decision. Above all, I want to be happy both professionally and personally." ...|$|E
500|$|Liu Xia {{was under}} house-arrest almost {{immediately}} after the announcement, and was escorted to Liaoning to visit her imprisoned husband. She reported that she was denied visitors, her telephones were repeatedly down, and complained that even her elderly mother {{had not been able}} to get through to her. Visitors were denied entrance to her residential compound, including Norwegian diplomats who had tried to visit her on 12 October; she was able to send out a few messages through Twitter. Chinese police stationed there cordoned off the area. Thus, journalists and well-wishers were kept at bay for several hours after the announcement; as she was being taken away to see her husband, Reuters heard her say [...] "they are forcing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Beijing". Dissident groups reported on 18 October that numerous supporters and associates of Liu may have been detained by police—that Tiananmen Mother Ding Zilin, and her husband Jiang Peikun, had not been seen or heard of for four days, and that their phones were cut off. Writer Jiang Qisheng went missing just days after the Nobel announcement.|$|E
500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E

On-screen Carmel's {{marriage}} collapsed, and the following month her father died, so she left Walford to tend to her grieving mother. She last appeared in August 1989.|$|E

2500|$|Wolfowitz entered Cornell University in 1961. He {{lived in}} the Telluride House in 1962 and 1963, while {{philosophy}} professor Allan Bloom served as a faculty mentor living in the house. In August 1963, {{he and his mother}} participated in the civil-rights march on Washington organized by Martin Luther King, Jr. Wolfowitz {{was a member of the}} Quill and Dagger society. Wolfowitz graduated in 1965 with a B.A. in mathematics. Against his father's wishes, Wolfowitz decided to go to graduate school to study political science. Wolfowitz would later say that [...] "one of the things that ultimately led <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> mathematics and go into political science was thinking I could prevent nuclear war." ...|$|E
2500|$|Korff {{wrote that}} Constantine's [...] "was {{completed}} or, at all events, received its final arrangement" [...] {{in the very}} end of 1821 when all four brothers reunited in Saint Petersburg. On [...] , 1822 Constantine sent [...] "a humble petition" [...] to Alexander, expressing his wish to pass the rights to the throne to the next in line, Nicholas. Two weeks later Alexander wrote to Constantine that the matter was still not resolved. The closing paragraph was especially ambiguous and could have been interpreted as leaving the final outcome in Constantine's hands: [...] "It therefore remains to herself [...] as well as to <b>me</b> ... <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> you fully at liberty to execute your irrevocable determination...".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, Real Madrid wanted to sell Van der Vaart, but the player decided to stay in Madrid because his wife was {{undergoing}} cancer treatment there. A year later, upon his move to England, Van der Vaart stated, [...] "She had a very serious illness {{and it is true}} that she had to be treated at the Clinica Quiron. Last season, they wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> but I couldn't leave for that reason. Now she is well {{and the only thing that}} happened was that Madrid wanted to sell and I wanted to get back to enjoying playing football, and Tottenham are a great team that are going to give me the football opportunities that I need." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Ratcliff, Sue getting {{pregnant}} {{put her in}} a dilemma because she worried that happiness for the Osmans would need to be curtailed if she decided to leave the programme; she felt this would be unfair on viewers because of all the misery Sue had been put through on-screen already. Discussing this in 1987, Ratcliff said, [...] "I knew nothing about the baby plans until a few weeks ago when I came back from my holidays and was told that Sue was pregnant again. Sue has gone through enough {{in the last couple of}} years. I'm glad she's got her dearest wish [...] I think she'll make a great mum and I'm sure Ali will be supportive. Hopefully, the storylines will open up for me, but it also means that if the pregnancy goes well and the baby is fine, it would be very difficult for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> without there being another tragedy in the Osman family. I don't think that would be fair on the show or the viewers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Illness {{prompted}} Darwin {{to take a}} {{break from}} the pressure of work: on 15 June he told his cousin [...] William Darwin Fox; [...] "I have not been very well of late, which has suddenly determined <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> London earlier than I had anticipated. I go by the steam-packet to Edinburgh. – take a solitary walk on Salisbury crags & call up old thoughts of former times then go on to Glasgow & the great valley of Inverness, – near which I intend stopping a week to geologise the parallel roads of Glen Roy, – thence to Shrewsbury, Maer for one day, & London for smoke, ill health & hard work." [...] On 23 June 1838 he took the steamboat to Edinburgh to go [...] "geologising" [...] in Scotland. After revisiting Edinburgh on 28 June (the day that Queen Victoria had her coronation in London) he went on to Fort William. At Glen Roy in glorious weather he was convinced that he had solved the riddle of the [...] "parallel roads" [...] around the glen, which he identified as raised beaches, though later geologists would support the ideas of Louis Agassiz that these had been formed by glaciation.|$|E
2500|$|When Narayanan {{returned}} to India in 1948, Laski {{gave him a}} letter of introduction to Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Years later, he narrated how {{he began his career}} in the public service:When I finished with LSE, Laski, of his own, gave me a letter of introduction for Panditji. On reaching Delhi I sought an appointment with the PM. I suppose, because I was an Indian student returning home from London, I was given a time-slot. It was here in Parliament House that he met me. We talked for a few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see {{that it was time for}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> So I said goodbye and as I left the room I handed over the letter from Laski, and stepped out into the great circular corridor outside. When I was half way round, I heard the sound of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I turned to see Panditji [...] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter as I left his room and read it. [...] "Why didn't you give this to me earlier?" [...] "Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough if I just handed it over while leaving." [...] After a few more questions, he asked me to see him again and very soon I found myself entering the Indian Foreign Service.|$|E

6000|$|Then {{his father}} clung {{to him like}} a child, and wept, and would not let him go; and cried, ‘Now I shall not go down lonely to my grave. Promise <b>me</b> never <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> till I die.’ ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do not ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> you, Mrs. Bold," [...] said he with {{an impassioned}} look, impassioned and sanctified as well, with {{that sort of}} look which is not {{uncommon}} with gentlemen of Mr. Slope's school and which may perhaps be called the tender-pious. [...] "Do not ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> you till I have spoken a few words with which my heart is full--which I have come hither purposely to say." ...|$|E
