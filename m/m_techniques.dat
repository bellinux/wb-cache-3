[...] School of Nursing and Health Studies. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2013 Infants born very preterm (< 30 weeks estimated gestational age [EGA]) annually and are at greatest risk to develop significant neurodevelopmental abnormalities. These neurodevelopmental abnormalities {{are the result}} of complex conditions involving the interaction between multiple biological, genetic, and environmental risks. In an effort to manipulate and support the extra-uterine environment, infant massage has been aimed at decreasing stress and optimizing the infant's sensory experience. However, the majority of existing infant massage studies has varying protocols, are limited to healthy or convalescing preterm infants greater than 32 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), and are seldom contingent on infant behavioral cues. The <b>M</b> <b>Technique</b> is a gentle, structured, comforting touch method aimed at limiting stress and anxiety in fragile intensive care patients who are unable to tolerate conventional massage. Little is known about the effects of this technique on infants born very preterm. Therefore, the purpose of this matched case-control pilot study was to systematically test the cumulative effect of the <b>M</b> <b>Technique</b> on infant neurodevelopment, growth velocity, and physiologic and behavioral state in hospitalized very preterm infants in a Midwestern academic level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Results indicate that very preterm infants who received the <b>M</b> <b>Technique</b> over a 5 -week period did not differ significantly in neurobehavioral developmental and growth velocity compared to control infants. However, very preterm infants who received the <b>M</b> <b>Technique</b> had improved physiologic stability and more quiet sleep states from baseline to 10 minutes post the <b>M</b> <b>Technique</b> intervention over all three time points, suggesting improved physiologic stability and more quiet sleep state over time. Research regarding the type, timing, and duration of comforting touch in infants born very preterm starting at 30 weeks' PMA is lacking. Preliminary findings from this study support an infant-driven (e. g., where the protocol is based on each infant response or cues) <b>M</b> <b>Technique</b> intervention to promote comfort and relaxation in highrisk infants born very preterm. A longitudinal research design with a larger sample size is needed to confirm and expand on the effects and potential mechanisms of the <b>M</b> <b>Technique</b> on neurobehavior and growth velocity.

Internal adaptation immediately after the polishing treatment and after 30 days of storage in water at 37 ºC was evaluated by weighing a vinyl polysiloxane film reproducing the gap between resin base and metallic master model, using a precision scale. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey test and paired Student's t test, at a significance level of 0. 05. RESULTS: No significant difference in immediate adaptation was found {{as a function of}} technique, polishing treatment, or interaction of technique/polishing. After 30 days, adaptation means (g) were: CO= 2. 46 ± 0. 32 a; CQ= 3. 40 ± 0. 23 d; CW= 3. 14 ± 0. 22 c; MO= 3. 23 ± 0. 37 c, d; MQ= 3. 41 ± 0. 47 d; MW= 2. 81 ± 0. 33 b (means followed by different letters are statistically different at alpha= 0. 05).

40|$|The basic {{theories}} of Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance are outlined, together with some basic NMR theory and {{its application to}} double resonance techniques. An improved design of spectrometer using double resonance is presented, including {{a description of a}} new flow cryostat which can operate down to 4. 2 °K with low (250 cc/hour) consumption of liquid He. The whole apparatus may be used to detect NQR signals in solids over the frequency range 100 kHz- 5 MHz. The theory of double resonance with spin mixing by continuous coupling (D R CC) is developed and illustrated by experiments performed on HCOOD, HDO and several nitrogen-containing compounds, including Imidazole. Further experiments were then carried out on samples dilute in deuterium, including the detection of NQR in formic acid (HCOOH) due to naturally abundant deuterium. Other experiments on proton-deuteron interactions in amide groups and in water molecules are also described and compared with results previously published on fully-deuterated amides and D 2 0 as a water of crystallisation in L-serine hydrate. The NQR spectrum of Lanthanum Nicotinate Dihydrate is obtained using F. <b>M.</b> <b>techniques</b> and related to its structure. The theory of Zeeman NQR in spin 3 / 2 nuclei is developed with reference to the double resonance technique, and the measured quadrupole coupling constants of 23 Na and 2 D in NaOH and some of its hydrates are discussed.

Increasingly, tear stability is recognized to be important for the definition and assessment of patients with dry eye. Recently, two commercially available instruments have been made available for objectively measuring noninvasive tear break-up time (NIBUT), {{as an indicator of}} tear stability: the Tomey RT- 7000 Auto Refractor-Keratometer and Oculus Keratograph (K) 5 M. We aim to assess the agreement of NIBUT measurements using these modalities. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study was carried out in a tertiary referral eye center and involved 126 consecutive dry eye patients. NIBUT assessment was performed on the right eyes of participants with both the RT- 7000 and the K 5 <b>M</b> <b>techniques,</b> with the order of assessment randomized. The Standardized Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) questionnaires were administered to assess dry eye symptoms in the 2 weeks before assessment. Results: The age of the participants was 56. 0 ± 14. 3 years (69. 84 % females). Measurements for both modalities were non-normally distributed (right-skewed). The median RT- 7000 and K 5 M readings were 4. 2 (range 0. 1 – 10. 0) and 6. 4 (0. 1 – 24. 9) seconds, respectively. RT- 7000 and K 5 M readings were poorly correlated (ρ= 0. 061, P= 0. 495). Intraclass correlation coefficient between the modalities was 0. 187 (95 % confidence interval - 0. 097 to 0. 406). The Bland–Altman plot showed no systematic differences between the readings with these machines. The agreement between machines was not different in different SPEED categories. Conclusion: While there are theoretical and practical benefits of NIBUT for assessment of tear stability over dye-based methods, the agreement between the two modalities was poor. Hence, studies and trials assessing NIBUT should avoid using these modalities interchangeably for NIBUT assessment. More research is needed to improve consensus on how to determine NIBUT.
