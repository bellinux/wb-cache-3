5|$|An enhanced-potency IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) was {{licensed}} in the United States in November 1987, and {{is currently}} the vaccine of choice in the United States. The first dose of polio vaccine is given shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> a second dose is given at 4 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation but should be given between 6 and 18 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> A booster vaccination is given at 4 to 6 years of age, {{for a total of}} four doses at or before school entry. In some countries, a fifth vaccination is given during adolescence. Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries. In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) combination vaccine (called Pediarix) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> By 13 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E

5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs.

A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} long-eared spaniels, Russian Spaniels require checks to prevent ear infections.

5|$|Cubs start {{following}} their mothers at six weeks. The mother frequently shifts the cubs to new locations. A study of play behaviour of cheetah cubs showed that cubs tend to play after nursing or {{while they are}} on the move with their mothers. Play involves plenty of agility; attacks are seldom lethal. Playing cubs stay near their mothers. The study further revealed that while the cubs showed improvement in catching each other as they grew up, the ability to crouch and hide did not develop remarkably. Thus, it was suggested that play helps develop only certain aspects of predator defence. Weaning occurs at three to six <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> The mother brings kills to her cubs; the cubs might purr as the mother licks them clean after the meal. Cubs as young as six months try to capture small prey like hares and juvenile gazelles. However, they may have to wait until as long as 15 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> to make a successful kill on their own.|$|E
5|$|Dyadic joint {{attention}} is a conversation-like behavior that individuals engage in.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} maternal nutritional status and milk production during early gestation influenced or were correlated with parameters of the calf at birth and at 1 <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> From parturition until 90 days pregnant, blood samples were collected every 14 days in dairy cows and plasma was assayed for concentrations of glucose and β-Hydroxybutyrate (BHBA). Calves (n = 39) born from these cows were measured for blood pressure and size characteristics as well as carotid artery hemodynamics measured via Doppler ultrasonography Pulsatility Index (PI) and Resistance Index (RI). Several values were then calculated to assess the cardiovascular health of the calf. The GLM and CORR procedures of SAS were used to analyze data and significance was determined when p≤ 0. 05 and tendencies were discussed when p> 0. 05 and ≤ 0. 10. In calves at birth, mean milk production of dams during early gestation was positively correlated with heart girth. Length of gestation was positively correlated with heart girth of calves at birth and at 1 <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> Mean concentration <b>of</b> glucose in dams was positively correlated with wither height in calves at 1 <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> Length <b>of</b> gestation was negatively correlated with RI in calves at 1 <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> Milk production in the dam was positively correlated with hip and wither height and PI but negativel...|$|R

5|$|The {{previously}} described study by Timby et al. (2015) also assessed {{the effects of}} MFGM supplementation in term infants on the risk of infectious diseases and other disease symptoms. In particular, the cumulative incidence of acute otitis media was analyzed between the two randomized feeding groups (control formula or MFGM- supplemented formula to 6 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>age),</b> and compared to a breastfed reference group. The MFGM-supplemented group experienced {{a significant reduction in}} episodes of acute otitis media up to 6 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> compared with infants fed control formula (1% vs 9%; P=0.034); with no significant difference in otitis media incidence compared to the breastfed group (0%). In addition, a significantly lower incidence and longitudinal prevalence of antipyretic drug use was seen in the MFGM-supplemented group (25%) compared with the control formula group (43%). Timby et al. (2017) further showed that the MFGM supplementation influenced the infants’ oral microbiota; the authors noted that, Moraxella catarrhalis, a common bacterial cause of acute otitis media, was less prevalent in infants fed the MFGM-supplemented formula than in those fed control formula.|$|E
