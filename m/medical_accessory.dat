50|$|Instructors at the United States Air Force Academy {{conducted}} a double-blind {{study of the}} Phiten claim. Initially the instructors became interested in this product because of the company's claims that it could cause relaxation, maximize strength and energy. When looking into the product before testing they flagged several concerns; Most studies supporting Phiten were also funded by Phiten, The claims sound like the definition of pseudoscience with no mechanism to show how it could work and the claims are unfalsifiable. The packaging claims that '"not all users will experience the intended benefits."' Leaving the user {{to believe that it}} will work or it will not work. Also the instructors felt that the Phiten product was similar to other pseudoscientific <b>medical</b> <b>accessories</b> like copper bracelets, crystals and magnetic bands.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is growing}} {{advocacy}} {{for the use}} of disposable <b>medical</b> <b>accessories</b> to reduce the risks of infection transmission. Their purchase costs can, however, be considered as prohibitive in an endoscopy unit operating under a cost-containment program. We therefore compared the costs of reusable and disposable biopsy forceps. METHODS: From October 1995 to September 1997, biopsies were obtained in 7740 sessions. The evaluation of costs included purchase prices, repairs, cleaning (chemicals, equipment, technician time) and autoclaving costs in a centralized sterilization unit. For comparison, the lowest purchase price for disposable biopsy forceps was $ 26. 90 in 1997. RESULTS: A mean of 12 new reusable forceps were purchased every year for a total purchase price of $ 5460. A total of 315 biopsy sessions were performed per forceps (mean time life of 3 years per forceps, including 3 repairs). Yearly repair cost was $ 3308, equipment $ 1002, chemicals $ 3250, central sterilization $ 8333, and technician salary $ 4373. Total cost was $ 25, 726 and cost per biopsy session was $ 6. 65. CONCLUSIONS: Total purchase and reprocessing costs for reusable biopsy forceps were 25 % of those of disposable devices. The use of disposable biopsy forceps would have led to a yearly extra cost of $ 78, 377 in the operation of our endoscopy unit...|$|R

The subsystem is composed principally of survival equipment, bioinstrumentation devices, <b>medical</b> components and <b>accessories,</b> water- and waste-management equipment, personal-hygiene articles, docking aids, flight garments (excluding the pressure garment assembly), and various other crew-related accessories. Particular attention is given to items and assemblies that presented design, development, or performance problems: the crew optical alinement sight system, the metering water dispenser, and the waste-management system. Changes made in design and materials to improve the fire safety of the hardware are discussed. Includes bibliographical references (p. 45).

Ceramic injection moulding (CIM) process was analyzed in more detail: CIM- alumina, CIM-zirconia and CIM ferrites as the most common technical ceramics in CIM ceramic parts production, <b>medical</b> applications and <b>accessories</b> in chemical laboratories, and cores in electronic inductive components. After that our results for CIM barium hexaferrite and piezo ceramics (barium titanate) are given. The main powder characteristics, the shrinkage and density and the main electrical characteristics of the sintered samples were compared for the isostatically pressed PM (powder metallurgy) and CIM formed samples. SEM fractographs of CIM and PM samples are given for CIM green parts, debinded (white) parts and sintered parts, and PM green parts and sintered parts. The results obtained were compared to literature data before they were applied in ceramic components production...|$|R

Experts believe that the plan will {{have a positive impact on}} the lifestyle of the citizens who have been deprived of any such facility for a long time. Under the proposed plan, the government will stop the flow of water for a few weeks to properly clean the basin of the Canal and design it to avoid any accidents.Stairs would be built in the Canal at different points with boards set up on sides mentioning the Canal’s depth to prohibit children from swimming in some places.Moreover, proper lifeguards, lifejackets, <b>medical</b> teams, swimming <b>accessories</b> and other required facilities would also be made available at the swimming points. Proper food stalls and greenery in sitting places with proper maintenance will also be ensured to entertain visitors who do not know how to swim.|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{arteriovenous}} malformations (PAVMs) are structurally abnormal vascular communications {{that provide}} a continuous right-to-left shunt between pulmonary arteries and veins. Their importance stems from the risks they pose (> 1 in 4 patients will have a paradoxical embolic stroke, abscess or myocardial infarction while life-threatening haemorrhage affects 1 in 100 women in pregnancy), opportunities for risk prevention, surprisingly high prevalence and under-appreciation, thus representing a challenging condition for practising healthcare professionals. The driver for the current Clinical Statement was {{the plethora of new}} data since previous hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) guidelines generated in 2006 and a systematic Cochrane Review for PAVM embolisation in 2011. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) identified key areas in which there is now evidence to drive a change in practice. Due to the paucity of data in children, this Statement focused on adults over 16 years. The Statement spans the management of PAVMs already known to be present (interventional and medical), screening and diagnosis (for PAVMs and HHT) and follow-up of patients following a first diagnosis, intervention or negative screen for PAVMs. The Good Practice Points (in bold) were generated for a target audience of general respiratory, medical and specialist clinicians and were approved by the BTS Standards of Care Committee, before formal peer review and public consultation. The Statement spans embolisation treatment, <b>accessory</b> <b>medical</b> management and issues related to the likelihood of underlying HHT...|$|R
