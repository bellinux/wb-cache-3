50|$|Fairly {{new to the}} {{restaurant}} industry, the recirculating soaker {{does most of the}} work itself with little manual scrubbing required. While the actual design is a bit more complex, these units basically consist of a big water pump built into a pot sink.

While this motion will quickly wash away light to <b>medium</b> <b>soil,</b> heavy soil and baked-on carbon deposits could require some scrubbing. Some units also have built-in heaters that work in conjunction with the circulating jets. By keeping the water warm, these heaters act as an aid in loosening soil.|$|E

50|$|Giao Thuy {{district}} lies in {{the tropical}} monsoon region, which has two distinct seasons. One hot and rainy season from April to October and a cold and dry season from November to March. The annual average temperature is 24 °C. The highest temperature in summer is 40.3 °C and the coldest temperature in winter is 6.8 °C. The average humidity is 84%. The annual rainfall is between 1700 mm and 1800 mm. Averagely there are 133 rainy days per year. Rain mainly falls in summer or winter. With 15-18 rainy days August is the month with the most rainfall in contrast to autumn and winter with the lowest rainfall (25-50 mm per month). From July to October the Red River is flooded, which influences the region {{as well as the}} northeast monsoon. In winter the wind mainly comes from the north and in summer from the east. July and August seem to be the stormiest months in the year where storms are followed by heavy rain. Three strong storms hit the north of Vietnam in 2005 (28 July one wind with level 7, 18 September with level 9 and on 28 September with level 12). There are two types of soil formed from the alluvium of the Red River. One is alluvial mud (which becomes loam) and one is sand.

40|$|The water {{consumption}} characteristics and water use efficiency (WUE) of poplar (Populus simonii) were investigated under {{the condition of}} three different soil water regimes, which were 70 %, 55 % and 40 % of field capacity (FC), respectively. The results showed that water potential, water content, photosynthetic rate, WUE of leaves, and plant growth rate decreased significantly with reduction in soil water content. At the level of adequate and <b>medium</b> <b>soil</b> water content, rapid growth and biomass accumulation in poplar occurred during May and June, whereas this phenomenon occurred only during May under severe soil drought condition. Total {{water consumption}} and biomass growth were the greatest under adequate soil water condition, decreased under <b>medium</b> <b>soil</b> drought condition, and lowest under severe soil drought condition. Total WUE was the highest under <b>medium</b> <b>soil</b> water condition and lowest under severe soil condition. Changing patterns of water consumption for daily rate, every 10 -day rate, and month rate were quite different under these three soil water regimes. For all these three treatments, the highest monthly water consumption rate occurred during July and June. The highest water consumption over a 10 -day period was during in the second 10 days of July, the first 10 days of July, and the last 10 days of June for these three treatments, respectively. The day for the highest water consumption in the medium and severe drought treatments occurred I or 2 months earlier than the adequate soil water treatment. The daily time for the greatest water consumption was different throughout {{the life span of}} poplar under these soil water levels. According to these results, we concluded that poplar did not have the characteristics of drought-resistance plants, and we do not recommend that this tree species be planted over a wider range of the Loess Plateau in China.
