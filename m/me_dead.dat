500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A, {{calling it a}} [...] "classic" [...] and writing that it [...] "is so damn clever in how it bonds Jerry's fears about social niceties with larger fears about mortality"; he also praised Louis-Dreyfus's acting, saying that Elaine [...] "has an amusingly stark little bit of {{dialogue}} about death midway through the episode: [...] "You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. <b>Me,</b> <b>dead.</b> Imagine that!" [...] I think it's probably Louis-Dreyfus' best moment of the show so far, because she's really starting to nail Elaine's declarative, vaguely imperious, self-centered tone." [...] He also admired [...] "the estimable Barney Martin in his first appearance as Jerry's irascible dad." ...|$|E

2500|$|In one sample year, 1947, RKO under {{production}} chief Dore Schary shot fifteen A-level features at {{an average}} cost of $1 million and twenty Bs averaging $215,000. In addition to several noir programmers and full-flight A pictures, the studio put out two straight B noirs: Desperate, directed by Anthony Mann, and The Devil Thumbs a Ride, directed by Felix E. Feist. Ten straight B noirs that year came from Poverty Row's big three: Republic (Blackmail and The Pretender), Monogram (Fall Guy, The Guilty, High Tide, and Violence), and PRC/Eagle-Lion (Bury <b>Me</b> <b>Dead,</b> Lighthouse, Whispering City, and Railroaded, another work of Mann). One came from tiny Screen Guild (Shoot to Kill). Three majors beside RKO also contributed: Columbia (Blind Spot and Framed), Paramount (Fear in the Night), and 20th Century-Fox (Backlash and The Brasher Doubloon). Adding programmers to that list of eighteen would bring it to around thirty. Still, most of the majors' low-budget production during the decade was of the sort now largely ignored. RKO's representative output included the Mexican Spitfire and Lum and Abner comedy series, thrillers featuring the Saint and the Falcon, westerns starring Tim Holt, and Tarzan movies with Johnny Weissmuller. Jean Hersholt played Dr. Christian in six independently produced films released by RKO between 1939 and 1941. The Courageous Dr. Christian (1940) was a standard entry in the franchise: [...] "In {{the course of an}} hour or so of screen time, the saintly physician managed to cure an epidemic of spinal meningitis, demonstrate benevolence towards the disenfranchised, set an example for wayward youth, and calm the passions of an amorous old maid." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Beatles were {{involved}} in the spread of backmasking both as a recording technique and as the center of a controversy. The latter has its roots in an event in 1969, when WKNR-FM DJ Russ Gibb {{received a phone call from}} a student at Eastern Michigan University who identified himself as [...] "Tom". The caller asked Gibb about a rumor that Beatle Paul McCartney had died, and claimed that the Beatles song [...] "Revolution 9" [...] contained a backward message confirming the rumor. Gibb played the song backwards on his turntable, and heard [...] "Turn <b>me</b> on, <b>dead</b> man... turn <b>me</b> on, <b>dead</b> man... turn <b>me</b> on, <b>dead</b> man...". Gibb began telling his listeners about what he called [...] "The Great Cover-up", and to the original clue were added various others, including the alleged backmasked message [...] "Paul is a dead man, miss him, miss him, miss him", in [...] "I'm So Tired". The [...] "Paul is dead" [...] rumor popularized the idea of backmasking in popular music.|$|R
