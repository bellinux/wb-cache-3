50|$|The <b>Messaging</b> <b>Server</b> {{was part}} of Sun's Java Enterprise System bundle of Internet/Intranet server {{software}} from 2003 to 2006. In 2006, the <b>Messaging</b> <b>Server</b> was packaged as part of smaller bundle called the Sun Java System Communications Suite which includes Sun Java System Calendar Server, Sun Java System Instant <b>Messaging</b> <b>Server,</b> and Sun Java System Communications Express. This suite {{is now known as}} Oracle Communications Unified Communications Suite.|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”Enterprise Messaging is a {{very popular}} message {{exchange}} concept in asynchronous distributed computing environments. The Enterprise <b>Messaging</b> <b>Servers</b> are heavily used in building business critical Enterprise applications such as Internet based Order processing systems, pricing distribution of B 2 B, geographically dispersed enterprise applications. It is always desirable that <b>Messaging</b> <b>Servers</b> exhibit high performance to meet the Service Level Agreements (SLAs). There are investigations {{in this area of}} managing the performance of the distributed computing systems in different ways such as the IT administrators configuring and tuning the <b>Messaging</b> <b>Servers</b> parameters, implement complex conditional programming to handle the workload dynamics. But in practice it is extremely difficult to handle such dynamics of changing workloads {{in order to meet the}} performance requirements. Additionally it is challenging to cater to the future resource requirements based on the future workloads. Though there have been attempts to self-regulate the performance of Enterprise <b>Messaging</b> <b>Servers,</b> there is a limited investigation done in exploring feedback control systems theory in managing the <b>Messaging</b> <b>Servers</b> performance. We propose an adaptive control based solution to not only manage the performance of the servers to meet SLAs but also to pro-actively self-regulate the performance such that the <b>Messaging</b> <b>Servers</b> are capable to meet the current and future workloads. We implemented and evaluated our solution and observed that the control theory based solution will improve the performance of Enterprise <b>Messaging</b> <b>Servers</b> significantly...|$|R

40|$|PWS is a physician's {{workstation}} research prototype {{developed to}} explore the use of information management tools by physicians {{in the context of}} patient care. The original prototype was implemented in a client/server architecture using a broadcast <b>message</b> <b>server.</b> As we expanded the scope of the prototyping activities, we identified the limitations of the broadcast <b>message</b> <b>server</b> in the areas of scalability, security, and interoperability. To address these issues, we reimplemented PWS using the Open Software Foundation's Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). We describe the rationale for using DCE, the migration process, and the benefits achieved. Future work and recommendations are discussed...|$|R

50|$|The Application layer {{consists}} {{of one or}} more application <b>servers</b> and a <b>message</b> <b>server.</b> Each application server contains a set of services used to run the R/3 system. Not practical, only one application server is needed to run an R/3 system. But in practice, the services are distributed across more than one application server. This means that not all application servers will provide the full range of services. The <b>message</b> <b>server</b> is responsible for communication between the application servers. It passes requests from one application server to another within the system. It also contains information about application server groups and the current load balancing within them. It uses this information to choose an appropriate server when a user logs onto the system.|$|R
