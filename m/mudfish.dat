25|$|The Waianiwaniwa Valley {{population}} of Canterbury <b>mudfish</b> (Neochanna burrowsius) {{is the largest}} and most important {{population of}} this nationally endangered fish in existence.|$|E
25|$|In October 2002, {{staff of}} the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), were engaged by Central Plains to survey fish populations in the Waianiwaniwa River {{catchment}} {{as part of the}} investigation into the potential dam site. The survey identified a large and abundant population of Canterbury <b>mudfish</b> that had previously been unknown. NIWA concluded that the dam would be problematic for the <b>mudfish</b> as their habitat would be replaced by an unsuitable reservoir and the remaining waterways would be opened to predatory eels. Although NIWA did no further work for Central Plains Water, much of NIWA's fish survey was included in the assessment of effects on the environment prepared by URS New Zealand Limited. However, a new approach to the effects on the <b>mudfish</b> was included. Mitigation of the loss of habitat would be further evaluated following consultation with the Department of Conservation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mudfishes</b> {{are found}} in wetlands, swamps, drains and springs. They {{typically}} live in still or slowly flowing, shallow water, with thick aquatic vegetation and overhead cover.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mudfishes</b> are small, {{growing to}} a maximum of 180 mm. They have a tubular, highly flexible, scaleless body with rounded fins, {{well-developed}} flanges on the caudal peduncle, tubular nostrils, small or absent pelvic fins, and mottled brown colouration. Adults are active at night and are usually found in the benthic zone, while juveniles are active during the day and are found in open water.|$|R
6000|$|The {{succession}} {{of the species}} of animals and plants in time being established, the first question which the zoologist or the botanist had to ask himself was, What is the relation of these successive species one to another? And it is a curious circumstance {{that the most important}} event in the history of palæontology which immediately succeeded William Smith's generalisation was a discovery which, could it have been rightly appreciated at the time, would have gone far towards suggesting the answer, which was in fact delayed {{for more than half a}} century. I refer to Cuvier's investigation of the Mammalian fossils yielded by the quarries in the older tertiary rocks of Montmartre, among the chief results of which was the bringing to light of two genera of extinct hoofed quadrupeds, the Anoplotherium and the Palæotherium. The rich materials at Cuvier's disposition enabled him {69} to obtain a full knowledge of the osteology and of the dentition of these two forms, and consequently to compare their structure critically with that of existing hoofed animals. The effect of this comparison was to prove that the Anoplotherium, though it presented many points of resemblance with the pigs on the one hand and with the ruminants on the other, differed from both to such an extent that it could find a place in neither group. In fact, it held, in some respects, an intermediate position, tending to bridge over the interval between these two groups, which in the existing fauna are so distinct. In the same way, the Palæotherium tended to connect forms so different as the tapir, the rhinoceros, and the horse. Subsequent investigations have brought to light a variety of facts of the same order, the most curious and striking of which are those which prove the existence, in the mesozoic epoch, of a series of forms intermediate between birds and reptiles--two classes of vertebrate animals which at present appear to be more widely separated than any others. Yet the interval between them is completely filled, in the mesozoic fauna, by birds which have reptilian characters on the one side, and reptiles which have ornithic characters on the other. So again, while the group of fishes termed ganoids is at the present time so distinct from that of the dipnoi, or <b>mudfishes,</b> that they have been reckoned as distinct orders, the Devonian strata present us with forms of which it is impossible to say with certainty whether they are dipnoi or whether they are ganoids. {70} ...|$|R
25|$|The {{construction}} of the dam in the Waianiwaniwa Valley will eliminate the natural population and <b>mudfish</b> {{will not be able}} to live in the reservoir or any connected streams.|$|E
25|$|The Canterbury <b>mudfish</b> is {{a native}} {{freshwater}} fish of the galaxiid family that is found only in Canterbury. It is an acutely threatened species that is classified as 'Nationally Endangered'.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the wetland regions, Aboriginals {{hunted for}} kangaroo, emu, snakes, tortoise, <b>mudfish,</b> gilgies and water birds and their eggs, {{to name a}} few food sources. Aboriginal sites are known to have existed in a few {{locations}} in the Gwelup-Balcatta region.|$|E
25|$|A good {{potential}} source of food protein and supplementary income, fish culture, not only tilapia species must be encouraged, Fish are grown together with palay on rice fields with sustained irrigation water through rice-fish culture schemes. Some species such as <b>mudfish</b> and catfish can be raised even without any input or feeding {{as long as there}} is adequate water.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} scheme {{has a number}} of environmental effects. The dam would result in a loss of habitat for the endangered Canterbury <b>mudfish.</b> The dam would also affect amenity and landscape values, especially for the settlement of Coalgate. Water abstraction from the rivers will have an effect on ecology and other natural characteristics. The intensification of farming as a result of water being made available by the scheme has led to fears of increased nitrate contamination of the aquifers.|$|E
25|$|The summary Canterbury Regional Council report, by Principal Consents Advisor Leo Fietje, did {{not make}} a formal {{recommendation}} to either grant or decline the applications. However, it concluded, that {{on the basis of the}} applicant's evidence and the officer's reviews to date, that some adverse effects cannot be avoided, remedied or mitigated. Uncertainty remains over fish screens, natural character of the Waimakariri River, terrestrial ecology, and effects on lowland streams. Increased nitrate-nitrogen concentrations are considered significant. The loss of endangered Canterbury <b>mudfish</b> habitat due to the dam is considered to be a significant adverse effect. The report notes that any recommendations are not binding on the hearing panel, and that they may reach different conclusions on hearing further evidence.|$|E
500|$|Bowfin (Amia calva) are basal {{bony fishes}} related to gars in the infraclass Holostei. Common names include <b>mudfish,</b> mud pike, dogfish, griddle, grinnel, cypress trout and choupique. They are {{regarded}} as taxonomic relicts, being the sole surviving species of the order Amiiformes which dates from the Jurassic to the Eocene, persisting to the present. Although bowfin are highly evolved, they are {{often referred to as}} [...] "primitive fishes" [...] because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2006, and in January and February 2007, University of Canterbury {{researchers}} {{surveyed the}} Waianiwaniwa Valley for <b>mudfish.</b> The fish identified ranged from young recruits to mature adult fish, indicating a healthy population.

2500|$|The {{openwork}} of the tiara and collar represent tiny {{heads of}} Portuguese {{men in the}} tiara of both the Met and the British Museum examples, with eleven figures in the British Museum mask, and in the Met mask seven figures of Portuguese men alternating with six representations of <b>mudfish,</b> the West African lungfish. [...] The Portuguese, who had only recently arrived in the area, were a symbol of power and affluence to the royal court. Their iconography is identifiable by their long hair, hanging mustaches (often described as bearded), and domed hats. Benin art historian Barbara Blackmun interprets these crown adornments as a reference to Idia's ability to conduct the Portuguese power to her son's favor. <b>Mudfish</b> were a common theme in Benin royal arts, and reflected the divinity of the Oba. Edo cosmology believed that spirits crossed the ocean to reach the afterlife, where their leaders lived like gods. As creatures who could live on land and sea, the <b>mudfish</b> symbolized the duality needed for the leader's final journey, and this duality represents the seafaring Portuguese as well. [...] The <b>mudfish</b> also appear in a pattern on the Linden Museum mask's crown, while the private collection mask's crown has bird elements, also formerly present on the similar Seattle Art Museum mask. [...] The masks also differ in pattern along their bottom, collar edges. The collar of the Met example is similarly decorated with eleven Portuguese men (with damage on its proper right side), while the collar of the British Museum mask is instead an abstract guilloché latticework.|$|E

60|$|Across {{the little}} channel, {{mangroves}} rose from sloppy mud. Their roots were {{five or six}} feet high, and <b>mudfish</b> splashed in the holes beneath. Crabs crawled about the roots, for he heard their claws scratch on the smooth bark. He knew the noise; one heard it on board the schooner when the tide was low, and Marston hated the hideous mangrove-crabs that swarmed about the lagoon. They were savage and not afraid. If one sat on the sand, they crawled over one's body and their bite was sharp. A curlew's wild cry pierced the gloom and then all was quiet.|$|E
60|$|Another {{considerable}} {{innovation is}} the proposition {{to divide the}} class Pisces into the four groups of Leptocardia, Cyclostomata, Pisces, and Dipneusta. As regards {{the establishment of a}} separate class for the Lancelet (Amphioxus), I think {{there can be little doubt}} of the propriety of so doing, inasmuch as it is far more different from all other fishes than they are from one another. And there is much to be said in favour of the same promotion of the Cyclostomata, or Lampreys and Hags. But considering the close relation of the <b>Mudfish</b> with the Ganoidei, and the wide differences between the Elasmobranchii and the Teleostei, I greatly doubt the propriety of separating the Dipneusta, as a class, from the other Pisces.|$|E
6000|$|From such a {{rude and}} {{indefinite}} beginning natural selection, {{aided by the}} various concomitant principles, has slowly built up the pedigree of man. Starting from these remote half-invertebrate forms, whose vague shape is still perhaps in part preserved for us by the soft and jelly-like larva of the modern ascidian, we rise by long stages {{to a group of}} early fishes, like the lancelet itself. From these the ganoids and then the lung-bearing <b>mudfish</b> must have been gradually developed. From such fish a very small advance would carry us on to the newts and other amphibians. The duck-billed platypus helps us slightly to bridge over the gap between the reptiles and the lower mammals, such as the kangaroo and the wombat, though the connection with the amphibians is still, as when Darwin wrote, highly problematical. From marsupials, such as the kangaroo, we ascend gradually to the insectivorous type represented by the shrews and hedgehogs, and thence once more by very well-marked intermediate stages to the lemurs of Madagascar, a group linked on the one hand to the insectivores, and on the other to the true monkeys. The monkeys, again, 'branched off into two great stems--the New World and Old World monkeys; and from the latter, at a remote period, man, the wonder and glory of the universe, proceeded.' ...|$|E
6000|$|If Charles Darwin {{had never}} existed at all, there {{would still have}} been a {{considerable}} and expansive evolutionary movement both in biology and in its sister sciences throughout {{the latter half of}} the present century. The harvest indeed was ready, and the labourers, though few, were full of vigour. Suppose for a moment that that earnest and single-hearted Darwinian genius had been cut off by some untimely disease of childhood at five years old, all other conditions remaining as they were, we should even so have had in our midst to-day, a small philosophical and influential band of evolutionary workers. Spencer would none the less have given us his 'First Principles' and the major part of his 'Principles of Biology,' with comparatively little alteration or omission. Wallace would none the less have promulgated his inchoate theory of natural selection, and rallied round his primordial conception the very best and deepest minds of the biological fraction. Geology would have enforced the continuity of types; Cope and Marsh would have unearthed for our edification the ancestral forms of the evolving horse and the toothed birds of the Western American deposits. The Solenhofen lithographic slates would still have yielded us the half-reptilian, half-avian Archæopteryx; the tertiary deposits would still have presented us with a long suite of gradually specialised and modified mammalian forms. The Siberian meadows would have sent us that intermediate creature which Prjevalsky recognises as the half-way house between the horses and the donkeys; the rivers of Queensland would have disclosed to our view that strange lung-bearing and gill-breathing barramunda, in which Günther discerns the missing link between the ganoid fishes on the one hand, and the <b>mudfish</b> and salamandroid amphibians on the other. From data such as these, biologists and palæontologists of the calibre of Huxley, Gaudry, Geikie, Rütimeyer, and Busk, would necessarily have derived, by the aid of Wallace's pregnant principle, conclusions not so very far remote from Darwin's own. Heer and Saporta would have drawn somewhat similar inferences from the fossil flora of Switzerland and of Greenland; Hooker and De Candolle would have read pretty much the self-same lessons in the scattered ferns and scanty palm-trees of oceanic islands. Kowalevsky would have seen in the ascidian larva a common prototype of the vertebrate series; the followers of Von Baer would have popularised the embryological conception of the single origin of animal life. The researches of Boucher de Perthes, of Lyell, of Evans, of Boyd Dawkins, of Keller, and of Christy and Lartet, would have unrolled before our eyes, under any circumstances, the strange story of prehistoric man. On the facts so gained, Lubbock and Tylor, Schaafhausen and Büchner, would have built up their various consistent theories of human development and human culture. In short, even without Charles Darwin, the nineteenth century would not have stood still; it would have followed in the wake of Buffon and Diderot, of Lamarck and Laplace, of St. Hilaire and Goethe, of Kant and Herschel, of Hutton and Lyell, of Malthus and of Spencer. The great world never rolls down the abysses of time obedient to the nod of one single overruling Titanic intellect. 'If the doctrine of evolution had not existed,' says Huxley, 'palæontologists must have invented it.' ...|$|E
