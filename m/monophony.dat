5|$|Initially, in Ancient Greece, {{homophony}} indicated {{music in}} which a single melody is performed by two or more voices in unison or octaves, i.e. <b>monophony</b> with multiple voices. Homophony as a term first appeared in English with Charles Burney in 1776, emphasizing the concord of harmonized melody.|$|E
5|$|Homophony first {{appeared}} {{as one of}} the predominant textures in Western classical music during the Baroque period in the early 17th century, when composers began to commonly compose with vertical harmony in mind, the homophonic basso continuo becoming a definitive feature of the style. The choral arrangement of four voices (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) has since become common in Western classical music. Homophony began by appearing in sacred music, replacing polyphony and <b>monophony</b> as the dominant form, but spread to secular music, for which {{it is one of the}} standard forms today.|$|E
25|$|Extending {{across the}} American Midwest into Canada, Plains-area music is nasal, with high pitches and {{frequent}} falsettos, with a terraced descent (a step-by-step descent down an octave) in an unblended <b>monophony.</b> Strophes use incomplete repetition, meaning that songs {{are divided into}} two parts, the second of which is always repeated {{before returning to the}} beginning.|$|E
25|$|Music of the Great Basin is simple, {{discreet}} and ornate, {{characterized by}} short melodies {{with a range}} smaller than an octave, moderately-blended <b>monophony,</b> relaxed and open vocals and, most unusually, paired-phrase structure, in which a melodic phrase, repeated twice, is alternated with one to two additional phrases. A song of this type might be diagrammed as follows: AA BB CC AA BB CC, etc.|$|E
25|$|Open vocals with <b>monophony</b> {{are common}} in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, though {{polyphony}} also occurs (this is the only area of North America with native polyphony). Chromatic intervals accompanying long melodies are also characteristic, and rhythms are complex and declamatory, deriving from speech. Instrumentation is more diverse than {{in the rest of}} North America, and includes a wide variety of whistles, flutes, horns and percussion instruments.|$|E
25|$|The Ghost Dance spread {{throughout}} the Plains tribes in the 1890s and many songs are sung today. They are characterized by relaxed vocals and a narrow range. Apache-derived peyote songs, prayers in the Native American Church, use a descending melody and <b>monophony.</b> Rattles and water drums are used, in a swift tempo. The Sun Dance and Grass Dance of the plains are the roots of intertribal powwows, which feature music with terraced descent and nasal vocals, both Plains characteristic features.|$|E
25|$|The {{studies of}} Cardine and his {{students}} (Godehard Joppich, Luigi Augustoni, Johannes B. Göschl, Marie-Noël Colette, Rupert Fischer, Marie-Claire Billecocq, Alexander M. Schweitzer to name a few) have clearly demonstrated that rhythm in Gregorian chant as notated in the 10th century rhythmic manuscripts (notably Skt. Gallen and Laon) manifest such rhythmic diversity and melodic – rhythmic ornamentations {{for which there is}} hardly a living performance tradition in the Western world. Contemporary groups that endeavour to sing according to the manuscript traditions have evolved after 1975. Some practising researchers favour a closer look at non Western (liturgical) traditions, in such cultures where the tradition of modal <b>monophony</b> was never abandoned.|$|E
500|$|In music, {{homophony}} ( [...] ; [...] ὁμόφωνος, homóphōnos, from ὁμός, homós, [...] "same" [...] and φωνή, phōnē, [...] "sound, tone") is a texture {{in which}} a primary part is supported {{by one or more}} additional strands that flesh out the harmony and often provide rhythmic contrast. This differentiation of roles contrasts with equal-voice polyphony (in which similar lines move with rhythmic and melodic independence to form an even texture) and <b>monophony</b> ({{in which a}}ll parts move in unison or octaves). Historically, homophony and its differentiated roles for parts emerged in tandem with tonality, which gave distinct harmonic functions to the soprano, bass and inner voices.|$|E
2500|$|Arid American Southwest {{is home to}} {{two broad}} groupings of closely related cultures, the Pueblo and Athabaskan. The Southern Athabaskan Navajo and Apache tribes sing in Plains-style nasal vocals with {{unblended}} <b>monophony,</b> while the Pueblos emphasize a relaxed, low range and highly blended monophonic style. Athabaskan songs are swift and use drums or rattles, {{as well as an}} instrument unique to this area, the Apache fiddle, or [...] "Tsii'edo'a'tl" [...] meaning [...] "wood that sings" [...] in the Apache language.|$|E
2500|$|By 1925, Partch {{was putting}} his theory into {{practice}} by developing paper coverings for violin and viola with fingerings in just intonation, {{and wrote a}} string quartet using such tunings. [...] He put his theories in words in May 1928 in the first draft for a book, then called Exposition of <b>Monophony.</b> [...] He supported himself during this time doing a variety of jobs, including teaching piano, proofreading, and working as a sailor. [...] In New Orleans in 1930, he resolved to break with the European tradition entirely, and burned all his earlier scores in a potbelly stove.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} ancient styles of singing in Lithuania {{connected}} with ethnographical regions: <b>monophony,</b> multi-voiced homophony, heterophony and polyphony. <b>Monophony</b> mostly occurs in southern (Dzūkija), southwest (Suvalkija) and eastern (Aukštaitija) parts of Lithuania. Multi-voiced homophony, widespread in entire Lithuania, {{is the most}} archaic in Samogitia. Traditional vocal music is held in high esteem on a world scale: Lithuanian song fests and sutartinės multipart songs are on the UNESCO's representative list of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.|$|E
5000|$|According to Ardis Butterfield (1997), <b>monophony</b> [...] "is the {{dominant}} mode of the European vernacular genres {{as well as}} of Latin song ... in polyphonic works, it remains a central compositional principle." ...|$|E
5000|$|DeLone more loosely defines <b>monophony</b> as [...] "passages, movements, or {{sections}} in which notes sound alone, despite instrumental doubling" [...] even if [...] "such passages may involve several instruments or voices." ...|$|E
50|$|In the Early Middle Ages, the {{earliest}} Christian songs, called plainchant (a well-known example is Gregorian chant), were monophonic. In the 2010s, songwriters often write songs that intersperse sections using <b>monophony,</b> heterophony (two singers or instrumentalists doing varied {{versions of the}} same melody together), polyphony (two or more singers or instrumentalists playing independent melodic lines at the same time), homophony (a melody accompanied by chords) or monody (a single melodic line with instrumental accompaniment) elements throughout the melody to create different atmospheres and styles. <b>Monophony</b> may not have underlying rhythmic textures, and must consist of only a single melodic line.|$|E
5000|$|Pierre Aubry (14 February 1874 in Paris - 31 August 1910 in Dieppe) was a French musicologist (the {{first to}} use the term musicologie.) who {{specialized}} in secular <b>monophony,</b> musical palaeography and the music of the 13th century.|$|E
5000|$|Theodore Cyrus Karp (17 July 1926 - 5 November 2015) was an American musicologist. His {{principal}} area {{of study}} was saecular mediaeval <b>monophony,</b> especially {{the music of the}} trouvères. He was a major contributor in this area to the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.|$|E
50|$|Most Lithuanian {{folk music}} is based around {{various types of}} dainos, which include romantic songs, wedding songs, as well as work songs, and archaic war songs. These dainos are {{performed}} either solo, or in groups, and in parallel chords or unison. There are three ancient styles of singing in Lithuania connected with ethnographical regions: <b>monophony,</b> multi-voiced homophony, heterophony and polyphony. <b>Monophony</b> mostly occurs in southern (Dzūkija), southwest (Suvalkija) and eastern (Aukštaitija) parts of Lithuania. Multi-voiced homophony is widespread in the entire Lithuania; it is most archaic {{in the western part}} (Samogitia). Polyphonic songs are common in the renowned sutartinės tradition of Aukštaitija, occurring only sporadically in other regions. A large number of Lithuanian dainos are performed in the minor key.|$|E

5000|$|Besides trouvère <b>monophony,</b> Karp {{has written}} {{articles}} on the polyphony of the schools of Saint Martial's, Santiago de Compostela, and Notre Dame. He proposed new methods for the transcription of polyphony from the manuscripts. In more recent research Karp has studied the application of computers to his field.|$|E
5000|$|This {{movement}} {{is a single}} unharmonised melody based on a Gregorian antiphon. Each end of a phrase is repeated as an echo. Cornet registrations alternate between the Grand-Orgue, Positif and Récit manuals. The unchanging <b>monophony</b> of this movement, the simplest and purest musical form, symbolises the [...] "subtilité".|$|E
50|$|<b>Monophony</b> {{could also}} conceivably include {{more than one}} voice which do not sing in unison but whose pitches move in parallel, always {{maintaining}} the same interval of an octave. A pair of notes sung one or a multiple of an octave apart are almost in unison, due to octave equivalency.|$|E
50|$|Extending {{across the}} American Midwest into Canada, Plains-area music is nasal, with high pitches and {{frequent}} falsettos, with a terraced descent (a step-by-step descent down an octave) in an unblended <b>monophony.</b> Strophes use incomplete repetition, meaning that songs {{are divided into}} two parts, the second of which is always repeated {{before returning to the}} beginning.|$|E
5000|$|The texture in this {{movement}} is wide-ranging, from simple <b>monophony</b> to complicated counterpoint [...] At {{the beginning of}} {{the second part of the}} movement, a unison melody acts as a cantus firmus [...] In a following, fast section, the ascent of the incense is symbolised through fast semiquaver runs. These runs abruptly cut short to end the movement.|$|E
5000|$|In music, <b>monophony</b> is the {{simplest}} of musical textures, consisting of a melody (or [...] "tune"), typically sung by a single singer or played by a single instrument player (e.g., a flute player) without accompanying harmony or chords. Many folk songs and traditional songs are monophonic. A melody is also considered to be monophonic if a group of singers (e.g., a choir) sings the same melody together at the unison (exactly the same pitch) or with the same melody notes duplicated at the octave (such as when men and women sing together). If an entire melody is played by two or more instruments or sung by a choir with a fixed interval, such as a perfect fifth, it is also said to be <b>monophony</b> (or [...] "monophonic"). The Musical texture of a song or musical piece is determined by assessing whether varying components are used, such as an accompaniment part or polyphonic melody lines (two or more independent lines).|$|E
50|$|Music of the Great Basin is simple, {{discreet}} and ornate, {{characterized by}} short melodies {{with a range}} smaller than an octave, moderately-blended <b>monophony,</b> relaxed and open vocals and, most unusually, paired-phrase structure, in which a melodic phrase, repeated twice, is alternated with one to two additional phrases.

5000|$|<b>Monophony</b> was {{the first}} type of texture in the Lutheran Church. A {{well-known}} example is Martin Luther's hymn [...] "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," [...] written as a monophonic tune sometime between 1527 and 1529. Many of Luther's hymns were later harmonized for multiple voices by other composers, and were also used in other polyphonic music such as the cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach.|$|E
50|$|Georgia has {{rich and}} still vibrant {{traditional}} music, which is primarily known as arguably the earliest polyphonic {{tradition of the}} Christian world. Situated {{on the border of}} Europe and Asia, Georgia is also the home of a variety of urban singing styles with a mixture of native polyphony, Middle Eastern <b>monophony</b> and late European harmonic languages. Georgian performers are well represented in the world's leading opera troupes and concert stages.|$|E

5000|$|In Russian Orthodox liturgy of 16th-18th centuries, {{polyphony}} (многогласие, mnogoglasiye, literally [...] "many-voicing"), sometimes polyvocality, was {{a tradition}} to perform several {{parts of the}} church service {{in the same place}} at the same time, in particular, to sing several different chants simultaneously, to save time. Despite being banned in favor of (<b>monophony</b> (единогласие, edinoglasiye, literally [...] "single-voicing"), singing the chants one by one consecutively, it persisted for quite some time.|$|E
50|$|These two {{developments}} are connected. Readers will {{have noted the}} move from the <b>monophony</b> of Gregorian chants to the complicated polyphonies of madrigals and other music of the few centuries before 1500. The next shift in musical perception involves a less common term: homophonic; that is, the sounding of a harmonic chord or progression of chords, not meant to stand out, but which support an obvious melody {{on top of the}} harmony.|$|E
50|$|In music, {{polyphony}} is {{one type}} of musical texture, where a texture is, generally speaking, the way that melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic aspects of a musical composition are combined to shape the overall sound {{and quality of the}} work. In particular, polyphony consists of two or more simultaneous lines of independent melody, as opposed to a musical texture with just one voice, <b>monophony,</b> or a texture with one dominant melodic voice accompanied by chords, which is called homophony.|$|E

50|$|Lithuanian {{folk music}} belongs to Baltic music branch which is {{connected}} with neolithic corded ware culture. Two instrument cultures meet in the areas inhabited by Lithuanians: stringed (kanklių) and wind instrument cultures. Lithuanian folk music is archaic, mostly used for ritual purposes, containing elements of paganism faith. There are three ancient styles of singing in Lithuania connected with ethnographical regions: <b>monophony,</b> heterophony and polyphony. Folk song genres: Sutartinės, Wedding Songs, War-Historical Time Songs, Calendar Cycle and Ritual Songs and Work Songs.|$|E

5000|$|Technically, the Prophecy offered one-note <b>monophony,</b> several effects (including distortion, wave shaping, delay/reverb and chorus/flanger), and 128 memory {{locations}} for user sound programs. No sequencer was included, but its integrated arpeggiator {{was a source}} of [...] "instant gratification", as some magazines put it. A PCM/CIA slot allowed for offline storage of patches and banks. Standard MIDI sockets, a special socket for connecting an EC5 pedal bank, a sustain pedal socket, and a pair of audio outputs occupied the rear panel.|$|E
