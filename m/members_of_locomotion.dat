40|$|Study of technical, normative, and {{narrative}} medieval literature and of archaeological pieces allows the motor skills <b>of</b> armoured <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the aristocracy to be outlined but not quantified.

An accurate harness replica realized in an informed archaeological experimental way, close to medieval material and manufacturing conditions, was used for the experiments. Measurements of the energy cost <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> in and out of armour were taken during walking and running on a treadmill. Gait analysis and range of motion of joints were performed with 3 -D kinematics.

Methods: Two family couples (3 men and one woman) participated to laboratory and field tests. Each subject participated in two kind of walk (walk on treadmill {{at the speed of}} 5 km/h and walk on the athletic track - at natural walking speed) and according the abilities to 15 speeds <b>of</b> running <b>locomotion</b> (13 speeds on treadmill and 2 speeds on the athletic track).

40|$|Abstract: Previous {{studies have}} shown that mental imagery is a {{suitable}} tool to study the progression of the effect of practice on brain activation. Nevertheless, there is still poor knowledge of changes in brain activation patterns during the very early stages of physical practice. In this study, early and late practice stages of different kinds <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> (i. e., balanced and unbalanced) have been investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging during mental imagery <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> and stance. During the task, cardiac activity was also recorded. The cerebral network comprising supplementary motor area, basal ganglia, bilateral thalamus, and right cerebellum showed a stronger activation during the imagery <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> with respect to imagery of stance. The heart beat showed a significant increase in frequency during the imagery <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> with respect to the imagery of stance. Moreover, early stages of practice determined an increased activation in basal ganglia and thalamus with respect to late stages. In this way, it is proposed the modulation of the brain network involved in the imagery <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> as a functio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} the devel-opment of bipedal robotic control techniques for multiple locomotion behaviors. Insight into the fundamental behaviors <b>of</b> human <b>locomotion</b> is obtained through the examination of experimental human data for walking on flat ground, upstairs and downstairs. Specifically, it is shown that certain outputs of the human, independent <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> terrain, can be char-acterized by a single function, termed the extended canonical human function. Optimized functions of this form are tracked via feedback linearization in simulations of a planar robotic biped walking on flat ground, upstairs and downstairs — these three modes <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> are termed “motion primitives. ” A second optimization is presented, which yields controllers that evolve the robot from one motion primitive to another — these modes <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> are termed “motion transitions. ” A final simulation is given, which shows the controlled evolution of a robotic biped as it transitions through each mode <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> over a pyramidal staircase.

40|$|Abstract — The polychaete annelid {{marine worms}} propel {{themselves}} in a variety <b>of</b> challenging <b>locomotion</b> environments by a unique form of tail-to-head body undulations, combined with the synchronized action of numerous parapodial lateral appendages. This combined parapodial and undulatory mode <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> is termed pedundulatory in the present work. Robotic analogues of this type <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> are being studied, both in simulation, and via experiments with biomimetic robotic prototypes, which combine undulatory movements of their multi-link body with appropriately coordinated parapodial link oscillations. Extensive experimental studies <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> on sand demonstrate {{the potential of the}} pedundulatory robotic prototypes, especially their rich gait repertoire and their enhanced performance compared to robotic prototypes relying only on body undulations...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that active control <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> {{increases}} accuracy and precision of nonvisual space perception, but psychological mechanisms of this enhancement are poorly understood. The present study explored a hypothesis that active control <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> enhances space perception by facilitating crossmodal interaction between visual and nonvisual spatial information. In an experiment, blindfolded participants walked along a linear path under one of the following two conditions: (1) They walked by themselves following a guide rope; and (2) they were led by an experimenter. Subsequently, they indicated the walked distance by tossing a beanbag to the origin <b>of</b> <b>locomotion.</b> The former condition gave participants greater control <b>of</b> their <b>locomotion,</b> and thus represented a more active walking condition. In addition, before each trial, half the participants viewed the room in which they performed the distance perception task. The other half remained blindfolded throughout the experiment. Results showed that although the room was devoid of any particular cues for walked distances, visual knowledge of the surroundings improved the precision of nonvisual distance perception. Importantly, however, the benefit of preview was observed only when participants walked more actively. This indicates that active control <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> allowed participants to better utilize their visual memory of the environment for perceiving nonvisually encoded distance, suggesting that active control <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> served as a catalyst for integrating visual and nonvisual information to derive spatial representations of higher quality...|$|R
