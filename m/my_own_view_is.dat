6000|$|Here let me guard myself {{against a}} {{misinterpretation}} {{very likely to}} be put upon the foregoing arguments; especially {{by those who have}} read the Essay to which they reply. The statements of that Essay carry the implication that all who adhere to the hypothesis it combats, imagine they have solved the mystery of things when they have shown the processes of Evolution to be naturally caused. Mr. Martineau tacitly represents them as believing that, when every thing has been interpreted in terms of Matter and Motion, nothing remains to be explained. This, however, {{is by no means the}} fact. The Doctrine of Evolution, under its purely scientific form, does not involve Materialism, though its opponents persistently represent it as doing so. Indeed, among adherents of it who are friends of mine, there are those who speak of the Materialism of Buechner and his school, with a contempt certainly not less than that felt by Mr. Martineau.

60|$|It {{gives me}} pain, great pain, to {{communicate}} anything which I have even the remotest apprehension {{can give the}} slightest annoyance to you. I trust this will not do so; although I fear it may. But though fearing it may, I feel it is my duty to do it: because I have only these three alternatives before me. First, to delay communication to some subsequent opportunity: but as I have no fair prospect of being able then to convey a different statement, this plan would be attended with no advantage whatever, as far as I can see. Secondly, to dissemble my feelings: an alternative on which if I said another word I should be behaving undutifully and wickedly towards you. Thirdly, to follow the course I have now chosen, I trust with no feelings but those of the most profound affection, and of unfeigned grief {{that as far as}} <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> concerned, I am unable to make it coincide with yours.

But lest you should be led to suppose that I have never reasoned with myself on this matter, but yielded to blind impulses or transitory whims, I will state, not indeed at length, but with as much simplicity and clearness as I am able, some of the motives which seem to me to urge me with an irresistible accumulation of moral force, to this conclusion, and this alone. In the first place, I would say that my own state and character is not one of them; nor, I believe, could any views of that character be compatible with their existence and reception, but that in which it now appears to me: namely, as one on which I can look with no degree of satisfaction whatever, and for the purification of which I can only direct my eyes and offer up my prayers to the throne of God.|$|E

Shortly after the March 25 meeting, he worried about 25.2 million people who were at risk of starvation.

5000|$|Montgomery {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that the conflict could not be won without harsh measures, and that self-government for Ireland was the only feasible solution; in 1923, after the establishment of the Irish Free State and during the Irish Civil War, Montgomery wrote to Colonel Arthur Ernest Percival of the Essex Regiment: [...] Personally, my whole attention was given to defeating the rebels but it never bothered me a bit how many houses were burnt. I think I regarded all civilians as 'Shinners' and I never had any dealings with any of them. <b>My</b> <b>own</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> that to win a war of this sort, you must be ruthless. Oliver Cromwell, or the Germans, would have settled it in a very short time. Nowadays public opinion precludes such methods, the nation would never allow it, and the politicians would lose their jobs if they sanctioned it. That being so, I consider that Lloyd George was right in what he did, if we had gone on we could probably have squashed the rebellion as a temporary measure, but it would have broken out again like an ulcer the moment we removed the troops. I think the rebels would probably have refused battles, and hidden their arms etc. until we had gone.|$|E
5000|$|Sanderson's {{aforementioned}} {{address to}} the University of Leeds also encompassed {{his vision of the}} ways that education should occur, continuing as it does: The methods will change from learning in class-room to researching in the galleries; from learning things of the past to searching into the future; competition giving place to co-operative work. And somewhere within the field of work each boy or girl may find his own part, and so take part in the creative life, and grow by doing it, and be 'bitten' with the desire to do, and gain in purpose, in determination, in self-determination, in confidence, and outlook. <b>My</b> <b>own</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> that at an early stage every effort should be made to get a boy at a 'grip' with some part of knowledge, and that we must not be afraid to specialise at the early ages of fifteen to seventeen, for when once a boy has been caught with the love of research he will go on, and can widen out at a later stage. In fact, he will find the need for extending his knowledge and capacities. Examinations tend the other way, with, as I think, disastrous effects on many a creative boy.

5000|$|Lembcke's debunking of the {{spitting}} {{stories is}} quite persuasive. But he has much broader aims. Not only was there no spitting, he argues, {{but there was}} no hostility or tension at all between veterans and protesters. In fact, he characterizes their relationship as [...] "empathetic and mutually supporting." [...] It is certainly true that a remarkable number of veterans opposed the war, and that the antiwar movement did forge alliances with veterans. It is also true that American culture has given too little in-depth attention to antiwar veterans. But Lembcke insists on a strict either/or argument: Veterans and peaceniks were either enemies or comrades. [...] "Antiwar activists could not have been spitting on veterans {{while at the same time}} befriending them in off-base coffeehouses," [...] he writes. ... <b>My</b> <b>own</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> that the spitting stories are largely mythic, but that the myth itself reflects the deep anger and animosity that many veterans harbored toward the antiwar movement. Their anger often reflected a sense of class injustice that gave their more privileged peers greater freedom to avoid the war. ... I base my conclusions on extensive interviews I have conducted with Vietnam veterans since the early 1980s. Lembcke, however, gives no credence to the possibility that veterans themselves played a role in creating the myth of antiwar spitters, or that the myth teaches us anything meaningful about the class and wartime experiences of veterans. For him, the myth is almost entirely a product of Hollywood and right-wing politicians.|$|E
5000|$|The Examined Life (1989), {{pitched to}} a broader public, explores love, death, faith, reality, {{and the meaning of}} life. According to Stephen Metcalf, Nozick expresses serious misgivings about {{capitalist}} libertarianism, {{going so far as to}} reject much of the foundations of the theory on the grounds that personal freedom can sometimes only be fully actualized via a collectivist politics and that wealth is at times justly redistributed via taxation to protect the freedom of the many from the potential tyranny of an overly selfish and powerful few. Nozick suggests that citizens who are opposed to wealth redistribution which fund programs they object to, should be able to opt out by supporting alternative government approved charities with an added 5% surcharge. [...] However, Jeff Riggenbach has noted that [...] "...in an interview conducted in July 2001, he stated that he had never stopped self-identifying as a libertarian. And Roderick Long reports that in his last book, Invariances, Nozick identified voluntary cooperation as the 'core principle' of ethics, maintaining that the duty not to interfere with another person's 'domain of choice' is 'all that any society should (coercively) demand'; higher levels of ethics, involving positive benevolence, represent instead a 'personal ideal' that should be left to 'a person's own individual choice and development.' And that certainly sounds like an attempt to embrace libertarianism all over again. <b>My</b> <b>own</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> that Nozick's thinking about these matters evolved over time and that what he wrote at any given time was an accurate reflection of what he was thinking at that time." ...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{significant}} international and feminist debate at present about prostitution and consent. However, most authors have argued that consent to prostitution is impossible. For radical feminists this is because prostitution is always a coercive sexual practice. Others simply suggest that economic coercion makes the sexual consent of sex workers highly problematic if not impossible. In <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>view,</b> it <b>is</b> usually more appropriate to talk about prostitution {{in the realm of}} work rather than sexuality. In the realm of work there is a general lack of freedom and choice for most workers, that is it is a realm of 2 ̆ 7 normal 2 ̆ 7 economic coercion. So why would we want to treat sex work as a special case and insist on the particular relevance of the language of choice and consent in this area? However, there are some important reasons to reconsider this position. In particular, when sex workers get raped (by their clients, employers, pimps or others) it is important that their claims can be made visible in the criminal justice system. If the consent and non-consent of sex workers is deemed irrelevant or impossible, then {{they are going to be}} even less able than other women to pursue complaints of rape.

In the same essay, Card clarified his position, writing: The goal of the polity is not to put homosexuals in jail. The goal is to discourage people from engaging in homosexual practices in the first place, and, when they nevertheless proceed in their homosexual behavior, {{to encourage them to}} do so discreetly, so as not shake the confidence of the community in polity's ability to provide rules for safe, dependable marriage and family relationships. In May 2013 Card further wrote that since the US Supreme Court had ruled those laws unconstitutional in 2003, he has [...] "no interest in criminalizing homosexual acts". Responding to public criticism of the 1990 essay, Card noted: Oddly enough, even as I am attacked by some as a homophobe, I am attacked by others as being too supportive of homosexuality, simply because I cannot see individual homosexuals, in or out of my books, as anything other than human beings with as complex a combination of good and evil in them as I find within myself.
