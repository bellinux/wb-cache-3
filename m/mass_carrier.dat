40|$|Developments in DNA {{technology}} {{have resulted in}} a dramatic {{increase in the number of}} genes identified. With the localisation of a gene it is possible to devise procedures suitable for <b>mass</b> <b>carrier</b> screening programmes. Until recently <b>mass</b> <b>carrier</b> screening was only possible for a limited number of disorders, for example, Tay-Sachs disease and haemoglobinopathies. Counselling possible carriers was based on estimations of risk. The momentum towards <b>mass</b> <b>carrier</b> screening is likely to be increased by gene therapy. Carrier screening for cystic fibrosis alone will have dramatic implications for genetic service provision as 4 to 5 % of the UK population carry the CF gene. The potential for genetic screening of multifactorial diseases, for example, cancers, should also be considered. The existing organisation of genetic services is likely to be inadequate. A new specialty of clinical population genetics is required.

40|$|When {{a current}} flows in a conductor, the {{electron}} wind can cause atoms to diffuse. This paper considers {{the consequences of}} such diffusion along dislocation cores. A dislocation climbing in a crystal {{is viewed as a}} non-equilibrium thermodynamic system to define the force that drives self-diffusion along the core. Not only is a dislocation a mass-transport pipe, it also climbs and generates more dislocations—all in the electron wind. A prismatic loop climbs like a rigid disk, as atoms electro-migrate along the core from one edge of the loop to the other. Each loop is therefore a <b>mass</b> <b>carrier</b> responding to an electric current. Interstitial and vacancy loops can be simultaneously generated and subsequently climb in the opposite directions. The process can transport mass in single crystal or bamboo-like interconnects at moderate temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Mass spectrometric {{analysis}} of the low-molecular weight (LMW) range of the serum/plasma proteome is revealing the existence {{of large numbers of}} previously unknown peptides and protein fragments predicted to be derived from low- abundance proteins. This raises the question of why such low abundance molecules would be retained at detectable levels in the circulation, instead of being rapidly cleared and excreted. Theoretical models of biomarker production and association with serum carrier proteins have been developed to elucidate the mechanisms governing biomarker half-life in the bloodstream. These models predict {{that the vast majority of}} LMW biomarkers exist in association with circulating high molecular <b>mass</b> <b>carrier</b> proteins. Moreover, the total serum/ plasma concentration of the biomarker is largely determined by the clearance rate of the carrier protein, not the free-phase biomarker clearance itself. These predictions have been verified experimentally using molecular mass fractionation of human serum before mass spectrometry sequence analysis. These principles have profound implications for biomarker discovery and measurement...|$|E

These wood-templated SiO 2 samples, having special hierarchical pore sizes from 3. 3 nm up to 50 μm, were obtained with SC-CO 2 precursor solution by a wood-silication method. For this method, the precursor, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), was dissolved in SC-CO 2 and impregnated into poplar tissue cells using SC-CO 2 as a <b>mass</b> <b>carrier.</b> After {{removal of the}} wood template by calcination in air at suitable temperatures, the porous silica was obtained.

40|$|Hybrid perovskites (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} novel materials for solar harvesting. Toxicity of lead (Pb), however, has always remained a concern. We investigated the electronic structure of complete replacement of Pb by alkaline earths (Ca, Sr, Ba) and found it to be wide band gapped (Eg) semiconductors (band gap 3. 7 to 4. 0 eV), and hence not suitable as absorber material. This opens up a new avenue to explore these materials as transparent conductor (TC). We doped CH 3 NH 3 BaI 3 (largest Eg) with La, which shifts its Fermi level (EF) at conduction band bottom and induces states at EF for conduction. This is precisely what is required for a transparent conductor. Optical and transport properties simulated from linear response (within Density Functional Theory (DFT)) calculations suggested it to be a very good TC material with a high figure of merit (σ/α), where σ is the electrical conductivity and α is the optical absorption coefficient. This claim is also supported by our calculated results on density of states at EF, effective <b>mass,</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration etc. at various La-doping.

Our simulations show that <b>carrier</b> effective <b>masses</b> in blue P are more sensitive to strain applied in both zigzag and armchair directions. Blue P is more responsive in strain engineering for n-MOS and p-MOS.

40|$|We {{examine and}} {{identify}} magnetoresistance mechanisms in 2 D system containing a sizable concentration of magnetic ions. We argue {{that some of}} these mechanisms can serve as a tool to measure spin polarization. Lack of spin degeneracy and enhanced localization make it possible to detect an additional QHE plateau associated with extended states floating-up in vanishing magnetic field. In diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS), owing to the strong s-d exchange between the effective <b>mass</b> <b>carriers</b> and the localized Mn spins, a high degree of spin-polarization of the carrier liquid can be achieved in moderately strong magnetic fields [1]. This offers a tool to find out how properties of quantum structures evolve as a function of spin polarization. Our work extends previous transport studies of II-VI DMS low-dimensional systems [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] in two major directions.

50|$|The Japanese carriers' {{experiences}} off China {{had helped}} further develop the IJN's carrier doctrine. One lesson learned in China was {{the importance of}} concentration and mass in projecting naval air power ashore. Therefore, in April 1941 the IJN formed the First Air Fleet to combine all of its fleet carriers under a single command. On 10 April 1941 Kaga {{was assigned to the}} First Carrier Division with Akagi as part of the new carrier fleet, which also included the Second and Fifth carrier divisions. The IJN centered its doctrine on air strikes that combined the air groups within carrier divisions, rather than each individual carrier. When more than one carrier division was operating together, the divisions' air groups were combined with each other. This doctrine of combined, <b>massed,</b> <b>carrier</b> air attack groups was the most advanced of its kind of all the world's navies. The IJN, however, remained concerned that concentrating all of its carriers together would render them vulnerable to being wiped out all at once by a massive enemy air or surface strike. Thus, the IJN developed a compromise solution in which the fleet carriers would operate closely together within their carrier divisions but the divisions themselves would operate in loose rectangular formations, with approximately 7000 m separating the carriers from each other.|$|R
