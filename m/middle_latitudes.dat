5|$|The {{commonly}} used Köppen climate classification system has five broad groups (humid tropics, arid, humid <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes,</b> continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.

5|$|Together {{with the}} trade winds, the {{westerlies}} enabled a round-trip trade route for sailing ships crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as the westerlies {{lead to the}} development of strong ocean currents on the western sides of oceans in both hemispheres through the process of western intensification. These western ocean currents transport warm, sub tropical water polewards toward the polar regions. The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes</b> to cause the flow pattern to amplify, which slows the winds down. The strongest westerly winds in the <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes</b> are within a band known as the Roaring Forties, between 40 and 50degrees latitude south of the equator. The Westerlies {{play an important role in}} carrying the warm, equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents, especially in the southern hemisphere because of its vast oceanic expanse.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopod fossils {{have been}} useful {{indicators}} of climate changes during the Paleozoic era. When global temperatures were low, {{as in much}} of the Ordovician, the large difference in temperature between equator and poles created different collections of fossils at different latitudes. On the other hand, warmer periods, such much of the Silurian, created smaller difference in temperatures, and all seas at the low to <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes</b> were colonized by the same few brachiopod species.|$|E
5|$|An oceanic (or maritime) {{climate is}} {{typically}} found {{along the west}} coasts at the <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes</b> of all the world's continents, bordering cool oceans, as well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round. The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. A steppe is a dry grassland. Subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical cyclones, {{sometimes}} called mid-latitude cyclones or wave cyclones, are low-pressure areas which, {{along with the}} anticyclones of high-pressure areas, drive the weather {{over much of the}} Earth. Extratropical cyclones are capable of producing anything from cloudiness and mild showers to heavy gales, thunderstorms, blizzards, and tornadoes. These types of cyclones are defined as large scale (synoptic) low pressure weather systems that occur in the <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes</b> of the Earth. In contrast with tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones produce rapid changes in temperature and dew point along broad lines, called weather fronts, about the center of the cyclone.|$|E

40|$|In this report, the {{significant}} oceanographic factors influencing spatial-distributions for bigeye tuna {{species in the}} Indian Ocean were investigated {{on the basis of}} the data collected and accumulated in the past years. The results show that bigeye tuna are distributed in water with the optimum temperature in a range of 10 ? C- 16 ? C irrespective of their sexual maturity and water mass. Accordingly, the vertical distribution of tuna is predicted by the temperature profile; the tunas are only found in the deeper layer in the tropical region while they are distributed up to the shallower layer in the <b>middle</b> <b>latitude.</b> On the other hand, the bigeye tuna reaching the maturity is found only beneath the layer between 0 and 50 m where the sea water temperature exceeds 26 ?C. The size of fishing ground in the tropical region decreases during the period between June and September. This decrease coincides with the decrease in sea area where the water temperature in the layer above 50 m is warmer than 26 ? C During this period, however, the size of the fishing ground in the <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> increases. Accordingly, the bigeye tunas in the <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> are younger and in the growing stage while those reaching maturity are dominate in the tropical region, and this bigeye tuna distribution is dependent on the vertical temperature profile of each sea area...|$|R
5|$|The Westerlies or the Prevailing Westerlies are the {{prevailing}} winds in the <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes</b> between 35 and 65degrees latitude. These prevailing winds blow {{from the west}} to the east, and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, and weakest {{during the summer and}} when pressures are higher over the poles.|$|E
5|$|Beetle fossils are {{abundant}} in the Cenozoic; by the Quaternary (up to 1.6 mya), fossil species are identical to living ones, while from the Late Miocene (5.7 mya) the fossils are still so close to modern forms that they are most likely the ancestors of living species. The large oscillations in climate during the Quaternary caused beetles to change their geographic distributions so much that current location gives little clue to the biogeographical history of a species. It is evident that geographic isolation of populations must often have been broken as insects moved {{under the influence of}} changing climate, causing mixing of gene pools, rapid evolution, and extinctions, especially in <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{westerlies}} {{explain why}} coastal North America {{tends to be}} wet, especially from Northern California to Alaska, during the winter. Differential heating from the sun between the land which is quite cool and the ocean which is relatively warm causes areas of low pressure to develop over land. This results in moisture rich air from the Pacific Ocean to flow from the west, resulting in frequent rainstorms and wind on the coast. This moisture continues to flow eastward until orographic lift caused by the Coast, Cascade, Columbia and Rocky Mountains cause a rain shadow effect which limits further penetration of these systems and associated rainfall eastward. This trend reverses in the summer when strong heating of the land causes high pressure and tends to block moisture-rich air from the Pacific from reaching land. This explains why most of coastal North America in the <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes</b> experiences dry summers, despite abundant rainfall in the winter.|$|E
50|$|The Köppen climate {{classification}} {{system has been}} further modified, within the Trewartha climate {{classification system}} in the middle 1960s (revised in 1980).

30|$|It is {{well known}} that the primary {{formation}} mechanisms of ionospheric disturbances are due to the variations in the electric fields and in the thermospheric parameters. According to the pioneering work by Mayr and Volland (1973), the <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> positive ionospheric disturbances are formed by the meridional component of the thermospheric wind, and the negative disturbances are due to the thermosphere composition variations.|$|R
5|$|The United States has {{the most}} tornadoes of any country, nearly four times more than {{estimated}} in all of Europe, excluding waterspouts. This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a large continent that extends from the tropics north into arctic areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes,</b> where most tornadoes of the world occur, the Rocky Mountains block moisture and buckle the atmospheric flow, forcing drier air at mid-levels of the troposphere due to downsloped winds, and causing {{the formation of a}} low pressure area downwind to the east of the mountains. Increased westerly flow off the Rockies force the formation of a dry line when the flow aloft is strong, while the Gulf of Mexico fuels abundant low-level moisture in the southerly flow to its east. This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms throughout the year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the central United States known as Tornado Alley. This area extends into Canada, particularly Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, although southeast Quebec, the interior of British Columbia, and western New Brunswick are also tornado-prone. Tornadoes also occur across northeastern Mexico.|$|E

40|$|Calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphic {{studies are}} {{presented}} from 11 sedimentary sections, nine located in theMediterranean area and one each from the <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> North and South Atlantic, respectively. The distribution patterns of middle to late Eocene calcareous nannofossils are studied {{by means of}} quantitative and semiquantitative methods. Our main goal was to test the biostratigraphic reproducibility of bioevents used in two classical standard biozonations, and to introduce new biostratigraphically useful biohorizons, resulting {{in a series of}} new <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> biostratigraphic events. The new zonal scheme substantially improves the available biochronologic resolution, doubling the current partioning based on the classical standard zonations. This study extends the terminal Eocene and Oligocene calcareous nannofossil zonal scheme proposed for the Mediterranean area (Catanzariti et al. 1997), into the middle Eocene. New age estimates are provided, which highlight the need to revise the present middle-late Eocene calcareous nannofossil biochronology.

40|$|Varying {{patterns}} of plant community diversity along geographical gradients {{are a significant}} topic in biodiversity research. Here, to explore the integrated effects of latitude and altitude on the plant community diversity in a mountainous ecosystem, we set Guancen Mountain in the northern section, Guandi Mountain in the middle section, and Wulu Mountain in the southern section of the Lvliang Mountains as study areas, and the plant community diversity (basal diameter and height of tree and species diversity indices of shrub and herb) was measured horizontally at different latitude gradients and vertically at different altitude gradients in late July 2015. The results showed that (1) the trees were taller and wider at the <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> and higher altitude with a stronger spatial heterogeneity in the structures along the latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. The evergreen tree growth preceded that of the deciduous trees in the higher latitude and lower altitude regions, whereas the deciduous tree growth preceded that of the evergreen trees in the <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> and higher altitude regions. (2) Shrubs and herbs tended to grow well in the lower latitude and middle-lower altitude regions. The shrubs had a larger species diversity at lower latitude and lower altitude, but the species diversity of the herbs was not sensitive to the influences of the latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. With the latitude and altitude increasing, perennial herbs tended to grow well at higher latitude and higher altitude, while annual herbs tended to thrive at the <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> and lower altitude. In conclusion, environmental deviations caused by latitudinal and altitudinal gradients had great influences on the spatial distributions of the plant community diversity in the Lvliang Mountains...|$|R

25|$|Despite the {{potential}} diversity of climates in the ET category involving precipitation, extreme temperatures, and relative {{wet and dry}} seasons, this category is rarely subdivided. Rainfall and snowfall are generally slight due to the low vapor pressure {{of water in the}} chilly atmosphere, but as a rule potential evapotranspiration is extremely low, allowing soggy terrain of swamps and bogs even in places that get precipitation typical of deserts of lower and <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes.</b> The amount of native tundra biomass depends more on the local temperature than the amount of precipitation.|$|E
25|$|The {{eruption}} had {{a significant}} effect on ozone levels in the atmosphere, causing a large increase in the destruction rate of ozone. Ozone levels at <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes</b> reached their lowest recorded levels, while in the southern hemisphere winter of 1992, the ozone hole over Antarctica reached its largest ever size until then, with the fastest recorded ozone depletion rates. The eruption of Mount Hudson in Chile in August 1991 also contributed to southern hemisphere ozone destruction, with measurements showing a sharp decrease in ozone levels at the tropopause when the aerosol clouds from Pinatubo and Hudson arrived.|$|E
25|$|It is more {{accurate}} to speak of ozone depletion in <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes</b> rather than holes. Total column ozone declined below pre-1980 values between 1980 and 1996 for mid-latitudes. In the northern mid-latitudes, it then increased from the minimum value by about two percent from 1996 to 2009 as regulations took effect {{and the amount of}} chlorine in the stratosphere decreased. In the Southern Hemisphere's mid-latitudes, total ozone remained constant over that time period. There are no significant trends in the tropics, largely because halogen-containing compounds have not had time to break down and release chlorine and bromine atoms at tropical latitudes.|$|E

40|$|The {{interplay between}} {{convective}} processes and the stabilizing effects of largescale systems remains debated, especially for warmer climates. We study sets of simulations {{of past and}} present climates in which carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations vary over a wide range: from pre-industrial era levels of 280 ppm to an exceedingly high value of 8960 ppm. This allows us to assess the importance of convective processes relative to <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> thermal stratification and changes to the general circulation in progressively warmer climate states. As a tool to assess the stability of the atmosphere, we calculate a thermodynamic variable called saturation potential vorticity (P*), which has the property of being identically zero wherever lapse rates are neutral with respect to moist convection, and large where lapse rates are stable. Using P* allows us to examine convective motions arising from both gravitational accelerations as well as symmetric instabilities. We assess the ability of current models (of varying spectral resolutions) in resolving conditions unstable to slantwise convection. We show that the coarse resolution reanalysis data captures instances of observed slantwise convection. Our results show examples of vertically stable lapse rates, while being conditionally unstable along slanted angular momentum surfaces. This suggests the need for model parameterizations of convection to include instabilities arising from symmetric displacements. Tropical regions are neutral with respect to moist convection while higher latitudes most often have stable lapse rates, especially during the winter months. In the warmer climate simulations, the frequency of convectively neutral air masses increases in both <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> and polar regions, especially during the summer months. These simulations also show expansion of the Hadley cell and shifting of <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> storm tracks. Using Maximum Potential Intensity (MPI) as a tool to assess the upper bound of hurricane strength, we show sustainment of intense tropical cyclones in regions they cannot in our present climate...|$|R
25|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Uranus is calm {{compared to those}} of other giant planets. Only a limited number of small bright clouds at <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes</b> in both hemispheres and one Uranus Dark Spot have been observed since 1986. One of those bright cloud features, located at −34° of latitude and called Berg, probably existed continuously since at least 1986. Nevertheless, the Uranian atmosphere has rather strong zonal winds blowing in the retrograde (counter to the rotation) direction near the equator, but switching to the prograde direction poleward of ±20° latitude. The wind speeds are from −50 to −100m/s at the equator increasing up to 240m/s near 50° latitude. The wind profile measured before the equinox of 2007 was slightly asymmetric with winds stronger in the southern hemisphere, although {{it turned out to be}} a seasonal effect as this hemisphere was continuously illuminated by the Sun before 2007. After 2007 winds in the northern hemisphere accelerated while those in the southern one slowed down.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} {{forests of}} spruce, fir, pine, and larch, collectively {{known as the}} taiga, made up the largest natural zone of the Soviet Union, an area {{about the size of}} the United States. Here too the winter is long and severe, as witnessed by the routine registering of the world's coldest temperatures for inhabited areas in the northeastern portion of this belt. The taiga zone extended in a broad band across the <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes,</b> stretching from the Finnish border in the west to the Verkhoyansk Range in northeastern Siberia and as far south as the southern shores of Lake Baykal. Isolated sections of taiga are found along mountain ranges, as in the southern part of the Urals, and in the Amur River Valley in the Far East. About 33 percent of the population lives in this zone, which, with the mixed forest zone, included most of the European part of the Soviet Union and the ancestral lands of the earliest Slavic settlers.|$|E
25|$|Intense {{columns of}} Auroral {{ionization}} at 100km altitudes within the auroral oval backscatter radio waves, including those on HF and VHF. Backscatter is angle-sensitive—incident ray vs. magnetic field {{line of the}} column must be very close to right-angle. Random motions of electrons spiraling around the field lines create a Doppler-spread that broadens the spectra of the emission to more or less noise-likedepending on how high radio frequency is used. The radio-auroras are observed mostly at high latitudes and rarely extend down to <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes.</b> The occurrence of radio-auroras depends on solar activity (flares, coronal holes, CMEs) and annually the events are more numerous during solar cycle maxima. Radio aurora includes the so-called afternoon radio aurora which produces stronger but more distorted signals and after the Harang-minima, the late-night radio aurora (sub-storming phase) returns with variable signal strength and lesser doppler spread. The propagation range for this predominantly back-scatter mode extends up to about 2000km in east-west plane, but strongest signals are observed most frequently from the north at nearby sites on same latitudes.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{study of}} a weather {{phenomenon}} was carried out, where inter-action between <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> and tropical waves had occurred. The goal {{of this study was}} to simulate the interaction using a numerical model. The phe-nomenon occurred under winter synoptic regime and could lead to wide spread showers over a band that cover most of the kingdom. A detailed synoptic de-scription of a case, where the interaction had occurred over west Africa, was discussed. It was shown that the invasion of cold air to the south of 30 ºN was a necessary trigger action for such interaction. In this case a south wind com-ponent was developed due to air mass thermal differences. The developed wind component caused a change in the direction of the subtropical jet from westerly to south-west. This caused northerly advection of moist air from the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) where deep convective cells existed. When a polar frontal system passed through the subtropical region and came in phase with the axis of the advected moisture tongue, rapid development of the system had occurred. In this case an active cloud band was formed and ex-tended from the tropics to the <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> wave. 1...|$|R
