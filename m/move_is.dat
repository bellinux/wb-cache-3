5|$|Bughouse {{is usually}} played using clock move, which allows {{touching}} of pieces. A <b>move</b> <b>is</b> completed {{only when the}} clock is pressed. Touch <b>move</b> <b>is</b> practiced to a lesser extent. When used, it applies to pieces in reserve as well; they are considered dropped after contact has been made with an empty square.|$|E
5|$|Checkmate: The player whose turn {{it is to}} <b>move</b> <b>is</b> {{in check}} and has no legal move to escape check.|$|E
5|$|Zugzwang, disadvantageous {{since it}} forces {{a player to}} <b>move,</b> <b>is</b> often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game. In the example diagram, either side having the <b>move</b> <b>is</b> in zugzwang: Black to move must play 1...Kb7 {{allowing}} White to promote the pawn after 2.Kd7; White to move must permit a draw, either by 1.Kc6 stalemate or by losing the pawn after any other legal move.|$|E
50|$|The <b>move</b> <b>was</b> {{planned to}} {{have been done in}} 2014, but after {{construction}} delays the <b>move</b> <b>was</b> delayed by three years, to 2017.|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 2013-2014 season, Crawford <b>was</b> linked a <b>move</b> to Cove Rangers {{after the}} <b>move</b> <b>was</b> agreed. However, the <b>move</b> <b>was</b> broken down for unknown circumstances.|$|R
50|$|During matches, wrestlers {{take turns}} attacking. <b>Moves</b> <b>are</b> {{selected}} via a menu {{and can be}} used in combos. Powerful special <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> also available and can be executed through quick time events.|$|R
5|$|If {{a player}} moves a pawn to its eighth rank, it cannot be {{substituted}} for a different move of the pawn when the player has stopped touching it. However, the <b>move</b> <b>is</b> not complete until the promoted piece is released on that square.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Nebraska lawmakers moved Offutt Air Force Base and {{the town}} of Bellevue — an area with a large {{minority}} population — out of the Omaha-based 2nd District and shifted in the Republican-heavy Omaha suburbs in Sarpy County. The <b>move</b> <b>is</b> expected to dilute the city's urban Democratic vote.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, the Museum of London {{revealed}} {{plans to}} vacate its Barbican site {{and move into}} the General Market Building. The cost of the <b>move</b> <b>is</b> estimated {{to be in the}} region of £70 million and, if funding can be achieved, would be complete by 2021.|$|E
5000|$|An Intermediate lesson, {{involving}} a routine of 3 moves {{drawn from a}} much larger repertoire of Intermediate-level moves, and lasting approximately 45 minutes. At {{least one of the}} Intermediate <b>moves</b> will <b>be</b> a Classic <b>move</b> which <b>is</b> intended for new Intermediate dancers. Many of the harder Intermediate <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> based around these Classic <b>moves.</b> There <b>are</b> 24 Classic <b>moves.</b> [...] Individual teachers are less constrained as to the content of the intermediate-level lesson. Intermediate <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> more complex and may contain footwork.|$|R
5000|$|On July 17 {{parliament}} {{approved a}} major cabinet reshuffle. The <b>move</b> <b>was</b> to [...] "optimize the government's work" [...] according to foreign minister Solomon Passy. The <b>move</b> <b>was</b> announced {{against the backdrop}} of sliding approval ratings.|$|R
25|$|With {{the side}} with the queen to <b>move,</b> checkmate can <b>be</b> forced in at most ten moves from any {{starting}} position, with optimal play by both sides, but usually fewer <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> required. In positions in which a pawn has just promoted to a queen, at most nine <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> required.|$|R
5|$|The diagram {{shows an}} example checkmate position. The white king is {{threatened}} by the black queen; the square to which the king could <b>move</b> <b>is</b> also threatened; it cannot capture the queen, because it would then be in check by the rook.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{automatically}} a draw if the player to <b>move</b> <b>is</b> not in check {{but has no}} legal move. This situation is called a stalemate. An {{example of such a}} position is shown in the adjacent diagram.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the company}} sells beer at the Whopper Bar locations, {{including}} Budweiser, Bud Light, and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed {{to target the}} important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because the company {{is known as a}} fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the <b>move</b> <b>is</b> timely because the company is growing with its aging customer base.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> {{frequently}} used in Lindy Hop. This {{is also used}} as a warm up before Lindy Hop classes. Note that the <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> very 8-count centered, like tap dance. That is, they almostall start on count 8.|$|R
50|$|For {{the most}} part, other <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> the Closed Sicilian. Possible <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> 3.g3 and 3.f4 in general, also 3.Nge2, and less {{commonly}} 3.d3 and 3.Bc4. Some lines may transpose to the Open Sicilian, {{but there are}} many that do not.|$|R
50|$|If ever three 6's are {{rolled in}} a row, {{the last piece}} <b>moved</b> <b>is</b> killed and {{returned}} to the nest. If the last piece <b>moved</b> <b>was</b> in the final coloured ramp, it <b>is</b> only <b>moved</b> to the bottom of it.|$|R
5|$|Another aspect {{introduced}} in the game is the Dimension Link (D-Link), measured in a blue gauge on the interface. It is used to draw power from certain companions who the player characters meet during the game, such as Experiment 626, temporarily replacing the commands in the player's customized command deck with a pre-determined set of commands that differ with each D-Link. Once the command gauge is filled while performing a D-Link, a powerful finishing <b>move</b> <b>is</b> activated to take out enemies. Each finishing move has two levels which can render a finishing move more powerful than before, {{similar to that of}} the Command System. The D-Link can only be used when its corresponding gauge is filled completely, and can be activated by pressing right on the directional pad to access the D-Link menu, followed by selecting the chosen ally.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{travelled}} from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, {{accompanied by}} a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, he was treated with respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he {{was treated as a}} government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further <b>move</b> <b>is</b> also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.|$|E
5|$|Exceptions {{to these}} naming {{patterns}} {{are found in}} languages that designate the move by making reference to a location, such as the Norwegian brassespark (Brazilian kick). This exception is most significant in Spanish, where a fierce controversy exists between Chile and Peru—as part of their historic sports rivalry—over the naming of the bicycle kick; Chileans know it as the chilenita, while Peruvians call it the chalaca. Regardless, the <b>move</b> <b>is</b> also known in Spanish by the less tendentious names of tijera and tijereta—both {{a reference to the}} manoeuvre's scissor-like motion.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the mechanics of extracting blocks from a tower of stacked blocks {{in the game of}} Jenga is presented. Translational and rotational <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> analyzed for the likelihood of disturbing other blocks in the tower, with an aim to determine <b>moves</b> which <b>are</b> safe from disturbing other blocks and are robust against change in outcome with different block configurations. Optimal <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> found using translational <b>moves</b> which <b>are</b> robust against tower configurations and keep the tower undisturbed. ...|$|R

5|$|For {{many years}} Burger King has sold beer {{in several of}} its {{international}} locations, such as Germany, but not in its home territory. The company began to sell beer at its BK Whopper Bar limited service concept restaurants in Miami, New York, and Los Angeles in 2010. The company is selling products from SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch, including Budweiser, Bud Lite, and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because the company {{is known as a}} fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller.

5|$|<b>Move</b> <b>is</b> {{the tenth}} studio album by Christian rock band Third Day. Released on October 19, 2010, {{the album was}} the band's first after guitarist Brad Avery left Third Day. The band wanted the album to be a {{departure}} from the modern rock stylings of Revelation (2008), intending to show more of their southern rock roots. Third Day chose to work with producer Paul Moak on the album and recorded it at their own studio, feeling it offered them more creative freedom. Primarily a southern rock album, Move also has significant influence from gospel music.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation <b>Move</b> <b>is</b> a motion-sensing game {{controller}} {{platform for the}} PlayStation 3 video game console by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). Based on the handheld motion controller wand, PlayStation Move uses the PlayStation Eye webcam to track the wand's position and the inertial sensors in the wand to detect its motion. First revealed on June 2, 2009, PlayStation Move was launched in Q3/Q4 2010. Hardware available at launch included the main PlayStation Move motion controller and an optional PlayStation Move sub-controller.|$|E

5|$|After 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz {{variation}} 3...Ne4 which {{concentrates on}} the rapid development of pieces, but the most common <b>move</b> <b>is</b> 3...Ng4 with three main possibilities for White. The Adler variation 4.Nf3 sees White seeking a spatial advantage in the centre with his pieces, notably the important d5-square. The Alekhine variation 4.e4 gives White an important spatial advantage and a strong pawn centre. The Rubinstein variation 4.Bf4 leads to an important choice for White, after 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+, between 6.Nbd2 and 6.Nc3. The reply 6.Nbd2 brings a positional game in which White enjoys the bishop pair and tries to break through on the queenside, while 6.Nc3 keeps the material advantage of a pawn {{at the cost of}} a weakening of the white pawn structure. Black usually looks to have an aggressive game (many lines can shock opponents that do not know the theory) or cripple White's pawn structure.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} main lines 4.Bf4, 4.Nf3 and 4.e4, the only {{significant}} other fourth <b>move</b> <b>is</b> 4.e3 to continue by 4...Nxe5 5.Nh3 (or the other move-order 4.Nh3 and 5.e3) so that the white knight starts the journey Ng1–h3–f4–d5 reach its ideal d5-square. The idea with 4.e3 and 5.Nh3 was favorite of a leading Soviet coach and writer Mikhail Shereshevsky, who wrote in his 1994 book The Soviet Chess Conveyor that the line was first shown to him by a strong correspondence player Donatas Lapienis. Black has tried to prevent White's idea by the suitably strange-looking move 5...Ng6, taking the f4-square from the Nh3. Then White can develop along various setups, the most active being 6.Qh5 with the possibility Nh3–g5 in store to recycle the knight towards a more central position. Black can also ignore White's intentions and concentrate on his own play by placing the Nb8 on c5, {{in order to put}} pressure on the d3-square. After 5...g6 6.Nf4Bg7 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 d6 9.Nc3 Nbd7 10.Qd2 a5 11.b3 Nc5 the position of Black's knights is secured and Black's position is similar to the Leningrad variation of the Dutch Defence (once he has played f7–f5). White has no reason, however, to abandon the a1–h8 diagonal to Black, and he can try 5...g6 6.Bd2 d6 7.Nf4 Bg7 8.Bc3 0-0 9.Be2 Nbd7 10.Nd2 b6 and in one game White gained a minimal edge.|$|E
5|$|During exploration, the Prince navigates areas {{filled with}} traps: these traps include spike pits, arrow traps, {{wall-mounted}} blades and saws, and spinning spiked stakes. The Prince's main contextual <b>move</b> <b>is</b> wall-running, an action where he runs up onto and along a wall {{for a set}} distance, either to land on or jump off to a platform. The Prince's other acrobatic abilities include climbing along and across ledges, walking along beams, swinging on and jumping from poles, jumping onto and between pillars, and swinging on ropes. Large environmental puzzles are encountered during the Prince's journey, extending across multiple areas in large rooms. Many puzzles are cooperative, requiring Farah's help to complete them. In combat, the Prince fights monsters created by the Sands infecting the Palace's inhabitants. A single command contextually triggered different moves depending on position and directional movement, while other special moves such as a somersault attack and bouncing off walls into enemies require additional commands. Enemies can only be killed by stabbing them with the Dagger of Time, which gathers up the Sands inside them.|$|E
