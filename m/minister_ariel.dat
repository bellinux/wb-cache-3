25|$|According to Avi Shlaim, {{the real}} {{driving force behind}} the Israeli {{invasion}} to Lebanon was the defense <b>minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon.

The second aim was the establishment of the Maronite government in Lebanon, headed by Bashir Gemayel and signing the peace treaty between two countries, the third aim was the expelling of the Syrian Army from Lebanon.

In 2002, after the Israeli Labor Party left the coalition and vacated the position of foreign minister, Prime <b>Minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon appointed Netanyahu as Foreign Minister. Netanyahu challenged Sharon for the leadership of the Likud party, but failed to oust Sharon.|$|E
