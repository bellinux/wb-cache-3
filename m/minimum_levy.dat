Analysis of the portfolio characteristics for each reveals the level of integration with South Africa using optimised portfolio frontiers. In addition, the implications of adopting a <b>minimum</b> investment retention <b>levy</b> by the smaller states is examined. Namibia is found to exhibit the greatest degree of integration with South Africa, followed to a much lesser extent by Swaziland with Mozambique. The evidence suggests that investors in the smaller markets would face considerable additional costs should such a policy be adopted. © 2008 The Author.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Educational leadership and policy analysis. State school finance systems have typically required some local tax effort to determine how to dole out state funds to provide equitable and adequate educational opportunities for K- 12 students. As state-level systems have moved away from tax-driven formulas to student needs, local revenue requirements remain. However, no study has examined the potential links between a family, community and economic risk factors that affect a student's educational opportunity and local taxation choices. This study focuses on school district taxation choices before and during the implementation of Missouri's 1993 tax-rate driven formula. The tax-rate formula required a <b>minimum</b> incentive <b>levy</b> of $ 2. 75 per $ 100 of assessed valuation, and this study shows school district voters responded. Previously, some groups had effects on district taxation who subsequently lost the ability to affect local taxation levels under a tax-rate driven formula. These links between community, family and economic risk factors and the state's local revenue requirements are crucially important to the success of achieving equitable and adequate fund distribution and merit further research and policy recommendations...|$|R
40|$|Do small {{businesses}} change their hiring and employment practices {{in response to}} an increase in the <b>minimum</b> wage? The <b>Levy</b> Institute conducts a national survey of small firms in many industries to find out. It has long been the conventional wisdom that an {{increase in the minimum wage}} results in lower employment. This wisdom stems from both theoretical precepts taught in most economic textbooks and statements from employers regarding their anticipated reaction to an increase. It is also suggested that much of the opposition to the minimum wage comes from the small business community. Arguments against raising the minimum wage presume that an increase reduces profits for {{small businesses}} and forces them to lay workers off. There is little empirical evidence measuring the actual responses of small businesses to changes in the minimum wage. What is available is anecdotal evidence, the results of a few studies by academics on the effects of the minimum wage on the teen labor market, and the predictions of the minimum wage study commission that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage might result in a 1 percent reduction in teen employment (Kosters and Welc...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} several indicators {{to measure}} the extent and depth of rules governing international migration. It {{is set in the}} context of moves towards further liberalisation of services trade and associated labour mobility (Mode 4) under GATS and related regional trading arrangements. Ten Southeast Asian countries at various stages of economic development are examined as a case study, with special reference to health care and information technology. These sectors are priority sectors for regional cooperation in services trade in ASEAN, but were expected to represent opposite extremes in terms of the regulation of migration. The study finds that the more advanced countries tend to have more liberal regimes for international movements of skilled manpower, although there were smaller differences regarding general visa and work permit arrangements. Generic restrictions on mobility were related to trade policies, as well as to direct barriers (often country-specific) to migration. They included <b>minimum</b> salary requirement, <b>levies</b> on foreign workers, economic needs tests, and limitations related to language, education and job experience. Controls were more extensive in the health care sector, related to social considerations as well as professional organisational interests.

40|$|For ten years, the National Bargaining Council for the Clothing Manufacturing Industry (NBC) {{has been}} used by the South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union (Sactwu) and by largely Cape Town-based {{employers}} to impose higher labour costs on 'Chinese' employers in Newcastle, in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Many Newcastle employers have failed to comply with the rising <b>minimum</b> wages and <b>levies</b> imposed by the Council. The struggle intensified in 2010 / 11 when the NBC used the labour courts to put pressure on, and close down, targeted non-compliant firms, in response to which some employers initiated legal action against the Minister of Labour and the NBC. The struggle between the NBC and non-compliant firms is of broader importance because the non-compliant firms comprise the labour-intensive rump of the last remaining labour-intensive manufacturing sector in South Africa. Their fate draws our attention to the role of labour market policies and institutions (especially the process of minimum wage-setting through bargaining councils), trade liberalisation and industrial policy in determining the viability of labour-intensive manufacturing. The Newcastle case shows how, under the guise of promoting 'decent work' and the supposed levelling of the playing field for producers, an unholy coalition of a trade union, a group of employers and the state can initiate and drive a process of structural adjustment which undermines labour-intensive employment and exports South African jobs to lower-wage countries such as Lesotho and China...|$|R
40|$|From its {{establishment}} in 2002, the National Bargaining Council for the Clothing Manufacturing Industry (NBC) {{was used by}} the South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union (SACTWU) and mostly Cape Town-based employers to raise wages in lower-wage areas, including Newcastle. Rising minimum wages were agreed in the NBC, and then extended countrywide by the Minister of Labour. In Newcastle (and elsewhere), major firms shut down, whilst others failed to comply fully with the repeatedly raised <b>minimum</b> wages and <b>levies</b> imposed by the NBC. In 2010, the NBC launched a new ‘compliance drive’, using the labour courts to put pressure on, and close down, non-compliant firms, threatening at least 20, 000 jobs. The NBC also agreed further wage increases, and presented these to the Minister of Labour for extension countrywide. Newcastle employers responded by taking legal action against the Minister of Labour and the NBC. The struggle over minimum wages in areas like Newcastle is of broader importance because the non-compliant firms comprised the labour-intensive rump of the last remaining labour-intensive manufacturing sector in South Africa. The Newcastle crisis reveals starkly the tensions between labour market policies and institutions and employment. The Newcastle case shows how, under the guise of promoting ‘decent work’ for workers and the supposed levelling of the playing field for producers, an unholy coalition of a trade union, some employers and the state initiated and drove a process of structural adjustment that undermined labour-intensive employment and exported South African jobs to lower-wage countries such as Lesotho and China...|$|R
40|$|We {{sometimes}} think, loosely, that {{ethics is}} good and that therefore more is better than less. But more is not better than less, if the more exacts higher costs, {{measured in terms of}} vague rules that impose unnecessary and excessive burdens. Overly-vague ethics rules impose costs on the judicial system and the litigants, which we should weigh when determining whether to impose ill-defined and indefinite ethics prohibitions on judges. Unnecessarily imprecise ethics rules allow and tempt critics, with <b>minimum</b> effort, to <b>levy</b> a plausible and serious charge that the judge has violated the ethics rules. Overuse not only invites abuse with frivolous charges that have the patina of legitimacy, but also may eventually demean the seriousness of a charge of being unethical. The ABA is now revising its Model Code of Judicial Conduct. Most states and the federal courts follow the ABA Model Code in enacting their own judicial rules. The ABA is proposing to take what is now merely the title to a rule and make it a separate rule. Proposed Rule 1. 02 provides: A judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety. This proposed rule, however, does not really define impropriety or what is an appearance of an impropriety. Apparently, it is wrong to do something that is not wrong but appears wrong, as perceived by a reasonable person with knowledge of the circumstances to impair the judge 2 ̆ 7 s ability to carry out judicial responsibilities with independence, integrity, impartiality, and competence. But if the person really had knowledge of the circumstances, he or she would know whether the conduct was really wrong or not. Proponents of a rule that forbids judges from engaging in the appearances of impropriety argue that the rule promotes, {{in the view of the}} lay public, the integrity of the judges. On the contrary, the power to unfairly criticize a judge as violating the appearances of impropriety serves to bring the judiciary in disrepute. Granted, not all rules can be written with crystal clarity, but many can be. The phrase, appearance of impropriety certainly offers a reason why the frames drafted some rules as broadly as they did. But it is too vague to be a rule...|$|R
50|$|After Webb’s {{death on}} 28 November 1893, his wife, {{following}} her husbands’ instructions, employed as successor, John Smith-Hill, an associate {{member of the}} Surveyors Institute with a First Class Diploma from the R.A.S., and a B.Sc. Honours Degree in Botany from London University. Smith-Hill arrived at Aspatria in January 1894 to find a register of 65 scholars and a staff of ten lecturers. He began by expanding {{the scope of the}} curriculum such that within two years he had broadened its base and began to specialise in the training of managers required for the empire’s emerging estates and farms. He divided the course into three discrete sections. The first, a bridging course, designed to assist the less well educated student, to improve their knowledge in Algebra, English Composition, Book Keeping, Drawing, Arithmetic, Elementary Science and Agriculture. The second, more advanced, included Chemistry, Menstruation, Geology, Botany, Veterinary Medicine; Land Surveying and Agricultural Law. To fulfil the practicable requirements of the final section he added Practical Surveying, Beekeeping and Veterinary Surgery. He established an annual fact finding magazine entitled the College Chronicle. He employed a professional valuer, to teach the skills of property valuation. He also introduced a Mining class specifically designed for those students seeking their fortunes in foreign fields. Finally he changed the entry procedures. He discouraged girls, raised the entrance age to sixteen and introduced an entrance examination. He also increased the fees to a commercial level. By 1900, the <b>minimum</b> annual charges <b>levied</b> on students under the age of 20, was £100. Students above this age paid a surcharge of £10. In December 1896, a commendatory report appeared in the North British Agriculturist, stating that Aspatria College had more students than the combined intake of all those attending agricultural classes in Scotland & Northern England. On 4 August 1896, Smith-Hill married Webbs’ widow and became the joint owner of the College. In 1898 he established the Old Aspatrian Club, with over 60 members, which met annually in the Holborn restaurant, London and later in Carlisle. In 1902, in association with the London Meteorological office, the college established a meteorological station at Aspatria; its aim, to provide a daily district account of a variety of changing climatic conditions. After 1903 students began to specialise in the requirements of the Land Agency and students tended to concentrate on the professional Association Examination of the Surveyors Institution. In the opening two years the college experienced a 100% success rate in each corresponding examination and took the Beadel Prize for best student on both occasions. In 1904 Smith-Hill received a Gold Medal from the Surveyors Institute for a paper entitled Agricultural in Cumberland, reviewing the changes between 1850 and 1900. In 1904 when summarising the career prospects of a number of his past students; he reported that 61 continued to farm in the United Kingdom and of the remainder, 46 were pursuing work in the colonies and the Argentine; 25 were pursuing the Land agency profession; and 9 were following other occupations. He made special reference to John Goodwin, the current Director of a Demonstration Farm at Kalimpong India; and Lawrence Carpenter, the Chief of the Agricultural Office in Nairobi, East Africa. By 1909, in addition to attracting students from the British Empire, scholars were enrolling from Portugal, India, West Indies, South Africa the Middle East and Egypt. In 1914, the final year, the official returns from the Surveyors Institute indicated that of the candidates examined in that year's intake the ratio of success was 60%. However, in the case of Aspatria this figure was 100%.|$|R
