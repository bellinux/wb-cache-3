40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1, simian {{immunodeficiency virus}} and simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection generally lead {{to death of}} the host accompanied by high viraemia and profound CD 4 + T-cell depletion. SHIV clone KS 661 -infected rhesus <b>macaques</b> with a high viral load set point (HVL) ultimately experience diarrhoea and wasting at 6 – 12  months after infection. In contrast, infected <b>macaques</b> with a low viral load set point (LVL) usually live asymptomatically throughout the observation period, and are therefore referred to as asymptomatic LVL (Asym LVL) <b>macaques.</b> Interestingly, some LVL <b>macaques</b> exhibit diarrhoea and wasting similar to the symptoms of HVL <b>macaques</b> and are termed symptomatic LVL (Sym LVL) <b>macaques.</b> This study tested the hypothesis that Sym LVL <b>macaques</b> have {{the same degree of}} intestinal abnormalities as HVL <b>macaques.</b> The proviral DNA loads in lymphoid tissue and the intestines of Sym LVL and Asym LVL <b>macaques</b> were comparable and all infected monkeys showed villous atrophy. Notably, the CD 4 + cell frequencies of lymphoid tissues and intestines in Sym LVL <b>macaques</b> were remarkably lower than those in Asym LVL and uninfected <b>macaques.</b> Furthermore, Sym LVL and HVL <b>macaques</b> exhibited an increased number of activated macrophages. In conclusion, intestinal disorders including CD 4 + cell reduction and abnormal immune activation can be observed in SHIV-KS 661 -infected <b>macaques</b> independent of virus replication levels...|$|R
40|$|Simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) infection of <b>macaques</b> and human {{immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) infection of humans result in variable but generally fatal disease outcomes. Most SIV-infected <b>macaques</b> progress to AIDS {{over a period of}} 1 to 3 years, in the face of robust SIV-specific immune responses (conventional progressors [CP]). A small number of SIV-inoculated <b>macaques</b> mount transient immune responses and progress rapidly to AIDS (rapid progressors [RP]). We speculated that the underlying pathogenic mechanisms may differ between RP and CP <b>macaques.</b> We compared the pathological lesions, virus loads, and distribution of virus and target cells in SIVsmE 660 - or SIVsmE 543 -infected RP and CP rhesus <b>macaques</b> at terminal disease. RP <b>macaques</b> developed a wasting syndrome characterized by severe SIV enteropathy in the absence of opportunistic infections. In contrast, opportunistic infections were commonly observed in CP <b>macaques.</b> RP and CP <b>macaques</b> showed distinct patterns of CD 4 + T-cell depletion, with a selective loss of memory cells in RP <b>macaques</b> and a generalized (naive and memory) CD 4 depletion in CP <b>macaques.</b> In situ hybridization demonstrated higher levels of virus expression in lymphoid tissues (P < 0. 001) of RP <b>macaques</b> and a broader distribution to include many nonlymphoid tissues. Finally, SIV was preferentially expressed in macrophages in RP <b>macaques</b> whereas the primary target cells in CP <b>macaques</b> were T lymphocytes at end stage disease. These data suggest distinct pathogenic mechanisms leading to the deaths of these two groups of animals, with CP <b>macaques</b> being more representative of HIV-induced AIDS in humans...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAccording to the "social {{complexity}} hypothesis", {{social systems}} characterized by complex relationships require high communicative complexity to regulate interactions between conspecifics. In particular, we may expect that elaborated negotiation skills {{are linked to}} a high variability of acoustic structures. To investigate this issue, we compared call durations, energy quantiles, and maxima, minima, starts and ends of fundamental frequencies in two species of <b>macaques</b> differing in their social style: rhesus <b>macaques</b> (Macaca mulatta) which display a steep gradient of dominance and {{a high degree of}} nepotism, and Tonkean <b>macaques</b> (Macaca tonkeana) which exhibit balanced dominance relationships and more open kin subgroups. We recorded the tonal calls emitted by adult females in two groups of rhesus <b>macaques</b> and four groups of Tonkean <b>macaques</b> kept in captive conditions. Comparisons revealed substantial interspecific contrasts. Differences between call types appeared wider in Tonkean than in rhesus <b>macaques,</b> and a larger number of acoustic variables contributed to the delineation of types in the former than in the latter. Moreover, contrary to rhesus <b>macaques,</b> Tonkean <b>macaques</b> could utter multi-unitary calls. These results support the hypothesis that tolerant <b>macaques</b> may have more variable communication signals than their more intolerant counterparts...|$|R

At the same time that cerebral spinal fluid viral load increased in <b>macaques</b> that developed encephalitis, we observed that monocyte-derived macrophages from these <b>macaques</b> produced more virus than those from <b>macaques</b> that did not develop encephalitis. However, during the course of infection, the number of blood monocyte-associated SIV DNA copies did not distinguish <b>macaques</b> that developed simian immunodeficiency virus encephalitis from <b>macaques</b> that did not develop encephalitis.

When the disease is diagnosed in <b>macaques</b> on long-term research protocols, the treatment of choice in our facility is monthly administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) to decrease estrogen release and subsequently diminish clinical signs associated with the disease. Because hormonal fluctuations associated with the normal menstrual cycle are known to affect parameters of glucoregulatory function in rhesus <b>macaques,</b> we evaluated the effect of MPA treatment on glucoregulatory function cross-sectionally in 6 animals and longitudinally in 4 animals with endometriosis. Our hypothesis was that monthly administration of MPA for the treatment of endometriosis would negatively affect glucoregulatory function in rhesus <b>macaques.</b> We found that adult female rhesus <b>macaques</b> on MPA therapy for 1. 4 to 36. 1 mo had lower insulin sensitivity than did age- and weight-matched healthy control animals.

5|$|When {{animals are}} faced with a choice to either wait for a reward, or receive a reward right away, the {{discounting}} of the reward is hyperbolic. As the length of time of waiting for a reward increases, the reward is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time, only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging. Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting. In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, <b>macaque</b> monkeys were given the choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive, versus a more risky choice. The riskier choice would reward the monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time, and a small reward the other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky, but rather as a large, delayed reward. They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large reward as certain: if they did not get the large reward the first time around, they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay.|$|E

Both viruses were apparently apathogenic in their natural hosts but caused immunodeficiency in PT <b>macaques.</b> Infection was characterized by a progressive loss of CD 4 + lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and lymph nodes, generalized lymphoid depletion, a wasting syndrome, and opportunistic infections, such as Mycobacterium avium or Pneumocystis carinii infections. However, unlike SIVsm/mac infection of <b>macaques,</b> SIVlhoest and SIVsun infections in PT <b>macaques</b> were not accompanied by high viral loads during the chronic disease stage.
