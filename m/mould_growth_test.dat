40|$|Materials {{that are}} stored or used in damp {{conditions}} {{may be subject}} to <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> However, all materials are not equally susceptible; for each specific material, there is a critical moisture level for <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> If this is exceeded, there is a risk that mould fungi will develop on the material. This level can be determined in accelerated laboratory tests, at constant temperatures and relative humidity (RH) favourable to <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> Within a building however, these parameters are expected to vary from one part of the construction to another, and are seldom constant; there is fluctuation in temperature and RH due to seasonal or shorter-term variations. In this study, test pieces of the same materials tested in a laboratory environment were placed in three outdoor ventilated crawl spaces and three outdoor ventilated attics, where the temperature and RH varied, and <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on the <b>test</b> pieces was studied over 2. 5 years. Material-specific <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> curves were produced based on critical moisture levels, as determined in laboratory experiments under constant temperature and RH. When the actual conditions of RH and temperature exceeded these curves, there was <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on the <b>test</b> pieces if the time was sufficiently long. The conclusion from the study is that although conditions in laboratory studies are simplified and accelerated, the results serve well to indicate <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> within a building construction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{full-scale}} experimental investigation of the <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on different types of wood products used for sheathing and framing wall assemblies.

Importantly this study used full scale wall assemblies; to date <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> studies have only been performed within a laboratory on small samples of materials. Moreover, this study recreates the conditions which evidently cause <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on full scale wall assemblies. Tests were performed within a climate chamber on three wall assemblies. The scope of the study includes both the sheathing and framing components, but this paper focuses mainly on the sheathing. Results indicate that the relative humidity conditions needed for <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> to occur on wood in a reasonable time (less than several months) are higher than a surface relative humidity of 80 %RH. During the first eight weeks of one test, the conditions at the surface of the sheathing was held constant at 26 ºC and 95 %RH and little <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> was observed on the untreated sheathing and little or no <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> was seen on the borate-treated sheathing.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> resistance of different types of wood products which include the sheathing and framing within full scale wall assemblies. Secondary objectives were to investigate the difference in <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> resistance between borate-treated and untreated wood products as well as provide information about <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> under different temperature and humidity conditions for treated and untreated wood products. The objective of the study is to better understand <b>mould</b> <b>growth,</b> and to examine the effects of varying high moisture conditions on wooden products and the <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> which may result.

Results of this study indicate that the relative humidity conditions needed for <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on wood are higher than originally believed (i. e., significantly greater than 80 %RH). During the first eight weeks of test number one the relative humidity at the surface of the sheathing was held constant at 95 % and little <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> was observed on the untreated sheathing (<b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> index of 3 or less); little or no <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on the treated sheathing (<b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> index of 1 or less).

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} to <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> varies between building materials. The factors that most affect <b>mould</b> <b>growth,</b> the relative humidity (RH) and temperature also vary {{in different parts}} of buildings. One way of preventing the <b>growth</b> of <b>mould</b> in buildings is therefore to choose building materials that can withstand the expected conditions. It is thus crucial that data are available to allow the correct choices of materials to be made, especially information on the critical moisture level for <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> is needed. This is the lowest RH at which mould can grow on the building material. In this work, a variety of laboratory studies on <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on building materials at different combinations of RH and temperature were performed. Based on the results, the critical moisture level for the tested materials were determined. This made it possible to predict the propensity for <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on these materials in parts of building subject to known RH and temperature. To validate these predictions, the same materials tested in the laboratory were exposed to the conditions in three crawlspaces and three attics, with varying RH and temperature, for 2 ½ years. Good agreement was found between the predicted and observed <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> A new <b>test</b> method for determining the critical moisture level of a material was therefore developed {{based on the results of}} these studies. It was also shown that this method will make better prediction than traditional mould resistance tests, which evaluate the resistance to <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> in a “worst case scenario”, i. e. at relatively high RH and temperature. The RH and temperature in buildings fluctuate, as does the length of time that the critical mositure level is exceeded. A simplified approach, considering the cumulative time that conditions had exceeded this level gave sufficient information to validate the laboratory tests. Using this approach will not underestimate the risk of <b>mould</b> <b>growth,</b> but will include a margin of safety. However, it was also shown in this work that to make more precise predictions of the <b>mould</b> <b>growth,</b> the length of the favourable conditions of RH and temperature must also be taken into account. Test specimens of wood were exposed to alternating conditions of favourable and non-favourable RH, either on a short-term basis (12 hours) or a longer term basis (1 week), while maintaining the temperature at a favourable level for <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> The results were compared to those obtained following exposure to constant, favourable RH. It was shown that both the cyclic conditions slowed down the process of <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on wood; the long-term cycling more than the short term. Fluctuating temperature, while keeping the RH constant at a favourable level, also had an effect on <b>mould</b> <b>growth,</b> as it was slowed down. In order to determine the critical moisture level of a material, it is assumed that this property is the same for all samples from that particular material. Wood is a commonly used building material in Sweden. It is an inhomogeneous material and it was shown in a meta-study in this work that several characteristics of wood affect its {{susceptibility to}} mould growth; surface structure, wood species, sawing pattern and if the surface was recently planed or sawn. It is therefore not possible to predict the general susceptibility of wood to mould based only on a few data as it is affected by several parameters and it is therefore probably not possible to determine a general value of the critical mositure value for wood. Also, the susceptibility cannot be described by one single parameter, as it depends also on other parameters...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMold {{growth on}} the surface of wooden façades is usually dealt with by using surface {{treatment}} such as paint with fungicides. However, new developments in architecture are moving towards less use of coating, and more use of untreated wooden claddings. <b>Mould</b> <b>growth</b> is well understood and described, and several models for predicting <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on building materials exist. It is commonly known that <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> is directly controlled by the climate which the wood is exposed to. Several authors identify humidity, temperature and time as the main drivers of <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> However, most of the current growth models developed are based on laboratory measurements at stable climatic conditions. Consequently, these models are less suitable for prediction of <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on exterior surfaces exposed to rapidly changing weather conditions. This paper analyses the effect of variations of meteorological data on the <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on wooden claddings. An experimental setup of wood samples was exposed to outdoor conditions and hourly weather conditions as well as the <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> at different intervals were measured. The measurements were supplied with 1 -D Heat And Moisture (HAM) simulations to provide a more accurate estimate of the conditions {{on the surface}} of the samples. The purpose of the analysis was to evaluate if an existing <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> model might be applicable also for predicting outdoor <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> Several profiles of temperature and moisture were continuously monitored on different locations of an eight-story building made from Cross Laminated Timber (CLT). The results from the analysis of the samples of wood cladding were used to model the <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on different locations of the building. Also the drying effect of wind around the building was studied. The study shows that there is large variation of potential <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on the façade of the building...|$|R
40|$|A {{successful}} use of untreated wood as facade material requires {{knowledge about}} how the appearance develops over time. Surface moulds greatly affect the appearance of untreated wood, and even more knowledge about the critical levels and interactions of the factors affecting <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> is required to predict the <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> more accurately on materials exposed outdoors. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the development of surface <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> and moisture content on untreated wood exposed to different temperature, relative humidity and wetting periods. Wood properties that were investigated are heartwood/sapwood and density. Specimens of aspen (Populus tremula (L.)), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.)) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) were exposed to eight climatic conditions with two different levels of relative humidity (65 and 85 %), temperature (10 and 25 °C) and wetting period (2 and 4 hours). The specimens in the climates set at 85 % RH were exposed for 91 days, and the specimens in the climates set at 65 % RH were exposed for 119 days. To investigate the development of wood moisture content and <b>mould</b> <b>growth,</b> the specimens were weighed and the degree of <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on each specimen was visually evaluated once a week during the exposure period. Analysis showed that exposure time, wood moisture content, relative humidity, wetting period, wood species and heartwood/sapwood were factors that significantly affected the <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> Increased wood moisture content increased the <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> rate. The effect of temperature was only significant for the development of surface <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on spruce. Lowering the temperature decreases the wood drying rate and this may have counteracted the effect of a higher temperature on the moulds metabolism. Aspen and pine sapwood were most susceptible to <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> Pine heartwood and spruce heartwood were least susceptible to <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> Heartwood was significantly less susceptible to <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> for both pine and spruce. Aspen was the only species where density affected the <b>mould</b> <b>growth,</b> but the heartwood proportion of the specimens of aspen was not known.

Some {{of the most important}} factors for maintaining the indoor environment are temperature and humidity. Unsuitable combinations of heat and moisture (HAM) could indicate a danger of mould growing. The mould’s existence influences the reliability and lifespan of a structure. Some materials, for example wood, are very sensitive to <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> To analyse a structure for <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> risk it is necessary to know the values of temperature and relative humidity on the surfaces and inside of structures. There are two possibilities to acquire these quantities; taking measurements at a construction site or in a laboratory, or applying numerical solutions using an accessible programme. One such programme is Wufi, which has been developed especially for HAM analysis. An advantage of measuring at the construction site is the reality, which is not affected by numerical errors. On the other hand, numerical analysis usually needs lower costs and does not demand so much time to simulate long term periods. From {{the point of view of}} accuracy, it is suitable to verify the numerical solution with measurements. The aim of this paper is threefold. First, to analyse the risk of <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> Second, it presents a verification of numerically calculated data using Wufi 2 D against actual measurement data acquired from a real structure, which is presented by a low-energy house located in Oulu/Finland.

40|$|Many studies {{around the}} world have {{reported}} that moisture-related problems in buildings (i. e., dampness) increase the risk of health effects such as respiratory symptoms, asthma and allergy in both adults and children. However, there is only limited knowledge about which agents in indoor air or dust cause the reported health effects. Biological pollutants such as moulds is one of the explanations that has been suggested. The principal objective of this PhD study has been to increase the knowledge about <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> in buildings and possible links between <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> and health effects in humans. In this PhD study, moisture-acceptance criteria concerning <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> have been developed for several building materials. In general it would seem that spruce and chipboard have a greater resistance to <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> compared to plywood and gypsum. Wind-breaking materials based on wood-fibre and gypsum had an even greater resistance to <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> compared to the other materials. As the RH increased, germination of the spores was faster, and the development and strength of the <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> increased for all materials tested. The experiments also showed that an increase of 1 % RH had a greater influence on the <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> than an increase in temperature of 8 ºC when the RH was above 85 %. Exposure of building materials to high temperatures (up to 60 ºC) decreases, or inhibits, <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> But when the temperature exposure is discontinued, growth continues as if nothing had happened. In this study we have carried out a close examination of low-slope compact roofs as a possible “risk construction” with regard to <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> The drying-out potential and the risk of <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> were examined in roofs exposed to large amounts of water. The results showed that the drying-out potential for the water-damaged roofs were higher than expected, and increased with substantially more ventilation. The observed <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> was relatively small compared to what was expected. In conclusion, flat or low-slope compact roofs would seem to represent a more robust construction regarding the risk of <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> than first expected. In this study, data from two field investigations in Norwegian and Swedish houses concerning different building characteristics, indicators of a moisture damage and indoor relative humidity in accordance to the risk of <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> have been analysed. The results given in this study show that moisture supply is not a constant value throughout the year, but is dependent on the outdoor temperature. According to our measurements, {{it would seem that the}} design curves given in EN ISO 13788 need to be modified if they are to be used in hygro-thermal analysis, both with regard to shape and deflection points, and with regard to the level of varied occupancy and room types. It was also found that the variation of RH and moisture supply generally followed the expected daily variation of moisture production due to the use of the house and the rooms. It was also found that the moisture supply, when calculated on an hourly basis, is highly sensitive to changes in the outdoor air water-vapour content during the day and week. As a general conclusion, therefore, measurements of indoor air humidity should be made on a long-term basis, i. e. minimum one week of measurements. No link was found between water supply and rooms with registered <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> Neither were there any links between indicators of dampness and <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> indoors (as indoor culturable mould spores). This shows that reliance on measurements of mould spores in the indoor air, whether there is a moisture problem in the building or not, is too unpredictable. Reported or observed data concerning water staining and measurements of indoor air humidity are also necessary to verify an indoor moisture problem. In this study there was a link between a higher percentage share of houses with one or more moisture indicators and types of ventilation, types of foundation and building period. There were more cases of registered <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> in houses with no ventilation / natural ventilation compared to houses with mechanical ventilation, and in houses with basement cellars compared to those with slab on ground. There was also a link between greater registered <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> in older houses compared to newer ones. In a risk-reducing strategy it might be useful to improve the ventilation and carry out improvements to the foundations in order to avoid potential moisture damage. Knowledge about which agent is causing the reported health problems in buildings with moisture-related problems is limited. In this study there was no link between mould-spore concentrations (CFU) in the children’s bedrooms and asthma/allergy among the children. Based on these results, there is no reason to carry out one-time air sampling of mould CFU in indoor air of homes in order to identify risk factors for asthma/allergy in children living in Scandinavian countries. These results might also indicate that there could be agents other than mould spores that are the cause of the health effects in damp buildings.

40|$|Mould {{problems}} in buildings {{have become a}} growing concern during the past decades. The <b>growth</b> of <b>mould</b> fungi indoors deteriorates air quality, influences human health and causes economical losses. Preventing <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> from occurring is a more cost effective option than cleaning and renovation of buildings with <b>mould</b> problems. <b>Mould</b> <b>growth</b> will occur in buildings when there are moisture problems. Many constructions have various defects that cause high humidity or even condensation on cold surfaces. Some of these defects are avoidable and can be corrected at the design stage. A calculation tool and knowledge of <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> behaviour {{as a function of}} environmental parameters are therefore needed to predict the risk of <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> for building design. The aim of this project was to study mould behaviour on building materials as a function of environmental parameters, such as temperature and relative humidity and therefore to serve as a tool for preventing mould {{problems in}} buildings. Isothermal calorimetry is the main method used in this project to quantify mould activity. This method has not been applied much in fungal studies. Therefore it was tested and investigated to increase the understanding of the information that could be obtained from such measurements. Calorespirometry experiments (simultaneous calorimetry and respirometry) have been done on several mould fungi as well as on one rot fungus for understanding the correlation between fungal respiration and their heat production. Calorimetry was also compared with some traditional methods used in studying fungal growth by comparing heat produced by mould fungi with its biomass and ergosterol content. This also gave an increased understanding of fungal growth mechanisms. The results proved that calorimetry can not only be used on its own but can also be combined with other techniques to study fungal physiology. The impact of temperature on <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> was studied by comparing the produced heat, biomass and ergosterol of mould at five different temperature levels. <b>Mould</b> <b>growth</b> is highly influenced by temperature and this study also showed that the temperature at which that mould has the most rapid growth is not necessary the temperature at which it has its most efficient growth. This finding reveals the complexity of the influence of temperature on the fungal metabolism. The influence of relative humidity on mould was also studied by measuring the fungal activities of mould growing on wood at different relative humidities. The results showed that although mould activities decreased when the relative humidity was low, too high relative humidity could also seem to inhibit part of its activity. Not only relative humidity but also moisture content is an important factor influencing mould activity. However the interpretation of these measurements was complicated by transient effects. <b>Mould</b> <b>growth</b> development on wood, which were dried and treated at different temperatures was also studied by image analysis.

30|$|Indoor <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common factors that cause adverse health effects and fabric {{deterioration}} in buildings [1 – 3]. Historic buildings may be more prone to material decay and other physical/mechanical processes caused by <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> because of accumulated material damage, exacerbated in certain cases by poor maintenance, drainage issues, poor hygrothermal performance, water leaks and water infiltration into the building envelop due to driven rain or other weather events [4].|$|R
40|$|A {{successful}} use of untreated wood as facade material requires {{knowledge about}} how the appearance develops over time. Surface moulds greatly affect the appearance of untreated wood, and even more knowledge about the critical levels and interactions of the factors affecting <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> is required to predict the <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> more accurately on materials exposed outdoors. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the development of surface <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> and moisture content on untreated wood exposed to different temperature, relative humidity and wetting periods. Wood properties that were investigated are heartwood/sapwood and density. Specimens of aspen (Populus tremula (L.)), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.)) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) were exposed to eight climatic conditions with two different levels of relative humidity (65 and 85 %), temperature (10 and 25 °C) and wetting period (2 and 4 hours). The specimens in the climates set at 85 % RH were exposed for 91 days, and the specimens in the climates set at 65 % RH were exposed for 119 days. To investigate the development of wood moisture content and <b>mould</b> <b>growth,</b> the specimens were weighed and the degree of <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on each specimen was visually evaluated once a week during the exposure period. Analysis showed that exposure time, wood moisture content, relative humidity, wetting period, wood species and heartwood/sapwood were factors that significantly affected the <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> Increased wood moisture content increased the <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> rate. The effect of temperature was only significant for the development of surface <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on spruce. Lowering the temperature decreases the wood drying rate and this may have counteracted the effect of a higher temperature on the moulds metabolism. Aspen and pine sapwood were most susceptible to <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> Pine heartwood and spruce heartwood were least susceptible to <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> Heartwood was significantly less susceptible to <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> for both pine and spruce. Aspen was the only species where density affected the <b>mould</b> <b>growth,</b> but the heartwood proportion of the specimens of aspen was not known. Uncertainties regarding the actual climatic conditions made it challenging to draw conclusions about critical levels of the factors. Vellykket bruk av ubehandlet tre som fasademateriale krever kunnskap om hvordan fasadens utseende endrer seg over tid. Svertesopp kan ha stor betydning for dette, og vi trenger mer kunnskap om kritiske nivåer og interaksjoner mellom faktorene som påvirker soppveksten for å mer presist kunne forutse svertesoppvekst på materialer eksponert utendørs. Målet med denne studien var å undersøke utviklingen av svertesopp og fuktighetsinnhold på ubehandlet tre ved ulik temperatur, relativ luftfuktighet og våttid. Virkesegenskaper som er undersøkt er kjerneved/yteved og densitet. Prøver av osp (Populus tremula(L.)), furu (Pinus sylvestris(L.)) og gran (Picea abies(L.) Karst) ble eksponert for åtte klimaer med to ulike nivåer av relativ luftfuktighet (65 og 85 %), temperatur (10 og 25 °C) og våttid (2 og 4 timer). Forsøket varte i 91 dager for prøvene i klimaene innstilt på 85 % relativ luftfuktighet, og i 119 dager for prøvene i klimaene innstilt på 65 % relativ luftfuktighet. Prøvene ble veiet og visuelt evaluert for grad av svertesoppvekst en gang per uke, for å undersøke utviklingen av fuktighetsinnhold og soppvekst over tid. Analysene viste at eksponeringstid, trevirkets fuktighetsinnhold, relativ luftfuktighet, våttid, treslag og kjerneved/yteved hadde en signifikant påvirkning på svertesoppveksten. Økt fuktighetsinnhold økte veksten. Temperaturen hadde kun signifikant effect for svertesoppveksten på gran. Lavere temperatur fører til at trevirket tørker saktere og dette kan ha jevnet ut effekten av høyere temperatur på soppens metabolisme. Osp og furu yteved hadde mest svertesoppvekst, og furu kjerneved og gran kjerneved hadde minst svertesoppvekst. Kjerneved hadde signifikant mindre svertesoppvekst enn yteved for både furu og gran. Osp var eneste treslag hvor densiteten hadde en signifikant effekt for svertesoppveksten, men kjernevedandelen for osp var ikke kjent. Usikkerheter rundt faktiske forhold i klimaene gjorde det utfordrende å trekke konklusjoner rundt kritiske nivåer for de ulike faktorene. M-B...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mould</b> <b>growth</b> in {{buildings}} affects indoor air quality. To prevent <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> in building components, {{there is a}} need for design tools that take into account both microclimate and <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> patterns. We propose a novel laboratory method to assess <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> as a function of RH, temperature and substrate by measuring the thermal power produced by the fungal metabolism as a measure of growth rate with an isothermal calorimeter. Isothermal calorimetry gives a continuous recording of the thermal power released by a sample. It is a non-destructive technique so that many measurements can be made on a single fungal sample under different conditions. By combining the calorimeter with a humidity generator in which the RH (water activity) of a sample can be changed, it is possible to measure the activity of a mould sample at many different RH-temperature conditions in a relatively short time. Measurements can be made with the samples growing on realistic substrates like wood or gypsum board paper. In the present paper we describe how data on mould activity generated by isothermal microcalorimetry can be used together with data on the mould microclimate to model the growth of the fungi. 1...|$|R
40|$|Problems {{with high}} {{humidity}} levels and <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> in cold attics have been increasing {{over the last}} few years. A recent Swedish study showed that as many as up to 60 – 80 % of the single-family houses in Västra Götaland (largely, the Gothenburg region) are showing significant <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> and thereby risk developing serious moisture problems. The high humidity levels are to a large extent a consequence of the increasing demand on energy efficiency. Houses are frequently retrofitted with additional attic insulation, which leads to a colder attic space and hence a higher humidity. Furthermore, furnace heating is often replaced in favour of heat pumps or district heat. This may alter the air-pressure balance of the house, resulting in an increased thermal pressure on the ceiling with subsequent air-leakage up to the attic. Also newly built attics have problems. A risk assessment of the risk for <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> is performed for different design of the attic. Also a simplified life cycle cost is estimated for the different design alternatives. The alternative with controlled ventilation is estimated to be risk free with lowest life cycle cost. Roof insulation gives low risk for <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> in northern part of Sweden...|$|R
40|$|Studying {{the effects}} of the climate change on {{buildings}} contains two major fields: energy consumption and durability. In the field of durability the moisture effects on the building play a significant role. In Sweden the last 10 - 15 years have been mild and wet compared to previously. Precipitation increased considerably during the period (+ 11 %), whereas temperature increase were weaker (+ 0. 7 oC). The direction in which the most recent decade deviated from earlier observations is to a large degree consistent with what is suggested by climate scenarios. A consequence of increasing humidity and temperature in outdoor environment is higher risk of the <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> in buildings. The conditions for the <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on wooden surfaces can be described by <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> index (MGI), which basically tells how large part of a surface is covered by mould. MGI can be numerically evaluated from the known hygrothermal conditions at a surface, e. g. from the temperature and relative humidity and their time distribution.

There is a need to address this potential problem since the amount of passive houses and low energy buildings are increasing as a means to reduce energy use, energy dependency and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper evaluates energy performance and moisture performance simultaneously {{in order to create a}} more holistic approach. Space heating demand, peak load for space heating and risk for <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> are evaluated.

40|$|Building {{materials}} {{differ in}} their susceptibility to <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> Wood is a material often considered to have a low mould resistance. However, wood is not a homogenous material and different characteristics of the material {{are expected to have}} an impact on <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> In this paper, it was shown that wood species (pine or spruce), sawing pattern (centre-board or side-board) and surface structure (planed or sawn) affected <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> In addition, it was indicated that the susceptibility cannot be described by one single parameter, but also depends on other parameters. It is therefore difficult to estimate the susceptibility of wood in general.

40|$|Most of {{the last}} 20 years in Sweden have been mild and wet {{compared}} to the 1961 - 1990 climate reference period. After a few relatively cold years in the mid- 1980 s, practically all years have been warmer than the preceding 30 years average. During the indicated period, an increase of moisture-related problems (<b>mould</b> <b>growth)</b> was observed in ventilated attics, a moisture sensitive building part. This work investigates hygrothermal performance of ventilated attics in respect to possible climate change. Hygrothermal simulations of attics were performed numerically in Matlab. Four attic constructions are investigated - a conventional attic and three alternative constructions suggested by practitioners. Simulations were done {{for the period of}} 1961 - 2100 using the weather data of RCA 3 climate model. Effects of three different emissions scenarios are considered. Hygrothermal conditions in the attic are assessed using a <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> model. Based on the results the highest risk of <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> was found on the north roof of the attic in Gothenburg, Sweden. Results point to increment of the moisture problems in attics in future. Different emissions scenarios do not influence the risk of <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> inside the attic due to compensating changes in different variables. Assessing the future performance of the four attics shows that the safe solution is to ventilate the attic mechanically, though this solution inevitably requires extra use of electrical energy for running the fan. Insulating roofs of the attic can decrease the condensation on roofs, but it cannot decrease the risk of <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> considerably, on the wooden roof underlay...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{some results}} from a theoretical study of moisture and temperature conditions in cold lofts {{and the risk of}} <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on the roof underlay in various climates in Norway. The computational model developed for this study calculates the heat, air, and moisture balances within the loft considering parameters describing the building, building materials, outdoor climate as well as parameters influenced by the occupiers. Both stack effect and air leakage distribution are included in the model as air leakages play a key roll both for the moisture content of the indoor air and for the moisture transport {{in and out of the}} loft. In order to perform quantified parameter studies a <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> potential is introduced. By using simplified relations between the relative rate of <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> and temperature and relative humidity, respectively, a total <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> potential is summarized for successive calculation periods. Traditionally cold lofts in Norway have been vented, by openings at the eaves, gables and the ridge, in order to prevent snow melting and to give the roof drying out capability. Closed lofts, without openings to the exterior, however, have several advantages like improved protection against spread of fire reduced risk of snow drifting into the loft and reduced heat loss due to reduced air flow through the roof insulation. The study shows that closed cold lofts may be constructed with low risk of <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> The roof however, has to be correctly designed using roof underlay with sufficiently low vapour resistance and...|$|R
30|$|Another {{important}} factor that makes Blickling Hall, and historic museum/art gallery indoor environments in general, {{more susceptible to}} <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> {{is the presence of}} abundant organic materials, such as paper, parchment, textile and leather, which provide nutrients for <b>mould</b> <b>growth.</b> In conjunction with low ventilation, this explains why surface <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> has historically been concentrated at the back of vellum-covered books, silken wall covers, and tapestry, where, under suitable conditions, fungi readily grow, resulting in damage ranging from stains to complete decay [22, 23]. The two strategies, suggested particularly for the historic museum/art gallery indoor environments, are therefore to keep the RH under 65 %, and keep surfaces clean and free of dust at all times [23]. To maintain a suitable environment, the National Trust stabilises indoor hygrothermal conditions at moderate relative humidity and temperature levels using humidistatically controlled conservation heating. In this approach space heating operates when the RH is above a set point of 58 – 60 % and is switched off when the RH falls below the set point, so that a moderate RH can be maintained that is below the threshold for <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> but not so low as to risk drying and shrinkage of hygroscopic materials [24].|$|R

The impact of cold bridging, seasonal variations, variable moisture production and hygroscopic materials are reviewed (but not interstitial condensation) and a comparison between modelled and measured data for 36 dwellings carried out. Results indicate that a steady-state model utilising Bredem- 8 to predict internal temperatures and Loudon's condensation model to predict moisture shows good (± 10 %) agreement with monitored data.
