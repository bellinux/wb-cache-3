5|$|The adult {{stage of}} a caddisfly may only survive for a few weeks; many species do not feed as adults and die soon after breeding, but some species are known to feed on nectar. The winged insects are nocturnal and provide food for night-flying birds, bats, small mammals, {{amphibians}} and arthropods. The larval stage lasts much longer, often for one or more years, and has a bigger impact on the environment. They form {{an important part of}} the diet of fish such as the trout. The fish acquire them by two <b>means,</b> <b>either</b> plucking them off vegetation or the stream-bed as the larvae move about, or during the daily behavioural drift; this drift happens during the night for many species of aquatic larvae, or around midday for some cased caddisfly species, and may result from population pressures or be a dispersal device. The larvae may drift in great numbers either close to the bottom, in mid-water or just below the surface. The fish swallow them whole, case and all.|$|E
25|$|Mundubbera <b>means</b> <b>either</b> Footsteps in {{the trees}} or Meeting Place of the waters in the local Aboriginal language. The latter name refers to the {{confluence}} of the Burnett, Auburn and Boyne rivers just upstream from Mundubbera.|$|E

25|$|The dealer {{is chosen}} by various <b>means,</b> <b>either</b> by {{throwing}} dice (the highest total takes the east wind), by placing {{one of each}} wind face down and having each player randomly select one of these tiles or other house rule variations. Each player sits down at their respective position (called the wind position) {{at the table in}} positions of an inverted compass: East is dealer, the right of the dealer is South, across is West and the left is North. The order essentially is counter-clockwise.|$|E
25|$|Rice, {{like other}} cereal grains, can be puffed (or popped). This process takes {{advantage}} of the grains' water content and typically involves heating grains in a special chamber. Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing puffed pellets in a low-pressure chamber. The ideal gas law <b>means</b> <b>either</b> lowering the local pressure or raising the water temperature results in an increase in volume prior to water evaporation, resulting in a puffy texture. Bulk raw rice density is about 0.9 g/cm³. It decreases to less than one-tenth that when puffed.|$|E
25|$|From the {{application}} protocol point of view, TLS {{belongs to a}} lower layer, although the TCP/IP model is too coarse to show it. This means that the TLS handshake is usually (except in the STARTTLS case) performed before {{the application}} protocol can start. In the name-based virtual server feature being provided by the application layer, all co-hosted virtual servers share the same certificate because the server has to select and send a certificate immediately after the ClientHello message. This {{is a big problem}} in hosting environments because it <b>means</b> <b>either</b> sharing the same certificate among all customers or using a different IP address for each of them.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{a large number of}} verbal aspects: {{perfective}} (completed) vs. imperfective (uncompleted), telic (reaching a goal) vs. atelic, continuing, repeated, and commencing. However, despite this complexity, there appears to be little distinction of transitivity. For example, the same verb, xobai, can <b>mean</b> <b>either</b> 'look' or 'see', and xoab can <b>mean</b> <b>either</b> 'die' or 'kill'.|$|R
5000|$|Another difficulty, {{especially}} regarding declensions, is {{that often}} the same ending serves two different functions: rēgēs [...] "kings" [...] could be either nominative or accusative, rēgibus could <b>mean</b> <b>either</b> [...] "for the kings" [...] or [...] "with the kings", puellae could <b>mean</b> <b>either</b> [...] "girls" [...] or [...] "of the girl" [...] or [...] "for the girl".|$|R

25|$|Rotary swaging {{is usually}} a cold working process, used to reduce the diameter, produce a taper, or add a point to a round workpiece. It can also impart {{internal}} shapes in hollow workpieces {{through the use of}} a mandrel (the shape must have a constant cross-section). Swaging a bearing into a housing <b>means</b> <b>either</b> flaring its groove's lips onto the chamfer of the housing, or flaring the housing's material over the edge of the bearing. The flaring is done with a pair of rolls that travel around the hole and are fed down into the part, deforming the metal in a controlled, predicted way. Grease is often used to lubricate this swaging process, which is also called roller swaging.|$|E
500|$|A {{man named}} Æthelstan {{who died at}} the Battle of Ringmere in 1010, [...] "the king's aþum", was {{probably}} Thored's son. The term aþum <b>means</b> <b>either</b> [...] "son-in-law" [...] or [...] "brother-in-law", so this Æthelstan could also have been Thored's grandson by an unknown intermediary. Thored's immediate successor was Ælfhelm, who appears witnessing charters as ealdorman from 994.|$|E
500|$|The {{mens rea}} element {{is that of}} [...] "malice", which <b>means</b> <b>either</b> {{intention}} or recklessness. Cunningham recklessness is applied. However, {{for the purposes of}} recklessness, foresight of even minor harm is sufficient [...] it does not require foresight of serious harm. This has been criticised since it breaks the correspondence principle, that the mens rea should match the actus reus of an offence.|$|E

500|$|Welsh Corgis have {{historically}} been used as herding dogs, specifically for cattle. They are {{of the type of}} herding dog referred to as [...] "heelers", meaning that they would nip at the heels of the larger animals to keep them on the move. Both Pembrokeshire and Cardigan are historically agricultural areas of Wales. The combination of the low height off the ground and innate agility of Welsh Corgis would allow them to avoid the hooves of cattle. The term [...] "corgi" [...] <b>means</b> <b>either</b> cur dog or dwarf dog (cor = dwarf, gi = lenitive of ci, dog) in the Welsh language, which was not intended as an insult to the dog's size, rather as a purely descriptive term. There is also a folk legend that says corgis were a gift from the woodland fairies, and that the breed's markings were left on its coat by fairy harnesses and saddles.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Budapest rook" [...] was an invigorating {{innovation}} of the 1980s, {{and gave}} the gambit new life. However, inconveniences arise from delaying d7–d6 {{in order to allow}} the lift: the light-square bishop has to wait a long time to develop, and any attack on the Bc5 is potentially annoying for Black (since it <b>means</b> <b>either</b> closing the sixth rank with ...d6/...b6, abandoning the active a7–g1 diagonal, or blocking the rook when deployed to a7). This, in addition to the risk of awkwardness in the king side (a knight on f5 will fork the Rh6 and the Qh4) and the single-mindedness of Black's plan (with nothing to fall back on if the direct attack is repelled), has made some revisit the old lines, where it is instead the king's rook that is developed to h6. The queen's rook can then be retained on the queenside, and will be well-placed if the b-file opens as a result of Black's Bc5 being exchanged and recaptured with a b6 pawn.|$|E
500|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the word}} dodo is unclear. Some ascribe it to the Dutch word dodoor for [...] "sluggard", {{but it is more}} probably related to Dodaars, which <b>means</b> <b>either</b> [...] "fat-arse" [...] or [...] "knot-arse", referring to the knot of feathers on the hind end. The first record {{of the word}} Dodaars is in Captain Willem Van West-Zanen's journal in 1602. The English writer Sir Thomas Herbert was the first to use the word dodo in print in his 1634 travelogue, claiming it was referred to as such by the Portuguese, who had visited Mauritius in 1507. Another Englishman, Emmanuel Altham, had used the word in a 1628 letter, in which he also claimed the origin was Portuguese. The name [...] "dodar" [...] was introduced into English {{at the same time as}} dodo, but was only used until the 18th century. As far as is known, the Portuguese never mentioned the bird. Nevertheless, some sources still state that the word dodo derives from the Portuguese word doudo (currently doido), meaning [...] "fool" [...] or [...] "crazy". It has also been suggested that dodo was an onomatopoeic approximation of the bird's call, a two-note pigeon-like sound resembling [...] "doo-doo".|$|E

500|$|Juniata County was {{historically}} {{a part of}} Cumberland County {{and later}} Mifflin County. Juniata County was formed on March 2, 1831, from parts of Mifflin County. It is named after the Juniata River. The word [...] "juniata" [...] itself is a Seneca word that <b>means</b> <b>either</b> [...] "people of the standing stone" [...] or [...] "blue waters". The first boroughs in the county to be settled were Mifflintown and Thompsontown, which were settled in 1790. Port Royal and Mifflin were settled in 1812 and 1848, respectively. The first of these borough to be incorporated was Mifflintown, on March 6, 1833. The last one to be incorporated was Thompsontown, on February 7, 1868. However, squatters arrived in the county and were removed from it considerably earlier, by 1750 {{and one of the}} first warrants for land in the county was issued in 1755. Many of the earliest landowners in Delaware Township were speculators as opposed to settlers. There was an Indian raid in the county in 1755 and 1756, although Fort Bingham and Fort Peterson had been constructed. The Beale family was one of the earliest families to inhabit the county. More settlers arrived in the 1750s and 1760s and the first gristmill on the western side of the Juniata River was built in the county in 1767. A public road was built in the county between Tuscarora Creek and a location near Shade Mountain in 1768. John Hamilton constructed a sawmill and gristmill on Cocalamus Creek in Delaware Township in 1776. The first known physician in the county, Dr. Ezra Doty, settled in Mifflintown in 1791.|$|E

5000|$|In Estonian, [...] "tapa" [...] is {{also the}} {{imperative}} form of the verb [...] "kill". This {{has led to an}} urban legend that during Soviet times the town had a newspaper called [...] "Tapa Kommunist", which could <b>mean</b> <b>either</b> [...] "Communist of Tapa", or [...] "Kill a Communist". Later the name was changed to [...] "Tapa Edasi", which could <b>mean</b> <b>either</b> [...] "Tapa Forward", or [...] "Keep Killing".|$|R
