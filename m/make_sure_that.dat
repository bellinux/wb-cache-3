2500|$|There {{are also}} modern {{thermostats}} featuring adaptive algorithms to further improve the inertia prone system behaviour. For instance, setting those {{up so that}} {{the temperature in the}} morning at 7a.m. should be 21°C (69.8°F), <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> at that time the temperature will be 21°C (69.8°F), where a conventional thermostat would just start working at that time. [...] The algorithms decide at what time the system should be activated in order to reach the desired temperature at the desired time. It also <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the temperature is very stable (for instance, by reducing overshoots).|$|R

5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals {{was the only way to}} achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Dakar on 26 August, the DNOG was tasked with patrolling a triangle with corners at Dakar, Cape Verde and Gibraltar; the Allies {{believed that this}} area was rife with U-boats waiting for convoys to pass through.

Complications arose when both Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul had problems with their condensers, a matter which was made much worse by the hot, tropical climate in which the ships were serving.|$|E
