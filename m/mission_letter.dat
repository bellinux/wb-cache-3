50|$|For {{the first}} few years after the system was introduced, the manufacturer's letter and the <b>mission</b> <b>letter</b> were {{sometimes}} reversed. If it was the manufacturer's first design for that particular mission, there was no number before the manufacturer letter.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>mission</b> <b>letter</b> for Malmström’s {{position}} also includes, {{as one of}} her key duties, the [...] "successful conclusion" [...] of {{the controversial}} trade negotiations with the USA, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), though with a number of restrictions and confinements to the negotiation mandate to address European public concerns over TTIP. Having expressed a view strongly in favour of the treaty, she tried to revive the negotiations with the USA two weeks after entering office.|$|E
5000|$|Although the <b>mission</b> <b>letters</b> of the AV-8 Harrier's {{designation}} are correct, {{the series}} number is not. The Ryan XV-8 ("Fleep") had already existed, so, while A-8 {{would have been}} fine, the V designation should have been AV-14.|$|R

5000|$|The CC-130J Hercules {{referred}} to the stretched C-130J-30 Hercules. The -30 suffix was not supportable in the system, yet another series letter (C-130L, for instance) was apparently not appropriate, so a modified <b>mission</b> <b>letter</b> had to be added. Hence, the CC-130J is, bizarrely, a cargo aircraft [...] "modified" [...] for the cargo role. This was later dropped. The CC-130J {{should not be confused}} with the CC-130 Hercules operated by the Canadian Airforce. The first [...] "C" [...] identifies the aircraft as a Canadian asset. Canada later acquired C-130Js as CC-130Js.|$|E
50|$|Cecilia Malmström {{became the}} new Commissioner for Trade in late 2014. The <b>mission</b> <b>letter</b> {{for her new}} post {{mentioned}} the successful conclusion of the controversial trade negotiations with the USA, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), {{as one of her}} key duties, but with a number of restrictions and confinements to the negotiation mandate to address European public concerns over TTIP. The confinements were the result of the hearing in the European parliament a few weeks before, where she had to face some tough questions over the TTIP negotiations. She tried to revive the negotiations with the USA two weeks after entering office.|$|E

50|$|In 1962, the Department of Defense unified its {{aircraft}} designation systems {{along the}} lines of the Air Force's system. Many Navy aircraft then in service were redesignated. For many planes, the <b>mission</b> <b>letters</b> and design numbers were retained, as the Douglas AD Skyraider became the A-1 and the McDonnell F4H Phantom II became the F-4. Some aircraft design numbers were not retained, like the North American Vigilante, which was redesignated from A3J to A-5 (the A-3 designation having already been assigned to the A-3 Skywarrior).|$|R

By 1891, China was added to the list of countries that The Mission to Lepers was working in.|$|R
40|$|In his <b>mission</b> <b>letter</b> to Arias Cañete, Jean-Claude Juncker {{asked the}} {{designated}} Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy {{to focus on}} further developing EU policy for renewables in order to “be a world leader in this sector” and on promoting the EU Emissions Trading System “to ensure that we reach our climate goals in a cost-effective way”. Furthermore, he would like Alenka Bratušek, the designated Vice-President for Energy Union, to focus on “completing the internal energy market” and on “increasing competition”. In assessing the feasibility and desirability of this remit, this commentary finds these objectives to be very ambitious but more importantly, partially conflicting, {{given the state of}} play in EU energy markets...|$|E
40|$|The Netherlands {{must remain}} a {{beautiful}} and prosperous country and, to maintain it, large-scale investments will be needed in the decades to come. This is {{the gist of the}} <b>mission</b> <b>letter</b> that the Dutch Cabinet sent to Parliament in 1996. In response, the so-called ICES/KIS work group defined six score themes within which knowledge had to be developed, mobilized and applied to help these investments do their work. This led to the foundation of the so-called ICES/KIS institutes, including KLICT (Chains, Networks, Logistics and Information & Communication Technology), whose mission it is to create a (virtual) knowledge center for chain and network studies in which knowledge will be developed, maintained and distributed. This knowledge needs to deliver a fundamental contribution to the transformation of traditional governmental controlled sectors into flexible and competitive chains and networks {{on the one hand and}} to resolve societal bottlenecks on the other hand. In this positioning paper, we sketch the economic and business context of the KLICT subprogram “Reconfiguration of chains an...|$|E

In Norton Township (the area Booth was sent to on his mission), the effect of Booth's letters is such that [...] "the public feeling was, that 'Mormonism' was overthrown" [...] until Reynolds Cahoon, David Whitmer, and Lyman E.
