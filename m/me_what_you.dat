25|$|Allen {{wrote the}} novel Just Tell <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want! in 1969, {{with the idea}} of turning it into a screenplay. After having trouble getting {{together}} a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted to do it. In her opinion, Lumet was a wonderful structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. Some of the humor was lost in Just Tell <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want when Sidney gave the voice-over to Ali MacGraw instead of Myrna Loy as was originally intended. But the collaboration worked wonderfully; unbeknownst to each other they both had wanted to cast Alan King. This synchronicity in casting preference continued with all three Lumet/Allen movies.|$|E

She toured in a 1978 production of Alan Ayckbourn's Relatively Speaking, directed by David Clayton.|$|E

500|$|At the 2007 Black Entertainment Television (BET) Awards, Beyoncé won Video of the Year Award for [...] "Irreplaceable", {{an award}} for which [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] was also {{nominated}}. It was nominated for Video of the Year during the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards, but it lost to Rihanna's single, [...] "Umbrella" [...] (2007).

500|$|The album's {{opening track}} is [...] "Survival". It is a [...] "sweetly funky number" [...] which tries to [...] "convey a loosely drawn {{narrative}} of the punishment she endured from the media and her feelings {{leading up to the}} release". It has a lyrical allusion to the singer's 1986 single [...] "Live to Tell", with double-tracked strong vocals and harmonies. In the song, Madonna enhanced the rhythmic sounds more and compressed the bass sounds, in order to cater to the then musical trend. Containing multiple hooks, [...] "Survival"'s lyrics are about dualities like heaven/hell, up/down, angels/saints. [...] "Secret", the second song, begins with just the sound of Madonna's voice singing over a rhythmic, folksy guitar in descending chord sequence, before opening up to a sparse, retro rhythm section. A deep percussion starts around the one minute mark, accompanied by wah-wah ascending string line, supporting the descending guitar. Towards the end, an upper harmonic melody is added to display variance. Madonna's voice remains {{at the center of the}} song's production, as she sings lyrics such as [...] "happiness lies in your own hand". Throughout the song, Madonna also sings the lyrics [...] "My baby's got a secret", however she never discloses what the secret may be. During the next song, [...] "I'd Rather Be Your Lover", Madonna lusts after the unattainable through processes of negotiation: [...] "I could be your sister, I could be your mother, We could be friends, I'd even be your brother". Towards the middle of the song, an eight bar rap break is taken by singer and rapper Meshell Ndegeocello, who raps: [...] "Tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want / Tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> need...". Madonna interrupts, with her voice foregrounded and juxtaposed over the short interjections of Ndegeocello's rap part. A trip hop track, the song is musically comparable to the tracks on Portishead's 1994 album, Dummy, and also contains influences of new jack swing. It uses a sample from [...] "It's Your Thing" [...] performed by Lou Donaldson.|$|E

500|$|Perry Como {{made the}} move to {{television}} when NBC initially televised the Chesterfield Supper Club radio program on December 24, 1948. A very special guest on that first television show was Como's eight-year-old son, Ronnie, {{as part of a}} boys' choir singing [...] "Silent Night" [...] with his father. The show was the usual Friday night Chesterfield Supper Club with an important exception—it was also being broadcast on television. The experimental simulcast was to continue for three Friday [...] "Supper Club" [...] shows, but had gone so well, NBC decided to extend the televised version through August 1949. Years later, Como admitted to being scared and feeling awkward initially, but somehow managed to just be himself. Said Como, [...] "You can't act on TV. With <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> see is what you get." [...] While still in its experimental phase, Como and the television show survived an on location broadcast in Durham, North Carolina, on April 15, 1949.|$|E
500|$|... "Suga Mama" [...] {{features}} the female protagonist offering up {{the keys to}} her house and car, and her credit card just to keep her love interest and his good loving at home, presumably {{so that he can}} listen to her collection of old soul records. These interpretations are shown in the lines: [...] "It's so good to the point that I'll do anything just to keep you home ... Tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want me to buy, my accountant's waiting on the phone ...". The woman also sees the man as a sex object, asking him to sit on her lap and [...] "take it off while I watch you perform". Staff members of USA Today contrasted [...] "Suga Mama" [...] with the 1999 song [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] by Destiny's Child (of which Knowles was a member), writing that [...] "From needing somebody to pay her automo-bills, [...] now doling out the cash as a satisfaction-seeking 'Suga Mama'." [...] Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that Knowles sings: [...] "I could be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store" [...] with the same sense of mischief as Christina Aguilera on 'Candyman' (2007)." [...] On the other hand, Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine noticed that the song's lyrical arrangement was similar to that of Tina Turner's work. A remix of the song features American rapper Consequence.|$|E
500|$|... "Bassline" [...] {{was written}} by Andrea Simms, Andrew [...] "Pop" [...] Wansel, Chris Brown, David Johnson, Robert Calloway, Ronald [...] "Flippa" [...] Colson and Warren [...] "Oak" [...] Felder.

The recordings were later mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance by Trehy Harris. Musically, [...] "Bassline" [...] is a dubstep, electropop and electrohop song, that incorporates elements of reggae. The song lasts for three minutes and 58 seconds. Instrumentation consists of a wobble bass and synthesizers. Album Review|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|date=2012-07-16|accessdate=2012-09-10}} Melinda Newman of HitFix compared [...] "Bassline" [...] to the songs by Kesha and LMFAO. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush noted that the lyrics are about Brown trying to [...] "convince a hot girl he spots in the club {{to come back to}} his crib", in which he sings [...] "Hey girl tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> talk / Pretty as a picture on the wall / Hey girl you can get it all / Cause I know you like the way the beat go". Brown also declares, [...] "You heard about my image / But I could give a flying motherfuck who's offended". Hayley Avron of Contactmusic.com noted that a robot voice joins Brown in the hook [...] "Girls like my bassline". Hazel Robinson of California Literary Review magazine noted that the word [...] "bassline" [...] is a metaphor for penis.|$|E

500|$|In 1974, Lafayette Afro Rock Band {{replaced}} guitarist Larry Jones with Michael McEwan, {{and released}} Soul Makossa (released in the U.S. as Movin' and Groovin). The title track was a cover version of Manu Dibango's international hit, [...] "Soul Makossa." [...] LP Though {{it failed to}} chart, it made sufficient impact that its standout song, the oft-covered [...] "Hihache", was sampled regularly for over 20 years by artists as diverse as Janet Jackson, Biz Markie, LL Cool J, De La Soul, Digital Underground, Naughty by Nature, and the Wu-Tang Clan. Lafayette Afro Rock Band's follow-up effort, the 1975 LP Malik, prominently featured the Univox Super-Fuzz and liberal usage of the talk box. It met equal enduring success, with a modified horn and saxophone sample of [...] "Darkest Light" [...] being featured prominently in Public Enemy's [...] "Show 'Em Whatcha Got". The original sax solo on [...] "Darkest Light" [...] from the Malik LP was played by Leroy Gomez who later became popular as the lead singer of Santa Esmeralda group with the 1977 mega-hit single [...] "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood". After Public Enemy's usage of the song was highly praised, samples of [...] "Darkest Light" [...] backed numerous culturally significant songs, including [...] "Back to the Hotel", the multi-platinum 1992 single [...] "Rump Shaker" [...] by new jack group Wreckx-n-Effect and rapper Jay-Z's 2006 single [...] "Show <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Got".|$|E
500|$|The deluxe {{version of}} Rebel Heart {{begins with the}} track [...] "Best Night", an 80s electro {{composition}} reminiscent of Sade's songs with drums and Indian flute instrumentation. Madonna begins the song with the line, [...] "You can call me M tonight" [...] but her voice is not discernible in the chorus, only in the harmonies. There is another reference to [...] "Justify My Love" [...] {{at one point during}} the intermediate bridge."Veni Vidi Vici" [...] appears next, and is a rap [...] "origin story song" [...] with its lyrics built around Madonna's songs: [...] "I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle / Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile / And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the Borderline / and when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their minds". Madonna sings the chorus over simple guitar beats, uttering [...] "I came, I saw, I conquered", the English translation of the song's title. Nas appears for a guest verse talking about his own life as Diplo backs it with shotgun and crunching horn sounds. [...] "S.E.X." [...] is the next track where Madonna asks sarcastically [...] "tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> know about sex" [...] over sounds of bass, synths and a string arpeggio. Near the end she lists a number of bondage items like: [...] "Twisted rope, handcuffs, blindfold, string of pearls". Described as both an embodiment and critique of act, [...] "S.E.X." [...] talks about the lack of intimacy with Madonna rapping in a [...] "dispassionate" [...] voice; she purposely made it sound like she had a lisp in her articulation of the words.|$|E
