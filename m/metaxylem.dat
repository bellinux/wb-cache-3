50|$|Xylem {{development}} {{can be described}} by four terms: centrarch, exarch, endarch and mesarch. As it develops in young plants, its nature changes from protoxylem to <b>metaxylem</b> (i.e. from first xylem to after xylem).

50|$|There {{are four}} main {{patterns}} to {{the arrangement of}} protoxylem and <b>metaxylem</b> in stems and roots.|$|E
5000|$|Mesarch is {{used when}} {{there is more than}} one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem {{develops}} from the middle of a strand in both directions. The <b>metaxylem</b> is thus on both the peripheral and central sides of the strand with the protoxylem between the <b>metaxylem</b> (possibly surrounded by it).

50|$|As a young {{vascular}} plant grows, {{one or more}} strands of primary xylem form in its stems and roots. The first xylem to develop is called 'protoxylem'. In appearance protoxylem is usually distinguished by narrower vessels formed of smaller cells. Some of these cells have walls which contain thickenings {{in the form of}} rings or helices. Functionally, protoxylem can extend: the cells are able to grow in size and develop while a stem or root is elongating. Later, 'metaxylem' develops in the strands of xylem. <b>Metaxylem</b> vessels and cells are usually larger; the cells have thickenings which are typically either in the form of ladderlike transverse bars (scalariform) or continuous sheets except for holes or pits (pitted). Functionally, <b>metaxylem</b> completes its development after elongation ceases when the cells no longer need to grow in size.|$|E
5000|$|Endarch is {{used when}} {{there is more than}} one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem {{develops}} from the inside outwards towards the periphery, i.e. centrifugally. The protoxylem is thus closest to the center of the stem or root and the <b>metaxylem</b> closest to the periphery. The stems of seed plants typically have endarch development.|$|E
5000|$|Exarch is {{used when}} {{there is more than}} one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem {{develops}} from the outside inwards towards the center, i.e. centripetally. The <b>metaxylem</b> is thus closest to the center of the stem or root and the protoxylem closest to the periphery. The roots of vascular plants are normally considered to have exarch development.|$|E
5000|$|Centrarch {{refers to}} the {{case in which the}} primary xylem forms a single {{cylinder}} {{in the center of the}} stem and develops from the center outwards. The protoxylem is thus found in the central core and the <b>metaxylem</b> in a cylinder around it. This pattern was common in early land plants, such as [...] "rhyniophytes", but is not present in any living plants.|$|E
50|$|The {{stems of}} zosterophylls were either smooth or covered with small spines known as enations, {{branched}} dichotomously, and grew {{at the ends}} by unrolling, {{a process known as}} circinate vernation. The stems had a central vascular column in which the protoxylem was exarch, and the <b>metaxylem</b> developed centripetally. The sporangia were kidney-shaped (reniform), with conspicuous lateral dehiscence and were borne laterally in a fertile zone towards the tips of the branches.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, a {{study was}} carried out on the {{morphological}} and anatomical properties of Iris iberica subsp. elegantissima and Iris sintenisii were investigated. The cross-sections of root, scape and leaf parts of the plant were examined. During the anatomical studies, the wall thickenings of the endodermal cells {{were found to be}} three-sided. Leaf features, such as papillae, <b>metaxylem</b> number in the root and arrangement of vascular bundles can be used as distinguishing characters for the Iris species.|$|E
50|$|In both species, {{the primary}} xylem strand {{was central to}} stems, {{branches}} and appendages. In the main stems and branches it was X-shaped in cross-section, corresponding to the four rows of branches. In the final appendages it became circular in cross-section. The xylem development was 'mesarch', i.e. the first maturing protoxylem had later maturing <b>metaxylem</b> on either side. Protoxylem occurred both at {{the tips of the}} lobes of the xylem strand and in the centre. The general anatomy of the woody stem resembles that of seed plants.|$|E
50|$|Xylem {{appeared}} {{early in}} the history of terrestrial plant life. Fossil plants with anatomically preserved xylem are known from the Silurian (more than 400 million years ago), and trace fossils resembling individual xylem cells may be found in earlier Ordovician rocks. The earliest true and recognizable xylem consists of tracheids with a helical-annular reinforcing layer added to the cell wall. This is the only type of xylem found in the earliest vascular plants, and this type of cell continues {{to be found in the}} protoxylem (first-formed xylem) of all living groups of plants. Several groups of plants later developed pitted tracheid cells, it seems, through convergent evolution. In living plants, pitted tracheids do not appear in development until the maturation of the <b>metaxylem</b> (following the protoxylem).|$|E

Here we confirmed correlations between root cross sectional area and stele area, and between both those traits and total <b>metaxylem</b> vessel area, but not with median <b>metaxylem</b> area or number of <b>metaxylem</b> vessels (Table 2).

40|$|Establishment {{of maize}} {{seedlings}} {{can be difficult}} at low soil moisture content. Anatomy of root <b>metaxylem</b> vessels may influence the capacity for water transport and respective genotypic differences might be useful for selection purposes. To test this, six tropical maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars were grown in large PVC tubes containing a sandy substrate at 5 % (M 5) and 10 % (M 10) moisture contents for 2 weeks. The percentage changes in root diameters due to M 5 was similar for most cultivars but differed for main root types. Root diameters were not consistently related to <b>metaxylem</b> structure, but in a few cases, thin roots had smaller diameter <b>metaxylem</b> vessels. The M 5 treatment {{reduced the number of}} late <b>metaxylem</b> vessels of primary roots by about 0 to 20 %, while effects on nodal roots were slight. Generally, the ratio of cross-sectional areas between late and early <b>metaxylem</b> vessels increased from primary to seminal and nodal roots. Within the cultivar Tuxpefio this ratio was much reduced by M 5. A few cultivars maintained the combined cross-sectional areas of <b>metaxylem</b> vessels at M 5 in some main root types, but only one cultivar could achieve this for the total of cross-sectional areas of <b>metaxylem</b> vessels, calculated over all root axes, by increasing the number of seminal and nodal roots. These anatomical traits seemed to be mostly constitutive with limited response to an actual environment, but they could be decisive for the suitability of a cultivar to an environment with frequent water shortages during seedling establishmen...|$|E
30|$|Total stele area (TSA), {{number of}} late <b>metaxylem</b> vessels, and median <b>metaxylem</b> vessel area (MXA) varied {{somewhat}} with {{distance from the}} root tip, though the direction and extent of variation depended on the genotype (Table  3, Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). TSA and MXA were slightly correlated (r[*]=[*] 0.44). Two of the tropical japonica lines, Moroberekan and Azucena, had the largest <b>metaxylem</b> vessels and larger-than average stele areas. When water conductance was calculated based on the size and number of late <b>metaxylem</b> vessels, the Moroberekan and Azucena had substantially greater water conductance than the other genotypes tested (Fig.  1). Across all genotypes, water conductance was less {{at the base of}} the crown root than at the other sampling positions. Cocodrie had substantially greater water conductance at the sampling position closest to the root tip compared to other sampling positions, but in general, water conductance was equal or less at the 5  cm position compared to 10 and 15  cm.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} {{and growth of}} higher plants is highly dependent on the conduction of water and minerals throughout the plant by xylem vessels. In Arabidopsis roots the xylem is organized as an axis of cell files with two distinct cell fates: the central <b>metaxylem</b> and the peripheral protoxylem. During vascular development, high and low expression levels of the class III HD-ZIP transcription factors promote <b>metaxylem</b> and protoxylem identities, respectively. Protoxylem specification is determined by both mobile, ground tissue-emanating miRNA 165 / 6 species, which downregulate, and auxin concentrated by polar transport, which promotes HD-ZIP III expression. However, the factors promoting high HD-ZIP III expression for <b>metaxylem</b> identity have remained elusive. We show here that auxin biosynthesis promotes HD-ZIP III expression and <b>metaxylem</b> specification. Several auxin biosynthesis genes are expressed in the outer layers surrounding the vascular tissue in Arabidopsis root and downregulation of HD-ZIP III expression accompanied by specific defects in <b>metaxylem</b> development is seen in auxin biosynthesis mutants, such as trp 2 - 12, wei 8 tar 2 or a quintuple yucca mutant, and in plants treated with L-kynurenine, a pharmacological inhibitor of auxin biosynthesis. Some of the patterning defects can be suppressed by synthetically elevated HD-ZIP III expression. Taken together, our results indicate that polar auxin transport, which was earlier shown to be required for protoxylem formation, {{is not sufficient to}} establish a proper xylem axis but that root-based auxin biosynthesis is additionally required...|$|E
30|$|The {{effect of}} drought on number of late <b>metaxylem</b> vessels varied among cultivars, and the median <b>metaxylem</b> vessel area varied in the basal segment under drought (Fig.  10, Additional file 5 : Figure S 4). Kadam et al. (2015) found no {{significant}} effect of drought on <b>metaxylem</b> diameter or number at several nodal root positions in three rice cultivars, but others have found that some rice cultivars had smaller vessels when exposed to drought (Yambao et al. 1992; Mostajeran and Rahimi-Eichi 2008; Henry et al. 2012). Smaller vessels would be expected protect the xylem from cavitation, moderate water movement to the shoot, and help maintain a moist rhizosphere for continued root growth and water and nutrient uptake. Plasticity of vessel size could be useful to provide these advantages under drought while permitting adequate water transport to the shoot to support rapid growth under well-watered conditions.|$|E
30|$|A {{reproducible}} {{pattern of}} vessel formation can be deduced via analysis of serial transverse {{sections of the}} radicle [71]. The pericycle cells are first observed, followed by the central <b>metaxylem</b> cell appearing just above the CCs after the first anticlinal division of the central <b>metaxylem</b> initial (Fig.  9 a). Phloem sieve element formation occurs in three steps. The first visible mother cell is adjacent to two pericycle cells (Fig.  9 B 1). An anticlinal division generates the metaphloem cell together with an undifferentiated cell (labeled mp and o, respectively, in Fig.  9 B 2,B 3). Next, the undifferentiated cell undergoes two successive asymmetrical cell divisions, and the small cells form the companion cells surrounding a single protophloem cell (Fig.  9 B 4,B 5). Note {{that none of the}} adjacent pericycle cells seem to divide during phloem sieve element formation. Protophloem differentiates first, followed by differentiation of the metaphloem and its two companion cells (Fig.  9 B 5,B 6). <b>Metaxylem</b> vessels originate via cell divisions of an initial cell adjacent to two pericycle cells (Fig.  9 C 1,C 2). Soon after, and concomitantly with metaphloem formation, the development of a set of anticlinal and periclinal divisions surrounding the growing <b>metaxylem</b> vessel (Fig.  9 C 3 –C 7) is visible, forming a single layer of small cells around the xylem vessel (Fig.  9 C 8). Just after <b>metaxylem</b> formation (Fig.  9 C 3), several periclinal and anticlinal divisions of the adjacent pericycle cells are visible and produce a small set of cells (Fig.  9 C 4 –C 8) that are distinct from the remaining pericycle cells. These cells will then differentiate into protoxylem.|$|E
30|$|There {{were several}} {{unexpected}} correlations between architectural and anatomical traits, e.g. <b>metaxylem</b> vessel number {{was positively correlated}} with both small and large lateral root length, but negatively correlated with maximum root depth (Table 1). In a previous study of 15 rice cultivars, <b>metaxylem</b> vessel number was significantly correlated with small lateral root length under low phosphorus, but not high phosphorus conditions (Vejchasarn et al. 2016). Studies with a greater number of genotypes would be required to resolve whether these correlations are typical of rice germplasm and have functional significance.|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} auxins indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) and of the auxin-interacting {{phytohormone}} ethylene, on the ectopic {{formation of}} primary xylem (xylogenesis in planta) is still little known. In particular, auxin/ethylene-target tissue(s), modality of the xylary process (trans-differentiation vs. de novo formation), {{and the kind of}} ectopic elements formed (<b>metaxylem</b> vs. protoxylem) are currently unknown. It is also unclear whether IBA may act on the process independently of conversion into IAA. To investigate these topics, histological analyses were carried out in the hypocotyls of Arabidopsis wild type seedlings and ech 2 ibr 10 and ein 3 eil 1 mutants, which are blocked in IBA-to-IAA conversion and ethylene signalling, respectively. The seedlings were grown under darkness with either IAA or IBA, combined or not with the ethylene precursor 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid. Adventitious root formation was also investigated because this process may compete with xylogenesis. Our results show that ectopic formation of protoxylem and <b>metaxylem</b> occurred as an indirect process starting from the pericycle periclinal derivatives of the hypocotyl basal part. IAA favoured protoxylem formation, whereas IBA induced ectopic <b>metaxylem</b> with ethylene cooperation through the EIN 3 EIL 1 network. Ectopic <b>metaxylem</b> differentiation occurred independently of IBA-to-IAA conversion as mediated by ECH 2 and IBR 10, and in the place of IBA-induced adventitious root formation...|$|E

Nodal root stele area was negatively correlated with small lateral root branching density and positively correlated with maximum root depth. While median <b>metaxylem</b> vessel area {{was positively correlated with}} tiller number, it was not correlated with shoot biomass or <b>metaxylem</b> vessel number.

40|$|It was {{reported}} that wheat cultivars with reduced <b>metaxylem</b> diameters in roots produced higher grain yields compared to those with larger <b>metaxylem</b> diameters under drought conditions, but not under well-watered conditions. Multiple dosages of rye 1 RS translocations in wheat were reported to reduce root <b>metaxylem</b> diameter. The dosage number of 1 RS translocations was inversely proportional to the root <b>metaxylem</b> diameter. Two greenhouse experiments and a field experiment were carried out at University of California, Riverside in 2012 and 2013 under well-watered and terminal drought treatments to test whether translocation lines of wheat cv. Pavon 76 containing 1 (RA 1), 2 (RA 2 and RD 2), and 4 dosages (RAD 4) of 1 RS produced higher grain yields than the control with zero dosage (R 0) under terminal drought. Drought in the field experiment reduced grain yield significantly. Grain yield of RA 2 (23. 9 g- 1) was significantly greater than those of RD 2 (20. 6 g- 1) and RAD 4 (17. 3 g- 1) under well-watered field conditions. Also, grain yield of RAD 4 was significantly less than those of RA 1, R 0, and RD 2 under well-watered conditions. Under drought field conditions, only significant difference in grain yield was found between RA 1 (14. 7 g- 1) and RAD 4 (12. 4 g- 1). Harvest index was significantly greater in well watered (44. 2 %) than in droughted (34. 6 %) field conditions. On average, genotype R 1 (42. 3 %) and RA 2 (40. 6 %) had higher harvest index than RD 2 (38. 3 %) and DAR 4 (35. 5 %) in the field. Also, R 0 (40. 2) and RD 2 (38. 3) had higher harvest index than DAR 4. In general, Pavon 1 RS. 1 AL carrying double doses of 1 RS showed higher grain yields under wet treatments. Pavon 1 RS. 1 AL- 1 RS. 1 DL carrying four doses of 1 RS produced largest shoot and root biomasses, but relatively had least grain yield.

40|$|Woody stems {{that have}} {{completed}} some maturation of <b>metaxylem</b> elements {{should not be}} capable of further axial extension ("secondary stem lengthening"). However, this mechanism has been claimed by Renninger and Phillips (American Journal of Botany 99 : 607 – 613) to be {{a feature of the}} palm Iriartea deltoidea. In response, we describe structural features of palm stems based on extensive known features of their anatomy and development. In addition to the inability of <b>metaxylem</b> vessels to extend after they are mature, fully differentiated fibers of the vascular bundle sheath, which would exist at the time of proposed stem elongation would not be capable of belated extension. "Vessel spirals" claimed by these authors to be capable of stretching to accommodate secondary stem lengthening does not refer to well-established features of the course of vascular bundles. The approach adopted by Renninger and Phillips simply measures stems of different sizes as an implied developmental series. Consequently, results do not take into account changes {{in the development of the}} palm stem as it ages.

In addition, GRP 1. 8 was detected in phloem using tissue printing. The labeled primary walls of dead protoxylem cells showed a characteristically dispersed ultrastructure, resulting from the action of hydrolases during the final steps of cell maturation and from mechanical stress due to hypocotyl growth. Primary walls of living protoxylem and adjacent parenchyma cells were only weakly labeled. This was true also for the secondary walls of proto- and <b>metaxylem</b> cells, which in addition showed high background labeling. Inhibition of lignification with a specific and potent inhibitor of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase {{did not lead to}} enhanced labeling of secondary walls, showing that lignin does not mask the presence of GRP 1. 8 in these walls. Dictyosomes of living proto- and <b>metaxylem</b> cells were not labeled, but dictyosomes of xylem parenchyma cells without secondary walls, adjacent to strongly labeled protoxylem elements, were clearly labeled.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS In Mediterranean-type environments, {{effective}} {{capture of}} intermittent rainfall {{is important for}} crop drought tolerance. Two wheat genotypes RAC 875 and Kukri differing in drought tolerance vary in several shoot traits and grain yield. Little is known about root traits contributing to drought tolerance. This study examined dynamic root responses to cyclic drought in these two contrasting genotypes. METHODS A pot experiment was conducted by exposing plants to moderate drought before heading, and then rewatering. Root responses were determined for coarse and fine root length density (RLD), root DNA concentration (RDC), nodal root properties, and <b>metaxylem</b> and protoxylem features of both primary and nodal roots in proximal and distal regions. RESULTS Moderate drought reduced fine RLD and inhibited new nodal root growth. Rewatering promoted new nodal root growth. Drought-tolerant RAC 875 showed higher relative growth of newly emerged nodal roots than drought-intolerant Kukri after rewatering. RAC 875 also had smaller diameter and total area of <b>metaxylem</b> vessels in nodal roots than Kukri, but higher number of <b>metaxylem</b> vessels and RDC independent of water regime. CONCLUSIONS Multiple root traits identified could confer RAC 875 advantage in drought tolerance under Mediterranean-type environments through conservative use of water and reduced risk of embolism, rapid responses to rainfall and root survival.

Recent studies in Arabidopsis and rice have revealed a key role for CLEs in mediating cell-cell communication and stem cell maintenance during plant development, but how CLE signalling controls root development in the rice remains largely unknown. Here it is shown that exogenous application of a synthetic dodeca-amino acid peptide corresponding to the CLE motif of the rice FON 2 -LIKE CLE PROTEIN 2 (FCP 2 p) protein or overexpression of FCP 2 terminates root apical meristem (RAM) activity and impairs late <b>metaxylem</b> formation.

These results together suggest that in rice RAM maintenance and late <b>metaxylem</b> development are probably controlled by the mutual regulation between FCP 2 and QHB.
