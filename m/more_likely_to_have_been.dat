5|$|Factors such as hypoxia and infection, or {{stress and}} {{malnutrition}} {{in the mother}} during fetal development, {{may result in a}} slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life. People diagnosed with schizophrenia are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> born in winter or spring (at least in the northern hemisphere), which may be a result of increased rates of viral exposures in utero. The increased risk is about five to eight percent. Other infections during pregnancy or around the time of birth that may increase the risk include Toxoplasma gondi and Chlamydia.|$|E
5|$|Three {{mainstream}} narratives emerged {{after the}} shooting. The early view that Israeli gunfire {{had killed the}} boy developed into the position that, because of the trajectory of the shots, Palestinian gunfire was <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> responsible. This view was expressed in 2005 by Denis Jeambar, editor-in-chief of L'Express, and , a former France2 correspondent, who viewed the raw footage. A third perspective, held by Arlette Chabot, France 2's news editor, {{is that no one}} can know who fired the shots.|$|E
5|$|Plays {{were being}} {{performed}} while Corder was still awaiting trial, and an anonymous author published a melodramatic {{version of the}} murder after the execution, a precursor of the Newgate novels which quickly became best-sellers. The Red Barn Murder was a popular subject, along {{with the story of}} Jack Sheppard and other highwaymen, thieves and murderers, for penny gaffs, cheap plays performed in the back rooms of public houses. James Catnach sold more than a million broadsides (sensationalist single sheet newspapers) which gave details of Corder's confession and the execution, and included a sentimental ballad supposedly written by Corder himself (though <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the work of Catnach or somebody in his employ). It was one of at least five ballads about the crime that appeared directly following the execution.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} R. R. Darlington {{argued that}} the Vita was written right after Æthelwig's death, but another historian, David Knowles, wrote that it probably was written about 1110, possibly by the prior of Evesham, Dominic. Antonia Gransden, another historian, agrees with Darlington, and finds it <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> written shortly after Æthelwig's death. The work itself is not a hagiography, in that it doesn't attribute any miracles to Æthelwig, and instead {{is a mix of}} charters and narratives. Nor does it give any details on Æthelwig's early life or his selection as abbot. A large portion of the work is a detailed list of lands acquired by Æthelwig for the abbey, and concludes with a short description of the abbott's death.|$|E
5|$|The inner {{boundary}} of the debris disk was estimated at 11″±2″, or 70–100AU. The disk of dust is produced as radiation pressure from Vega pushes debris from collisions of larger objects outward. However, continuous production {{of the amount of}} dust observed over the course of Vega's lifetime would require an enormous starting mass—estimated as hundreds of times the mass of Jupiter. Hence it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> produced {{as the result of a}} relatively recent breakup of a moderate-sized (or larger) comet or asteroid, which then further fragmented as the result of collisions between the smaller components and other bodies. This dusty disk would be relatively young on the time scale of the star's age, and it will eventually be removed unless other collision events supply more dust.|$|E
5|$|Formby {{began to}} develop his own stage act during the 1890s, and built a large fan base in Lancashire. He devised several {{characters}} with their own costumes, and composed a series of comic songs. By 1896 his assignment book records that he was buying and collecting comic songs and securing the singing rights. He was billed as J.H. Booth until 1897, when he changed his stage name to George Formby. Although rumoured to have picked his new surname after seeing it as a destination on a railway carriage, the main sources agree this story {{is likely to be}} apocryphal. The origin of the Formby name is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a suggestion from Dennis Clarke, the manager of the Argyle Theatre in Birkenhead, while George was chosen in honour of the music hall star George Robey. Formby first used his new stage name in Birkenhead in 1897.|$|E
30|$|Women with {{recurrent}} EP were unsurprisingly significantly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had previous tubal {{surgery or}} previous pelvic surgery (Table  2).

It is noteworthy that women with recurrent EP were not significantly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had previous pelvic inflammatory disease (Table  2).|$|R
50|$|According to a 2006 Australian survey, LGBT Australians, {{compared}} to the general Australian population, were much <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no religious affiliation, much less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be affiliated with a Christian denomination, and <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be affiliated with a non-Christian religion. The distribution of religions that LGBT Australians were raised in, however, {{was similar to that}} of the general population. Men, particularly bisexual men, were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be Christian and <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> stayed in the same religion.

5|$|More recent {{research}} has focused on chess as mental training; the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices; blindfold chess; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much {{recent research}}. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess. Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example, Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> born in late winter and early spring. Compared to general population, chess players {{are more likely to be}} non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.|$|E
5|$|On lap 37, Trulli and Nico Rosberg were {{battling for}} {{position}} going into turn 1. Both span {{off the track}} in almost synchronised fashion without touching each other. This occurrence amused reporters due to it resembling a form of dance. Both drivers were able to keep going. Also on this lap Anthony Davidson made an unscheduled pit stop. He claimed after the race that a beaver had damaged his front wing although Canadian reports said it <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a groundhog. One lap later David Coulthard was forced to retire due to a gearbox problem. Ralf Schumacher also stopped on this lap and this allowed Massa, Fisichella and Sato to move ahead of both of them. Räikkönen had his second pit stop on lap 52 {{at the same time}} as Alonso. The latter was able to pass him just after they had exited the pits side-by-side. This moved him into 5th.|$|E

30|$|As {{can be seen}} in Table  6, {{there are}} {{significant}} differences between the characteristics of the head of split households that were found, and those that attrited.

Attrited split households were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a new head age 35 – 64, and less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a new head 15 – 24 or 25 – 34.

25|$|All of {{the native}} Drosophila and Scaptomyza species in Hawaii have {{apparently}} descended from a single ancestral species that colonized the islands, probably 20 million years ago.
