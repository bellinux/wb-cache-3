40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} the Maillard reaction for food quality and focuses on flavour compound formation. The most important classes of <b>Maillard</b> <b>flavour</b> compounds are indicated and it is shown where they are formed in the Maillard reaction. Some emphasis is given on the kinetics of formation of flavour compounds. It is concluded that the essential elements for predicting the formation of flavour compounds in the Maillard reaction are now established but much more work needs to be done on specific effects such as the amino acid type, the pH, water content and interactions in the food matrix. It is also concluded that most work is done on free amino acids but hardly anything on peptides and proteins, which could generate peptide- or protein-specific flavour compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{melamine}} on Maillard reaction were investigated in chemical model systems. The reaction {{products in the}} model systems with/without melamine were analysed by GC-MS and LC-MS/MS. Impact of melamine on Maillard browning in the above models was also examined by colourimetric methods. It was found that melamine can react directly with lactose and Strecker aldehydes formed in Maillard reactions to produce new adducts. In addition, the presence of melamine in chemical model systems also affects the formation of <b>Maillard</b> <b>flavours</b> and browning. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|<b>Maillard</b> {{reaction}} produces <b>flavour</b> and aroma during cooking process; {{and it is}} used {{almost everywhere}} from the baking industry to our day to day life to make food tasty. It is often called nonenzymatic browning reaction since it {{takes place in the}} absence of enzyme. When foods are being processed or cooked at high temperature, chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars leads to the formation of Maillard reaction products (MRPs). Depending on the way the food is being processed, both beneficial and toxic MRPs can be produced. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} understand the different types of MRPs and their positive or negative health effects. In this review we have summarized how food processing effects MRP formation in some of the very common foods...|$|R
