2500|$|In 1947 Bell Labs was {{the first}} to propose a {{cellular}} radio telephone network. The primary innovation was the development of a network of small overlapping cell sites supported by a call switching infrastructure that tracks users as they move through a network and passes their calls from one site to another without dropping the connection. In 1956 the MTA system was launched in Sweden. The early efforts to develop mobile telephony faced two significant challenges: allowing a great number of callers to use the comparatively few available frequencies simultaneously and allowing users to seamlessly move from one area to another without having their calls dropped. [...] Both problems were solved by Bell Labs employee Amos Joel who, in 1970 applied for a patent for a <b>mobile</b> <b>communications</b> <b>system.</b> [...] However, a business consulting firm calculated the entire U.S. market for mobile telephones at 100,000 units and the entire worldwide market at no more than 200,000 units based on the ready availability of pay telephones and the high cost of constructing cell towers. [...] As a consequence, Bell Labs concluded that the invention was [...] "of little or no consequence," [...] leading it not to attempt to commercialize the invention. [...] The invention earned Joel induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008. [...] The first call on a handheld mobile phone was made on April 3, 1973 by Martin Cooper, then of Motorola to his opposite number in Bell Labs who were also racing to be first.

5000|$|In 1968, FCC {{regulators}} intervened {{when the}} Bell System tried {{to prevent a}} <b>mobile</b> <b>communications</b> <b>system,</b> the Carterfone, from connecting to telephone lines. That decision established the principle that customers could connect any lawful device to the telephone network, even to offer a competing service. In the mid 1970s, emerging long distance competitors like MCI and Sprint faced the same tactic of denying interconnection, which regulators quashed, followed {{by a series of}} efforts by the Bell System phone companies to escalate the costs of interconnection as an indirect means of excluding competition. These battles resulted a large amount of antitrust litigation and ultimately led to the 1982 breakup of the Bell System. In 1982, AT&T and the Justice Department agreed on tentative terms for settlement of anti-trust suit filed against AT&T in 1974, under which AT&T divested itself of its local telephone operations, which became known as the [...] "Baby Bells."
