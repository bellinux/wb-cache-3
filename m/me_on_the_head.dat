2500|$|Crazy Horse spoke {{this story}} to Flying Hawk: â€˜I {{was sitting on a}} hill or rise, and {{something}} touched <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> [...] I felt for it and found {{it was a bit of}} grass. I took it to look at. [...] There was a trail nearby and I followed it. [...] It led to water. [...] I went into the water. There the trail ended and I sat down in the water. [...] I was nearly out of breath. I started to rise out of the water, and when I came out I was born by my mother. When I was born I could know and see and understand for a time, but afterwards went back to it as a baby. [...] Then I grew up naturally. [...] At the age of seven I began to learn, and when twelve began to fight enemies. That was the reason I always refused to wear any war-dress. [...] Only a bit of grass in the hair. [...] That was why I always was successful in battles. The first fight was with the Shoshones. The Shoshones were chasing the Sioux. [...] I, with my younger brother riding double. [...] Two of the Shoshones came for us. [...] We started to meet them. [...] I killed one of them and took his horse. [...] We jumped on him, my brother and I double, and escaped." ...|$|E
60|$|A package {{weighing}} about a ton hit <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> {{and burst}} like a bomb.|$|E
60|$|She {{was much}} gratified; and both her hands being occupied, patted <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with her whip.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ere now," [...] said Huish, [...] "I'll {{give you}} my ultimytum. Go or st'y w'ere you are; I don't mind; I'm goin' to see that man and chuck this vitriol in his eyes. If you st'y I'll go alone; the niggers will likely knock <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>'ead,</b> and a fat lot you'll be the better! But there's one thing sure: I'll 'ear no more of your moonin' mullygrubbin' rot, and tyke it stryte." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, {{seeing my}} face, which I doubt not was startled enough, {{she seemed to}} repent of her haste and patted <b>me</b> gently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Be {{ready to}} follow me," [...] cried Yva again, and we rose to our feet, that is, Bickley and I did, but poor Bastin was semi-comatose. The stone stopped and Yva sprang from it {{to a rock}} {{platform}} level with which it lay. We followed, dragging Bastin between us. As we did so something hit <b>me</b> gently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> It was Bastin's lamp, which I seized.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a lord at all, Meinik. I am {{simply an}} English officer, and dressed {{very much the}} same as I was when your people knocked <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> at Ramoo." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'T was I, Fred Emerson Brooks, the bard; [...] And {{he knocked}} <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> [...] O Lord! I thought it {{exceedingly}} hard, [...] For I didn't {{want to be}} dead.|$|E
6000|$|And Mohammed answered: 'While {{the sheep}} were grazing, robbers came and drove them away, and because I tried to prevent them, they struck <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and bound my hands. See how bloody I am!' ...|$|E
60|$|With a {{twist of}} his thick lips, he rolled the evil-smelling cigar he was smoking from the left {{corner of his mouth}} to the right; and held out a fat and not too clean hand, which, as it closed round mine, brought to my mind the picture of the walrus in my natural history book; with the other he flapped <b>me</b> kindly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yus,' {{she went}} on, 'thet's {{a man for}} yer. Of course, I wasn't goin' ter stand there an' see my {{daughter}} bein' knocked abaht; it wasn't likely--was it? An' 'e rounds <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> an' 'e 'its me with 'is fist. Look 'ere.' She pulled up her sleeves and showed two red and brawny arms. ''E's bruised my arms; I thought 'e'd broken it at fust. If I 'adn't put my arm up, 'e'd 'ave got <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>'ead,</b> an' 'e might 'ave killed me. An' I says to 'im, [...] "If you touch me again, I'll go ter the police-station, thet I will!" [...] Well, that frightened 'im a bit, an' then didn't I let 'im 'ave it! [...] "You call yerself a man," [...] says I, [...] "an' you ain't fit ter clean the drains aht." [...] You should 'ave 'eard the language 'e used. [...] "You dirty old woman," [...] says 'e, [...] "you go away; you're always interferin' with me." [...] Well, I don't like ter repeat wot 'e said, and thet's the truth. An' I says ter 'im, [...] "I wish yer'd never married my daughter, an' if I'd known you was like this I'd 'ave died sooner than let yer."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I am; there." [...] But as {{she said}} this she smiled. [...] "The truth is, I thought I was getting the better of you, and you turned round and gave <b>me</b> a pat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> to show <b>me</b> {{that you could be}} master when it pleased you. You have defended your {{intelligence}} at the expense of your good-nature." ...|$|R
60|$|And then {{everything}} broke loose. Somebody got {{me by the}} collar, somebody else hit <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with a parasol, and somebody else kicked me in the ribs. Everybody talked and shouted at the same time.|$|E
6000|$|MARY. Sir Nicholas! I am stunn'd--Nicholas Heath? Methought some traitor smote <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> What said you, my good Lord, {{that our}} brave English Had sallied out from Calais and driven back The Frenchmen from their trenches? ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. I heard a cry {{for help}} too. I was just coming along. I nipped out of my {{rickshaw}} and sprinted like hell. I saw some fellows struggling. I think someone hit <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> I don't remember much.|$|E
6000|$|... "What he can do, he will do," [...] {{said the}} parson. [...] "He even {{gave me a}} bad name, no doubt; but I fancy he was generous enough to me in that way before yesterday. He will now declare that I am the Evil One himself, and people won't believe that. A {{continued}} persistent enmity, always at work, but kept within moderate bounds, is more dangerous now-a-days, than a hot fever of revengeful wrath. The Marquis can't send out his men-at-arms and have <b>me</b> knocked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> or cast into a dungeon. He can only throw mud at me, and the more he throws at once, the less will reach me." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> journey I {{sat next}} to an {{exceptionally}} large and heavy man, who in his sleep--and he slept often--imagined {{me to be a}} piece of stuffing out of place. Then, grunting and wriggling, he would endeavour to rub me out, until the continued irritation of my <b>head</b> between <b>the</b> window and his back would cause him to awake, when he would look down upon me reprovingly but not unkindly, observing to the carriage generally: [...] "It's a funny thing, ain't it, nobody's ever made a boy yet that could keep still for ten seconds." [...] After which he would pat <b>me</b> heartily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> to show he was not vexed with me, and fall to sleep again upon me. He was a good-tempered man.|$|R
60|$|FAG Assuredly, sir, {{your father}} is wrath to a degree; he comes down stairs eight or ten steps at a time--muttering, growling, and thumping the {{banisters}} all the way: I and the cook's dog stand bowing at the door--rap! he gives <b>me</b> a stroke <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with his cane; bids me carry that to my master; then kicking the poor turnspit into the area, damns us all, for a puppy triumvirate!--Upon my credit, sir, were I in your place, and found my father such very bad company, I should certainly drop his acquaintance.|$|R
60|$|I {{had made}} my mind up in a moment, and {{by way of}} answer told him {{the whole story of}} our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves. He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had done he patted <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you must}} have it, all right. He got cheeky and hit <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with an oar. Then I hit back and knocked him down. Then he got mad and so did Jerry Tolman, and both refused {{to come back in}} the boat with Baxter and me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, [...] "I {{should like}} to {{understand}} what all this means. You were going to tap <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with this particularly unpleasant weapon, and your motive was not robbery. I am not aware of ever having seen you before. I am not aware of having an enemy in the world. Explain yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{left that}} hospitable place about nine o'clock, Mr. Robertson having {{written a letter}} to Colonel Daniel Boone,--shut up in the fort at Boonesboro,--should we be so {{fortunate}} as to reach Kaintuckee: and another to a young gentleman {{by the name of}} George Rogers Clark, apparently a leader there. Captain Sevier bowed over Polly Ann's hand {{as if she were a}} great lady, and wished her a happy honeymoon, and <b>me</b> he patted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and called a brave lad. And soon we had passed beyond the corn-field into the Wilderness again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} was a rival. His name was Motomoe. He was the very highest chief blood next to King John's. He was full native, a strapping, {{handsome}} man, with a glowering way of showing his dislikes. He certainly glowered at me when I began hanging around the palace. He went back in my history and circulated the blackest tales about me. The worst {{of it was that}} most of them were true. He even made a voyage to Apia to find things out--as if he couldn't find a plenty right there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach of Manatomana! And he sneered at my failing for religion, and at my going to prayer- meeting, and, most of all, at my sugar-planting. He challenged me to fight, and I kept off of him. He threatened me, and I learned {{in the nick of time}} of his plan to have <b>me</b> knocked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> You see, he wanted the Princess just as much as I did, and I wanted her more.|$|R
60|$|At last he evidently {{decided that}} there was no danger lurking about. He was {{returning}} from <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of <b>the</b> run-way, from where he had taken a peep down at the drinking-place. His course brought him near, but still he did not notice me. He proceeded casually on his way until abreast of me, and then, without warning and with incredible swiftness, he smote <b>me</b> a buffet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> I was knocked backward fully a dozen feet before I fetched up against the ground, and I remember, half-stunned, even as the blow was struck, hearing the wild uproar of clucking and shrieking laughter that arose from the caves. It was a great joke--at least in that day; and right heartily the Folk appreciated it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Motomoe sprang forward involuntarily, and the sneer was chased {{from his}} face by an {{expression}} of solicitude. Then {{the beauty of the}} situation dawned on him, and he chuckled and grinned. No, I didn't expect anything of him. Hadn't he tried to knock <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head?</b> What could he do anyway? He didn't know anything about engines.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish {{he would}} take me with him, and that a ball would knock <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and finish me," [...] groaned Harry. [...] "You speak to me, Hetty, {{as though it were}} my fault that I am not in the army, when you know I would give--give, forsooth, what have I to give?--yes! my life to go on service!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They did knock <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> {{and very}} hard too, Captain Dave. If my skull hadn't been quite so thick, I should, as you say, have been food for fishes before now, {{for that is}} what they meant me for, and there is no thanks to them that I am here at present. I am sorry that you have all been made so uncomfortable about me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, sir, {{it is just}} this: I {{have left}} Slippen. You see, it was this way: I was a-watching a female party and she wur a good sort. I got up as a {{crossing}} sweeper, and she never went across without giving me a penny and speaking kind like, and one day she sent me out a plate of victuals; so I didn't much like the job, and when Slippen wanted me to say I had seen {{a bit more than}} I had, I up and told him as I wasn't going to. Then he gave <b>me</b> a cuff <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and I gave him some cheek, and he told me to take myself out of it and never let him see my face again, so you see here I am.' ...|$|R
50|$|ME GUSTA: This is {{the first}} video to step outside of the normal {{structure}} of the average Enchufe.tv sketch. In this video whenever someone likes a particular thing or situation they are ambushed by a character with the well-known meme rage comic ME GUSTA face in place of their head. This character is always accompanied by the same song, and after spitting on a normal personâ€™s face with the rage comic LOL face, the normal person is transformed into {{the same kind of}} ME GUSTA character as the original one {{from the beginning of the}} video. After the transformation they both dance in the same peculiar manner. At the end a lady who happens to be cooking hits <b>the</b> <b>ME</b> GUSTA guy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with a pan after she expresses her liking of what she was doing. The ME GUSTA guy is left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor with blood on his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{boy who was}} a bit {{taller than}} I ran against me and {{declared}} {{that it was my}} fault, and gave <b>me</b> a cuff <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> I might have run away, and of course I ought to have done so, but I was angry, for he really hurt me; so I had to do what any boy would have done, and I flew at him so fiercely, and cuffed and scratched and kicked so savagely that at last he turned and ran. He had hit me too, but I did not feel it at the time, and next morning I was all sorts of colours round the eyes. Father was very angry, but when I asked what else he would have done if he had been cuffed, he could not tell me. I had a very important message to carry that morning for him. At first he said I could not go out in that state; but, as I told him, I had never looked so much like a boy before." ...|$|R
6000|$|Tom reddened a bit, {{and then}} put his {{forefinger}} to his forehead. [...] "You mean it would help me here?" [...] And then, as Sam nodded, he added: [...] "Oh, don't you worry. I am all right now, my head doesn't bother me a bit. But I do wish I could get just one good chance at Pelter for the crack that rascal gave <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with the footstool." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep off--don't get {{in front}} of him," [...] said Sam, in a warning voice. [...] "He mayn't have {{recovered}} self-restraint enough yet to refrain from grasping you. Guide me to the raft, Robin, while I swim on my back, and see that you don't let it hit <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> when I come close. You and Slagg help each other on, and then help me with Stumps." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes!--all of them. Even Gaspard is kind now. He never whips Chimo, and {{he patted}} <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> {{the other day}} when I met him alone in the ravine--the berry ravine, you know, where I go to gather berries. I wonder if there are berries in all the other ravines?--but I don't care much, for there are {{thousands}} and thousands of all kinds in my own ravine, and--where are you going, papa?" ...|$|E
60|$|I walked it on foot, with my old {{pilot in}} company, and a Chinese, being desirous, forsooth, {{of a little}} variety. When we came to this place, it was a low marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall, piled up dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a park, with a little guard of Chinese {{soldiers}} at the doors. Having bought a camel, and agreed for the price, I came away; and the Chinese man, that went with me, led <b>the</b> camel, when <b>on</b> a sudden came up five Tartars on horseback: two of them seized the fellow, and took the camel from him, while the other three stepped {{up to me and}} my old pilot; seeing us, as it were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about me but my sword, which could but ill defend me against three horsemen. The first that came up stopped short upon my drawing my sword; (for they are arrant cowards) but a second coming upon my left, gave <b>me</b> a blow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> which I never felt till afterwards, and wondered, when I came to myself, what was the matter with me, and where I was, for he laid <b>me</b> flat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground; but my never-failing old pilot, the Portuguese (so Providence, unlooked for, directs deliverances from dangers, which to us are unforeseen,) had a pistol in his pocket, which I knew nothing of nor the Tartars neither; if they had, I suppose they would not have attacked us; but cowards are always boldest when there is no danger.|$|R

He then immediately stepped up to him who had stopped us, as I said, and before he could come forward again, made a blow at him with a scimitar, which he always wore, but missing the man, struck his horse in the side of his head, cut one of the ears off by the root, and a great slice down by the side of his face. The poor beast, enraged with the wound, was no more to be governed by his rider, though the fellow sat well enough too, but away he flew, and carried him quite out of the pilot's reach; and at some distance, rising upon his hind legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell upon him.|$|R
6000|$|Emperors, kings, artisans, peasants, big people, little people--at {{the bottom}} {{we are all}} alike and all the same; all just alike <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inside, and when our clothes are off, nobody can tell which of us is which. We are {{unanimous}} in the pride we take in good and genuine compliments paid us, and distinctions conferred upon us, in attentions shown. There {{is not one of}} us, from the emperor down, but is made like that. Do I mean attentions shown us by the guest? No, I mean simply flattering attentions, let them come whence they may. We despise no source that can pay us a pleasing attention--there is no source that is humble enough for that. You have heard a dear little girl say to a frowzy and disreputable dog: [...] "He came right to me and let <b>me</b> pat him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> and he wouldn't let the others touch him!" [...] and you have seen her eyes dance with pride in that high distinction. You have often seen that. If the child were a princess, would that random dog be able to confer the like glory upon her with his pretty compliment? Yes; and even in her mature life and seated upon a throne, she would still remember it, still recall it, still speak of it with frank satisfaction. That charming and lovable German princess and poet, Carmen Sylva, Queen of Roumania, remembers yet that the flowers of the woods and fields [...] "talked to her" [...] when she was a girl, and she sets it down in her latest book; and that the squirrels conferred upon her and her father the valued compliment of not being afraid of them; and [...] "once one of them, holding a nut between its sharp little teeth, ran right up against my father"--it has the very note of [...] "He came right to me and let <b>me</b> pat him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head"--"and when it saw itself reflected in his boot it was very much surprised, and stopped {{for a long time to}} contemplate itself in the polished leather"--then it went its way. And the birds! she still remembers with pride that [...] "they came boldly into my room," [...] when she had neglected her [...] "duty" [...] and put no food <b>on</b> <b>the</b> window-sill for them; she knew all the wild birds, and forgets <b>the</b> royal crown <b>on</b> her head to remember with pride that they knew her; also that the wasp and the bee were personal friends of hers, and never forgot that gracious relationship to her injury: [...] "never have I been stung by a wasp or a bee." [...] And here is that proud note again that sings in that little child's elation in being singled out, among all the company of children, for the random dog's honor-conferring attentions. [...] "Even in the very worst summer for wasps, when, in lunching out of doors, our table was covered with them and every one else was stung, they never hurt me." ...|$|R
