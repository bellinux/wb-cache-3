40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{integration}} of robotic milking in the dairy farm and focusses on the following aspects: (a) required milking capacity of robotic milking units, (b) cow traffic and visits to the milking units and (c) design of total systems. The capacity of a <b>milking</b> <b>stall</b> in milkings per hour depends on the milking time per milking, the occupation time of the <b>milking</b> <b>stall</b> and the accessability of the milking parlour. Based on milk yields of 14. 1, 10. 7 and 8. 1 and 7. 0 min per milking were established. It is expected that because of cows loitering at or obstructing the entry or exit and because of a certain daily pattern in the AMS visits, an effective occupation of about 60 % of the <b>milking</b> <b>stall</b> will be possible. The capacity is then 4. 2, 4. 5 and 5. 2 milkings per hour. It was assumed that an AMS-stall is vailable 20 h per day for milking and 4 h per day for cleaning. For a herd of 100 lactating cows, three times daily milking and an occupation time of the <b>milking</b> <b>stall</b> of 60 % of the available 20 h, four milking stalls are needed. Based on experiences gained in various experiments a lay out is suggested for an automatic milking system with automatic voluntary cow traffic. For automatic milking in a milking parlour with milking of cows in batches (human controlled cow traffic) the number of milking stalls will depend mainly on the chosen group size. For labour reasons this group size should not be too small and may vary between 50 and 100 cows. Based on the requirement {{that a group of}} cows has to be milked within approximately 1 h and an automatic <b>milking</b> <b>stall</b> with a 100 % occupation time, the required number of milking stalls for three times per day milking and for herd sizes of 50, 100 and 200 cows are respectively 6, 6 and 8.

40|$|The {{design of}} a <b>milking</b> <b>stall</b> with special {{functions}} for monitoring and control is described. The milk removal process per quarter is described. The <b>milking</b> <b>stall</b> was equipped with four milk containers, whose advancing weight was recorded permanently. The data were online converted into milk flow rate profiles for each quarter. Quarter milk flow profiles were analysed and translated into variables such as milk yield and milking duration for the whole milking or for the increase, steady state, declining and overmilking phases. These variables were {{used to test the}} effect of technical milking machine settings (pulsation or milking vacuum, pulsation rate or ratio and detachment level) on quarter milking performance. Also the effects of the factors of quarter position and milking time were examined. An experiment with three milking vacuum levels, carried out in a milking parlour with these quarter milking facilities is described. Significant effects of vacuum level, quarter position and time of milking on milk yield and milking duration in the defined milk removal phases were shown. Moreover, the effects differed significantly among cows and quarters. The study reveals marked differences in milk flow profiles per quarter. For optimal milking the milking process control should anticipate these differences and use the information for more efficient milking and safeguarding teat and udder health...|$|E
40|$|Simulation {{models of}} parallel, rotary, and side-opening milking parlors were built that could predict milking parlor {{performance}} according to herd size, number of <b>milking</b> <b>stalls,</b> labor quality, and cow characteristics.

Various scenarios were generated to study parlor performance, and the results indicated that for a parlor with up to 14 <b>milking</b> <b>stalls,</b> a side-opening design provided greater capacity than parallel or rotary parlors. Performance of a side-opening parlor was reduced by enlargement up to 20 <b>milking</b> <b>stalls.</b> For 10 to 40 <b>milking</b> <b>stalls,</b> a rotary design gave better performance than a double parallel design in terms of milking process duration and stall utilization.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the effect of milking pre-partum training on behaviour, milk production and milk flow profile of buffalo heifers. The {{study was conducted in}} the Improsta farm of Campania Region. Fifteen animals aged 30 to 44 months were divided in two groups. Eight animals served as control (group C), whereas 7 animals received in the morning a pre-partum training for at least 7 days (group T). During the pre-partum training sessions, an animal was moved to the milking parlour (tandem 3 x 3) and left for 10 min in the <b>milking</b> <b>stall,</b> where the udder was thoroughly washed and massaged for 1 min. The massage included the stripping of the teats. Once calved, all the heifers were observed in the parlour for their first milking then on 7 occasions (3, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56 days after calving) during afternoon milking. The behaviours, recorded from the entrance in the <b>milking</b> <b>stall</b> to the removal of milking cluster, were step (foot lifted less than 15 cm off of the ground) and kick (foot raised above 15 cm off of the ground, even if a clear kick was not visible). Milk flow profiles were measured with electronic mobile milk flow meters. Milk samples were also collected to assess milk quality (CFU, SCC, lactose, protein, and fat). All variables were analysed with a linear mixed model for repeated measures. Animals of group T performed a lower number of steps (0. 08 - 0. 03 vs 0. 20 - 0. 03 n/min) and kicks(0. 13 - 0. 04 vs 0. 26 - 0. 03 n/min) than C animals. A reduction of number of kicks was observed as the lactation proceeded. Milk quality, milk production and milk flow profile were not affected by treatment.

40|$|Automatic milking systems (AMS) offer a {{potential}} solution {{for some of}} the labour issues faced within the dairy industry, replacing manual labour typically dedicated to milk harvesting with robotics. Subsequently, AMS is able to achieve milkings which are voluntary and distributed (Chapter 2), offering farmers the potential to increase milking frequency and milk yield without increasing labour. Critical to the success of voluntary AMS and the attainment of acceptable milking frequency is the ability to motivate cows to return to the <b>milking</b> <b>stall</b> regularly and evenly throughout the entire 24 hour day, to which feed is commonly used as an incentive to achieve this movement. However, pasture-based systems typically have reduced cow traffic and milk yield, and introduce new challenges to the management of voluntary cow traffic, which have not been experienced in indoor-housed systems where the technology originated. Furthermore, variation in milking frequency and milking interval exists, leading to variation in the utilisation, and therefore demand, of the <b>milking</b> <b>stall</b> throughout the day, with this variation particularly evident in pasture-based operations (Chapter 2). Peaks in demand for the <b>milking</b> <b>stall</b> can increase the risk of congestion and subsequent adverse effects on aspects of cow welfare and system performance, which may be further exacerbated when operating with the newly developed high-throughput robotic rotary (RR) <b>milking</b> <b>stall,</b> to which there is no published research exploring the management of voluntary cow traffic within a RR system. Consequently, the overall objective of this thesis was to increase understanding of factors which may influence voluntary cow traffic, as well as investigate management practices which can be used to encourage cows to volunteer for milking, within a pasture-based RR system. In Chapter, 3 it was demonstrated that the offering of feed at milking on the RR to cows accustomed to being offered feed at milking resulted in these cows more rapidly exiting the premilking area (i. e., being milked), spending approximately half the waiting time they did when feed was not on offer. Similarly, the offering of feed following milking encouraged cows to more quickly volunteer for milking and spend less time in the premilking area than the offer of feed before milking (Chapter 4). Conversely, Chapter 5 reported a lack of response to a shortterm feed incentive in cows that were not accustomed to receiving feed at milking, nor did the offer of a palatable and preferred forage crop grazed at pasture positively ii influence premilking waiting times (Chapter 6). Thus, one of the key findings from this thesis is that the training of cows without a feed incentive at milking is likely to still result in acceptable premilking waiting times. However, reverting away from offering feed at milking once cows are accustomed to feed could lead to significant, adverse effects on congestion, premilking waiting times, cow welfare and system performance and is not a recommended management practice. Chapters 3 and 4 identified that prolonged waiting times still existed despite the offer of feed incentives, and so Chapter 5 also explored the possibility of using a priority area in which cows could be automatically sent to in order to gain direct access to the RR without moving through the queue of cows within the main waiting area. It was observed that premilking waiting times in the priority area were half that of the average waiting time in the main area, providing evidence to support the introduction of priority areas {{in the design of the}} dairy facility. Throughout this thesis, several factors were consistently observed to effect premilking waiting times, including; cow age and production (Chapters 3 to 6), the time of day (Chapters 5 and 6), fetching and forcing cows to wait (Chapters 3 to 6), and the clear presence of a negative effect of increasing queue length (Chapters 3 to 6). Thus, in summary, this thesis contributes significantly to our current understanding of the management of voluntary, pasture-based RR systems, and has also identified factors which can influence premilking waiting times and, subsequently, the risk of congestion. Results from the studies contained within this thesis can be used to co-develop useful, practical and scientifically-based strategies suited to the management of the RR in pasture-based operations.

Geometric parameters of HRV (SD 1 and SD 2) were calculated using Poincare graphs. HRV indices of resting 1 h after midday milking (reference period) were compared to those measured during the different phases of the evening milking (driving; in the holding pen; udder preparation; milking; after milking in the <b>milking</b> <b>stall).</b> There {{was no difference between}} the reference period and the different phases of milking in animal welfare terms. During the reference period SD 2 (198. 5 ms) was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than every other measured period suggesting an increasing parasympathetic tone after milking. This parasympathetic predominance decreased with time of the day (1. 5 h after milking). SD 2 was significantly affected by parity, by the breeding bull (p< 0. 01) and by milk production (p< 0. 05). SD 2 was notably higher (102. 8 ms) in multiparous cows than in primiparous cows (p< 0. 017; α= 0. 005) during resting and milking. Results suggested that a conventional milking process is not really stressful for cows. Primiparous cows were more susceptible of milking process than multiparous ones.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of Automatic Milking Systems (AMS) has created new aspects {{both in the}} planning of dairy cowsheds due to the necessity of directing cow traffic, and in general cow management [...] The aims of this thesis was to study some of these aspects, such as, the effect of feeding frequency on Waiting Time at the AMS, cowshed facility utilization, {{and the effects of}} light Conditioned Reinforcement on the time needed for cows to leave the Automatic Milking Unit (AMU) after a successful milking. In addition, a method to trace cows in a loose housing system and a method to detect cows with deviating locomotion were evaluated. The results of these studies are given in five different papers. In the first experiment it is shown that increasing the forage feeding frequency can substantially reduce the cow waiting time before an AMU. The average waiting time at the AMU when feeding twice per day (08 : 00 and 16 : 00 hrs) was 755 sec. When the feeding frequency was increased to six times per day (00 : 00; 04 : 00; 08 : 00; 12 : 00; 16 : 00 and 20 : 00 h, respectively), the waiting time decreased to 351 sec. The Feeding Activity Factor (the factor describing the number of times a cow was observed at the feeding fence 10 min after a forage supply) was also higher and the cowshed facilities in the waiting area (floor and cubicles) were more evenly used. No significant differences were found when comparing the utilization of the facilities in the cowshed, although the feeding fence tended to be more evenly used when 6 feedings per day were given, in comparison to feeding twice daily. To maximise the number of milkings per day per <b>milking</b> <b>stall,</b> the use of the AMU should be as effective as possible, with the time necessary for the cow to enter and leave the AMU as short as possible. In the second study, the effect of a light Conditioned Reinforcement {{in the form of an}} acoustic signal followed by either a moving tube rubbing the sides of the cow or a flashing light, was studied on the time needed for cows to leave the unit. It was found that the exit time for primiparous cows decreased by 93 - 97 sec. For multiparous cows the exit time decreased by 112 - 168 sec. No negative effect could be found on the time needed for the cows to enter the AMU or on the <b>milking</b> <b>stall</b> visiting pattern. In practise, this meant that 100 and 150 min daily would be available for additional milkings per AMU. In loose housing herds, the tracking of individual cows can provide answers to questions regarding the effect of cowshed layout and managerial practises on behaviour and on health and oestrus status of the animals. In the thesis, a method is described that can automatically track and identify individual cows in a loose house system by optical means. In addition, a method was developed to detect cows with locomotion problems using body weight distribution. While the results were promising for both methods, more studies must be performed before they reach a satisfying level of acceptance...|$|E

The SCC values were determined by the Fluoro-opto-electronic method using the apparatus Fossomatic. A significant factor influencing the SCC was the season. The highest average values of the SCC were found in the summer months. The lowest average values of the SCC were determined in the loose bedded cubicle housing (250. 103. ml- 1), while the difference in the SCC compared to the loose bedding-free slatted floor housing (SCC average 317. 103. ml- 1) was highly statistically significant (p < 0, 001).

40|$|SUMMARY: Complaints that {{electricity}} was affecting behavior, health, {{and milk}} production of dairy cows when voltages {{were less than}} Public Utility Commission (PUC) standards were investigated on 12 farms located in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota. PUCs and utilities in some jurisdictions have adopted 0. 5 volt or 1. 0 milliampere at cow contact as actionable limits below which utilities would not respond to farmer complaints of stray voltage. Using power quality instruments common in the electrical industry, investigators found large numbers of transient electrical impulses, and higher than 60 Hertz frequency har-monics on power lines and in <b>milking</b> <b>stalls.</b> <b>Milk</b> production decreased {{as the number of}} transient events increased and as the sum of step potential voltages> 0. 01 Volt (peak to peak) increased.

40|$|Two {{directions}} can {{be distinguished}} {{in the development of}} high-tech milking equipment: 1) high-capacity milking parlors with a high throughput of cows per person per hour and 2) automatic milking systems in which manual labor is replaced by a milking robot. High-capacity milking parlors are developed {{in such a way that}} one operator is able to milk many cows, partly by automation and partly by optimization of available labor. In such parlors, one operator can milk up to 125 cows per hour. This means that there are only a few seconds available for udder preparation. In an automatic milking system, a robot takes over all manual labor during milking. Currently available systems have one robot arm working with one <b>milking</b> <b>stall</b> (one-stall system) or one robot arm working with more milking stalls (multiple-stall systems). Cows have to go to the automatic milking system voluntarily. Therefore, there is a large variation in milking intervals. Moreover, a large variation between milkings and between cows was observed in milk flow rate, machine-on time and udder preparation time. Both developments in high-tech milking have effects on the milk ejection. The small amount of time dedicated to udder preparation in high-capacity milking parlors has negative effects on the milk ejection, among others leading to more bimodal milk flow curves and longer machine-on time. In automatic milking systems, the variation in time between udder preparation and cluster attachment and in milking frequency might have an effect on milk ejection. Lactation physiology can play a role in solving the questions around milk ejection in high-tech milking systems. The introduction of high-tech milking systems makes decision support systems using sensors necessary. These systems should assist in detection of abnormal milk and mastitis. To a lesser extent, diseased cows need to be brought to the attention of the dairy farmer. Some sensors are currently available for this purpose, but they do not fulfill all demands. In the near future other sensors might be developed. It is important that this development is demand driven and not technology driven. Lactation physiology can play an important role in the determination of milk components useful for automatic detection...|$|E

Sixteen buffalo heifersin late gestation were used for this study. The animals, with an age ranging from 30 to 44 months at the start of the study, were equally allocated into two treatments and bal-anced for estimated calving date. Eight animals received pre-partum habituation for 10 daysbefore the estimated calving date (group H), while the eight others received no treatmentand served as the control (group C). During the pre-partum habituation sessions, group Hanimals were moved to the milking parlour and left for 10 min in the <b>milking</b> <b>stall</b> onceeach day, where the udder was thoroughly washed with warm water, wiped with a dis-posable towel and massaged. The behaviours, registered from entrance into the milkingstall to exit, were step and kick. After calving milk flow profiles, milk yield and milk qual-ity variables were determined along with behavioural recordings. The H animals duringthe habituation procedure showed a reduction in the number of steps (P < 0. 001) and kicks(P < 0. 01). After calving the H animals performed fewer steps than the control animals at 0 (P < 0. 001), 3 (P < 0. 01), 6 (P < 0. 01), 13 (P < 0. 01) and 20 (P < 0. 01) days after calving. Animalsfrom group H also performed fewer kicks than control animals at 0 (P < 0. 001), 3 (P < 0. 01), 6 (P < 0. 01) and 13 (P < 0. 01) days after calving. In the C group a reduction in the numberof steps (P < 0. 001) and kicks (P < 0. 001) was observed as lactation proceeded, whereas forgroup H only a tendency for a reduction over lactation was detected. Pre-partum habitu-ation did not significantly affect milk quality or milk flow variables. Milk yield in the first 3 min of milking (P < 0. 001), and average milk flow (P < 0. 001), increased throughout theexperimental period, whereas the duration of the pre-milking phase decreased as lactationproceeded (P < 0. 001). This study shows that buffalo heifers exposed to a pre-partum habit-uation programme performed fewer steps and kicks than control animals during milking.

25|$|Every time a cow {{enters the}} parlor several {{things need to}} happen to ensure milk quality and cow health. First, the cow’s udder must be cleaned and {{disinfected}} to prevent both milk contamination and udder infections.

During this processes, called stripping the teat, the milking technician is looking for any discoloration or chunkiness that would indicate mastitis, an infection in the cow’s mammary gland. Milk from a cow with mastitis cannot enter the human milk supply, thus farmers must be careful that infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the mastitis inspection, the milking technician will attach the milking cluster. The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off.

Each cow paid on average 2. 8 (SD= 0. 4) milking visits, 2. 5 (SD= 2. 0) non-milking visits, and 0. 7 (SD= 1. 7) milking-failure visits to the AMS daily. In both studies, the type of visit a cow paid to the AMS determined the time interval until her next visit. In study 1, time intervals were: 321 min (SEM= 12) after milking visits, 145 min (SEM= 16) after non-milking visits, 115 min (SEM= 10) after milking-failure visits. In study 2, time intervals were: 337 min (SEM= 14) after milking visits, 117 min (SEM= 17) after non-milking visits, 164 min (SEM= 13) after milking-failure visits. In both studies, cows spent the longest time in the entry area of the AMS during non-milking visits (29 s (SEM= 5) study 1; 33 s (SEM= 3) study 2). Cows left the <b>milking</b> <b>stalls</b> slowest during non-milking visits in study 1 (10 s, SEM= 1), and during milking-failure visits in study 2 (18 s, SEM= 5). They spent the longest time in the exit area of the AMS after non-milking visits in study 1 (202 s, SEM= 23), and after milking-failure visits in study 2 (141 s, SEM= 28). In both studies, they defecated and urinated in the exit area. It was concluded that cows that {{do not need to be}} milked will enter the AMS if there is no selection stall to prevent unwarranted visits, and that cow traffic inside the system is slow. The combination of non-milking visits and slow cow traffic will lower the milking efficiency of the AMS...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNutritional and animal-selection {{strategies}} to mitigate enteric methane (CH 4) depend on accurate, cost-effective methods to determine emissions {{from a large}} number of animals. The objective {{of the present study was}} to compare 2 spot-sampling methods to determine CH 4 emissions from dairy cows, using gas quantification equipment installed in concentrate feeders or automatic <b>milking</b> <b>stalls.</b> In the first method (sniffer method), CH 4 and carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations were measured in close proximity to the muzzle of the animal, and average CH 4 concentrations or CH 4 /CO 2 ratio was calculated. In the second method (flux method), measurement of CH 4 and CO 2 concentration was combined with an active airflow inside the feed troughs for capture of emitted gas and measurements of CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes. A muzzle sensor was used allowing data to be filtered when the muzzle was not near the sampling inlet. In a laboratory study, a model cow head was built that emitted CO 2 at a constant rate. It was found that CO 2 concentrations using the sniffer method decreased up to 39 % when the distance of the muzzle from the sampling inlet increased to 30 cm, but no muzzle-position effects were observed for the flux method. The methods were compared in 2 on-farm studies conducted using 32 (experiment 1) or 59 (experiment 2) cows in a switch-back design of 5 (experiment 1) or 4 (experiment 2) periods for replicated comparisons between methods. Between-cow coefficient of variation (CV) in CH 4 was smaller for the flux than the sniffer method (experiment 1, CV= 11. 0 vs. 17. 5 %, and experiment 2, 17. 6 vs. 28. 0 %). Repeatability of the measurements from both methods were high (0. 72 – 0. 88), but the relationship between the sniffer and flux methods was weak (R 2 = 0. 09 in both experiments). With the flux method CH 4 was found to be correlated to dry matter intake or body weight, but this was not the case with the sniffer method. The CH 4 /CO 2 ratio was more highly correlated between the flux and sniffer methods (R 2 = 0. 30), and CV was similar (6. 4 – 8. 8 %). In experiment 2, cow muzzle position was highly repeatable (0. 82) and influenced sniffer and flux method results when not filtered for muzzle position. It was concluded that the flux method provides more reliable estimates of CH 4 emissions than the sniffer method. The sniffer method appears to be affected by variable air-mixing conditions created by geometry of feed trough, muzzle movement, and muzzle position...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{stochastic}} nature of the usage of facilities in a robotic milking barn, independent of the barn layout. It presents experimental data obtained by monitoring 10 dairy cows over a period of 18 days. To minimize restrictions to the access of cows to the facilities, the barn contained less than half the number of the cows for which it was designed. Under these conditions of maximum availability of facilities, the intensity and sequence of facilities usage were studied. The access to all the facilities in the barn can be approximated by an exponential distribution where the values for the exponential rate for access to concentrates, forage, water, cubicles and milking, respectively, are: conc. of 13 ? 15, forage of 8 ? 77, water of 12 ? 06, cubicles of 8 ? 08, and milking of 15 ? 11. The ‘flow’ of the cows between the facilities was expressed in a transition matrix. The first priority of cows crossing from the resting area to the feeding area through the <b>milking</b> robot <b>stalls</b> was concentrate feeding (91 ? 4 f the events). The occupation rate (cows/positions) of forage lane or cubicles was less than the milking-parlour situation. Robotic milking evened out the usage of all the facilities in the barn throughout day and night to a continuous-time stochastic process...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to analyze the relationship of psychrotrophic lipolytic bacteria in bulk samples of cow?s raw milk and their metabolic activity based on the content of free fatty acids and identifying the factors that may influence their levels. The contents of free fatty acids (FFA) and counts of total bacteria, psychrotrophic lipolytic bacteria (PLiBC) and somatic cells were determined in 150 samples of cow?s bulk raw milk on 20 farms with three different milking technologies in South Bohemia during 2008 ? 10. FFA were determined using an extraction-titration method. Within the compared technologies, the highest mean values of FFA (38, 8 mmol?kg- 1; P< 0, 001) and PLiBC (696 CFU?ml? 1) were observed on farms with pipeline <b>milking</b> in <b>stalls.</b> The lowest mean FFA level (15, 4 mmol?kg- 1) was determined on farms with an automatic milking system. Medium values were determined on farms with parlour milking. From the aspect of the inhibition of an increase in psychrotrophic bacteria, and mainly in psychrotrophic lipolytic bacteria in conditions of cold storage of raw milk the temperature of 4 °C seems optimum as it markedly inhibits the growth of mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria and at the same time the increase in the values of free fatty acids is slower at this temperature compared to the temperatures of 6, 5 and 10 °C...|$|R

40|$|In robotic milking {{there is}} always a slight chance of failure to attach the milking cluster. Attachment failure is most likely for cows whose udder {{conformation}} is less convenient for robot attachment. In general, after milking failure cows try to revisit the milking robot if they are not sent to a separate area. Since it is difficult to estimate the effect of milking failure on such a cow and her welfare in conditions of robotic milking, a specific 16 -day trial was conducted on 12 cows. These cows were milked in a milking parlour with six <b>milking</b> <b>stalls.</b> Each afternoon <b>milking,</b> three cows were not milked. All the cows were closely observed in the cubicle house for 1 h after the afternoon milking. Thereafter, all cows were brought to the milking parlour the third time and the three unmilked cows were milked. In total, each cow was observed 12 times after milking and four times after omitted milking. The following behavioural traits were registered: time budget for the 1 h, occurrence and time until eating, drinking, lying, urination and defecation, and aggressive interactions. Milking order was defined on the basis of how often a cow came to the milking parlour in the first batch of six cows. Moreover, the data related to the milk yield {{and the use of the}} automatic feeding installation with the complete diet were analysed. After omitted milking, only the cows from the first batch stood longer in cubicles (14. 2 min of 1 h) and lay less (5. 4 min of 1 h) than milked cows of the same batch (respectively 7. 0 min and 16. 3 min for standing and lying in cubicles) (P < 0. 01). After omitted milking, cows urinated earlier and more frequently (64. 5 %) than milked cows (36. 3 %) (P < 0. 002) (both batches). There were no statistically significant differences in eating time and feed intake after milking and omitted milking. Milk yield per cow averaged 24. 9 kg during days with omitted (delayed by 1 h) milking and 25. 3 kg during the days without omitted milking (P < 0. 05). It was concluded that cows show some signs of discomfort after omitted milking (urination); this discomfort seemed to be greater in cows coming earlier to the milking parlour (afterwards they preferred to stand rather than to lie). The 60 % of cases of milk leakage found after omitted milking indicates that failed cluster attachment can be accompanied by an extra risk factor for the occurrence of mastitis. However, omitted milking as a treatment did not influence feeding and aggressive behaviour or milking order when unmilked cows were brought to the milking parlour the third time together with the milked cows. Our methods and results can be useful for estimating the effects of robot milking failures on a cow. Future studies should pay particular attention to high-yielding cows and to longer periods of delayed milking. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
