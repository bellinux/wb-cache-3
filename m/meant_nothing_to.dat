5|$|Naz and Asher go {{clubbing}} and {{get drunk}} and high on drugs, and though Sol sends her an apologetic text message, Asher deletes it before Naz sees it. Naz and Asher {{end up having}} sex, but he abandons her afterwards and Sol finds her and apologises. They reconcile but she feels guilty. The next day they wake up after spending {{the night in the}} same bed, and Naz later watches Sol at dance rehearsals. Asher returns a necklace to Naz, and Sol sees this. He confronts her about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> her. She insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. In an attempt to get Naz and Sol to reconcile again, Stevie pretends to swallow the key to the flat's front door, leaving them trapped. Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol angrily says she can stay there. When left alone, they get close again, but Asher interrupts them when he returns. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he sarcastically tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. She returns home and prepares to leave for Turkey but her father discovers she has escaped through a window. She returns to the flat but her father and Ekin come after her and try to take her back home. Sol stops the car and Naz gets out and they kiss. Later at the dance-off, she and her father talk and he finally accepts her choice of boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|Sol and Naz {{spend the}} night {{together}} but at later dance rehearsals, Asher gives Naz her necklace back, and Sol sees this. He confronts Naz about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> her. Sol punches Asher, saying his brother has betrayed him, and a fight breaks out, but is broken up by Skolla and the other dancers. Skolla tells Sol and Asher they are both out {{of the group and}} reveals that Asher bought Sol's place. Sol goes back home to his mother but a neighbour tells him she has been taken away. Back in Walford, Naz insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. Stevie attempts to get them to reconcile by locking them in the flat and pretending to swallow the key, but Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol says she can stay there. Sol and Naz get close again but Asher interrupts them when he returns drunk. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. Asher finds Sol with their mother in hospital, and tells Sol he is better off with him than their mother as she is schizophrenic and has stabbed Asher. Sol says Asher is the problem and leaves. Asher finds him and apologises for Naz and says she did not get Sol's text message because he deleted it, and tells Sol that Naz loves him and he should do something about it. Sol returns to Walford again as Naz is leaving, and stops Ekin's car. Naz gets out and they kiss. Asher tells him he can dance at the dance-off, but when his name is called, he is unsure and calls for Asher, saying he needs him. Asher tells him he can do it on his own. Everyone cheers him after his routine and he is called one of the best dancers.|$|E
25|$|Riis {{said that}} he bought and {{injected}} the EPO himself, and team coach Walter Godefroot {{turned a blind eye}} to the drug use on the team. He denied a passage of Jeff d'Hont's book, where it is related that his hematocrit level was once tested by the team and registered 64%. He said if someone wanted to take his yellow jersey they could do so, it <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> him. Riis was removed from the official record books of Tour de France, but in July 2008 he was written back into the books, along with additional notes about his use of doping.|$|E

60|$|This was {{the clearest}} gain he had out of life. Nothing could rob him {{of this kind}} of fame. The {{piercing}} of the Isthmus of Suez, like the breaking of a dam, had let in upon the East a flood of new ships, new men, new methods of trade. It had changed the face of the Eastern seas and the very spirit of their life; so that his early experiences <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> whatever <b>to</b> the new generation of seamen.|$|R
6000|$|Winton bit {{his lips}} and turned from the wall. The thought of that fellow was bitter within him. She <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> tell him <b>nothing,</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> keep up that lighthearted look--which didn't deceive him a bit! ...|$|R
25|$|From 1932 to 1935, White {{lived in}} England, {{studying}} French and German literature at King's College, Cambridge University. His homosexuality took {{a toll on}} his first term academic performance, {{in part because he}} developed a romantic attraction to a young man who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared not speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> him sexually. That became White's first love affair.|$|E
500|$|... he big {{watershed}} was the Clash album—that was go out, {{cut your}} hair, stop mucking about time, y'know. Up {{to that point}} we'd still been singing about bowling down California highways. I mean, it <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> me. Although the Damned and the Pistols were great, they were only exciting musically; lyrically, I couldn't really make out a lot if it... o realise that [...] were actually singing about their own lives in West London was like a bolt out of the blue.|$|E
500|$|During {{the spring}} of 1964, Ray Davies played {{an early version of}} [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] on piano to rock {{photographer}} Allan Ballard during a photo shoot. Ballard later remembered, [...] "It was quite a small, pokey, Victorian Terrace, a bit scruffy, and in the hallway they had an upright piano. Ray sat down and plonked out, 'Der-der, der, Der-der!' He said, 'What do you reckon to this?' It <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> me at the time, but it ended up as 'You Really Got Me'." ...|$|E
5000|$|Traditional Islam {{emphasized}} man's {{relation with}} God and living by Sharia, {{but not the}} state [...] "which <b>meant</b> almost <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> them but trouble ... taxes, conscription, corvée labor." [...] Islamists and revivalists embrace the state, in statements like: Islam [...] "is rich with instructions for ruling a state, running an economy, establishing social links and relationships among the people and instructions for running a family," [...] and [...] "Islam is not precepts or worship, but a system of government." ...|$|R
6000|$|She had not in {{the least}} known what the words might convey,--had {{probably}} <b>meant</b> <b>nothing.</b> But <b>to</b> Augusta it was apparent that Ayala had declared that her lover, her Septimus, had preferred her extreme youth to the more mature charms of his own true love,--or had, perhaps, preferred Ayala's raillery to Augusta's serious demeanour. [...] "You are the most impertinent person I ever knew in my life," [...] said Augusta, rising from her chair and walking slowly out of the room. Ayala stared after her, not above half comprehending the cause of the anger.|$|R

500|$|Duane L. Weber was a World War II Army {{veteran who}} served time {{in at least}} six prisons from 1945 to 1968 for {{burglary}} and forgery. He was proposed as a suspect by his widow, based primarily on a deathbed confession: Three days before he died in 1995, Weber told his wife, [...] "I am Dan Cooper." [...] The name <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> her, she said; but months later, a friend told her of its significance in the hijacking. She went to her local library to research D.B. Cooper, found Max Gunther's book, and discovered notations in the margins in her husband's handwriting.|$|E
500|$|Stoddart {{graduated}} in 1980 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, first class, {{though he was}} demoralised by his peers' ignorance of art history: [...] "the name Raphael <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> them". He went on to read History of Art at the University of Glasgow. Afterwards, he worked for six [...] "difficult" [...] years in the studio of Ian Hamilton Finlay. Although Hamilton Finlay {{is considered one of}} the most important Scottish artists of the 20th century, Stoddart profoundly disagrees with his working methods: [...] "Finlay was the godfather of a problem that's rampant everywhere today. He called the people who made his work 'collaborators'. What we call them nowadays is 'fabricators'. They're talented people who are plastically capable, but they never meet their 'artist'. They're grateful, desperate and thwarted." ...|$|E
500|$|The Indians {{drove back}} and pinned down Reno's soldiers, but then spotted {{additional}} troops {{making their way}} along the hills {{to the east of}} the encampment. [...] This force was led by Custer himself, though that name would have <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> Wooden Leg and the other Cheyenne at the time. [...] Most of the Indians broke off their fight with Reno to engage Custer and his soldiers. [...] Wooden Leg went back through the camp in the river valley rather than directly uphill towards the soldiers. [...] While he was there, his father tried to dissuade him from further fighting on the grounds that he had already done enough, but Wooden Leg would not hear of it, and even persuaded others to rejoin the fight and take part in the total annihilation of Custer's command.|$|E
60|$|Goldsmith was keenly {{sensitive}} to attacks of the kind, and meeting Kenrick at the Chapter Coffee-house, {{called him to}} sharp account for taking such a liberty with his name, and calling his morals in question, merely {{on account of his}} being seen at a place of general resort and amusement. Kenrick shuffled and sneaked, protesting that he <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> derogatory <b>to</b> his private character. Goldsmith let him know, however, that he was aware of his having more than once indulged in attacks of this dastard kind, and intimated that another such outrage would be followed by personal chastisement.|$|R
2500|$|In September 1948, as a captain, Griffin {{received}} sudden {{orders to}} report to the Strategic Plans Division (OP-30) in the Department of the Navy as officer in charge of special projects. [...] "That <b>meant</b> practically <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> me when I heard this. It wasn't too long after I got back there that I got head over heels into the business of the so-called revolt of the admirals -- the B-36 affair. I found that the special projects {{had to do with the}} preparation of statements for the chief of naval operations on very critical points." ...|$|R
5000|$|The console used metal prong {{connectors}} {{which required}} screwing {{them to your}} TV. The prongs had become outdated at the time, with its last use being in the late 70s. This also required the consumer to use an older TV {{to be able to}} use the Video Art. Another flop was the non-existent background music. This <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> was there <b>to</b> listen to and keep the user occupied, aside from the games.|$|R
500|$|Farmers holding grain {{ingested}} it instead, {{since their}} own planting had been completed. Distribution was hurried and open, with grain being distributed {{free of charge}} or with payment in kind. Some farmers sold their own grain lest this new grain devalue what they had. This left them dependent on tainted grain for the winter. Many Iraqis were either unaware of the significant health risk posed, or chose to ignore the warnings. [...] Initially, farmers were to certify with a thumbprint or signature that they understood the grain was poison, but according to some sources, distributors {{did not ask for}} such an indication. Warnings on the sacks were in Spanish and English, not at all understood, or included the black-and-white skull and crossbones design, which <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> Iraqis. The long latent period may have granted farmers a false sense of security, when animals fed the grain appeared to be fine. The red dye washed off the grain; the mercury did not. Hence, washing may have given only the appearance of removing the poison.|$|E
500|$|In British Archaeology magazine, Aston was {{described}} as [...] "the Mortimer Wheeler of our times" [...] because, despite strong differences between their personalities, both had done much to bring archaeology to the British public. It went on to note that Aston reminded archaeologists that [...] "their job is to do archaeology, and if that was an archaeology that <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> ordinary people, {{there was no point}} in it – and government would be among the first to notice." [...] Two of Aston's colleagues from Bristol University, Stuart Prior and Mark Horton, commented that [...] "Mick brought archaeology into the living rooms of half the nation, and left a legacy that will shape the discipline for decades to come." [...] Writing for the website of Antiquity, Christopher Gerrard described him as [...] "perhaps the best known face in British archaeology", adding that [...] "in so many different areas of medieval archaeology his legacy will live on". Emma McFarnon described Aston as [...] "Somerset's premier archaeologist" [...] in her obituary on the This is Somerset website.|$|E
500|$|Louise's {{relationship}} with the two sisters closest to the Queen, Beatrice and Helena, was strained at best. Beatrice had married the tall and handsome Prince Henry of Battenberg in a love match in 1885, and they had four children. Louise, who had a jealous nature, had grown accustomed to treating Beatrice with pity {{on account of the}} Queen's constant need for her. Beatrice's biographer, Matthew Dennison, claims that in contrast to Beatrice, Louise remained strikingly good looking throughout her forties. Louise and her husband were no longer close, and rumours spread about Lorne's alleged homosexuality. Thus, Beatrice was enjoying a satisfying sexual {{relationship with}} her popular husband, which Louise was not. Louise may have considered Prince Henry a more appropriate husband for herself. Certainly, following Prince Henry's death in 1896, Louise wrote that: [...] "he [...] was almost the greatest friend I had—I, too, miss him more than I can say". In addition, Louise attempted to champion her late brother-in-law by announcing that she was his confidante and that Beatrice, a mere cipher, <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
5000|$|Helen {{is a woman}} too young, {{too smart}} and too messed up by her {{precocity}} to ever live a normal life. Zale drew her as a very intelligent buxom blond bombshell, casting her against the [...] "dumb blonde" [...] stereotype. Her looks, though, <b>meant</b> almost <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> her, and her femininity only occurred to her as an afterthought and was usually applied with more aggressiveness than any man had ever seen, mostly upon her boyfriend Spencer Green, a character that Zale introduced in a strip which he syndicated with the College Press in the early 1990s.|$|R
60|$|His face lifted to {{the stars}} as he implored their aid in a vast and {{dangerous}} enterprise. It <b>meant</b> all or <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> him. He was {{in the mood to}} risk all his life and plans that night if she had been with him. The strangeness of the city had exalted him to the mood where his timidity was gone.|$|R
60|$|As {{she said}} this, Medea smiled; but, {{for all her}} smiling face, she <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> less than <b>to</b> poison the poor {{innocent}} Theseus, before his father's eyes. And King Aegeus, like most other kings, thought any punishment mild enough for {{a person who was}} accused of plotting against his life. He therefore made little or no objection to Medea's scheme, {{and as soon as the}} poisonous wine was ready, gave orders that the young stranger should be admitted into his presence.|$|R
500|$|A {{new set of}} the {{interior}} of the TARDIS was also designed, which Moffat estimated was three times bigger than the previous set. Moffat did not decide to create the new interior specifically for the new Doctor, but the brief to the set designer was to create a design that would suit Smith's Doctor. Though he loved the old set, Moffat thought {{it was time for a}} new one to [...] "surprise people", and believed that the spirit of a new era was to change everything. Piers Wenger said that it took [...] "quite a long time to get the design right" [...] and they were careful not to make it too futuristic-looking, as [...] "futuristic" [...] <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> the Doctor. The set was designed by Edward Thomas. The previous TARDIS interior was shown at the beginning of [...] "The Eleventh Hour"; the Time Rotor on console had to be rebuilt due to the explosion special effects that were used in The End of Time. In [...] "The Eleventh Hour", the sonic screwdriver is destroyed, and a new version, featuring a green light and metal claws, was created. Smith liked to keep the prop with him at all times [...] "twirling it around and flicking it" [...] which resulted in him breaking four of them. The noise made by the screwdriver was added in post-production using a synthesizer. Moffat described the changes as starting with a [...] "clean slate" [...] which made sense after the previous cast and crew had left.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Courtneidge had a {{long run}} in Under the Counter, a comedy {{produced}} by Hulbert. Its theme was the black market in luxury goods and the heroine's shamelessness in manipulating it to her advantage. This struck a chord with British audiences after the privations of the war, and the play ran for two years. When Hulbert took the production to Broadway, the premise of the piece <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> New York audiences, and it ran for only three weeks. Hulbert and Courtneidge then took the play to Australia, where it fared better. The Australian Quarterly wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|Hawks at {{some point}} began to {{disapprove}} of the pair. He considered himself Bacall's protector and mentor, and Bogart was usurping that role. Married, and not usually drawn to his starlets, he too fell for Bacall, telling her she <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> Bogart and even threatening to send her to Monogram, the worst studio in Hollywood. Bogart calmed her down and then went after Hawks. Jack Warner settled the dispute and filming resumed. [...] Hawks said of Bacall: [...] "Bogie {{fell in love with}} the character she played, so she had to keep playing it the rest of her life." ...|$|E
60|$|The several {{letters that}} passed between them brought Clayton no nearer to a consummation of his hopes {{than he had}} been before, {{and so it was that}} he wrote {{directly}} to Professor Porter, and enlisted his services. The old man had always favored the match. He liked Clayton, and, being of an old southern family, he put rather an exaggerated value on the advantages of a title, which <b>meant</b> little or <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> his daughter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{it seems}} to me it will grow harder all the time," [...] said Leslie miserably. [...] "I've <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> look forward to. Morning will come after morning--and he will not come back--he will never come back. Oh, when I think that I will never see him again I feel as if a great brutal hand had twisted itself among my heartstrings, and was {{wrenching}} them. Once, long ago, I dreamed of love--and I thought it must be beautiful--and NOW--its like THIS. When he went away yesterday morning he was so cold and indifferent. He said 'Good-bye, Mrs. Moore' in the coldest tone in the world--as if we had not even been friends--as if I <b>meant</b> absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> him. I know I don't--I didn't want him to care--but he MIGHT have been a little kinder." ...|$|R
500|$|A [...] "super-Treaty cruiser" [...] type {{was also}} {{projected}} {{as part of}} Franco's naval expansion plans, with some designs proposed for the type calling for an armament of six [...] guns; alternatively, some have speculated that the Spanish desired to purchase the two triple [...] turrets that were available following {{the decision by the}} German Kriegsmarine to rebuild the damaged battleship [...] with twin [...] turrets. The war situation <b>meant</b> that <b>nothing</b> was <b>to</b> come of this project either.|$|R
2500|$|Craig, renowned as the [...] "Humm Baby" [...] {{because he}} often said it, managed the Giants from late 1985 to 1992. In his first five full {{seasons with the}} Giants, the team had winning records. The Giants won 83 games in 1986 and won the National League Western Division title in 1987, losing the 1987 National League Championship Series to the injury-ridden, overachieving St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. The one bright spot in that defeat was their {{slugging}} outfielder Jeffrey Leonard, who was named the series MVP in a losing effort. [...] In Leonard's own faltering words, the prize money ($50,000) <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> him, but only the win that eluded him and his team. [...] He would have given anything to be going up north to play the Minnesota Twins, and his former teammate outfielder Dan Gladden, traded to the Twins {{at the start of}} the season, in the 1987 World Series, who beat the Cardinals in seven games.|$|E
2500|$|Knowledge of the Maya {{writing system}} {{continued}} into the early colonial era and reportedly {{a few of the}} early Spanish priests who went to Yucatán learned it. However, as part of his campaign to eradicate pagan rites, Bishop Diego de Landa ordered the collection and destruction of written Maya works, and a sizable number of Maya codices were destroyed. Later, seeking to use their native language to convert the Maya to Christianity, he derived what he believed to be a Maya [...] "alphabet" [...] (the so-called de Landa alphabet). Although the Maya did not actually write alphabetically, nevertheless he recorded a glossary of Maya sounds and related symbols, which was long dismissed as nonsense but eventually became a key resource in deciphering the Maya script, though it has itself not been completely deciphered. The difficulty was that there was no simple correspondence between the two systems, and the names of the letters of the Spanish alphabet <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> Landa's Maya scribe, so Landa ended up asking the equivalent of write H: a-i-tee-cee-aitch [...] "aitch", and glossed a part of the result as [...] "H".|$|E
2500|$|Tokyo's Pan-Asian rhetoric where Manchukuo was a {{place where}} Manchus, Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and Mongols would all to come {{together}} to live harmoniously in Pan-Asian peace, prosperity and brotherhood <b>meant</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> Kishi or the other Japanese bureaucrats governing Manchukuo. Along the same lines, Kishi used very dehumanizing language to describe the Chinese such as a people good for being only [...] "robot slaves" [...] or as a people who should be nothing more than [...] "mechanical instruments of the Imperial Army, non-human automatons, absolutely obedient" [...] to their Japanese masters. One of Kishi's closest friends and business partners, the yakuza gangster Yoshio Kodama summed up his boss's thinking about the Chinese as: [...] "We Japanese are like pure water in a bucket; different from the Chinese who are like the filthy Yangtze river. But be careful. If even the smallest amount of shit gets into our bucket, we become totally polluted. Since all the toilets in China empty into the Yangtze, the Chinese are soiled forever. We, however, must maintain our purity". A recurring theme of Kishi's remarks was the Chinese were excrement, something dirty and disgusting, which he and other Japanese needed to maintain their [...] "purity" [...] from by avoiding as much as possible.|$|E
25|$|Anne of Brittany's second {{marriage}} making her Queen Consort of France {{continued into the}} 16th century; and she died in 1514. Queen Claude of France, reigned as duchess of Brittany from 1514, but under her husband king Francis {{was not able to}} maintain an independent government in the Duchy of Brittany. Claude's son Francis I was invested as duke of Brittany. But this act <b>meant</b> next <b>to</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> advance Breton independence. Some members of the House of Penthièvre were appointed as royal governors of Brittany by the French. Their failure to reassert their Ducal rights successfully hastened the merger of the Ducal crown into the Kingdom of France. At this time the title Duke of Brittany began to lose independent sovereign status and began to become only titular in character; the Breton region lost independence and became a province of France.|$|R
60|$|The breeze {{had dropped}} as the tide ebbed, and Red Rose plunged languidly across the shining swell. Faint mist {{obscured}} {{the horizon and}} the yachts engaged in the fifty-mile race had vanished, although Wyndham thought he had not long since distinguished a sail in the distance. He was curious about this because if he had seen canvas it was Deva's, and her skipper had probably seen Red Rose. The rest of the fleet was scattered about to the north. Wyndham had noted their positions carefully before the haze rolled up. He wanted to win and <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> leave <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> chance.|$|R
