40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{understand}} the tribological mechanisms that lead to the failure of the commutating system of a DC <b>motor.</b> <b>Brush</b> and commutator are the most stressed components of a DC motor because of their role in transferring the current from the power unit to the rotor. Interrupting one of these parts leads to an unusual current transition and mostly to a complete damage of the motor. Two DC motors were analyzed after continuously running in a laboratory environment under the same conditions. Failure of one of the motors was observed after 1200 h, while the other one completed the test (1500 h) without any interruption. The analysis included the characterization of the structure and the chemical composition of the surface of the commutator and the brush using different complementary surface analytical methods. It was found that the failure of the motor is related to a very rough and thick layer that was formed both on the commutator and the brush surface. On the brush surface this layer mostly consists of oxidized bulk material (oxidized graphite) with small changes in the mechanical properties. On the commutator however, a combination of oxide material from the bulk (Cu 2 O and CuO) and a significant amount of oxidized carbon coming from the brush surface was found to form a layer. Furthermore, spherical wear particles were found within the microstructure of this layer. These layers were not observed on the surface of the motor that did not fail...|$|E

50|$|When {{converting}} electricity into mechanical power, brushless motors {{are more}} efficient than <b>brushed</b> <b>motors.</b> This improvement {{is largely due to}} the frequency at which the electricity is switched determined by the position sensor feedback.

Acceptance test levels are set with margin expected flight/operations levels and qualification test levels are set above the expected operation levels to check for the survivability of DC <b>brush</b> <b>motor</b> in space. Performance testing is important to design and integration in a planned test process in which DC <b>brush</b> <b>motor</b> were tested under actual or simulated mission profile environments to disclose design deficiencies and to provide information on failure modes and mechanisms. Statistical models are helpful in this process. The Logistic Regression Model is the commonly used parametric statistical models {{and is one of}} the statistical techniques that are used for analyzing and predicting performance with binary outputs. The objective was to develop Logistic Regression Model and is designed to examine the categorization of dependent variables in the quantitative analysis for the performance of DC <b>brush</b> <b>motor.</b> The work carried out demonstrates the development of the Logistic Regression Model for performance prediction of the DC <b>brush</b> <b>motors</b> for deploying unfurlable antenna.
