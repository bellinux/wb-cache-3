Downtown units use Trek bicycles and Polaris EFI 500 UTVs for patrolling nearby trails and special events downtown. The motor unit utilizes Harley-Davidson Electra Glide motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{having an}} insect {{infestation}} was considered shameful, and pest control companies generally advertised that their exterminators would arrive in unmarked vehicles {{so as to}} ensure that neighbors would not realize that a residence had a pest problem. Big Blue Bug Solutions {{was one of the}} first companies (by some accounts the outright first) to <b>mark</b> all <b>of</b> its <b>vehicles</b> and attempt to remove the stigma from having a pest problem. Today, nearly all exterminators use marked (rather than unmarked) vehicles.|$|R

50|$|Unmarked {{vehicles}} are used primarily for sting operations or apprehending criminals without alerting {{them to their}} presence. Some police forces use unmarked or minimally marked cars for traffic law enforcement, since drivers slow down at the sight <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> police <b>vehicles</b> and unmarked vehicles {{make it easier for}} officers to catch speeders and traffic violators. This practice is controversial, with for example, New York State banning this practice in 1996 {{on the grounds that it}} endangered motorists who might be pulled over by people impersonating police officers.|$|R
50|$|Niagara Regional Police Service marked patrol {{vehicles}} {{have historically}} been white in colour. In the late 1980s - early 1990's, they were distinguished with royal blue hoods and a single blue stripe on the sides <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle.</b> In the mid 1990s, the Service adopted the crest used today, switching to blue and green stripes on the sides <b>of</b> patrol <b>vehicles,</b> and abandoning the traditional blue hoods. This striping change was relatively short lived, with the Service soon adopting red and blue striping more commonly seen on police vehicles in Ontario. In 2013, the Niagara Regional Police Service commenced a dramatic re-branding <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> patrol <b>vehicles,</b> adopting {{a black and white}} colour scheme, with silver and red graphics, which is being phased in as vehicles are replaced through attrition.|$|R

50|$|With {{hilly terrain}} and busy traffic {{conditions}} in Camp Hill, local recreational cycling opportunities are limited, aside from paved circuits on Lavarack Park and Perth Street Park. However, as at February 2016 several citywide cycle routes pass through Camp Hill. Old Cleveland Road is a radial route that includes formal bicycle lanes in neighbouring suburbs of Carina and Coorparoo, although not through Camp Hill. Stanley Road is a radial route that is line-marked as a Bicycle Awareness Zone (yellow stencil stylized bicycle <b>marked</b> on edge <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> travel lane). Oateson Skyline Drive - Wiles St is a circumferential route that includes formal bicycle lanes. The inner eastern suburbs bicycle route, also circumferential, includes bicycle lanes on Bennetts Road and then passes through back streets marked as Bicycle Awareness Zones between Old Cleveland Road at Ashton Street, and Chatsworth Road at Greens Road. Packs of cyclists are commonplace along Old Cleveland Road early on weekend mornings.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Skid <b>mark</b> and {{coefficient}} <b>of</b> friction {{are usually}} utilized {{to calculate the}} velocity and behavior <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> For a critical case such as traffic accident reconstruction, however, the initial velocity of the car should be calculated precisely. In this study, in order to estimate the speed at the brake onset, rapid braking tests were executed on the proving ground. We compared with a skid length and wheel locking time of an expert driver and a general person. We verified that the skid <b>mark</b> <b>of</b> expert driver occurs longer than general person's. A new method is proposed to determine the speed <b>of</b> a <b>vehicle</b> at the brake onset of maximum braking, which {{could be applied to}} a reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> with Non-ABS...|$|R

50|$|The suburb's terrain {{varies from}} {{flat on the}} Norman Creek {{floodplain}} in the suburb's south and west towards Coorparoo and East Brisbane, to hilly in the suburb's north towards Hawthorne and Morningside, and east towards Seven Hills and Camp Hill. Traffic conditions are busy along its major roads including Canara Street-Crown Street-Macrossan Avenue, Bennetts Road, and Wynnum Road. Recreational cycling opportunities are consequently limited on {{the north and east}} sides of the suburb. However, the presence of parkland between Norman Avenue and Norman Creek including the Norman Creek Cycleway provides for good opportunities on its south and west sides. As at February 2016 several citywide cycle routes pass through the suburb. This includes Wynnum Road, which has a shared pedestrian/bicycle path due to narrow traffic lanes, Canara Street-Crown Street-Macrossan Avenue, which is line-marked as a Bicycle Awareness Zone (yellow stencil stylized bicycle <b>marked</b> on edge <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> travel lane), and Bennetts Road, which has formal bicycle lanes south of Agnew Street.

50|$|As {{with the}} Honolulu Police Department, Hawaii County Police has a fleet <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> police cars {{as well as}} subsidized police cars, meaning they allow {{officers}} to use their personally owned vehicles as police cars.Department subsidized vehicles are made distinguishable as on duty police vehicles {{by the addition of}} a removable blue strobe beacon light strapped to the roof <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle.</b> This has prompted controversy within the local community as many residents and police officers would prefer to have dedicated and fully <b>marked</b> fleet <b>of</b> police <b>vehicles.</b> However, the County believes this would be a cost prohibitive expense to take on all at one time and believes it would be financially prudent to continue subsidizing the police officers with a stipend to pay for a police vehicle. Many police officers view this as an additional incentive or benefit of the job. In a recent effort to promote higher visibility, the department increased the stipend by an additional $50/month if the vehicle the officer uses in their daily police use is white in color. Police departments on the islands of Kauai & Maui who also at one time had a similar program for subsidizing police vehicles have mostly stopped using the subsidized program and their fleets are now fully marked. The Kauai Police Dept. does have a few subsidized <b>vehicles</b> as <b>of</b> 2014.|$|R
