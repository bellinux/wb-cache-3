25|$|In September 2011 Massow set up Pay <b>Me</b> <b>My,</b> {{a trading}} name of Massows Limited, which offered {{customers}} a rebate of 80% of the 'trail' commission paid to their existing advisers if the customer switched their insurance, pension and investment policies {{to the agency}} of Pay <b>Me</b> <b>My,</b> who would take 20% as their fee. Massow defended the business model of the firm from suggestions {{that it would not}} be viable following changes to financial regulation in the UK due to start on 1 January 2013; however, it ceased trading in August 2013 after it announced that its business model was loss making and could not be sustained. The firm informed its clients that, should they choose to remain with the company, all future trail commissions would be retained and not rebated. This action was unpopular with customers, therefore Massow agreed to sell the remaining assets under management to Clubfinance, who would continue rebating the majority of their commission.|$|E

25|$|After {{my return}} from Vietnam, the {{opportunity}} to serve became the motivating force in my life. Military service has given <b>me</b> <b>my</b> greatest challenges and my greatest rewards. I have worked hard for sound leadership development in the Army and for realistic training. The greatest problem faced by POWs was fear of the unknown. This fear can be reduced, {{not only for the}} potential POW but across the awesome environment of the battlefield, by training which is honest enough to address the real issue of combat and which is tough enough to approximate battlefield conditions.|$|E
25|$|I {{jumped into}} a seal hole, pushing the ice away as I entered, and they handed <b>me</b> <b>my</b> camera. Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around where my mouth {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet and I found myself looking at easily {{one of the most}} extraordinary scenes I had ever, ever experienced. When I dropped down {{through a hole in the}} ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E

25|$|Even before {{charges were}} filed, as rumours about rape accusations {{surfaced}} later in November, Zuma's political prospects {{began to appear}} to take {{a turn for the}} worse. Most of his higher-level political supporters could not respond to these new charges the way they had the corruption charges. In a hearing prior to the rape trial, a group of thousands of his supporters gathered near the courthouse, as a smaller gathering of anti-rape groups demonstrated on behalf of the alleged rape victim. As he did throughout the trial, Zuma sang Lethu Mshini Wami (Bring <b>me</b> <b>my</b> machine gun) with the crowd, and ANC Youth League and Communist Party Youth League spokesmen spoke in support of Zuma.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin <b>me.</b> <b>My</b> response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
