50|$|Boron {{has been}} used in BPSG, the {{insulator}} in the interconnection layers of integrated circuits, particularly in the lowest one. The inclusion of boron lowers the <b>melt</b> <b>temperature</b> of the glass providing better reflow and planarization characteristics. In this application the glass is formulated with a boron content of 4% to 5% by weight. Naturally occurring boron is 20% 10B with the remainder the 11B isotope. Soft errors are caused by the high level of 10B in this critical lower layer of some older integrated circuit processes. Boron-11, used at low concentrations as a p-type dopant, does not contribute to soft errors. Integrated circuit manufacturers eliminated borated dielectrics by the time individual circuit components decreased in size to 150 nm, largely due to this problem.|$|E
50|$|Hot melt glues usually {{consist of}} one base {{material}} with various additives. The composition is usually formulated {{to have a}} glass transition temperature (onset of brittleness) below the lowest service temperature and a suitably high <b>melt</b> <b>temperature</b> as well. The degree of crystallization should {{be as high as}} possible but within limits of allowed shrinkage. The melt viscosity and the crystallization rate (and corresponding open time) can be tailored for the application. Faster crystallization rate usually implies higher bond strength. To reach the properties of semicrystalline polymers, amorphous polymers would require molecular weights too high and, therefore, unreasonably high melt viscosity; the use of amorphous polymers in hot melt adhesives is usually only as modifiers. Some polymers can form hydrogen bonds between their chains, forming pseudo-cross-links which strengthen the polymer.|$|E
5000|$|Fused quartz or {{fused silica}} is glass {{consisting}} of silica in amorphous (non-crystalline) form.

Fused silica, therefore, has high working and melting temperatures. The optical and thermal properties of fused quartz are superior {{to those of other}} types of glass due to its purity. For these reasons, it finds use in situations such as semiconductor fabrication and laboratory equipment. It transmits ultraviolet better than other glasses, so is used to make lenses and optics for the ultraviolet spectrum. Its low coefficient of thermal expansion also makes it a useful material for precision mirror substrates.|$|E
30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in fusion welding of dissimilar joints as well as in solid-state welding processes is the <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> of the two base metals. A notable difference in the <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> of the base metals may result in rupture of the lower-melting-temperature metal (Hayes, et al., 2011). For instance, in a friction welded joint, Al melts more than Cu, due to the lower <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> of Al compared to Cu (Sahin, 2009). Moreover, the study of Bisadi, et al. (2013) on the friction-stir welding process shows that joints with a significant difference in base metal <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> welded with a high welding temperature have cavities in the transition zone of Al and Cu. Previous study showed that residual thermal stresses and misfit strains are produced in Al-Cu joints because of the significant difference in the <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> of Al and Cu (Mai & Spowage, 2004). Significant difference in <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> also affects the surface appearance of the joint. Lap laser welding with Al (topside) and Cu resulted in problems such as large weld bead formation and a large heat-affected zone on the Al side, due to the low <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> and the high absorptivity of the laser wavelength by Al (Weigl, et al., 2011; Sujin, et al., 2014). The above studies show that the difference in <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> has effects on defects and the surface appearance of Al-Cu joints and thus influences weld mechanical properties.|$|R
40|$|Solid fuels, {{including}} biomass, {{consist of}} combustible, ash and water. Ash in fuel is result of reaction of minerals {{presented in the}} biomass. Minerals and other different substances which form ash got into biomass during growth. Ash is solid residue resulted from the perfect laboratory combustion of fuel. It is composed of minerals that {{are present in the}} fuel. Some species of biomass ash have low ash <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> and can cause various problems in combustion boilers. Ash slags and sinters can avoid heat transfer in heat exchangers, which can cause corrosion of heat transfer surfaces. Ash <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> can be determined on the basis of standard STN ISO 540 in some laboratory. Meltability of ash is characterized by the physical state of the ash, which occurs during the heating process under well-defined conditions in furnace. There exist 4 types of ash <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> - Shrinkage temperature (ST), Deformation temperature (DT), Hemisphere temperature (HT) and Flow temperature (FT). Experimental determination of ash <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> is quite expensive. In paper is described method of prediction ash <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> from known chemical composition of biomass ash.

5000|$|Nominally {{anhydrous}} minerals (NAMs) are minerals {{with only}} trace to minor amounts of hydrous components. The hydrous material occurs only at crystal defects.

[...] Individual minerals may contain only a very low content of OH but their total weight can contribute significant as the H2O reservoir on Earth and other terrestrial planets.

50|$|Resistance {{soldering}} {{is unlike}} using a conduction iron, where heat is produced within an element and then {{passed through a}} thermally conductive tip into the joint area. A cold soldering iron requires time to reach working temperature and must be kept hot between solder joints. Thermal transfer may be inhibited if the tip is not kept properly wetted during use. With resistance soldering an intense heat can be rapidly developed directly within the joint area and in a tightly controlled manner. This allows a faster ramp up to the required solder <b>melt</b> <b>temperature</b> and minimizes thermal travel away from the solder joint, which helps to minimize the potential for thermal damage to materials or components in the surrounding area. Heat is only produced while each joint is being made, making resistance soldering more energy efficient. Resistance soldering equipment, unlike conduction irons, {{can be used for}} difficult soldering and brazing applications where significantly higher temperatures may be required. This makes resistance comparable to flame soldering in some situations. When the required temperature can be achieved by either flame or resistance methods the resistance heat is more localized because of direct contact, whereas the flame will spread thus heating a potentially larger area.|$|E
50|$|Tetra-primer {{amplification}} refractory mutation system PCR, or ARMS-PCR, employs {{two pairs}} of primers to amplify two alleles in one PCR reaction. The primers are designed such that the two primer pairs overlap at a SNP location but each match perfectly to {{only one of the}} possible SNPs. The basis of the invention is that unexpectedly, oligonucleotides with a mismatched 3'-residue will not function as primers in the PCR under appropriate conditions. As a result, if a given allele is present in the PCR reaction, the primer pair specific to that allele will produce product but not to the alternative allele with a different SNP. The two primer pairs are also designed such that their PCR products are of a significantly different length allowing for easily distinguishable bands by gel electrophoresis or <b>melt</b> <b>temperature</b> analysis. In examining the results, if a genomic sample is homozygous, then the PCR products that result will be from the primer that matches the SNP location and the outer opposite-strand primer, as well from the two outer primers. If the genomic sample is heterozygous, then products will result from the primer of each allele and their respective outer primer counterparts as well as the outer primers.|$|E
