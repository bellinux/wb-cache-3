Audio mixing was done by Keusch at Sony Music Studios in New York, New York. Christopher J. Warner provided the guitar present in the song's composition. It was released as a single on September 21, 2004, through Casablanca Records. [...] "Rumors" [...] is {{in the style of}} contemporary R. Lyrically, the song was written {{as a response to the}} paparazzi and media's backlash, both which are addressed in the chorus lines, where Lohan sings, [...] "I'm tired of rumors starting/ I'm sick of being followed/ I'm tired of people lying/ Saying what they want about me/ Why can't they back up off me?/ Why can't they let <b>me</b> <b>live?</b> I'm going to do it my way/ Take this for just what it is." [...] Spence D. of IGN noted that the singer's vocals are [...] "driven by snarls, breathy croons, and emotionally restrained angst," [...] while John Murphy of musicOMH considered it [...] "a feisty dance anthem with intelligent lyrics attacking the paparazzi and press in general." ...|$|E

2500|$|Islam, as {{with other}} Abrahamic religions, views suicide {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} sins and utterly detrimental to one's spiritual journey. The Islamic view is that life and death are given by God. Life is sacred, and a gift from God; and it is only God, and not the human beings, who has the right to take it back. Thus willful taking of one's own life is considered a major sin in Islam. Committing suicide to save oneself from suffering is discouraged. It is reported that a wounded Muslim soldier in the battlefield killed himself because of his suffering, upon which Muhammad (swt) commented that he would not be allowed into Paradise. Islam teaches that in the face of hardship, one should not directly pray for death. Instead, one should say: [...] "Oh Allah! Let <b>me</b> <b>live</b> as long as life is good for me, and let me die if death is good for me." [...] Euthanasia is considered one form of suicide and has the same ruling as that of suicide. Unjust killing of any human being is one of the most heinous and the cardinal sins in Islam.|$|E
2500|$|Dev's electro {{style and}} [...] "sing-talk" [...] vocal style have been {{compared}} to fellow pop singer Kesha. Dev responded to this, saying, [...] "I'm confident enough in what I do that people will see me for who I am ... I get why people compare us but once people see <b>me</b> <b>live</b> they won't connect us as much." [...] While comparing her to Kesha, Idolator wrote that [...] "Dev's beats come off a bit more mellow and her songs {{a little bit more}} electro than pop." [...] In response to being compared to both Kesha and Uffie, Dev said, [...] "I just feel that I have a lot more to say and the ability to have an eclectic sound, I'm not bashing either artist, but I'm {{going to be able to}} give you a little bit more than what you've heard on those records. When my album comes out, hopefully I won't have to hear another reference or comparison." [...] Much of Dev's music is inspired by rap music, as she believes that fans respond to [...] "pop music but with rap roots". She said, [...] "I've always been into hip-hop. Eminem changed my life when I was younger." [...] The Hollywood Reporter compared her [...] "futuristic" [...] and [...] "pulsing" [...] sound to underground electroclash musicians Peaches and Yelle. Dev's musical genres have been cited as electro-crunk and electropop.|$|E
