5000|$|For {{an optical}} fiber, the {{effective}} <b>mode</b> <b>volume</b> is {{the square of}} the product of the diameter of the near-field pattern and the sine of the radiation angle of the far-field pattern. The diameter of the near-field radiation pattern is defined here as the full width at half maximum and the radiation angle at half maximum radiant intensity. Effective <b>mode</b> <b>volume</b> is proportional to the breadth of the relative distribution of power amongst the modes in a multimode fiber. It is not truly a spatial volume but rather an [...] "optical volume" [...] equal to the product of area and solid angle. The power divided by the effective <b>mode</b> <b>volume</b> is proportional to the radiance of the light emitted by the fiber.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, {{semiconductor}} lasers have relentlessly followed the path towards miniaturization. Smaller lasers are more energy efficient, are cheaper to make, and open up new applications in sensing and displays, among many other things. Yet, up until recently, there was a fundamental problem with making lasers smaller: purely semiconductor lasers couldn't be made smaller than the diffraction limit of light. In recent years, however, metal-based lasers have been demonstrated in the nanoscale that have shattered the diffraction limit. As optical materials, metals {{can be used to}} either reflect light (metal-optics) or convert light to electrical currents (plasmonics). In both cases, metals have provided ways to squeeze light beyond the diffraction limit. In this dissertation, I experimentally demonstrated one nanolaser based on plasmonic transduction and another laser based on metal-optic reflection. To create coherent plasmons, I designed a nanolaser based on a plasmonic bandgap defect state inside a surface plasmonic crystal. In a one-dimensional periodic semiconductor beam, I was able to confine surface plasmons by interrupting the periodicity of the crystal. These confined surface plasmons then underwent laser oscillations in effective <b>mode</b> <b>volumes</b> as small as 0. 007 cubic wavelengths. At this electromagnetic volume, energy was squeezed 10 times smaller than those possible in similar photonic crystals that do not utilize metal. This demonstration should pave the way for achieving engineered nanolasers with deep-subwavelength <b>mode</b> <b>volumes</b> and enable plasmonic crystals to become attractive platforms for designing plasmons. After achieving large reductions in electromagnetic <b>mode</b> <b>volumes,</b> I switched to a metal-optics-based nanolaser design to further reduce the physical volumes of small light sources. The semiconductor nanopatch laser achieved laser oscillations with subwavelength-scale physical dimensions (0. 019 cubic wavelengths) and effective <b>mode</b> <b>volumes</b> (0. 0017 cubic wavelengths). The ultra-small laser volume is achieved with the presence of nanoscale metal patches which suppress electromagnetic radiation into free-space and convert a leaky cavity into a highly-confined subwavelength optical resonator. The nanopatch laser, with its world-record-breaking small physical volume, has exciting implications for data storage, biological sensing, on-chip optical communication, and beyond...|$|R

Based on experimental and theoretical investigation the engineering of the coupling between two microcavities with radius of curvature of 6 inline imagem is demonstrated.

By optimising {{the dimensions of}} a 3 D woodpile PC, wide photonic band gaps (PBG) are created. Optical cavities with resonances in the bandgap arise when point defects are introduced in the crystal. Three types of single defects are investigated in high refractive index contrast (Gallium Phosphide-Air) woodpile structures and Q-factors and <b>mode</b> <b>volumes</b> (V_eff) of the resonant cavity modes are calculated.

50|$|The mandrel {{diameter}} {{and number of}} turns are chosen to eliminate certain modes in a reproducible way. It is empirically observed that more than 5 full 360 degree wraps creates little additional loss, so 3 to 5 turns are commonly specified. The {{mandrel diameter}} affects how far into the <b>mode</b> <b>volume</b> the modal unbinding occurs. Experimentally, one plots the transmitted power from a wrapped fibre into which a uniform modal power distribution has been excited, {{as a function of}} mandrel diameter, maintaining a constant number of turns. This reveals step-like reductions in transmitted power as the diameter decreases, where each step is {{the point at which the}} mandrel is beginning to affect the next-lower mode group. For best measurement reproducibility, one would select a diameter that is not near such a transition, although this may not be possible if measurements must be performed over a range of wavelengths. Total <b>mode</b> <b>volume</b> in a fiber is a function of wavelength, so the mandrel diameter at which the mode group transitions occur will change with wavelength.|$|E
