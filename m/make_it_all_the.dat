25|$|On June 12, 1942, as {{district}} court judge Fee began presiding over the trial of Minoru Yasui, a native Oregonian of Japanese descent who was on trial for breaking curfew. The curfew had been imposed by the United States Army's General John L. DeWitt {{under the authority of}} President Franklin Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066 that began the Japanese American internment after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The curfew only applied to those of Japanese heritage, with Yasui being the first person to be arrested for violating the curfew. This case would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the United States Supreme Court. The decision to take this trial to the Supreme Court made national news.|$|E
25|$|The Knicks {{were able}} to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the NBA finals during the 1969-70 NBA playoffs thanks to the great play of both Walt Frazier and star {{teammate}} Willis Reed. However, in game 5, Reed got a horrific leg injury, making him unable to walk {{for the next few}} days. With Reed out, chances of the Knicks winning the championship were slim. However, Reed somehow returned to the series, playing the first two minutes of game seven and scores the first two points of the game. Reed was simply in too much pain to continue to play for the last 46 minutes of the game, meaning that it was up to Frazier to lead New York to the victory. Frazier scored 36 points, had 19 assists, 7 rebounds, and 6 steals that game. His astounding performance is arguably the greatest game in NBA playoff history, as it was the only reason why New York was able to defeat the Lakers and win the championship. ESPN {{is one of the many}} websites to call Frazier’s incredible game the greatest game 7 performance ever.|$|E
25|$|The Colts {{once again}} began the 1998–99 season with Bert Templeton behind the bench. Daniel Tkaczuk once again led his team {{on and off}} the ice, Michael Henrich and first-year player Denis Shvidki added some scoring punch. Midway through the season the Colts decided to make some moves and bring in players that would {{hopefully}} put them {{at the top of the}} league. In a trade with the Toronto St. Michael's Majors, the Colts' management brought in one of the league's top scorers in Sheldon Keefe, along with Mike Jefferson, and Ryan Barnes. After that, the Colts had a young group of players that could possibly <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the Memorial Cup finals. At the end of the year the Colts had a 49–12–6–1 record for 105 points, and possessed two of the top scorers in the league. After defeating the Kingston Frontenacs 4 games to 1 in the conference quarter-finals, the Colts lost in seven games to the fourth-place Oshawa Generals, who had finished the season twenty points behind the Colts. Barrie goalie Brian Finley won the OHL Goaltender of the Year award as well as the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award as playoff MVP, and high-scoring forward Sheldon Keefe won the Emms Family Award as rookie of the year.|$|E

He was also enticed by the offered salary, which was $1.10 per day, {{as opposed to the}} 50 cents he could have made through physical labour. Babcock was recruited in Sydenham, Ontario and joined the 146th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He was then sent to Valcartier, Quebec. There Babcock underwent a physical, where it was discovered that he was underage. He was designated status A-4: physically fit, but underage. At the time, the minimum age for combat was eighteen. Babcock was turned down, but managed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to Halifax by train before he was stopped by the company commander.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} Benioff {{said about}} Daenerys Targaryen's transformation during the series, [...] "I think Dany's been becoming a Targaryen {{ever since the}} beginning of Season 1". According to Weiss, [...] "She's not her father and she's not insane and she's not a sadist, but there's a Targaryen ruthlessness that comes with even the good Targaryens". Benioff concluded, [...] "If you're one of the lords of Westeros or one of her potential opponents in the wars to come and you get word of what happened here in Meereen, you have to be pretty nervous because this is an unprecedented threat. You've got a woman who has somehow formed an alliance where she has a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, she's got the mercenary army of the Second Sons, and she has three dragons who are now pretty close to full grown. So if she can <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way across the Narrow Sea and get to Westeros, who's going to stand in her way?" ...|$|E
500|$|Reactions to {{the merger}} were widespread. Amid {{descriptions}} of the team as a [...] "super-team" [...] from at least one analyst were [...] manager Bjarne Riis' claims that he simply looked forward to defeating them. Cervélo co-founder and former [...] manager Gerard Vroomen saw the merger on a strictly business level, with neither side having sufficient resources to field a team at the level they would like, while cooperatively they would. Trek had been bike supplier for both teams in 2011, and funneling money they would normally spend on two teams into one, coupled with an expected reduction in support from the electronics company RadioShack, would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> simpler for them to back a top-level team. The merger also drew criticism, as the two sides' initial press releases describing it {{did not make it}} seem that they were in agreement over their perception of the merger and the newly combined entity. The fact that neither ridership nor lower-level management nor ousted sponsors seemed to know about the move at all ahead of time also drew criticism.|$|E

500|$|Three days later, it was {{reported}} that Marvel was looking at Alan Taylor and Daniel Minahan as prospective directors to replace Jenkins, and were also in the midst of hiring a writer to rewrite Don Payne's script, with the shortlist of possible writers consisting of John Collee, Robert Rodat, and Roger Avary. At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, was chosen to direct the sequel. Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones as reasons for his hiring, saying [...] "With Alan's direction we got a few more layers of patina, of texture, of reality into our golden realm." [...] By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter Robert Rodat to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in London in the summer of 2012. Hemsworth later confirmed that filming was scheduled to begin in August. Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more Viking-influenced feel, elaborating [...] "I think the science fiction element to Thor… the danger is it falls a little bit into the world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the Norse mythology kind of grew from. Having that in Asgard is going to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more special and that's what Alan [...] wants to bring to it." [...] Feige said [...] "while the relationship between Loki and Thor certainly has changed [...] and has progressed, a lot of Thor 2 is picking up where it left off in terms of Jane, who you just saw for a moment on a computer monitor, and also what's been going on in the nine realms without the Asgardians being able to use the Bifrost." [...] Feige also said that while Loki has a part, [...] "there will be a different villain, another big villain".|$|E

2500|$|South Florida has a {{tropical}} climate, {{the only major}} metropolitan area in the 48 contiguous states that falls under that category. More specifically, it generally has {{a tropical}} monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification, Am). The South Florida [...] metropolis sees most of its rain in the summer (wet season) and is quite dry in winter (dry season). The wet season, which is hot and humid, lasts from May to October, when daily thunderstorms and passing weak tropical lows bring downpours during the late afternoon. The dry season often starts in late October and runs through late April. During {{the height of the}} dry season from February through April, south Florida is often very dry, and often brush fires and water restrictions are an issue.

[...] Her next release was Aaina co-starring Jackie Shroff, and was produced by Yash Chopra, the film was a big hit at the box office, solidifying Chawla's position as the leading lady of the 90's. The critics praised her performance in the film and wrote [...] "1993 was Juhi Chawla's year with such films as Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke in which she delivered an excellent comic performance, and Darr, for which many still remember her as that highly desired [...] "K-k-k-kiran". I actually like her more either in comedy or in roles of smart and sophisticated women, but this one definitely works.
