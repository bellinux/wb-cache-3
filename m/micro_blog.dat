This paper proposed an approach of mining hot topics from <b>micro</b> <b>blog</b> by detecting the key terms emerging in large numbers and clustering them. To extract subject headings, a compound weight was structured by considering the term frequency and the growth rate to measure the likelihood of a word to be a hot topic keyword; To construct the hot topic, contextual relevance model was used to support incremental clustering, which is more suitable to the problem compared with semantic similarity.

40|$|AbstractTwitter, {{an online}} <b>micro</b> <b>blogs,</b> enables its users {{to write and}} read text-based posts known as “tweets”. It {{became one of the}} most {{commonly}} used social networks. However, an important problem arises is that the returned tweets, when searching for a topic phrase, are only sorted by recency not relevancy. This makes the user to manually read through the tweets in order to understand what are primarily saying about the particular topic. Some strategies were developed for summarizing English <b>micro</b> <b>blogs</b> but Arabic <b>micro</b> <b>blogs</b> summarization is still an active research area. This paper presents a machine learning based solution for summarizing Arabic <b>micro</b> <b>blogging</b> posts and more specifically Egyptian dialect summarization. The goal is to produce short summary for Arabic tweets related to a specific topic in less time and effort. The proposed strategy is evaluated and the results are compared with that obtained by the well-known multi-document summarization algorithms including; SumBasic, TF-IDF, PageRank, MEAD, and human summaries...|$|R

This paper addresses processing and automatic categorization of <b>micro</b> <b>blogging</b> data; in particular Twitter data, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques together with Random Forest classifier. As processing of twitter messages is a challenging task, we propose an algorithm to automatically preprocess the twitter messages.

The aim of this qualitative study is to explore the relationship between the public and the private in social media {{on the internet}}, specifically with emphasis on the identities which are shaped in this relationship. The social media explored in this study is the <b>micro</b> <b>blog</b> Twitter. Data was collected from the pages of three public and private actors on Twitter, specifically with concern to their interaction with public and/or private actors. The data was analysed with support in sociological theories on modernity, identity, self-identity, socialisation and Erving Goffman's theories on everyday expression. The results show that expressions of public identities from public actors are interwoven with expressions of private identities in the interaction with private actors. One of the study's main findings is the individualisation of public actors on Twitter in the interaction with private actors. Sometimes, the authority is shifted from the public actors to the private actors, which support the theory of the individualisation of public actors on the <b>micro</b> <b>blog</b> Twitter...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Imbalanced {{training}} data always puzzles the supervised learning based emotion and sentiment classification. Several existing research showed that data sparseness and small disjuncts {{are the two}} major factors affecting the classification. Target to these two problems, this paper presents a word embedding based oversampling method. Firstly, a large-scale text corpus is used to train a continuous skip-gram model in order to form word embedding. A feature selection and linear combination algorithm is developed to construct text representation vector from word embedding. Based on this, the new minority class training samples are generated through calculating the mean vector of two text representation vectors {{in the same class}} until the training samples for each class are the same so that the classifiers can be trained on the fully balanced dataset. Evaluations on NLP&CC 2013 Chinese <b>micro</b> <b>blog</b> emotion classification (multi-label) and English Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset version 2. 0 (single label) show that the proposed oversampling approach improves the imbalanced emotion/sentiment classification in Chinese (sentence level) and English (document level) obviously.

By using these score matrices we can analyze that what are {{the opinion of the}} people regarding certain topic by applying clustering on tweets. For example if we are collecting topic regarding certain government policy. Then firstly we will collect the tweets of people that have tweeted regarding that topic and then we will cluster the similar tweets regarding that topic.
