By joining the House of Martok, Worf's status in the empire was restored (albeit the House of Mogh remains stricken). Worf's son, Alexander, was also assigned to the Rotarran after joining the Klingon Defense Force. Though Worf was initially estranged by his now adult son, and skeptical of his son's desire to serve the Empire, he eventually reconciled with him, and his son joined the House of Martok as well.

25|$|Considering Modernism {{inclined}} {{urban planning}} to treat buildings and developments as isolated, unrelated {{parts of the}} overall urban ecosystems created fragmented, isolated, and homogeneous urban landscapes (Goodchild, 1990). One of the greater problems with Modernist-style of planning was the disregard of resident or public opinion, which resulted in planning being forced upon the majority by a minority consisting of affluent professionals with little to no knowledge of real 'urban' problems characteristic of post-Second World War urban environments: slums, overcrowding, deteriorated infrastructure, pollution and disease, among others (Irving 1993). These were precisely the 'urban ills' Modernism was meant to 'solve', {{but more often than}} not, the types of 'comprehensive', 'one size fits all' approaches to planning <b>made</b> <b>things</b> <b>worse.,</b> and residents began to show interest in becoming involved in decisions which had once been solely entrusted to professionals of the built environment. Advocacy planning and participatory models of planning emerged in the 1960s to counter these traditional elitist and technocratic approaches to urban planning (Irving 1993; Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007). Furthermore, an assessment of the 'ills' of Modernism among planners during the 1960s, fuelled development of a participatory model that aimed to expand the range of participants in urban interventions (Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007, 21).|$|E

Heavy press attention followed, and McGovern revealed his daughter had battled her alcoholism for years and had {{been in and out}} of many treatment programs while having had one extended period of sobriety. He authored an account of her life, Terry: My Daughter's Life-and-Death Struggle with Alcoholism; published in 1996, it presented a harrowing, unsparing view of the depths to which she had descended, the torment that he and the rest of his family had experienced in trying unsuccessfully to help her, and his ongoing thoughts and guilt about whether the demands of his political career and the time he had spent away from the family had <b>made</b> <b>things</b> <b>worse</b> for her. The book was a modest best-seller, and with the proceeds, he founded the Teresa McGovern Center in Madison to help others suffering from the combination of alcoholism and mental health problems.

50|$|The Paraguayans took {{advantage}} {{of their ability to}} communicate over the radio in Guaraní, a language not spoken by the average Bolivian soldier. Paraguay had little trouble in transporting its army in large barges and gunboats on the Paraguay River to Puerto Casado, and from there directly to the front lines by railway, while the majority of Bolivian troops had to come from the western highlands, some 800 km away and with little or no logistic support. In fact, it took a Bolivian soldier about 14 days to traverse the distance, while a Paraguayan soldier only took about four. The heavy equipment used by Bolivia's army <b>made</b> <b>things</b> even <b>worse.</b> The poor water supply and the dry climate of the region played a key role during the conflict.

50|$|Things {{went well}} at first, {{but one of}} the four {{jettisonable}} Schmidding boosters failed to release and the Natter got out of control. At 500 m (1,600 ft) the cockpit canopy pulled off as Sieber intended to bail out. He was instructed by radio to keep trying to shake off the booster, but inside the clouds he lost orientation as he presumably did not rely on the automatic radio guiding system which was designed to lead Natters with inexperienced pilots to the heights in which allied bombers operated. The Natter probably turned on its back and flew horizontally rather than climb, thus accelerating which Sieber may have misinterpreted for a steep nose dive, pulling harder on the thrust rudder which <b>made</b> <b>things</b> even <b>worse.</b> Also, the brake parachute did not open due to the booster still being stuck. When the Natter left the clouds, Sieber likely noticed his situation and tried to bail out, but due to the high speed he managed only to get out with his left arm and leg before the violent impact.|$|R

2500|$|A church {{existed on}} the site before the Norman Conquest, dating {{from the time of}} St Carantoc in the 6thcentury. Domesday Book (1086) {{recorded}} Crantock as held by the Canons of St Carantoc's; they had already been in possession before 1066. The earliest features of the existing church are Norman. In 1224 the choir was reconstructed and a tower was added. A collegiate church was founded {{on the site}} by Bishop William Briwere of Exeter in the mid 13thcentury. This consisted of a Dean and nine prebendaries. [...] To this collegiate church were appropriated the parishes of Crantock and St Columb Minor; in 1283 Bishop Peter Quinel united the prebends to make a vicarage. [...] The vicar was assisted by a curate at St Columb Minor. [...] However the old arrangement was restored by Bishop Stapeldon in 1309 and thenceforward the dean alone had cure of souls of both parishes, while the prebendaries were probably non-resident. [...] In 1312 the Pope gave the deanery to a Frenchman; the cure of souls however was entrusted to a perpetual vicar while the Dean was absent. [...] The endowment of the college was inadequate from the beginning but the economic effect of the Black Death <b>made</b> <b>things</b> <b>worse.</b> Bishop Grandisson in 1351 reconstituted the college as a dean, nine canons and four vicars choral (there had formerly been seven). [...] Canons who were unwilling to reside could compound for non-residence by paying for the education of two clerks and two or three boys. In 1384 it was found that none of the canons was resident and that the dean was a pauper. In 1377 the church was seriously in need of repair; the canons had the transepts repaired but the parishioners were unable to repair the tower. A legacy of £20 was left by Bishop Brantyngham to this end in 1393 but not long afterwards the tower collapsed upon the nave so that it was ruined. Indulgences were sold in 1412 to raise funds and then a new tower was built at the west end. [...] In 1412 the tower collapsed and was rebuilt. A memorial brass in Tintagel Parish Church commemorates Joan (d. 1430s?), mother of John Kelly who was vicar of Tintagel 1407-1427 and afterwards dean of Crantock.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day began}} well, {{and the weather}} was {{pleasant}} and sunny. Steve Waugh immediately unleashed his pack of fast bowlers, who posed a formidable threat to the Indian pair of Sehwag and Chopra. But the two openers, handled them with ease and looked {{the part of a}} top order pair. Sehwag took advantage of an ordinary bowling spell by Andy Bichel, flicking and driving confidently. He could not, however, negotiate the full and swinging deliveries and was dropped off one such delivery by Nathan Bracken. But the speedster had his revenge as he scalped Sehwag for his first wicket in tests. Sehwag departed for a fast 45 from only 51 balls. The score stood at 61/1. Later, Rahul Dravid batting on one, was tricked by a Jason Gillespie delivery into poking at a delivery that swung and seamed away. This produced a fatal edge that Hayden gleefully accepted. Dravid departed for 1 and the score was 62/2. In the very same over, Sachin Tendulkar came out to bat. After batting out two uneventful balls, Gillespie let loose a quick one. Picking the line of the ball early as the ball seemed like missing the off-stump, Tendulkar shouldered arms and the ball went and thudded onto his pads. Umpire Steve Bucknor looked blank for some time and finally raised his finger. Bucknor had already had a history of bad umpiring earlier in this match, overriding straightforward appeals against the Australian batsmen in their first innings, and this decision <b>made</b> <b>things</b> <b>worse</b> for him. His decision did not go too well with Tendulkar's Australian fans. Some of them reportedly made remarks like: [...] ""Didn't he turn down two straightforward appeals against the Australian batsmen on the first day? Don't they call him a batsman's umpire?" [...] and some others said, [...] "Hey mate, we came to watch Tendulkar bat, not Bucknor wag his finger." [...] But Tendulkar took the decision with grace. Robert Craddock, writing in The Australian, commented that, [...] "World cricket does not need electronic help to sort out lbw decisions. It just needs better umpiring. Steve Bucknor shouldn't have needed a camera to give Sachin Tendulkar not out when he was struck high ... Bucknor, a delightful fellow, was a great umpire at his zenith but there have been signs in recent times he is slipping and there is a gap emerging between his still high reputation and his performance." [...] Rajan Bala also wrote in the Asian Age:"In an earlier birth Bucknor might have been one of those Roman emperors who ensured that the crowds at the Coliseum were kept in suspense before he gave the thumbs-down signal to end the life of a gladiator or a Christian." [...] In fact, so annoyed were the fans that during Ganguly's innings, when he was struck in the shoulder, they said aloud: [...] "Give him out now."

The Armenians of Tsarist Russia was in {{a promising}} situation with their immense impact on economic, cultural and political affairs of Transcaucasia until {{the last two decades}} of the 19 th century, which saw major changes as regards to their position in the Russian Empire. This thesis examines the dynamics of this difficult period for the Armenians by investigating the Tsarist policies, which produced a complex picture for the Russian Armenians. In addition, another important factor, the influence of the Russian revolutionary movement on the Armenian revolutionary groups on theoretical and organizational levels is explained. By 1880 ’s, the combination of these factors caused the emergence of an unfavourable Tsarist treatment of its Armenian subjects in line with the general Russification policy. In the specified period, Russian foreign policy interests about the Armenian Question <b>made</b> <b>things</b> even <b>worse</b> for the Russian Armenians. The study explores this downward trend, which was to be culminated in the Tsarist decision to confiscate the Armenian Church properties in 1903. The Armenian response to this, intermingled in the broader course of the 1905 Revolution, was an important dimension for the fates of not only the Russian Armenians but also the Ottoman Armenians.

More than 100 Jewish {{people were killed and}} thousands more were arrested during these attacks. This was also the start to organized Nazi attacks, and the mass incarceration of the Jews. There was no clear Instructions on how to execute the violence, so it caused the destroying of Jewish property and inhumane treatment of Jewish people. The rioters destroyed 267 synagogues throughout Germany, Austria, and Sudetenland. The firefighter were instructed to prevent the flames from spreading to nearby buildings, but not to put the fires out on the burning synagogues. There was also about 7,500 Jewish-owned establishments that were robbed and had their windows shattered. About 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and moved the prisons or concentration camps as well. What <b>made</b> <b>things</b> even <b>worse</b> {{is the fact that the}} German government placed full blame on the Jews for the destructions and imposed a fine of one billion Reichsmark on the Jewish community.
