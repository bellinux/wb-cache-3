500|$|Because of his {{aggressive}} style-of-play, Selwood {{has gathered}} {{a reputation as}} a [...] "head–over–the–ball specialist" [...] and for consistently putting himself in positions to break tackles and win free kicks. His ability to [...] "buckle his knees, (get) down and pull his arm up so that the tackler's arm goes up above the neck" [...] has been declared by former Hawthorn captain Shane Crawford as [...] "almost impossible to stop at times" [...] and is reflected in his regular standing among league leaders for total free kicks received. It has also led to opposition players noting specific techniques to tackling Selwood—Carlton’s Kade Simpson admitted it was important to [...] "get in low" [...] because [...] "he’s such a master at lifting the elbows, which tries to slip the tackle up around the neck ... there’s no doubt it’s a skill". Selwood has declared the technique as a [...] "benefit and an advantage I’m getting at the moment on someone else because I see a weakness in what they are doing ... the majority of the time they are doing 95 per cent of the tackle right. It’s just that five per cent where I can use <b>my</b> <b>upper</b> body strength, I can dip at the knees slightly". Former Brisbane Lions captain Michael Voss agrees, stating [...] "all he’s doing is keeping his feet, dropping his legs and he’s got a fantastic tenchique in rolling his shoulder ... Selwood shouldn’t be penalised because he’s stronger than the tackler. If I was playing today and I could develop that technique, I’d be looking at it".|$|E

However, a statement from Collins on the Genesis band website said, [...] "There isn't any drama regarding my 'disability' and playing drums. Somehow, during the last Genesis tour, I dislocated some vertebrae in <b>my</b> <b>upper</b> neck and that affected my hands. After a successful operation on my neck, my hands still can't function normally. Maybe in a year or so it will change, but for now it is impossible for me to play drums or piano.

[...] Then, on December 1, 2007, Donaire made the first defense of his IBF title against Luis Maldonado of Mexico by a technical knockout in the eighth round. Donaire said, [...] "I guess my validation was today but I didn't feel my best; I felt sluggish. I didn't have my legs. I don't know what the problem was.

He was quotes as saying [...] "As of right now I want to get through this offseason program and make sure everything is good," [...] he said. [...] "I want to get confident with my knees right now so, when training camp starts, I'm full throttle and there's no holding back whatsoever." [...] When asked about off-season conditioning, Lewis replied: [...] "I think I'm a lot stronger, especially in <b>my</b> <b>upper</b> body. My lower body feels stronger than it was prior to the injury. I'm excited to see what I can do now with a year of NFL lifting and training without banging on (the knee)."

Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.|$|R
30|$|When you {{intuitively}} {{and positively}} know something {{is the right}} thing to do, proceed, and then later, if necessary, ask for forgiveness.

40|$|A {{reliable}} geological timescale for the Neogene sedimentary {{deposits of}} the Romanian Carpathian foredeep {{did not exist}} so far {{due to the lack}} of accurate isotopic datings and straightforward magnetostratigraphic correlations. Here we present a new chronology for the Upper Miocene to Pliocene deposits of the westernmost part of the eastern Paratethys based on high-resolution magnetostratigraphic data from the Focşani basin. The thick and continuous river sections of Putna (2. 35 km) and Rîmnicu Sǎrat (7. 32 km) yield excellent magnetostratigraphic results and allow an unambiguous correlation to the polarity timescale for the interval between 7 and 2. 5 Ma. The new age control permits the calculation of accumulation rates for each polarity zone, which shows a significant increase at approximately 5. 8 - 6 <b>My.</b> The <b>Upper</b> Miocene to Pliocene sedimentary rocks of the Focşani basin display cyclic alternations of sandy units and finer intervals. The calculated values for the average duration of the observed sedimentary cycles are very close to the average duration of precession (21. 7 ky), which indicates that the sedimentary cycles from the eastern Carpathian foredeep deposits are astronomically forced. We show that the usage of the unambiguous time-control offered by magnetic polarity stratigraphy would give a more realistic picture of the processes that have taken place in this tectonically active region. © 2004 Elsevier B.
