5|$|After the {{garrison}} of Nevesinje had been relieved, Laxa directed his main effort towards the Gacko and Avtovac districts. Sensitive {{to the fact}} that the Italians had not respected the territorial borders of the NDH when they sent their column to Gacko, he considered it very important that Croatian military and political prestige be restored, otherwise the Italians <b>might</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> remain in the area rather than withdraw to their garrison near the Adriatic coast. He planned to follow this consolidation by clearing the border areas with Montenegro then clearing the hinterland of any remaining rebels. For this last task he intended to deploy a yet-to-be-formed special unit to be led by Lieutenant Colonel Josip Metzger. The task of re-asserting NDH authority in the Gacko and Avtovac districts was allocated to Prohaska's group, consisting of the 6th Battalion, one company of the 18th Battalion, two companies of the 17th Battalion, and the recently arrived 15th and 21st Battalions, which were to be sent to Nevesinje from Mostar. Prohaska was to act in concert with the 11th Battalion who were already in the vicinity of Plužine, just to the north of the Nevesinje–Gacko road. In preparation, the 15th Battalion was trucked to Nevesinje, and a company of the 17th Battalion conducted a coordinated attack with the 11th Battalion on rebel positions near Kifino Selo. This attack was defeated by the rebels, and a battalion commander was killed.|$|E

25|$|In some jurisdictions, vehicle owners {{may also}} pay extra for {{specialty}} plates. With these, the plate serial is {{chosen by the}} licensing agency—as with regular plates—but the owners select a plate design {{that is different from}} the normal license plate. For example, an alumnus or student of an area university might purchase a plate with the school's logo, or an outdoorsman <b>might</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> pay extra for a plate depicting a nature scene. A portion of the extra cost of these license plates often ends up as a donation for a related school or non-profit organization.|$|E
500|$|Police visited Hindley, {{then being}} held in Cookham Wood, Kent, {{a few days after}} she had {{received}} the letter, and although she refused to admit any involvement in the killings, she agreed to help by looking at photographs and maps to try to identify spots that she had visited with Brady. She showed particular interest in photographs of the area around Hollin Brown Knoll and Shiny Brook, but said {{that it was impossible to}} be sure of the locations without visiting the moor. The security considerations for such a visit were significant; there were threats made against her should she visit the moors, but Home Secretary Douglas Hurd agreed with Topping that it would be worth the risk. Writing in 1989, Topping said that he felt [...] "quite cynical" [...] about Hindley's motivation in helping the police. Although the letter from Winnie Johnson may have played a part, he believed that Hindley's real concern was that, knowing of Brady's [...] "precarious" [...] mental state, she was afraid that he <b>might</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> co-operate with the police, and wanted to make certain that she, and not Brady, was the one to gain whatever benefit there may have been in terms of public approval.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} written by Glen and Les Charles and {{directed}} by James Burrows. On December 15, 1986, Shelley Long decided to leave Cheers as the regular character Diane Chambers, even though she and Ted [...] " [...] done some really terrific work at Cheers", for her movie career and family, while Ted Danson signed a contract for the next season (19871988), which led producers, the Charles brothers and Burrows, to separate Sam and Diane. An idea to keep Sam in and write Diane out without risk of ruining the quality and losing viewers had been developed. Before Diane was written out by having her leave Boston for a writing career, some ideas were attempted and discarded, like Sam and Diane's child in the next season, as Sam {{would have been a}} single father, and another ideal man for Diane. Three endings were filmed, in part to attempt to keep the actual one a secret, and because it was possible that Long <b>might</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> stay: 1) Sam and Diane become married; 2) Diane accepts an offer to finish a novel; 3) not revealed by the producers. The alternate ending in which Sam and Diane get married aired on May 27, 1998 as part of a 90-minute Fox special produced by the Paley Center called Behind the Laughs: The Untold Stories of Television's Favorite Comedies: A Museum of Television and Radio Special.|$|E

He engaged in skirmishes in March and again in August, where his small force of thirty soldiers armed with rifles came close to defeat. [...] Joubert again had to intervene in November 1887, and in 1888 defeated a force of 80 slavers, but his forces were too small to prevent continued attacks. The constant fighting also worried some of the missionaries, notably Father François Coulbois, who were concerned that the slavers <b>might</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> attack the mission itself.|$|E
2500|$|The {{court was}} {{emphasizing}} {{that the law}} requires the IRS to use the judicial process to punish lack of compliance with an administrative summons; the summons is not self-enforcing.

In the Schulz case the court left {{open the possibility that}} the IRS <b>might</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> drop the investigation and never enforce the summonses, or that the plaintiff might voluntarily comply with the request.

2500|$|Minsky {{believed}} {{that there is no}} fundamental difference between humans and machines, and that humans are machines whose [...] "intelligence" [...] emerges from the interplay of the many unintelligent but semi-autonomous agents that comprise the brain. He has stated that [...] "somewhere down the line, some computers will become more intelligent than most people," [...] but that it's very hard to predict how fast progress will be. He has cautioned that an artificial superintelligence designed to solve an innocuous mathematical problem <b>might</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> assume control of Earth's resources to build supercomputers to help achieve its goal, but {{believed that}} such negative scenarios are [...] "hard to take seriously" [...] because he was confident AI would go through [...] "a lot of testing" [...] before being deployed.|$|E
2500|$|High-stakes testing {{creates more}} {{incentive}} for cheating. Because cheating {{on a single}} critical exam may be easier than either learning the required material or earning credit through attendance, diligence, or many smaller tests, more examinees that do not actually have the necessary knowledge or skills, but who are effective cheaters, may pass. Also, some people who would otherwise pass the test but are not confident enough of themselves <b>might</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> additionally secure the outcome by cheating, get caught and often face even worse consequences than just failing. [...] Additionally, if the test results are {{used to determine the}} teachers' pay or continued employment, or to evaluate the school, then school personnel may fraudulently alter student test papers to artificially inflate student performance.|$|E

2500|$|One {{critical}} issue addressed by Moreton in this pamphlet involves the night watch, a highly significant {{institution in the}} panorama of eighteenth-century London. As described by Moreton, the watchmen were [...] "decrepit, superannuated wretches, with {{one foot in the}} grave and the other ready to follow" [...] and therefore more suited to the Poor House than for patrolling of the streets: [...] "so little terror they carry with them, that hardly thieves make a mere jest of them". He even supposes that some of them, discouraged by their low social status, <b>might</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> make their fortunes by passing to the other side and enlarging the ranks of criminals. Along with many of his peers, Moreton believes that English society is completely at the mercy of a dramatic rise in numbers of street-robberies, burglaries, and house-breakings, crimes which are generating anxiety among all social classes in the capital. House-breaking especially seems to directly concerned the entire metropolis, including the more wealthy and fashionable parishes. Moreover, the latest changes of the urban surroundings have hardened the policing of the streets, especially with shops, taverns, coffee-houses, theatres, pleasure gardens, remaining open in the evening and such {{a large number of people}} moving around after dusk.|$|E

50|$|Years pass, and Sauron, who had renewed his <b>might,</b> <b>decides</b> <b>to</b> {{attack the}} new realms {{while they were}} still weak. His onslaught fails, however, and Elendil, his sons, and the Elven kings fight back. For many years the great {{coalition}} (The Last Alliance of Elves and Men, as it became known) besiege Mordor. At last the host breaks through into Sauron's fortress of Barad-dûr. Anárion died first before Sauron broke the siege and the mighty king of the Elves, Gil-galad challenges Sauron to a duel, and is slain in combat. Finally Elendil fights Sauron, and though he is mortally wounded he manages to overcome Sauron before he dies. Isildur, Elendil's son, approaches Sauron's body and cuts off his finger with the One Ring, breaking Sauron's power and causing his spirit to depart from his body. Sauron later returns as the Necromancer in The Hobbit, and returns later to Barad-dûr {{by the time of the}} Lord of the Rings.|$|R
