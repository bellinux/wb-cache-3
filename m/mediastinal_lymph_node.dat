Methods Thirty patients with NSCLC would accept operation (new group) and 30 cases followed up three years postoperative (history group) were chosen respectively. The serum VEGF-C level of new group was tested. The VEGF-C and LYVE- 1 expression in the <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were put in practice between two groups.

40|$|Background: Endoscopic {{ultrasound}} (EUS) -guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a {{minimally invasive}} alternative technique for mediastinal staging of non-small cell lung cancer. A metaanaly-sis {{was performed to}} estimate the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA for staging <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (N 2 /N 3 disease) in patients with lung cancer. Methods: Relevant studies were identified using Medline (1966 to November 2005), CINAHL, and citation indexing. Included studies used histology or adequate clinical follow-up (> 6 months) as the “gold standard, ” and provided sufficient data for calculating sensitivity and specificity. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves metaanalysis was performed to estimate the pooled sensitivity and specificity. Results: In 18 eligible studies, EUS-FNA identified 83 % of patients (95 % confidence interval [CI], 78 to 87 %) with positive <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (pooled sensitivity) and 97 % of patients (95 % CI, 96 to 98 %) with negative <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (pooled specificity).

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} whether <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection improves survival compared with <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> sampling in patients undergoing resection for N 0 or nonhilar N 1, T 1, or T 2 non–small cell lung cancer. MethodsPatients with non–small cell lung cancer underwent sampling of 2 R, 4 R, 7, and 10 R for right-sided tumors and 5, 6, 7, and 10 L for left-sided tumors. If all tumors were negative for malignancy, patients were randomized to no further lymph node sampling (<b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> sampling) or complete <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection. ResultsOf 1111 patients randomized, 1023 (<b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> sampling in 498, <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection in 525) were eligible and evaluable. There {{were no significant}} differences between the 2 groups in terms of demographics, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status, histology, cancer location, type or extent of resection, and pathologic stage. Occult N 2 disease was found in 21 patients in the <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection group. At a median follow-up of 6. 5 years, 435 patients (43 %) have died: <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> sampling in 217 (44 %) and <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection in 218 (42 %). The median survival is 8. 1 years for <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> sampling and 8. 5 years for <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection (P = . 25). The 5 -year disease-free survival was 69 % (95 % confidence interval, 64 – 74) in the <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> sampling group and 68 % (95 % confidence interval, 64 – 73) years in the <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection group (P = . 92).

The patient was a 70 -year-old man in whom a large type 2 advanced gastric cancer accompanied with para-aortic and <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis was diagnosed. We attempted combination therapy of Docetaxel, CDDP and TS- 1. After 2 courses of treatment, the primary lesion and regional and para-aortic lymph nodes were significantly reduced in size, suggesting that this therapy had induced a partial response (PR). However, the size of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> did not change.

40|$|ObjectiveLobectomy with {{systematic}} complete <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection {{is standard}} surgical treatment for localized non–small cell lung cancer. However, selective <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection based on lobe-specific metastases (selective dissection) {{has often been}} performed. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the validity of the selective lymph node dissection. MethodsFrom 1995 through 2003, 625 patients in our hospital had surgery for complete <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection and 147 for selective dissection. We evaluated whether selective dissection adversely affected overall survival. To minimize possible biases due to confounding by treatment indication, we performed a retrospective cohort analysis by applying a propensity score. The propensity score was calculated by logistic regression based on 15 factors available that were potentially associated with treatment indication. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to quartile, and comparison between selective dissection and complete <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection was made using propensity score quartile-stratified Cox proportional hazard models. ResultsComparison of baseline characteristics between patients having selective dissection and patients having complete <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection according to propensity score quartile supported comparability of the 2 groups. The 5 -year overall survival rates were 76. 0 % for selective dissection versus 71. 9 % for complete <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection. The 5 -year survival probabilities stratified by propensity score quartile consistently showed no marked difference.

Patients and MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients with renal cell carcinoma whose histologic specimens were evaluated at our institution from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2006. Using Kaplan–Meier estimates, we compared the survival of patients who underwent resection of asynchronous <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastases with that of patients with stage IV disease. ResultsDuring the 7 -year study period, of the 386 patients with renal cell carcinoma who were evaluated at our institution, 9 underwent resection of asynchronous <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastases. After primary tumor resection and before diagnosis of asynchronous <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastases, all patients completed chemotherapy, cytokine therapy, or tumor vaccination; 3 underwent radiotherapy. The median age at resection of mediastinal lymph nodes was 57. 7 years (range, 39. 7 – 81. 2). The median time from primary tumor resection to <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> resection was 2. 8 years (range, 0. 5 – 23. 3). In all, 4 patients underwent resection of metastases via thoracotomy and 5, via thoracoscopy. The median number of mediastinal lymph nodes pathologically evaluated was 7 (range, 2 – 28); the median number of positive mediastinal lymph nodes per patient was 1. 5 (range, 1 – 3). We found no surgical complications. The median survival after resection of metastases (3. 2 years) was significantly longer (P =. 021) than for other patients with stage IV disease at our institution (1. 1 years).
