40|$|Small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> {{in rural}} areas are of {{particular}} interest {{at this stage in}} the evolution of the European CAP. Serious consideration is being given to mechanisms that could transfer resources from the agricultural sector into a more diversified rural economy in order to safeguard the well-being of both the farming community and the wider rural population while still preserving the environmental assets which are such a valued feature of Europe’s rural areas. Small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> are potentially attractive as a focus for future rural development initiatives because: ● The concentration of initiatives within such settlements takes advantage of the economies of agglomeration while allowing the benefits of such initiatives to spread out from these sub-poles into the surrounding countryside; ● Small and <b>Medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> contain the concentration of both human and institutional capacity required for “bottom-up ” initiatives of which the LEADER approach to integrated rural development is a good example; ● Small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> often contain the administrative infrastructure required to manage rural development initiatives on behalf of regional, national or European authorities in a properly accountable and auditable manner; ● In regions where land is scarce and the population density high, small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> provide the right locations to foster beneficial rural development while preserving the environmental assets of the open countryside.

40|$|This {{analysis}} investigates <b>medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> in Poland, i. e. {{those with}} a population between 20 – 100 thousand, located up to 100 km away from the main city of the agglomeration. The aim {{of this article is}} to compare the level of socio-economic development of Polish towns depending on their location in relation to the main city in the largest agglomerations in 1998 and 2013. Three zones of distance from the main city of each agglomeration have been taken into consideration: a. the inner zone, reaching up to 25 km from the main city; b. the outer zone located at a distance of 25 to 50 km from the main city, and c. the peripheral zone, located at a distance of 50 to 100 km from the main city and including the medium-size towns located outside the agglomeration system. This analysis of the distribution of <b>medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> and their level of socio-economic development has shown various levels of changes which depend on the distance from the main city of the agglomeration. In 1998, the highest level of development of the <b>medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> was recorded in towns outside of these agglomeration systems, i. e. those located most remotely from the main city (peripheral zone). Most of the <b>medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> are situated at a distance of 50 – 100 km from Warszawa, Kraków, Łódź, Lublin, Gdańsk and have developed their own local, or even regional labour markets and some of them have even provided administrative functions in the past as voivodeship capitals. Only in the Poznań agglomeration, the level of development of <b>medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> was higher in the immediate surroundings of the main city (25 km). The <b>medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> in all zones of the distance from the main city in the Wrocław agglomeration represented a similar level of development. By 2013, the level of development of the <b>medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> in the peripheral zone in all investigated settlement systems had decreased, with a significant improvement in the level of development of the towns in the immediate surroundings of the main city. Such situation occurs especially in the conurbation of Gdańsk and the agglomerations of Warszawa, Kraków and Poznań. This shows that the largest cities of Poland are the main engines of economic development by stimulating their surroundings and their impact on the surrounding areas. Unfortunately, the towns located in the marginal zones of several agglomerations (the zone 25 – 50 km away from the main city) experience certain disadvantages, such as the process of “the backwash effect”. Furthermore, the lack of developmental impulses is observed in many <b>medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> at the distance of 50 - 100 km from the main city of the agglomeration...|$|R

25|$|When the State {{was created}} in 1948 the {{overwhelming}} majority of the population was concentrated in a narrow coastal strip. One of the main tasks of the newly established Government Planning Department, headed by Sharon and directly responsible to the Prime Minister’s Office under David Ben-Gurion, was to find solutions for the great waves of immigrants who entered Israel after the declaration of Independence. The team consisted of 180 urban planners, architects, engineers and economists. They set up a National Outline Plan, dividing the country into planning regions in accordance with economic resources, geographic features, communication factors and historical background. The regional structure would be completed by the development of a regional urban center – a <b>medium-sized</b> <b>town.</b> Thus the plan provided for the establishment of 20 new towns, dispersed all over the country and established guidelines for industrial estates to be located close to the new towns. Sharon's plan led to the creation of development towns for example: Beit She'an, Kiryat Gat, and Upper Nazareth. Agricultural regions were planned expanding into the southern Negev desert. A national water plan was set up that would carry water from the surplus areas in the north to the dry, water-poor areas in the south. And a network of National Parks was devised, spreading all over the country, exploiting the existing landscape features, nature reserves and historical sites. At the end of 1953, Sharon was invited by the United Nations to serve as a planning expert in a Seminar on Housing and Community Improvement, held in New Delhi, and afterwards to Burma and Japan.|$|E

The ESDP 8 C European Spatial Development Perspective, a document published in May 1999 by the European Commission regarding the ballanced and sustainable development of the European Union territory stresses the role of small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> in the spatial orientation policies.

It also refers the strengthening of partnerships between urban and rural areas 11 as a means of overcoming the outdated dualism between city and countryside. One of the policy options of this polycentric spatial development towards a new urban-rural relashionship mentioned in point 3. 2. 3 (Indigenous Development, diverse and Productive Rural Areas) make it clear the important role small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>towns</b> are expected to play as focal points for regional development and promotion of their networking.
