40|$|In Africa, {{plantain}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important starchy food and cash crops. Nonetheless, one of the major constraints for its production was the unavailability of healthy planting materials at planting time. This constraint could be lifted using the cloning of planting materials via the in vitro micropropagation or in vivo <b>macropropagation</b> techniques. Shelled corms from four cultivars, known as PITA 3, FHIA 21, ORISHELE and CORNE 1, were used. Three treatments differing in three hormonal concentrations, especially 20. 0, 30. 0 and 40. 0 mg L- 1 were tested. The control one was hormone free. Tested treatments were laid out in a split plot design. The decorticated banana corms were sprayed twofold at 2 weeks interval with BAP solution when placed in sterilized soil in high humidity plastic tunnel. It emerged from results, regarding BAP concentration effect, that BAP treatment with 40 mg L- 1 significantly reduced the emergence time of shoots at 20 days as against 25. 1, 28. 3 and 28. 5 for the 2 tested other treatments as well as control, respectively. Likewise, the concentrations 40. 0 mg L- 1 both recorded the largest number of sprouted buds per corm and number of shoots per corm. With respect to banana cultivar effect, PITA 3 showed the largest number of shoots per corm. Basing on such findings, it is concluded that MSD technique combined with BAP at 40. 0 mg L- 1 is a suitable technique for improving of the in vivo <b>macropropagation</b> of plantain. This concentration increased at least 50 % of sucker production compared to control...|$|E

40|$|Vegetative {{propagation}} {{techniques are}} increasingly being applied to the domestication of tropical tree species {{as a means of}} producing planting stock and capturing genetic variation. However, the level of knowledge of cost-effective for vegetative propagation is not common and has slowed down domestication many of tree species. The current scenario of rapid climate changes and increasing land degradation in many tropical countries, certain multi-purpose tree species are becoming rare and threatened with local extinction. Thus, knowledge and efforts to develop low-cost vegetative propagation technologies to the people are necessary. In this study viable alternatives and potential factors to simplify various operations and reduce the costs in vegetative propagation for both micropropagation and <b>macropropagation</b> are reviewed.

40|$|Lack or {{shortage}} of healthy and improved planting material {{is a major}} constraint {{to the expansion of}} banana and plantain production. The situation is made worse by the lack of formal systems for producing and distributing quality planting material, thereby forcing farmers to depend on natural regeneration of plants for their supply. This is usually a very slow process, and produces small amounts of planting material that are likely to be contaminated with soil-borne pathogens such as nematodes. To overcome this constraint, several techniques have been developed to rapidly multiply banana and plantain planting material, including micropropagation under aseptic conditions in the laboratory. While micropropagation techniques can provide large amounts of planting material, they are not adapted to the conditions of smallholder farmers. Therefore, user~friendly techniques that require little technical skill or equipment would prove more attractive to adoption by such farmers. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (UTA) has been looking at alternative means of producing planting material for wide~scale distribution of improved banana and plantain cultivars. The alternative methods are classified into two categories: field techniques based on complete or partial decapitation of suckers; and the <b>macropropagation</b> of suckers practised away from the field. Treatment of suckers to reduce the risks of transmitting soil-borne contaminants is strongly recommended and forms an integral component of the dissemination package for smallholder farmers. <b>Macropropagation</b> techniques, although genotype dependent, can produce 8 - 15 new plants/corm within 15 days, while secondary scarification of newly emerging buds has the potential to further increase the number of plantlets by a factor of 2 - 3, within the same time frame. Plantlets obtained through this method have the uniformity of micropropagated seedlings while being less prone to post-establishment factors in the field. This method is simple and cheap, although it requires some minimum investment to set up propagators and weaning facilities, so it is suitable for small- and medium-scale enterprises. However, its utilization is undermined by several factors, the most critical of which are lack of initial capital investment and technical skills. Peer Revie...|$|E

30|$|From the {{presented}} knowledge, “culm cuttings” {{could be}} the best regeneration option to meet the global need for bamboo planting stock. Rooting and sprouting, as well as survival of cuttings, depend strongly on the season, species and plant growth regulators used. To maximise the success rate, in the absence of prior knowledge of the propagation characteristics of a species, we suggest the following approach. Use culms with one to two nodes from the middle of mother stock plants that are 2 - to 3 -years old, and set horizontally in appropriate substrate, preferably sand, during summer and maintain proper humidity (80 – 90 %). Irrespective of age of plant, or growth regulator concentration, the best response was recorded in summer with winter being the worst. The available data are inadequate for deciding the best doses and duration of plant growth regulators (auxins) which again depend on season. So, doses and duration of auxins need to be standardised for different seasons and species. The interactions of species, auxins and seasons still need to be studied. Further research is also required on the selection of better growth-promoting substrates, to improve the potential of the culm-cutting method. It is worth mentioning that addition of biofertilizers like nitrogen fixers Azospirillum sp. or Phosphorous solubilising bacteria (PSB) to the growth medium was effective for <b>macropropagation</b> of banana (Sajith et al. 2014) and pomegranate (Damar et al. 2014) respectively. Addition of compost was also found effective for propagation of another woody plant, Litchichinensis (Kumar et al. 2014). To date, growth media were restricted to sand only in bamboo <b>macropropagation.</b> Others, like soil, biofertilisers, vermicompost, compost, vermiculite, and their possible combinations, are yet to be explored for improving rooting and survival rates of bamboo propagules. The cut ends of the cuttings are the entry sites of the pathogens causing several diseases. Research is needed for effective control of those infections which decrease the success rate in cutting-based propagation. Successful propagation under different agroclimatic zones is essential for wider acceptably. To date, no multi-locational trial of any cutting-based method has been reported. The immense potential of the cutting method must meet the demand, if a few more factors are addressed properly through future research.|$|E

30|$|The type of {{substrate}} (rooting medium) used in propagation {{beds for}} the establishment of the macropropagules is also important. This medium supports the plant pieces by fixing the cuttings in a particular position. Different types of rooting media: viz. fine sand (Gulabrao et al. 2012) for eight bamboo species; sand for D. asper (Singh et al. 2004) and Bambusa balcooa (Joshi et al. 2012); and loamy material (Stapleton 1985) for B. nutans, Dendrocalamus hamiltonii and D. hookeri, have been used for <b>macropropagation</b> of bamboo. Mixtures of coarse sand and gravel were reported in Bambusa nutans by Islam et al. (2011), sand to soil (1 : 1) for Araundinaria alpine and B. vulgaris by Senyanzobe et al. (2013). Several other substrates, namely different ratios of soil, sand and farmyard manure (FYM) for B. vulgaris (Razvi et al. 2011); soil for B. vulgaris (Bhol and Parida 2015), coarse sand mixed with fine gravel for B. vulgaris (Hossain et al. 2006); and coarse sand, soil, and sand plus soil and vermiculite for B. balcooa (Gaintait et al. 2016; Ray and Ali 2016) have also been reported to improve rooting in terms of increasing root number and root length. Sand has multiple advantages: it is inexpensive, having good drainage and aeration because of higher porosity enables oxygen to reach the developing rooting system, and maintains a relatively uniform temperature (Allaire et al. 2004; Baiyeri 2005; Shah et al. 2006; Amri 2010).|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: Dennettia tripetala Baker f. {{is a small}} fruit-producing tree, {{which both}} animals and humans depend upon for their survival. Consequently, {{there is a great}} {{pressure}} on the seed, which is the only alternative for its inexpensive propagation. Hence, the species has been rendered threatened in the forest. Based on this fact, this study examined the <b>macropropagation</b> of Dennettia tripetala in order to domesticate and ensure its continuous availability for human utilization. Materials and Methods: The propagules (cuttings) used for this study were collected on five year old mother trees in Oloruntele, Ondo State while the experiment was conducted at the Department of Forest Resources Management, University of Ibadan, Nigeria. Cuttings were prepared using two factors; indole butyric acid (IBA) concentrations (0 ppm, 1000 ppm, 2000 ppm and 3000 ppm) and nodal positions (upper, middle and base), set under a high humidity propagator and watered twice a day. The experimental design used was a completely randomized design and the replication was done twice. Data were collected on percentage rooting, number of root per cutting, ramets’ height growth, ramets’ collar diameter and ramets’ leaf number. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA. Results and Conclusions: The optimum rooting was observed in 2000 ppm IBA treated cuttings (95. 50 %) and upper nodal cuttings (72. 39 %). ANOVA test shows that hormone concentrations and nodal positions significantly affected the rooting of D. tripetala. The study also showed that hormone concentrations and nodal positions do not significantly (p > 0. 05) determine the ramet’s height growth of the species, being that the ramet that had the highest height was 0 ppm (6. 11 cm) and middle nodal position (5. 96 cm). From the findings, 2000 ppm IBA hormone and upper node have been discovered to be the ideal hormone concentration and nodal position at which five year old D. tripetala cuttings can be best rooted and survive...|$|E
