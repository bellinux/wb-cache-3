5|$|As {{there were}} no local stakes in Canada at the time, Monson was {{responsible}} for both the <b>missionaries</b> <b>and</b> all LDS Church operations in the area. When he became mission president, he oversaw 130 <b>missionaries</b> <b>and</b> 55 church branches divided into 9 districts. During his tenure, the number of missionaries peaked at 180. Historically, most districts and branches in the area had been presided over by full-time missionaries, but Monson placed local members as presidents of branches and districts soon after arriving.|$|E

5|$|Several {{villages of}} Christian Delawares lay between the combatants on the Sandusky River and the Americans at Fort Pitt. The villages were {{administered}} by the Moravian missionaries David Zeisberger and John Heckewelder. Although pacifists, the missionaries favored the American cause and kept American officials at Fort Pitt informed about hostile British and Indian activity. In September 1781, to prevent further communication between the <b>missionaries</b> <b>and</b> the American military, hostile Wyandots and Delawares from Sandusky forcibly removed the <b>missionaries</b> <b>and</b> their converts to a new village (Captive Town) on the Sandusky River.|$|E

5|$|Little {{thought was}} given to the Chinese {{reaction}} to the Open Door note; the Chinese minister in Washington, Wu Ting-fang, did not learn of it until he read of it in the newspapers. Among those in China who opposed Western influence there was a movement in Shantung Province, in the north, that became known as the Fists of Righteous Harmony, or Boxers, after the martial arts they practiced. The Boxers were especially angered by <b>missionaries</b> <b>and</b> their converts. As late as June 1900, Rockhill dismissed the Boxers, contending that they would soon disband. By the middle of that month, the Boxers, joined by imperial troops, had cut the railroad between Peking and the coast, killed many <b>missionaries</b> <b>and</b> converts, and besieged the foreign legations. Hay faced a precarious situation; how to rescue the Americans trapped in Peking, and how to avoid giving the other powers an excuse to partition China, in an election year when there was already Democrat opposition to what they deemed American imperialism.|$|E

Some of the other languages spoken are Baya (Gbaya), Banda, Ngbaka, Sara, Mbum, Kare, and Mandjia. Sango was simplified by Christian <b>missionaries</b> <b>and</b> is widely used to this day.|$|E
5|$|As {{the statue}} became {{an object of}} a pagan veneration, <b>missionaries</b> <b>and</b> the Bishop of Vannes Charles de Rosmadec asked Claude de Lannion, Lord of Blavet Quinipily, to destroy the statue. In 1661, Lannion ordered the statue to be thrown into the Blavet river. Abundant rain {{destroyed}} the harvest soon after, which peasantry and devotees interpreted {{as an act of}} anger by their insulted idol. In 1664, the statue was drawn from the river and restored to its original location.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{attitudes in}} Western {{medicine}} in the 1940s and 1950s, Native American and Fijian cultures and societies were strongly dissuaded from premastication due to concerns about the hygiene of the practice. However, the lack of knowledge regarding premastication and its prohibition by <b>missionaries</b> <b>and</b> doctors instead caused severe anemia in the infants of the population, or resulted in malnourished infants and children deprived of nourishment.|$|E

5|$|His {{governance}} greatly stabilized {{and helped}} develop the southern third of Vietnam, {{turning it into a}} wealthy and peaceful region. In addition, Duyệt opposed Emperor Minh Mạng's ascension and defended Christian <b>missionaries</b> <b>and</b> converts from the emperor's isolationist and Confucian policies. These attitudes brought Duyệt into conflict with Minh Mạng and led to the posthumous desecration of Duyệt's tomb, which provoked his adopted son Lê Văn Khôi to revolt against the court. Later, Emperor Thiệu Trị, the successor of Minh Mạng, rehabilitated Duyệt and restored his tomb.|$|E
5|$|The War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) {{caused a}} {{shortage}} of <b>missionaries</b> <b>and</b> instability in the reductions, so no new missions were built during this period. By 1718 San Rafael was {{the largest of the}} Chiquitos missions, and with 2,615 inhabitants could not sustain a growing population. In 1721 the Jesuits Fr. Felipe Suárez and Fr. Francisco Hervás established a split-off of the San Rafael mission, the mission of San Miguel de Velasco. To the south, San Ignacio de Zamucos was founded in 1724 but abandoned in 1745; today nothing remains of the mission.|$|E
5|$|The first horses on the American {{mainland}} {{since the}} end of the Ice Age arrived with the Spanish Conquistadors. Hernán Cortés brought 16 horses of Andalusian, Barb, and Arabian ancestry to Mexico in 1519. Others followed, such as Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, who brought 250 horses of similar breeding to America in 1540. More horses followed with each new arrival of Conquistadors, <b>missionaries,</b> <b>and</b> settlers. Many horses escaped or were stolen, becoming the foundation stock of the American Mustang.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, the War of the Quadruple Alliance broke out, aligning Spain against France, England, the Dutch Republic, and Austria. The war {{was fought}} primarily over Italy, but England and France used {{the war as}} an excuse to attempt to take over Spanish interests in North America. In June 1719, 7Frenchmen from Natchitoches took control of Mission San Miguel de los Adaes from its sole defender, who did not know that the countries were at war. The French soldiers explained that 100 additional soldiers were coming, and the Spanish colonists, <b>missionaries,</b> <b>and</b> remaining soldiers abandoned the area and fled to San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|The task of {{incorporating}} eastern Honduras into the Spanish Empire {{fell to the}} evangelising efforts of Spanish missionary orders. The earliest Franciscan missionaries, {{at the beginning of}} the 17th century, attempted to convert the natives in their own settlements. It soon became obvious that this was impractical, given the paucity of available <b>missionaries,</b> <b>and</b> the wide dispersal of Indian villages and towns. The friars changed their tactics, and gathered the natives in mission towns, known as reducciones.|$|E

5|$|A {{tradition}} of indigenous literacy in Ottawa {{arose in the}} 19th century, as speakers of Ottawa on Manitoulin Island became literate in their own language. Manitoulin Island Ottawas who were Catholic learned to write from French Catholic missionaries using a French-influenced orthography, while Methodist and Anglican converts used English-based orthographies. Documents written in Ottawa by Ottawa speakers on Manitoulin Island between 1823 and 1910 include official letters and petitions, personal documents, official Indian band regulations, an official proclamation, and census statements prepared by individuals. Ottawa speakers from Manitoulin Island contributed articles to Anishinabe Enamiad ("the Praying Indian"), an Ojibwe newspaper started by Franciscan <b>missionaries</b> <b>and</b> published in Harbor Springs, Michigan between 1896 and 1902.|$|E
5|$|After 1935, {{the mines}} were reopened {{and there was}} steady growth in the region. According to David M. Gordon, the unrest gave missionaries {{a chance to respond}} to the Watchtower {{movement}} in a coordinated fashion. The London Missionary Society and the Church of Scotland worked together after the strike, saying that the lack of education and religious instruction were contributing factors. The <b>missionaries</b> <b>and</b> the mining companies said that a Christian education would create a disciplined workforce, a belief which was called the spiritual wing of industrial capitalism. The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such as the Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United Church of Zambia in 1965).|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi under King Kamehameha IV declared its neutrality on August 26, 1861. Many Native Hawaiians and Hawaiʻi-born Americans (mainly descendants of American missionaries) abroad and in the islands volunteered and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the Union and the Confederacy. Native Hawaiians participating in the American wars during its period of independence was not unheard of. Individual Native Hawaiians had served in the United States Navy and Army since the War of 1812, and even more served during the American Civil War. Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaiʻi's ties to New England through its <b>missionaries</b> <b>and</b> the whaling industries, and the ideological opposition of many to the institution of slavery.|$|E
