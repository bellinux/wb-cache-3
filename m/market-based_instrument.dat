The underlying hypothesis is that a <b>market-based</b> <b>instrument</b> like the CDM might not be suited to achieving a balanced distribution of projects, and that additional measures may have to be considered to achieve a balanced clean development in every part of the world. In a first step, we look at the current situation of the CDM with regard to the distribution of projects. We then make an attempt to assess Africa’s CDM potential and correlate it with the numbers of inhabitants and the region’s level of CO 2 emissions. In the next chapter, we sum up the different barriers to an equitable distribution of CDM projects.

40|$|Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act {{instituted a}} {{nationwide}} system of tradeable pollution permits for sulfur dioxide emitted by electric power plants. This paper asks: What were the cost savings from using a <b>market-based</b> <b>instrument,</b> {{rather than a}} more conventional prescriptive approach? Using an econometric model of the decision {{whether or not to}} install a scrubber under different policy regimes, I simulate the decisions that would have been made under prescriptive regulation. I find that under an uniform emissions-rate standard chosen to achieve the same aggregate abatement as actually occurred, the total number of scrubbers would have been about one-third higher than under the baseline cap-and-trade program. The change in the distribution of scrubbers among units is more striking. Under prescriptive regulation, installed scrubbers would have had systematically higher scrubbing costs than they actually did, and would have been installed at plants with significantly higher costs of switching to low-sulfur coal (the principal alternative to scrubbing). At the aggregate level, these effects translate into aggregate costs of compliance that would have been greater than actual costs by an estimated $ 150 million to $ 270 million per year. Thus the use of the <b>market-based</b> <b>instrument</b> resulted in cost savings of between 16 % and 25 %. The results provide a concrete demonstration of the influence of policy design on both unit-level choices of abatement technique and aggregate abatement costs. market-based instruments, prescriptive regulation, environmental policy, pollution control, sulfur dioxide, electric power, cost savingsmarket-based instruments, prescriptive regulation, environmental policy, pollution control, sulfur dioxide, electric power, cost savings...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Under {{increasing}} {{signs of}} water shortages and depletions, fundamental questions {{need to be}} asked about why these <b>market-based</b> <b>instruments</b> did not work effectively {{at the local level}} in China. Answers to these questions are crucial for the analysis of water management in China. Originality: There is a rather large literature on this topic, but this article presents an important supplement to that literature in the realm of water allocation which remains a critical issue in China's ongoing economic restructuring. Key literature / theoretical perspective: the nature of decentralized decision-making authority in China, and the challenges that central mandates have in local implementation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopted a new angle for analyzing applications of <b>market-based</b> <b>instruments</b> towards water resources in China. By expanding the analysis beyond rational choice of economic instruments, it demonstrates the institution dimension of policy implementation at the local level in China. Findings: It argues that three peculiar features of China’s water institutions have created a context where local governments deal with abstraction activities differently from regulatory expectation, eventually leading to local governmental failure and affecting the implementation of water abstraction policies in several ways. Research limitations/implications: The issue of institutional barriers to the introduction of <b>market-based</b> <b>instruments</b> of resource allocation is of course key in China. Practical and Social implications: The understanding of water abstraction policies in China is worthwhile, both as an illustrative application of <b>market-based</b> <b>instruments</b> in a transitional and developing country, and as a case which sheds light on improving China’s water management system. 2 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Economic theory {{provides}} a coherent framework for analysing {{the elements of}} growth and sustainable development. Robust policies and appropriate institutional structures are essential to achieving sustainable development. Environmental problems are rooted in failed markets and their resolution requires government taking some kind of action – to establish property rights, set standards of liability, apply polluter pays taxes, or regulate. There is ample evidence showing that market based instruments can achieve the same environmental outcome at considerably less cost relative to command and control. Rational policy must seriously consider the use of <b>market-based</b> <b>instruments.</b> A framework for considering the quality of institutional structures vis-à-vis achieving sustainable development is presented. The framework is applied to aspects of the Resource Management Act 1991. Although the Act aims to promote sustainable management it is the primary legal foundation for sustainable development policy. One result of the Act was to devolve {{a great deal of}} environmental management and policy to local government.
