500|$|The common starling's {{gift for}} mimicry {{has long been}} recognised. In the medieval Welsh Mabinogion, Branwen tamed a common starling, [...] "taught it words", and sent it across the Irish Sea with a message to her brothers, Bran and Manawydan, who then sailed from Wales to Ireland to rescue her. Pliny the Elder claimed that these birds could be taught to speak whole {{sentences}} in Latin and Greek, and in Henry IV, William Shakespeare had Hotspur declare [...] "The king forbade <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> to speak of Mortimer. But I will find him when he is asleep, and in his ear I'll holler 'Mortimer!' Nay I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but Mortimer, {{and give it to}} him to keep his anger still in motion." ...|$|E
500|$|By far {{the most}} famous of Josquin's masses using the technique, {{and one of the most}} famous mass {{settings}} of the entire era, was the Missa pange lingua, based on the hymn by Thomas Aquinas for the Vespers of Corpus Christi. It was probably the last mass that Josquin composed. This mass is an extended fantasia on the tune, using the melody in all voices and in all parts of the mass, in elaborate and ever-changing polyphony. One of the high points of the mass is the et incarnatus est section of the Credo, where the texture becomes homophonic, and the tune appears in the topmost voice; here the portion which would normally set [...] "Sing, O <b>my</b> <b>tongue,</b> of the mystery of the divine body" [...] is instead given the words [...] "And he became incarnate by the Holy Ghost from the Virgin Mary, and was made man." ...|$|E
500|$|Mikey MiGo of 411mania {{wrote that}} the song is a [...] "welcomed change" [...] from Timberlake's past work. She stated that the song [...] "has qualities of Prince that I've never seen anyone muster up before". Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic called the song [...] "musically and melodically great", but criticized its lyrics. She {{wrote that the}} lyrics sound like the {{dialogue}} of a [...] "low-rent porn film", highlighting the lines: [...] "She's pressed up on me; I think she's ready to blow?" [...] and [...] "All I need is a moment alone, to give you <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> and {{get you out of}} control". According to Murray, [...] "It makes one question exactly what films Timberlake was starring in during his sabbatical." [...] She concluded that [...] "FutureSex/LoveSound" [...] establishes a pattern for the rest of FutureSex/LoveSounds: [...] "infectiously catchy and in many cases accomplished pop music, marred by retardedly retarded lyrics".|$|E

500|$|The couplet {{summarizes}} the sonnet in two lines, [...] "Therefore, like her, I sometime hold <b>my</b> <b>tongue,</b> because I would not dull {{you with my}} song". This is a clear statement from the poet vocalizing for the final time {{that he will not}} dull, bore, or represent his muse in a tedious way by creating a sonnet as exhausted and cliched as his contemporaries. In his analysis of the couplet, Stephen Booth compares the couplet to a proverb: [...] "My desire is not to dull you, if I cannot delight you." [...] Booth suggests that the poet does not wish to make his lover seem common with overabundant praise. Aitkins similarly suggests that the poet does not wish his praises to become annoying. Helen Vendler suggests that the poet uses proverbial language here to address the Fair Youth's seeming obsession with receiving praise; a personal plea would fall on deaf ears, so he makes his case rather impersonal.|$|E
500|$|Yitzhak Azulay {{composed}} the music played in Fill the Void. He chose primarily melodic and traditional pieces, using them frequently throughout the film. Other soundtrack is composed largely of contemporary Orthodox pop music, and the prayers are [...] "regularly chanted rather than spoken". The song [...] "Im Eshkachech Yerushalayim" [...] (Hebrew: אם אשכחך ירושלים, 'If I Forget Thee Jerusalem') features {{prominently in the}} film, playing at {{all three of the}} major events: the funeral, the Bris Milah, and the wedding. Azulay used an a cappella version of the song, which is derived from an excerpt of Psalm 137 and expresses the yearnings of the Jewish people in exile following the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BCE: [...] "If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither; Let <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> stick to my palate if I cease to think of you, if I do not keep Jerusalem in memory even at my happiest hour." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} hours of 28 April 1789, Bounty lay about [...] south of the island of Tofua. After a largely sleepless night, Christian had decided to act. He {{understood}} from his discussions with Young and Stewart which crewmen were his most likely supporters and, after approaching Quintal and Isaac Martin, he learned the names of several more. With the help of these men, Christian rapidly gained control of the upper deck; those who questioned his actions were ordered to keep quiet. At about 05:15, Christian went below, dismissed Hallett (who was sleeping on the chest containing the ship's muskets), and distributed arms to his followers before making for Bligh's cabin. Three men took hold of the captain and tied his hands, threatening to kill him if he raised the alarm; Bligh [...] "called as loudly as [...] could in hopes of assistance". The commotion woke Fryer, who saw, from his cabin opposite, the mutineers frogmarching Bligh away. The mutineers ordered Fryer to [...] "lay down again, and hold <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> or I was a dead man".|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{withstood}} {{a tremendous}} amount of punishment throughout the game. At one point in the first quarter, he bit his tongue while being tackled by Huff, causing him to swallow blood {{for the rest of the}} game. He also required six stitches at halftime to close a gash on his elbow. Some players wondered if he could even play in the second half. [...] "Taylor isn't human," [...] said Huff. [...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse beating on a football field. The Giants hit me hard, and then I hit the ground hard. I got it both ways. This was the toughest game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by letting my running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff hit me with his elbow after a tackle. Anyway, I cut <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E
500|$|The {{band had}} been flooded with [...] "hyperbolic praise," [...] and deemed [...] "the next big thing" [...] by {{multiple}} media outlets. Before recording the follow-up to its debut, the band released the acoustic EP/DVD My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to <b>My</b> <b>Tongue.</b> The EP was the band's first charting on the Billboard 200 at number 153. From Under the Cork Tree {{was recorded in}} Burbank, California, and served as {{the first time the}} band had stayed in California {{for an extended period of}} time. The group lived in corporate housing during the making of the album. In contrast to Take This to Your Graves rushed recording schedule, Fall Out Boy took a much more gradual pace while working on From Under the Cork Tree. It was the first Fall Out Boy record in which Stump created all the music and Wentz wrote all the lyrics, continuing the approach they took for some songs on Grave. Stump felt that this process was much more [...] "smooth" [...] as every member was able to focus on his individual strengths. He explained: [...] "We haven't had any of those moments when I play the music and he'll say, 'I don't like that,' and he'll read me lyrics and I'll say, 'I don't like those lyrics.' It's very natural and fun." [...] Despite this, the band had great difficulty creating its desired sound for the album, constantly scrapping new material. Two weeks before recording sessions began, the group abandoned ten songs and wrote eight more, including the album's first single, [...] "Sugar, We're Goin Down." ...|$|E

2500|$|The LDS temple rituals {{formerly}} {{provided an}} example in which capital punishment is contemplated for violation of historical blood oaths in the Endowment ritual.
