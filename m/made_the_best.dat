5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|Duval and Abt <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{starts in}} the field, gaining two {{positions}} {{by the end of}} the first lap while Piquet lost three positions over the same distance. At the end of the first lap, Turvey led from López, who in turn, was followed by Heidfeld, Vergne, Bird, Félix da Costa, Rosenqvist, Buemi, Carroll, Evans, Gutiérrez, Engel, Prost, di Grassi, Frijns, Abt, d'Ambrosio, Duval, Piquet and Sarrazin. The stewards deployed the safety car on the second lap to allow marshals to clear debris in the chicane. Prost made a pit stop for a nose cone replacement while Sarrazin elected to switch into his second car. Di Grassi rejoined the race on the same lap as the leading drivers but was now at the back of the field. Turvey led the field back up to speed at the lap-five restart, closely followed by López. Buemi immediately attacked Rosenqvist and passed him for sixth place and started to draw closer to Bird. López began to pressure Turvey for the lead with Heidfeld and Vergne close in arrears. Jaguar teammates Evans and Carroll began battling for eighth while Gutiérrez lost tenth to both Andretti cars of Félix da Costa and Frijns with Abt gaining further positions to run in 12th. At the entry to turn 13, Turvey had power issues with his car, and slowed on the start/finish straight, handing the lead to López. Turvey stopped at the turn one exit.|$|E

50|$|The plasticine-shaping {{aspect of}} the game, similar to Rapidough or Sculptorades, has a {{significant}} appeal to young players. However, since the game rewards players whose sculptures are guessed later in <b>the</b> game, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> sculptures are not necessarily those <b>made</b> by <b>the</b> <b>best</b> sculptor - but more likely those <b>made</b> by <b>the</b> <b>best</b> riddler. That, together with the spend-or-roll mechanic which reduces the impact of luck, make the game interesting for serious gamers.|$|R

5|$|Heidfeld lost {{hydraulic}} {{pressure on the}} grid; he was required to use the spare Sauber monocoque and start from the pit lane. Fisichella did the same {{because he had a}} fuel leak in his car. When the race started, Montoya maintained his pole position advantage going into the first corner, with Barrichello in second and Michael Schumacher in third. Ralf Schumacher passed Michael Schumacher at the Variante Goodyear chicane but Michael challenged Ralf for the position at the exit of Variante della Roggia and got ahead heading into the Curve di Lesmo. Further back, Trulli was hit by Button and was sent into a spin and became the first retirement of the race. Button made a pit stop {{at the end of the}} lap for a replacement front wing. Irvine made a good start, rising from thirteenth to seventh by the end of the first lap, while Häkkinen made a poor gateway after going through the chicane to avoid making contact with other drivers and fell to thirteenth. Verstappen <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> start, moving from nineteenth to eighth. At the end of the first lap, Montoya led by half a second from Barrichello, who in turn was followed by Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Coulthard, de la Rosa, Irvine, Verstappen, Räikkönen, Alesi, Villeneuve, Bernoldi, Häkkinen, Panis, Frentzen, Alonso, Enge, Heidfeld, Yoong, Fisichella and Button.|$|E

The general view was and still is that Huxley got much the better of the exchange though Wilberforce himself thought he had done quite well. In the absence of a verbatim report differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly; Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin, a letter which does not survive; however, a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the summer}} of 1754, {{on the eve of the}} French and Indian War, Weiser was a member of a Pennsylvania {{delegation}} to Albany. London had invoked the meeting, hoping to win assurances of Iroquois support in the looming war with the French. Present were representatives of the Iroquois and seven colonies. Because of divisions within both the British and Native American ranks, the council did not result in the treaty of support that the crown desired. Instead, each colony <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> deal it could with individual Iroquois leaders. Weiser was able to negotiate one of the more successful, in which some lower-level chiefs deeded to the colony most of the land remaining in present-day Pennsylvania, including the southwestern part, still claimed by Virginia.|$|E
