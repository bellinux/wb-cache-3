Recently, an enhancement for low volume specimens using cup and pin mini <b>measuring</b> <b>cells</b> (MiniCup) was invented for scientific non-clinical use. The MiniCup <b>measuring</b> <b>cells</b> allow testing {{with half of}} the blood volume required to run a test as compared to the conventional ROTEM® cup and pin (150 μL vs. 300 μL per assay). OBJECTIVES: The aim of this prospective study was to compare ROTEM® results using conventional cups and pins to the results of the MiniCup <b>measuring</b> <b>cells.</b> METHODS: Blood samples drawn during major pediatric surgery were analyzed using the conventional ROTEM® and the MiniCup system to compare parameters from the EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM assays. RESULTS: Citrated blood samples (n = 120) from 70 pediatric patients were analyzed. Results of the MiniCup cells were considerably different than the conventional ROTEM® cups and pins measurements. The MiniCup results show less clot firmness and demonstrate higher variability in the parameters reflecting the kinetics of clot building. CONCLUSION: The MiniCup <b>measuring</b> <b>cells</b> may offer advantages in pediatric care or research facilities, but specific reference ranges need to be established first, and adequate reproducibility must be determined by further studies before clinical use can be recommended...|$|R

30|$|This {{approach}} using SPR spectrometer can {{be realized}} as follows: (1) a level of sensor response corresponding to hybridization of the immobilized oligonucleotide probes with target oligonucleotides in the linear range SPR biosensor at the initial (room) temperature should be determined and (2) SPR biosensor <b>measuring</b> <b>cell</b> should be washed by the buffer solution at a specified elevated temperature for {{a certain period of}} time (in this work— 5  min). As a result of this procedure, certain duplexes will be melted and the buffer solution flowing through the <b>measuring</b> <b>cell</b> will wash out the separated target oligonucleotides. After this, washout and subsequent cooling of the <b>measuring</b> <b>cell</b> to the initial temperature, sensor response, which will reflect the amount of the remaining duplexes should be determined.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process and an arrangement for alternating test and background measurement, in particular for highly sensitive absorption spectroscopy selective gas analysis. Instead of a previously usual exchange of sample air or sample gas in a <b>measuring</b> <b>cell</b> to receive a sample-free zero air, the invention foresees applying a magnetic and/or electrical field to the trace or test gas in the <b>measuring</b> <b>cell</b> for a predetermined period of time. As {{a result of the}} effect of the field, a shift in the energy level of the gas molecules takes place in the <b>measuring</b> <b>cell</b> acc. to the strong or Zeeman effect. Sensitivity-limiting background structures are not influenced by the field effect. In a viewed measuring window, sample and background measurements can then be performed in succession without any time delay by cyclically alternating the activation and deactivation of the field. By not physically replacing the gas in the <b>measuring</b> <b>cell,</b> as previously was the case, but shifting the position of the characteristic spectral signatures for the species under investigation, the background structure can be determined in the temporal signal-free spectral measuring window in the usual way. As a result of the invention, drift effects of the absorption-spectroscopy measuring instrument can be reduced, whereby at the same time an increase in measuring sensitivity can be obtained...|$|E
