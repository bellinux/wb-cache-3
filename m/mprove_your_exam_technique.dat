40|$|Here {{are some}} tips to help you stay calm during exams, {{so that you can}} reach your potential. 1. Start to prepare for <b>your</b> <b>exams</b> well in advance. Try to keep up with your uni work on a day to day basis if you can. Avoid relying on last minute cramming {{in the days leading up}} to an exam. 2. Put the exam in perspective. It is only an exam. The result is not a {{reflection}} of who you are as a person. If you invest too much of your self-worth in studying and exams it can create additional stress and anxiety. 3. Get a good night’s sleep beforehand. It’s important that you feel rested on the day of the exam. Even 4 - 5 hours may be enough. It’s hard to produce your best work in the exam if you are feeling exhausted. 4. Eat sensibly before the exam. Some people overeat when they are feeling anxious, while others stop eating at all. Eating a nutritious meal can help you feel physically comfortable and stay alert and focused for <b>your</b> <b>exam...</b>|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To explore {{graduate}} {{nurse practitioner}} students 2 ̆ 7 {{perceptions of their}} experiences when learning to perform pelvic examinations in the laboratory and performing them in subsequent clinical rotations. One group was taught by faculty with voluntary peer examination, {{and the other two}} groups were taught by standardized patients (SPs). DATA SOURCES: Surveys with open- and closed-ended (responses on Likert scales) items administered twice during 3 consecutive years to students enrolled in an advanced health assessment course. CONCLUSIONS: All groups reported feeling anxious while learning pelvic <b>exam</b> <b>techniques</b> and in subsequent clinical experiences. SPs provided immediate feedback to students, decreased their feelings of anxiety, and increased their confidence in performing examinations. Students who were taught pelvic examination techniques by SPs rated their learning experiences more positively and reported a better understanding of <b>exam</b> <b>techniques</b> than students who learned to perform exams by voluntary examination of classmates. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Graduate nursing programs should consider locating and using SP programs for teaching pelvic examinations in advanced health assessment courses. Although more cost-effective, voluntary peer examination was a less effective teaching method...|$|R
