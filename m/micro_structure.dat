Three samples exhibiting different <b>micro</b> <b>structured</b> surfaces with arithmetical mean heights Sa {{in a range of}} 148 nm to 741 nm were manufactured by micro milling. The surface texture is determined by the process parameters of the micro milling operation. Tribological properties of the <b>micro</b> <b>structured</b> surfaces were investigated by means of a ball-on-plate micro tribometer and compared to those of a polished reference sample (Sa = 24 nm), a clear dependence of the frictional properties on the surface roughness was found. Lowest friction Î¼ = 0. 26 was achieved for the sample with a roughness Sa = 148 nm. Surfaces with higher or lower roughness provoked increased friction in tribological testing being associated with an interlocking of surfaceâ s asperities or dominant adhesion, respectively. Subsequently, <b>micro</b> <b>structures</b> were machined into the surface of a micro deep drawing die for drawing of rectangular micro cups.

The advantage of water atomization is that metal solidifies faster than by gas atomization since the heat capacity of water is some magnitudes higher than gases. Since the solidification rate is inversely proportional to the particle size, smaller particles can be made using water atomization. The smaller the particles, the more homogeneous the <b>micro</b> <b>structure</b> will be. Notice that particles will have a more irregular shape and the particle size distribution will be wider.
