40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the contribution of the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 promoter methylation in the pathogenesis of sporadic breast cancer in Tunisian patients. Methods: Breast carcinoma tissues (n= 117) and available paired normal breast tissues (n= 65) from Tunisian women who had no family history were investigated for the methylation status of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 promoters using methylation-specific PCR. Breast specimens from women without carcinoma (16 fibroadenomas and 5 <b>mastopathies)</b> were used as control. Results: Hypermethylation of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 promoters was detected respectively in 60. 7 % and 69. 2 % of the carcinoma tissues, and in only 7. 7 % and 4. 6 % of the paired normal breast tissues. None of the fibroadenomas and <b>mastopathies</b> showed hypermethylation. Correlations were found between BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 hypermethylation and decrease in their mRNA expression (p= 0. 02 and p= 0. 009, respectively). Moreover, BRCA 1 methylation correlates with patients age (p= 0. 01) and triple negative (ER-, PR-, HER 2 -) tumors (p= 0. 01). Patients with methylated BRCA 1 and/or BRCA 2 had a significant prolonged survivals compared to those with unmethylated tumors (p= 0. 002). Conclusion: Our results suggest an important role of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 promoter methylation in breast cancer development in the Tunisian population. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Distribution of {{estrogen}} (ER), progesterone (PR) receptors, and {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF) receptors was assayed by dual staining immunohistochemistry on 28 selected cytosolic ER-positive breast carcinomas and 22 nonmalignant breast tissues. ER-positive tumor cells were detected in 26 (93 %) and EGF receptor positive tumor cells were detected in 7 (25 %) carcinomas. In five tumors both ER and EGF receptors were detected but localized in distinct tumor cells. Only in one case of ductal carcinoma in situ co-expression was observed in a subset of tumor cells. In contrast, simultaneous expression of ER/PR and EGF receptors was observed in non-neoplastic ductal remnants {{in the majority of}} the carcinomas and the fibroadenomas. In addition, double-positive cells were occasionally detected in luminal epithelial cells of normal breast tissue and <b>mastopathies.</b> This study shows that ER/PR and EGF receptors in breast tumor cells are inversely related at the single cell level.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of biological tissues and their pathological alterations. For this purpose, diffusion is measured by NMR in the fringe field of a large superconductor with a field gradient of 50 T/m, which is rather homogenous and stable. It {{is due to the}} unprecedented properties of the gradient that we are able not only to determine the usual diffusion coefficient, but also to observe the pronounced Non-Debye feature of the relaxation function due to cellular structure. The dynamics of the probability density follow a stretched exponential or Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts function. In the long time limit the Fourier transform of the probability density follows a long-tail Lévy function, whose asymptotic is related to the fractal dimension of the underlying cellular structure. Some of the properties of Lévy walk statistics are discussed and its potential importance in understanding certain biophysical phenomena like diffusion processes in biological tissues are pointed out. We present and discuss for the first time NMR data giving evidence for Lévy processes that capture the essential features of the observed power law (scaling) dynamics of water diffusion in fresh tissue specimens: carcinomas, fibrous <b>mastopathies,</b> adipose and liver tissues...|$|R
