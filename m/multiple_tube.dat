40|$|It {{is known}} that in the Minkowski vacuum a bunch of IIA {{superstrings}} with D 0 -branes can be blown-up to a supersymmetric tubular D 2 -brane. As {{the energy of the}} tubular D 2 -brane is proportional to the charge therein a tube could therefore split into <b>multiple,</b> smaller <b>tubes</b> without spending the system energy. In this paper we show that in the Melvin magnetic <b>tube</b> background the <b>multiple</b> <b>tubes</b> will fuse into a single, larger tube to stabilize the system. However, in the uniform magnetic field background, then depending on the magnitude of the magnetic field, the <b>multiple</b> <b>tubes</b> will fuse into a single, larger tube or, on the other hand, the tube will split into <b>multiple,</b> smaller <b>tubes</b> to stabilize the system...|$|R

The numerical analysis is based on the minimum potential energy principle in conjunction with the variational approach. The shear-lag phenomenon of such structures is studied taking into account the additional bending moments in the tubes.

50|$|Like other {{vacuum tubes}} of US and Japanese manufacture, the RETMA tube {{designation}} system {{was used to}} designate identical tubes across different manufacturers. Any variations from the original electrical design specifications required a change to the tube designation code. As a result, a number of cross-reference resources exist.

50|$|One of {{the oldest}} methods is called the <b>multiple</b> <b>tube</b> method. In this method a {{measured}} sub-sample (perhaps 10 ml) is diluted with 100 ml of sterile growth medium and an aliquot of 10 ml is then decanted into each of ten tubes. The remaining 10 ml is then diluted again and the process repeated. At the end of 5 dilutions this produces 50 tubes covering the dilution range of 1:10 through to 1:10000.|$|E

5000|$|A cake {{firework}}, {{also known}} as a <b>multiple</b> <b>tube</b> device is a firework comprising a series of Roman candles, small aerial shells, or a combination of both, connected together by a high-speed fuse. [...] Typically, the internal fusing is set to fire each tube in series, or to fire several tubes at the same time, or a combination of these. Typically a cake will resemble from the outside a simple cube or other rectangular covered shape; after firing, a large number of cardboard tubes (the candles) will be visible {{in the top of the}} firework (the paper cover having been blown off by the discharging stars). In a traditional cake, all the candles point upwards; a variant is called the fan or angle cake.|$|E
5000|$|Brittle {{stars are}} the most agile of the echinoderms, raising their discs and taking strides when moving. The two forward arms grip the {{substrate}} with their tube feet, the two side arms [...] "row", the hindermost arm trails and the animal moves in jerks. The arm spines provide traction and when moving among objects, the supple arms can coil around things. A few species creep around on pointed tube feet. Starfish extend their tube feet in the intended direction of travel and grip the substrate by suction, after which the feet are drawn backwards. The movement of <b>multiple</b> <b>tube</b> feet, coordinated in waves, moves the animal forward, but progress is slow.

50|$|A {{condenser}} unit used in central {{air conditioning systems}} typically has a heat exchanger section to cool down and condense incoming refrigerant vapor into liquid, a compressor to raise {{the pressure of the}} refrigerant and move it along, and a fan for blowing outside air through the heat exchanger section to cool the refrigerant inside. A typical configuration of such a {{condenser unit}} is as follows: The heat exchanger section wraps around the sides of the unit with the compressor inside. In this heat exchanger section, the refrigerant goes through <b>multiple</b> <b>tube</b> passes, which are surrounded by heat transfer fins through which cooling air can move from outside to inside the unit. There is a motorized fan inside the condenser unit near the top, which is covered by some grating to keep any objects from accidentally falling inside on the fan. The fan is used to blow the outside cooling air in through the heat exchange section at the sides and out the top through the grating. These condenser units are located {{on the outside of the}} building they are trying to cool, with tubing between the unit and building, one for vapor refrigerant entering and another for liquid refrigerant leaving the unit. Of course, an electric power supply is needed for the compressor and fan inside the unit.|$|E

40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to {{identify}} an experimental procedure using PCR that provides a reliable genotype at a microsatellite locus using only a few picograms of template DNA. Under these circumstances, it is possible (i) that one allele of a heterozygous individual will not be detected and (ii) that PCR-generated alleles or 'false alleles' will arise. A mathematical model has been developed to account for stochastic events when pipetting template DNA in a very dilute DNA extract and computer simulations have been performed. Laboratory experiments were also carried out using DNA extracted from a bear feces sample to determine if experimental results correlate with the mathematical model. The results of 150 typing experiments {{are consistent with the}} proposed model. Based on this model and the level of observed false alleles, an experimental procedure using the <b>multiple</b> <b>tubes</b> approach is proposed to obtain reliable genotypes with a confidence level of 99 %. This <b>multiple</b> <b>tubes</b> procedure should be systematically used when genotyping nuclear loci of ancient or forensic samples, museum specimens and hair or feces of free ranging animals...|$|R

40|$|Coliform {{group has}} been {{extensively}} used {{as an indicator of}} drinking water quality and historically led to the public health protection concept. <b>Multiple</b> <b>tube</b> fermentation technique has been currently used for assessment of the microbial quality of drinking water. This method, however, has limitations. Enzymatic assay constitute an alternative approach for detecting indicator bacteria, namely total coliforms and E. coli in various aquatic environments. This study compared the performance of LMX® broth as an enzymatic assay with the standard methods <b>multiple</b> <b>tube</b> fermentation technique and presence–absence test, for the detection of indicator coliforms in drinking water samples. In addition, the potential effect of water quality on the microbial detection method was assayed through measurement of some physicochemical parameters. From the 50 drinking water samples tested, 8 (16 %) and 7 (14 %) contained total coliforms and E. coli as indicated by all three techniques. Although on average the LMX recovered more total coliforms and E. Coli numbers comparing to <b>multiple</b> <b>tube</b> fermentation, but there was no significant difference. A significant difference existed between the level of residual chlorine for positive and negative samples. In conclusion, enzymatic assay showed a rapid and less labor method, allowing the simultaneous detection of total coliforms and E. coli. The method is particularly useful in the early warning of fecal pollution of drinking water...|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{limitations}} of well clusters and nested wells and a desire for monitoring more vertical intervals, researchers at the University of Waterloo (Canada) developed a MLS to collect depth-discrete groundwater samples at a landfill site in Ontario, Canada (Pickens et al. 1978).

The number of distributions which have been made is 7 and 92 laboratories are now participating. The methods used for preparing and distributing samples are described. Some participating laboratories use the <b>multiple</b> <b>tube</b> method and some use membrane filtration to assess the presence of coliforms and Escherichia coli. The results are, therefore, a mixture of estimated numbers and direct colony counts. In order to compare results from these two different laboratory methods statistical tables have been compiled to show the most likely <b>multiple</b> <b>tube</b> result corresponding to each colony count. Tables relating to two commonly used tenfold dilution series are presented. To illustrate how these tables may be used we present results from a typical quality control distribution.
