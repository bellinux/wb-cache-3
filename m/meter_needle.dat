50|$|The Contaflex Super, {{launched}} the following year, {{was based on}} the Rapid and had a coupled selenium exposure meter on the front side of the prism. It is easily recognized by the wheel on the front plate for the setting of the film speed (DIN).

50|$|Because the {{magnetic}} field is polarised, the <b>meter</b> <b>needle</b> acts in opposite directions for each direction of current. A DC ammeter is thus sensitive to which way round it is connected; most are marked with a positive terminal, but some have centre-zero mechanisms and can display currents in either direction. A moving coil meter indicates the average (mean) of a varying current through it, which is zero for AC. For this reason moving-coil meters are only usable directly for DC, not AC.|$|E

40|$|There is no {{fundamental}} {{limit to}} the precision of a classical measurement. The position of a <b>meter's</b> <b>needle</b> can be determined with an arbitrarily small uncertainty. In the quantum realm, however, fundamental quantum fluctuations due to the Heisenberg principle limit the measurement precision. The simplest measurement procedures, involving semi-classical states of the meter, lead to a fluctuation-limited imprecision at the standard quantum limit. By engineering the quantum state of the meter system, the measurement imprecision can be reduced down to the fundamental Heisenberg Limit (HL). Quantum-enabled metrology techniques are thus in high demand and the focus of an intense activity. We report here a quantum-enabled measurement of an electric field based on this approach. We cast Rydberg atoms in Schrödinger cat states, superpositions of atomic levels with radically different polarizabilites. We use a quantum interference process to perform a measurement close to the HL, reaching a single-shot sensitivity of 1. 2 mV/cm for a 100 ns interaction time, corresponding to 30 μV/cm/Hz^(1 / 2) at our 3 kHz repetition rate. This highly sensitive, non-invasive space- and time-resolved field measurement extends the realm of electrometric techniques and could have important practical applications. Detection of individual electrons in mesoscopic devices at a 100 μm distance, with a MegaHertz bandwith is within reach...|$|R
50|$|The {{camera was}} fully manual, with a {{built-in}} CdS light meter. The battery was only for the metering circuit. The user needed to push {{a button on the}} front of the camera to close the aperture, and then set the aperture ring on the lens to a value where the <b>meter</b> <b>needle</b> would fit inside a marker ring. After this, the user could let go of the button, and have full light in the viewfinder to compose the picture.On release of the shutter, the aperture would close to the correct setting.|$|E

50|$|From {{the late}} 1980s {{competition}} and technical innovations made 35 mm camera systems more versatile and sophisticated by adding more advanced light metering capabilities such as spot-metering; limited area metering such as used by Canon with the F1 series; matrix metering as used by Nikon, exposure communication with dedicated electronic flash units. The user interface also changed on many cameras, replacing <b>meter</b> <b>needle</b> displays that were galvanometer-based and thereby fragile, with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{and then with}} more comprehensive liquid crystal displays (LCDs) both in the SLR viewfinder and externally on the cameras' top plate using an LCD screen. Wheels and buttons replaced the shutter dial on the camera and the aperture ring on the lens on many models, although some photographers still prefer shutter dials and aperture rings. Some manufacturers introduced image stabilization on certain lenses to combat camera shake and to allow longer hand-held exposures without using a tripod. This feature is especially useful with long telephoto lenses.|$|E

After evacuation and flushing with N 2 (three times) and ethylene (twice), the reaction vessel was charged with a quantity of cyclohexane and magnetically stirred under ambient ethylene atmosphere. When the desired reaction temperature was established, a quantity of MAO/alkylaluminum activator, PNP ligand and CrCl 3 (THF) 3 were injected into the reactor. Typically 30  min later, the mixture was rapidly cooled to 0  °C and then the reaction was quenched through the addition of EtOH/HCl (10  wt%). The catalytic activity was calculated from the increase in product weight.|$|R
5000|$|... 1959: Zeiss Ikon Contarex (West Germany): first SLR with a {{built-in}} light meter coupled to a viewfinder exposure control indicator - a galvanometer needle pointer. It had an external, circular selenium photoelectric cell mounted above the lens; earning it [...] "Bullseye" [...] (in USA) and [...] "Cyclops" [...] (in UK) nicknames. For proper exposure, the photographer would adjust the meter, which was also coupled to the shutter speed and lens aperture, until the needle was centered on a mark. (The Carl Braun Paxette Reflex Germany leaf shutter SLR had an external top mounted, coupled light <b>meter</b> <b>needle</b> system in 1958.) The Contarex also had interchangeable film backs, a feature common with medium format SLRs and used in a few 35 mm rangefinder cameras, but almost exclusive to Contarex/Contaflex series among 35 mm SLRs. Although Contarex SLRs and their Zeiss lenses were of extremely high quality, they were also extremely expensive and of idiosyncratic (even clumsy) handling.|$|E
50|$|Some early SLRs {{featured}} a built-in CdS meter usually {{on the front}} {{left side of the}} top plate, as in the Minolta SR-7. Other manufacturers, such as Miranda and Nikon introduced a CdS prism which fitted to their interchangeable prism SLR cameras. Nikon's early Photomic finder utilized a cover in front of the cell which was raised and a reading was taken and the photographer would either turn the coupled shutter speed dial and/or the coupled aperture ring to center a galvanometer-based <b>meter</b> <b>needle</b> shown in the viewfinder. The disadvantage of this early Photomic prism finder was that the meter had no ON/OFF switch so the meter was constantly 'ON', thus draining battery power. A later Photomic housing had an ON/OFF switch on the Pentaprism. CdS light meters proved more sensitive to light and thus metering in available light situations was becoming more prominent and useful. Further advances in CdS sensitivity, however, were needed as, CdS cells suffered from a 'memory effect'. That is, if exposed to bright sunlight, the cell would require many minutes to return to normal operation and sensitivity.|$|E
5000|$|With Zeiss Ikon Contaflex Super B, when in {{automatic}} mode, when {{changing the}} shutter speed, the camera automatically selects the right aperture {{according to the}} value indicated by the built in selenium meter needle.In the beginnings of exposure automation (ca. 1960) the instruments were even used for setting exposure settings directly, mainly for automatic aperture setting. A simple method for this was called [...] "trap-needle"; pressing the shutter release mechanically gripped the <b>meter</b> <b>needle,</b> then moved an aperture control up to hit the needle, setting the aperture to a value controlled by the meter.This kind of attempt to automate exposure setting was common in an era were precision mechanical engineers didn't know any limits of complication so that even further steps were gone to use selenium photo cells to control all exposure settings, or to control them more exactly with help of electro-mechanical aids. Heinz Waaske's SLR construction Edixa Electronica was such a costly attempt. The construction problem was the low electric power delivered by the photo cell. It was a precision mechanical wonder that a handful of cameras were made which had automatic exposure control driven by a selenium meter, without need of further electronic or electromechanical support, for example the Optima.|$|E
5000|$|In {{automatic}} mode, the FE's black needle {{indicates the}} shutter speed automatically {{set by the}} electronic circuitry {{in response to the}} light reaching the <b>meter.</b> The green <b>needle</b> is used to indicate that the FE is in [...] "A" [...] mode.

50|$|Operating {{positions}} for 2-port valves {{can be either}} shut (closed) so that no flow at all goes through, fully open for maximum flow, or sometimes partially open to any degree in between. Many valves are not designed to precisely control intermediate degree of flow; such valves {{are considered to be}} either open or shut. Some valves are specially designed to regulate varying amounts of flow. Such valves have been called by various names such as regulating, throttling, <b>metering,</b> or <b>needle</b> valves. For example, needle valves have elongated conically-tapered discs and matching seats for fine flow control. For some valves, there may be a mechanism to indicate by how much the valve is open, but in many cases other indications of flow rate are used, such as separate flow meters.|$|R
50|$|The OM-1 is an all-mechanical SLR. It {{has a large}} {{viewfinder}} with interchangeable screens but a fixed prism. It {{also has}} a through-the-lens exposure <b>meter</b> controlling a <b>needle</b> visible in the viewfinder. It has a compact body, essentially retained on later models. The shutter speed dial is located around the lens mount, which allows photographers to keep the camera at the eye between shots more easily than SLRs with the dial located on the top plate.|$|R
5000|$|Two leaf-shuttered lenses {{were also}} made available, first the 90mm 2.8 {{and later a}} 165mm 2.8 that both {{allowing}} flash sync at all speeds, thereby solving many mirror and shutter vibration problems as well as allowing for fast shutter speeds for use with strobes and portable flashes while in bright shooting conditions. Lenses {{are linked to the}} body by the operation of the aperture stop-down lever being tripped. The camera body is set to the [...] "time-exposure" [...] setting. The through-the-lens (TTL) metering pentaprism viewfinder and included a knurled shutter dial ring with fitted case. The TTL-metered Pentaprism is the same coverage as the non-metered pentaprism, a coverage of 90% of frame and has a sensitivity pattern of 60% center-weight and 30% inner field sensitivity. The TTL Metering Pentaprism has no internal power of its own, instead, the operating power comes from one of the three contacts found in the finder bay of the body as well as grounding to the body. Only two of the three contacts are utilized and depending on the two modes: Normal as 'AUTO' mode and in an override to stopdown mode in the 'MAN' mode as found on many equipped lenses. In 'AUTO' is where the lens is fully opened and adjustments are read from the coupled index from the lens-through the index ring of the body mount-to the chain and index shuttle, the TTL-Meter receives the position information via a protruding tab facing the finder bay. The tab operates a linear potentiometer. In 'MAN' or manual mode with so equipped lenses, the sliding of the lens switch will move an internal lever that then presses down on the activating switch in the body. The switch is located inside the pin of the lens release pin. This inner pin is connected to an electrical toggle inside the body and switches the current from body grounded to bay connector to activate the secondary circuit. The installation of the TTL-Meter into the finder bay requires first the removal or turning of the lens to remove tension on the aperture chain. When the lens is rotated to allow the index on the chain to properly match up with the tab under the meter, the finder can then be seated and firmly pressed until the locks {{on either side of the}} finder latch. Removal of the finder is the reverse by first removing the lens and then pressing in the locks on the sides of the finder and lifting out. The physical difference of the TTL-Meter to the regular prism is the bulky arm that extends to the shutter speed dial. The dial covers the body dial and is coupled via a spring loaded index to the shutter speed dial. The included knurled ring assists the reach of the shutter speed dial due to the bulk of the TTL-Meter prism. The stop-down mode or direct metering through while the aperture is allowed to operate and change the amount of light, is similar to the 'MAN' mode, but activates when a non-auto-aperture lens is mounted causing index ring to be positioned to place the meter's linear potenioment into a bypass mode to activate the secondary circuit in the meter. The lens is allowed to stop-down and the light is directly measured, however, the shutter speed dial link operates the same in 'MAN' mode. As did the body receiving improvements over time, so did the TTL-Meter have had some changes. Although the image coverage remained unchanged, the type of metering and the circuitry received some upgrades. CdS (cadmium sulfide) to Gpd (gallium photo diode) photo cells and a two part circuit to a single board to improve response time and reliability. The early version is identified by the single marked 'ON' switch and the <b>meter</b> <b>needle</b> starts from UP to down and the later model has a 'ON' & 'OFF' marked switch and the <b>meter</b> <b>needle</b> starts from BOTTOM to top. The later model would also have the sole PENTAX badge by 1986.|$|E

40|$|Summary Variation in {{specific}} needle area (SNA; cm 2 pro-jected fresh needle area g– 1 oven-dried needle weight) was in-vestigated {{in relation to}} needle age, within-crown position and epicormic shoot production in 450 -year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. (Franco) var. menziesii) trees. Specific needle area decreased with increasing needle age. The magnitude and rate of change in SNA with needle age were greatest for lower-crown branches, and decreased toward the middle- and upper-crown branches. For all branches, {{there was no difference}} between regular and epicormic shoots in the rela-tionship between SNA and needle age. Specific needle area de-creased with increasing distance from branch base, and this relationship was significant for the majority of needle age classes of the upper- and middle-crown branches. In the lower-crown branches, SNA did not vary with distance from branch base for the majority of needle age classes. For all branches, {{there was no difference between}} regular and epicormic shoots in the relationship between SNA and distance from branch base for the majority of needle age classes. These results indi-cate that renewal of foliage by epicormic shoot production maintains needle quality. Branch SNA increased linearly with decreasing height in the crown at a mean rate of 0. 951 ± 0. 110 cm 2 g– 1 per vertical <b>meter.</b> Total <b>needle</b> area of branches was estimated from total needle dry weight taking into account within-branch variation in SNA. Analyses of allometric rela-tionships between branch size and foliage amount (needle area and needle dry weight) showed that branch length was a better predictor of foliage amount than branch diameter for old Douglas-fir trees. Total needle dry weight and needle area of the sample trees, estimated from branch length and branch height and taking into account vertical within-crown variation in branch SNA, ranged from 42. 4 to 154. 2 kg and from 246. 2 to 816. 0 m 2 per tree, respectively...|$|R
