5|$|As a {{condition}} of being allowed to disinter the skeleton, the archaeologists agreed that, if Richard were found, his remains would be reburied in Leicester Cathedral. A controversy arose as to whether an alternative reburial site, York Minster or Westminster Abbey, would be more suitable. A legal challenge confirmed there were no public law grounds for the courts {{to be involved in}} that decision. Reinterment took place in Leicester on 26 March 2015, during a televised memorial service held {{in the presence of the}} Archbishop of Canterbury and senior <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> Christian denominations.|$|E

5|$|In West Africa, {{the sons}} and daughters of Yoruba kings were {{traditionally}} given in marriage to their fellow royals as a matter of dynastic policy. Sometimes these marriages would involve <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> tribes. Erinwinde of Benin, for example, was taken as a wife by the Oba Oranyan of Oyo during his time as governor of Benin.

5|$|In late 1857, Bologna's inquisitor Father Pier Feletti {{heard that}} Anna Morisi, {{who had worked}} in the Mortara house for six years, had {{secretly}} baptised Edgardo when she had thought he was about to die as a baby. The Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition held that this made the child irrevocably a Catholic and, because the Papal States forbade the raising of Christians by <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> faiths, ordered that he be taken from his family and brought up by the Church. Police came to the Mortara home late on 23 June 1858 and removed Edgardo the following evening.|$|E
5|$|Kozelsk and Starobelsk {{were used}} mainly for {{military}} officers, while Ostashkov was used mainly for Polish Scouting, gendarmes, police officers, and prison officers.

5|$|Males {{mark their}} territories with dung piles and by urine spraying.

The Sumatran and Javan rhinos, while defecating in piles, do not engage in the scraping. This adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological; in the wet forests of Java and Sumatra, the method may not be useful for spreading odors.|$|E

Green Goblin is later shown having gathered a new gang of followers together in the sewers formed from discarded <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> villains' gangs like Vulture, Owl and the third White Dragon's gangs. These henchmen escaped their organizations unharmed because Superior Spider-Man is more focused on the larger threats (where the original Spider-Man would focus on individuals).|$|E

5|$|After a punitive {{operation}} {{was conducted in}} the surrounding villages, during which 422males were shot and four villages burned down, another 70male Jews and communists who had been arrested in Kragujevac were shot. Simultaneously, males {{between the ages of}} 16and 60, including high school students, were assembled by German troops and local collaborators, and the victims were selected from amongst them. The selected males were then marched to fields outside the city, shot with heavy machine guns, and their bodies buried in mass graves. Contemporary German military records indicate that 2,300hostages were shot. After the war, inflated estimates ranged as high as 7,000deaths, but German and Serbian scholars have now agreed on the figure of nearly 2,800killed, including 144high school students. As well as Serbs, other massacre victims included Jews, Romani people, Muslims, Macedonians, Slovenes and <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> nationalities.|$|E
5|$|Amin retaliated {{against the}} {{attempted}} invasion by Ugandan exiles in 1972, by purging {{the army of}} Obote supporters, predominantly those from the Acholi and Lango ethnic groups. In July 1971, Lango and Acholi soldiers were massacred in the Jinja and Mbarara barracks. By early 1972, some 5,000 Acholi and Lango soldiers, and {{at least twice as}} many civilians, had disappeared. The victims soon came to include <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> ethnic groups, religious leaders, journalists, artists, senior bureaucrats, judges, lawyers, students and intellectuals, criminal suspects, and foreign nationals. In this atmosphere of violence, many other people were killed for criminal motives or simply at will. Bodies were often dumped into the River Nile.|$|E

5|$|Darah dan Doa was {{released}} in 1950 and distributed by Spectra Film Exchange. It was given the English title The Long March, which the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests is {{a reference to the}} Chinese Long March of 1934. Not long after the film's release, a two-pronged controversy grew around it, which resulted in the film being banned in parts of the country. <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> military divisions considered the film to put too much emphasis on Siliwangi's role, while members of the general public had difficulty believing that Darul Islam could have betrayed the national cause. Ultimately the film required President Sukarno's permission to be re-released in September 1950, after he received a private screening at the Presidential Palace in mid-1950. However, several scenes had to be cut.|$|E
5|$|Discrimination against Jews began {{immediately}} after the seizure of power and following a month-long series of attacks {{by members of the}} SA on Jewish businesses, synagogues and members of the legal profession, on 1 April 1933 Hitler declared a national boycott of Jewish businesses. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service passed on 7 April and forced all non-Aryan civil servants to retire from the legal profession and civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> professions of their right to practise and on 11 April a decree was promulgated that stated anyone who had even one Jewish parent or grandparent was considered non-Aryan. As part of the drive to remove Jewish influence from cultural life, members of the National Socialist Student League removed from libraries any books considered un-German and a nationwide book burning was held on 10 May.|$|E
5|$|Discrimination against Jews, longstanding but extralegal {{throughout}} much of Europe at the time, was codified in Germany immediately after the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933.

Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> professions {{of the right to}} practise. Violence and economic pressure were used by the regime to force Jews to leave the country. Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks and boycotts of their businesses.|$|E
