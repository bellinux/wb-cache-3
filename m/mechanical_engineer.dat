Soon, the <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Engineers</b> of Ahmadabad joined hands with their counterparts in Bombay to put up a strong lobbying group which would protect the interest of <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineers.</b> The umbrella group of <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineers</b> were called the [...] "MECHANICAL ENGINEER'S ASSOCIATION OF BOMBAY PRESIDENCY".|$|R

5|$|Ralph Edward Flanders (September 28, 1880 – February 19, 1970) was an American <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineer,</b> {{industrialist}} and Republican U.S. Senator {{from the}} state of Vermont. He grew up on subsistence farms in Vermont and Rhode Island, and was an apprentice machinist and draftsman, before training as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineer.</b> He spent five years in New York City as an editor for a machine tool magazine. After moving to Vermont, he managed and then became president of a successful machine tool company. Flanders used his experience as an industrialist to advise state and national commissions in Vermont, New England and Washington, D.C. on public economic policy. He was president of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank for two years before being elected U.S. Senator from Vermont.|$|E

Maunsell incorporated several improvements, notably to the steam circuit and the locomotive's loading gauge, allowing it to operate on routes with height and width restrictions.|$|E

5|$|Maunsell {{was aware}} of the {{reputation}} for poor steaming enjoyed by the class and attempted to address it by the fitting of twin Kylchap blastpipes to No. 860 in 1934. However, the problem was ultimately solved by Oliver Bulleid, Maunsell's replacement as Chief <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Engineer</b> of the Southern in 1938. He fitted larger diameter chimneys and Lemaître multiple jet blastpipes, which effectively transformed their performance. Thereafter the class was highly respected.|$|E
5|$|The SECR Nclass was {{a type of}} 2-6-0 ("mogul") steam {{locomotive}} designed in 1914 by Richard Maunsell for mixed-traffic duties on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR).

5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Engineer,</b> secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be divided between the front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the middle coupled axle for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. The new design was an inevitable compromise between {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the weight down to an acceptable limit.|$|E
5|$|Christian Hedemann (1852–1932) {{counts as}} among the {{earliest}} Danish photographers who emigrated the farthest distance. Though educated in Denmark, he left Copenhagen in 1878 and settled in Hawaii. Primarily occupied as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineer</b> at the Hana Sugar Plantation, Island of Maui, and later as a technical manager at the Honolulu Iron Works, as an avid amateur photographer he helped found the Hawaiian Camera Club (1889–1893). He became an American citizen in 1903 and in 1909 accepted an appointment as Danish Consul. His remarkable photographs of the Hawaiian royal family and native social elites remain {{as some of the}} earliest images available of pre-annexed Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{grouping}} of railway companies in 1923, the LSWR {{became part of}} the Southern Railway (SR) and its publicity department gave the N15locomotives names associated with Arthurian legend; the class hence becoming known as King Arthurs. The Chief <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Engineer</b> (CME) of the newly formed company, Richard Maunsell, modified the Urie locomotives in the light of operational experience and increased the class strength to 74 locomotives. Maunsell and his Chief Draughtsman James Clayton incorporated several improvements, notably to the steam circuit and valve gear.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, {{he moved}} to Springfield, Vermont {{to work as a}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineer</b> for the Fellows Gear Shaper Company. He was already {{friendly}} with James Hartness, the president of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company (J), another company in town. In 1911, Flanders married Hartness' daughter, Helen. Shortly afterwards, Hartness hired Flanders as a manager of the department at J that built the Fay automatic lathe. Flanders redesigned that lathe to achieve higher productivity and accuracy. He became a director in 1912 and president of the company in 1933 after Hartness retired.|$|E
5|$|Rotary fan, {{manual and}} water-powered: For {{purposes}} of air conditioning, the Han Dynasty craftsman and <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineer</b> Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) invented a manually operated rotary fan with seven wheels that measured 3m (10ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the Chinese applied hydraulic power to rotate the fan wheels for air conditioning, while the rotary fan {{became even more}} common during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, as illustrated by German mineralogist and metallurgist Georg Agricola (1494–1555).|$|E
5|$|The SECR Kclass was {{a type of}} 2-6-4 tank {{locomotive}} {{designed in}} 1914 by Richard Maunsell for express passenger duties on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), which operated between London and south-east England. The Southern Railway (SR) K1class was a three-cylinder variant of the Kclass, designed in 1925 to suit a narrower loading gauge. They {{were among the first}} non-Great Western Railway (GWR) types to use and improve upon the basic design principles of power and standardisation established by GWR Chief <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Engineer</b> (CME) George Jackson Churchward. The locomotives were based on the GWR 4300class, improved by the Midland Railway's ideals of simplicity and ease of maintenance.|$|E

5|$|The SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes, collectively {{known as}} Light Pacifics or informally as Spam Cans, are air-smoothed 4-6-2 Pacific steam {{locomotives}} {{designed for the}} Southern Railway by its Chief <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Engineer</b> Oliver Bulleid. Incorporating {{a number of new}} developments in British steam locomotive technology, they were amongst the first British designs to use welding in the construction process, and to use steel fireboxes, which meant that components could be more easily constructed under wartime austerity and post-war economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{waterwheel}} {{appeared in}} Chinese records during the Han. As mentioned by Huan Tan in about 20 AD, {{they were used}} to turn gears that lifted iron trip hammers, and were used in pounding, threshing and polishing grain. However, there is no sufficient evidence for the watermill in China until about the 5th century. The Nanyang Commandery Administrator and <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineer</b> Du Shi (d.38 AD) created a waterwheel-powered reciprocator that worked the bellows for the smelting of iron. Waterwheels were also used to power chain pumps that lifted water to raised irrigation ditches. The chain pump was first mentioned in China by the philosopher Wang Chong in his 1st-century-AD Balanced Discourse.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in India, Calthrop made {{occasional}} trips back to Britain. On one such trip he married Isabel Mary Earle, {{the daughter of the}} Reverend Walter Earle, a friend of his parents. The wedding took place on 19 November 1890 at the Bilton Parish Church, Rugby. They had four children, Everard Earle (Tev, b. 1892), Keith de Suffield (b. 1894), Isabelle Iris (b. 1895), and Betty Marion (b. 1899).
