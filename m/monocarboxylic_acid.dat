40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the uptake mechanism of spinosin (SPI) by the <b>monocarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> transporters (MCTs) in Caco- 2 cells. Methods: The Caco- 2 cells were pretreated with various monocarboxylic acids, and the uptake of spinosin from Caco- 2 cells was measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Key findings: Preloading of various monocarboxylic acids enhanced the uptake of SPI, especially salicylic acid (a substrate of MCTs) had a 23. 4 times increase in SPI uptake, indicating that the <b>monocarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> transporters had an efflux effect on SPI uptake and salicylic acid had a strong inhibition on SPI efflux in Caco- 2 cells. At the same time, the uptake of SPI through Caco- 2 cells was Na+- and temperature-dependent, pretreatment without Na+ significantly increased the uptake of SPI by 1. 85 times and incubated at low temperature (4  °C) SPI uptake increased 20 % than that of 37  °C. Furthermore, SPI was transported mainly via a carrier-mediated transport: [Vmax =  5. 364  μg/mg protein, Km =  657. 0  μg/mL].

The lower molecular weight (C_ -C_) <b>monocarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> dominate in the Antarctic aerosols, suggesting that the organic aerosols mainly orginate from marine organisms through sea-to-air emissions and subsequent atmospheric transport over Antarctica. However, unsaturated <b>monocarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> (C_, C_; 0. 40 - 0. 91 (ngm) ^), which are much more abundant than the saturated ones in marine algae and sea surface microlayers, were detected at relatively low concentrations. Depletion of unsaturated acids in the aerosols can be explained by selective photochemical degradation of the acids in the atmosphere. This is consistent with the relatively abundant presence of C_ 9 monoacid, which is a photooxidation product of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid. The depletion of unsaturated fatty acids is also supported by the abundant presence of C_ 9 α, ω-dicarboxylic acid (azelaic acid), which is a specific counterpart of photooxidation of unsaturated fatty acid containing a double bond predominantly at the C- 9 position. Relative abundance of azelaic acid carbon content in total aerosol carbon content (TC) was found to be positively correlated with solar radiation, suggesting that the photochemical transformation of the Antarctic aerosols is intensified in summer. Mid-chain oxocarboxylic acids (4 -oxooctanoic and 4 -oxononanoic acids; 0. 4 - 1. 0 (ngm) ^) were also detected in the Antarctic aerosols.
