5|$|Dementia with Lewy bodies {{is another}} synucleinopathy {{and it has}} close {{pathological}} similarities with PD, especially with the subset of PD cases with dementia. The relationship between PD and DLB is complex and incompletely understood.

In particular, the issue of sovereignty may bear many similarities between ocean and space colonization; adjustments to social life under harsher circumstances would apply similarly to the ocean and to space; and many technologies may have uses in both environments.|$|R

5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} found on a few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, {{but most of these}} are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been carved with a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they <b>may</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but it may be a palimpsest on an authentic but now illegible text.|$|E
5|$|The Kuiper belt {{is a great}} ring {{of debris}} similar to the {{asteroid}} belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice. It extends between 30 and 50AU from the Sun. Though it is estimated to contain anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets, it is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies. Many of the larger Kuiper belt objects, such as Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus, <b>may</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be dwarf planets with further data. There {{are estimated to be}} over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50km, but the total mass of the Kuiper belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth. Many Kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites, and most have orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|Von Helversen and Heller {{argued that}} none of the old names now {{considered}} synonyms of M.mystacinus could apply to M.alcathoe, because these names all have their type localities in western or central Europe. However, the more recent discovery of M.alcathoe further to the west renders it possible that an older name may be discovered. In addition, Russian researcher Suren Gazaryan has suggested that the name caucasicus Tsytsulina, 2000 (originally proposed for a subspecies of M.mystacinus from the Caucasus) <b>may</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be applicable to M. alcathoe; in that case, the species would be renamed Myotis caucasicus. The species may have remained undetected in Germany for so long because bat researchers did not sample its preferred habitats and would dismiss unusual-looking whiskered bats as being abnormal M.mystacinus or M.brandtii.|$|E

25|$|Amphidromus perversus perversus f. borneensis Pilsbry, 1900, {{is based}} on a stout variant of the interruptus pattern, whitish in {{background}} color, and rather similar to the Javanese subspecies, emaciatus. It was described from South Borneo in the Bandjermassin District (Chicago Natural History Museum 63377), but there are specimens in the Naturalis, Leiden from East Borneo.

25|$|The placebo {{administration}} <b>may</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be {{a useful}} treatment {{in some specific cases}} where recommended drugs cannot be used.

In such cases placebo injections (normal saline, etc.) are of use in providing real pain relief to burn patients if those not in delirium are told they are being given a powerful dose of painkiller.|$|E
