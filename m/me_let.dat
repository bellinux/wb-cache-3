Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with <b>me,</b> <b>let</b> this stream of water prove it," [...] and the stream of water flowed backwards.

But Rabbi Joshua rebuked the walls, telling them not to interfere with scholars engaged in a halachic dispute.

2500|$|The {{catastrophe}} of Stalingrad prompted renewed {{efforts by}} dissident German officers to remove Hitler from power {{while there was}} still time, as they believed, to negotiate an honourable peace settlement. The conspirators were centered on Halder, Beck and Witzleben, but by 1943 all {{had been removed from}} positions of authority. The real movers were now more junior officers: Henning von Tresckow, chief of staff of Army Group Centre, Friedrich Olbricht, Chief of the Armed Forces Replacement Office, and Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, a member of the Replacement Army staff. Their strategy at this time was to persuade the senior field commanders to lead a coup against Hitler. Their initial target was Manstein, now commanding Army Group Don, but he turned Tresckow down at a meeting in March 1943. Several sources say that Rundstedt was also approached, although they do not say specifically who approached him. In any case, he refused to get involved, although both Stülpnagel and Falkenhausen were recruits to the conspiracy. By one account, he complained: [...] "Why always <b>me?</b> <b>Let</b> Manstein and Kluge do it." [...] He told Gerhard Engel, one of Hitler's adjutants, that he was [...] "too old and had had enough." ...|$|E
