METHODS: Six stable renal transplant patients on long-term, oral, twice-daily (Q 12 H) cyclosporin (CsA) therapy received 25 mg <b>mibefradil</b> on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily for 5 or 6 days. At baseline, {{as well as on the}} last day of <b>mibefradil</b> dosing, complete steady-state CsA blood concentration-time profiles were characterized over a dosing interval. RESULTS: <b>Mibefradil</b> led to mean increases in minimum and maximum CsA blood concentrations and area under the curve of CsA by 2. 7 -, 2. 1 -, and 2. 3 -fold, respectively (all significantly different from CsA alone, P < 0. 02). <b>Mibefradil</b> is therefore associated with a clinically relevant increase in CsA blood concentrations.

METHODS: After a 1 -week run-in period on placebo, the subjects (n = 40) were allocated to a placebo or a <b>mibefradil</b> group. Placebo or 50 mg <b>mibefradil</b> was administered once daily in the morning for 1 week. All subjects were investigated at baseline and after 1 week of placebo or <b>mibefradil</b> administration. Standing or recumbent blood pressure and heart rate of subjects in the <b>mibefradil</b> group was decreased (P < 0. 05 or less) compared with that of subjects in the placebo group. RESULTS: Decreased (P < 0. 001) intracellular free Ca 2 + concentration and reduced (P < 0. 001) 3 H-thymidine incorporation in the PBMC were observed in the mibefradil-treated subjects.

Methods. <b>Mibefradil</b> (Ro 40 - 5967, 1 mg/kg body weight intravenously [IV]) was given as a bolus 30 min before anterior descending coronary artery ligation, followed by 2 mg/kg per h IV during 20 min of ischemia and 25 min of reperfusion in open chest pigs. In a second group, <b>mibefradil</b> was given in a dose twice as high. A third group received verapamil (0. 3 mg/kg IV), followed by an infusion of 0. 6 mg/kg per h. Results.

Resting-state dependent block (or initial block) of barium currents (IBa) through class A Ca 2 + channels was concentration dependent with an IC 50 value of 208 ± 23 [*]μM. <b>Mibefradil</b> (50 [*]μM) {{did not significantly}} affect the midpoint voltage of the steady-state inactivation curve suggesting that inactivation does not promote Ca 2 + channel block.

Background. The use of calcium channel blocking agents in chronic HF has been disappointing. Most studies have shown that these drugs have either no or even detrimental effects {{due in part to the}} negative inotropic effects they induce. <b>Mibefradil</b> is a calcium channel blocker that selectively blocks T channels and displays moderately negative inotropic properties only at high doses. Because T channels are upregulated in the hypertrophied heart and could mediate hypertrophic signals and increase arrhythmogenicity, blockade of these channels might be beneficial in chronic HF. Methods. Rats were subjected to coronary artery ligation and 9 months of treatment with <b>mibefradil</b> (15 mg/kg body weight per day) or cilazapril (10 mg/kg per day) or no treatment. Survival and systolic blood pressure were assessed over the 9 -month treatment period, after which cardiac hemodynamic variables and structure were determined. Results. <b>Mibefradil</b> increased survival rate to the same extent as cilazapril (71 % for <b>mibefradil</b> vs. 75 % for cilazapril and 44 % for no treatment). <b>Mibefradil</b> decreased systolic blood pressure, although to a lesser extent than cilazapril. Both treatments decreased left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and central venous pressures, without any change in the first derivative of LV pressure over time or heart rate. <b>Mibefradil</b> decreased LV weight (although less than cilazapril) without affecting right ventricular weight.

The LVA currents were small and preferentially blocked by amiloride and low doses of nickel. Most of the HVA Ca 2 + current flowed through N-type Ca 2 + channels, while L-, and P/Q-type channels represented a smaller fraction. <b>Mibefradil</b> caused a rapid and reversible dose-dependent block of inward Ca 2 + channel currents. Inhibition was nearly complete at 10 microM, suggesting <b>mibefradil</b> blockade of all subclasses of Ca 2 + channels. The IC 50 was approximately 1. 4 microM on currents measured at 0 mV, from a holding potential of - 90 mV. Inhibition of LVA Ca 2 + current occurred over the same contraction range.

Restoration of the proliferative response in mibefradil- or nifedipine-treated cells was investigated by addition of exogenous interleukin- 2. Interleukin- 2 -receptor expression in the cells was monitored by using anti-activated T-cell antigen (Tac) antibody, and the interleukin- 2 production in the cell supernatants of the cultures was determined by an enzyme-amplified sensitive immunoassay. <b>Mibefradil</b> and nifedipine concentration-dependently reduced the cell number and the [3 H]thymidine incorporation or the de novo DNA synthesis in control and concanavalin A-stimulated human PBMCs. <b>Mibefradil</b> exhibited a more pronounced inhibition of the proliferation of human PBMCs than did nifedipine. The inhibitory effect of <b>mibefradil</b> or nifedipine on DNA synthesis was dependent on the timing of treatment with the drugs. The inhibitory effect of <b>mibefradil</b> or nifedipine on the lymphoproliferative response was nearly abolished if the drugs were added 20 h after cell stimulation. A markedly reduced inhibitory effect was found when <b>mibefradil</b> or nifedipine was added 1 - 7 h after cell stimulation. However, regardless of time of addition, TMB- 8 caused a persistent inhibition of the proliferation of human PBMCs. The inhibitory effect of <b>mibefradil</b> or nifedipine on the proliferation of human PBMCs is nearly abolished by addition of the calcium channel activator Bay K 8644. The proliferative response of mibefradil- or nifedipine-treated cells is restored by addition of exogenous interleukin- 2. The normal expression of interleukin- 2 receptors was preserved, whereas the interleukin- 2 production was blocked in the presence of <b>mibefradil</b> or nifedipine. Our data show that <b>mibefradil</b> has a more pronounced inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human PBMCs than nifedipine and that this inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis is dependent on the timing of treatment with both drugs. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{angiographic}} and clinical benefits of the calcium T-channel blocker, <b>mibefradil,</b> in the coronary slow flow phenomenon (CSFP). Background: The CSFP is characterized by delayed vessel opacification on angiography (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction [TIMI]- 2 flow) in the absence of obstructive epicardial coronary disease and is often associated with recurrent chest pain. Methods: A total of 10 CSFP patients (46 ± 9 years) underwent angiography before and 30 min after 50 mg mibefradil; off-line blinded analysis of angiographic data included comparisons of epicardial vessel diameter, TIMI flow grade and TIMI frame count. We also performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study to examine the long-term efficacy of <b>mibefradil</b> 100 mg/day on the frequency of total angina, prolonged angina (i. e., persisting > 20 min) episodes, and sublingual nitrate consumption, during consecutive one-month treatment periods in 20 patients (age 51 ± 12 years) with the CSFP. Results: Without changing epicardial vessel diameter or rate-pressure product, <b>mibefradil</b> reduced the number of vessels exhibiting TIMI- 2 flow from 18 to 5; furthermore, <b>mibefradil</b> significantly improved the TIMI frame count only in those vessels exhibiting TIMI- 2 flow (28 ± 18 %, p < 0. 005). Compared with placebo, <b>mibefradil</b> significantly reduced total angina frequency by 56 % (p < 0. 001), prolonged episodes of angina by 74 % (p < 0. 001), and sublingual nitrate consumption by 59 % (p < 0. 01); furthermore, <b>mibefradil</b> improved physical quality of life as assessed by the Health Outcome Study Short Form- 36.

40|$|Objective: This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the acute effects of intravenous <b>mibefradil</b> on the electrophysiologic characteristics of the human heart. Methods: Seventy-one patients referred for routine electrophysiologic testing were randomized to receive one of three intravenous treatments: placebo n = 23, 15 mg <b>mibefradil</b> in 15 min followed by 25 mg in 60 min (group 1, n = 24), or 35 mg <b>mibefradil</b> in 15 min followed by 45 mg in 60 min (group 2, n = 24). Electrophysiologic evaluations were performed prior to study drug administration and 30 min after the start of the infusion. Plasma samples were obtained {{at the start of the}} infusion and after 15, 75, and 105 min. Results: Sinus node recovery time decreased significantly in Group 1 patients (- 103 ms). Corrected sinus node recovery time in group 2 patients was 68. 7 ms (P = 0. 053). Compared to placebo, <b>mibefradil</b> produced mild but significant slowing of conduction in group 2 patients as manifested by an increase in the AH interval of 6. 7 ms. Atrioventricular (AV) nodal refractoriness was increased, as indicated by a prolongation of the Wenckebach point in patients in both group 1 (32. 1 ms) and group 2 (32. 5 ms), compared to placebo. All adverse events were classified as mild to moderate and only one event (vasovagal attack) was considered to be treatment related. Conclusions: At plasma levels close to those found after chronic oral administration of 50 and 100 mg <b>mibefradil,</b> the higher dose produced an increase in corrected sinus node recovery time. <b>Mibefradil</b> also produced small but significant effects on AV nodal conduction and increased AV nodal refractoriness. <b>Mibefradil</b> had no effect on any other electrophysiologic parameter and was well tolerated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Mibefradil and {{amlodipine}} are calcium antagonists {{with different}} channel selectivities. <b>Mibefradil</b> blocks both L- and T-type calcium channels; {{although in the}} usual pharmacological doses, it predominantly blocks the T-type channels. In contrast, amlodipine selectively blocks L-type channels. The goal {{of the present study}} was to assess whether this differential selectivity would result in different effects on end-organ damage in experimental hypertension. For this purpose, deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) –salt hypertensive rats were treated either with equipotent doses of <b>mibefradil</b> or amlodipine (30 mg z kg 21 z d 21 as food admix). Despite the fact that both drugs decreased systolic arterial pressure to the same extent (14065 mm Hg in the <b>mibefradil</b> group and 14463 mm Hg in the amlodipine group versus 22565 mm Hg in the untreated-DOCA group), only <b>mibefradil</b> decreased proteinuria (35. 566. 5 versus 103. 3614. 1 mg/ 24 h in untreated DOCA-salt animals) and prevented glomerular lesions. Both drugs, however, prevented the occurrence of vascular renal lesions. To elucidate the mechanism responsible for this difference, we evaluated in an additional series of experiments the effects of <b>mibefradil</b> and amlodipine on plasma and renal renin concentrations, as well as the effects of the addition of enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, given on top of both drugs on proteinuria.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Numerous {{recent studies}} suggest that {{abnormal}} intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) is a common defect in diabetic animal models and patients. Abnormal calcium handling is an important mechanism in the defective pancreatic &# 946;-cell function in type 2 diabetes. T-type Ca 2 + channel antagonists lower blood glucose in type 2 diabetes, but the mechanism remains unknown. METHODS: We examined {{the effect of the}} Ca 2 + channel antagonist <b>mibefradil</b> on blood glucose in male db/db mice and phenotypically normal heterozygous mice by intraperitoneal injection. RESULTS: <b>Mibefradil</b> (15 mg/kg, i. p., b. i. d.) caused a profound reduction of fasting blood glucose from 430. 92 &# 177; 20. 46 mg/dl to 285. 20 &# 177; 5. 74 mg/dl in three days. The hypoglycemic effect of <b>mibefradil</b> was reproduced by NNC 55 - 0396, a compound structurally similar to <b>mibefradil</b> but more selective for T-type Ca 2 + channels, but not by the specific L-type Ca 2 + channel blocker nicardipine. <b>Mibefradil</b> did not show such hypoglycemic effects in heterozygous animals. In addition, triglycerides, basal insulin and food intake were significantly decreased by <b>mibefradil</b> treatment in the db/db mice but not in the controls. Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining showed a significantly increased expression of T-type Ca 2 + channel &# 945;-subunits Cav 3. 1 and Cav 3. 2 in liver and brain tissues from db/db mice compared to those from heterozygous animals.

These studies aimed {{to compare the}} effects of nifedipine and the putative T-channel blocker, <b>mibefradil,</b> on arteriolar myogenic responsiveness and intracellular Ca 2 + (Ca 2 +i). First order cremaster muscle arterioles (1 A) were isolated from rats, cannulated, pressurized to 70 [*]mmHg {{in the absence of}} intraluminal flow, and mechanical responses studied by video microscopy. The Ca 2 +i was measured using fluorescence imaging of Fura 2 loaded arterioles. Both nifedipine and <b>mibefradil</b> showed dose-dependent inhibition of spontaneous myogenic tone (at 70 [*]mmHg; pEC 50 7. 04 ± 0. 17 vs 6. 65 ± 0. 20 respectively, n= 6 for both, n. s.) and KCl-induced vasoconstriction (at 70 [*]mmHg; pEC 50 6. 93 ± 0. 38 vs 6. 45 ± 0. 27 respectively, n= 6 for both, n. s.). In arterioles maintained at 50 [*]mmHg, nifedipine (10 − 7 and 10 − 5 [*]M) caused a concentration dependent reduction in Ca 2 +i, however, <b>mibefradil</b> (10 − 7 and 10 − 5 [*]M) had no effect. Furthermore nifedipine significantly attenuated the increase in Ca 2 +i associated with an acute pressure step (50 – 120 [*]mmHg) whereas <b>mibefradil</b> was considerably less effective. <b>Mibefradil</b> (10 − 7 [*]M) significantly attenuated contractile responses to 60 [*]mM KCl without altering the KCl-induced increase in Ca 2 +i, in contrast to nifedipine (10 − 7 [*]M) which reduced both Ca 2 +i and contraction. Membrane potential of arterioles with spontaneous myogenic tone (70 [*]mmHg) was − 41. 5 ± 1. 0 [*]mV. Nifedipine (10 − 7 or 10 − 5 [*]M) had no effect on membrane potential, however <b>mibefradil</b> (10 − 5 [*]M) caused significant depolarization. In summary, both <b>mibefradil</b> and nifedipine inhibit arteriolar spontaneous tone and acute myogenic reactivity. While there may be overlap in the mechanisms by which these agents inhibit tone, differences in effects on membrane potential and intracellular Ca 2 + levels suggest <b>mibefradil</b> exhibits actions other than blockade of Ca 2 + entry in skeletal muscle arterioles...|$|E
40|$|Voltage-operated {{calcium channel}} (VOCC) antagonists are {{effective}} antihypertensive and antianginal agents {{but they also}} depress myocardial contractility. We compared four L-type calcium channel antagonists, felodipine, nifedipine, amlodipine and verapamil and a relatively T-type selective calcium channel antagonist, <b>mibefradil,</b> on human and rat isolated tissue assays to determine their functional vascular to cardiac tissue selectivity (V/C) ratio. The V/C ratio was calculated as {{the ratio of the}} IC 50 value of the antagonist that reduced (by 50 %) submaximally contracted (K+ 62 [*]mM) human small arteries from the aortic vasa vasorum (vascular, V) mounted in a myograph and the IC 50 value of the antagonist that reduced (−) -isoprenaline (6 [*]nM) submaximally stimulated human right atrial trabeculae muscle (cardiac, C) mounted in organ chambers. The average pIC 50 values (−log IC 50 [*]M) for the human vascular preparations were felodipine 8. 30, nifedipine 7. 78, amlodipine 6. 64, verapamil 6. 26 and <b>mibefradil</b> 6. 22. The average pIC 50 values for the cardiac muscle were felodipine 7. 21, nifedipine 6. 95, verapamil 6. 91, amlodipine 5. 94, and <b>mibefradil</b> 4. 61. The V/C ratio calculated as antilog [pIC 50 V-pIC 50 C] is thus <b>mibefradil</b> 41, felodipine 12, nifedipine 7, amlodipine 5 and verapamil 0. 2. In rat small mesenteric arteries the pIC 50 values for the five drugs were similar to the values for human vasa vasorum arteries contracted by K+ 62 [*]mM. However for methoxamine (10 [*]μM) contraction in the rat arteries the pIC 50 values were lower for felodipine 7. 24 and nifedipine 6. 23, but similar for verapamil 6. 13, amlodipine 6. 28 and <b>mibefradil</b> 5. 91. In conclusion, in the human tissue assays, the putative T-channel antagonist <b>mibefradil</b> shows the highest vascular to cardiac selectivity ratio; some 3 fold higher than the dihydropyridine, felodipine, and some 200 fold more vascular selective than the phenylalkylamine, verapamil. This favourable vascular to cardiac selectivity for <b>mibefradil,</b> from a new chemical class of VOCC antagonist, may be explained by its putative T-channel selectivity...|$|E
40|$|This study tested whether <b>mibefradil</b> exerts a {{stronger}} inhibitory effect than verapamil on sympathetic neurotransmitter release provoked by electrical field stimulation. Tail arteries (diameter 620 +/- 9 microm) {{were obtained from}} male Wistar rats. Ring segments of 2 mm length were mounted in an isometric wire myograph. After an appropriate period of equilibration and a priming procedure the vessels were either subjected to electrical field stimulation (EFS; frequency 0. 25 - 4 Hz for 30 s) or a concentration-response curve was generated with either noradrenaline (concentration range 0. 03 - 3 microM) or ATP (concentration 0. 3 mM) which served as baseline parameters. EFS-induced contractions were stable and reproducible and were blocked by tetrodotoxin (1 microM), guanethidine (3 microM), and the combination of suramin (0. 5 mM) and prazosin (3 microM). EFS-induced contractions (1 Hz) were almost completely inhibited by 10 microM <b>mibefradil</b> (97 %) but only partly by 10 microM verapamil (73 %). Log IC 50 values were - 5. 6 for <b>mibefradil</b> and - 6. 6 for verapamil. Calcium antagonists were equipotent in inhibiting noradrenaline (maximum inhibition by <b>mibefradil</b> and verapamil by 70 % and 75 %, respectively; log IC 50 : - 6. 5 and - 6. 7, respectively) and ATP-mediated contractions (maximum inhibition by <b>mibefradil</b> and verapamil by 92 % and 97 %, respectively; log IC 50 : - 6. 5 and - 7. 0, respectively). Consequently <b>mibefradil</b> displays an additional effect on contractions provoked by EFS-induced sympathetic noradrenaline release which cannot be explained by L-type calcium channel blockade. Probably this effect of <b>mibefradil</b> is mediated by the blockade of prejunctional N-type calcium channels, thereby inhibiting sympathetic noradrenaline release. Since activation of the sympathetic nervous system in hypertension is both common and undesirable, a calcium antagonist displaying both L- and N-type calcium channel blocking activities, would have major advantages over calcium antagonists lacking N-type calcium channel blocking activitie...|$|E
40|$|Cyclosporin A {{reduces the}} mitotic {{activity}} of allosensitized lymphocytes, but fails to limit emigration of these cells into the donor organ. However, the modulation of both lymphocyte proliferation and infiltration are desirable characteristics of immunosuppressive therapy. The calcium-channel blocker, verapamil, {{has recently been}} shown to effectively prevent the transmigration of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells through allogeneic endothelium. <b>Mibefradil</b> (Ro 40 - 5967) represents {{a new generation of}} calcium antagonists with high potency and long-term activity. To evaluate the immunosuppressive potential of this drug, the influence of <b>mibefradil</b> on lymphocyte adhesion to, horizontal locomotion along, and penetration through allogeneic endothelium (HUVEC) was performed. When lymphocytes were prestimulated for 24 hr with <b>mibefradil,</b> adhesion and penetration were dose-dependently reduced. The adhesion ID 50 values were 3. 4 microM (CD 4 + T cells) versus 9. 2 microM (CD 8 + T cells) and 2. 1 microM (CD 4 + T cells) versus 3. 9 microM (CD 8 + T cells) with regard to penetration. <b>Mibefradil</b> also effectively blocked horizontal locomotion. Specific down-regulation of T-cell binding to the P-selection receptor (ID 50 : CD 4 + T cells, 0. 8 microM: CD 8 + T cells, 1. 2 microM) and to the intracellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) receptor (ID 50 : CD 4 + T cells, 1. 9 microM; CD 8 + T cells, 1. 5 microM) by <b>mibefradil</b> seems to be responsible for the decreased adhesion and penetration rates.
