Our calculations of the phonon-phonon anharmonicities confirm that the cubic coupling between modes, shown in earlier work to cause a quasi-static change in the apical O - Cu distance and a buckling of the CuO_ 2 planes, is the leading contribution at moderate pump strengths. At higher pump strengths (∼ 10 MV/cm) the previously neglected quartic couplings become relevant and produce an additional shearing of the CuO_ 2 planes.

Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard to diagnose SDB, is a highly resource-intensive test, confined to the sleep laboratory. Aim: To combine the blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2) characterization and cardiac <b>modulation,</b> quantified <b>by</b> <b>pulse</b> rate variability (PRV), to identify children with SDB using the Phone Oximeter, a device integrating a pulse oximeter with a smartphone.

40|$|The modulational {{instability}} {{that occurs}} during {{the interaction of}} a long laser pulse and its own wakefield in an underdense plasma has been studied experimentally and theoretically. Recent experiments using laser pulses that are several times longer than the wakefield period have yielded transmission spectra that exhibit a series of secondary peaks flanking the main laser peak. These peaks are too closely spaced {{to be the result}} of Raman instabilities; their origin was found to be photon acceleration of the laser's photons in the wakefield instead. In the experiments described in this paper, a laser pulse of 50 – 200 fs containing 300 – 600 mJ was focused on the edge of a helium gas jet on a 25 µm focal spot. The observed transmission spectra show evidence of both ionization blueshift and <b>modulation</b> <b>by</b> the <b>pulse's</b> wakefield. The transmission spectra have also been modelled using a dedicated photon-kinetic numerical code. The modelling has revealed a direct correlation between the spectral modulations and the amplitude of the excited wakefield. By comparing the measured and simulating spectra, the origin of various spectral characteristics has been explained in terms of photon acceleration. The feasibility of using this effect as a wakefield diagnostic will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{well-known}} half-bridge {{square wave}} voltage generator {{will be used to}} supply energy to a gas discharge lamp through a ballast circuit comprising an inductor L in series with a resistor R, representing the losses of the circuit. Parallel to the lamp, which is represented by a conductance G, a capacitor C has been connected, for lamp ignition and/or preheating of the electrodes of fluorescent lamps. This LRCG circuit has been used as the model for an exact analysis that presents closed expressions for the lamp current and voltage and the supply current as a function of time for one half period of the steady-state operation. Integration provides the power loss in R and the lamp power in G giving easy access to the rms values of lamp current and voltage. The use of the conductance to represent the lamp electrically will also allow calculation of the power control. For this purpose an equation of G {{as a function of the}} lamp power is available.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{in-depth}} {{study of the}} High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) GX 301 - 2 during its pre-periastron flare {{using data from the}} XMM-Newton satellite. The energy spectrum shows a power law continuum absorbed by a large equivalent hydrogen column on the order of 10 (exp 24) / sq cm and a prominent Fe K-alpha fluorescent emission line. Besides the Fe K-alpha line, evidence for Fe K-Beta, Ni K-alpha, Ni K-Beta, S K-alpha, Ar K-alpha, Ca K-alpha, and Cr K-alpha fluorescent lines is found. The observed line strengths are consistent with fluorescence in a cold absorber. This {{is the first time that}} Cr K-alpha is seen in emission in the X-ray spectrum of a HMXB. In addition to the <b>modulation</b> <b>by</b> the strong <b>pulse</b> period of approx 685 sec the source is highly variable and shows different states of activity. We perform time-resolved as well as pulse-to-pulse resolved spectroscopy to investigate differences between these states of activity. We find that fluorescent line fluxes are strongly variable and generally follow the overall flux. The N-H value is variable by a factor of 2, but not correlated to continuum normalization. We find an interval of low flux in the light curve in which the pulsations cease almost completely, without any indication of an increasing absorption column. We investigate this dip in detail and argue that it is most likely that during the dip the accretion ceased and the afterglow of the fluorescent iron accounted for the main portion of the X-ray flux. A similar dip was found earlier in RXTE data, and we compare our findings to these results...|$|R

40|$|Purpose/Introduction: As a {{ubiquitous}} {{component of}} all animal tissues, cholesterol has vital structural roles [1, 2]. In this work, {{the detection of}} cholesterol is reported {{for the first time}} noninvasively in human calf adipose tissue by 13 C MRS at 7 T, with the J-refocused 1 H PRESS localized DEPT sequence combined with broadband decoupling. Subjects and Methods: A J-refocused 1 H PRESS localized DEPT sequence was shown in Fig. 1. A 90 o RF pulse was inserted {{in the middle of the}} double echo PRESS localization part, which reverses the direction of J-coupling evolution at this point. While J-refocused 1 H PRESS substitutes the first 90 o pulse of a conventional DEPT experiment, the residual part of the DEPT sequence remains unchanged and was implemented subsequently. The effectiveness of the suppression of J-modulation was investigated by comparing glutamate spectra obtained with and without J-refocusing pulse at different TE times. To detect lipids in the calf adipose tissue, the sequence was applied on a 7 T Philips Achiena MRI system using a quadrature dual-tuned 13 C/ 1 H partial volume extremity coil. Results: As demonstrated from the glutamate phantom, an effective suppression of J <b>modulation</b> <b>by</b> the J-refocusing <b>pulse</b> is achieved when TE is less than 80 ms as shown in Fig. 2. Natural abundance 13 C MR spectra acquired with the proposed sequence from the left calf of two healthy subjects are shown in Fig. 3. Eight well established peak assignments are labelled in green with their chemical shifts marked in black which are in agreement with literature values (Table 1).
