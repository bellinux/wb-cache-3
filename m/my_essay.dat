She has stated that her parents [...] "raised [...] Jewish {{as much as they}} could," [...] although religion was suppressed in the Soviet Union. On her second day in Los Angeles, Kunis was enrolled at Rosewood Elementary School, not knowing a word of English. She later recalled: [...] "I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. It was because I cried every day. I didn't understand the culture. I didn't understand the people. I didn't understand the language. My first sentence of <b>my</b> <b>essay</b> to get into college was like, 'Imagine being blind and deaf at age seven.' And that's kind of what it felt like moving to the States." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a July 19, 2006 {{comment to}} his July 17 article Professor James K. Galbraith writes: [...] "For the PREP data, {{the issue of}} whether we are seeing 'cyberfraud' or a more {{traditional}} kind is a red herring, in my view. I did not use the term 'cyberfraud' in <b>my</b> <b>essay.</b> In principle, the anomalies observed could be generated electronically, or manually. Or, to be complete, they could have innocent explanations; however so far these have not been provided." [...] Professor Galbraith holds the Lloyd M Bentsen Jr chair of government/business relations at the Lyndon B Johnson school of public affairs, the University of Texas.|$|E
2500|$|The revised 1870 {{second edition}} of 1,500 copies {{attracted}} more attention, being quickly followed by further revised editions with larger print runs {{as the book}} became a prominent part of the optimistic, nationalist, anticlerical [...] "culture of progress" [...] in Otto von Bismarck's new German Empire. The similarity of early vertebrate embryos became common knowledge, and the illustrations were praised by experts such as Michael Foster of the University of Cambridge. In the introduction to his 1871 The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, Darwin gave particular praise to Haeckel, writing that if Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte [...] "had appeared before <b>my</b> <b>essay</b> had been written, I should probably never have completed it." [...] The first chapter included an illustration: [...] "As some of my readers may never have seen a drawing of an embryo, I have given one of man and another of a dog, {{at about the same}} early stage of development, carefully copied from two works of undoubted accuracy" [...] with a footnote citing the sources and noting that [...] "Häckel has also given analogous drawings in his Schöpfungsgeschichte." [...] The fifth edition of Haeckel's book appeared in 1874, with its frontispiece a heroic portrait of Haeckel himself, replacing the previous controversial image of the heads of apes and humans.|$|E

60|$|I put {{the book}} down and turned away, {{apparently}} uninfluenced by it. Indeed, I remained, if anything, more {{loyal to the}} grand manner of Hawthorne, but my love of realism was growing.

60|$|I had {{intended}} {{adding to the}} present volumes an essay on {{the expression of the}} various emotions by man and the lower animals. My attention was called to this subject many years ago by Sir Charles Bell's admirable work. This illustrious anatomist maintains that man is endowed with certain muscles solely for the sake of expressing his emotions. As this view is obviously opposed to the belief that man is descended from some other and lower form, it was necessary for me to consider it. I likewise wished to ascertain how far the emotions are expressed in the same manner by the different races of man.

When first she left her peasant life, and resided with the elegant and cultivated Evadne, the only accomplishment she brought to any perfection was that of painting, for which she had a taste almost amounting to genius. This had occupied her in her lonely cottage, when she quitted her Greek friend's protection. Her pallet and easel were now thrown aside; did she try to paint, thronging recollections made her hand tremble, her eyes fill with tears. With this occupation she gave up almost every other; and her mind preyed upon itself almost to madness.|$|E
