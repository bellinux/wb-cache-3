40|$|Abstract—Automation and <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> <b>technologies</b> for {{in-house}} logistics {{tasks are}} widely applied. Generally, modules of the automation systems are planned, programmed, and commissioned according to specific requirements. Constantly changing conditions and flexible demands of production processes pose new {{challenges for the}} dynamic composition of various system components. Cyber-physical systems (CSP) propose an approach for storing and processing additional data of a physical system in a virtual representation. The paper illustrates an agent-based architecture for dynamic and modular control of single <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> equipment within a logistics system. Specifically, the paper addresses the issue of modeling and operating physical interfaces based on multi-agent communication and points out the benefits of this approach. The evaluation of the approach is done by implementing it into real industrial <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> equipment and gives a valuable insight into the prospects and challenges of cyber-physical concepts.

40|$|The common view is {{that major}} {{transitions}} come about through breakthroughs of technological discontinuities. This article proposes gradual and stepwise reconfiguration as an alternative transition pathway. In it, new elements are adopted in the existing socio-technical regime to help solve particular problems. But as more is learned and circumstances change, these elements may trigger further changes in technology, user practice, infrastructure, and policies, eventually altering the basic architecture of the regime. These notions are integrated in a multi-level perspective on transitions and system changes. The resulting reconfiguration perspective is illustrated with a historical case study of the transition from traditional factories to mass production in America (1850 – 1930). The analysis shows that mass production was the last step in a much longer reconfiguration process involving cumulative changes in machine tools, building <b>materials,</b> <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>technologies,</b> power generation, and power-distribution technologies. The reconfiguration perspective has wider relevance for other systems that function through the interplay of multiple technologies, e. g., agriculture, retailing, and hospitals.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{cross-docking}} {{has emerged as}} an important <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> <b>technology</b> in transportation. A variation of the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), the Vehicle Routing Problem with Cross-Docking (VRPCD) arises {{in a number of}} logistics planning contexts. This paper addresses the VRPCD, where a set of homogeneous vehicles are used to transport products from the suppliers to the corresponding customers via a cross-dock. The products can be consolidated at the cross-dock but cannot be stored for very long because the cross-dock does not have long-term inventory-holding capabilities. The objective of the VRPCD is to minimize the total traveled distance while respecting time window constraints at the nodes and a time horizon for the whole transportation operation. In this paper, a mixed integer programming formulation for the VRPCD is proposed. A tabu search heuristic is embedded within an adaptive memory procedure to solve the problem. The proposed algorithm is implemented and tested on data sets provided by the Danish consultancy Transvision, and involving up to 200 pairs of nodes. Experimental results show that this algorithm can produce high quality solutions (less than 5 % away from optimal solution values) within very short computational time...|$|R

40|$|Automated vehicle storage/retrieval system (AVS/RS) {{technology}} is relatively new. It {{has been applied}} successfully in several European facilities in 1990 s. AVS/RS is a flexible system that is {{a viable alternative to}} automated storage/retrieval systems (AS/RS), a traditional <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> <b>technology</b> that has been in existence for more than fifty years. There are very few papers in the literature that focus on the use of analytical models for estimating performance measures of AVS/RS. In this thesis, queuing network theory is used to model an AVS/BS system to analyze its performance. The manufacturing system performance analyzer (MPA) is an open queuing network (OQN) analyzer based on the parametric decomposition method. This thesis models the AVS/RS and uses MPA to analyze the performance of an AVS/RS configuration. A simulation model based on discrete events is also generated by Promodel to allow comparison of MPA results with those of simulation. A web interface for conceptualizing AVS/RS and AS/RS designs is presented in this thesis. This on-line tool provides a convenient and friendly interface between warehouse designers and time analytical model tool. Pour case studies of algorithms embedded in the web interface are presented in the thesis. An initial warehouse design is first analyzed by MPA. After this, several improvements of this initial design are evaluated. Experimental results are provided to show that the OQN methodology can he applied effectively to analyze an AVS/RS when vehicle utilization is between 60 % and 85 %. MPA is a better choice than simulation to quickly evaluate alterilate configuration of the AVS/RS. Additionally, two more experiments are conducted to compare MPA with another AVS/RS system performance analyzer.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we study}} the {{performance}} evaluation of two automated warehouse <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> (MH) <b>technologies</b> - automated storage/retrieval system (AS/RS) and autonomous vehicle storage/retrieval system (AVS/RS). AS/RS {{is a traditional}} automated warehouse MH technology and {{has been used for}} more than five decades. AVS/RS is a relatively new automated warehouse MH technology and an alternative to AS/RS. There are two possible configurations of AVS/RS: AVS/RS with tier-captive vehicles and AVS/RS with tier-to-tier vehicles. We model the AS/RS and both configurations of the AVS/RS as queueing networks. We analyze and develop approximate algorithms for these network models and use them to estimate performance of the two automated warehouse MH technologies. Chapter 2 contains two parts. The first part is a brief review of existing papers about AS/RS and AVS/RS. The second part is a methodological review of queueing network theory, which serves as a building block for our study. In Chapter 3, we model AS/RSs and AVS/RSs with tier-captive vehicles as open queueing networks (OQNs). We show how to analyze OQNs and estimate related performance measures. We then apply an existing OQN analyzer to compare the two MH technologies and answer various design questions. In Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, we present some efficient algorithms to solve SOQN. We show how to model AVS/RSs with tier-to-tier vehicles as SOQNs and evaluate performance of these designs in Chapter 6. AVS/RS is a relatively new automated warehouse design technology. Hence, there are few efficient analytical tools to evaluate performance measures of this technology. We developed some efficient algorithms based on SOQN to quickly and effectively evaluate performance of AVS/RS. Additionally, we present a tool that helps a warehouse designer during the concepting stage to determine the type of MH technology to use, analyze numerous alternate warehouse configurations and select one of these for final implementation...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{automotive}} industry {{accounts for a}} large part of the European economic structure. Due to both economical and environmental impacts, the industry has undergone substantial changes and companies have to increase their efficiency to stay competitive. An improvement-area, which can be directly influenced by the company is the internal <b>material</b> <b>handling.</b> A new <b>technology</b> that potentially supports the internal <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> process is the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, which is perceived as a fruitful successor of the common barcoding technology. Even though the RFID technology shows multiple benefits over the barcoding technology, many companies are still reluctant to the application of the new method. The authors therefore strive to provide a deeper understanding of the following two research questions:   RQ 1 : To what extent and how is RFID currently applied in the internal <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> process in the investigated automotive companies? RQ 2 : For what reasons did the investigated automotive companies decide to apply or not apply RFID technologies to support their internal <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> process?   Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to show through a multiple case study to what extent and how RFID technology is currently applied to support the internal <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> process in a number of companies in the automotive sector, both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers. Thereupon the main reasons for or against the application of RFID in these companies are examined.   Method: This thesis adopts a positivistic perspective and a deductive approach. It is designed as a qualitative multiple case study carried out in four different companies with five different plants in the {{automotive industry}}. Empirical data was gathered through interviews. The analysis is based on primary as well as secondary data.   Conclusions: Throughout the course of the study it became apparent that the RFID technology is on the radar of all investigated companies. Only Scania Zwolle, Volvo Skövde and Bosch Homburg apply the technology and see concrete benefits in the usage of RFID above barcoding. The extent of application here differs from a large scale to a small scale. The three companies name benefits such as an improved automatic tracking & tracing system with improved real-time data quality and a reduction in costs, which is mainly achieved through a reduction of manual labour. Additionally they face benefits, which are business-specific such as the possibility for automatic alerts throughout the internal <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> process at Scania Zwolle, the need for a ‘silent’ successor over barcoding at Volvo Skövde and a supporting tool for their lean management program at Bosch Homburg. VDL Nedcar Born and Scania Oskarshamn in turn name concrete reasons for not applying the technology. VDL Nedcar Born is undergoing substantial changes in their production facility which currently has priority and Scania Oskarshamn does not see benefits that outweigh the high costs for the RFID technology...|$|R
