40|$|AbstractThis study's {{objective}} was to design, develop and construct a <b>monitoring</b> <b>table</b> tennis net to minimize mistakes in adjusting the net and achieve a constant and highly precise net height, net tension as well as detection of ball-net contacts during service (so called: let). Furthermore, it should improve and expand the standards for net adjustment which are unclear and not exactly reproducible at the moment. The monitoring device consists of a grey consoling housing, a custom-made force sensor, an electronic circuit, two graphical user interfaces, two height sensors, a let sensor, an electronic circuit and two graphical user interfaces. The proposed device provides a way for measuring net height and tension to ensure similar playing conditions (worldwide) {{and can be used}} for the detection of ball-net impacts during service...|$|E
30|$|Vehicles become {{insensitive}} in {{signal detection}} as CS threshold grows and such insensitivity helps to improve PDR if CS threshold {{is less than}} a crossover point. Recall that a vehicle records whether or not each slot is idle in its <b>monitoring</b> <b>table</b> and selects its transmission slot among all the idle slots recorded in the table. Obviously, the insensitivity increases with CS threshold; thus, the number of idle slots recorded in the table increases with a CS threshold. This implies that a probability that more than two vehicles selects the same transmission slot decreases as a CS threshold rises. In contrast, the insensitivity in signal detection contributes to PDR degradation if CS threshold passes the crossover point. In most wireless communication systems, receivers first detect a signal of a packet, then decode the packet [21]. In the regime whereby CS threshold is too high, receivers fail to detect a large fraction of packets. In other words, the detection failure is a dominant factor that influences PDR in this regime; thus, PDR degrades with CS threshold.|$|E

3000|$|Methods for radiotracer {{analyses}} were developed on an API 5000 LC-MS/MS system (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA), consisting of Shimadzu LC (Columbia, MD, USA) interfaced via electrospray with triple quadrupole MS/MS operated in positive ionization mode. The technique principally involves quantitative measurement of two ions that differ by two mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) units, {{one for the}} 11 C-labeled species, denoted [11 C]species, and another for the carrier, denoted [M[*]+[*] 1]carrier. [M[*]+[*] 1]carrier ions are generated from isotopologues having predominantly one carbon- 13 atom or another heavy stable isotope (2 H, 15 N, or 17 O) of very low abundance. Thus, for example, a solution of PBR 28 was infused into the MS/MS, and, upon recording the product ions, compound-dependent and gas parameters were optimized for the m/z 349 [M[*]+[*]H]+[*]→[*] 121 transition for monitoring [12 C]species. An acquisition method for [11 C]PBR 28 was set up using the same instrument parameters and with the multiple-reaction <b>monitoring</b> <b>table</b> being edited to perform transitions, m/z 348 [*]→[*] 120 and m/z 350 [*]→[*] 122 for measuring [11 C]species and [M[*]+[*] 1]carrier, respectively (Figure [...]...|$|E

The result of this program making was objected to the nurse and community health service in village area. Thus, it was beneficial to ease the nurse job of monitoring the condition of infant in the incubator. Furthermore, it could lessen the use of paper as media for data storage, for in this program the data storage was done in computers. The monitoring of temperature and humidity take advantages of Delphi 7. 0 program. In order to measure the temperature and humidity in the incubator, we use LM 35 censor and HSM 20 G censor. This Delphi 7. 0 program is able to display the censor test result on the temperature and humidity. In addition, this Delphi program is able to process data and store it on <b>monitoring</b> <b>table</b> on Microsoft Access.

40|$|Description of Intervention: PSI's LaSky program {{targeting}} MSM {{combines the}} distribution of informational and motivational materials to the target group with outreach activities, "edutainment" group sessions and inter-personal communications delivered by trained peer educators and opinion leaders. LaSky also supports an internet site with information, and a counseling telephone hotline. Methodology: The baseline survey in 2006 used time-location sampling; due to low response rates the follow-up in 2008 used respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Sample size was calculated for all the regions together. The baseline was a single-stage cluster sample, with locations where MSM congregate defined as clusters. The number of respondents to be selected was proportionate to cluster size. In every region the {{estimates of the number}} of MSM per cluster were calculated as a part of mapping exercise conducted prior to data collection. The follow-up in 2008 used the clusters defined in 2006 to select seeds (initial respondents). In large metropolitan centers (where the estimated number of total MSM in more than 20, 000) four recruitment waves were completed. In smaller locations the estimated number of MSM is below 10, 000, and three recruitment waves were completed. A total of 539 and 1113 interviews respectively were completed for the baseline and follow-up studies. Analyses consisted of logistic regression and anovas to examine trends over time, to ascertain which determinants are correlated with key behaviors, and to examine the association between program exposure and changes in health behaviors and determinants. Socio-demographic characteristics and geographic location were controlled for in the analyses. Main Findings The <b>monitoring</b> <b>table</b> highlights that: The share of respondents who report having relationships with a permanent partner has reached 82. 0 %, up from 68. 3 % two years ago (p value less than. 001). Yet the number of respondents reporting having casual partners has also increased (p value less than. 05), which suggests that MSM tend to maintain multiple sexual relationships at any given time. Condom use is far from being universal and varies by type of partner. In 2008, condom use at last sex with casual partners was 66. 8 %, and it was only 44. 1 % with permanent partners. The findings show a significant improvement in condom use among casual partners over time, but no change in condom use with permanent partners. The results of segmentation analysis indicate that the probability of MSM using condom during last contact with male partner increases with availability of free condoms. Almost 85 % of those practicing safe sex report having received condoms for free, the respective figure for non-users is 77 % (p value less than. 01). Thus, the availability of free condoms encourages MSM to use condoms. Self-efficacy to discuss condom use. MSM who are confident in their ability to discuss condom use with different types of partners are more likely to use condoms at last sex with a male partner. The respective means are 2. 86 for users and 2. 58 for non-users (p value less than. 001). Perception of condoms making sex less pleasant. Predictably, respondents who disagree with the statement "condoms make sex less pleasant" are more likely to use condoms than those who subscribe to this notion (45 % vs. 30. 2 %, respectively, p value less than. 001). The results of evaluation analysis reveal that PSI program exposure is associated with: An increase in condom use with casual partners as well as commercial partners (p value less than. 05). A greater likelihood of being tested for STIs (p value less than. 05). Increased confidence to negotiate condom use with different types of partners, being better informed about the requirement for HIV test being accompanied by pre-and post-test counseling, and knowing that it is not possible to tell by looking if a person has an STI (p value less than. 05). A higher perception of being at risk for HIV (p value less than. 05). There was no effect on the perception that condoms make sex less pleasant...|$|E

40|$|Performance {{indicators}} are variables {{used to calculate}} on a continuous basis the operational level of a surveillance network's priority activities. A 10 -step process was developed to enable network coordinators to identify specific performance indicators to help them monitor their networks. The methodology {{was based on a}} listing of surveillance activities, the definition and choice of network's global priority objectives, the construction of performance indicators and <b>monitoring</b> <b>tables</b> and the implementation of the system within the network. This process was implemented for the bovine clinical digestive salmonellosis surveillance network in France (RESSAB). The process produced a list of 26 activities synthesized into 15 global objectives, from which 12 were retained as priority objectives. This made it possible to develop 12 performance indicators. Indicators retrospectively calculated for the year 2003 indicated that RESSAB was operating according to the objectives set by the network's stakeholders and its financial supporter. The methodology was implemented successfully and was not very time consuming (12 person-days) or expensive. The decision makers and actors in the network quickly appropriated the system. The methodology can thus be considered validated through this example. Nevertheless, the risks inherent in the use of performance indicators must be addressed by ensuring the relevance of the selected indicators through external assessment and by prioritizing an internal and participatory approach to avoid a misuse of the performance indicators. In addition, considering that performance indicators address only the operation of the network, relevance of surveillance procedure should be addressed by external evaluation...|$|R
