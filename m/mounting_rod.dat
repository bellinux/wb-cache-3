30|$|Several {{methods of}} repair for AASHTO girders {{are being used}} at the present time. These include wraps, U-jackets, and near surface <b>mounted</b> <b>rods.</b> Wraps are {{impractical}} because they require access {{to the top of}} the beam which is most likely covered by the deck and are also expensive. U-jackets are also expensive but do not require access {{to the top of the}} beam. Near surface <b>mounted</b> <b>rods</b> are a less expensive alternative if they can recover strength to the beam, but they also require access to the top of the beam.|$|R
30|$|These {{methods are}} known to work; however, {{full-scale}} structural performance testing on the repair of the prestressed concrete bridge end region (both undamaged and damaged) is still lacking {{and there is also}} not much direct comparison between the methods. The research program examined the effectiveness of three post-damage repair methods including near surface <b>mounted</b> <b>rods,</b> and two types of fiber reinforced polymers. Also, the research investigates whether or not the injection of a high strength-high strain cement-epoxy into the cracked section will help increase the bearing capacity. Additionally, the research is devised to test the effects of adding a distribution plate along with the surface <b>mounted</b> <b>rods.</b> The ultimate goal of this experiment is to find the best, cost effective, most convenient way to repair damaged AASHTO prestressed concrete girders.|$|R
5000|$|Shooting {{galleries}} appeared following {{development of}} rimfire ammunition in the 19th century. Small-caliber gallery guns {{could be easily}} reloaded, providing an opportunity for recreational shooting without the noise, painful recoil, and tiresome reloading procedure required with contemporary muzzleloaders. Shooting galleries became a common feature of Gilded Age amusement parks, and portable bullet traps were later constructed to allow this entertainment with traveling carnivals for locations including fairgrounds. Early shooting galleries typically included several shooting positions for pump-action [...]22 caliber rifles. Durable steel or cast iron targets indicated hits by tipping over or rotating around a horizontal <b>mounting</b> <b>rod.</b> Target distances were short enough to make such movement obvious—as little as 10 feet (3 meters) for portable carnival galleries. The muzzle of each rifle was often chained to a slightly down-range attachment to prevent the rifle from being aimed to miss the bullet trap and threaten bystanders. Injuries from molten lead bullet fragments or ricochets off metal targets or bullet traps encouraged development of frangible bullets in specialized gallery loads including Peters Krumble Ball, Remington Spatter-Less, Western Kant-Splash, and Winchester Spatterpruf. The risk of accidental injuries within crowded amusement parks and carnivals encouraged replacement of firearms by air guns during the late 20th century; and by the 21st century those were largely replaced by simulated firearms using thermographic camera or servomechanism target interactions.|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} failure {{mechanism}} of pneumatic cylinders {{is related to}} wear of head seals. It usually occurs due to excessive radial loads or vibrations (dynamic run-out) or as consequence of an incorrect <b>mounting</b> (<b>rod</b> to bore misalignment). Sealing behaviour has been the object of several analytical and numerical studies orientated to reproduce actual working conditions but perfect rod alignment has been often considered. A tri-dimensional quasi-static numerical model of rod radial misalignment {{and its effect on}} facing seal behaviour is herein presented as a first step of a study concerning mounting effects on head seal performances. In the specific, a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) rod lip seal has been considered. An analytical model was also developed considering the characteristics of the rubber-like material and stiffness variation of the lip seal versus deformation. A non-linear dependence of stiffness on deformation of rubber-like material was found. A cross validation between analytical and numerical models is provided...|$|E
30|$|Reviewing the {{different}} repairs, {{it was concluded}} that the carbon FRP has the greatest amount of stiffness recovery and the glass FRP has the highest percentage of overall strength recovery.

To validate the concept, however, numerical analyses should be carried out as a future study.|$|R

30|$|Cracks on beam 2 end A {{began to}} form during bending testing but {{nowhere near the}} extent of beam 1 end A, so it was left the same for later testing. The beam (beam 3) end {{strengthened}} with surface <b>mounted</b> <b>rods</b> but without epoxy (end A) cracked a considerable amount during its bending test {{and so it was}} stopped slightly early at a deflection of 6.9  mm (0.27  in.). Due to its repair setup a move would have been impossible with the angle steel in the way so all other testing also took place from the initial reaction point.|$|R
30|$|The beam (Beam 3) {{repaired}} with surface <b>mounted</b> <b>rods</b> also behaved as {{was expected}} with the epoxy-injected end. The epoxy-injected end (end B) {{was able to}} provide a peak load of 218  kN (49.1 kips) during bending testing and a peak load of 328  kN (73.8 kips) during shear testing, recovering 69.9  % of its initial bending load and 67.8  % of its initial shear strength. While end A for beam 3 only provided a peak bending load of 170  kN (38.2 kips) and a peak shear load of 247  kN (55.4 kips) and was therefore able to recover 60.1  % in bending and 40.8  % in shear.|$|R

30|$|During {{the testing}} of the {{repaired}} ends, a trend was noticed. In every beam, bulb deterioration was {{the first sign of}} (bearing) failure or, in a couple of cases, the only noticeable failure point. To resolve this, a distribution plate was added to the beam with the surface <b>mounted</b> <b>rod</b> repair to decrease the concentration of stress in the 152  mm (6  in.) of the bulb resting on the support. A 25.4  mm (1  in.) thick steel plate with the same width as the lower bulb that extended 533  mm (21  in.) {{from the end of the}} beam was secured between the steel rods and the bottom of the beam.

30|$|Concrete is an {{economical}} {{construction material}} {{and for that}} reason it is widely used in buildings and infrastructures. The use of deicing salts, expansion joint failure, and freeze–thaw cycles have led to concrete bridge girders experiencing corrosion of steel reinforcement and becoming unsafe for driving. The goal of this research is to assess the effectiveness of current and possible repair techniques for the end region of damaged prestressed concrete girders. To do this, three American Association of State Highway and Transportation prestressed concrete girders were tested to failure, repaired, and retested. Three different repair materials were tested including carbon fiber, glass fiber, and surface <b>mounted</b> <b>rods.</b> Each different repair material was also tested with and without injected epoxy. Comparisons were then made to determine if injecting epoxy had a positive effect on stiffness and strength recovery as well as which repair type regained the largest percentage of original strength.|$|R

40|$|A {{sensitive}} and inexpensive penetrometer is described, {{consisting of a}} <b>mounted</b> <b>rod</b> and polished steel ball that may be advanced downward at variable speed through meat slices mounted on a plexiglass cylinder. The slice + mounting cylinder was placed on a top-loading balance, tared to zero, and centered under the penetrometer rod. Bind strength was measured as the peak force (g) required for the steel ball advancing at 2. 0 cm/min to penetrate the meat slice. Data points (grams force versus time) were collected and plotted using an IBM-compatible personal computer and printer. Since the balance collected gram values continuously, a QuickBasic program was developed, allowing the user to specify the time interval (1, 2, 5 s, etc.) between recorded values. Bind strength of turkey rolls was increased by finely chopping the emulsion (vs. coarsely-ground samples), and by inclusion of 3 % nonfat dry milk. Whey protein concentrate (3 %) increased bind strength of finely chopped, but not coarsely ground rolls...|$|R

40|$|A {{premixed}} flame can be stabilized by an axially <b>mounted</b> <b>rod</b> {{introduced into}} the gas flow, creating an inverted, partially inverted, or regular (Bunsen) flame. Such a setup {{has been used in}} the present study to obtain experimentally the characteristic regions of flame stability for low Reynolds numbers (3600) of a butane/air flame. The results confirm three different shapes of the stable flame: a regular (Bunsen) type for very fuel-rich mixtures and inverted and partially inverted types for stoichiometric and fuel-lean mixtures, respectively. At specific regions, either inverted or partially inverted flames can exist, primarily in dependence on axial distance and radial direction of the ignition source. The blow-off limits show that the convex shape of the inverted flame represents less interaction with the surrounding air, thus enabling the burner to operate at very fuel-lean mixtures. The flashback region has an elongated unstable area, where the flame slowly travels upstream due to reduced quenching effect, which is caused by heat conduction to the rod from the flame.

40|$|The {{anchorage}} of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites {{when applied}} to reinforced concrete (RC) structures as externally bonded reinforcement is an effective means to achieve higher levels of fiber utilization prior to premature debonding failure. Commonly documented anchorage methods for FRP-to-concrete applications demonstrating encouraging results include FRP U-jackets, FRP anchors (also known as spike anchors, among other names), patch anchors (utilizing unidirectional and bidirectional fabrics), nailed metal plates (also known as hybrid bonding), near-surface <b>mounted</b> <b>rods,</b> mechanical fastening, concrete embedment, and mechanical substrate strengthening. Anchorages applied to FRP systems have been verified through experimental testing and numerical modeling to increase the ductility, deformability, and strength of the member and also prevent, delay, or shift the critical mode of FRP debonding failure. Although the benefits of anchorage solutions have now been widely acknowledged by researchers, further studies are {{required in order to}} establish reliable design formulations to negate the requirement for ongoing laboratory verification by industry. The present paper is a state-of-the-art review of experimental studies conducted in the area of FRP anchorage systems applied to FRP-strengthened RC flexural members. Available experimental data are compiled and catalogued and an anchorage efficiency factor for each anchorage type under investigation is assigned in order to quantify the anchor’s efficiency. Finally, current shortcomings in knowledge are identified, in addition to areas needing further investigation...|$|R

40|$|The need of {{rehabilitation}} and strengthening of concrete structures has increased considerably the last decade. The causes for repair and/or strengthening can be many, but normally change of use, increased {{demands on the}} structure, errors in the design or/and construction phase or accidents are governing. Many methods to repair or/and strengthen concrete structures exists such as concrete overlays, shotcrete, external prestressed cables etc. This report presents laboratory tests where concrete T-beams with a length of 6 meters have been strengthened. External prestressed cables and epoxy bonded CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer) rods have been used. Three beams had external tendons, two with steel tendons and one with CFRP. Three beams were strengthened with epoxy bonded CFRP Near Surface <b>Mounted</b> <b>Rods</b> (NSMR). On one of those beams the rods were prestressed before bonding. One beam hade post-stressed internal steel tendons and also a non strengthened reference beam was tested. The results showed that all tested strengthening techniques increased the load carrying capacity of the beams. The beam with external tendons of CFRP obtained problems with the anchor and could therefore not be prestressed to the desired level, which also then had effect on the strengthening level. The other strengthened beams recorded for a strengthening level from 81 % to 107 % depending on the technique used. The tests scores show that prestressing is a very effective strengthening method to increase the load carrying capacity of existing concrete beams. Godkänd; 2005; 20080522 (ysko...|$|R
