5|$|Xbox One X's {{design is}} a {{revision}} of the Xbox One S hardware, but further streamlined. It uses a system-on-chip (SoC) known as Scorpio Engine, which incorporates a 2.3GHz octa-core CPU, and a Radeon GPU with 40 Compute Units clocked at 1172MHz, generating 6 teraflops of graphical computing performance. It also includes 12GB of GDDR5 RAM, 9 GB of which is allocated to games. To assist in optimizing the new hardware to run existing games at 4K resolution, Microsoft developers used internal debugging software to collect GPU traces from major titles that did not run at full 1080p resolution on the original Xbox One. Scorpio Engine's CPU utilizes a custom platform designed to maintain compatibility with the Jaguar CPU of the original Xbox One, but with a 31% increase in performance; the custom platform is unrelated to AMD's current Ryzen architecture. The console will feature a vapor chamber <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> for the SoC, and motherboards will be tailored to the exact voltage needs of each individual Scorpio SoC to optimize their output and energy usage. The console will also support AMD's FreeSync technology on compatible displays.|$|E
25|$|This is a heat {{exchanger}} with a gas passing upwards through {{a shower of}} fluid (often water), and the fluid is then taken elsewhere before being cooled.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} {{impacts on the}} {{particle}} {{size and shape of}} silica sands by roasting times and different <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling,</b> which finds out that different <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> may lead to different <b>cooling</b> rates <b>of</b> sands; that is, adopt water-cooled fluidized bed to cool down sands, the cooling rate is the highest; the secondary is by cooling cylinder, and common fluidized bed leads to the lowest cooling rate. After being roasted and cooled, no matter which method is adopted, the sands are not changed obviously in particle size and shape, which indicates that roasting times, different cooling methods and cooling rates have no obvious impacts on the particle size and shape of silica sands...|$|R
25|$|Many hi-fi, {{and almost}} all {{professional}} low frequency loudspeakers (woofers) include vents in the magnet system to provide forced-air cooling of the voice coil. The pumping action of the cone and dustcap draws in and expels cool air.

25|$|The {{continuous}} {{torque density}} of conventional electric machines {{is determined by}} the size of the air-gap area and the back-iron depth, which are determined by the power rating of the armature winding set, the speed of the machine, and the achievable air-gap flux density before core saturation. Despite the high coercivity of neodymium or samarium-cobalt PMs, continuous torque density is virtually the same amongst electric machines with optimally designed armature winding sets. Continuous torque density relates to <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> and permissible period of operation before destruction by overheating of windings or PM damage.|$|E
25|$|Another device {{which has}} contributed {{significantly}} to milk quality is the plate heat exchanger (PHE). This device utilizes a number of specially designed stainless steel plates with small spaces between them. Milk is passed between every other set of plates with water being passed between {{the balance of the}} plates to remove heat from the milk. This <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> can remove large amounts of heat from the milk in a very short time, thus drastically slowing bacteria growth and thereby improving milk quality. Ground water is the most common source of cooling medium for this device. Dairy cows consume approximately 3 gallons of water for every gallon of milk production and prefer to drink slightly warm water as opposed to cold ground water. For this reason, PHE's can result in drastically improved milk quality, reduced operating costs for the dairymen by reducing the refrigeration load on his bulk milk cooler, and increased milk production by supplying the cows with a source of fresh warm water.|$|E

50|$|Another common <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> is exposing {{an object}} to ice, dry ice, or liquid nitrogen. This works by convection; {{the heat is}} {{transferred}} from the relatively warm object to the relatively cold coolant.|$|E
50|$|In this <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> {{the cold}} {{side of the}} sensor is mounted onto a heat {{conductor}} (usually an aluminium heat sink), and heat is dissipated to the surrounding by conduction (through heat conductor) and convection (air flow).|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The only {{effective}} treatment for heat injury (heatstroke) is rapid cooling.

50|$|Compressor and Peltier {{refrigerators}} are {{powered by}} electricity. Absorption units {{can be designed}} to get power from any heat source. A noticeable {{difference between the two}} types is the absence of refrigerant with Peltier coolers (these use a different <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling).</b> But Peltier coolers use more electricity because they are thermodynamically inefficient.|$|E
50|$|In this <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> {{the heat}} is {{actively}} transferred to the environment.

40|$|Although {{physical}} <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> are {{the treatment}} of choice for hyperthermia, their value in {{the treatment of}} fever remains uncertain. Methods involving convection and evap-oration are more effective than those involving conduction for the treatment of hyperthermia. These same methods, combined with antipyretic medication, are preferable to immersion as treatment for fever in young children but are generally not practical in adults. Febrile children treated with tepid-water sponging plus antipyretic drugs are more uncomfortable that those treated with antipyretic drugs alone, although they exhibit slightly more rapid reductions in temperature. When febrile, seriously ill patients are externally cooled and are sedated or paralyzed with drugs that suppress shivering, they may have a more rapid reduction of fever and reduced energy expenditure than if treated with antipyretic drugs alone. A risk/bene®t assessment of the consequences of such treatment is not yet possible. Although clinicians have used conductive, convective, and evaporative <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> to lower body temperature for 12500 years, the bene®ts of such treatments are uncertain even to this day.
