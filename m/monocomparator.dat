40|$|The {{small scale}} (1 : 820 000) space {{photography}} {{obtained by the}} metric camera that was mounted in the European Spacelab flown {{at the end of}} 1983 has been subjected to geometric test. The test includes single photo and stereopair treatment. The Wild AC- 1 analytical plotter {{has been used as a}} <b>monocomparator</b> for single photo measurement and as a stereo-comparator for measurement on the stereopair. Analytical anharmonic rectification and conventional absolute orientation were used to transform single photo co-ordinates and stereomodel co-ordinates respectively, to ground co-ordinates. The results show that planimetric accuracy from space photography is governed by the ground resolution of the photography. -from Autho...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} several {{offshore}} islands, rocks and shoals on the Labrador Coast was performed, using LANDSAT imagery {{to assist in}} the location of uncharted hydrographic features. Several satellite coverages of the coast were studied prior to the survey, and suspected shoal points identified. Using map-derived control points and <b>monocomparator</b> measurements of the LANDSAT images, the positions of these points were determined by mathematical adjustment to an estimated position accuracy of 150 meters. As a result, on the survey, an uncharted island and eight uncharted drying rocks, which might easily have escaped detection from a survey ship, were verified and positioned. To check the accuracy of the coordinates derived from LANDSAT, three islands were positioned by standard ground survey methods. The positional differences, all less than 150 meters, are not plottable at the scale of the existing offshore charts. The LANDSAT positions were also used to control aerial photography of a shoal area for office compilation of a hydrographic chart...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Two strips of U- 2 RC- 10 images were analytically triangulated and adjusted. Control points and pass points were marked on glass plates made from B&W copy negatives of IR color transparencies. A wild PUG- 3 and TA 1 /p <b>monocomparator</b> {{were used to}} mark and measure the points on the glass plates. Each plate was measured twice in the same orientation for a check on accuracy and operator error. The 22 photographs were adjusted to 41 ground control and tie points and the block adjustment was performed in a secant plane coordinate system to eliminate the effect of earth curvature. Standard deviations of the residuals of the control and tie points were 12. 8 m, 10. 8 m, and 4. 5 m for the X, Y, and Z coordinates respectively. The 12. 8 m and 10. 8 m figures correspond to an identification accuracy of 0. 1 mm on the U- 2 RC- 10 plates. The standard deviations of the residuals encountered in the ERTS- 1 resectioning were: (1) 0. 16 mm assuming uncorrected perspective geometry and (2) 0. 12 mm when the polynomial adjustment was added in. These results indicate a reduction of 0. 11 in the square error due to the polynomial adjustment...|$|E
