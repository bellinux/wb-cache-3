2500|$|Matthew Speltz of the University of Washington School of Medicine {{states that}} the roots of {{attachment}} therapy are traceable to psychologist Robert Zaslow and his [...] "Z-process" [...] in the 1970s. Zaslow attempted to force attachment in those suffering from autism by creating rage while holding them against their will. He believed this {{would lead to a}} breakdown in their defense mechanisms, making them more receptive to others. Zaslow thought attachment arose when an infant experienced feelings of pain, fear and rage, and then <b>made</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> with the carer who relieved those feelings. If an infant did not experience this cycle of events by having his fear and rage relieved, the infant would not form an attachment and would not make eye contact with other people. Zaslow believed that creating pain and rage and combining them with eye contact would cause attachment to occur, long after the normal age for such developments. Holding therapies derive from these [...] "rage-reduction" [...] techniques applied by Zaslow. The holding is not used for safety purposes but is initiated for the purpose of provoking strong negative emotions such as fear and anger. The child's release typically depends upon his or her compliance with the therapist's [...] agenda or goals.

5000|$|In concealing deception, nonverbal {{communication}} {{makes it}} easier to lie without being revealed. This is the conclusion of a study where people watched made-up interviews of persons accused of having stolen a wallet. The interviewees lied in about 50% of the cases. People had access to either written transcript of the interviews, or audio tape recordings, or video recordings. The more clues that were available to those watching, the larger was the trend that interviewees who actually lied were judged to be truthful. That is, people that are clever at lying can use tone of voice and facial expressions {{to give the impression that}} they are truthful. Contrary to popular belief, a liar does not always avoid <b>eye</b> <b>contact.</b> In an attempt to be more convincing, liars deliberately <b>made</b> more <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> with interviewers than those that were telling the truth. [...] However, there are many cited examples of cues to deceit, delivered via nonverbal (paraverbal and visual) communication channels, through which deceivers supposedly unwittingly provide clues to their concealed knowledge or actual opinions. Most studies examining the nonverbal cues to deceit rely upon human coding of video footage (c.f. Vrij, 2008), although a recent study also demonstrated bodily movement differences between truth-tellers and liars using an automated body motion capture system.|$|R

40|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>contact</b> has a {{fundamental}} role in human social interaction. The special {{appearance of the}} human eye (i. e., white sclera contrasted with a coloured iris) implies the importance of detecting another person’s face through <b>eye</b> <b>contact.</b> Empirical studies have demonstrated that faces making <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> are detected quickly and processed preferentially (i. e., the <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> effect). Such sensitivity to <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> seems to be innate and universal among humans; however, several studies suggest that cultural norms affect <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> behaviours. For example, Japanese individuals exhibit less <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> than do individuals from Western European or North American cultures.
