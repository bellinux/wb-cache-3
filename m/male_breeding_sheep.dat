40|$|To provide <b>breeding</b> <b>male</b> animals {{free from}} {{diseases}} {{is one of}} the biggest problems of small ruminant farming. Farms that can not find suitable <b>breeding</b> <b>male</b> materials have to use the same ram or Bucks for long periods of time and thus the herds have not reached the desired levels in terms of the yield and yield declines are the case. By establishing ram-buck provision and test stations, this problem could be solved to according to the expectations of the breeders to provide qualified rams. The main target in the establishment of these centers is to collect ram or buck candidate male offsprings through pre-selection methods from the farms where the breeders can not keep them in their herds due to economical hardships. After the tests, the selected convenient breeding candidates could be utilized in the breeding herds in natural or artificial insemination methods to meet the need for <b>breeding</b> <b>male</b> materials. In this article, some difficulties and proposals have been given towards the establishment of test stations to provide <b>breeding</b> <b>male</b> material for small ruminant farming in countries like Turkey, where extensive breeding is in use and where recording systems have not yet been launched yet, and towards the roles of the <b>Breeding</b> <b>Sheep</b> and Buck Breeders’ Associations...|$|R

30|$|As {{a result}} of natural {{breeding}} and the high proportion of males to females in the nomadic flock, <b>male</b> <b>breeding</b> stock was kept and grazed separately during the breeding season.

Nomads knew that when strong-smelling bucks are not separated from the does during breeding season, their scent will affect the milk. In organic farming, <b>male</b> <b>breeding</b> stock has to be kept in the farm. It is permissible to use conventionally-kept <b>male</b> <b>breeding</b> stock.|$|R

40|$|Surveys of vocalizing {{individuals}} {{are useful in}} detecting widely dispersed species {{that are hard to}} locate visually. We determined whether conspecific density affects spontaneous vocalizations of territorial Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo) and thus creates a bias in passive auditory surveys. We mainly listened to dusk call displays of 17 <b>males</b> <b>breeding</b> in two areas of high and low density from the beginning of call activity in October to the start of egg-laying in February. We detected differences in call behavior between <b>males</b> <b>breeding</b> in high density vs. low density. The nearest neighbor distance between <b>breeding</b> <b>males</b> strongly and positively affected call duration. Low density caused low detectability of male Eagle Owls, and later timing of the first call after sunset. Failing to incorporate conspecific density and nearest neighbor distances in surveys of territorial species may reduce the accuracy of population estimates. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This is the {{accepted}} {{version of the}} paper. The final published version {{is available from the}} Royal Society at [URL] differences in breeding lifespan are an important source of variation in male fitness, the factors affecting the <b>breeding</b> tenure of <b>males</b> have seldom been explored. Here, we use cross-species comparisons to investigate the correlates of <b>breeding</b> lifespan in <b>male</b> mammals. Our results show that <b>male</b> <b>breeding</b> lifespan depends on the extent of polygyny, which reflects the relative intensity of competition for access to females. Males have relatively short breeding tenure in species where individuals have the potential to monopolize mating with multiple females, and longer ones where individuals defend one female at a time. <b>Male</b> <b>breeding</b> tenure is also shorter in species in which females breed frequently than in those where females breed less frequently, suggesting that the costs of guarding females may contribute to limiting tenure length. As a consequence of these relationships, estimates of skew in <b>male</b> <b>breeding</b> success within seasons overestimate skew calculated across the lifetime and, in several polygynous species, variance in lifetime breeding success is not substantially higher in males than in females.
