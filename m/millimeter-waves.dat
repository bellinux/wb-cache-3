40|$|The {{objective}} of the proposed research is to study methods that improve reception quality in <b>millimeter-wave</b> wireless communications. <b>Millimeter-wave</b> bands provide sufficient spectral resource for directional small-cell coverage in a heterogeneous network. However, high-efficient communications in <b>millimeter-wave</b> frequencies need line-of-sight propagation. Coordinated multi-point transmissions can combat interference, increase the probability of line-of-sight propagation, and improve system efficiency, but have stringent requirements on synchronizations and backhaul capacity.

40|$|The use of <b>millimeter-waves</b> for imaging {{purposes}} {{is becoming}} increasingly important, as <b>millimeter-waves</b> can penetrate most clothing and packaging materials, so that the detector does not require physical contact with the object. This will offer a view to the hidden content of e. g. packets or bags without the need to open them, whereby packaging and content will not be damaged. Nowadays X-ray is used, but as the millimeter-wave quantum energy is far below the ionization energy, it is less harmful for the human health.

40|$|With the use {{of higher}} and higher {{frequencies}} {{in a number of}} current and future wireless millimeter-wave applications it is beneficial to use photonics for several reasons. The use of optical fibers is an advantageous way to transport <b>millimeter-waves</b> in terms of loss, mechanical flexibility, weight, and insensitivity to electromagnetic interference. Photonics can also be used for analog applications such as signal generation and signal processing of <b>millimeter-waves,</b> as well as in high-capacity wireless communication networks, referred to as radio-over-fiber. In this thesis, novel techniques for signal generation and data transmission using photonics are presented. The techniques for millimeter-wave signal generation include optical phase modulators for harmonic frequency generation and the optical nonlinear phenomenon four-wave-mixing for frequency multiplication in the optical domain. Different setups are used for generation of millimeter-wave carriers at 40 GHz utilizing the polarization properties of an optical phase modulator. The millimeter-wave carrier is created from signals at 10 GHz {{and the quality of the}} 40 GHz carrier is mainly determined by the original source. This principle is then further refined into an opto-electronic oscillator. Harmonic frequencies were extracted and carriers up to 60 GHz were created. A six-fold frequency multiplication is presented based on carrier suppression technique and optical four-wave mixing. This technique is scalable to very high frequencies, and the potential is demonstrated with a 6. 7 GHz input and 40 GHz output. Furthermore, analog processing of <b>millimeter-waves</b> such as filtering or phase delaying is investigated in the optical domain with {{the use of}} fiber Bragg gratings. The concept of radio-over-fiber is demonstrated in this thesis using a high bit-rate data pattern modulating a 40 GHz millimeter-wave carrier downlink from central station to base station. The benefits of using a centralized approach are that expensive and sensitive equipment could be located in the central station, in a less hostile environment, and also be shared by a number of connected base stations. The overall cost can thereby be reduced.

Unlike the microwave band, there is a very large amount of underutilized bandwidth at these frequencies. However, <b>millimeter-wave</b> (30 to 300 GHz) and terahertz (300 to 1 THz) communication systems are affected by significant signal attenuation due to path loss and shadowing [366]. Moreover, oscillators at such high-carrier frequencies are not as accurate compared to their counterparts at microwave frequencies and, as such, <b>millimeter-wave</b> and terahertz are significantly more impacted by CFO and phase noise [366]. In addition to all of the above, amplifiers at <b>millimeter-wave</b> and terahertz are expected to operate in the saturation region to generate enough power to overcome the shadowing and path loss issues in these bands. As such, the received signal at these frequencies may be severely affected by nonlinearities [367].|$|R

The tunable <b>millimeter-wave</b> {{is generated by}} adjusting the RF-modulation frequency and bias currents. Summary The optical generation of <b>millimeter-wave</b> has been demonstrated and attracted much attention because of its flexibility and applicability in broadband mobile communication systems and optical beam forming [l, 21. Specifically, sideband injection locking technique using master and slave laser is promising for generating <b>millimeter-wave</b> since it is simple to implement and gives high tunability. However the experimental setups used to achieve sideband injection locking often require two or more light sources-a master laser and a slave laser, or a master laser and two slave lasers [2, 31.

In particular to develop standardization for 5 G, which is expected around 2020. The existing spectrum for traditional mobile networks is limited to highly occupied bands at microwave frequencies below 6 GHz. It is expected that 5 G will use <b>millimeter-waves</b> to enable higher data rates. Even though losses at <b>millimeter-waves</b> are higher, higher data rates for short range applications can be achieved due to the available wide bandwidth. The radio channel between a transmitter and a receiver has {{a great impact on}} the quality of the received signals. The channel includes everything between the transmitter and receiver that may impact the signals, such as buildings, walls, windows, etc. High data rate transmission at millimeter-wave frequencies requires size- and cost-efficient circuitry. The recent advances in nanotechnology and semiconductor devices enable the signal generation at <b>millimeter-waves.</b> The existence of the available extreme bandwidth at millimeter-wave frequencies enables the application of impulse radio using high frequency ultra-short pulses. Transmission of a short pulse through antennas and a free-space radio channel without significant distortion requires a wideband antenna with high fidelity. In this thesis a time-domain antenna system with ultra-short pulse transmission and reception at <b>millimeter-waves</b> is presented. The antenna system consists of wideband and non-dispersive leaky lens antennas and a high frequency short pulse (wavelet) generator based on III-V technology. The time-domain system is presented in Paper I. The transmission of 100 ps long pulses at 60 GHz produced by the wavelet generator through different antennas is investigated. It is shown that the leaky lens antennas have negligible pulse distortion and preserve the shape of the generated high frequency short pulses. Further characterizations of the leaky lens antennas for the 60 GHz band, using a time-domain gating method is presented in Paper III. The results show that the antenna has a low dispersion and can thereby transmit short pulses with high fidelity. A time-domain characterization method at <b>millimeter-waves</b> using the antenna system is presented in Paper II. The complex permittivity of low loss non-magnetic materials with low dispersion are estimated directly from the received time-domain pulses. The wide bandwidth of the wavelet is also used to determine the frequency dependence of dispersive materials. Time-domain scattering analysis of periodic structures is presented in Paper IV and Paper V. A sum rule for scattering in parallel-plate waveguides based on energy conservation and the optical theorem is derived in Paper IV. A parallel-plate waveguide with wideband TEM horn antennas and a parallel-plate capacitor are used for dynamic and low frequency (static) measurements, respectively. The results show that the all waveleghts electromagnetic interaction introduced by the object is given by the static polarizability. The broad bandwidth and high resolution of the time-domain system is utilized for radar imaging application in Sec. 6 of the Research Overview. The images are obtained through gridding method which is a classical Fourier reconstruction and l 1 -minimization problem.

The first technique {{is concerned with the}} optical generation and distribution of microwave and <b>millimeter-wave</b> signals. The second is concerned with the optical up-conversion of an electrical subcarrier signal from a low-frequency band to the <b>millimeter-wave</b> band. The thesis consists of two parts: In the first, three approaches to generating frequency-tunable, high spectral-purity microwave and <b>millimeter-wave</b> signals in the optical domain are proposed and experimentally demonstrated. These approaches are based on external optical modulation using an optical intensity modulator or an optical phase modulator. The key advantage of these approaches is that high spectral purity, frequency-tunable microwave and <b>millimeter-wave</b> signals can be generated using a simple configuration with no tunable optical filter. In addition, optical carrier recovery at a radio-over-fiber base station is also experimentally demonstrated. A detailed theoretical study on the spectral purity of the optically generated and distributed microwave or <b>millimeter-wave</b> signals based on external optical modulation techniques is also conducted. These theoretical results are verified by experiments. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, an approach to optically up-converting an electrical subcarrier signal from a low-frequency band to a <b>millimeter-wave</b> band is proposed. In this approach, two phase-correlated optical waves, which are separated by a frequency difference in the <b>millimeter-wave</b> frequency band, are directly modulated by an electrical subcarrier using an optical intensity modulator. Theoretical analysis shows that the information carried by the low-frequency electrical subcarrier is up-converted to a subcarrier in the <b>millimeter-wave</b> band.
