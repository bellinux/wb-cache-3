5|$|A {{simplified}} Japan-exclusive {{mobile phone}} adaptation retitled Musashi: Mobile Samurai {{was released in}} 2005. After {{the release of the}} game, plans were <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sequel, but were then delayed for years. A PlayStation 2 sequel, titled , was developed by Square Enix and was released worldwide in 2005.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{plans have}} been <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> major urban {{extension}} in the town, mainly {{to the east of}} the railway station. When finished, the town would be around 30% larger and 3,200 new homes would be built on 'Stanton Cross' site, with new schools, bus stops, community centres, shops, a doctor's surgery and new open spaces.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} why Michelangelo {{selected}} the five particular Sibyls that were depicted, given that, as with the Minor Prophets, there were ten or twelve possibilities. It is suggested by John O'Malley that the choice was <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wide geographic coverage, with the Sibyls coming from Africa, Asia, Greece and Ionia.|$|E

5|$|The Rovers {{fans have}} good {{relations}} with Spanish club CE Sabadell FC, which initially began due to several Rovers fans noticing that the club had the same colours. Plans are being <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pre-season friendly between the two clubs in July 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on June 21, 1991 and received generally favorable reviews from critics, although plans for Rocketeer sequels were abandoned after the film was a disappointment at the box office, grossing $46 million on a $40 million budget, $6 million over the film's budget. As of 2012, new efforts were being <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> remake.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the age of}} the bucentaurs, it is {{probable}} that for ceremonies in the Venetian Lagoon the doge was simply assigned a small galley from the Venetian fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans were <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> special ship to be built. This is evidenced by the promissioni – sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{original}} Doctor Who series reached its conclusion, some tentative plans had been <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> proposed 27th season {{under the assumption}} that it would maintain the then-current pattern of two four-part and two three-part stories. As noted in each entry, Big Finish Productions has produced audio adaptations of several scripts as part of their The Lost Stories releases. The safecracking companion introduced in Crime of the Century (see below), who was never named during the planning, has now been given a name, that of Raine Creevey, and she is portrayed by Beth Chalmers.|$|E
5|$|Cloud was {{designed}} and released in 2005 {{by a team of}} seven students in the Interactive Media master's degree program at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. The game was not <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> specific class. Development began in January 2005 and the game was released in late October, receiving its final update in December. The group was headed by Jenova Chen and included Stephen Dinehart, Erik Nelson, Aaron Meyers, Glenn Song, composer Vincent Diamante, and producer Kellee Santiago. The game won the 2005 Game Innovation Grant of $20,000 from the USC, which is intended to support the production of experimental games. The idea for the game was partially based on Chen's childhood experience, as he was often hospitalized for asthma and would daydream while waiting for the doctors.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong creator Shigeru Miyamoto {{allegedly}} criticised the game, calling its gameplay mediocre. However, he {{has since}} addressed these rumors and expressed fondness for the game. Although described as overrated, it was ranked as the 90th-best game <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Nintendo system in Nintendo Powers Top 200 Games list in 2006. It also received a Nintendo Power Award for Best Overall Game of 1994 and two Kids' Choice awards in 1994 and 1995 for Favorite Video Game. The game {{would go on to}} eventually sell a total of 9 million copies. In the United States alone, its Game Boy Advance re-release sold 960,000 copies and earned $26 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 19th highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{emphasis}} placed on cooperation with Britain, relatively few Australian military units were stationed in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region after 1940. Measures were taken to improve Australia's defences as war with Japan loomed in 1941, but these proved inadequate. The 8th Division was subsequently dispatched to Singapore in February 1941, while plans were <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Militia battalion to be stationed between Port Moresby and Thursday Island. An AIF battalion was also allocated to garrison Rabaul, and another brigade would be dispersed piecemeal to Timor and Ambon. Meanwhile, in July 1941 the 1st Independent Company was deployed to Kavieng on New Britain {{in order to protect}} the airfield, while sections were sent to Namatanai in central New Ireland, Vila in the New Hebrides, Tulagi on Guadalcanal, Buka Passage in Bougainville, and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers.|$|E
5|$|Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin {{had ordered}} all {{settlers}} to stay {{to the east}} of the Divide, as the state and federal governments had not made peace with the Utes. Nevertheless, some defied the order, drawn by the prospect of mining fortunes. Settlers sometimes used Hunter Pass to get to Ashcroft, an early camp on Castle Creek above the Roaring Fork. However, they preferred to take the southern route over the slightly higher Cottonwood Pass through Taylor Park and then back over Taylor Pass to get there, even though this <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 100-mile (160km) journey, 40 miles (64km) more than the direct route offered by Hunter Pass.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, just {{sixteen years}} after it was built, the church was {{destroyed}} by fire. This was not uncommon, however, as devastating fires frequently plagued the developing colony, and a new cathedral was quickly built on the same site. It featured iconic twin steeples at its facade. However, the Victoria Harbour waterfront district where the church was situated became more overcrowded with the rapid growth of Hong Kong at the time, and it became apparent that a permanent and larger cathedral was necessary. As a result, plans were <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new church on a more elevated ground in Mid-Levels, located close to the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, a music album called Vayuputras, an {{original}} soundtrack {{based on the}} Shiva Trilogy books, was released. The album {{is an extension of}} The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas with special tracks inspired by important junctures like Shiva's dance and the war speech in the books. Artists like Sonu Nigam, Taufiq Qureshi, Palash Sen, Bickram Ghosh worked on the album. This was the first time ever that {{an original}} soundtrack was <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> book series.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{plans were}} <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> limited-access Relief Route of US 13 between Dover and the Wilmington area that would {{alleviate}} it of traffic {{heading to the}} Delaware Beaches in the summer. This Relief Route would become designated as part of DE 1, a route that ran along the Atlantic Ocean in Sussex County and north to Milford. The DE 1 toll road between Dover Air Force Base and Christiana opened in stages between 1991 and 2003. The total cost to build the DE 1 toll road was $900 million {{and it was the}} largest public works project in Delaware history.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two episodes, it is {{revealed}} that Wirt and Greg are actually two boys from the modern era. Wirt and Greg's strange appearance {{stems from the fact}} that the night they entered the Unknown was Halloween. Wirt, attempting to take back an embarrassing poetry tape he <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> girl he likes, had followed her to a graveyard scary story gathering before a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden wall. On the other side of the wall, they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train. Wirt pushed them both off a hill into a lake/river in an attempt to save him, knocking them both unconscious in the process and sending them to a Limbo-like realm between life and death.|$|E
