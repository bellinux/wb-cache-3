5|$|Injection <b>moulding</b> is {{a complex}} {{technology}} with possible production problems. They can be caused either by defects in the moulds, or more often by the <b>moulding</b> process itself.|$|E
5|$|Parts to be {{injection}} moulded {{must be very}} carefully designed to facilitate the <b>moulding</b> process; the material used for the part, the desired shape and features of the part, the material of the mould, and {{the properties of the}} <b>moulding</b> machine must all be taken into account. The versatility of injection <b>moulding</b> is facilitated by this breadth of design considerations and possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Rubber {{injection}} <b>moulding</b> process {{produces a}} high yield of durable products, {{making it the}} most efficient and cost-effective method of <b>moulding.</b> Consistent vulcanisation processes involving precise temperature control significantly reduces all waste material.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow for}} {{removal of the}} <b>moulded</b> part from the <b>mould,</b> the <b>mould</b> {{features}} must not overhang {{one another in the}} direction that the <b>mould</b> opens, unless parts of the <b>mould</b> are designed to move from between such overhangs when the <b>mould</b> opens (using components called Lifters).|$|R
50|$|Steel, wood, GRP, {{and other}} {{materials}} are used as <b>mould</b> materials for prototyping purposes. The <b>mould</b> can be a male or female <b>mould.</b> To make shower bathtubs, a male <b>mould</b> is used. In the boating industry, a single-sided female <b>mould</b> made from FRP (fibre-reinforced plastic) is used to make yacht hulls. The outer shell of the <b>mould</b> is stiffened by a wood frame. The <b>mould</b> is made by taking the reversal of a male pattern. Several different hull sizes can be made using the same <b>mould.</b> The length of the <b>mould</b> is shortened or lengthened using inserts and <b>mould</b> secondaries such as windows, air vents, and propeller shaft tunnels.|$|R
5|$|A <b>mould</b> {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the <b>moulded</b> part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the <b>mould</b> when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or <b>mould</b> gates, are located below the parting line or <b>mould</b> surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} <b>mould</b> on the parting line. The <b>moulded</b> part is cut (by the <b>mould)</b> from the runner system on ejection from the <b>mould.</b> Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the <b>mould</b> (usually the ejector half), which push the finished <b>moulded</b> product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the <b>mould.</b>|$|R
5|$|Injection <b>moulding</b> is used {{to create}} many things such as wire spools, packaging, bottle caps, {{automotive}} parts and components, gameboys, pocket combs, some musical instruments (and parts of them), one-piece chairs and small tables, storage containers, mechanical parts (including gears), and most other plastic products available today. Injection <b>moulding</b> {{is the most common}} modern method of manufacturing plastic parts; it is ideal for producing high volumes of the same object.|$|E
5|$|Like all {{industrial}} processes, injection <b>moulding</b> {{can produce}} flawed parts. In {{the field of}} injection <b>moulding,</b> troubleshooting is often performed by examining defective parts for specific defects and addressing these defects with {{the design of the}} mould or the characteristics of the process itself. Trials are often performed before full production runs in an effort to predict defects and determine the appropriate specifications to use in the injection process.|$|E
5|$|Mould or die are {{the common}} terms used to {{describe}} the tool used to produce plastic parts in <b>moulding.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{selection}} of the optimal <b>mould</b> material and production methodology is an underestimated aspect during the design of injection <b>moulds,</b> specially when hybrid <b>moulds</b> are used. Hybrid <b>moulds</b> are <b>moulds</b> where conventional manufacturing techniques such as milling are combined with Rapid Tooling techniques like Selective Laser Sintering. This paper {{presents the results of}} several ongoing research projects about the influence of conventional and hybrid <b>mould</b> materials related to the thermal behaviour and tribology of injection <b>moulds...</b>|$|R

40|$|Excessive {{dampness}} and <b>mould</b> {{growth on}} building material surfaces and contents can pose health risks {{and should not}} be tolerated in indoor environments. • A <b>mould</b> assessment determines if <b>mould</b> is present, but does not determine or estimate <b>mould</b> exposure. • Health-based exposure limits for indoor <b>mould</b> in residential environments have not been established; inspecting for visible and hidden <b>mould,</b> removing <b>mould</b> where present, and repairing and controlling sources of excessive moisture is the best approach to controlling health risks. • Visual inspection is recommended as the primary tool for assessing indoor moisture and <b>mould.</b> <b>Mould</b> sampling is recommended only when the results of a visual inspection are ambiguous or when more detailed information is necessary. • Awareness and ongoing prevention activities for <b>mould</b> and moisture are important strategies for building occupants and homeowners...|$|R
5|$|The German chemists Arthur Eichengrün and Theodore Becker {{invented the}} first soluble forms of {{cellulose}} acetate in 1903, which was much less flammable than cellulose nitrate. It was eventually made available in a powder form from which it was readily injection moulded. Arthur Eichengrün developed the first injection <b>moulding</b> press in 1919. In 1939, Arthur Eichengrün patented the injection <b>moulding</b> of plasticised cellulose acetate.|$|E
5|$|The plastic {{injection}} <b>moulding</b> {{industry has}} evolved over the years from producing combs and buttons to producing {{a vast array of}} products for many industries including automotive, medical, aerospace, consumer products, toys, plumbing, packaging, and construction.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of {{cavities}} {{play a vital role}} in <b>moulding</b> costs, so does the complexity of the part's design. Complexity can be incorporated into many factors such as surface finishing, tolerance requirements, internal or external threads, fine detailing or {{the number of}} undercuts that may be incorporated.|$|E
50|$|Mouldmaking. A <b>mould</b> {{is made of}} the {{original}} model or sculpture. The rigid outer <b>moulds</b> contain the softer inner <b>mould,</b> which is the exact negative of {{the original}} model. Inner <b>moulds</b> are usually made of latex, polyurethane rubber or silicone, which {{is supported by the}} outer <b>mould.</b> The outer <b>mould</b> can be made from plaster, but can also be made of fiberglass or other materials. Most <b>moulds</b> are made of at least two pieces, and a shim with keys is placed between the parts during construction so that the <b>mould</b> can be put back together accurately. If there are long, thin pieces extending out of the model, they are often cut off of the original and <b>moulded</b> separately. Sometimes many <b>moulds</b> are needed to recreate the original model, especially for large models.|$|R
40|$|Today, {{the time}} to market for metal casting {{products}} is becoming shorter, thus the lead time available for making the wax injection <b>mould</b> is decreasing. There is potential for timesaving in the <b>mould</b> design stage. This paper presents {{the basic structure of}} an interactive knowledge based wax injection <b>mould</b> design system. The basic of this system arises from an analysis of the wax injection <b>mould</b> design process for <b>mould</b> design companies. This wax injection <b>mould</b> design system covers both the <b>mould</b> design process and <b>mould</b> base standardization. In this system, the graphic module and the knowledge based module for generating <b>mould</b> features are integrated within an interactive Mold Wizard platform, Unigraphics system. This ensures that both speeds up the wax injection <b>mould</b> design process, without the need to redesign the <b>mould</b> base layout. With this capability, metal casting product could be designed quickly, cheaply with quality and competitively...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional finite-element thermal-stress {{models have}} been {{developed}} to predict temperature, distortion and residual stress in the <b>mould</b> of thin slab continuous casters. Geometrically, {{there are two kinds of}} <b>mould</b> to achieve high-speed casting: funnel-shaped and parallel <b>mould.</b> The <b>mould</b> shape and high casting speed leads to higher <b>mould</b> temperatures and shorter <b>mould</b> life than in conventional slab casters. The purpose of this study is to investigate the heat flux and the effects of <b>mould</b> shape on distortion of the <b>mould</b> in a thin slab caster. <b>Mould</b> wall temperature measured in the plant was analyzed to determine corresponding the heat-flux profiles in thin slab <b>moulds</b> using an Inverse Heat Conduction model, and this data was then used in an elastic-visco-plastic analysis to investigate the deformation of the <b>moulds</b> in service for different the <b>mould</b> shapes. The model predictions of temperature and distortion during operation match plant observations. During operation, the hot face temperature reaches 430 oC and the copper plates bend toward the steel, with a maximum outward distortion of about 0. 3 mm. This occurs just above the center of the wide faces, and is smaller than the distortion of a conventional slab <b>mould...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{number of}} {{cavities}} {{incorporated into a}} mould will directly correlate in <b>moulding</b> costs. Fewer cavities require far less tooling work, so {{limiting the number of}} cavities in-turn will result in lower initial manufacturing costs to build an injection mould.|$|E
5|$|American {{inventor}} John Wesley Hyatt {{together with}} his brother Isaiah, Hyatt patented the first injection <b>moulding</b> machine in 1872. This machine was relatively simple compared to machines in use today: it worked like a large hypodermic needle, using a plunger to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs.|$|E
40|$|Modern CAD/CAM {{techniques}} {{together with}} 5 axis high speed milling allow to reduce <b>moulds</b> manufacturing time and costs. Nevertheless, {{in order to}} use the <b>moulds,</b> operations of manual finishing and fitting are still always required. Such operations, performed manually by <b>mould</b> makers, modify milled surfaces of the <b>moulds.</b> Changes in the product's shape are sometimes decided after the <b>mould</b> has already been machined. In such cases, if it's possible, the <b>mould</b> maker modifies directly the <b>mould.</b> The final real geometry of the <b>mould</b> does not coincide with the one of the original CAD model. The aim {{of this paper is to}} define a procedure, based on Reverse Engineering methods, to reconstruct and to update the mathematical model of the <b>mould</b> after it has been polished and fit. The procedure was tested on a <b>mould</b> for the production of a camera body. A zone of the <b>mould</b> was manually polished and an aesthetical change, not included in the original CAD model, was introduced on it directly. The <b>mould</b> was digitized with an optical system based on structured light and the point clouds were treated with a software for the reconstruction of the surfaces.

40|$|The {{classical}} <b>moulds</b> {{which are}} currently used for forming the soles {{directly on the}} uppers, allow obtaining one sole model. One <b>mould</b> for each foot is made, {{and at least one}} <b>mould</b> for each size number in the size number series. To manufacture one single sole model in the sizes series an average set of 16 <b>moulds</b> are needed. Changing the model implies the entire production of a new set of <b>moulds.</b> Therefore, a large diversification of the soles requires the manufacturing a quantity of <b>moulds</b> sets equal with the quantity of sole models. In this paper are presented solutions to obtain more cavity shapes in the same <b>mould,</b> through the use of modular interchangeable pieces. The <b>moulds</b> with versatile cavities have the same functional characteristics as the <b>moulds</b> with unique cavities, are usable on the same type of machines and can be used independently or together with the classical <b>moulds.</b> A brief analysis on the technological processes for manufacturing <b>moulds</b> with versatile cavities reveals a significant lowering of the manufacturing time for <b>moulds</b> in which will be obtained other sole models. This {{is due to the fact}} that some of the <b>mould</b> parts are reused. In conclusion, the producers that chose this type of <b>moulds</b> can launch on the market new models in a shorter time and at lower prices. ...|$|R
40|$|During <b>mould</b> {{design phase}} {{different}} approaches are envisaged to materialize part production {{and they must}} be evaluated not only in technological criteria, but also in an economical perspective.
