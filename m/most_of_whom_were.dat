5|$|By {{the end of}} August 1915, about 150 Armenians with Russian {{citizenship}} were deported from Constantinople to holding centers. A few of the detained, including writer Alexander Panossian (1859–1919), {{were released}} the same weekend before even being transferred to Anatolia. In total, {{it is estimated that}} 2,345 Armenian notables were detained and eventually deported, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> not nationalists and did not have any political affiliations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the elections, a CH-53E {{helicopter}} crashed near Al-Rutbah on 26 January, killing all 31 Marines and sailors, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> members of 1st Battalion 3rd Marines and who had survived the Second Battle of Fallujah. This was the single deadliest incident for US troops in the Iraq War.|$|E

The nation is dominated by its ethnic Bamar (or Burman) majority (68%), <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>are</b> Buddhist.|$|R
5|$|Royalist {{casualties}} were high, with 600 killed, including Stewart, and 900 taken prisoner. This defeat prevented Charles from relieving the defenders in Chester, which {{fell to the}} Parliamentarians on 3 February 1646. Charles instead withdrew with approximately 2,400 remaining cavalry, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> destroyed by Poyntz's ambush at Sherburn-in-Elmet on 15 October 1645.|$|E
5|$|With the two {{remaining}} guns removed to Fort Corcoran for storage and the garrison sent home, the fort was left abandoned. Due to its proximity to Washington and the large influx of freed blacks to the city that followed {{the end of the}} Civil War, the fort became residence to many squatters, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> African-American.|$|E
5|$|Agagianian {{was born}} Ghazaros Aghajanian on September 18, 1895 {{in the city}} of Akhaltsikhe, in the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire—in present-day Samtskhe-Javakheti {{province}} of Georgia. At the time, around 60% of city's 15,000 inhabitants were Armenians. His family was part of the Catholic minority of Javakhk Armenians, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> followers of the Armenian Apostolic Church. His ancestors came from Erzurum {{in the aftermath of a}} Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829. Fleeing Ottoman persecution, they sought refuge in the Russian Caucasus. He lost his father, Harutyun, at an early age.|$|E

5|$|Although an {{extremely}} competent administrator, there were reservations within the New Zealand government following Godley's appointment as {{commander of the}} division. Allen, although publicly supportive of Godley, privately believed an alternative commander should be found after the division completed its training. Godley was a distant and remote divisional commander, not popular with most soldiers of his command. He also favoured the professional officers of the NZEF, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> seconded from the British Army, over those drawn from the Territorial Force.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} dignitaries {{who lived in}} Chadderton's manor houses, Chadderton's {{population}} during the Middle Ages comprised a small community of retainers, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> occupied in farming, either growing and milling of grain and cereal or raising cattle, sheep, pigs and domestic fowl. Workers supplemented their incomes by hand-loom spinning and weaving of wool at home. The community was ravaged by an outbreak of the Black Death in 1646.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, in 1939, the International Secretariat was moved to New York City. The resident International Executive Committee failed to meet, largely because of a struggle in the U.S. Socialist Workers Party (SWP) between Trotsky's supporters and the tendency of Max Shachtman, Martin Abern and James Burnham. The secretariat was composed of those committee members {{who happened to be}} in the city, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> co-thinkers of Shachtman. The disagreement centred on the Shachtmanites' disagreements with the SWP's internal policy, and over the FI's unconditional defence of the USSR.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{was inaugurated}} as {{president}} of Jefferson College on September 27, 1845. During his tenure, he also pastored a church {{in the city of}} Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. College administration apparently did not suit him, however. A student uprising against the president and the faculty occurred in 1846, hastening the end of his short stay at the school. A desire to see his children, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> living with relatives scattered throughout Kentucky and Virginia, also factored into his decision to resign his post in 1847. On his resignation, he was awarded an honorary LL.D from the school.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 Russian émigrés met {{regularly}} at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, Stepney. Many {{of its members}} were not anarchists, and the club became a meeting and social venue for the Russian émigré diaspora, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> Jewish. The small group of Latvians who {{became involved in the}} events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists—although anarchist literature was later found among their possessions. Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice.|$|E
5|$|During a {{televised}} address on 20 April, Nixon announced {{the withdrawal of}} 150,000 U.S. troops from South Vietnam during the year. This planned withdrawal implied restrictions on any offensive U.S. action in Cambodia. By the spring of 1970, MACV still maintained 330,648 U.S. Army and 55,039 Marine Corps troops in South Vietnam, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> concentrated in 81 infantry and tank battalions. Many of them, however, were preparing {{to leave the country}} or expected to leave in the near future and would not be available for immediate combat operations.|$|E

The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as {{outlined}} in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings killed at least 129,000 people (<b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> civilians) and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in the history of warfare.|$|E
5|$|Galleys were {{effective}} as troop transports for amphibious operations, but were severely under-gunned, especially {{in relation to}} their large crews; a galley with a 250-man crew, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> rowers, would typically carry only one 24-pounder cannon and two 6-pounders, all in the bow. The galleys also lacked decks and adequate shelter for the rower-soldiers, many of whom succumbed to illness as a result of exposure during the war of 1741–43.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} winter after the dedication, {{soldiers}} practiced flying and servicing aircraft in subzero weather conditions. More than 1,000 workers, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> hired from outside Alaska, {{worked on the}} project through 1941. Despite these outside workers, the construction effort caused unemployment to almost vanish in Fairbanks, causing a large demand for labor. Fairbanks' economy grew, and the city's second/www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=178> radio station, KFAR, began broadcasting on October 1, 1939. Hangars and base buildings were completed in summer 1941, but the second winter of cold-weather testing was interrupted by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|E

5|$|On 7 August the Greater Bairam (a feast day {{celebrating the}} end of the Islamic year) coincided with the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani being ordered to move out with {{supplies}} for the advancing troops, but 150 men, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> past {{the end of}} their contracts and entitled to be discharged, refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their rations and saddle up. One man was hit about the head with the butt of a pistol and the dissenters were dispersed into small groups and reassigned to various units in the infantry division; the 52nd (Lowland) Division.|$|E
