Given the significant complexity of the vectorial optical phenomena associated with subwavelength structures, the correct interpretation of SNOM acquisitions requires a complete and accurate understanding of the intrinsic image-formation procedure. In this theoretical study, we show that the SNOM imaging process with uncoated tapered fiber probes is highly polarization dependent and that the dominant effect is, surprisingly, the choice of optical fiber from which the tapered probe was fabricated. We demonstrate that although a tapered <b>monomode</b> <b>fiber</b> is unable to collect the component of the vector electric field parallel to the tip axis, a tapered multimode fiber can successfully collect all the three field components.

40|$|Abstract. The {{elongation}} sensor bases on {{the contrast}} measurements in an unbalanced fiber optic Michelson interferometer with a 3 × 3 coupler and a semiconductor multimode laser. For 1 -m long sensor we obtained 5 -mm measuring range with ± 28 -m uncertainty. 1. PRINCIPLE OF SENSOR OPERATION A {{new kind of}} the elongation sensor exploits the contrast phenomenon in the unbalanced Michelson interferometer (Fig. 1). Light from the source is coupled into <b>monomode</b> <b>fiber</b> and amplitude divided into measuring and reference arm by the 3 × 3 coupler. The two guided beams are reflected by the mirrors, recombined again and mix coherently to produce interference observable at the outputs. The irradiance observed at a detector {{as a function of}} the measurement arm elongation can be written as: I(l) ∝ IO[1 + V (l) · cos(2 (l)) ] (1) whereV is the contrast of the interferometer and is the phase difference between beams. The contrast describes the amplitude of the interference output irradiance and derives from a source spectrum. It is known, that a laser with one frequency mode gives the exponential dependence of the contrast, while for multimode lasers the contrast oscillates within the envelope determined by one mode contrast dependence. When a number of laser modes increases, the higher gradient of slope is observed [1]. Th...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{our contribution}} to defme an optical dynamic sensor. Given that the studies carried out are of an exploratory nature, {{the first task}} was to validate the mechanical behavior of the specimen body in the sensor and to check that the signals recorded were reproducible. To subject the sensor to deformation rates of 10 to 102 per second, tests were carried out using the KOLSKY-HOPKINSON apparatus. The results show that specimen body responds in a satisfactory manner. It remains within the elastic zone for the loads exerted and {{this is consistent with}} the results of the sizing calculations carried out.
