Acid rains, frequent in years 1980 and 1990 affected the area, though their destructive effect was not as powerful as in the lower zones. In some parts, especially around Mały Szyszak mountain meadows cover the large areas, used in 19th {{and in the first}} half of the 20th centuries as <b>mountain</b> <b>pasture</b> areas. This has come to a standstill, although some traces of those activities, as old shepherd huts, can still be found; some of them have been converted into mountain huts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{name for}} the common <b>mountain</b> <b>pasture</b> in most Scandinavian {{languages}} derives from the Old Norse term setr. In (Norwegian) the term is sæter or seter; in (Swedish) säter. The place name appears in Sweden in several forms as Säter and Sätra, and as a suffix: -säter, -sätra, -sätt and -sättra. Those names appear extensively over Sweden with a centre in the Mälaren basin and in Östergötland. The surname [...] "Satter" [...] is derived from these words.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt is {{essential}} for grass livestock farming to cope with climate variability and, particularly, drought. A potential solution is to use collective <b>mountain</b> <b>pastures,</b> which are colder and wetter, in the summer. However, there is little knowledge on such collective pasture management. Therefore, we surveyed three collective sheep summer <b>mountain</b> <b>pastures</b> and three small and one large cattle summer <b>mountain</b> <b>pastures</b> in 2012 in the Auvergne region, France. Farmers using and managing the pastures were interviewed. We also analysed regional statistics, an economic report and a shepherd journal. Our results show that drought has incited farmers to use collective pastures. Beginning and ending dates of the summer grazing season and animal transfers have been modified by collective decisions and individual farmer strategies. We conclude that collective summer <b>mountain</b> <b>pastures</b> is a unique source of flexibility for livestock farming...|$|R

2500|$|To help acquire {{water rights}} in 1905, Eaton made high offers to {{purchase}} land in Owens Valley. Eaton's eagerness aroused suspicion {{in a few}} local Inyo County people. Eaton bought land as a private citizen, hoping to sell it back to Los Angeles at a tidy profit. Eaton claimed {{in an interview with}} the Los Angeles Express in 1905 that he turned over all his water rights to the City of Los Angeles without being paid for them, [...] "except that I retained the cattle which I had been compelled to take in making the deals ... and <b>mountain</b> <b>pasture</b> land of no value except for grazing purposes". Eaton moved to the Owens Valley to become a cattle rancher on the land he purchased. Eaton always denied that he acted in a deceptive manner.|$|E

60|$|I {{saw that}} this was a place of wonders. In a sea turn or shallow fog while I was there the next summer, it being clear overhead, the edge of the bank twenty rods distant, {{appeared}} like a <b>mountain</b> <b>pasture</b> in the horizon. I was completely deceived by it, and I could then understand why mariners sometimes ran ashore in such cases, especially in the night, supposing it to be far away, though they could see the land. Once since this, being in a large oyster boat two or three hundred miles from here, in a dark night, when there was a thin veil of mist on land and water, we came so near to running on to the land before our skipper was aware of it, that the first warning was my hearing the sound of the surf under my elbow. I could almost have jumped ashore, and we were obliged to go about very suddenly to prevent striking. The distant light for which we were steering, supposing it a light-house five or six miles off, came through the cracks of a fisherman's bunk not more than six rods distant.|$|E

Put into {{the midst of the}} amphitheatre a clear green-and-white torrent, with a church surrounded by a few wooden farmhouses on its slope, and there you have the commune of Les Pentes. But what was most delightful of all was this, that there was no hotel, no pension, not even a regular lodging-house. I was the first stranger to discover the capabilities of the village, and I was free to exploit them for my own private advantage. By a stroke of luck, it so happened that M. Clairon, the richest farmer of the place, with a pretty old-fashioned Vaudois farmhouse, and a pretty, dainty little Vaudoise daughter, was actually willing to take me in for a mere song per week. I jumped at the chance; and the same day saw me duly installed in a pretty little room, under the eaves of the pretty little farmhouse, and with the pretty little daughter politely attending to all my wants.|$|E

30|$|During {{the hard}} years of {{conflicts}} between the PKK and the Turkish army, the <b>mountain</b> <b>pastures</b> of Agri were closed by the army, forcing the Kurdish breeders to change <b>mountain</b> <b>pastures</b> or their livelihoods.
