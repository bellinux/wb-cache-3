5000|$|Spheeris had notable {{disagreements}} with writer Fred Wolf and David Spade {{throughout the entire}} production of the film. Spheeris fired Wolf from the film three times (he was hired back twice by Farley and once by Lorne Michaels), then refused {{to speak to him}} and finally banned him from the set. Her relationship with Spade was equally as tumultuous. Speaking to Farley's official biographer, she said, [...] "I don't think I've ever even smiled at anything David Spade's ever done... I still have a recording of a message David left on <b>my</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine.</b> He said, 'You've spent this whole movie trying to cut my comedy balls off.'" [...] Surprisingly, the two worked together again in the 1998 comedy Senseless.|$|E

40|$|The <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> paradox has {{relatively}} recently sparked {{some debate}} regarding Kaplan’s Demonstrative (1977). A popular approach {{to solve the}} <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> paradox has been to reject Kaplan’s proper context thesis whilst largely maintaining his framework for indexicals. In this thesis I will firstly present two new <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> type cases and argue that the existing solutions to the <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> paradox cannot deal with these cases. Then, I will propose a near-side pragmatic solution to the <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> paradox that adequately deals with these new <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> cases {{in a way that}} adheres with our pre-theoretical intuitions...|$|R
2500|$|Marzipan's <b>Answering</b> <b>Machine</b> is {{a series}} of {{cartoons}} with almost no animation. It features messages from the other characters, being played on the <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> belonging to the character Marzipan. In early episodes, the episode number ended in [...]0 (for example, Marzipan's <b>Answering</b> <b>Machine</b> Version 5.0), but since Marzipan changed to a new <b>answering</b> <b>machine,</b> the number ends in [...]2 (for example, Marzipan's <b>Answering</b> <b>Machine</b> Version 15.2). In every episode, Strong Bad prank calls Marzipan, badly pretending to be someone else, such as [...] "Detective Everybody", [...] "Safety Dan", and sometimes other characters. Although the animation is usually just a picture of the <b>answering</b> <b>machine,</b> sometimes there are short animated segments featuring the characters. As of April 1, 2016, there are 17 Marzipan's <b>Answering</b> <b>Machines.</b>|$|R

He seemed in really good health—{{sometimes}} he wasn't in such good health, sometimes he could barely walk {{because he was so}} fucked up. When he came back from Japan, he left me a couple of messages on <b>my</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine.</b> He sounded completely out of his mind, though not like he was drunk. It was strange, like he'd gone crazy; finally I got hold of someone, and she told me Jeffrey had come back, that he'd been drinking while he was gone, his liver had poisoned his system, and he was experiencing dementia. The hospital turned him away saying, there's nothing we can do for him, his liver's shut down, he's dying. After this, I get a call from him; he was up in Utah and he sounded normal. And I said, what the hell, man, everyone's saying you're going to die. And he said, they always say that. And a week later, he fell into a coma and died.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Increased {{incidence}} of telephone <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> {{and the use}} of such devices to screen calls pose a potential threat to the representativeness of samples in telephone surveys. Using data from nine statewide surveys, this analysis examines the ex-tent to which <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> are used to screen calls and the demographic characteristics associated with answering ma-chine use and call screening. Results show that at most two to three percent of households use <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> to screen calls, and that such screening is more likely to take place in households with higher family incomes, outside rural areas, and which include individuals who are younger and have higher levels of education. While call screening does not presently threaten the representativeness of samples in telephone surveys, the in-creased {{incidence of}} <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> together with the in-creased percentage of households indicating these devices ar...|$|R
