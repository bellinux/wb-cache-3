50|$|Seed stitch (called <b>moss</b> <b>stitch</b> in the UK, Australia, New Zealand etc.) is {{the most}} basic form of a basketweave pattern; knit and purl {{stitches}} alternate in every column ("wale") and every row ("course"). In other words, every knit stitch is flanked on all four sides (left and right, top and bottom) by purl stitches, and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|Part of {{the appeal}} and {{popularity}} of Aran Jumper comes from the array of myths propagated by Heinz Edgar Kiewe. 1. The <b>moss</b> <b>stitch</b> is said to signify an abundance of growth2. The blackberry stitch represents nature. 3. The honeycomb is a {{said to be a}} lucky stitch, signifying plenty4. Lattice or basket stitches to represent the old wicker basket patterns. 5. The Ladder of Life and Tree of Life represent the stages of life.|$|E
50|$|The award {{letter is}} usually {{made in the}} colors and {{initials}} representing the school that the recipient attends. The letter patch is primarily constructed of chenille and felt materials. Standard sizes range from 4 in to 8 in. While 4 in and 5 in usually denote Junior Varsity achievements, 6 in to 8 in would denote full (Senior) Varsity. The stitching style used for creating the chenille look is called a <b>moss</b> <b>stitch,</b> while the outlining sew down is called a chain stitch.|$|E
60|$|Sancho {{also had}} been put in better trim, for, after his master had {{refreshed}} himself with a warm bath, he gave his dog a good scrub while Mrs. <b>Moss</b> set a <b>stitch</b> {{here and there in}} the new old clothes; and Sancho reappeared, looking more like the china poodle than ever, being as white as snow, his curls well brushed up, and his tasselly tail waving proudly over his back.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} texture for a knitted garment is that {{generated}} by the flat stockinette stitch—as seen, though very small, in machine-made stockings and T-shirts—which is worked in the round as nothing but knit stitches, and worked flat as alternating rows of knit and purl. [...] Other simple textures {{can be made with}} nothing but knit and purl stitches, including garter <b>stitch,</b> ribbing, and <b>moss</b> and seed <b>stitches.</b> [...] Adding a [...] "slip stitch" [...] (where a loop is passed from one needle to the other) allows {{for a wide range of}} textures, including heel and linen stitches as well as a number of more complicated patterns.|$|R
2500|$|With Tschopp {{in such a}} prime {{position}} to Wiggins in the general classification, Wiggins' team was doing the lion's share {{of the work in}} the main field; a main field that was struggling to make headway due to the weather conditions. A strong headwind – gusting up to [...] in places – was keeping the speeds of the chase down. The headwinds did claim one victim as Tschopp's team-mate Tejay van Garderen was struck by a falling tree branch on the descent from the reached the Col des <b>Mosses.</b> He received <b>stitches</b> for a wound on his nose, but was forced to abandon the race; he had been lying 17th overall in the general classification, trailing Wiggins by 15 seconds, and had been just four seconds behind countryman Andrew Talansky (...) in the under-25 classification. As the breakaway reached the finish site in Sion for the first of two passings, their advantage was around the two-minute mark over the main field. The leaders split up after the second-category climb to Basse-Nendaz, as Tschopp, Ignatenko and Levarlet left the other three riders behind and set off to try and extend their ever-reducing advantage to the main pack.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the pilling {{degradation}} results is an important decreasing in garment quality and a negative influence on the user’s comfort to wear. There are a lot factors, such as the yarn spinning system, fabric geometry and finishing operation, which affect the pilling performance. This research paper presents the investigation of fabric surface concerning pilling formation, especially knits, influenced by the fibrous composition. As samples were used knitted fabric panels, obtained from carded yarns, with fibers composition like cotton, wool or mixed one. Regarding fabric geometry 3 types were used – single jersey, 2 x 2 rib and <b>moss</b> <b>stitch.</b> In order to establish which of the yarns are most appropriate for knitting garments {{from the point of}} view of pilling resistance were realized tests using the standard SR EN ISO 12945 - 2. The tests were performed with the Nu-Martindale – Abrasion and Pilling Tester, Model 864. For assessment were used two methods – the first one is a comparison with visual standards, tested fabrics or photographs of fabrics, to find the degree of pilling on a scale from 5 (no pilling) to 1 (very severe pilling) and the second one by determination of mass loss percent...|$|E
