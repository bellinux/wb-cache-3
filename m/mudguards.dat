5|$|December 44 Museum, La Gleize, Belgium. A cosmetically {{restored}} Tiger II (production turret) Hull number 280273, {{built in}} October 1944. Turret number 213 from s.SS Pz.Abt 501. Displayed {{at the entrance}} to DECEMBER 44 MUSEUM Collections, a museum devoted entirely to the Battle of the Bulge. This tank was abandoned in La Gleize on 24 December 1944, where the advance of Kampfgruppe Peiper was halted. The front part, about 1/3, of the gun barrel is restored with a Panther gun barrel and muzzle brake. It also has restored <b>mudguards.</b> It is stripped of exterior and internal fittings and most of the torsion bars are broken, but it still has its gearbox and engine in place.|$|E
25|$|Utility {{bicycles}} {{have many}} standard features {{to enhance their}} usefulness and comfort. Chain guards and <b>mudguards,</b> or fenders, protect clothes and moving parts from oil and spray. Kick stands help with parking. Front-mounted wicker or steel baskets for carrying goods are often used. Rear luggage carriers {{can be used to}} carry items such as school satchels.|$|E
25|$|The first Isle of Man TT {{race was}} held on Tuesday 28 May 1907 and was called the International Auto-Cycle Tourist Trophy. The event was {{organised}} by the Auto-Cycle Club over 10 laps of the Isle of Man St John's Short Course of 15miles 1,470yards for road-legal 'touring' motorcycles with exhaust silencers, saddles, pedals and <b>mudguards.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Fordson Model N {{replaced}} the Fordson Model F. It was an improved {{variant of the}} F. Production of the Model N started in Cork in 1927. Production of the Fordson Model N was transferred from Cork to Dagenham in 1933. The Model N featured a 27 HP engine, standard rear fenders (<b>mudguards),</b> a higher voltage ignition system, and optional pneumatic tires. In 1935 power take-off (PTO) was available as an option on the Model N.|$|E
25|$|Externally, the {{differences}} between the Mark A and Mark B Minicar were very subtle. The rear <b>mudguards</b> were slightly smaller but wider to accommodate the wheel movement whilst the storage area behind the rear seats was also enlarged, increasing the cars overall length slightly and changing its rear profile. Beneath the bodywork, there were improvements to the electrics and to the braking system. The hood was also redesigned to provide more head room inside the car.|$|E
25|$|Single-seat {{twin-engine}} fighter aircraft prototype. Two built (L6844 and L6845), can {{be distinguished}} from later production samples by the <b>mudguards</b> above the wheels (Though the first production sample (P6966) had them as well), the exhaust system and the so-called 'acorn' on the joint between fin and rudder. L6844 had a distinctive downward kink {{to the front of}} its pitot tube, atop the tail not seen again in following models. L6844's colour was dark grey and not red, as is often stated. L6844 had opposite-rotation engines, L6845 had the same rotation engines as per production machines.|$|E
5000|$|In modern Indian and Sri Lankan English usage, {{the wing}} {{is called a}} <b>mudguard.</b> However, the term <b>mudguard</b> {{appears to have been}} in use in the U.S. at one point. The American author E.B. White, in an October 1940 Harper's essay [...] "Motor Cars", refers to [...] "...mudguards, or 'fenders' as the younger {{generation}} calls them." ...|$|R

25|$|Some components, {{which are}} often {{optional}} accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on utility bicycles to enhance their usefulness, comfort, safety and visibility. <b>Mudguards,</b> or fenders, protect the cyclist and moving parts from spray when riding through wet areas and chainguards protect clothes from oil on the chain while preventing clothing from being caught between the chain and crankset teeth. Kick stands keep bicycles upright when parked, and bike locks deter theft. Front-mounted baskets, front or rear luggage carriers or racks, and panniers mounted above either or both wheels {{can be used to}} carry equipment or cargo. Pegs can be fastened to one, or both of the wheel hubs to either help the rider perform certain tricks, or allow a place for extra riders to stand, or rest. Parents sometimes add rear-mounted child seats, an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar, or both to transport children. Training wheels are sometimes used when learning to ride.|$|E
500|$|The chassis {{platform}} {{used for}} the C3 Picasso is {{a modified version of}} that in the Citroën C3 and the Peugeot 207, giving it a comparable wheelbase. The reuse of automobile platforms is commonplace, especially for Citroën because the Trnava plant builds the Peugeot 207 and the C3 Picasso. The parent company PSA Peugeot Citroën pools resources and manufacturing for some vehicles, and sometimes rebadges vehicles, combining design teams between two or more brands to create a shared product. The advantage is the designing and testing vehicles at a reduced cost for the participating brands, but creates multiple, identical-looking vehicles for the market, sometimes with minor styling differences. Examples include: the Fiat Scudo, Peugeot Expert and Citroën Dispatch, the Toyota Aygo, Peugeot 107 and Citroën C1, and the Peugeot Partner and Citroën Berlingo. Citroën placed a contractual obligation on the manufacturers to use green materials for the C3 Picasso range. These comprise ≥11% of the [...] of polymers on the vehicle, including the <b>mudguards,</b> parcel shelf and boot carpet. Citroën recommends the vehicle is serviced at least every two years, or at every [...] for petrol models and [...] for the HDi diesel models.|$|E

2500|$|On 23 April 1946, at 12 {{o'clock in}} the central office for inventions, models and makes of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Florence, Piaggio e C. S.p.A. took out a patent for a [...] "motorcycle of a {{rational}} complexity of organs and elements combined with a frame with <b>mudguards</b> and a casing covering the whole mechanical part".|$|E
2500|$|Piaggio filed {{a patent}} for the Vespa scooter design in April 1946. The {{application}} documents {{referred to a}} [...] "model of a practical nature" [...] for a [...] "motorcycle with rationally placed parts and elements with a frame combining with <b>mudguards</b> and engine-cowling covering all working parts", of which [...] "the whole constitutes a rational, comfortable motorcycle offering protection from mud and dust without jeopardizing requirements of appearance and elegance". The patent was approved the following December.|$|E
2500|$|T-72A (Ob'yekt 176) (1979): An {{improved}} {{version of}} the basic T-72 [...] "Ural". Overall, its offensive capabilities {{are similar to the}} basic T-72 [...] "Ural", but it is much better protected. The differences between T-72 [...] "Ural" [...] and T-72A include the searchlight being placed on the right hand side of turret, the TPD-2-49 coincidence optical rangefinder being replaced by the TPD-K1 laser rangefinder, added plastic armour track skirts covering {{the upper part of the}} suspension with separate panels protecting the sides of the fuel and stowage panniers instead of the flipper type armor panels used in T-72 [...] "Ural", the turret front and top being heavily reinforced with composite armour better known by its US codename - [...] "Dolly Parton", provisions for mounting reactive armor, an electronic fire control system, MB smoke grenade launchers, flipper armour mount on front <b>mudguards,</b> internal changes, and a slight weight increase.|$|E
50|$|Frame.The {{frame is}} {{manufactured}} from high-quality steel tube which is electrically welded to resist shock and impact. The steering head {{is mounted on}} ball bearings to provide ease and smoothness of movement. The front <b>mudguard</b> and the integral rear chain and <b>mudguard</b> are built of resin reinforced glass fibre and finished in red to contrast with the white enamel finish of the frame assembly.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame was}} a pressed steel, fully welded design {{with the front}} end {{carrying}} the steering head and the rear end forming the deeply valanced <b>mudguard.</b> The front forks were pressed steel and carried the front <b>mudguard.</b> Front suspension was of the leading link type. Rear suspension was by fully enclosed telescopic dampers. Front and rear brakes were six-inch single-leading-shoe type in full-width hubs. Wheels were 16-inch.|$|R

2500|$|Some road {{racing and}} club cyclists use a fixed-gear bicycle for {{training}} {{during the winter}} months, generally using a relatively low gear ratio, believed to help develop a good pedalling style. In the UK until the 1950s it was common for riders to use fixed-gear bicycles for time trials. [...] The 1959 British 25 mile time trial championship was won by Alf Engers with a competition record of 55 minutes 11 seconds, riding an 84inch fixed-gear bicycle. The fixed-gear was also commonly used, {{and continues to be}} used in the end of season hill climb races in the autumn. [...] A typical club men's fixed-gear machine would have been a [...] "road/path" [...] or [...] "road/track" [...] cycle. In the era when most riders only had one cycle, the same bike when stripped down and fitted with racing wheels was used for road time trials and track racing, and when fitted with <b>mudguards</b> (fenders) and a bag, it was used for club runs, touring and winter training. By the 1960s, multi-gear derailleurs had become the norm and riding fixed-gear bicycles on the road declined over the next few decades. Recent years have seen renewed interest and increased popularity of fixed-gear cycling.|$|E
60|$|He alighted {{from the}} car, and his uncle did likewise. An {{examination}} showed {{that one of}} the <b>mudguards</b> in front had been badly bent, and that a headlight had snapped off, but beyond this, and the windshield, the big touring-car seemed to be undamaged.|$|E

50|$|In the UK it {{is a legal}} {{requirement}} that a motorcycle should be fitted with <b>mudguards.</b> While motorcycles are invariably fitted with <b>mudguards,</b> only touring cycles generally have fully functional <b>mudguards.</b> Some machines can be seen with a stub of a mudguard {{only a few inches}} long, which satisfies the {{legal requirement}}s but does not actually provide any protection from thrown mud and spray.|$|E

Once again, the feedback from market research was that it was still too radical so the lines were simplified and smoothed out to create the Series S3.|$|R
