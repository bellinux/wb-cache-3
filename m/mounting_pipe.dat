40|$|Preheating of air in {{the dryer}} has an {{important}} role in drying process. This experiment discusses the influence of air flow and their temperature on the drying quality of tapioca. This research begins with the assembly of the components of “flash dryer”. The intake of air blower is varied at 0. 094, 0. 085 and 0. 075 m 3 /s, while the air temperature on the water heater is conditioned by 95, 105 and 115 °C. Blower is installed on the “air heater” to supply hot air for drying and also to pust dry powder under the cyclone. In order to collect data of air temperatur, a thermocouple is placed on the <b>mounted</b> <b>pipe</b> of hammer mill and a thermometer is installed the <b>mounted</b> <b>pipe</b> of air heater. The result show that the lowest density of flour is 0. 517 kg/l with the discharge air is 0. 075 m 3 /s and temperature 115 °C. While the highest density of flour is 0. 555 kg/l with the discharge air is 0. 094 m 3 /s and temperature 95 °C...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{transient}} heat transfer from a Pt–Co wire heater inserted into a vertically <b>mounted</b> <b>pipe,</b> through which forced flow subcooled liquid hydrogen was passed, {{is measured by}} increasing the exponential heat input with various time periods at a pressure of 0. 7 MPa and an inlet temperature of 21 K. The flow velocities range from 0. 8 to 5. 5 m/s. For shorter periods, the non-boiling heat transfer becomes higher than that given by the Dittus–Boelter equation due to the transient conductive heat transfer contribution. In addition, the transient critical heat flux (CHF) becomes higher than the steady-state CHF. The effect of the flow velocity and period on the transient CHF heat flux is also clarified...|$|R

40|$|Excavations at {{historic}} sites often {{result in the}} recovery of an abundance of white clay tobacco pipe fragments. There are several theories that explain why large quantities of stem fragments are recovered from sites, however, no systematic {{studies have been done}} to evaluate these theories. The 1999 cultural resources field investigation in Jefferson County, West Virginia uncovered a rural homestead, the Mount Pleasant Site (46 JF 215), as well as an artifact assemblage that includes 171 pipe bowl fragments and 396 stem fragments. To determine if there are patterns that explain how pipe stems were broken, the stem fragments from the site were measured, then compiled in Microsoft Excel?, and statistically analyzed. Pipe stem breakage experiments were conducted on historic reproduction clay pipes to compare to the data of the site. The stem fragments from the experiments were then measured, compiled in Microsoft Access?, and statistically analyzed. The results of the statistical analysis from the <b>Mount</b> Pleasant <b>pipes</b> and the experimental pipes conclude that while pipe stems are liable to accidental breaking, the intentional breaking of stem fragments can be identified by lip and corresponding lip scar breakage patterns which are present in the <b>Mount</b> Pleasant <b>pipe</b> assemblage...|$|R

50|$|The {{speed of}} the French defeat in June 1940 may have come as a shock, but the advent of another war with Germany and of {{resulting}} restrictions on civilian fuel availability had been widely foreseen. In 1939 Peugeot were already investigating the adaptation of petrol/gasoline engines to run on gas created by the controlled burning of charcoal. The technology would prove particularly suitable for the long bodied Peugeot 402 and for the Peugeot DMA light truck. On the car {{it was possible to}} fit the necessary components without excessive modification of the bodywork. A charcoal burning boiler, able to accommodate 35 kg of charcoal, was mounted on a stout platform {{at the back of the}} car. This provided sufficient power for approximately 80 km (50 miles) before more charcoal needed to be taken on board. The controlled burning of the charcoal produced carbon monoxide, known as gazogène, which was captured and transferred in a stout <b>pipe</b> <b>mounted</b> on the outside of the right-hand C-pillar to a roof mounted gas tank. From here another stout <b>pipe</b> <b>mounted</b> on the outside of the right hand A-pillar drew the gazogène down to the engine. Between 1940 and 1944 more than 2,500 Peugeots were equipped with a gazogène fuel system.|$|R

40|$|The {{change of}} pipe natural {{frequencies}} due to added mass effects {{has been investigated}} in two cylindrical horizontal pipes from empty to completely water filled cases with various intermediate partially-filled conditions. The added mass coefficients of the three first vertical and horizontal modes of vibration have been determined with both experimental modal analysis and finite element analysis (FEA) acoustic-structural numerical simulations, which showed good agreement. The vertical and horizontal added mass coefficients present different behaviors {{as a function of}} the water level. Moreover, the pipe cross sectional dimensions determine the magnitude of these effects. For generalization to any pipe size, dependency of the directional added mass coefficients with new vertical and horizontal added mass estimators has been found. These estimators can be used in practical situations with horizontally <b>mounted</b> cylindrical <b>pipes</b> as a reference to predict and quantify air content.
