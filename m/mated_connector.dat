5|$|In all USB connectors, the {{construction}} always {{ensures that the}} external sheath on the plug makes contact with its counterpart in the receptacle before {{any of the four}} connectors within make electrical contact. The external metallic sheath is typically connected to system ground, thus dissipating damaging static charges. This enclosure design also provides a degree of protection from electromagnetic interference to the USB signal while it travels through the <b>mated</b> <b>connector</b> pair (the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair travels in parallel). In addition, because of the required sizes of the power and common connections, they are made after the system ground but before the data connections.

40|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{tool for}} safely separating one multipin electrical connector from another is presented. The separation tool {{consists of a}} master cylinder which operates a pair of slave cylinders. Each slave cylinder has a corresponding operative shaft and an extraction tab. The slave cylinders are spaced apart from one another {{so that they may}} be positioned on either side of <b>mated</b> <b>connector</b> pairs of different sizes and so that their extraction tabs may be slid between the connectors. When the master cylinder's plunger is operated, its operation is hydraulically transmitted to the operative shafts of the slave cylinders which extend outward and, once pressed against a substrate, causes the slave cylinders and corresponding extractor tabs to move away and separate one connector from the other. A second preferred separation tool includes an additional pair of extractor tabs, one {{at the end of each}} operative shaft, so that the tool can be used to separate a <b>mated</b> <b>connector</b> pair hanging in free space...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDeep-sea {{electric}} and optical connections {{can often be}} problematic. Several manufacturers propose wet-mateable connectors based on integrated valve systems but the complexity and precision needed to reach the required reliability result in high cost. We are therefore developing {{a new type of}} tooling for connecting cheap standard wet-mateable connectors under oil in deep sea water pressure conditions. Complexity is delocalised from the connector to the easily recoverable and reparable tooling. The cost of wet connections is consequently expected to be drastically reduced, with reliability enhanced. The tooling contains 2 carriers sliding on a linear stage together with a second perpendicular stage intersecting the line between the carriers. The carriers and linear stages are enclosed in a clam-shelled oil-fillable volume. Each half of the connector to be mated is fixed to its respective carrier in a ROV operation. The waterproof caps of the two connectors automatically attach to the third carrier on the perpendicular stage. Seawater around the connectors is replaced with non-conductive oil, and both halves of the connector are detached from their sealing caps, which are then moved sideways to allow the connector to be mated under oil. The clamshells are then opened, allowing the <b>mated</b> <b>connector</b> to be removed by the ROV. A reverse capping procedure is applied for disconnection...|$|E

40|$|Photovoltaic modules have no {{moving parts}} and last upwards of 25 years with no {{maintenance}} aside from occasional cleaning. The installation of modules in building facades and other structures has necessitated {{the use of}} push fit connectors to enable quick and easy inter-module DC electrical connection. New applications for photovoltaics such as roof shingles (tiles) place further performance demands on connectors. The day-night variation in temperature within a PV roof for example, creates component expansion. This paper details the behaviour of a tin plated copper photovoltaic connector under small amplitude fretting tests (10 - 100 ?m) using a specially developed accelerated lifetime test rig. The <b>mated</b> <b>connector</b> creates a high force, multiple point contact between {{the male and female}} components by the use of a prestressed spring collar. The study shows that a transition amplitude exists (~ 13 ?m) above which gross slip at the connector interface appears to occur. This causes a gradual linear increase in contact resistance, followed by a sudden change to rapid wearing of the tin plating on both the connector surfaces and spring collar, leading to connector failure. Below the transition amplitude, partial slip at the connector interface is observed which creates a stable, low contact resistance. The paper highlights the need to maintain a partial slip/stick condition within a PV connector for long term contact resistance stability. The implication of this requirement for photovoltaic connector design and application is discussed, considering the benefits of flexible connector housings and lubricants in particular...|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} tubes, {{like the}} Deforest Spherical Audion from c. 1911, used the typical light bulb Edison socket for the heater, and flying leads {{for the other}} elements. Other tubes directly used flying leads for all of their contacts, like the Cunningham AudioTron from 1915, or the Deforest Oscillion. Type C6A xenon thyratrons, used in servos for the U.S. Navy Stable Element Mark 6, had a mogul screw base and L-shaped stiff wires at the top for grid and anode connections. <b>Mating</b> <b>connectors</b> were machined pairs of brass blocks with clamping screws, attached to flying leads (free hanging).|$|R
50|$|The term {{jackscrew}} is {{also used}} for the captive screws that draw the two parts of D-subminiature electrical connectors together and hold them mated.

These small jackscrews may have ordinary screw heads or extended heads (also making them thumbscrews) that allow the user's fingers to turn the jackscrew. Furthermore, the head sometimes has an internal female thread, with the male externally threaded screw shaft extending from that.

40|$|Humans {{are able}} to pump gas into a car {{with little or no}} difficulty. This task is {{characterized}} by two sources of force: that from the nozzle contacting the car and that from the hose attached to the pump. The task succeeds due to the appreciable skill of a human and a forgiveness in the connection. The robotic <b>mating</b> of <b>connectors</b> burdened by forces from sources like the gas hose is beyond the current state of art. The research presented in this dissertation develops technology for robots to <b>mate</b> <b>connectors</b> that concurrently experience appreciable forces from encumbrances, like those from hoses, cables and oscillating masses, in addition to forces from contact. Effective force guided assembly under the influence of these bias forces, requires the differentiation of contact forces from bias forces, a task that is impossible using traditional sensing configurations.
