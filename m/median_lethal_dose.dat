5|$|The <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD50) for acute {{radiation}} exposure is about 4.5Sv. The {{committed effective dose}} equivalent 210Po is 0.51µSv/Bq if ingested, and 2.5µSv/Bq if inhaled.

The actual toxicity of 210Po is lower than these estimates because {{radiation exposure}} that is spread out over several weeks (the biological half-life of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose.

The short- and long-term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water-soluble, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD50) between 10 and 100mg/kg.

Studies on rats show a <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD50) as low as 180mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human toxicity data is unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight, and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.|$|E

Excess neurotransmitter activity leads to clinical manifestations of envenomation, although the precise mechanisms {{are not well}} understood. Acetylcholine release accounts for neuromuscular manifestations, and norepinephrine release accounts for the cardiovascular manifestations. Female redbacks have an average of around 0.08–0.10mg of venom, and experiments indicate that the <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD50) for mice at room temperature is 10–20% of this quantity (0.27–0.91mg/kg based on {{the mass of the}} mice used), but that it is considerably more deadly for mice kept at lower or higher temperatures.

This requires trained personnel {{and is not}} the optimum route for stimulating a mucosal immune response. Microencapsulation of vaccine antigens offers a number of advantages over traditional vaccine formulations, including stability without refrigeration {{and the potential for}} utilizing less invasive routes of administration. Recombinant protective antigen (rPA), the dominant antigen for protection against anthrax infection, was encapsulated in poly-L-lactide 100 -kDa microspheres. Alternatively, rPA was loosely attached to the surfaces of microspheres by lyophilization. All of the microspheric formulations were admin-istered to A/J mice with a two-dose schedule by either the intramuscular route, the intranasal route, or a combination of these two routes, and immunogenicity and protective efficacy were assessed. An intramuscular priming immunization followed by either an intramuscular or intranasal boost gave optimum anti-rPA immunoglobulin G titers. Despite differences in rPA-specific antibody titers, all immunized mice survived an injected challenge consisting of 103 <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of Bacillus anthracis STI spores. Immunization with microencapsulated and microsphere-associated formulations of rPA also protected against aerosol challenge with 30 <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of STI spores.

40|$|Saxitoxin and its derivatives, the paralytic {{shellfish}} toxins (PSTs), {{are known}} to be toxic to humans, and maximum permitted levels in seafood have been established by regulatory authorities in many countries. Until recently, the mouse bioassay was the reference method for determining the levels of these toxins in seafood, but this has now been superseded by chemical methods of analysis. The latter methods are able to determine the levels of many PSTs in shellfish, but for risk assessment an estimate of the relative toxicities of the individual components of the PST mixture is required. The relative toxicities are expressed as "Toxicity Equivalence Factors" (TEFs). At present, TEFs are based on relative specific activities in the mouse bioassay, rather than on acute toxicity determinations, as measured by <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> (LD 50 s).

5|$|Caesium {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic. Like rubidium, caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body, but is significantly larger {{and is therefore}} a poorer substitute. Excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia, arrythmia, and acute cardiac arrest, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources. As such, caesium {{is not a major}} chemical environmental pollutant. The <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD50) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride. Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium, when {{entering}} the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, {{and the rest is}} excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.|$|E

40|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning {{results from}} consumption of seafood naturally contaminated by saxitoxin and its congeners, the paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs). The levels of such toxins are regulated internationally, and maximum permitted concentrations in seafood {{have been established}} in many countries. A mouse bioassay is an approved method for estimating the levels of PSTs in seafood, but this is now being superseded in many countries by instrumental methods of analysis. Such analyses provide data on the levels of many PSTs in seafood, but for risk assessment, knowledge of the relative toxicities of the congeners is required. These are expressed as “Toxicity Equivalence Factors” (TEFs). At present, TEFs are largely based on relative specific activities following intraperitoneal injection in a mouse bioassay rather than on acute toxicity determinations.
