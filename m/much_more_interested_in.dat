His father, Suketaro Nakagawa, was an army medical officer and his mother's name was Kazuko. His family moved shortly after to Iwakune, and then finally to Hiroshima. In 1917, at age 12, Nakagawa's father died, leaving his mother Kazuko a young widow. Soen's younger brother, Tamotsu, died soon after in his early childhood. His mother was forced to work {{to make ends meet}} and educate her young {{children}} herself. It was an unforgiving childhood for Soen. Soen's family was of samurai class, so in his youth he was trained as a samurai. But Soen was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the arts, where at a young age he displayed a gift for poetry.|$|E
25|$|He {{tended to}} dramatize where {{traditional}} novelists narrated; {{he is more}} concerned with the interplay of ideas and opinions than of feelings and emotions; his dramatis personae is more likely to consist of a cast of more or less equal characters than of one outstanding hero or heroine and a host of minor auxiliaries; his novels have a tendency to approximate the Classical unities, with few changes of scene and few if any subplots; his novels are novels of conversation rather than novels of action; in fact, Peacock is so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> what his characters say to one another than in what they do to one another that he often sets out entire chapters of his novels in dialogue form. Plato's Symposium is the literary ancestor of these works, by way of the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus, in which (as in much of Peacock) the conversation relates less to exalted philosophical themes than to the points of a good fish dinner.|$|E

Jean-Baptiste Colbert, <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> colonization than Mazarin, was now in power in King Louis XIV's court, and he applied pressure to the Knights to sell. In 1665, the Knights sold their colony to the newly formed Compagnie des Indes occidentales.|$|E

Edward grew up very mild-mannered. Although {{expected}} to become an expert in business, Edward showed <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> music and became a bard. When Golbez's Red Wings attack Damcyan and kill his beloved Anna, Edward joins Cecil's group in their fight against Golbez. He falls overboard when Leviathan attacks Cecil's ship {{on the way to}} Baron, and is tended to in Troia. From his room, he plays the Twin Harp, sending out a melody which aids Cecil's group in defeating the Dark Elf. He joins the airship fleet against the Giant of Babel, and helps to rebuild Damcyan after Zemus' defeat, ultimately becoming its king.|$|R

He chose to work on the project as he wanted make his next film in the United States, and signed on as its director in February 1979. Parker met with De Silva in Manhattan, New York, where it was decided that he would draft his own script with Gore receiving sole screenwriting credit and Parker's colleague Alan Marshall being enlisted as a producer. Gore travelled to London, England, where he and Parker began work on a second draft script. Their new script became significantly darker than what De Silva had originally intended. De Silva said, [...] "I was really motivated and interested in the joy of what the school represented for these kids, and [...] was really <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> where the pain was in going to the school, and so we had our little conflicts based on that area." ...|$|E

He was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> story and character." [...] For inspiration in constructing the film's sets, Webber and van Os studied the works of Vermeer and other artists of the period, such as Gerard ter Borch. Set designer Todd van Hulzen said {{the goal was to}} [...] "... reflect that quiet, sober, almost moralizing ethos that you see in Dutch paintings." [...] They built Vermeer's house on one of Luxembourg's largest film soundstages, a three-story set where they designed rooms that were meant to convey a lack of privacy. According to van Os, the film was about [...] "being observed," [...] so they intended Griet to always feel that she was being watched. In addition, they built two other interior sets to represent the homes of Griet and van Ruijven– Griet's home possessed Calvinistic characteristics while van Ruijven's contained mounted animals to reflect his [...] "predatory nature." [...] The Mauritshuis museum made a high resolution photograph of the actual painting, which was then shot on a rostrum camera {{to be used in the}} film.|$|E
50|$|During {{the decade}} after the {{planting}} of the Normanby trees, Council continued to report the encouragement, and practical assistance, given to individuals and community organisations wanting to plant more street trees. In 1917 the Milton and Rosalie Improvement Association had submitted a request to Council for the planting of avenues of trees along Baroona Road and Nash Street. During 1921, the Town Council reported planting 147 trees. Furthermore, Tait reported that the residents are taking <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the beautification of the Town, and already we have two streets in which trees are to be planted by the residents themselves. And for 1923, Tait reported that the many small reserves and little gardens about the Town are looking well and do credit to our gardener, Mr Jolly. During 1924 the community planted trees along Mary, Moreton and Castlemaine Streets.|$|R

[...] Massive Black's artists {{were allowed to}} use their imagination while developing Fred, but the one stipulation Vicious Cycle made from the beginning was Fred's head—the developers {{wanted it to be}} a liquid-filled jar with the detective's brain and eyes floating around inside. [...] Massive Black came up with several different versions of Fred, including some with guns, which lead designer Adam Cogan had already decided the game would not include. [...] After receiving the sketches, Vicious Cycle chose several that portrayed Fred with a squat, childlike appearance that retained some of the youthful focus of the scrapped Geo project. [...] The publisher, D3, decided to present all of the concept art to a test group. [...] To the developers' surprise, the test group was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> a darker, more intimidating portrayal of Fred than the cartoonish, playful look they had chosen. [...] The developers decided to flesh out the concept and took the chosen sketches back to Massive Black. [...] This time the art came back darker, with similarities to Dirty Harry and The Matrix and The Evil Dead, and a Norman Rockwell-inspired look that would influence the game's art style towards a more violent theme.|$|E
500|$|The Marsh {{family is}} {{spending}} Stan's ninth birthday {{at a public}} aquarium in Denver. As the Marshes enjoy interacting with the trained bottlenose dolphins, Japanese armed with spears suddenly storm the dolphinarium and kill all the dolphins. The Japanese perform similar attacks at several other aquariums, and at an NFL game, where they kill members of the Miami Dolphins football team. Stan asks his friends Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny to help him take on the cause of saving the dolphins and whales from the Japanese. Kyle declines, feeling they can't change Japan's views on the issue. Cartman and Kenny are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> playing the video game Rock Band, professing they [...] "don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales". Eventually, Butters (who is also too busy) informs Stan about the television show Whale Wars, stating that they can take volunteers to help them. Seeing this as his chance, Stan takes Butters' advice and joins host Paul Watson and his crew aboard the Sea Shepherd, but is underwhelmed by their method of throwing [...] "stinky butter" [...] at Japanese whalers {{in an effort to}} deter them. After the Japanese whalers kill Watson with a harpoon, Stan destroys their ship by igniting their fuel barrels with a flare gun. Stan becomes the new captain and leads a more successful campaign in impeding the Japanese whaling effort by employing more aggressive methods. The crew ends up getting interviewed by Larry King, who describes Paul Watson as an [...] "incompetent media whore" [...] and questions Stan on his intentions of increasing ratings with violence. Stan dismisses the charge and contends he is only interested in saving the whales, not ratings.|$|E
500|$|Two {{years of}} {{kindergarten}} were offered, beginning at age four, and students progressed through to first grade {{with other students}} their age. The Cottage School was free to all students, and was supported both by Coonley's own resources and funds raised by the Kindergarten Education Association. The Association, of which Coonley was president, promoted new educational ideas and raised money to help support them. In 1915, John Dewey and his daughter Evelyn featured the Cottage School in their book, The Schools of To-Morrow, which examined how progressive {{schools around the country}} put new educational ideas into action. They were especially struck by how prominently nature featured in school life, noting that they have, for example, a rare bird that is as much a personality in school life as any of the children, and the children, having cared for him and watched his growth and habits, have become <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> wild birds. In the backyard is a goat, the best liked thing on the place, where the children have raised him from a little kid; and they still do all the work of caring for him. The Deweys held the Cottage School as an example of training in good citizenship, commenting on its mock elections, self-government, and public service: [...] "The school organized by the pupils into a civic league has made itself responsible for the conditions of the streets in certain portions of town, and is not only cleaning up but trying to get the rest of the town interested in the problem." [...] The teaching of English was also noted, as it was not taught as a separate subject but as part of history lessons, journal-keeping, and other exercises. Dewey wrote, [...] "The emphasis is put on helping the child to express his ideas; but such work provides ample opportunity for the required drill in the mechanics of writing." ...|$|E
40|$|Discovering {{communities}} can promote {{the understanding of}} the structure, function and evolution in various systems. Overlapping community detection in poly-relational networks has gained <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> recent years, {{due to the fact that}} poly-relational networks and communities with pervasive overlap are prevalent in the real world. A plethora of methods detect communities from the poly-relational network by converting it to mono-relational networks first. Nevertheless, they commonly assume different relations are independent from each other, which is obviously unreal to real-life cases. In this paper, we attempt to relax this strong assumption by introducing a novel co-ranking framework, named MutuRank. It makes full use of the mutual influence between relations and actors to transform the poly-relational network to the mono-relational network. We then present a novel GMM-NK (Gaussian Mixture Model with Neighbor Knowledge) algorithm incorporating the impact from neighbors into the traditional GMM. Experimental results both on synthetic networks and the real-world network have verified the effectiveness of MutuRank and GMM-NK...|$|R
