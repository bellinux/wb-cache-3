40|$|Abstract: The recent {{solar minimum}} of 2009 {{has been studied}} in depth due to the unusual quiet {{activity}} that governed the heliosphere throughout this A < 0 cycle (where the solar magnetic field points inward and outward in {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres respectively). As a result of these quiet conditions, the highest ever proton spectrum was observed by PAMELA in December 2009. By using an advanced steady state 3 D model of the heliosphere, combined with accurate PAMELA observations, the modulation of galactic protons is studied over a period of four years leading up to the end of 2009. In successfully reproducing a set of four PAMELA monthly averaged proton spectra, it was found that proton mean free paths had to increase at low rigidities in order to account for the significant softening in the lower proton spectrum. Moreover, the effects of individual <b>modulation</b> <b>processes,</b> such as diffusion and drifts, are also studied. Consequently, the relative contributions that these processes delivered to the total increase in proton intensities are identified, from which we conclude that all <b>modulation</b> <b>processes</b> indeed played varying but important roles in the observed proton intensities during the 2009 minimum...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} interest in the possibility for tsunami radar remote sensing, owing to the effects of tsunami-induced changes on the propagation of short sea waves. Well before microwave radars, HF radars have been investigated to detect tsunamis (Barrick, 1979). But so far {{there has been}} no system proposed with an appropriate alert real-time mode, the effort being stressed on wind wave and sea surface study. Alternatively, the potential use of Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radar technology has been suggested based on recent observations of <b>modulation</b> <b>processes</b> in radar echoes, which indicates the possibility for the short wind waves to be affected by the tsunami (Troïtskaya and Ermakov, 2005). In fact, when a tsunami reaches the continental shelf, the induced currents that are mostly depth-uniform greatly increases in speed (maybe up to 10 - 20 cm/s) and can induce significant Doppler shifts in ocean surface waves, particularly for those of smaller wavelength in the submetric ranges (high frequency). However, the identification and quantification of short-wave <b>modulation</b> <b>processes</b> in response to an incoming tsunami are very challenging. This is partly because some of these modulations can be related to wind-wave interactions, short-wave/short-wave interactions as well as long-wave /short-wave interactions. In order to investigate the short-wave <b>modulation</b> <b>processes</b> induced by an incoming tsunami, we propose here to use a numerical approach based on a high-order spectral (HOS) method to model fully nonlinear short gravity waves (down to metric length scales) in the presence of unsteady large-scale depth and current fields. Such current and depth fields can be obtained for selected case studies, e. g., from tsunami propagation modeling, using a standard long wave model. This paper presents initial results of this modeling study, in terms of Doppler shifts and wave shoaling/refraction caused by a slowly varying depth-uniform current. The numerical results are then compared with large-scale laboratory results from a wave-current interaction experiment, which has been performed in the FIRST basin (La Seyne, France) ...|$|R

Passband transmission is typically utilized in wireless communication and in bandpass filtered channels such as POTS lines. It also allows for frequency-division multiplexing. The digital bit stream is converted first into an equivalent baseband signal, {{and then to a}} RF signal. On the receiver side a demodulator is used to detect the signal and reverse the <b>modulation</b> <b>process.</b> A combined equipment for modulation and demodulation is called a modem.|$|E
50|$|The next {{development}} in stylus form came {{about by the}} attention to the CD-4 quadraphonic sound <b>modulation</b> <b>process,</b> which requires up to 50 kHz frequency response, with cartridges like Technics EPC-100CMK4 capable of playback on frequencies up to 100 kHz. This requires a stylus with a narrow side radius, such as 5 µm (or 0.2 mil). A narrow-profile elliptical stylus is {{able to read the}} higher frequencies (greater than 20 kHz), but at an increased wear, since the contact surface is narrower. For overcoming this problem, the Shibata stylus was invented around 1972 in Japan by Norio Shibata of JVC, fitted as standard on quadraphonic cartridges, and marketed as an extra on some high-end cartridges.|$|E

It is known from our previous work that the efficiency of DSA depends on the shape of electron spectra incident on the TS, which in turn depends on the spectral shape of the very local interstellar spectrum. <b>Modulation</b> <b>processes</b> also influence the efficiency of DSA. We find that TS accelerated electrons can make contributions throughout the heliosphere to intensity levels, especially at lower energies. An interesting result is that increases caused by DSA at the TS are comparable in magnitude to electron intensity enhancements observed by Voyager 1 ahead of the TS crossing. These intensity increases are large enough to account for observed intensity peaks, and thus supports the view that DSA is involved in their production. Additionally, the energy spectra observed by Voyager 1 throughout the heliosheath are reproduced satisfactorily, {{as well as the}} PAMELA spectrum at Earth at higher energies. We also find that an increase in the rigidity dependence of the diffusion coefficients for these low-energy electrons seems required to reproduce the spectral shape of observed modulated spectra in the heliosheath at kinetic energy E < ~ 4 MeV. This is different from intermediate energies where rigidity independent diffusion explains observations satisfactory. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
