5|$|On February 16, 2004, Fonda led a <b>march</b> <b>through</b> Ciudad Juárez, with Sally Field, Eve Ensler {{and other}} women, urging Mexico to provide {{sufficient}} resources to newly appointed officials helping investigate {{the murders of}} hundreds {{of women in the}} rough border city. That same year, she served as a mentor to the first all-transgender cast of The Vagina Monologues.|$|E
5|$|Pittsburgh {{citizens}} {{helped to}} defuse the threat by banishing three men whose intercepted letters had given offense to the rebels, and by sending a delegation to Braddock's Field that expressed support for the gathering. Brackenridge prevailed upon the crowd to limit the protest to a defiant <b>march</b> <b>through</b> the town. In Pittsburgh, Major Kirkpatrick's barns were burned, but nothing else.|$|E
5|$|The French {{army was}} forced to <b>march</b> <b>through</b> rain and black {{coal-dust}} mud to reach Waterloo, and then to contend with mud and rain as it slept in the open. Little food was available for the soldiers, but nevertheless the veteran French soldiers were fiercely loyal to Napoleon.|$|E

5|$|Alice again laid {{claim to}} the regency. However, most Antiochene lords {{remained}} hostile {{to the idea of}} a female ruler and sent envoys to BaldwinII's successor, Fulk of Anjou, who was Alice's brother-in-law. Alice made an alliance with Joscelin II, Count of Edessa, and Pons, Count of Tripoli, in early 1132. Fulk had to travel to Antioch by sea, because Pons did not allow him to <b>march</b> <b>through</b> the County of Tripoli. Fulk landed at St. Symeon where the Antiochene barons acknowledged him as regent. He appointed Reynald I Mazoir, Constable of Antioch, to administer the principality.|$|E
5|$|As the Koreans were {{preparing}} their defensive {{positions on the}} dusk of November 25, the two Chinese corps were mobilizing for a decisive counterattack against the Eighth Army's right flank. The PVA 38th Corps planned to attack in full force against the ROK 7th Infantry Division's center and right flank, while two divisions from the 42nd Corps started to <b>march</b> <b>through</b> the hills in order to bypass the ROK 8th Infantry Division's right flank. Given {{the importance of this}} assault, Han Xianchu, one of Peng's deputies, personally commanded the 38th and 42nd Corps {{for the rest of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the Egyptian police controlling the Sinai Peninsula had withdrawn, leaving the area largely unprotected. In February 1915, a German and Ottoman force unsuccessfully attacked the Suez Canal. Minor Ottoman and Bedouin forces operating across the Sinai continued to threaten the canal from <b>March</b> <b>through</b> the Gallipoli Campaign until June, when they practically ceased until the autumn. Meanwhile, the German and Ottoman Empires supported an uprising by the Senussi (a political-religious group) on the western frontier of Egypt which began in November 1915.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines (1/7) {{also tried to}} break the Chinese {{blockade}} at Hill 1419 on 1 December. Despite being badly reduced by combat, hunger and frostbite, the PVA 59th Division sent in its last five platoons and refused to yield. As night approached, 1/7 finally captured the peak and started to <b>march</b> <b>through</b> the hills {{on the east side}} of the road. Relying on the element of surprise, they managed to destroy several Chinese positions along the road. On the morning of 2 December, a joint attack by Fox Company and 1/7 secured the Toktong Pass, thus opening the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri.|$|E
5|$|Basic {{training}} {{began at}} Wallgrove on 1 August, and {{was provided by}} experienced regular soldiers and personnel who had previously served in the Militia. In mid-August the battalion moved to Ingleburn, {{and by the end}} of the month individual training had been completed. Collective training followed, and on 5 October the battalion took part in a divisional <b>march</b> <b>through</b> Sydney. A further move came in November when the 2/18th was transported to Bathurst, where more complex exercises were undertaken, including at brigade and divisional levels.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>march</b> <b>through</b> {{vineyards}} and cornfields, the emaciated children ate {{as much as}} they could. Lukić {{states that}} the Partisans rested the remaining children at Žumberak for a day, before arranging for them to be transferred across the Kupa river into liberated areas of the Bosanska Krajina. According to one survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, some of the children who were liberated from the camp by the Partisans inAugust 1942 were placed with families in the Žumberak district and were subsequently re-captured by the Ustaše. Some were killed and others were returned to the camp.|$|E

5|$|In March 2012, {{hundreds}} of anti-nuclear demonstrators {{converged on the}} Australian headquarters of global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. The 500-strong <b>march</b> <b>through</b> southern Melbourne {{called for an end}} to uranium mining in Australia, and included speeches and performances by representatives of the expatriate Japanese community as well as Australia's Indigenous communities, who are concerned about the effects of uranium mining near tribal lands. There were also events in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Margot Kidder as Lois Lane: A {{reporter}} at the Daily Planet, who becomes a romantic interest to Clark Kent. The producers and director had a very specific concept for Lois: liberated, hard-nosed, witty and attractive. Kidder was cast because her performance had a certain spark and vitality, and because of her strong interaction with Christopher Reeve. Over 100 actresses were considered for the role. Margot Kidder (suggested by Stalmaster), Anne Archer, Susan Blakely, Lesley Ann Warren, Deborah Raffin and Stockard Channing screen tested from <b>March</b> <b>through</b> May 1977. The final decision was between Channing and Kidder, with the latter winning the role.|$|E
5|$|Norman {{lies within}} Tornado Alley, {{the region of}} the United States where tornadic {{activity}} is most frequent. The city has a tornado season lasting from <b>March</b> <b>through</b> June, with over 80% of all reported tornadoes occurring during these months. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area, including Norman, is the most tornado-prone area in the United States. As recently as May 10, 2010, a tornado outbreak occurred in southeastern Norman that resulted in the loss of multiple homes and businesses. On April 13, 2012 Norman was struck by a weak tornado. On May 6, 2015, the northwestern part of Norman was hit by a weak tornado.|$|E

5|$|On 24 March the French army retreated through Brussels. Dumouriez {{began calling}} in his {{detachments}} such as Harville's corps. At this point Dumouriez opened {{negotiations with the}} Austrians. He offered to evacuate Belgium if his armies were allowed an unmolested retreat. The terms were accepted and the French armies withdrew to camps behind the border. The Army of Holland was allowed to <b>march</b> <b>through</b> enemy lines and took position near Lille. The Army of the Ardennes was posted at Maulde, the Army of the North at Bruille-Saint-Amand, and the Army of Belgium at Condé-sur-l'Escaut and Valenciennes. Geertruidenberg was evacuated on 2 April and Breda on 3 April.|$|E
5|$|Since 1 June 1998, station {{commanders have}} served as aides-de-camp to Her Majesty the Queen. The station {{received}} the Freedom of Entry to the London Borough of Hillingdon on 11 May 2000. This allowed military personnel to <b>march</b> <b>through</b> the borough in full uniform, an honour granted by the council in light of 2000 being the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Britain and the 85th anniversary of the opening of RAF Northolt. The neighbouring RAF Uxbridge station had received the same honour in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The allies invaded Paraguay in April 1866, {{but after}} initial success, their advance {{was blocked by}} fortifications at Humaitá and along the Paraguay River. Porto Alegre had {{remained}} behind, leading the 2nd Corps and guarding Rio Grande do Sul. Mitre, no longer on Brazilian territory and acknowledged as the allied commander-in-chief, planned to use Porto Alegre's army to <b>march</b> <b>through</b> Paraguayan territory from the rear to surround Humaitá. As {{a result of a}} suggestion by Tamandaré—though Mitre had not issued orders for the move—Porto Alegre boarded his army onto Brazilian ships and instead brought them up to the positions occupied by the other allied troops.|$|E

5|$|The gay {{community}} of San Francisco had a longstanding {{conflict with the}} San Francisco Police Department. White's status as a former police officer intensified the community's anger at the SFPD. Initial demonstrations took place as a peaceful <b>march</b> <b>through</b> the Castro district of San Francisco. After the crowd arrived at the San Francisco City Hall, violence began. The events caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars' worth of property damage to City Hall and the surrounding area, as well as injuries to police officers and rioters.|$|E
5|$|A {{short period}} of home leave followed, before the battalion's {{personnel}} concentrated at Royal Park for a <b>march</b> <b>through</b> Melbourne. A draft of reinforcements arrived around this time also, incorporating men from New South Wales and several others states. In mid-September, the battalion moved to Greta, New South Wales, travelling by rail through Shepparton, Tocumwal and Newcastle. A brief period of training was undertaken there, during which the battalion's khaki uniforms were dyed green. During this time, the battalion was re-organised and converted to the jungle establishment; {{as part of this}} process its authorised strength was reduced to around 800 personnel of all ranks. The situation in the Pacific had deteriorated dramatically, and the Australian forces holding out against the Japanese in New Guinea were hard-pressed and desperately in need of reinforcement. Thus in early October 1942, not more than two months after returning to Australia, the 2/5th moved to Brisbane, Queensland, where it deployed to Milne Bay, which had only recently been held {{in the face of a}} Japanese landing, aboard the Dutch transport Maetsuyker.|$|E
5|$|After {{disembarking}} in Sydney, {{the troops}} received {{three weeks of}} leave during which time {{they were allowed to}} return to their homes. The 9th Division then carried out welcome home marches across Australia, with the 2/15th taking part in the <b>march</b> <b>through</b> Brisbane. After this, the division was transported to Kairi on the Atherton Tableland in north Queensland where it was converted to the jungle establishment and began training for operations against the Japanese. The reorganisation saw the battalion establishment drop to around 800 men, and the loss of many vehicles and heavy equipment. Lieutenant Colonel Colin Henry Grace was appointed to command the battalion in May 1943 and would do so {{for the rest of the}} war. Amphibious training was carried out at Trinity Beach, near Cairns, with the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment in July 1943.|$|E
