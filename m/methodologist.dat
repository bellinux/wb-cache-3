40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the debate surrounding}} the elucidation of Laka-tosian novel facts in Keynesian macroeconomics. An analysis of this debate highlights how, {{in the process of}} using methodologies to appraise economics, economic <b>methodologists</b> have been forced into adopting the methodology of historiographic research programmes (MHRP) as a method of appraising methodologies. It is argued here that the failure to find Lakatosian novel facts in Keynesian macroeconomics has prompted economic <b>methodologists</b> to consider the appropriateness of MHRP as a method of meta-methodological appraisal. This paper suggests that the failure to find Lakatosian novel facts in economics must necessarily lead economic <b>methodologists</b> into a Kuhnian-type investigation of what it is that economists actually do. Keynesian macroeconomics, Lakatos, novel facts, rational reconstructions, meta-methodology, Kuhnian analysis,...|$|R

40|$|Case study {{methodology}} {{has long}} been a contested terrain in social sciences research which is characterized by varying, sometimes opposing, approaches espoused by many research <b>methodologists.</b> Despite being one of the most frequently used qualitative research methodologies in educational research, the <b>methodologists</b> do not have a full consensus on the design and implementation of case study, which hampers its full evolution. Focusing on the landmark works of three prominent <b>methodologists,</b> namely Robert Yin, Sharan Merriam, Robert Stake, I attempt to scrutinize the areas where their perspectives diverge, converge and complement one another in varying dimensions of case study research. I aim to help the emerging researchers in the field of education familiarize themselves with the diverse views regarding case study that lead to a vast array of techniques and strategies, out of which they {{can come up with a}} combined perspective which best serves their research purpose...|$|R
40|$|A {{controversy}} in the mixed methods community concerns the existence of core characteristics of the field. The authors believe that contemporary characteristics exist, which will evolve as advances in the research field emerge. The authors discuss four characteristics and issues related to them. Methodological eclecticism describes mixed <b>methodologists</b> as connoisseurs of methods who expertly employ qualitative/ quantitative techniques in their toolbox. Pedagogical and practical issues are considered {{in terms of how}} mixed <b>methodologists</b> are trained to conduct research. The second characteristic, paradigm pluralism, rejects the “incompatibility thesis ” that had linked theoretical with methodological traditions. The authors contend that more than one paradigm can underlie mixed methods and discuss this further. The section on an integrative, cyclical approach to research discusses the contexts of justification and discovery and their interrelationship. The final characteristic is a set of research designs and analytical processes that were developed by mixed <b>methodologists</b> and distinguish it from other traditions...|$|R

40|$|Prior to 2004, {{the design}} and {{development}} of collection functions at Statistics New Zealand (Statistics NZ) was done by a centralised team of data collection <b>methodologists.</b> In 2004, an organisational review considered whether {{the design and}} development of these functions was being done in the most effective way. A key issue was the rising costs of surveying as the organisation moved from paper-based data collection to electronic data collection. The review saw some collection functions decentralised. However, a smaller centralised team of data collection <b>methodologists</b> was retained to work with subject matter areas across Statistics NZ. This paper will discuss the strategy used by the smaller centralised team of data collection <b>methodologists</b> to support subject matter areas. There are three key themes to the strategy. First, {{is the development of}} best practice standards and a central standards repository. Second, is training and introducing knowledge sharing forums. Third, is providing advice and independent review to subject matter areas which design and develop collection instruments...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the survey {{environment}} has been rapidly changing, creating new opportunities and new challenges for survey <b>methodologists.</b> These include: relatively low response among all contact modes and designs; the rapid replacement of landline telephones for mobile and smart phones; the integration of new and different types of data for sampling and new sampling methods; the use of different survey interview modes; how to study behaviors and opinions about sensitive topics; {{and the development of}} survey designs for experts and opinion leaders. All have implications for data quality and for our ability to consistently and reliably answer substantive and theoretical questions about politics and society. Obviously, a comprehensive survey of how survey <b>methodologists</b> are advancing new approaches to deal with this vast array of challenges and opportunities is not possible in a mini-symposium in Political Analysis. Nevertheless, in this Mini-Symposium on Advances in Survey Methodology, we include five papers that focus on new directions that survey <b>methodologists,</b> especially those working in political science, are developing in response to the changing environment...|$|R

40|$|Positivism dominates {{research}} in U. S. political science. I {{will show that}} even though critical realism is virtually unknown in the discipline, realist concepts have {{found their way into}} debates among qualitative <b>methodologists.</b> The analysis begins with a juxtaposition of positivist and realist foundations. Next, I will trace the methodology debate that has unfolded in the U. S., examining in what ways it reflects these foundational assumptions. Over the last number of years, I demonstrate, qualitative <b>methodologists</b> have engaged in philosophical hybridity, because they have drawn on realist concepts while continuing to adhere to an empiricist ontology. This kind of cherry-picking is a perilous strategy, and I suggest that <b>methodologists</b> examine their ontological assumptions, especially their views on causation. To do so, they need to engage critical realism. This exercise would benefit political science, because it would provide scholars with exciting new research possibilities. Moreover, critical realism is well-suited to support the discipline’s central quest: gaining insight into the world by using few examined cases to draw inferences to larger sets of unexamined cases...|$|R

40|$|Applied Cognitive Psychology {{seeks to}} publish the best papers, in any area of specialization, that combine {{cognitive}} theory and application. One area, the cognitive aspects of survey methodology (CASM) movement, started 20 years ago (Jabine, Straf, Tanur, 2 ̆ 6 Tourangeau, 1984) as an “attempt to build a bridge between deep interdisciplinary chasms” (Tanur, 1992, p. ix), has sought to strengthen collaborations between survey <b>methodologists</b> and cognitive psychologists {{for the benefit of}} both fields. To survey <b>methodologists,</b> theories and observations of cognitive psychology can be applied in reducing “response errors. ” To applied cognitive psychologists, applying cognitive, communicative, and memory principles to problems in survey methodology has the potential to advance cognitive theory. But during the past 20 years, the discipline of applied cognitive psychology simply has not exerted an appropriate level of influence, nor reaped a sustained level of rewards, in its association with the CASM movement. As Wright and Loftus (1998) have pointed out, most of the CASM effort is devoted, by design, to the benefit of survey methodology. “But this is really a two-way street. We should be asking what benefits cognitive research … can achieve from this collaboration” (p. 467). Echoing a similar theme, Tanur (1999) has asked “why is the preponderance of CASM-related research … neither guided by nor feeding back into cognitive theory” (p. 17) ? Both survey <b>methodologists</b> and applied cognitive psychologists share responsibility in nurturing a mutually beneficial dialogue. For their part, survey <b>methodologists</b> have not been as responsive as they could be regarding the potential role that applied cognitive psychology can assume in their work. At the same time, applied cognitive psychologists have not been as knowledgeable as they should be concerning the interesting and relevant work that survey <b>methodologists</b> are conducting. The extent to which CASM researchers and applied cognitive psychologists are lacking in their appreciation and knowledge of each other, works to the detriment of both their fields...|$|R

40|$|One way of {{inducing}} economists to {{pay more}} attention to methodology is for <b>methodologists</b> to take up problems that practicing economists will see as relevant to their work and discuss them in a non-technical manner. The paper provides some examples of how <b>methodologists</b> could aid practicing economists in this way. The examples used are the validity of the new classical's insistence on reductionism, the tension between those who want to ground economic theory rigorously, and those willing to work with informal theory, and the related tension between the claimed reliance on 'scientific' theory and the actual reliance on informal evidence, conflicting interpretations of what science and theories are, and some low-level but important problems in econometrics. ...|$|R
