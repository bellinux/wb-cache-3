2500|$|The NMR signal {{observed}} {{following an}} initial excitation pulse decays with time due to both spin relaxation and any inhomogeneous effects which cause different spins {{in the sample}} to precess at different rates.

[...] Examples of inhomogeneous effects include a magnetic field gradient and a distribution of chemical shifts. If the inversion pulse is applied after a period t of dephasing, the inhomogeneous evolution will rephase to form an echo at time 2t.

In order to specify the states of the system, i. e. the different spin configurations, the ground state phase diagram is obtained on the (H/|J|, D/|J|) plane corresponding to the reduced external magnetic and crystal fields, respectively. As a result, the thermal change of the order-parameters, the <b>magnetisations</b> belonging to the two sublattice system, was investigated to obtain the full phase diagrams of the system on the (H/|J|, kT/|J|) planes. The behavior of the order-parameters with respect to the external magnetic field was also studied for the given values of D/|J|. Besides the interesting thermal and external magnetic field change of the sublattice <b>magnetisations,</b> the system also exhibits interesting critical behaviors including first- and second-order phase transitions, therefore, triciritical points and the reentrant behavior.

2500|$|Oxygen {{molecules}} {{have attracted}} attention {{because of the}} relationship between the molecular magnetization and crystal structures, electronic structures, and superconductivity. Oxygen is the only simple diatomic molecule (and one of the few molecules in general) to carry a magnetic moment. This makes solid oxygen particularly interesting, as it is considered a 'spin-controlled' crystal that displays antiferromagnetic magnetic order in the low temperature phases. For papers dealing with the magnetic properties of solid oxygen we refer to <b>magnetisation</b> of condensed oxygen under high pressures and in strong magnetic fields by R.J. Meier, C.J. Schinkel and A. de Visser, [...] J. Phys. C15 (1982) 1015–1024, far infrared absorption dealing with the magnetic excitations or spinwaves in Meier R J, Colpa J H P and Sigg H 1984 J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys. 17 4501. At very high pressures, solid oxygen changes from an insulating to a metallic state; and at very low temperatures, it even transforms to a superconducting state. Structural investigations of solid oxygen began in the 1920s and, at present, six distinct crystallographic phases are established unambiguously.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the protein}} is {{labelled}} with carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 {{it is possible}} to record triple resonance experiments that transfer <b>magnetisation</b> over the peptide bond, and thus connect different spin systems through bonds. This is usually done using some of the following experiments, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH. All six experiments consist of a 1H-15N plane (similar to a HSQC spectrum) expanded with a carbon dimension. In the HN(CA)CO, each HN plane contains the peaks from the carbonyl carbon from its residue as well the preceding one in the sequence. The HNCO contains the carbonyl carbon chemical shift from only the preceding residue, but is much more sensitive than HN(CA)CO. [...] These experiments allow each 1H-15N peak to be linked to the preceding carbonyl carbon, and sequential assignment can then be undertaken by matching the shifts of each spin system's own and previous carbons. The HNCA and HN(CO)CA works similarly, just with the alpha carbons (Cα) rather than the carbonyls, and the HNCACB and the CBCA(CO)NH contains both the alpha carbon and the beta carbon (Cβ). Usually several of these experiments are required to resolve overlap in the carbon dimension. This procedure is usually less ambiguous than the NOESY-based method, since it is based on through bond transfer. In the NOESY-based methods additional peaks corresponding to atoms that are close in space but that do not belong to sequential residues will appear, confusing the assignment process. Following the initial sequential resonance assignment it is usually possible to extend the assignment from the Cα and Cβ {{to the rest of the}} sidechain using experiments such as HCCH-TOCSY, which is basically a TOCSY experiment resolved in an additional carbon dimension.|$|E

To invert the relationship between model parameters and observables (<b>magnetisations</b> and correlations) mean-field approximations are often used, allowing to determine model parameters from data. However, all known mean-field methods fail at low temperatures with the emergence of multiple thermodynamic states.

40|$|Artificial Spin Ice (ASI), {{comprised}} of ferromagnetic nanobars in a honeycomb geometry, attracts much attention {{since it is}} a directly imageable frustrated system which exhibits rich physics including ice-rule behaviour and magnetic monopole excitations. ASI’s nanobars undergo domain wall mediated magnetic reversal in external fields. Understanding and indeed controlling the trajectories of field driven domain walls and hence {{the order in which}} ASI’s nanobars are reversed is a crucial step towards mapping out ASI’s full functionality for potential applications. In this thesis, trajectories of domain walls during the early stages of ASI’s magnetic reversal are studied. Data showing domain walls executing non-random walks in the transverse domain wall regime and random walks in the vortex domain wall regime is presented. The former behaviour is linked to the domain wall’s chirality, and as such, attempts to control a domain wall’s initial chirality via triangular injection pads are discussed. In addition, ways in which a vortex domain wall’s chirality may be controlled with ellipsoidal hole obstructions are shown. Artificial Dipolar 2 D-XY, a complementary system to ASI, also promises interesting behaviour. In this new frustrated architecture, individual nanobars are replaced with single domain nanodiscs whose <b>magnetisations</b> can point in any in-plane direction. In this thesis, intriguing results from preliminary experiments on this new system are presented. One of the best techniques used to study the <b>magnetisations</b> of nanostructures such as those described above is Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM).

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the different magnetic results of an electromagnetic induction with proton magnetometer measurements on an archaeological site. The electromagnetic induction allows measuring both the apparent magnetic susceptibility in part per thousand (ppt) and the apparent electrical conductivity in millisiemens (mS/m). A proton magnetometer measures the total magnetic intensity in nanotesla (nT), caused by the induced and remanent <b>magnetisations.</b> An archaeological site where historical documents indicated {{the presence of a}} 13 th century fortress that built by Lamuri Sultanate was selected as a test area. The measurement were conducted by divided the study area into 10 profiles. Some standard data processing have been applied to the measured data. The result of the first survey with electromagnetic induction showed low magnetic anomalies in the buried remains of Lamuri fortress. The similar value are shown as well by low magnetic field intensity in magnetometer measurement...|$|R
