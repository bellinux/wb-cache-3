5|$|It {{may be that}} in the <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols {{were never}} meant {{to be more than a}} nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old épater la bourgeoisie. It may also be that in the <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were meant to be a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E
40|$|In the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the antiglobalization {{movement}} and the anti-American left, and perhaps in the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> Islamic terrorists themselves, {{the growth of the}} American Empire has caused the growth of Islamic terrorism. But in the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the American political and economic elite, and certainly in the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the officials of the Bush administration, the growth of Islamic terrorism has become the cause of the growth of the American Empire. As it happens, both causal theories are probably correct...|$|R

5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between the <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a poet and the <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must {{go out and try}} to help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern Europe, Milica Bakić–Hayden {{developed}} {{the concept of}} Nesting Orientalisms (1992), derived from {{the ideas of the}} historian Larry Wolff (Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on the <b>Mind</b> <b>of</b> the Enlightenment, 1994) and Said's ideas in Orientalism (1978). The Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova (Imagining the Balkans, 1997) presented the ethnologic concept of Nesting Balkanisms (Ethnologia Balkanica, 1997), which is derived from Milica Bakić–Hayden's concept of Nesting Orientalisms.|$|E

5|$|The lyrics {{focus on}} how the bonding of two lovers can become so strong that they {{practically}} become one entity, through the act of sexual intercourse. Apart from the sexual connotations, there is an aspirational undercurrent to the lyrics, and like many of their subsequent songs, desire is explicitly linked to ambition–"Free your <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> doubt and danger/Be for real don't be a stranger/We can achieve it/We can achieve it".|$|E

5|$|After his {{accession}} {{to the throne}} in 1820, King GeorgeIV continued the renovation with the idea in <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace {{with the help of}} his architect John Nash. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by GeorgeIV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of GeorgeIV in 1830, his younger brother King WilliamIV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. After the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Avatar, {{marketed as}} James Cameron's Avatar, is a 2009 American epic science fiction film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron, and {{starring}} Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver. The film {{is set in}} the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi– a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body with the <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection in the <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> the reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) {{falls for}} a new staffer, a blind woman named Jennifer (Maria Thayer). Kenneth cannot bring himself to ask Jennifer out, so Tracy (Tracy Morgan) decides to help him. On their date, at the 30 Rock studios, Kenneth and Jennifer are joined by Tracy—who does all the talking. Jennifer {{believes}} Kenneth is black, but Kenneth reveals he is white and expresses his feeling for her, and admits to her that Tracy was doing all the talking. Jennifer tells him she does not <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> what has happened. However, after feeling Kenneth's face and comparing it to her own, she leaves, horrified at his appearance.|$|E

Nevertheless, both she and Beatrice remained closest to the Queen, and Helena remained close to her mother's side until the latter's death.

5|$|I {{had a lot}} of {{theories}} I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the unconscious <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. we never showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of the unconscious. That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.|$|E

He also indicated the album would be released with a bonus CD that will have all the 'Ill <b>Mind</b> <b>of</b> Hopsin' songs remastered, however this ultimately did not take place. In October 2013, Hospin confirmed that he had finished recording the album and had turned it in to Funk Volume, stating he had personally re-mastered the album 20-30 times to get the sound just right.|$|E
