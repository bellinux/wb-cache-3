We present 206 Pb/ 238 U SHRIMP zircon ages from two ODP Drill Holes and a surface sample from Atlantis Bank on the Southwest Indian Ridge. We report ten new sample ages from 26 - 1430 m in ODP Hole 735 B, and one from 57 m in ODP Hole 1105 A. Including a previously published age, eleven samples from Hole 735 B yield 206 Pb/ 238 U zircon crystallization ages that are the same, within error, overlap with the estimated <b>magnetic</b> <b>age</b> and are inferred to date the main period of crustal growth, {{the average age of}} analyses is 11. 99 ± 0. 12 Ma. Any differences in the ages of magmatic series and/or tectonic blocks within Hole 735 B are unresolvable and eight well-constrained ages vary from 11. 86 ± 0. 20 Ma to 12. 13 ± 0. 21 Ma, a range of 0. 27 ± 0. 29 Ma, consistent with the duration of crustal accretion observed at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. An age of 11. 87 ± 0. 23 Ma from Hole 1105 A is within error of ages from Hole 735 B and permits previous correlations made between zones of oxide-rich gabbros in each hole. Pb/U zircon ages > 0. 5 Ma younger than the <b>magnetic</b> <b>age</b> are recorded in at least three samples from Atlantis Bank, one from Hole 735 B and two collected along a fault scarp to the East.

However, similar progressions of paleomagnetic pole positions have been reported for the Early Triassic Moenkopi Formation in Colorado; thus it appears that long-term variations and swings characterized the geomagnetic field at that time. With detailed paleomagnetic sampling, these features can be utilized for stratigraphic correlation in addition to magnetic-reversal stratigraphy.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{evolution}} of microstructure and magnetic properties in cold deformed, equiatomic FePd during isothermal annealing has been studied. During annealing of the disordered cold deformed FePd at temperatures below the critical ordering temperature, Tc = 928 K (655 ºC), concomitant annealing and ordering (FCC -> L 1 sub 0) reactions take place. The effects of the processing parameters - stored energy of cold work and temperature - on microstructural and property evolution are investigated. The combined solid state reaction (CR) produces complex microstructures that exhibit enhanced magnetic hardness (coercivity) relative to the conventionally processed material. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>age</b> hardening response of the CR processed FePd has been reported. For fully equiaxed polycrystalline microstructures of the ordered FePd phase a correlation between the average grain size and the coercivity has been observed.

50|$|Silicon {{significantly}} {{increases the}} electrical resistivity of the steel, which decreases the induced eddy currents and narrows the hysteresis loop of the material, thus lowering the core loss. However, the grain structure hardens and embrittles the metal, which adversely affects the workability of the material, especially when rolling it. When alloying, the concentration levels of carbon, sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen {{must be kept}} low, as these elements indicate the presence of carbides, sulfides, oxides and nitrides. These compounds, even in particles as small as one micrometer in diameter, increase hysteresis losses while also decreasing magnetic permeability. The presence of carbon has a more detrimental effect than sulfur or oxygen. Carbon also causes <b>magnetic</b> <b>aging</b> when it slowly leaves the solid solution and precipitates as carbides, thus resulting {{in an increase in}} power loss over time. For these reasons, the carbon level is kept to 0.005% or lower. The carbon level can be reduced by annealing the steel in a decarburizing atmosphere, such as hydrogen.|$|R

30|$|Mars’ era of dynamo {{activity}} was discovered when the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft {{dropped to a}} low orbit during an aerobraking manoeuver and recorded quite high levels of crustal magnetization (Acuña et al. 1999). The heavily cratered, older southern highlands exhibit the strongest signals, restricted to the crust; there is no presently operating dynamo {{due to the lack}} of a planetary field detectable from high orbit. The much lower levels of crustal magnetism in the younger, northern planetary hemisphere (100 times smaller according to Whaler and Purucker (2005)), led the discoverers to infer that a dynamo that operated early in Mars’ history up until the early Noachian epoch (for ∼ 0.5 Gyr). Some debate on the validity of this inference ensued until the magnetization of individual crystals in SNC meteorites was measured and the same crystals were dated, showing <b>magnetic</b> <b>ages</b> of 3.9 – 4.1 Ga (Weiss et al. 2002). More recent estimates based on crater counts overlap with the age range 4.1 ± 0.2 Ga (Chassefière et al. 2007) further supporting this conclusion.|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} {{a series of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>aging</b> experiments on single crystals of Dy 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 MnO 3. The results demonstrate striking memory and chaos-like effects in this insulating half-doped perovskite manganite and suggest the existence of strong magnetic relaxation mechanisms of a clustered magnetic state. The spin-glass-like state established below a temperature T-sg approximate to 34 K originates from quenched disorder arising due to the ionic-radii mismatch at the rare earth site. However, deviations from the typical behavior seen in canonical spin glass materials are observed which indicate that the glassy magnetic properties are due to cooperative and frustrated dynamics in a heterogeneous or clustered magnetic state. In particular, the microscopic spin flip time obtained from dynamical scaling near the spin glass freezing temperature is four orders of magnitude larger than microscopic times found in atomic spin glasses.

40|$|We study, {{by means}} of {{magnetic}} susceptibility and <b>magnetic</b> <b>aging</b> experiments, {{the nature of the}} glassy magnetic dynamics in arrays of Co nanoparticles, self-organized in N layers from N= 1 (two-dimensional limit) up to N= 20 (three-dimensional limit). We find no qualitative differences between the magnetic responses measured in these two limits, {{in spite of the fact}} that no spin-glass phase is expected above T= 0 in two dimensions. More specifically, all the phenomena (critical slowing down, flattening of the field-cooled magnetization below the blocking temperature and the magnetic memory induced by aging) that are usually associated with this phase look qualitatively the same for two-dimensional and three-dimensional arrays. The activated scaling law that is typical of systems undergoing a phase transition at zero temperature accounts well for the critical slowing down of the dc and ac susceptibilities of all samples. Our data show also that dynamical magnetic correlations achieved by aging a nanoparticle array below its superparamagnetic blocking temperature extend mainly to nearest neighbors. Our experiments suggest that the glassy magnetic dynamics of these nanoparticle arrays is associated with a zero-temperature spin-glass transition. Comment: 6 pages 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{properties}} of mixed-valence iron phosphate glasses, where there coexist Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + ions, have been investigated. The molar fraction of Fe 3 + {{with respect to}} the total iron ion, [Fe 3 +]/[Fetotal], can be controlled by melting the glass at varied temperatures. Experiments of <b>magnetic</b> <b>aging</b> and memory effects as well as dynamic and static scaling analyses of relaxation time and nonlinear magnetic susceptibility have been performed to get insight into the nature of low-temperature magnetic phase of the glass system. The experimental results reveal that the iron phosphate glasses undergo paramagnet-spin-glass transitions at low temperatures. Temperature dependence of magnetic specific heat suggests that as the temperature is lowered, the magnetic moments start to be frozen at a temperature significantly higher than the spin-glass transition temperature accompanied by a deviation in magnetic susceptibility from Curie-Weiss law. The ratio of the absolute value of Weiss temperature to spin-glass transition temperature increases as the ratio [Fe 3 +]/[Fetotal] becomes larger. This behavior is explainable in terms of the difference in single-ion anisotropy between Fe 3 + and Fe 2 + ions...|$|R

40|$|Dense {{arrays of}} {{magnetic}} nanoparticles contain the physical ingredients {{that are usually}} met in conventional spin-glasses [1]. The unavoidable disorder in the positions and orientations of the particles leads to disorder and frustration of the dipolar interactions between their magnetic moments, which are usually dominant. However, in contrast with “canonical ” spin-glasses, the slow magnetic relaxation introduced by these collective effects coexists and competes with the slow magnetization reversal associated with the anisotropy energy barriers and with the, usually large, distributions of particle’s sizes and shapes. Many experiments performed on dense nanoparticulate materials show phenomena such as the dynamical scaling of the susceptibility [2] and aging [3] that are typical of the spin-glass behaviour. Recent numerical simulations show, however, that <b>magnetic</b> <b>aging</b> is not exclusive of spin-glasses [4]. The question is, then, whether real materials show a true superspin-glass phase. In order {{to address this question}} experimentally, we have compared the magnetization dynamics of well-characterized three- and two-dimensional arrays of magnetic nanoparticles.

First, near-seafloor magnetic anomalies display characteristic sequences of magnetic intensity variations that we confidently identified by comparison with published paleointensity curves for the Brunhes period and used as a dating tool. This approach is further confirmed by the linear trend relating the NRM (Natural Remanent Magnetization) and paleointensity measured on rock samples along the same section.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the Foundation hotspot and the Pacific–Antarctic Ridge (South Pacific) {{is one of the}} two known cases where a ridge is approaching a hotspot. This ridge–hotspot relative movement results in a change in the morphology of the volcanoes along the chain as the age of the lithosphere at the time of edifice formation progressively diminishes. Four hundred kilometers west of the Pacific–Antarctic Ridge axis, volcanism is distributed along two sub-parallel lines of volcanoes, separated by distances diminishing from 100 km at the west to 50 km near the axis of the ridge. The magnetic anomalies mapped on this part of the chain show a pattern clearly dominated by the magnetic signature of the seamounts. The anomalies were forward modeled using a remanent magnetization of normal or reversed polarity within the volcano topography. The resulting pattern of normal and reversed magnetization is consistent with the intervals of the geomagnetic polarity time scale for the last 5 Ma, the age of the oldest studied volcano. These magnetic anomalies therefore represent an independent means of dating the volcanic edifices. The ages deduced from the modeling are consistent with the hypothesis of volcanoes built by a hotspot on the fast moving Pacific plate and are in good agreement with the published radiometric dates, although these dates tend to correspond to the late constructional stages of the edifices. The differences between <b>magnetic</b> and radiometric <b>ages</b> suggest that the average time span to build a volcano of the Foundation chain is about 1 million years, in agreement with other intraplate edifices.

Scattering Q cannot be generally separated from intrinsic Q in the mantle. Forward scattering can generate time-dependent variations in the fre-quency content and complexity of body waves that affect the measurement of t*. Assuming that lateral heterogeneity biases the apparent Q of surface waves, the frequency dependence of Q {{can be explained by}} a relaxation model of intrinsic Q. In this model, Q is constant with frequency up to a cutoff frequency 1 /(2 ~-m) Hz, where ~-m = O. 1 to 0. 2 sec.

Slow- and ultraslow-spreading ridges with spreading rates of G 55 mm/year (1) constitute nearly 60 % of the total length of midocean ridges.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of stellar ages directly impacts {{the characterization of}} a planetary system as it puts strong constraints on {{the moment when the}} system was born. Unfortunately, the determination of precise stellar ages is a very difficult task. Different methods can be used to do so (based on isochrones or chemical element abundances) but they usually provide large uncertainties. During its evolution a star goes through processes leading to loss of angular momentum but also changes in its magnetic activity. Building rotation, <b>magnetic,</b> <b>age</b> relations would be an asset to infer stellar ages model independently. Several attempts to build empirical relations between rotation and age (namely gyrochronology) were made with a focus on cluster stars where the age determination is easier and for young stars on the main sequence. For field stars, we can now take advantage of high-precision photometric observations where we can perform asteroseismic analyses to improve the accuracy of stellar ages. Furthermore, the variability in the light curves allow us to put strong constraints on the stellar rotation and magnetic activity. By combining these precise measurements, we are on the way of understanding and improving relations between magnetic activity, rotation, and age, in particular at different stages of stellar evolution. I will review the status on gyrochronology relationships based on observations of young cluster stars. Then I will focus on solar-like stars and describe the inferences on stellar ages, rotation, and magnetism that can be provided by high-quality photometric observations such as the ones of the Kepler mission, in particular through asteroseismic analyses.
