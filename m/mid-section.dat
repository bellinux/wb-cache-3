500|$|Simpson {{described}} Irresistibles {{material as}} [...] "Mariah Carey meets Britney Spears ... very mature but accessible to teens." [...] She {{said that she}} wanted to blend house, R, pop genres into the record. The opening track, [...] "Irresistible", is an R song with dance-pop influences. It also exhibits elements of pop rock and funk genres, while incorporating latin rhythms. Aside from including a string section, the track features Simpson's breathy vocals, spoken passages and a <b>mid-section</b> breakdown, where her vocals are [...] "funk-fortified". According to author Ben Graham, the lyrics of the song see Simpson stripping her famous virginity image down. Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In gave a similar observation of the lyrics, writing that they point to an imminent sexual compromise. [...] "A Little Bit" [...] is a dance-pop song following the same beat-oriented pattern as [...] "Irresistible". It features piano instrumentation and Simpson sings the lyrics as rapid-fire verses and with start-and-stop hooks. Simpson again adopts breathy vocals, and the lyrics talk about what she expects from her partner: [...] "A little more time, a little less wait / A little more heart, a little less break". The lyrics also demand healthy changes in her relationship. [...] "Forever In Your Eyes" [...] explores elements of Latin music, as the song is backed by Spanish guitar and infused with hip-hop beats. The lyrics describe a couple in love lying together [...] "all through the night". [...] "There You Were" [...] is a torchy power ballad which drew comparisons to Simpson's previous song [...] "Where You Are" [...] (2000). The lyrics of the song are a homage to the protagonist's partner, who changed her life. The song received negative response from critics, with some calling it [...] "sappy" [...] and [...] "unnecessary". [...] "What's It Gonna Be" [...] is a bubblegum pop song influenced by '80s funk music, which was compared to outtakes from Spears' Oops!... I Did It Again (2000). The lyrics deal with Simpson expecting a reply from her lover regarding his fear of commitment.|$|E

However, {{it has also been}} suggested that the disease is mainly genetic. Residents in Karain village were traced from 1990 to 2006. Mineral samples were obtained from stones used in construction of their houses and any fibers present were identified. All women who had moved to the village as brides were traced and their cause of death determined. MM was the cause of death in 52 of 322 villagers, representing 50. 5 % of all deaths. Only 2 of 8 types of stones used in construction contained erionite, and these stones had been used almost exclusively in the <b>mid-sections</b> of the village, where MM was common. In houses not containing erionite, no cases of MM were observed. Sixty-four women came as brides to Karain from villages where erionite or asbestos is not found. Of the 16 women who have died, 11 (69 %) died from MM. The extreme risk of MM in Karain is due to indoor exposure to erionite.

2500|$|X-ray imaging of the Bathers has {{revealed}} that some components of the composition were altered as Seurat’s work on the canvas progressed, while other components were probably not in the painting at all, as he first painted it. The two reclining figures—one {{at the front of}} the image, the other with the straw hat toward the rear—are revealed by the X-ray image to have been among the later concerns for Seurat. The reclining man at the front has had the position of his legs moved to a position more horizontal than that in which they were when first painted. The reclining figure toward the rear is not visible in the X-ray image at all, showing he is a late addition. His posture reflects the altered position of the man in the foreground, raising the suggestion that he was painted in as a compositional response to the alteration made to the man at the front. The skiff and the ferry boat with the tricolor, and the pointillistically applied spots at various locations in the lower <b>mid-section</b> of the painting, are also absent in the X-ray image. A contentious theory suggests that these elements were added by Seurat as a means of making a connection between the Bathers and A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. In spite of their remoteness in the middle distance, the motifs and the seated figures on the boat are present in the later painting, and the ferry boat indeed traverses the river between the Courbevoie river-bank and the île de la Grande Jatte itself.

Non-linear elastic and plastic behaviors dependent on porosity were mathematically described by relevant equation sets.

After applying radiographic inspection, defect morphologies were mapped to the <b>mid-sections</b> of the finite element models and the porosity fraction fields had been generated with interpolation method. ABAQUS input parameters were confirmed by trial simulations to the matrix specimen and comparison with experimental outcomes.

Chord modulus was used to obtain the equivalent elastic stiffness because of the non-linear features.

Soleichthys microcephalus (Günther, 1862) {{occurring}} in warm temperate waters off New South Wales, Australia, is re-described based on examination of a syntype and additional non-type material. This species differs from congeners in its combination of: low meristic features (43 – 45 vertebrae, 71 – 84 dorsal-fin rays, 61 – 71 anal-fin rays, and 81 – 89 lateral-line scales); in having two elongated ocular-side pectoral-fin rays of nearly equal length; with small scales {{present on the}} ocular-side pectoral-fin base and proximal halves of elongated pectoral-fin rays; in its ocular-side pigmentation consisting {{of a series of}} 8 – 10 mostly complete, bold, wide, dark-brown or blackish crossbands of nearly uniform width throughout their lengths and noticeably wider than the alternating lighter-coloured crossbands; and with two, conspicuous, mid-lateral white spots arranged in horizontal series.

[Background]: The {{physiological}} age-related {{decrease in}} circulating IGF-I levels have {{been related to}} cognitive and brain alterations. Therefore, IGF-I is considered a neuroprotective agent. Human IGF-I deficiency is a rare disease associated with poor growth rates, mental retardation and syndromic hearing loss (OMIM 608747). Igf 1 -/- mice are dwarfs with poor survival rates and congenital profound deafness, which worsens with ageing. Our objective was to compare the susceptibility of Igf 1 +/- and Igf 1 +/+ mice to damage by using exposure to excessive noise at different ages. [Methods]: Animals. Igf 1 +/- and Igf 1 +/+ mice were maintained in MF 1 OlaHsd* 129 /Sv genetic bakground. Hearing.

The <b>mid-sections</b> of the cartilage contained more proteoglycans than did either the superficial or the deepest {{portions of the}} cartilage proteoglycans than did either the superficial or the deepest portions of the cartilage. The most superficial 40 micrometer of the cartilage contained relatively more glucosaminoglycans compared with {{the remainder of the}} cartilage. The proteoglycans recovered from the surface 200 micrometer layer contained less chondroitin sulphate, were smaller and almost all of these molecules were able to interact with hyaluronic acid to form aggregates. From about 200 micrometer and down to 1040 micrometer from the surface, the proteoglycans became gradually somewhat smaller, probably owing to decreasing size of the chondroitin sulphate-rich region. The proportion of molecules that were able to interact with the hyaluronic acid was about 90 % and remained constant with depth. The proteoglycans from the deepest layer near the cartilage-bone junction contained a large proportion of non-aggregating molecules, and the average size of the proteoglycans was somewhat larger. The alterations of proteoglycan structure observed with increasing depth of the {{articular cartilage}} beneath the surface layer (to 200 micrometer) are of the same nature as those observed with increasing age in full-thickness articular cartilage.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, <b>mid-sections</b> (n= 24) of the uterine of healthy virgin rats were placed in an organ bath containing carbonated Tyrode’s solution under 1 g tension. The cumulative effects of the aqueous extracts of mango kernel (0. 002, 0. 02, 0. 2, 2, 20, 200, and 2000 μg/mL) or extract vehicle (Tyrode’s solution) in {{the presence or absence of}} atropine were examined by isometric method using the strength, frequency and contractile activity of uterine smooth muscle. Results: The cumulative concentrations (0. 002 - 20 µg/ml) of mango kernel aqueous extract was significantly decreased the strength, frequency and contractile activity of uterine smooth muscle, but the contractile activity was returned to the basal level at the concentrations of 200 and 2000 µg/ml. Atropine (1 µM) could not significantly change the effects of cumulative use of extract on the strength and contractile activity of uterine smooth muscle, but it significantly enhanced the contractile frequency at low concentrations.

This paper reports the validation of the Soxhlet extraction technique by comparison with total dissolution with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The work was carried out for two of the three particle size ranges obtained by grinding the PET flake (300 - 425 and 425 - 700 &# 0956;m) and for the unground flake. Further validation was undertaken by comparison of contaminant levels determined by total dissolution with TFA and sonication with dichloromethane (DCM) using flake ground to the 0 - 300 &# 0956;m size range. The levels of contaminants increased with decreasing particle size range, but X-ray diffraction measurements of degrees of crystallinity were similar for each PET particle size range, thus showing that the differences in contaminant levels were not due to variable percentages of the amorphous material from the tops and bottoms of shredded bottles, relative to the amounts of crystalline PET from the <b>mid-sections</b> of the bottles. Hence, it was postulated that the variations in contaminant levels were due to selective grinding of the more highly contaminated surfaces, whilst the larger particles incorporated the less contaminated interior material. The grinding was also strongly selective with respect to the amorphous flake.

The results address pillar to diameter ratios of some existing caverns {{in the system and}} will represent the final shape of other caverns if they are repeatedly drawn down. This deliverable is performed in support of the U. S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Several three-dimensional models using a close-packed arrangement of 19 caverns have been built and analyzed using a simplified symmetry involving a 30 -degree wedge portion of the model. This approach has been used previously for West Hackberry (Ehgartner and Sobolik, 2002) and Big Hill (Park et al., 2005) analyses. A stratigraphy based on the Big Hill site has been incorporated into the model. The caverns are modeled without wells and casing to simplify the calculations. These calculations have been made using the power law creep model. The four cavern shapes were evaluated at several different cavern radii against four design factors. These factors included the dilatant damage safety factor in salt, the cavern volume closure, axial well strain in the caprock, and surface subsidence. The relative performance of each of the cavern shapes varies for the different design factors, although it is apparent that the enlarged bottom design provides the worst overall performance.

40|$|The {{first part}} of the {{dissertation}} is related to a study of the failure mechanisms of gas metal arc welds. Cost savings can be gained by minimizing the weld length. However, improperly sized welds can result in the loss of structural integrity of the welded components. The necking/shear failure modes for the <b>mid-sections</b> of gas metal arc welds in lap-shear specimens of HSLA steel are investigated. Three-dimensional finite element models were developed with the geometric characteristics of the heat affected zones (HAZ) designed to match the micrographs of the cross sections for the welds. The distributions of the void volume fraction near the welds shown from the finite element analyses are consistent with the failure modes observed in the experiments. Further finite element analyses showed that the geometric characteristics of the HAZ are key factors for the resulting failure location. The mode I and mode II stress intensity factor (SIF) solutions for gas metal arc welds in lap-shear specimens are investigated by the analytical solutions and by finite element analyses. The computational results indicate that the SIF solutions for realistic welds are lower than the analytical solutions for idealized weld geometry. Further finite element analyses were carried out in order to obtain the computational SIF solutions for the realistic weld geometries with dissimilar sheet thicknesses. Finally, three-dimensional computational results indicate that the distributions of the SIF solutions for discontinuous welds are different from those for continuous welds. In the second part, a computational model is developed for simulations of representative volume element specimens of lithium-ion battery modules under in-plane constrained compression tests. The model allows for computational efficiency while simulating the overall mechanical response of battery modules and the deformation patterns of the heat dissipater. The model is based on the properties of the heat dissipater, the foam, and the macro behavior of the cell components. The computational results compare fairly well with the experimental results. Further finite element analyses showed the increase in the initial nominal buckling stress under dynamic loading conditions...|$|R

In 2007, the I- 35 W Mississippi River Bridge collapsed demonstrating significant issues with the safety of older bridges in service. Currently there are so many bridges that are considered structurally deficient that transportation authorities are continuously faced with the dilemma of distributing limited bridge funds. This situation underscores a need for cost effective and reliable maintenance and rehabilitation strategies. This thesis promotes historic preservation in two main tasks: (1) rehabilitation and repair methods are determined to guide engineers, preservationists, and other stakeholders and (2) an assessment is performed for a prototype historic bridge. More specifically, the assessment is performed in three tasks: (1) modeling of the historic bridge, (2) evaluation of the bridge using load rating procedures, and (3) rehabilitation strategies are recommended based on the results of the assessment. The prototype bridge is a 1930 s variable depth T-beam bridge. The bridge did not meet requirements for flexural capacity at the <b>mid-sections</b> of the approach and main span interior girders. Three rehabilitation methods considered were support modification at the cantilever ends, external fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) plies, and external post-tensioning. The support modification raised the bridge to a 75 -year exposure period, the highest level of evaluation, without disrupting the historical integrity of the bridge. The FRP plies raised the positive moment capacity of the bridge to legal load standards, a 5 -year exposure period. The FRP retrofit was limited by de-bonding issues. The external post-tensioning raised the positive capacity to design load standards at the inventory level, a 75 -year exposure period. The external post-tensioning was limited by the use of a straight tendon, but is less visible than a draped tendon. From the information in the assessment, support modification is more effective than the other methods and will not negatively affect the bridge?s historic integrity. Other factors such as the projected effects on other bridge elements including the substructure, cost, installation procedures, and durability should be considered and might lower the benefits of the considered methods...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{response}} and damage evolution of composite materials subjected to underwater explosive loading has been studied. The study utilizes both experimental and numerical techniques {{to aid in}} the understanding of the behavior of these materials under shock loading conditions. The objective of the project is to develop {{a better understanding of the}} response of composite materials when subjected to shock loading conditions leading to more efficiently designed structures. The focus of the work is on performing high fidelity experiments under controlled shock loading and corresponding finite element simulations of the experiments. The work is divided into three phases, each of which build and expand upon the preceding work. ^ In the first phase of the research the transient {{response and}} development of damage mechanisms of E-Glass / Epoxy composite plates is studied. The plates are bi-axial laminates consisting of a non-woven, parallel fiber construction, and are round, flat disks. The work consists of experiments, utilizing a water filled conical shock tube and computational simulations, utilizing the commercially available LS-DYNA finite element code. Two series of experiments have been performed and simulated: (1) a reduced energy series which allowed for the use of strain gages and (2) a series with increased energy which imparted material damage. The strain data obtained from the reduced energy experiments and the corresponding simulations are correlated using the Russell Error measure, a mathematical technique which evaluates the differences in two transient data sets by quantifying the variation in magnitude and phase. It is shown that there is a high level of correlation between the experiments and the simulations when using this measure. Additionally the extent of the damage, including the individual mechanisms, from the high energy experiments and simulations are compared and show good agreement. ^ The objective of the second phase of the project was to increase the geometrical complexity of the composite plates by shifting from flat to curved <b>mid-sections.</b> The plates utilized in the second part of the study are E-Glass / Vinyl Ester, 0 / 90 biaxial laminates. The water filled conical shock tube is utilized to impart shock loading to the plates. Computational finite element simulations are performed with the LS-DYNA finite element code. The transient response of the plates was measured using a three-dimensional (3 D) Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system, which included high speed photography and specialized post processing software. This ultra high speed system records full field shape and displacement profiles in real time. The transient response of the plates is compared to the simulation results using both point-wise time histories as well as full field deformation profiles. The DIC data and the computational results show a high level of correlation using the Russell Error measure. ^ The third phase of the project investigates the relative response of three different laminate constructions. The objective is to determine the effectiveness of the laminate variations on increasing the performance of the laminate used in the second phase. Specifically, to improve the dynamic response and mitigate the damage mechanisms that were observed in the experiments from phases one and two. Three laminate constructions have been investigated: (1) a baseline 0 °/ 90 ° biaxial layup, (2) a 0 °/ 90 ° biaxial layup that includes a thin glass veil between plies, and (3) a 0 °/ 90 ° biaxial layup that has a coating of polyurea applied to the back face. The digital image correlation system is used to capture the real-time deformation and velocity response of the plates. The use of polyurea is shown to improve the material performance, while the inclusion of lightweight veils between the plies is shown to negatively affect the response. ...|$|R
