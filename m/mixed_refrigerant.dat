50|$|While it is cost {{effective}} to liquefy natural gas for storage, transport, and use, roughly 10 to 15 {{percent of the}} gas gets consumed during the process. The optimal process contains four stages of propane refrigeration and two stages of ethylene refrigeration.

Efficiency can be tied to the pure component cascade processes which minimize the overall source to sink temperature difference associated with refrigerant condensing. The optimized process incorporates optimized heat recovery along {{with the use of}} pure refrigerants. All process designers of liquefaction plants using proven technologies face the same challenge: to efficiently cool and condense a mixture with a pure refrigerant. In the optimized Cascade process, the mixture to be cooled and condensed is the feed gas.

Steady-state optimality analysis in dynamic simulation environment was conducted to explore the operational behavior of each cycle. From this analysis, a steady-state optimality map that describes the relation between cost function and decision variable is obtained. By exploring this map a promising optimizing variable is discovered which further {{can be used to}} develop an energy optimizing control structure for the liquefaction process. Despite the same basic working principles, the operational behavior of the three cycles is dissimilar. The DMR has the narrowest optimal operation range while in the MSMR cycle the optimum value of cost function spans in relatively wide range of decision variable. The feasible operation of C 3 MR and DMR is bounded by the suction temperature of <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> compressor while in the MSMR cycle this constraint is inactive.

This contribution focuses on interpreting the geometric pattern of a plot of the temperature difference between the hot and cold composite curves in a cryogenic heat exchanger to understand the profound effects of the flow rates of the individual refrigerant components and the operating pressure on the liquefaction efficiency.

40|$|As the {{worldwide}} energy consumption continues to grow, {{natural gas and}} especially LNG are expected to keep contributing significantly with this growth. More than 95 % of the installed LNG facilities use a precooling cycle as {{the first stage of}} the liquefaction process. In this work, a technical comparison between different precooling cycles for LNG processes is carried out through computational simulations using Aspen HYSYS&# 174;. The aim is to provide future project developments with a clear idea of the technical advantages/disadvantages involved in the selection of the process for the precooling cycle in LNG processes. The precooling circuit is treated as a stand-alone cycle first and then implemented in an entire liquefaction process; the propane precooled <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> (C 3 MR) and the mixed fluid cascade (MFC&# 174;) processes are used for this purpose. The parameters studied are essentially coefficient of performance (&# 946;), heat exchanger UA value, compressor power, suction volumetric flow and pressure ratio. Two cases, cold (6 &# 176;C) and warm (25 &# 176;C) climate conditions are considered for each study. A three stage propane precooled process was found to be the most energetically efficient among the studied cases, even better than a two stage <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> process (C 2 /C 3) for both climate conditions; however, the performance in terms of energy consumption is not the only parameter taken into account and therefore a selection chart is provided. Under warm climate conditions a propane precooling circuit showed to be the most recommended process. For cold climates, however, a two stage <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> cycle reaching ca. - 50 &# 176;C is the preferred alternative, since in this case the low ambient temperature gives the propane precooled process a low share in the entire process.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to model a single <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> process for offshore natural gas liquefaction using ASPEN HYSYS as a simulation tools. The liquefaction process employed in this part {{is a result of}} modification of previous case done by C. W. Remeljeja and A. F. A. Hoadley (2004). This work is divided into two sections. First is to model the PRICO LNG process that published result. Second is to improve the model by adding the mixer in the <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> stream after the separator. It allows two different phase of gas and liquid of <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> to mix together before entering the LNG Heat Exchanger (cold box). The mixer also helps to maintain a constant flow rate of the stream to the cold box. The results are obtained after the system is converged. When modeling the PRICO process in Aspen Hysys,certain variables such as temperature and pressure at the streams entering and leaving the cold box cannot be changed directly. This will cause temperature cross and change of <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> phase in the respected stream. As a result,by doing structural modification on the basic PRICO process specifically in case 3,the load duty of the compressor can be lowered significantly. After three different structural modifications discussed in this paper, the compressor duty to liquefy the natural gas can be reduced down to 82300. 46 kW when compared to the base case. As a conclusion,structural modification in case 3 is the best model when compare case 1 and case 2 because it operates in lowest compressor duty. For the future improvement,a different structure modification can be done using case 3 as a base model,for example replacing the valve with a multiphase expander to generate electricity in this LNG liquefaction process...|$|E

The designed system compresses a mixture of the gaseous refrigerants to a high pressure and then condenses the R- 134 a in a water-cooled separator while the R- 23 remains in vapor phase. The stream of liquid R- 134 a is expanded to the suction pressure and is used to condense the R- 23 that remains in vapor phase, operating much like an inter-stage heat exchanger in a cascade cycle. The condensed stream of R- 23 then expands to the suction pressure and enters a low-temperature evaporator, where it absorbs energy from the load. A model of the cycle is developed based upon first and second law principles of thermodynamics and used to refine the design of a <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> test apparatus.

The evaluations were performed by developing flow sheet models in Hysys in collaboration with HTRI program and literature references. The materials used as design basis for simulation were based on data from Statoil. Based on the simulation results, differential condensation model in Hysys would give a realistic number of about less than 3 % uncondensed vapor (mole fraction) at the outlet of WMR condenser, which may result in higher temperature at design pressure 46. 45 bar or lower pressure at design temperature 22 oC at the outlet of WMR condenser. As a consequence, the specific work would be slightly increased, which means the power efficiency of DMR process would be decreased.

This paper introduces some of the component modules, {{which can be used}} for pure as well as <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerants.</b> Because numerous models can be used for a specific piece of equipment making up the whole refrigerating/heating unit, the Modular Modelling approach leads to a flexible and evolutive structure. A machine can actually be built-up from component libraries that include several types of heat exchangers, compressors and expansion devices and the effects of operating conditions or component geometrical parameters on cycle performance can be examined. Because actual test data are used to "calibrate " the component modules, very accurate results are obtained. The proposed model is validated with experimental results from an air-to-air split unit using R 22 and a water chiller using R 22 and R 407 C. Discrepancies smaller than 5 % are obtained on the cooling duty and COP of the split unit and the chiller components...|$|R
