The PscF protein is {{the main component of}} the Pseudomonas aeruginosa T 3 <b>S</b> <b>needle.</b> Here we demonstrate that PscF, when purified on its own, is able to form needle-like fibers of 8 nm in width and > 1 microm in length.

Knock-out mutants deficient in PscE and PscG are non-cytotoxic, lack PscF, and are unable to export PscF encoded extrachromosomally. Temperature-scanning circular dichroism measurements show that the PscE-PscF-PscG complex is thermally stable and displays a cooperative unfolding/refolding pattern. Thus, PscE and PscG prevent PscF from polymerizing prematurely in the P. aeruginosa cytoplasm and keep it in a secretion prone conformation, strategies which may be shared by other pathogens that employ the T 3 S system for infection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The chlamydial {{developmental}} cycle {{involves the}} alternation between the metabolically inert elementary body (EB) and the replicating reticulate body (RB). The triggers that mediate the interchange between these particle types are unknown {{and yet this}} is crucial for understanding basic Chlamydia biology. Presentation of the hypothesis We have proposed a hypothesis to explain key chlamydial developmental events whereby RBs are replicating strictly whilst {{in contact with the}} host cell membrane-derived inclusion via type three secretion (T 3 S) injectisomes. As the inclusion expands, the contact between each RB and the inclusion membrane decreases, eventually reaching a threshold, beyond which T 3 S is inactivated upon detachment and this is the signal for RB-to-EB differentiation. Testing the hypothesis We explore this hypothesis through the development of a detailed mathematical model. The model uses knowledge and data of the biological system wherever available and simulates the chlamydial developmental cycle under the assumptions of the hypothesis in order to predict various outcomes and implications under a number of scenarios. Implications of the hypothesis We show that the concept of in vitro persistent infection is not only consistent with the hypothesis but in fact an implication of it. We show that increasing the RB radius, and/or the maximum length of T 3 <b>S</b> <b>needles</b> mediating contact between RBs and the inclusion membrane, and/or the number of inclusions per infected cell, will {{contribute to the development of}} persistent infection. The RB radius is the most important determinant of whether persistent infection would ensue, and subsequently, the magnitude of the EB yield. We determine relationships between the length of the T 3 <b>S</b> <b>needle</b> and the RB radius within an inclusion, and between the RB radius and the number of inclusions per host cell to predict whether persistent infection or normal development would occur within a host cell. These results are all testable experimentally and could lead to significantly greater understanding of one of the most crucial steps in chlamydial development. </p...|$|R

40|$|Translocation of {{bacterial}} toxins or effectors into host cells using the type III secretion (T 3 S) {{system is a}} conserved mechanism shared by many Gram-negative pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa injects different proteins across the plasma membrane of target cells, altering the normal metabolism of the host. Protein translocation presumably occurs through a proteinaceous transmembrane pore formed by two T 3 S secreted protein translocators, PopB and PopD. Unfolded translocators are secreted through the T 3 <b>S</b> <b>needle</b> prior to insertion into the target membrane. Purified PopB and PopD form pores in model membranes. However, their tendency to form heterogeneous aggregates in solution had hampered the analysis of how these proteins undergo {{the transition from a}} denatured state to a membrane-inserted state. Translocators were purified as stable complexes with the cognate chaperone PcrH and isolated from the chaperone using 6 M urea. We report here the assembly of stable transmembrane pores by dilution of urea-denatured translocators in the presence of membranes. PopB and PopD spontaneously bound liposomes containing anionic phospholipids and cholesterol in a pH-dependent manner as observed by two independent assays, time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer and sucrose-step gradient ultracentrifugation. Using Bodipy-labeled proteins, we found that PopB interacts with PopD on the membrane surface as determined by excitation energy migration and fluorescence quenching. Stable transmembrane pores are more efficiently assembled at pH 3 ̆c 5. 0, suggesting that acidic residues might be involved in the initial membrane binding and/or insertion. Altogether, the experimental setup described here represents an efficient method for the reconstitution and analysis of membrane-inserted translocator...|$|R

Nanocrystals are synthesized using electrochemical method with the aim to have {{more control over the}} size and shape of the charge transfer salt based on the seed mediated nucleation method. AuNP seeds are prepared on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate by the electrocrystallization method. An aqueous solution of 0. 05 to 1 mM Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (HAuCl 4) with 0. 1 mM (Potassium chloride) KCl as the supporting electrolyte was prepared. The electrodeposition of the AuNPs was monitored by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and analyzed by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The results show that the most dominant factor to control the AuNP size is the HAuCl 4 concentration. Deposition time and applied potential are the other factors controlling the electrodeposition. The smallest particle size was observed with the lowest HAuCl 4 concentration. The synthesis of K 1. 75 Pt(CN) 4. 1. 5 H 2 O rods is conducted according to literature on bare HOPG with a concentration of 0. 07 M of K 2 Pt(CN) 4 in DI water and a potential pulse of 1. 5 V (vs SCE) for 0. 1 <b>s.</b> <b>Needle</b> shaped crystals with a size range of 600 nm to 5 µm in length and 100 - 500 nm in width were synthesized on the bare HOPG.

The results will help to have a better understanding of seed-mediated nucleation theory for producing nanoparticles of the desired size and shape, and also introduce a new way of manufacturing future nanosensors and nanoelectrods. Next, micro sized crystals were synthesized using the same method with longer deposition time on patterned Cr/Au electrodes. The conductivity of the KCP crystals was measured in exposure of different vapors.

Both HIV/AIDS and malaria distribution are currently undergo ing profound changes in Brazil, with mutual expansion to intersec ting geographical regions and social networks. Very recent reports describe the first clinical case of AIDS in a remote Amazonian ethnic group, as well as malaria cases in Rio de Janeiro state (hitherto a malaria-free area for 20 years); in addition, two outbreaks of both infections occurred {{at the beginning of}} the 1990 s in the most industrialized Brazilian state (S??o Paulo), due to the sharing of <b>needle</b> <b>s</b> and syringes by drug users.

We have determined the solution structure of MxiG-N residues 6 - 112 (MxiG-N(6 - 112)), representing the first published structure of this T 3 SS domain. The structure shows strong structural homology to forkhead-associated (FHA) domains. Canonically, these cell-signaling modules bind phosphothreonine (Thr(P)) via highly conserved residues. However, the putative phosphate-binding pocket of MxiG-N(6 - 112) does not align with other FHA domain structures or interact with Thr(P).

Here, we examine the fuel characteristics and ignition potential of Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine) foliage during the early stages of a mountain pine beetle attack. Foliar samples were taken periodically from multiple trees identified as green (healthy, unattacked), recently attacked, or red (dead). The fuel moisture con- tent, chemical composition, and time to ignition of needles from each attack category were quantified. Foliar moisture contents varied by an order of magnitude between the attack categories and were lowest for red needles (� 12 % on average), highest for green needles (� 109 % on average), and most variable for needles of recently attacked trees. Dry matter proportions of fiber in the needles of attacked and red trees were nearly twice that of green needles. Starch and sugar levels were much lower in the needles of attacked and red trees than green trees. Crude fat contents also differed between the attack categories. Time to ignition was strongly related to time since beetle attack. Ignition times varied from as little as 11 <b>s</b> for red <b>needles</b> to 41 <b>s</b> for green <b>needles.</b> A combined model of foliar moisture content, fiber, and crude fat explained 92 % of the variation in the foliar time to ignition.

40|$|Overview. Neurophysiologic {{methods are}} {{used to assess the}} {{functional}} status of the CNS and are important adjuncts to the clinical examination. The electroencephalogram (EEG) records spontaneous electrical activity from the cerebral cortex. Visual, auditory, and somatosensory evoked potentials probe the sensory pathways in the spinal cord, brainstem, subcortical regions, or cerebral cortex. Information concerning motor and sensory pathways in these regions is provided by brainstem reflexes (blink, acoustic, and oculographic). Spinal cord and spinal root function is assessed via somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), electromyography (EMG), and nerve conduction studies (NCS). Somatic reflex studies provide motor and sensory information about specific segments in the arm (C 6) and leg (<b>S</b> 1). <b>Needle</b> EMG is an established method for providing clinically useful and segmentally specific information in radicular disease affecting arms and legs. The major limitation of EMG, however, is that this technique evaluates only the motor component of radicular function and many patients with radiculopathy only exhibit sensory complaints. SEPs are typically elicited by stimulating mixed nerves (median, ulnar, tibial, and peroneal) to assess sensory pathways. Therefore, the application of standard SEPs to study radicular disease is necessarily limited to investigating the lumbar and cervical regions because of the limited number of sites to stimulate. Dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials (DSEPs) involve recording cerebral evoked responses from cutaneous stimulation of areas of known dermatomal innervation providing a pure sensory input to any level of th...|$|R

40|$|As vehicle {{emissions}} {{standards and}} fuel economy constraints become increasingly strict, {{the automotive industry}} must employ the use of advanced engine technologies to overcome these challenges. Fuel injection rate shaping and cylinder deactivation (CDA) are two such technologies, {{and both of them}} require the design and implementation of algorithms using various hardware and software tools. ^ Fuel injection rate shaping is one path towards cleaner and more efficient diesel engines. Piezoelectrically-actuated fuel injectors are well-suited for rate shaping operation, but are difficult to control. Control-related challenges arise primarily {{due to the lack of}} measurements available in a fuel injection system on-engine, the inherent complexity in the dynamics of a piezoelectric fuel injector, and variability from injector-to-injector and over the life of a given injector. Although these challenges are significant, model-based fuel flow rate estimation and control is of the utmost importance due to the fact that the brake torque in a diesel engine is primarily influenced by the total amount of injected fuel per engine cycle. This thesis studies the effect of injector model parameter uncertainties on the model-based estimate of the injector 2 ̆ 7 s output fuel flow rate. Specifically, the relationship between the injector 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>needle</b> seat area and needle lift is investigated. While off-engine experiments can be conducted to determine this parameter, this study presents an on-engine parameter estimation strategy that can accommodate for some of the aforementioned injector variability. In the presence of an initial parameter error of 25 %, the parameter estimator improved the model-based prediction of total injected fuel by approximately 10 % in Matlab simulations. ^ CDA is another technology that enables improved fuel economy and reduced tailpipe emissions in diesel engines. As the name suggests, CDA involves deactivating some combination of an engine 2 ̆ 7 s cylinders in order to temporarily reduce the total displacement of the engine. Reduced engine displacement can improve fuel economy and reduce harmful engine emissions (by means of reduced air-to-fuel ratio and reduced pumping work), especially at low engine speed and load conditions. However, there are a few challenges that CDA presents. First, engine lubricating oil can accumulate in deactivated cylinders as time progresses. Second, cylinders may not perform normally immediately upon reactivation (a concept referred to as 2 ̆ 2 first-fire readiness 2 ̆ 2) due to this oil accumulation as well as low in-cylinder temperatures that are the result of a prolonged deactivation. Third, changing the combination of firing cylinders can yield undesirable torsional vibrations during CDA operation. This thesis analyzes the first and second of these issues using in-cylinder pressure measurements to study combustion in cylinders that have been reactivated after prolonged periods of deactivation. Experiments show that as more time is spent in CDA mode, more oil accumulates in deactivated cylinders. This oil accumulation can be as much as 500 mg for cylinders that have been deactivated for 20 minutes. CDA durations of 5 and 10 minutes yield accumulated oil masses of up to 376 mg and 255 mg, respectively, while a CDA duration of 0. 5 minutes yields an oil accumulation of less than 1 mg. Since the combustion of this accumulated oil causes abnormally large cumulative heat releases in the engine cycles following the transition from CDA to six cylinder mode, the brake torque does not smoothly transition between these two engine modes. For CDA times of 5, 10, and 20 minutes, these torque fluctuations make such long periods of CDA-only operation unacceptable from a first-fire readiness perspective. ^ Finally, this thesis presents a basic cylinder recharging strategy that can be used in future work to mitigate the effect of oil accumulation and improve first-fire readiness. While improvements in piston ring design can prevent oil accumulation, this cylinder recharging strategy uses software to reactivate all deactivated cylinders for a single engine cycle at regular intervals in an effort to raise in-cylinder pressures enough to prevent oil from seeping into deactivated cylinders. The ability to perform these 2 ̆ 2 recharge events 2 ̆ 2 has been added to the engine test cell used in this study and has been validated experimentally. Although CDA-only operation is unacceptable for periods of time greater than or equal to 5 minutes, CDA operation with regularly-spaced recharge events could enable prolonged CDA operation by mitigating the effects of oil accumulation and first-fire readiness. ...|$|R

Here we show that these are also effective on the T 3 SS of Shigella flexneri, where they block all related forms of protein secretion so far known, {{as well as the}} epithelial cell invasion and induction of macrophage apoptosis usually demonstrated by this bacterium. Furthermore, we show the first evidence for the detrimental effect of these compounds on T 3 SS needle assembly, as demonstrated by increased numbers of T 3 <b>S</b> apparatuses without <b>needles</b> or with shorter needles. Therefore, the compounds generate a phenocopy of T 3 SS export apparatus mutants but with incomplete penetrance. We discuss why this would be sufficient to almost completely block the later secretion of effector proteins and how this begins to narrow the search for the molecular target of these compounds...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Neuroprotective {{strategies}} {{to prevent or}} decrease brain injury in hypoxic ischemic newborns {{are one of the}} main research lines in neonatology. Animal models have been used to assess the efficiency of new therapeutic strategies. Brain damage biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are frequently used to evaluate the outcome at the bedside. Despite the importance of this approach in clinical practice, there are many difficulties in using it in small animals. The aim of this paper was to describe a new technique for collecting CSF in rat pups. Furthermore the reference values of S 100 b protein levels, commonly used in common clinical practice, were analyzed in animals between 7 to 12 days. METHODS: 42 Wistar rat pups aged 7 to 12 days were used. CSF was obtained by direct puncture of the cisterna magna with a 24 -gauge <b>needle.</b> <b>S</b> 100 b protein levels were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: CSF was successfully obtained in 96 % of the cases, with an average amount of 21. 28 µl (5 – 40 ml). Normal values for S 100 b were described. HI animals presented higher S 100 b values than controls. CONCLUSIONS: A simple, reproducible technique for CSF collection in rat pups has been described. This new method will allow study of brain injury biomarkers in newborn hypoxic ischemic animal models.

40|$|Forest {{plantations}} play duo role {{of climate}} change adaptation and mitigation measures. Tanzania’s forest plantation area covers more than 250, 000 ha and it is estimated that, forest plantations in Tanzania hold about 8. 8 million tons of carbon, and 15. 9 tons Carbon/ha which corresponds to Co 2 e 58. 2 tons/ha. Climatic change incidences have repeatedly altered ecosystem balance and function in unpredictable ways. Cited examples, some with cost implications; include: Cypress aphid infestations in Cupressuslusitanica and other genera in the Cupressaceae family in the late 1980 s. Recent insect pest outbreak in a 500 ha Pinuspatula stand at Itimbo West, Sao Hill. In the 2000 <b>s,</b> P. patula <b>needle</b> browning has been observed at Shume and Meru Plantations, while in Rungwe District the species is progressively becoming invasive and growing well at higher altitudes in the Mount Rungwe crater. Late flushing and flowering has been observed in teak plantations in Longuza, and in Eucalypts stands at Malya. Weed growth rate in plantations seems to be intensifying. It is expected that these stressors will most likely intensify as the climate changes. It is proposed that management for adaptation has to focus on maintaining/restoring forest health, and has to seek overlap areas with management for mitigation, and both need uphold cognizance {{of the concept of}} sustainable forest management (SFM) as their core objective. Current plantation forest management practices do not seem to augur well with the concept. Suggestions for securing improvements are provided.

40|$|Canopy interception, throughfall, stemflow, and runoff have {{received}} considerable attention {{during the study}} of water balance and hydrological processes in forested ecosystems. Past research has either neglected or underestimated the role of hydrological functions of litter layers, although some studies have considered the impact of various characteristics of rainfall and litter on litter interception. Based on both simulated rainfall and litter conditions in North China, the effect of litter mass, rainfall intensity and litter type on the maximum water storage capacity of litter (S) and litter interception storage capacity (C) were investigated under five simulated rainfall intensities and four litter masses for two litter types. The results indicated: 1) the S values increased linearly with litter mass, and the S values of broadleaf litter were on average 2. 65 {{times larger than the}} <b>S</b> values of <b>needle</b> leaf litter; 2) rainfall intensity rather than litter mass determined the maximum interception storage capacity (Cmax); Cmax increased linearly with increasing rainfall intensity; by contrast, the minimum interception storage capacity (Cmin) showed a linear relationship with litter mass, but a poor correlation with rainfall intensity; 3) litter type impacted Cmax and Cmin; the values of Cmax and Cmin for broadleaf litter were larger than those of needle leaf litter, which indicated that broadleaf litter could intercepte and store more water than needle leaf litter; 4) a gap existed between Cmax and Cmin, indicating that litter played a significant role by allowing rainwater to infiltrate or to produce runoff rather than intercepting it and allowing it to evaporate after the rainfall event; 5) Cmin was always less than S at the same litter mass, which should be considered in future interception predictions. Vegetation and precipitation characteristics played important roles in hydrological characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The Shigella type III {{secretion}} machinery {{is responsible}} for delivering to host cells the set of effectors required for invasion. The type III secretion complex comprises a needle composed of MxiH and MxiI and a basal body made up of MxiD, MxiG, and MxiJ. In <b>S.</b> flexneri, the <b>needle</b> length has a narrow range, {{with a mean of}} approximately 45 nm, suggesting that it is strictly regulated. Here we show that Spa 32, encoded by one of the spa genes, is an essential protein translocated via the type III secretion system and is involved in the control of needle length as well as type III secretion activity. When the spa 32 gene was mutated, the type III secretion complexes possessed needles of various lengths, ranging from 40 to 1, 150 nm. Upon introduction of a cloned spa 32 into the spa 32 mutant, the bacteria produced needles of wild-type length. The spa 32 mutant overexpressing MxiH produced extremely long (> 5 μm) needles. Spa 32 was secreted into the medium via the type III secretion system, but secretion did not depend on activation of the system. The spa 32 mutant and the mutant overexpressing MxiH did not secrete effectors such as Ipa proteins into the medium or invade HeLa cells. Upon introduction of Salmonella invJ, encoding InvJ, which has 15. 4 % amino acid identity with Spa 32, into the spa 32 mutant, the bacteria produced type III needles of wild-type length and efficiently entered HeLa cells. These findings suggest that Spa 32 is an essential secreted protein for a functional type III secretion system in Shigella spp. and is involved in the control of needle length. Furthermore, its function is interchangeable with that of Salmonella InvJ...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} {{and severity of}} induction complications with Althesin increases {{with the speed of}} injection and particularly with high doses, when its cardiovascular depressant effects become more marked. The clinical impression that the rate of injection influences the incidence of induction complications with barbiturates was confirmed by Barron in 1968. He injected equivalent doses of thiopentone and methohexitone at four speeds using a constant rate infusion syringe. Involuntary muscle movement and cough or hiccup occurred much more frequently at the faster rates of injection, particularly with metho-hexitone. In talking to anaesthetists who have used Althesin one finds conflicting views as to the inci-dence of induction complications, which cannot be explained on the grounds of variations of premedi-cation. It is conceivable that the rate of injection is critical with this drug and the present study was designed to investigate its importance. London).

40|$|Forest liming has {{received}} increased {{attention in the}} 1980 <b>s,</b> when unusual <b>needle</b> yellowing and fall were observed in large parts of Europe and North America. This ‘new forest decline’ {{has been attributed to}} several causes acting individually or synergetically, amongst which were acidification, N saturation and nutritional imbalances. This time, liming did not aim at increased productivity, but as a counteracting measure to the soil acidification and to remove nutritional imbalances. 	The Belgian Ardennes were not exempt from this phenomena and symptoms of forest dieback were reported in 1983 by Weissen (Weissen et al., 1983). Soils are naturally poor in magnesium and the observed dieback {{was supposed to be the}} consequence of increased pollution exacerbating the deficiency in magnesium. A reduction in productivity and financial losses were predicted. Liming was suggested for prevention and correction, however possible side effects, in particular on soil solution (tree nutrition) and stream water chemistry (drinking water) needed to be evaluated. 	In this paper, we present results from a case study in four Picea abies watersheds in southern Belgium. The paired watersheds of approximately 80 ha were situated in the ‘Haute Ardenne’ and in the ‘Ardenne occidentale’ regions, on acid brown soils. One watershed of each pair was limed with 3 T/ha of fine ground dolomite ((Ca,Mg) CO 3) 55 / 40 and 200 kg/ha K 2 SO 4 in 1992 and 1993, respectively. Rainfall, throughfall and monolith lysimeter soil solution were analysed at monthly intervals, and runoff chemistry at two-weekly intervals (volume-weighed reconstructed daily samples). Time series intervention analysis was used as a tool to detect statistically significant changes in stream water chemistry due to the liming event, and fluxes were calculated to evaluate losses of the applied dolomitic lime to the catchment stream. 	Dolomite dissolution distinctively affected streamwater chemistry in the watershed situated in the Hautes Ardennes (Waroneu). Magnesium concentrations increased immediately after liming, most likely due to surface runoff. Four years after liming, concentrations were still higher than prior to liming. However, the proportions of magnesium lost were relatively low compared to the dose applied. Calcium concentrations did not change after liming in either catchment, nor did the concentrations of the major cations and anions measured. In the monolith lysimeters, magnesium concentrations increased immediately after liming under the organic horizons, and one year after liming under the mineral horizons. Calcium concentrations increased only three years after the application of lime under the organic and mineral horizons. These results led to the conclusions that for the soils under study and the doses applied, a major part of the lime was retained by the soil system, and that consequences on water chemistry were minor...|$|R
40|$|Forest liming has {{received}} increased attention since the 1980 <b>s,</b> when unusual <b>needle</b> yellowing and fall {{were observed in}} large parts of Europe and North America. This ‘new forest decline’ {{has been attributed to}} several causes acting individually or in synergy, amongst which were 'acid rain', nitrogen saturation and nutritional imbalances. Liming at moderate doses was suggested as a counteracting measure against soil acidification and to remove nutritional deficiencies. Another major forest management operation is whole tree harvesting. Both liming and clearcut may however affect the water quality leaving the treated areas. In particular, nitrate leaching is of major concern, as nitrate leaching may be linked to soil acidification, associated cation and/or aluminium release, and nitrate contamination of surface and groundwater. In this paper, I summarise main results of studies performed in the Belgian Ardennes. In this area, the acid brown soils are naturally poor in magnesium and the observed forest dieback symptoms were supposed to be the consequence of increased pollution exacerbating magnesium deficiency. Liming was suggested for prevention and correction. However, possible side effects, in particular on soil solution and stream water chemistry needed to be evaluated. Another major concern was the effects of clearcut operations on the streamwater quality in this area important for drinking water collection. The effects of dolomite lime were investigated at the watershed, plot and laboratory level. Paired watersheds of approximately 80 ha were mainly covered with Picea abies. One watershed of each pair was limed with 3 T/ha of fine ground dolomite and 200 kg/ha K 2 SO 4. Runoff chemistry was analysed for major cations and anions and time series intervention analysis was used to detect statistically significant changes in stream water chemistry. Results showed increased magnesium concentrations immediately after liming, but {{a major part of the}} lime was retained by the soil system, and consequences on water chemistry were minor. However, in the plot study, where 5 T ha- 1 of a dolomite lime suspension were applied to adjacent Quercus petraea and Picea abies stands, soil solution nitrate concentrations were significantly increased through liming in the Quercus plots. Increased net nitrification in the Quercus stand was confirmed by potential net nitrification measurements in the laboratory. The effects of tree harvesting on streamwater ion concentrations were investigated by clear felling 22 ha (9650 m 3 wood) of a 81 ha watershed. This area represented one third of the forested area, the remaining area being covered equally with young plantations and 70 - 100 year old Picea abies. First data indicate increased potassium, iron, lead and organic carbon concentrations, but no major change in streamwater nitrate concentrations. Results will be discussed in relation to literature data and known controlling factors of the nitrification process. This analysis reveals that the speed, extent and duration of a perturbation in nitrate leaching after liming or felling vary at different sites. Risks assessment for nitrate leaching is therefore difficult and prediction of nitrate leaching in response to a perturbation remains an important challenge for further studies. In particular, basic controls of the nitrification process and relation nitrification/immobilisation need further investigation...|$|R
