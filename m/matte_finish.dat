5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it easier to see Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, <b>matte</b> <b>finish.</b> There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation 4 Slim (officially marketed {{simply as}} PlayStation 4 or PS4) was {{unveiled}} on September 7, 2016. It is {{a revision of}} the original PS4 hardware with a streamlined form factor. The new casing is 40% smaller, and carries a rounded body with a <b>matte</b> <b>finish</b> {{on the top of}} the console rather than a two-tone finish. The two USB ports on the front have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was also removed. It ships with a minor update to the DualShock 4 controller, with the light bar visible through the top of the touchpad and dark matte grey coloured exterior instead of a partially shiny black. The PS4 Slim was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500 GB model at the same price point as the original PS4 model. Its model number is CUH-2000.|$|E
25|$|Watches {{and other}} jewelry that might enter the optical plane {{should not be}} allowed in the laboratory. All {{non-optical}} objects that are close to the optical plane should have a <b>matte</b> <b>finish</b> in order to prevent specular reflections.|$|E

5000|$|The Nokia Lumia 920 {{shares the}} [...] "Fabula" [...] design {{language}} of its predecessors, the Lumia 900 and 800, {{as well as}} the Nokia N9, with a unibody polycarbonate shell. Multiple colors with glossy and <b>matte</b> <b>finishes</b> were available.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to majolica, two large factories turn out hand painted ceramics of the kaolin type. These are Bram and Dosa {{in the city}} a Guanajuato {{and the town of}} Marfil respectively. Most of these designs are contemporary forms, with pastel floral motifs in a brilliant or <b>matte</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{the blade}} is forged, {{it is then}} sent to be polished. The {{polishing}} takes between one and three weeks. The polisher uses finer and finer grains of polishing stones in a process called glazing, until the blade has a mirror finish. However, the blunt edge of the katana is often given a <b>matte</b> <b>finish</b> to emphasize the hamon.|$|E
25|$|Like marimbas, {{professional}} vibraphones have bars of graduated width. Lower {{bars are}} made from wider stock, and higher notes from narrower stock, to help balance volume and tone across {{the range of the}} instrument. The bars are anodized, typically in silver or gold color, after fine tuning, and may have a smooth or brushed (<b>matte)</b> <b>finish.</b> These are cosmetic features with a negligible effect on the sound.|$|E
50|$|Photo {{paper is}} {{typically}} divided into glossy, semi-matte, semi-gloss, satin or silk, and <b>matte</b> <b>finishes.</b> Paper thickness varies widely. Lighter weights {{are not much}} different from the general-purpose office papers described above, and can be used for all types of printing, though these are the least expensive and lowest-quality photo papers.|$|R

25|$|Ray casting is {{primarily}} used for realtime simulations, {{such as those}} used in 3D computer games and cartoon animations, where detail is not important, or where it is more efficient to manually fake the details {{in order to obtain}} better performance in the computational stage. This is usually the case when a large number of frames need to be animated. The resulting surfaces have a characteristic 'flat' appearance when no additional tricks are used, as if objects in the scene were all painted with <b>matte</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Pebble Steel is a steel-bodied {{variant of}} the {{original}} Pebble smartwatch. Announced at CES 2014, it has a thinner body, tactile metal buttons, and Corning Gorilla Glass. It comes in 2 variations: a black <b>matte</b> <b>finish</b> and a brushed stainless steel finish, with both a black leather band and a matching steel band. It was released in February 2014. The CNET reviewer liked the design, readability, swim-friendliness and selection of apps, while he disliked the lack of storage that limits to 8 user installed apps {{and the lack of}} a heart-rate monitor.|$|E
25|$|Sizes range {{all the way}} up to 7inches (18cm). As well, resolutions also vary, {{going up}} to WVGA. Most screens come with a colour depth of 16-bit, but higher quality video {{oriented}} devices may range all the way to 24-bit, otherwise known as True colour, with the ability to display 16.7million distinct colours. Screens commonly have a <b>matte</b> <b>finish</b> but may also come in glossy to increase colour intensity and contrast. More and more devices are now also coming with touch screen as a form of primary or alternate input. This can be for convenience and/or aesthetic purposes. Certain devices, on the other hand, have no screen whatsoever, reducing costs at the expense of ease of browsing through the media library.|$|E

25|$|Written {{messages}} on plastic slates {{can be used}} to convey complex messages with a low risk of misunderstanding. Slates are available in various sizes and are usually hard white plastic with a <b>matte</b> <b>finish,</b> suitable for writing on with a pencil. They can be stored in various ways, but in a pocket or bungeed to the wrist are popular methods. Clipped to the diver by a lanyard is another method, but there is a greater risk of entanglement. Slates may be used to record information to be used on the dive, such as decompression schedules, to discuss matters of importance for which hand signals are not sufficient, and to record data collected during the dive. Waterproof paper wet-notes are a compact equivalent, and pre-printed waterproof data-sheets and clip-board are routinely used by scientific divers for recording observations.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, Congress {{authorized}} silver-clad collector {{versions of}} the Bicentennial coins; in April 1975, the Mint began to strike them. The coins were issued in both proof and uncirculated quality. Copper-nickel clad Bicentennial coins were placed in both the 1975 and 1976 proof sets, while their silver clad counterparts were sold in three coin sets. [...] Since 1992, the Mint has struck Kennedy half dollars in 90%silver for inclusion in special silver proof sets. 1964 proofs were struck in Philadelphia, and since 1968, proof coins have been struck in San Francisco only. [...] In 1998, some silver proof pieces were struck to a <b>matte</b> <b>finish</b> for inclusion in a set along with a Robert Kennedy commemorative silver dollar. [...] From 2005–2010, uncirculated pieces included in mint sets received a <b>matte</b> <b>finish,</b> which differentiates them from the pieces sold in bags and rolls.|$|E
500|$|Emerson {{ground the}} blades of these knives from ATS-34 steel with a Rockwell {{hardness}} of 57–59 {{and made them}} thicker toward the tip, creating a stronger-tipped blade than he had made previously. He bead-blasted the blades as he did the liners and bolsters instead of rubbing or polishing them, giving them a <b>matte</b> <b>finish</b> {{as opposed to the}} mirror-polished finish common on his earlier knives and other knives at the time. [...] Emerson designed each one of these knives for a specific purpose. The slender Viper 1 and smaller Viper 2 were designed for use as a police officer's backup weapon. [...] The Viper 5 was designed to be used by naval boat crews, as the handle was contoured with a rear brake so as to not slip from the user's hand when wet and the Viper 3 was designed as a pure fighting knife with its 4-inch blade.|$|E

500|$|Proof coins {{were struck}} from 1907 until 1915, all at Philadelphia. [...] Not all {{quantities}} are known, but the highest {{for which the}} number struck is known is 1910, with a mintage of 204 (one sold for $80,500 in 2006). [...] One of the surviving specimens of the mostly melted rounded rim pieces is in proof; this unique specimen is in private hands. [...] Numismatic expert Mike Fuljenz, in his book on the gold pieces with Indian designs struck in the early 20th century, suggests that this coin was a trial piece, resulting from the test of new dies. [...] Different finishes are known for the proof coins. [...] The unique 1907 piece is in satin proof (the raised designs appear like satin), but later proof eagles were struck in a dark <b>matte</b> <b>finish.</b> [...] Some 1908–1910 proof eagles were struck in a lighter [...] "Roman finish".|$|E
500|$|As {{a cheaper}} option the UX32A was praised by Chris Martin of PC Advisor for being [...] "a more {{affordable}} luxury", retaining the [...] "premium feel" [...] of the Zenbook range {{but at a}} lower price point. The aluminium chassis, which is identical to the UX32VD to keep costs down, was widely acclaimed for its strength and build quality. By contrast, the Sandy Bridge chip, a previous-generation part at the time of sale, was outlined as a detraction as was the lower battery life compared to the UX31E. Although the screen used was a TN panel and of a lower resolution than the UX32VD or UX31A, it was considered an acceptable compromise for the price. The screen has a <b>matte</b> <b>finish</b> and relatively high brightness which Notebook Check's reviewer, Christian Hepp, found [...] "quite suitable for outdoor use", noting that it had a good contrast ratio but a narrow range of colours.|$|E

50|$|Philip Grausman (born July 16, 1935) is an American {{sculptor}} {{who continues}} to push {{the limits of the}} time-honored portrait in art. His early work focused on natural forms representing buds and seeds, and this exploration led him to the underlying structure and form of the human head. His monumental heads of fiberglass display a subtle hand, and the lack of detail makes a stunning presentation. He also continues to create reductivist portraits at normal scale, experimenting with various metals with <b>matte</b> <b>finishes</b> to accomplish his vision.|$|R
2500|$|... 1996, {{the same}} way than 1973, was divided into two {{different}} phases on the Mexican Volkswagen Beetle history. On the first one all the characteristic chrome moldings were dropped. However, the door handles, side moldings, stirrups moldings and side mirrors, now had a black <b>matte</b> <b>finish,</b> the window moldings disappear completely. Bumpers and headlight moldings from now were painted {{the color of the}} car. The colors and clothes inside were unchanged from the 1995 model year.|$|E
2500|$|Broken Walrus I, a {{mild steel}} {{sculpture}} with an orange-red painted <b>matte</b> <b>finish,</b> was an abstract {{representation of a}} single walrus tusk broken into two pieces. Rather than a realistic, round tusk, it had squared edges and exaggerated, squared ends. To portray the sense of brokenness, the work had two pieces: a larger, main tusk and a smaller section resting against it. The larger section had thin pieces on the sides that radiated from each curve to give it an even more abstract feel. The piece's dimensions were [...] by [...] by it sat on a raised concrete rectangle base measuring approximately [...] high by [...] long.|$|E
2500|$|For platinum, gold, {{and silver}} jewellery, {{there are many}} {{techniques}} to create finishes. The most common are high-polish, satin/matte, brushed, and hammered. High-polished jewellery {{is the most common}} and gives the metal a highly reflective, shiny look. Satin, or <b>matte</b> <b>finish</b> reduces the shine and reflection of the jewellery, and this is commonly used to accentuate gemstones such as diamonds. Brushed finishes give the jewellery a textured look and are created by brushing a material (similar to sandpaper) against the metal, leaving [...] "brush strokes". Hammered finishes are typically created by using a rounded steel hammer and hammering the jewellery to give it a wavy texture.|$|E

50|$|Acrylic paints with gloss or <b>matte</b> <b>finishes</b> are common, {{although}} a satin (semi-matte) sheen is most common. Some brands exhibit {{a range of}} finishes (e.g. heavy-body paints from Golden, Liquitex, Winsor & Newton and Daler-Rowney); Politec acrylics are fully matte. As with oils, pigment amounts and particle size or shape can affect the paint sheen. Matting agents can also be added during manufacture to dull the finish. If desired, the artist can mix different media with their paints and use topcoats or varnishes to alter or unify sheen.|$|R
