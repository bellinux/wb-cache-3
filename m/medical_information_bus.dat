40|$|The <b>Medical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Bus</b> (MIB) {{software}} {{is based on}} a new object-oriented Medical Device Data Language (MDDL) under development by the P 1073 MIB Standard Committee. The MDDL treats devices, host computers, humans and parameters as objects, and provides a rich and extensible language for describing and passing messages between objects. This paper describes the MDDL semantic reference model, and reports on an initial MDDL messaging prototype, based on the typical communications requirements of a pulse oximeter type device. This analysis was developed as part of the ongoing process in validating the robustness and completeness of the MDDL architectural reference model...|$|E
40|$|The P 1073 <b>Medical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Bus</b> (MIB) is {{a formal}} {{standards}} effort organized {{under the auspices}} of the Engineering and Biology in Medicine Society (EMBS) of the Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers (IEEE). The primary purpose of the MIB is to transfer bedside data efficiently and accurately while decreasing the amount of time required for chart documentation. The MIB standard will provide automatic transmission of data from medical equipment to clinical data management computers. This data could include such information as ventilator settings, volumes of IV intakes, cardiac rhythms and instrument alarms. Nurses would need only to verify the transmitted information instead of reading it from bedside devices and manually transcribing it into a computer...|$|E
40|$|A {{system has}} been {{developed}} at LDS Hospital for gathering information from monitoring equipment located at the bedside in the Intensive Care Units (ICU). The <b>Medical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Bus</b> (MIB) provides a generalized method of attaching patient monitoring devices to a common interface. This interface converts the unique manufacturer data communications protocol into a standardized hardware and software system. Therefore, the MIB system {{eliminates the need for}} custom connectors and software presently needed to interface such devices. The MIB interface also has the ability to “filter”, store and select information sent for inclusion into the clinical medical record on the clinical computer system. Infusion pumps, ventilators, pulse oximeters, and other patient equipment are now transmitting clinical information for use in clinical data reporting and decision making...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify actual {{conditions}} and problems in <b>medical</b> <b>information</b> education and to propose the educational concept to be adopted in <b>medical</b> <b>information.</b> A questionnaire survey was carried out by the anonymous method in June 2008. The survey was intended for 40 radiological technology schools. The questionnaire items were as follows: (1) educational environment in <b>medical</b> <b>information</b> education, (2) content of a lecture in <b>medical</b> <b>information,</b> (3) problems in <b>medical</b> <b>information</b> education. The response rate was 55. 0 % (22 schools). Half of the responding schools had a laboratory on <b>medical</b> <b>information.</b> Seventeen schools had a <b>medical</b> <b>information</b> education facility, and out of them, approximately 50 % had an educational <b>medical</b> <b>information</b> system. The main problems of the <b>medical</b> <b>information</b> education were as follows: (a) motivation of the students is low, (b) the educational coverage and level for <b>medical</b> <b>information</b> are uncertain, (c) there are not an appropriate textbook and educational guidance. In conclusion, these findings suggest that it is necessary to have a vision of <b>medical</b> <b>information</b> education in the education of radiological technologists...|$|R

40|$|Care of the acutely ill patient {{requires}} rapid acquisition, {{recording and}} communications of data. In the modern hospital {{it is not}} unusual for a patient to be connected to several monitoring and recording devices simultaneously. Each of these devices is typically made by a different manufacturer who may specialize in one sort of measurement, for example, pulse oximetry. Most of the modern monitoring and recording devices are micro-processor based and have communications capabilities. Unfortunately, there is no operable standard communications technology available from all devices. In addition different clinical staff (physicians, nurses, or respiratory therapists) may be responsible for collecting data. As a result there is a need to develop methods, standards, and strategies for timely and automatic collection of data from these monitoring and recording devices. We report on more than 5 years of clinical experience of automated ICU data collection using a prototype of the <b>Medical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Bus</b> (MIB) ...|$|E

40|$|Keywords- {{telecare}} <b>medical</b> <b>information</b> system; mutual authentication; dynamic ID; {{elliptic curve}} cryptography Abstract—Recently, the telecare <b>medical</b> <b>information</b> system, which enables various healthcare delivery services, {{has been paid}} more and more attention in countries with aging populations. Using the telecare <b>medical</b> <b>information</b> system, {{it is possible to}} bring the advantages of telemedical directly into the patient’s home.

40|$|There is {{a wealth}} of <b>medical</b> <b>information</b> now {{available}} to the public through various sources that are not necessarily controlled by medical or healthcare professionals. In Australia there has been a strong movement in the health consumer arena of consumer-led sharing and production of <b>medical</b> <b>information</b> and in healthcare decision-making.
