50|$|He married Anna Thilo, {{daughter}} of Professor Wilhelm Thilo of Berlin, on 25 June 1872. She had been awarded a diploma (Geprũfte Lehrerin fũr Preußen) from the Ladies' University of Berlin, {{and came to}} South Australia as a governess {{for the children of}} Sir James Fergusson. Following a return to Europe in 1873, the <b>Marvals</b> returned to Adelaide, where he worked as tutor and she as head of a school for young ladies, operating from Ramsay House, once the home of Dr. Gosse on the Rundle Place (now Gawler Place) corner of North Terrace. She took boarders and day pupils, and taught singing, dancing and deportment, as well as French. Anna Montgomerie Martin was one of her teachers. In December 1874 they took over the staff and students of Miss Senner's school, Palm House, Hackney.|$|R
50|$|Annie, who {{may have}} {{determined}} never to marry, had to find herself a source of income, and like many other cultured women such as Caroline Carleton who found themselves without a partner, she set herself up as a tutor {{for the children of}} the better-off citizens of Adelaide. Subsequently, around 1870, she opened a morning school on the upper floor of a house in Pulteney Street. At first the clients of Miss Martin's School were mostly members of the Unitarian Church, but word spread that she was providing a well-rounded education free from dogma (comparable perhaps to John L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution but co-educational and teaching humanities rather than science, accounting and surveying). In 1874 The University of Adelaide opened, and from its inception allowed female students, and Miss Martin's School moved its focus to preparation of girls for higher education. The school closed in 1874 (perhaps from a dearth of suitable teachers) and Annie reverted to tutoring in a private residence on Strangways Terrace, North Adelaide, then worked at Mme. <b>Marval's</b> school in Ramsay Building at the corner of North Terrace and Rundle Place (now Gawler Place), tutoring in English and Mathematics. She may then have taught at Miss Senner's school in Barnard Street, North Adelaide. She took another two years off in England 1883-1884, then reopened her school at her home in Osmond Terrace, Norwood, teaching French, German, Italian and Greek. In 1893 she set up school at the corner of Pulteney and Rundle Streets, then on Victoria Square in 1897.|$|R
