500|$|My own {{daughter}} [...] is considerably superior in capacity {{to the one}} her mother had before. Fanny, the eldest, is of a quiet, modest, unshowy disposition, somewhat given to indolence, which is her greatest fault, but sober, observing, peculiarly clear and distinct in the faculty of memory, and disposed to exercise her own thoughts and follow her own judgment. Mary, <b>my</b> <b>daughter,</b> <b>is</b> the reverse of her in many particulars. She is singularly bold, somewhat imperious, and active of mind. Her desire for knowledge is great, and her perseverance in everything she undertakes is almost invincible. My {{own daughter}} is, I believe, very pretty; Fanny {{is by no means}} handsome, but in general prepossessing.|$|E
500|$|Letter to <b>My</b> <b>Daughter</b> <b>is</b> Maya Angelou's third book of essays. [...] She had {{published}} several volumes of poetry, including Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), which {{was nominated for}} the Pulitzer Prize. She had recited her poem, [...] "On the Pulse of Morning", at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton in 1993, making her the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961. In 2009, when Letter was published, Angelou {{had published}} six out of her seven installments of her series of autobiographies. Her sixth autobiography, A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002), was considered her final autobiography until she published her seventh autobiography, Mom & Me & Mom, in 2013, {{at the age of}} 85.|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} Gipsy Danger's {{artificial}} intelligence system. Del Toro secured permission from Valve Corporation to cast McLain in homage to GLaDOS, her homicidal AI {{character in the}} Portal video games. The director stated: [...] "It {{was clear to me}} that we needed something beautiful in that voice. <b>My</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>is</b> my wingman, we had done co-op on Portal 2 {{for a long time and}} I did Portal 1 when it came out. It becomes ingrained in you, that voice. I didn't want to use her as a negative force of evil. I called Valve and asked 'Can you give us the filter?' so we went full GLaDOS for the first commercial, but I thought it was too much. If you're a gamer, it's too distracting so we created our own GLaDOS 2.0 filter that's a little less full-on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lil Wayne {{has four}} children. His first child, {{daughter}} Reginae, was born {{when he was}} 16, to {{his high school sweetheart}} Antonia [...] "Toya" [...] Carter (née Johnson). They married on Valentine's Day 2004 and divorced in 2006. Internet rumors started circulating in August 2008 that Wayne's daughter had died in a car crash, which however he quickly cleared up as false saying [...] "Please allow me to dispel any rumors or speculations and report that <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>is</b> alive, healthy and surrounded by family who care and love her dearly. The rumors are completely false and unfounded; neither Reginae nor any other member of my family has been involved in any car accident." ...|$|E
