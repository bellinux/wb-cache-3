5|$|DST's clock shifts {{have the}} obvious {{disadvantage}} of complexity. People <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> {{to change their}} clocks; this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely. People who work across time zone boundaries need {{to keep track of}} multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way. The length of the calendar day becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive. During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock reads times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion.|$|E
5|$|If a cat so chooses, {{they can}} take a {{different}} calling in life {{as that of a}} medicine cat. Medicine cats, unlike warriors, serve for their clan not through bloodshed, but through peace. They are trained to heal their Clanmates by using the natural resources as medicines; for example, cobwebs can be used to stitch deep wounds, whilst poppy seeds are used to lull a distressed cat into sleep. They sleep separately, surrounded by the herbs and resources they need to keep their Clan safe and healthy. Medicine cat apprentices go through a longer period of training than warriors, due to the vast amount of knowledge they <b>must</b> <b>remember.</b> Medicine cats are also not allowed to take any mates or have any kits. This is because they must care for each member of their Clan equally; if they were to form a loving relationship with any one individual, they may unfairly place that cat’s life over that of the Clan. A Clan tends to have only one or two, and occasionally three, medicine cats at any given time.|$|E
5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E

5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E

25|$|The recent anecdotal {{reports of}} {{positive}} effects of the marijuana derivative cannabidiol for some individuals with treatment-resistant epilepsy give reason for hope. However, we <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> that these are only anecdotal reports, and robust scientific evidence {{for the use of}} marijuana is lacking... at present, the epilepsy community does not know if marijuana is a safe and effective treatment, nor do they know the long-term effects that marijuana will have on learning, memory and behavior, especially in infants and young children.|$|E
25|$|I am {{sent here}} as a peace chief; all here is to be peace, but north of the Arkansas is General Sheridan, the great war chief, and I do not control him; and {{he has all the}} {{soldiers}} who are fighting the Arapahoes and Cheyennes.

25|$|In general, {{identification}} to genus {{can often}} be accomplished in the field using a local mushroom guide. Identification to species, however, requires more effort; one <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> that a mushroom develops from a button stage into a mature structure, and only the latter can provide certain characteristics needed for {{the identification of the}} species. However, over-mature specimens lose features and cease producing spores. Many novices have mistaken humid water marks on paper for white spore prints, or discolored paper from oozing liquids on lamella edges for colored spored prints.|$|E
25|$|Methods {{that test}} {{prospective}} memory require {{the distinction between}} retrospective memory, which is remembering information, and prospective memory, which is remembering information for the future. Prospective memory requires retrospective memory because one <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> the information itself in order {{to act in the}} future. For example, remembering to buy groceries after work (prospective memory) requires the ability to remember what type of groceries are needed (retrospective memory). While prospective memory and retrospective memory are connected, they are distinguishable. This makes it possible to separate these two processes during tests.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E

25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: {{but there are times}} when the laws of nature assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E
