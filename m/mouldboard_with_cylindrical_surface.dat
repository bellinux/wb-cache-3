40|$|Abstract − Products <b>with</b> <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surfaces</b> are {{manufactured}} in many (e. g. paper, chemical, steel, heating or shipping) industries. It is required that regular estimations of cylindricity profiles be {{made during the}} production process. The reference methods {{can be used for}} measurement of cylindricity. The cylindricity deviation includes the roundness deviation in different cross-sections of an object, the relative change of its diameter and the non-centricity of profiles in relation to the nominal axis of the object. The reference measurement systems applied nowadays enable measurement of roundness profiles in relation to fixed points of support in different cross-sections of the measured object. Furthermore, it is possible to evaluate the relative difference of the diameters. However, in traditional reference measurement systems there is no possibility of measurement of the non-concentricity of profiles. That is why appropriate reference systems for measurement of cylindricity have had to be developed. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that from the}} {{existence}} of electromagnetic momentum flow and from the law of momentum conservation there follows {{the existence of a}} previously unknown force. The author suggests to experimenters to verify the generation of Khmelnik force and to supplement its name by their own names. In [1] it is shown that the Lorentz and Ampere forces can be defined as the consequences of the existence of electromagnetic momentum flow and of the law of momentum preservation. They are defined in the form (in SI system) : cSVF, (1) where S- the energy flow density, V- volume of body, which is penetrated by the flow of electromagnetic field, - relative permittivity of body, - relative permeability of body, c- light speed in vacuum. Based on this form it can be asserted that there exists an additional force which we shall call for short “Khmelnik force ” (if, of course, nobody had considered previously this force). In particular, it can be the Lorentz force or the Ampere force. But in other cases it is not equivalent to these forces. Consider some of these cases. 2. Faraday motor The most striking example of such a force can be observed in the design shown in the following Fig. 1. "The inventor of this motor took disc of neodymium magnet with nickel coating, magnetized along the axis, in the center attracted to it by magnet a screw with a sharp end, and that end attracted by magnet to the positive terminal of round battery. Then he connected the negative terminal of the battery by thin wire (like a brush) <b>with</b> <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surface</b> of the magnet.

40|$|Laser surface {{hardening}} of mechanical steel components is a rapidly developing manufacturing technology which allows {{to deal with}} small, confined and complex surfaces. It allows, in fact, to accurately focus the hardening treatment only where it is needed, without affecting the surrounding base material. This prerogative differentiates laser hardening from any other surface treatment, such as flame or induction, and makes possible to save time and energy during the process.

40|$|With the {{motivation}} of determining the critical roughness size, a global stability and sensitivity analysis of a three-dimensional Falkner–Skan–Cooke (FSC) boundary layer <b>with</b> a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surface</b> roughness is performed. The roughness size is chosen such that breakdown to turbulence is initiated by a global version of traditional secondary instabilities of the crossflow (CF) vortices, instead of an immediate flow tripping at the roughness. The resulting global eigenvalue spectra of the systems {{are found to be}} very sensitive to numerical parameters and domain size. This sensitivity to numerical parameters is quantified using the "-pseudospectrum, and the dependency on the domain is analysed through an impulse response and an energy budget. It is shown that the growth rates increase with domain size, which originates from the inclusion of stronger CF vortices in the baseflow. This is reflected in a change in the rate of advective energy transport by the baseflow. It is concluded that the onset of global instability in a FSC boundary layer as the roughness height is increased does not correspond to an immediate flow tripping behind the roughness, but occurs for lower roughness heights if su ciently long domains are considered. However, the great sensitivity results in an inability to accurately pinpoint the exact parameter values for the bifurcation, and the large spatial growth of the disturbances in the long domains eventually becomes larger than what can be resolved using finite precision arithmetics.   QC 20161125 </p...|$|R
