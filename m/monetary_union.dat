Although the creation of a <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> was not envisaged in the Eurasian Economic Union Treaty, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called for the introduction of a common currency for the Eurasian Economic Union. Leonid Slutsky, head of the State Duma's CIS committee, backed Medvedev's proposal to start discussions on the creation of a <b>monetary</b> <b>union.</b> Slutsky said it could be introduced shortly after 2015, when the union's structure becomes clear.|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of {{cross-border}} competition among currencies, informed observers predict that the new <b>monetary</b> <b>unions</b> are virtually inevitable {{in many parts of the}} world.

5|$|The first {{shooting}} thalers were cantonal pieces, minted by {{the sovereign}} cantons of Switzerland. All of these pieces, {{as well as}} the 1855 Solothurn issue, were strictly legal tender. Nineteenth-century Confederation shooting thaler issues were minted to legal fineness, and were thus allowed to bear the denomination of five francs. Beginning in 1865, Switzerland {{became a member of the}} Latin <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union.</b> Shooting thalers were not included in the mintages authorized by the Union. Therefore, these issues are commonly considered semi-medallic, though they could circulate due to their size and weight being the same as that of the regular five franc issues. This series of shooting thalers, following the standards of the Latin <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union,</b> began in 1855 with the Solothurn issue and ended in 1885 with the Bern issue. In 1927, the <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union</b> ceased to exist. Mintage began on a new series of shooting thalers in 1934 in honor of the shooting festival in Fribourg, and another design was issued in 1939 for the Lucerne festival. The 1934 issue was the last official shooting thaler that matched the circulating counterpart in both diameter and weight. The 1939 issues were not the same size and weight as their circulating counterparts, but both issues were redeemable only at the shooting festival or participating businesses. Production of shooting thalers was cut short with the outbreak of World War II. In 1984, a new series of shooting thalers began mintage, due largely to the efforts of California-based coin dealer Richard Nelson. These issues, like those minted in 1934 and 1939, are not minted to legal fineness and are not considered legal tender.|$|E
5|$|The Wall Street Journal conjectured as {{well that}} Germany could return to the Deutsche Mark, or create another {{currency}} union with the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Luxembourg and other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Baltics. A <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> of these countries with current account surpluses would create the world's largest creditor bloc, bigger than China or Japan. The Wall Street Journal added that without the German-led bloc, a residual euro would have the flexibility to keep interest rates low and engage in quantitative easing or fiscal stimulus {{in support of a}} job-targeting economic policy instead of inflation targeting in the current configuration.|$|E
5|$|The euro was {{established}} by the provisions in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty.

In the Maastricht Treaty, the United Kingdom and Denmark were granted exemptions per their request from moving to the stage of <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> {{which resulted in the}} introduction of the euro.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{currency}} devaluations and oil crises in the 1970s led most countries to float their currencies. The world economy became increasingly financially integrated in the 1980s and 1990s due to capital account liberalization and financial deregulation. A series of financial crises in Europe, Asia, and Latin America followed with contagious effects due to greater exposure to volatile capital flows. The global financial crisis, which {{originated in the}} United States in 2007, quickly propagated among other nations and is recognized as the catalyst for the worldwide Great Recession. A market adjustment to Greece's noncompliance with its <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> in 2009 ignited a sovereign debt crisis among European nations known as the Eurozone crisis.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's economy {{suffered}} heavily {{during the}} 1994 genocide, with widespread loss of life, {{failure to maintain}} infrastructure, looting, and neglect of important cash crops. This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's ability to attract private and external investment. The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita GDP (PPP) estimated at $2,090 in 2017, compared with $416 in 1994. Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States. The economy is managed by the central National Bank of Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in August 2015, the exchange rate was 755 francs to the United States dollar. Rwanda joined the East African Community in 2007, and has ratified a plan for <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> amongst the five member nations, which could eventually lead to a common East African shilling.|$|E
5|$|In February 1992, European Union {{countries}} {{signed the}} Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union</b> (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the European Monetary Institute which was ultimately dissolved {{in tandem with}} the establishment in 1998 of the European Central Bank (ECB) and European System of Central Banks. Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the Euro, adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they disaggregated their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, exchangeable for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. , the EMU comprises 17 nations which have issued the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyses}} {{the experience}} with rule-based monetary policy in African countries which have participated in <b>monetary</b> <b>unions</b> (CFA Franc Zone, Eastern African Currency Board and Rand Monetary Area). We show that African countries have generally lacked the domestic political institutions which would allow individual governments to tie their hands by establishing such rules. <b>Monetary</b> <b>unions</b> {{have proved to be}} an alternative possibility for credible commitment to sound macroeconomic policies, but only in cases where exit from a union is made costly by the provision of side-payments (or sanctions) in other areas of regional co-operation, and only when governance structures have been designed so as to maximise chances for the enforcement of monetary rules.

5|$|The IMF has {{reported}} that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in short-term securities and in the shadow banking system (particularly the mortgage market and real estate investment trusts). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth {{so as not to}} provoke investor withdrawal.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{a seminal}} paper, Rose (2000) emphasises the strong {{effect of the}} {{currency}} union membership on trade, controlling for exchange rate volatility. This effect is described as puzzling by Rose himself. If capital markets are incomplete and reluctant to finance trade imbalances, attempts at trade integration might be constrained by the degree of bilateral business cycle correlation. A contrario, complete monetary integration within <b>monetary</b> <b>unions</b> allows a relaxation of the current account constraint, a phenomenon that explains Rose's estimate of extra trade within <b>monetary</b> <b>unions,</b> which swells to three times the normal volume of trade. This paper provides evidence that monetary and fiscal co-ordinations matter not only within <b>monetary</b> <b>unions,</b> but also within any monetary setting, from floats to pegs.
