60|$|<b>My</b> <b>son</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had a quiet hour {{together}} on that happy night before we retired to rest. The little love-plot invented in George's interests now required one last stroke of diplomacy to complete it before we all threw off our masks and assumed our true characters for the future. When <b>my</b> <b>son</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> parted for the night, {{we had planned}} the necessary stratagem for taking our lovely guest by surprise {{as soon as she}} was out of her bed in the morning.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Talk faster, Pierre--this calmness freezes me. Tell me; for, by my soul, {{something}} most wonderful {{must have happened}} to thee. Thou art <b>my</b> <b>son,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> command thee. It is not Lucy; it is something else. Tell me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor am I," [...] said Christina. [...] "It is I who am utterly {{averse to}} this offer. <b>My</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are one in that; <b>and,</b> uncle, if <b>I</b> pray {{of you to}} consent to let us return to our castle, it is that I would not see the visit that has made us so happy stained with strife and dissension! Sure, sure, you cannot be angered with <b>my</b> <b>son</b> for his love for me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "You are <b>my</b> <b>son</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> beloved; <b>I</b> {{have chosen}} you for myself" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And am I {{to be out}} of the kissing, me {{that never}} lost a chance?" [...] says Alan; and putting me aside and taking Catriona by either shoulder, [...] "My dear," [...] he said, [...] "you're a true {{daughter}} of Alpin. By all accounts, he was a very fine man, and he may weel be proud of you. If ever I was to get married, it's the marrow of you I would be seeking for a mother to <b>my</b> <b>sons.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> bear a king's name and speak the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I observed, friend, {{that the}} house which <b>my</b> <b>son</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have taken as our {{quarters}} has excellent cellars; they can be imprisoned there for the present--that is, except the young lady, whom the Senor Adrian will look after. As it chances, she is his wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I am your mother, you are <b>my</b> <b>son,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{love you}} always,” she said, holding {{her hands over}} him; and he went away comforted and humbled in mind, as he thought of that amazing and {{constant}} love and tenderness with which this sweet lady ever blessed and pursued him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Hulton resumed in a shaky voice. [...] "I {{brought you}} here because you knew <b>my</b> <b>son</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wanted your support. Then I meant to {{convince}} Percival, whose help I may need to clear the boy's good name. We'll let that go {{and try to be}} practical." ...|$|E
60|$|I am so far {{a believer}} in a {{biological}} backbone for the college phase of education that I have secured it for <b>my</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have done all I can to extend it in England. Nevertheless, important as that formal college work was to me, it still {{seems to me that}} the informal part of our college life--the talk, the debates, the discussion, the scampering about London to attend great political meetings, to hear William Morris on Socialism, Auberon Herbert on Individualism, Gladstone on Home Rule, or Bradlaugh on Atheism--for those were the lights of my remote student days--was about equally important.|$|R
2500|$|The murder gained greater {{attention}} in the Capital District as Joan Porco, emerging from a medically induced coma, maintained that Christopher {{had nothing to do}} with her husband's murder. During videotaped testimony submitted to the grand jury in December 2004, Joan testified about her family, but did not identify her son as an attacker. Nine months later, she wrote a letter for publication in the Albany Times Union about Christopher: [...] "I implore the Bethlehem Police and the District Attorney's Office to leave <b>my</b> <b>son</b> alone, <b>and</b> to search for Peter's real killer or killers, so that he can rest in peace <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can live in safety." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{understand}} the terms {{to be as}} follows: [...] Parma is mine--my very own possession,-- [...] And as a counterquit, the guardianship [...] Is ceded to my father of <b>my</b> <b>son,</b> [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> keep out of France.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but we {{are very}} glad, <b>my</b> <b>son,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am sure you will be when you get away. You 're looking most dreadfully thin; is n't he, Mr. Mallet? It 's plain enough you need a change. I 'm sure we will go {{wherever}} you like. Where {{would you like to}} go?" ...|$|E
60|$|My Dear Sir,--Your {{remembrance of}} me, with sentiments {{of so much}} kindness, has given me the most sincere satisfaction. It {{perfectly}} agrees with the friendly and hospitable reception which <b>my</b> <b>son</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> received from you some time since, when, after an absence of twenty-two years, I had the happiness of embracing you, among my few surviving friends.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been {{promising}} myself {{right along}} that I'd {{come and see}} you fellows," [...] said John Franklin. [...] "But somehow I couldn't get around to it. But now that <b>my</b> <b>son</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{are going back to}} Texas I felt I'd have at least to say good-bye and thank you once again for what you fellows did for us." ...|$|E
5000|$|Once Khalid was deposed, the Emirates News Agency (WAM) {{reported}} {{the appointment of}} Sheikh Saud bin Saqr al-Qasimi as crown prince without delay, which gave the impression that Abu Dhabi approved of the appointment. No reaction was forthcoming from Dubai. Those close to Shaikh Saqr al-Qasimi, the Ruler of Ras al-Khaimah, said that {{despite the fact that}} he was at the time approaching 85, he was still with full faculties. As such, the pressure that Sheikh Khalid's supporters put on him to reverse his decision was futile. He said to those attempting to mediate in the affair at the time: [...] "These are <b>my</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am free to make my own decisions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Though {{there are}} twelve more," [...] {{continued}} Professor Maxon, [...] "you were <b>my</b> first born <b>son</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> loved you most, dear child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear son," [...] said Mr. Turveydrop, [...] "and dear daughter, I {{have done}} my duty. If {{the spirit of}} a sainted wooman hovers above us and looks down on the occasion, that, and your {{constant}} affection, will be my recompense. You will not fail in YOUR duty, <b>my</b> <b>son</b> <b>and</b> daughter, <b>I</b> believe?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} a {{dangerous}} error, <b>my</b> <b>son,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> carefully admonish thee against the evils of self-righteousness. That God selecteth his agents, is beyond dispute; {{but it is a}} fearful error to mistake the impulses of self-love, for the movements of his Divine Spirit! It is hardly safe for any who have not received the church's ordination, to deem themselves chosen vessels." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear ma'am,' said Mr Chester, 'you embolden {{me to be}} plain with you. <b>My</b> <b>son</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are at {{variance}} on this point. The young lady and her natural guardian differ upon it, also. And the closing point is, that my son is bound by his duty to me, by his honour, by every solemn tie and obligation, to marry some one else.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It almost seems," [...] he said slowly, smiling, [...] "as if thou didst {{not want}} me. If so, it is unfortunate; for I have long {{neglected}} {{my duty to}} <b>my</b> <b>son,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am resolved at last to repair that error. We accompany thee upon this expedition, Sakr-el-Bahr. Myself I will command it, and Marzak shall be my apprentice {{in the ways of}} the sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis well, <b>my</b> <b>son,</b> <b>and</b> even as <b>I</b> myself {{would have}} it; {{together}} we shall ride out, {{and where we}} ride, a trail of blood shall mark our way.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was one of}} {{my first}} {{thoughts}} when I was able to think," [...] the sheik said. [...] "Next to <b>my</b> wife, <b>my</b> <b>son,</b> <b>and</b> you, <b>I</b> love Zeila, <b>and</b> it would have sorely spoiled my joy that we are reunited, had she fallen in the battle. It was your advice that saved her life also." ...|$|R
5000|$|Once then {{returned}} to Linhuang, she wanted to divert the succession away from Yelü Bei, as she had favored Yelü Deguang. However, formally, she called an assembly of the chieftains, along with Yelü Bei and Yelü Deguang, and stated to them, [...] "I love both of <b>my</b> <b>sons,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do not know which one to make emperor. You can decide which one you wish to support by holding his rein." [...] The chieftains, knowing that she favored Yelü Deguang, rushed to him and held to his rein. She thereafter declared him emperor (as Emperor Taizong). Yelü Bei, angry over this turn of events, took several hundred soldiers and wanted to flee to Later Tang (Jin's successor state), but was intercepted by Khitan border guards. Empress Shulü did not punish him, but sent him to Dongdan.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, of course, it {{is natural}} that you should shield yourselves. But I know <b>my</b> <b>son,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> know {{he is not the}} person he has been made out to be by Doctor Clay and others. It was an outrage to allow the other boys at the school to get him into trouble as they did, and I have written to Doctor Clay to that effect." ...|$|E
60|$|JAMES. Now look here, Falder. <b>My</b> <b>son</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> want to {{give you}} another chance; but there are two things I must say to you. In the first place: It's no good coming here as a victim. If you've any notion that you've been {{unjustly}} treated--get rid of it. You can't play fast and loose with morality and hope to go scot-free. If Society didn't take care of itself, nobody would--the sooner you realise that the better.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, it is {{all very}} well for you to speak {{as if it were}} nothing!" [...] the marquis said. [...] "There are few men, indeed, who would throw {{themselves}} {{in the way of a}} mad dog, especially of such a formidable brute as that. You too have behaved with courage, <b>my</b> <b>son,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw you were ready to give your life for your sisters; but you had not the quickness and readiness of your friend, and would have been too late." ...|$|E
50|$|All my {{wearing apparel}} I give to <b>my</b> <b>son</b> Henry <b>and</b> the {{remainder}} of my estate, the whole being to <b>my</b> <b>sons</b> John <b>and</b> Henry, <b>I</b> give to my children my daughter Agnes having a double part.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not excusing myself. God {{knows how}} bitterly I have {{condemned}} myself, all these years. I {{only want to}} show you that I had no idea of condemning him to starvation. He was <b>my</b> only <b>son,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> loved him. I felt, perhaps, his rebellion all the more, because he had never before given me a day's trouble. I was harsh, obstinate, and cruel.|$|R
6000|$|... "The time was, when I {{would not}} weep. If I could, I would not. For a year, lady, after Senlac, I sat like a stone. I {{hardened}} my heart like {{a wall of}} brass, against God and man. Then, there upon the Flat-Holme, feeding on shell-fish, listening to the wail of the sea-fowl, looking outside the wan water for the sails which never came, my heart broke down in a moment. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> heard a voice crying, 'There is no help in man, go thou to God.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> answered, That were a beggar's trick, to go to God in need, when I went not to him in plenty. No. Without God <b>I</b> planned, <b>and</b> without Him <b>I</b> must fail. Without Him I went into the battle, <b>and</b> without Him <b>I</b> must bide the brunt. And at best, Can He give me back <b>my</b> <b>sons?</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> hardened <b>my</b> heart again like a stone, and shed no tear till I saw your fair face this day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Whitney, I {{am glad to}} hear, from you, {{that you}} are engaged to be married; and the {{circumstances}} which you tell me of make it a most interesting affair. If I were you, I should cut the constabulary. I enclose a paper from Wilson, giving you three weeks' leave. Come down to Sydney at once, and talk it over with me. You know I regard you as <b>my</b> <b>son,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{am going to have}} a voice in the matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{else was}} there to do?" [...] said Mr. Spugg when I asked him {{if it was true}} that Meadows was going. [...] "I take no credit for sending Meadows nor, for the matter of that, for {{anything}} that Meadows may do over there. It was a simple matter of duty. <b>My</b> <b>son</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had him into the dining room last night after dinner. 'Meadows,' we said, 'Henry and William are caught. Our man power at the front has got to be kept up. There's no one left but ourselves and you. There's no way out of it. You'll have to go.'" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{temple was}} builded by Solomon, a man peaceable and quiet; {{and that in}} name, by nature, and in governing. For so God had before told David, namely, that such a one the builder of the temple should be. 'Behold,' saith he, 'a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and {{quietness}} unto Israel in his days. He shall build an house for my name, and he shall be <b>my</b> <b>son,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will be his father' (1 Chron 22:9,10; Psa 72:1-4).|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, my dear. So do. Of {{course he}} {{is his own}} master. But he is <b>my</b> <b>son</b> as well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> cannot see him sacrificed without an effort to save him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been thinking, Harry," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "that as you {{are going}} away again, and, as the old woman says, you may not find us both here when you come back, it is right that I should {{tell you a little}} more about yourself. I once told you, years ago, that you were not <b>my</b> <b>son,</b> <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> would give you more {{particulars}} some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{read the}} letter, and {{determined}} on instant action. In a week <b>my</b> <b>son</b> Paul <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were on board my yacht, starting for the Mediterranean. We made for Palermo, {{and here we}} separated,--Paul, at all hazard, to find Count Hirsfeld, to whom I made a splendid offer if he would aid me in inducing Irene to change her purpose; I for Cruta, to see Irene.' ...|$|R
