5|$|A {{forensic}} {{examination of}} Docherty's body indicated she {{had probably been}} suffocated, but {{it could not be}} proven. Although the police suspected the men of other murders, there was no evidence on which they could take action. An offer was put to Hare granting immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence. He provided the details of Docherty's <b>murder</b> <b>and</b> confessed to all 16 deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one <b>murder</b> <b>and</b> sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven—a Scottish legal verdict to acquit an individual but not declare them innocent. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards, his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of Edinburgh Medical School where, as of 2017, it remains.|$|E
