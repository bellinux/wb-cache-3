5|$|A {{nobelium}} atom has 102 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. They {{are expected to be}} arranged in the configuration 5f147s2 (ground state term symbol 1S0), although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006. In forming compounds, all the three valence electrons <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost,</b> leaving behind a 5f13 core: this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. Nevertheless, {{it is more likely that}} only two valence electrons <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost,</b> leaving behind a stable 5f14 core with a filled 5f14 shell. The first ionization potential of nobelium was measured to be at most (6.65±0.07)eV in 1974, based on the assumption that the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones; this value has since not yet been refined further due to nobelium's scarcity and high radioactivity. The ionic radius of hexacoordinate and octacoordinate No3+ had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 90 and 102pm respectively; the ionic radius of No2+ has been experimentally found to be 100pm to two significant figures. The enthalpy of hydration of No2+ has been calculated as 1486kJ·mol−1.|$|E

5|$|Air Mata Iboe <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost.</b> Movies in the Indies were {{recorded}} on highly flammable nitrate film, {{and after a}} fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. Thus, the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider wrote that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.|$|E

5|$|In {{a period}} of two years, Oriental {{released}} four films; all were feature length, made in black-and-white, and received wide releases in the Dutch East Indies. Some, such as Panggilan Darah, enjoyed international release; the film was screened in Singapore (then part of the Straits Settlements) by September 1941. The company's productions were targeted at low-income audiences and extensively used kroncong music, for the recording of which the company established the Oriental Novelty Five. Though its films were screened at least into the 1950s, Oriental's output <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost.</b>|$|E
5|$|It has a {{low rate}} of fruiting, with less than 1% of flowers {{developing}} into follicles, {{and more than half}} of the inflorescences failing to form any follicles at all. Seed survival rates are similarly low. More than half of a plant's seed crop <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> to the larvae of moths and weevils, which burrow into the cobs to eat the seeds and pupate in the follicles; and further seed losses are caused by granivorous birds such as cockatoos, which break off the cobs to eat both the seeds and the insect larvae.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems. Certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric, although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated {{is very different from}} that in cells. By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition or a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer. This asymmetry <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> over time as lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to flip-flop.|$|E

5|$|The {{adult cattle}} egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> to starvation, calcium {{deficiency}} or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains {{a special relationship}} with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming {{is believed to be}} a major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.|$|E
5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 5f46d17s2. This {{differs from the}} configuration expected by the Aufbau principle in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This {{is because of the}} similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost,</b> leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the noble gas radon; more commonly, only some of the valence electrons will be lost. The electron configuration for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E

5|$|Drier {{parts of}} the country are highly prone to dust storms. These include areas west of Buenos Aires, which can average more than eight dust storms per year, and parts of Patagonia, owing to its aridity and windy climate. Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone to dust storms owing to {{extensive}} areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that erode the rock, which becomes a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind. Dust storms are more frequent during droughts, particularly in agricultural areas. Dust storms can effect large areas, leading to numerous impacts. These dust storms can lead to loss of crop and livestock, affecting the local economy. Productive topsoil <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> during dust storms, leading to loss in soil productivity, which can increase soil erosion and negatively affect crop productivity in the long term. In addition to the impact on agriculture, dust storms can damage cars and buildings, lower visibility on roads, affect air quality, and affect water quality in rivers and lakes.|$|E
5|$|End of Ages {{takes place}} in the present day, {{sometime}} after the events of , and begins as the player responds to a letter from Atrus. Atrus is a writer of special volumes called linking books, which serve as portals or links to worlds known as Ages. A linking book to the Age of Myst, the setting of the original game, lies sealed in the ruins of the ancient D'ni civilization. The D'ni had the ability to craft linking books, but their society crumbled from within; Atrus and his family have been trying to restore the D'ni people and created an Age for the survivors to live on, known as Releeshahn (introduced in Exile). Atrus by this period is an old man, mourning the deaths of his sons Sirrus and Achenar in Revelation, and the death of his wife Catherine in the period after. In his letter, Atrus expresses concern that his daughter, Yeesha, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|A {{mendelevium}} atom has 101 electrons, {{of which}} at least three (and perhaps four) can act as valence electrons. They {{are expected to be}} arranged in the configuration 5f137s2 (ground state term symbol 2F7/2), although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006. In forming compounds, three valence electrons <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost,</b> leaving behind a 5f12 core: this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of mendelevium was measured to be at most (6.58±0.07)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones; this value has since not yet been refined further due to mendelevium's scarcity and high radioactivity. The ionic radius of hexacoordinate Md3+ had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 91.2pm; 1988 calculations based on the logarithmic trend between distribution coefficients and ionic radius produced a value of 89.6pm, as well as an enthalpy of hydration of −(3654±12)kJ·mol−1. Md2+ should have an ionic radius of 115pm and hydration enthalpy −1413kJ·mol−1; Md+ should have ionic radius 117pm.|$|E
