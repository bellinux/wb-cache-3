5|$|Due to the {{impending}} threat of Dot, storm signals were raised {{along the north}} and central Philippines. The metropolis of Manila was placed on typhoon alert, forcing the <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> emergency crews. Seven domestic and two military flights were called off. Additionally, railway and shipping services were cancelled. All United States military installations in the Philippines were placed in a Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness and two airbases, Clark Air Base and Cubi Point NAS, were evacuated. Schools and many offices were shut down in preparation of Dot.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of October 5/6, Zvi Zamir went to Europe to meet {{personally}} with Ashraf Marwan, an Egyptian double agent. Marwan informed Zamir that a joint Egyptian-Syrian attack was imminent. Combined with other warnings and incidents, Marwan's warning finally convinced Zvi Zamir of the imminence of war. Eli Zeira, the director of Aman, sent a definite warning of war to the Israeli leadership at 04:30 on October 6. Aman erred when it concluded the Arabs were to attack at 18:00, an estimation in fact four hours late. Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir met with Defence Minister Moshe Dayan and General David Elazar at 08:05 for over an hour. Meir asked both men to present their views, which were conflicting: Dayan continued to believe war was not a certainty, while Elazar believed otherwise, arguing for a preemptive air strike against Syria. Dayan also proposed a partial <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> reserves, while Elazar favored a <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> the entire Air Force, and four armored divisions, totaling around 100,000–120,000 troops. Meir concluded the meeting by stating that no preemptive strike would be launched, {{in order to ensure}} the backing of the United States, but she sided with Elazar on the issue of mobilization, and orders were issued to reservists to mobilize.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for a war against Bohemia, Louis ordered the <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> the royal army and marched to Trencsén (now Trenčín in Slovakia). However, his supposed allies (Rudolf IV of Austria, Meihnard III of Tyrol and Casimir III of Poland) failed to join him, and the emperor initiated negotiations that lasted for months with the mediation of Casimir III. Louis was finally reconciled with Charles IV at their meeting in Uherské Hradiště on 8 May 1363.|$|E

Northern attention was focused on immigration and World War I. The convict lease system finally ended {{with the advent of}} World War II.

5|$|Indiana {{participated in}} the <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> the nation's economy and resources. Domestically, the state {{produced}} munitions in an army plant near Sellersburg. The P-47 fighter-plane was manufactured in Evansville at Republic Aviation. The steel produced in northern Indiana was used in tanks, battleships, and submarines. Other war-related materials were produced throughout the state. Indiana's military bases were activated, with areas such as Camp Atterbury reaching historical peaks in activity.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the war had}} a {{significantly}} {{negative impact on the}} Australia economy. Real aggregate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined by 9.5 per cent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> personnel resulted in a 6 per cent decline in civilian employment. Meanwhile, although population growth continued during the war years, it was only half that of the prewar rate. Per capita incomes also declined sharply, falling by 16 per cent.|$|E

40|$|The {{political}} {{performances of}} Dutch anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders revolve around {{a combination of}} giving and taking offense. In this article, I develop a critique of Wilders’ politics of offense by revisiting two classic texts of Frankfurt School critical theory that combine social theory with psychoanalysis: Herbert Marcuse’s 1965 essay, “Repressive Tolerance” and Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno’s chapter, “Elements of Anti-Semitism: Limits of Enlightenment” from Dialectic of Enlightenment. Both texts seek to understand reactionary <b>mobilizations</b> <b>of</b> political affect in relation to dominant forms of liberalism that do {{not live up to}} their promise of realizing freedom. I will demonstrate how this comprehensive approach makes revisiting these texts useful for critiquing reactionary <b>mobilizations</b> <b>of</b> political affect in the present...|$|R
5|$|Research on the {{treatment}} of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP. Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> {{a small fraction of}} the total estimated body mercury. DMSA was able to increase the excretion of mercury to a greater extent than NAP.|$|E
5|$|The {{abortive}} {{attack on}} Montreal {{led to the}} full <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> local militia in Montreal, raising nearly 1,000 men, but they soon began to drift away. Carleton refused to organize an expedition in relief of Fort Saint-Jean, and the militia members from rural parishes eventually disbanded to attend to their harvests and the defense of their own homes. In November, the besieged fort's commander capitulated, opening the Americans' way to Montreal. Carleton fled the city, making his way to Quebec City, and Montgomery occupied Montreal without firing a shot on November 13.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} August, the <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> {{the fleet}} was complete; Kaiser Karl VI was {{assigned}} to the Cruiser Flotilla, which was commanded by Vice Admiral Paul Fiedler. For most of the war, the Cruiser Flotilla and based at Cattaro, though the armored cruisers were too slow to operate with the newer s that carried out the bulk of offensive operations. In May 1915, Italy declared war on the Central Powers. The Austro-Hungarians continued their strategy of serving as a fleet in being, which would tie down the now further numerically superior Allied naval forces. Haus hoped that torpedo boats and mines could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the Italian fleet before a decisive battle could be fought.|$|E
5|$|Cortisol is {{the main}} {{glucocorticoid}} in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. This {{is the result of}} an increase in the <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of free fatty acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{historian}} Mark Humphries of Canada's Memorial University of Newfoundland {{stated that}} newly unearthed records confirmed {{that one of}} the side stories of the war, the <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> 96,000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines on World War I's western front, might have been the source of the pandemic. In the report, Humphries found archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu. However, a report published in 2016 in the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association found no evidence that the 1918 virus was imported to Europe from Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers. In fact, it found evidence that the virus had been circulating in the European armies for months and potentially years before the 1918 pandemic.|$|E

5|$|Matthias's {{ordinary}} revenues amounted around 250,000 golden florins {{per year}} when his reign began. A decree passed at the Diet of 1458 explicitly prohibited {{the imposition of}} extraordinary taxes. However, an extraordinary taxone golden florin per each porta or peasant householdwas levied late that year. The Ottomans occupied the fort of Golubac in Serbia in August 1458; Matthias ordered the <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> all noblemen. He made a raid into Ottoman territory and defeated the enemy forces in minor skirmishes. King Stephen Thomas of Bosnia accepted Matthias's suzerainty. Matthias authorized his new vassal's son Stephen Tomašević to take possession of the parts of Serbia {{that had not been}} occupied by the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|Other, more {{invasive}} procedures, {{also exist}} for larger bone defects including <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> the inferior alveolar nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay bone grafting using the iliac crest or another large source of bone and microvascular bone graft where {{the blood supply}} to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and reconnected to the local blood supply. The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm loss) or severe (greater than 6mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.|$|E

5|$|The Red Guards, led by Ali Aaltonen, {{refused to}} {{recognise}} the Whites Guard's power status, {{and decided to}} establish a military authority of their own. Aaltonen placed the Red power base in Helsinki. The Red Order of Revolution was issued on 26 January 1918, and a red lantern, a symbolic indicator of the Uprising, was lit in the tower of the Helsinki Workers' Hall. The large scale <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> the Reds {{began in the late}} evening of 27 January, with the Helsinki Guard and some of the Guards located along the Viipuri-Tampere railway having become active between 23–26 January, in order to safeguard vital positions and escort a heavy railroad shipment of Bolsheviks' weapons from Petrograd to Finland. White troops tried to capture the shipment; 20–30 Finns, Red and White, died in the Battle of Kämärä in the Karelian Isthmus on 27 January 1918.|$|E
5|$|The borders {{were still}} not {{finalized}} in June 1880 when a proposal very favorable to Greece that included Mount Olympus and Ioannina was {{offered by the}} British and French. When the Ottoman Turks strenuously objected, Prime Minister Trikoupis {{made the mistake of}} threatening a <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> the Hellenic Army. A coincident change of government in France, the resignation of Charles de Freycinet and his replacement with Jules Ferry, led to disputes among the Great Powers and, despite British support for a more pro-Greek settlement, the Turks subsequently granted Greece all of Thessaly but only the part of Epirus around Arta. When the government of Trikoupis fell, the new prime minister, Alexandros Koumoundouros, reluctantly accepted the new boundaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{branches}} of the silver birch often have tangled masses of twigs known as witch's brooms growing among them, caused by the fungus Taphrina betulina. Old trees are often killed by the decay fungus Piptoporus betulinus and fallen branches rot rapidly on the forest floor. This tree commonly grows with the mycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria in a mutualistic relationship. This applies particularly to acidic or nutrient-poor soils. Other mycorrhizal associates include Leccinum scabrum and Cantharellus cibarius. It has been shown that, as well as mycorrhiza, the presence of microfauna in the soil assists {{the growth of the}} tree, as it enhances the <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> nutrients.|$|E
