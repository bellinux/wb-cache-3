5|$|In humans, body {{temperature}} is typically highest during {{the mid to}} late afternoon. However, human athletes being tested for physical vigor on exercise machines showed no statistically significant difference after lunch. Owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an east–west (as opposed to north–south) orientation to house their livestock, because an east–west orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's acute angle and intense glare during late afternoon. When these animals are too hot, they are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> belligerent and unproductive.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is indicated}} as an adjunctive (additional) treatment {{in children with}} drug-resistant epilepsy. It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland, England and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. Children with a focal lesion (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for surgery are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycaemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults. A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are tube-fed.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, {{but it is a}} liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.|$|E

25|$|Adoption {{studies also}} suggest a strong genetic {{tendency}} towards alcoholism. Studies on children {{separated from their}} biological parents demonstrates that sons of alcoholic biological fathers were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> alcoholic, {{even though they have}} been separated and raised by non alcoholic parents. Female show similar results, but to a lesser degree.|$|E
25|$|Bedwetting alarms: Physicians also {{frequently}} suggest bedwetting alarms which sound a loud tone when they sense moisture. This can help condition {{the child to}} wake at the sensation of a full bladder. These alarms are considered effective, with study participants being 13 times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> dry at night. There is a 29% to 69% relapse rate, however, so the treatment {{may need to be}} repeated.|$|E

30|$|In {{this final}} {{hypothesis}} we predict that higher entrepreneurial skills lead {{a person to}} have a higher entrepreneur identity aspiration.

40|$|Despite {{a common}} belief, service {{learning}} {{is completely different}} from community service. Service learning is different from community service because not only is working being accomplished in a community, but also students are learning how to apply service to their everyday lives as citizens of the community. Active citizenship is an essential skill to add to higher education curriculums because the students graduating are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> going <b>to</b> <b>become</b> our future leaders...|$|R
25|$|Obese {{children}} and adolescents are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> obese as adults. For example, {{one study found that}} approximately 80% of children who were overweight at aged 10–15 years were obese adults at age 25 years. Another study found that 25% of obese adults were overweight as children. The latter study also found that if overweight begins before 8 years of age, obesity in adulthood is likely to be more severe.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoid hormones have an {{important}} role in regulating aggressive behavior. In adult rats, acute injections of corticosterone promote aggressive behavior and acute reduction of corticosterone decreases aggression; however, a chronic reduction of corticosterone levels can produce abnormally aggressive behavior. In addition, glucocorticoids affect development of aggression and establishment of social hierarchies. Adult mice with low baseline levels of corticosterone are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> dominant than are mice with high baseline corticosterone levels.|$|E
25|$|Historians in {{the early}} 20th century, such as J. Franklin Jameson, {{examined}} the class composition of the Patriot cause, looking for evidence of a class war inside the revolution.

Just as there were rich and poor Loyalists, the Patriots were a 'mixed lot', with the richer and better educated <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> officers in the Army.|$|E

25|$|However, {{even after}} {{accounting}} for sampling bias, there {{does appear to}} be a gradual decrease in extinction and origination rates during the Phanerozoic. This may represent the fact that groups with higher turnover rates are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> extinct by chance; or it may be an artefact of taxonomy: families tend to become more speciose, therefore less prone to extinction, over time; and larger taxonomic groups (by definition) appear earlier in geological time.|$|E
25|$|Childhood {{environments that}} are {{physically}} violent, emotionally unsupportive and characterized by competition for scarce resources {{have been associated}} with sexual violence. Sexually aggressive behavior in young men, for instance, has been linked to witnessing family violence, and having emotionally distant and uncaring fathers. Men raised in families with strongly patriarchal structures are also <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> violent, to rape and use sexual coercion against women, as well as to abuse their intimate partners, than men raised in homes that are more egalitarian.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{the problem}} of foam shed had not been fully cured; on STS-114, {{additional}} cameras mounted on the tank recorded a piece of foam separated from one of its Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramps, which are designed to prevent unsteady air flow underneath the tank’s cable trays and pressurization lines during ascent. The PAL ramps consist of manually sprayed layers of foam, and are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a source of debris. That piece of foam did not impact the orbiter.|$|E
30|$|We also observe {{interesting}} {{differences for}} professions. For example, being a philosopher has the strongest {{positive effect on}} being of global importance (IRR = 4.8, p < 0.001), while being a journalist has the strongest negative effect on global importance (IRR = 0.37, p < 0.001). This indicates that people with certain professions are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be recognized globally if they contributed something, while others are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be recognized locally. While we do observe interesting differences among professions, further analysis is necessary to investigate whether professional differences in notability are confounded by the average birth decade. For instance, {{a quarter of the}} top 100 historical figures are philosophers [26], while journalists are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>become</b> famous in recent years.|$|R
30|$|Entrepreneurial skills {{had a very}} high, {{positive}} impact on Entrepreneur Identity Aspiration (beta[*]=[*] 0.67).

25|$|Aggression {{between groups}} is {{determined}} partly by willingness to fight, which {{depends on a}} number of factors including numerical advantage, distance from home territories, how often the groups encounter each other, competitive abilities, differences in body size, and whose territory is being invaded. Also, an individual is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> aggressive if other aggressive group members are nearby. One particular phenomenon– the formation of coordinated coalitions that raid neighbouring territories to kill conspecifics– has only been documented in two species in the animal kingdom: 'common' chimpanzees and humans.|$|E
25|$|Numerous seeds {{develop in}} hairy follicles over the {{following}} months. Orites revolutus may be heavily infested by the seed parasite Symphygas nephaula, which lays its eggs in the developing flower bud before the seed pods have formed. After hatching, the larvae feed on the maturing seeds as they become available. Orites revolutus is a preferred host for this tortricid moth borer as compared to O. acicularis, which has a heavily overlapping range, and plants at lower altitudes are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> infested. It is thought that this parasite {{may be the most}} important agent of predispersal seed loss in the plant.|$|E

30|$|Here, {{the role}} of {{technicians}} and teachers may be relevant.

In 1942, to meet harvest quotas, over half of the agricultural labor force was made up of women. They were not only assuming roles on collective farms, but 8,476 girls went into the Red army and Soviet navy to assist in the Great Patriotic War. The motto of the time became, “Soviet women gave all their strengthen to the motherland…no difficulties arising on the path to building peace could frighten them.” ...|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} factor determining social mobility in Finland was education. Children who attained {{a higher level of}} education than their parents were often able to rise in the hierarchy of occupations. A tripling or quadrupling in any one generation of the numbers receiving schooling beyond the required minimum reflected the needs of a developing economy for skilled employees. Obtaining advanced training or education was easier for some than for others, however, and the children of white-collar employees still were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> white-collar employees themselves than were the children of farmers and blue-collar workers. In addition, children of white-collar professionals were more likely than not to remain in that class.|$|E
25|$|Organisms need to {{replicate}} their genetic material in an efficient and reliable manner. The necessity to repair genetic damage {{is one of}} the leading theories explaining the origin of sexual reproduction. Diploid individuals can repair a damaged section of their DNA via homologous recombination, since there are two copies of the gene in the cell and one copy is presumed to be undamaged. A mutation in a haploid individual, on the other hand, is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> resident, as the DNA repair machinery has no way of knowing what the original undamaged sequence was. The most primitive form of sex may have been one organism with damaged DNA replicating an undamaged strand from a similar organism in order to repair itself.|$|E
25|$|Biological {{transmission}} {{requires a}} period of incubation of the trypanosomes within the tsetse host. The term 'biological' is used because trypanosomes must reproduce through several generations inside the tsetse host {{during the period of}} incubation, which requires extreme adaptation of the trypanosomes to their tsetse host. In this mode of transmission, trypanosomes reproduce through several generations, changing in morphology at certain periods. This mode of transmission also includes the sexual phase of the trypanosomes. Tsetse are believed to be <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> infected by trypanosomes during their first few blood meals. Tsetse infected by trypanosomes are thought to remain infected for the remainder of their lives. Because of the adaptations required for biological transmission, trypanosomes transmitted biologically by tsetse cannot be transmitted in this manner by other insects.|$|E
