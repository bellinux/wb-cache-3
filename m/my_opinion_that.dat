My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of <b>my</b> <b>opinion.</b> <b>That</b> was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.|$|E

However, he noted another issue which had some influence on {{the production of the}} album - the issue of which songs to include. As the band had only released five albums, they were forced to mostly include the singles they had previously released.|$|E

500|$|Revenge was {{mentioned}} {{after the game}} by Flyers Head Coach Ken Hitchcock. During a post-game interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), he commented that [...] "someday, someone's {{going to make him}} eat his lunch. This is something, in <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> <b>that</b> the players should take care of." [...] Recchi also mentioned revenge, not specifically from the Flyers, during an interview with the CBC. [...] "It doesn't surprise me coming from this guy. He's that type of player. He's done it before. It might not come from our team. But he better protect himself," [...] said Recchi.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{writing at}} the end of the nineteenth century praised Planché with sentiments such as [...] " [...] raised {{theatrical}} extravaganza and burlesque to the dignity of a fine art, and wrote verses to be sung on the stage which could be read with pleasure in the study." [...] and [...] "I am quite certain that such masters of lyrical writing as W. S. Gilbert ... would confirm me in <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> the songs and lyrics in the extravaganzas of Planché were as faultless in tone, tact and taste as they were rhythmically perfect". (The converse was also true; Planché approved of, and strongly influenced Gilbert's works) Planché's dramatic reputation was already fading before his death, and continued to do so in the twentieth century. He is still remembered for his influence on and contributions to British theatre over a long career.|$|E

500|$|Hendrix {{completed}} his paratrooper training {{in just over}} eight months, and Major General C.W.G. Rich awarded him the prestigious Screaming Eagles patch on January 11, 1962. By February, his personal conduct had begun to draw criticism from his superiors. They labeled him an unqualified marksman and often caught him napping while on duty and failing to report for bed checks. On May 24, Hendrix's platoon sergeant, James C. Spears, filed a report in which he stated: [...] "He has no interest whatsoever in the Army... It is <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> Private Hendrix will never {{come up to the}} standards required of a soldier. I feel that the military service will benefit if he is discharged as soon as possible." [...] On June 29, 1962, Captain Gilbert Batchman granted Hendrix an honorable discharge on the basis of unsuitability. Hendrix later spoke of his dislike of the army and falsely stated that he had received a medical discharge after breaking his ankle during his 26th parachute jump.|$|E
500|$|... "Paranoid Android" [...] is {{categorised}} {{by three}} distinct moods written in what Yorke {{referred to as}} three different states of mind. The song's lyrics tie in {{with a number of}} themes common in OK Computer, including insanity, violence, slogans, and political objection to capitalism. Yorke's lyrics were based on an unpleasant experience at a Los Angeles bar during which he was surrounded by strangers high on cocaine. In particular, Yorke was frightened by a woman who became violent after someone spilled a drink on her. Yorke characterised the woman as [...] "inhuman", and said [...] "There was a look in this woman's eyes that I'd never seen before anywhere.... Couldn't sleep that night because of it." [...] The woman inspired the line [...] "kicking squealing Gucci little piggy" [...] in the song's second section. Yorke, referring to the line [...] "With your opinions, which are of no consequence at all", said that [...] "Again, that's just a joke. It's actually the other way around– it's actually <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> is of no consequence at all." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1943, Kesselring {{met with}} Hitler. Kesselring gave an optimistic {{assessment}} {{of the situation in}} Italy and gave reassurances that he could hold the Allies south of Rome on the Winter Line. Kesselring further promised that he could prevent the Allies reaching the Northern Apennines for at least six months. As a result, on 6 November 1943, Hitler ordered Rommel and his Army Group B headquarters to move to France to take charge of the Atlantic Wall and prepare for the Allied attack that was expected there in the spring of 1944. On 21 November 1943, Kesselring resumed command of all German forces in Italy, combining Commander-in-Chief South, a joint command, with that of Army Group C, a ground command. [...] "I had always blamed Kesselring", Hitler later explained, [...] "for looking at things too optimistically ... events have proved Rommel wrong, and I have been justified in my decision to leave Field Marshal Kesselring there, whom I have seen as an incredible political idealist, but also as a military optimist, and it is <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> military leadership without optimism is not possible." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for The Washington Post, Jerry Doolittle {{thought that}} Bond is [...] "still irresistible to women, still {{handsome}} in a menacing way, still charming. He has nerves {{of steel and}} thews of whipcord", even if [...] "he's starting {{to look a little}} older." [...] Doolittle was fulsome in his praise for the novel, saying [...] "Fleming's new book will not disappoint his millions of fans". Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by a Fleming biographer, John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—was again damning, although even he admitted that [...] "you can't argue with success". However, {{he went on to say}} that [...] "simply pro forma, I must set down <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> this is a silly and tedious novel." [...] Boucher went on to bemoan that although On Her Majesty's Secret Service was better than The Spy Who Loved Me, [...] "it is still a lazy and inadequate story", going on to say that [...] "my complaint is not that the adventures of James Bond are bad literature... but that they aren't good bad literature". Boucher finished his review lamenting that [...] "they just aren't writing bad books like they used to." ...|$|E
500|$|Chivers is {{best known}} for his {{association}} with Edgar Allan Poe and, in fact, it is through this relationship that Chivers and his work was rediscovered in the 20th century. The first interaction between the two was in 1840 though they did not meet until 1845 in New York. The two became friends and Chivers was willing to give Poe lifetime financial support if he moved to the South. Chivers appreciated Poe's ability and wrote that George Rex Graham was seriously underpaying Poe for his work on Graham's Magazine. [...] "He ought to give you ten thousand dollars a year... It is richly worth it... is greatly indebted to you. It is not <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> you have ever been, or ever will be, paid for your intellectual labours. You need never expect it, until you establish a Magazine of your own", he wrote, referring to Poe's plans to begin The Stylus. Even so, Chivers was concerned about Poe's reputation as a severe literary critic, cautioning him about [...] "when you tomahawk people". Poe, in fact, had been hoping Chivers would lend his wealth as a financial backer for The Stylus and possibly even serve as a co-editor in its early planning stages. Chivers considered Poe's proposal but was not able to accept because of the death of his three-year-old daughter just over a week later.|$|E
500|$|When the {{production}} company {{first arrived in}} Los Angeles, {{the cast and crew}} were [...] "intimidated" [...] by Scientologists. Scientology officials had previously visited the New York City production in the midst of rehearsals and handed out [...] "documentation of court cases where the Church of Scientology had successfully prosecuted those seeking to disparage the Church's methods." [...] Director/creator Alex Timbers characterized these events as [...] "terrifically wonderful and intimidating". Editors from the Los Angeles Times received phone calls from Scientologists urging them not to write about the play. [...] In addition, the parents of one of the children from the cast received phone calls from members of the entertainment industry who were Scientologists. The parents of these cast members were told that if their children performed in the play, [...] "it might be bad for their future career." [...] The parents politely informed these callers [...] "We read the script, and we don't think it is mean-spirited ... We understand your concerns, but we don't share your concerns." [...] When asked by Variety magazine for the Church's official take on the play, a Los Angeles Church of Scientology spokeswoman was quoted as saying: [...] "This is not litigation material. This is nothing." [...] In a 2007 interview, Jarrow commented on the Church of Scientology's history of responses to productions of the play: [...] "It's clear the Church doesn't like the show—but in <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> kind of controversy is evidence that the show's hitting a nerve and dealing with pertinent issues.

S by Shakira though has managed to make another fan". Kim West from Beauty World News felt the perfume was truly reflective of Shakira's nature, saying [...] "Full of energy, sensuality, and good vibrations, S by Shakira bottles the singer's essence and what makes her unique". In 2013, Latina magazine included S by Shakira on their list of [...] "The 11 Best Latino Celebrity Perfumes" [...] and found the perfume [...] "perfect" [...] for romantic occasions, calling it [...] "energetic, confident, and so sexy thanks to the vanilla and sandalwood notes". At the 2010 Academia Del Perfume Award ceremony sponsored by The Fragrance Foundation, S by Shakira won the award for [...] "Best Women's Fragrance Great Distribution". The award was received by Pilar Trabal, vice president of Puig Iberia, and Shakira thanked the jury and voters through a telephone call. At the 2011 FiFi Awards ceremony sponsored by The Fragrance Foundation, S by Shakira received a nomination in the category of [...] "Women's Broad Appeal" [...] but lost to American actress Halle Berry's fragrance Pure Orchid. Commercially, industry analysts predicted that S by Shakira would make $35 to $45 million through global retail sales in its first year.|$|E
500|$|According to Douglas Jardine's biographer, Christopher Douglas, [...] " [...] hardly put a foot wrong {{during the}} tour and, {{even though he}} gave Australia their biggest hiding to date, he was and {{probably}} remains... {{one of the most}} popular English captains to tour Australia." [...] From the opening games, England followed a strategy of accumulating large totals. For the first Test, to strengthen the team's batting, Chapman and the tour selection committee chose only three specialist bowlers; as the Tests were [...] "timeless"—played to a finish with no time limit—he believed batting to be the key to victory. England batted first and scored 521; Chapman scored 50, but critics believed he should have batted more cautiously. When Australia began their innings, he held a catch from Bill Woodfull in the gully which several observers rated as among the best they had seen. Sydney Southerton, writing of the English fielding, said: [...] "The high note was struck by Chapman himself at Brisbane when, with a catch that will be historic, he dismissed Woodfull... It is <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> catch had a pronounced effect on the course of events in the three subsequent Tests ... exercised a most restraining influence on the Australian batsmen." [...] Australia were bowled out for 122; Chapman did not ask Australia to follow-on but batted again, to the crowd's displeasure, and his batsmen relentlessly built up the England lead. When Chapman became the first captain to declare an innings closed in a timeless Test match, Australia needed 742 to win. On a rain-affected pitch, Australia were bowled out for 66; England's win by 675 runs remains in 2016 the largest margin of victory by runs in Tests.|$|E
