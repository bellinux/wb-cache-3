25|$|By {{the turn}} of the century the Christchurch City Council was {{strongly}} in favour of bringing the tramways under municipal control but only on its own terms. This ignited suspicion amongst Christchurch City's neighbouring boroughs – through whose territory such a system would have to be built even if only to replace the existing private network – that they would have no control over the running of such a system. A series of tramway conferences were held from the mid-1890s for the local bodies involved to advance the cause of <b>municipalisation</b> but it was not until March 1902 that the City Council acquiesced to the demands of its neighbours for a tramway board with elected members. The Tramway Conference had received an offer to construct and operate an electric tramway system from the British Electric Traction Company (the same company that had the contract for the Auckland system) in February but, despite public support for the proposal, declined as they were already in favour of municipal control.|$|E
60|$|Fabian {{socialism}} was {{the first}} systematic attempt to meet the fatal absence of administrative schemes in the earlier socialisms. It can scarcely be regarded now as anything but an interesting failure, but a failure that has all the educational value of a first reconnaissance into unexplored territory. Starting from that attack on aggregating property, which is the common starting-point of all socialist projects, the Fabians, appalled at the obvious difficulties of honest confiscation and an open transfer from private to public hands, conceived the extraordinary idea of filching property for the state. A small body of people of extreme astuteness were {{to bring about the}} <b>municipalisation</b> and nationalisation first of this great system of property and then of that, in a manner so artful that the millionaires were to wake up one morning at last, and behold, they would find themselves poor men! For a decade or more Mr. Pease, Mr. Bernard Shaw, Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb, Mrs. Besant, Dr. Lawson Dodd, and their associates of the London Fabian Society, did pit their wits and ability, or at any rate the wits and ability of their leisure moments, against the embattled capitalists of England and the world, in this complicated and delicate enterprise, without any apparent diminution of the larger accumulations of wealth. But in addition they developed another side of Fabianism, still more subtle, which professed {{to be a kind of}} restoration in kind of property to the proletariat and in this direction they were more successful. A dexterous use, they decided, was to be made of the Poor Law, the public health authority, the education authority, and building regulations and so forth, to create, so to speak, a communism of the lower levels. The mass of people whom the forces of change had expropriated were to be given a certain minimum of food, shelter, education, and sanitation, and this, the socialists were assured, could be used as the thin end of the wedge towards a complete communism. The minimum, once established, could obviously be raised continually until either everybody had what they needed, or the resources of society gave out and set a limit to the process.|$|E

50|$|When the {{concessions}} {{under which the}} lines of the private tramway companies were operated came up for renewal from the late 1890s, the various local bodies involved saw it as an opportunity to consider <b>municipalisation</b> of the whole system.

[...] In addition, the number of parks and public baths were increased, London’s sewerage system was improved, roads were widened and paved, and the Blackwall Tunnel, linking the Isle of Dogs with Greenwich, was opened in 1897.

Indeed, on many issues he had more in common with the emerging Independent Labour Party than many members of his own party. On 29 January 1904, the Manchester Guardian quoted him as stating that it was a public duty {{on the part of both}} local and central government to relieve distress. Boyle was, of course, an advocate of Irish independence, but he believed that Home Rule could be achieved constitutionally through the activities of the Irish National Party in the Imperial Parliament.

40|$|Modernization {{of local}} {{government}} leads inevitably to the vexed {{question of how to}} structure local government to meet the changed circumstances in which it operates. This acknowledgement is no less so for the Caribbean in general and Jamaica in particular, where forces such as increased suburbanization and higher level of citizen demands on local government have prompted policy to respond to the changing world {{of local government}}. The recalibration of local government structure serves key objectives – to achieve economies of scale; to assure organisational viability and to reinvigorate local democracy. The Portmore Municipal Council (PMC) in Jamaica, enacted by the Municipalities Act of 2003 is representative of fragmentation of local government and innovates local policy and administration in two ways: (a) popular election of Mayor; and (b) construction of local/community self-management institutional arrangements.

40|$|Local {{cultural}} {{policies in}} France became institutionalised essentially over two decades: the 1970 s and the 1980 s. This institutionalisation process comprised the cultural specialisation of local administrative services, the professionalisation of local cultural agents {{and the promotion}} of culture as one of the mains sectors for local public policies, from the political as well as financial point of view. Based upon the case study of a middle-sized town, this article shows that this was a conflictual process. In the late 1960 s and early 1970 s, association activists from the new middle classes, politically and culturally close to the political mobilisations of the post- 1968 period, launched programmes of cultural action. At first, the <b>municipalisation</b> of their policy was a success for them. However, progressively, this local cultural policy was driven less and less by these former activists, who were replaced by new professionals, and earlier socio-cultural and political ambitions (revolving, for example, around a culture of everyday life designed to promote greater local democracy) were replaced by a more technical orientation. Finally, this instituionalisation process also consisted of the dispossession and disillusion of those who had believed they could change social and political relations through cultural involvement...|$|E
40|$|Before liberal reform, rustic {{property}} {{was the main}} source of income of Extremadura’s local finance. Thanks to it, the town hall of this region defrayed the own expenses of municipal administration and part of the taxes which might be paid by means of neighbouring apportionment. The <b>municipalisation</b> of the apportionments did not imply equality in the fiscal discharge, but, at least, mitigated the Royal Finance’s pressure over the common run of population. The crusade which was started in Spain against the rustic municipal patrimony {{from the middle of the}} 18 th century, concreted in the civil disentitlement since 1855, obliged to repair the accounts of Extremadura’s local finance by way of other financing methods more burdensome to the community. These methods, characterised by the extra load over the State duty from 1845, ended up by imposing a new budget structure of fiscal nature which, besides hindering the development of the services linked to local finance, reinforced the taxation discrimination of the most unfortunate layer of Extremadura’s society.

It is sustained that, in the fi eld of the orientations towards action, the political will to institute a new local governance model, which we designate as socio communitarian regulation, is visible, although it cannot be generalized. Some critical discourses that look at this process as a way of contributing to take away the State’s responsibility, of “privatizing” education and of <b>municipalisation</b> are summarily analysed.

40|$|Introduction: The {{number of}} {{students}} with school refusal has remained at a constant level in Sweden since measurements began in 2006. School health service resources has been reduced since <b>municipalisation</b> which {{makes it difficult to}} intercept these students in time. Objective: To identify the tools of school health services, resources and professional skills with unauthorized absence, and the measures applied preventively. Method: A qualitative study based on seven semi-structured interviews with all professions within the school health services. Results: The school's responsibility affect both student health organization and the student's school structure. The new grades and subject schemes introduced in 2011 make higher requirements on today's students. It´s important that all of the school personell are aware of the problem and pursue the same objectives, for a good interaction. Discussion: School health services shared experiences around the concept school refusal behavior reflects the complexity of the problem. Knowledge and skills are important components. The school teams experience that they are self-taught regarding the subject but want further education and increased resources to be more preventive and relationship-building. Conclusion: Further Swedish research and knowledge is needed, as well as an improved definition of the concept in order to improve school health service’s work with school refusal students in student.

40|$|Water {{supplies}} {{built to}} serve Britain’s town {{populations in the}} early nineteenth century were mostly privately owned and financed by share offers allowed by Acts of Parliament. This system came under intense pressure as populations increased; supplies were often intermittent, few poorer households were connected and there was a lack of water for fire fighting and street cleansing. At a national level, the majority of water supply companies were bought by local authorities in the latter half of the century. However in a handful of towns and cities, the water supply remained in private hands. The current study explores the history of Bristol Water Works Company between the period of its incorporation in 1846 and 1890. Despite performance difficulties early in the period, national policy favouring local authority ownership and several purchase attempts, the company resisted and still exists as a private company to this day. The study explores how and why the company was successful in this resistance at a time when so many others were not. It suggests the value of exploring such local governance ‘anomalies’ and the conditions that gave rise to them, because of the way in which they can cast new light on our understanding of the local and national factors that underlay <b>municipalisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Assistance {{should not}} only be {{regarded}} as a duty for the secular or ecclesiastical urban elites. It could also turn into a real stake for power, and sometimes, assistance can even be considered a form of urban power per se. In 1515, the master of Our Lady’s Hospital of Seclin took an oath of submission to the master of the Hôpital Comtesse. Founded in 1237 by Countess Johanna of Constantinople, the so-called Hôpital Comtesse was a very strong economic power with a very unique institutional structure. It maintained close relationships with many charitable houses, not only in the town itself, but also in its castellany. The Hôpital Comtesse’s master was often an auditor de officio of those places. He also received the vows of the brothers and sisters of the hospital community. Historiography has often presented hospitals as being characterised by a process of <b>municipalisation</b> {{at the end of the}} Middle Ages. On the contrary, in Lille, aldermen were strictly prohibited from interfering with the Hôpital Comtesse’s affairs. Moreover, this oath could reveal a desire for the Hôpital Comtesse to be not just a religious authority through vows, but also an urban power, with some well-known attributes. Indeed, this single oath, discovered in the archives of Lille hospitals, offers a new perspective on the links between power and assistance...|$|E
40|$|This {{study of}} Birmingham's local history around 1900 adopts a {{decision-making}} methodology, {{rooted in a}} modified and expanded version of Lukes' first dimension of power. Three significant and contrasting decision-making areas are investigated. It is argued that the council {{had little choice but}} to build the Elan valley waterworks if public health were to be safeguarded. Some of the ratepayers protested at the expense, but they failed to show that the scheme was unnecessary. Its enormous cost, however, caused growing disenchantment with Birmingham's "forward" civic policy. In contrast, the <b>municipalisation</b> of Birmingham's electricity supply industry was not forced upon the council by circumstances, but occurred at a time when the municipal trading movement was at its height, and when the potential profitability of electricity was becoming increasingly obvious. Throughout, the Corporation reserved to itself the power to municipalise by dominating the political agenda. In housing, despite a growing concern over slum conditions, the city council, after a few small-scale experiments, rejected proposals for municipal house building and relied instead upon a policy of "slum patching. " This development, in sharp contrast to the council's large scale building schemes after 1918, is explained via an investigation of the "mobilisation of bias" against more radical reform. Throughout, it is argued that Lukes' definitional categories can be modified so that the significant concepts of agenda setting and mobilisation of bias through decisions and non-decisions may be incorporated into the first dimension of power. Accordingly, contrary to many claims, they are susceptible to empirical analysis in the first dimension of power. Such an analysis sheds new light on both familiar and unfamiliar issues...|$|E
40|$|Liberalisation of railway {{market can}} be an {{important}} instrument for increasing the attractiveness of local rail services and consequently for making the railways more competitive with other means of transport, which could result in changing the modal share in the favour of railways. The differences in the railway liberalisation level {{as well as in the}} policies towards rail transport between Central and Eastern European countries are vast, hence the present situation and the future prospects of regional services are diverse. Whereas there is only one railway line in Slovakia which is not operated by the state railway company ZSSK, a few private local connections which complement a very dense network of ČD state railways are in service in the Czech Republic. Poland, by contrast, is a country where liberalisation of railway market is most advanced as several different companies are responsible for transport in the regions. However, the results of this large scale liberalisation are ambiguous as the positive effects (reopening of some lines) are balanced by isolation of the new regional government-owned systems from each other. In Austria, by contrast, the existence of several private and regional government-owned local railways which are an indispensable part of the regional transport networks has contributed to maintain an effective transport system. Although the effects of liberalisation on the local railway networks can often be ambiguous, several cases from the Czech Republic, Austria and Poland show that privatisation and <b>municipalisation</b> may have a positive effect on the railway service as it has enabled to maintain the service on many sections which were at risk of closure. However, the most important condition of the effective transport development seems to be an active cooperation between the railway operators and the local governments as an expression of appropriate transport policy...|$|E
40|$|Progressivism {{is a term}} {{describing}} {{an array}} of secular, transnational reform coalitions which emphasized government interventionism and reliance on expertise, when attempting to solve the largely urban problems presented by industrialisation. Progressivism emerged during the economic unrest {{of the last decade}} of the nineteenth century, reaching its peak by the end of the First World War and subsequently enjoying resurgence as a result of the sustained effects of the Great Depression during the mid- 1930 s. Following the armistice, popular attention across Australia began to turn away from a necessary focus on the demands of the war towards a determined consideration of the problems presented by the need for reconstruction and the continuing improvement of society. By 1919, thanks to highly innovative successive local governments, Launceston specifically had become remarkably well appointed for an Australian, regional city. However, like all urban population centres of the period, it still experienced the typical problems of the industrialised world: a sizable and permanent under-class that lived with entrenched poverty, long-term unemployment, insufficient educational opportunities and high rates of both preventable diseases and infant mortality. In Launceston during this period, Progressives emerged who were convinced that improving the urban environment was the key to resolving these issues. Many of their ‘scientific’ approaches to the new challenges of the industrial age had only just begun to filter into the collective consciousness of Launceston’s middle classes. Although diverse in nature, Launceston Progressives during the interwar period shared a common belief that by reshaping the lower orders in their own image, they alone could rescue them from ignorance, poverty and disease. By utilising a variety of approaches and under their guidance, resident Progressives hoped that Launceston would then truly become what C. E. W. Bean insisted was a noble and achievable goal: ‘a model among towns’. <b>Municipalisation</b> characterised the first stage of Progressivism in the city. During the interwar period, the Progressive charge was led by the professional elite of the city. Later, a coalition of businessmen sharing a decided ethic of civic engagement and altruism, helped to sustain and develop the local movement. The Great Depression at least created a suitable environment for an upsurge in Progressive resolve and activity, just as it did on the international stage. The thesis positions the Launceston experience of Progressivism within the context of the international historiography on the issue. Through the utilisation of local government records and contemporary newspapers, the course of Progressivism in Launceston is then found to mirror the evolution and fate of the wider, transnational movement. The Launceston experience of Progressivism then is confirmation of the pervasive global scope of several core convictions shared by Progressives. This thesis utilises a thematic approach, wherein each of the four key aspects of Progressivism as they manifested themselves in Launceston during the interwar period are separately analysed. Launceston Progressives began to turn to the new ‘scientific’ methodologies of both the traditional and the emerging professions for solutions. Town planning and sustained infrastructure developments were fundamental elements of the Progressive approach. The new bureaucratic orientation would ensure that the city could operate more efficiently. Increasing levels of social justice within the city also became an achievable goal. Specifically, Progressives concentrated on improving general access to professional services and education programs aimed at improving health outcomes. These coalitions were to be driven by a new, heightened sense of civic altruism. As a consequence, new Progressive coalitions began to form and actively seek the reorganisation of society at all levels. Launceston was, truly, a genuine example of Progressivism on the periphery...|$|E
