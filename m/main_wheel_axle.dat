50|$|Wheel speed {{transducers}} in each <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>axle</b> induce an AC frequency on the DC {{voltage input}} proportionate {{to the wheel}} speed as they are driven by the wheels. This frequency is compared to a normal deceleration curve and if it deviates it activates a small torque motor in the affected wheel control valve which shunts braking pressure to the return line {{by means of a}} spool valve. As the wheel rotation speed accelerates to normal tolerance limits, normal braking pressure is restored.|$|E
40|$|The article {{describes}} in detail {{an arrangement of}} trough-shaped wheel ramps and telescoping articulating control rods intended to allow a wheelchair-bound paraplegic to quickly ascend and descend single steps or curbs as high as 8 in. Data on testing of the system with trained and untrained able-bodied male and female subjects is reported; very limited testing with paraplegics suggests that their performance may almost equal that of the able-bodied. Advantages claimed include simplicity, light weight (8 !b) 'and low cost. Required modification of a standard wheelchair is limited to welding a simple bracket to the outer end of each extended <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>axle.</b> With ramps and control rods mounted ready for prompt use, chair width is increased {{by a total of}} 6 in. When the chair is used indoors or no curbs are expected, a paraplegic occupant, unaided, can dismount the ramps and rods and store them all in a canvas bag hanging from the seat back. In this configuration the chair is only 1 in wider than its originul unmodified width. Further testing with handicapped occu-pants is intended. Good arm, hand, and lower-back strength and movement, plus good coordination, are user requirements. FIGURE 1. Prototype curb-climbing aid for manual wheel-chairs, ascending a curb on its own ramps.

5000|$|An {{engineer}} named Tebaldi {{designed the}} Tebaldi-Zari, {{which was a}} single-seat wooden sesquiplane with heavily staggered wings and a [...] Isotta-Fraschini water-cooled V6 engine driving a two-bladed tractor propeller. Its fixed, tailskid landing gear was of very unusual configuration; the main gear was of very wide track and had oversized <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> with their <b>axle</b> incorporated into the lower wing.|$|R
50|$|Its fixed {{undercarriage}} had its <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> mounted without <b>axles,</b> with a {{track of}} 1600 mm. On each side a V-strut, with the hub at its vertex, was hinged at about 45° to the vertical {{from the lower}} fuselage longerons. A vertical bungee strut acted as a shock absorber, placing the wheel below the joint between centre and outer wing panels. Its tailskid was of the steel leaf spring type.|$|R
50|$|The Plein Air had a flat sided {{fuselage}} which tapered to the tail. This was conventional, with {{a straight}} edged fin and rudder with a rounded top. Its tailplane was strut braced to the fin. The tourer had a fixed tail <b>wheel</b> undercarriage with <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> on split <b>axles</b> mounted on the central fuselage underside; the legs were faired-in V-struts from the lower fuselage. The tail wheel, mounted on a telescopic leg, was also faired.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} was rectangular {{in cross-section}} and seated three in separate cockpits. The pilot sat just {{forward of the}} wing leading edge, there was a gunner's position (with emergency dual control) midway between the trailing edge and the tail and the front gunner/bomb-aimer's position was in the nose. [...] Both gunners' positions were provided with a [...]303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun mounted on a Scarff ring. The landing gear used two <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> on split <b>axles,</b> plus a tail-skid.|$|R
50|$|Structurally, the Hummel was {{a wooden}} aircraft. The wing were {{built around a}} wooden {{monospar}} with plywood covered leading edges and ailerons, with fabric covering elsewhere. The fuselage was a plywood covered wooden structure, as were the fixed tail surfaces, rudder and elevators being fabric covered. The horizontal tail surfaces were set noticeably aft of the rudder, rather like the more recent Piper PA-28. The enclosed cabin had dual controls, a single central control column being shared via horizontal extensions. There was a generous baggage space behind the seats. The fixed undercarriage had <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> on split <b>axles,</b> with low pressure tyres and brakes. There was a sprung tailskid.|$|R
50|$|The PC.500 was not {{a flying}} wing in that it a had a fuselage, though this was short, with its nose only {{a little ahead of}} the leading edge and its {{underside}} curving upwards to meet the wing just aft of mid-chord. It was ovoid in section and did not extend above the upper wing surface. The open, single-seat cockpit was immediately behind the leading edge and was provided with a faired, padded headrest. Its landing gear was fixed and conventional, with its <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> on split <b>axles</b> fixed to the fuselage bottom and with sloping legs to the fuselage sides. A small tailwheel was fitted to the rear end of the ventral fin.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRailway {{wheelsets}} {{consist of}} three <b>main</b> components; the <b>wheel,</b> <b>axle</b> and axle bearing. Faults can develop {{on any of}} the aforementioned components, but the most common are related to <b>wheel</b> and <b>axle</b> bearing damages. The continuous increase in train operating speeds means that failure of an axle bearing can lead to very serious derailments, potentially causing human casualties, severe disruption in the operation of the network, damage to the tracks, unnecessary costs, and loss of confidence in rail transport by the general public. The rail industry has focused on the improvement of maintenance and online condition monitoring of rolling stock to reduce the probability of failure as much as possible. This paper discusses the results of onboard acoustic emission measurements carried out on freight wagons with artificially damaged axle bearings in Long Marston, UK. Acoustic emission signal envelope analysis has been applied as a means of effective tool to detect and evaluate the damage in the bearings considered in this study. From the results obtained it is safe to conclude that acoustic emission signal envelope analysis has the capability of detecting and evaluating faulty axle bearings along with their characteristic defect frequencies in the real-world conditions...|$|R

25|$|The trams were {{equipped}} with two Hägglund-built H-bogies. They had an outer frame with the motor axles {{parallel with the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>axles.</b> Each axle had four rubber suspensions as its primary suspension. The carriage rested on the bogie on rubber plates. Later the bogies were supplemented with a shock absorber. The motors were connected to the <b>wheel</b> <b>axles</b> via a universal joint and a gear. The wheels were rubber suspended, but were later replaced with steel-suspended axle boxes which required less maintenance.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>wheel</b> and <b>axle</b> can {{be viewed}} as a version of the lever, with a drive force applied {{tangentially}} to the perimeter of the wheel and a load force applied to the axle, respectively, that are balanced around the hinge which is the fulcrum. The mechanical advantage of the <b>wheel</b> and <b>axle</b> is the ratio of the distances from the fulcrum to the applied loads, or what is the same thing the ratio of the diameter of the <b>wheel</b> and <b>axle.</b> [...] A major application is in wheeled vehicles, in which the <b>wheel</b> and <b>axle</b> are used to reduce friction of the moving vehicle with the ground.
