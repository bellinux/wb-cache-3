5|$|It's not {{my natural}} {{inclination}} to see <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> brand, I'm just {{a person who}} has been fortunate to explore other interests and passions outside of the game I love. I will always be associated with my sport but I am now working across other areas that will continue long after my career has finished.|$|E
5|$|I have then {{considered}} <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> particle {{broken off}} from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel that I was still {{a part of a}} mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2014 {{interview}} with Wired UK, Rowett reflected on his age, stating [...] "I see <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> hourglass. A {{large part of}} me is 112, a small part is my physical age and the last part is a 12-year-old boy." ...|$|R

25|$|In {{spite of}} the humiliation of demotion, he did not resign {{immediately}} from service {{and it has been}} suggested that this was because he needed his salary to support the publication of The Game Birds of India that he was working on. Hume retired from the civil service only in 1882. In 1883 he wrote an open letter to the graduates of Calcutta University, calling upon them to form their own national political movement. This led in 1885 to the first session of the Indian National Congress held in Bombay. In 1887 writing to the Public Commission of India he made what was then a statement unexpected from a civil servant — I look upon <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Native of India.|$|E
25|$|Subjectivity {{comes with}} {{consciousness}} of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> self. It encompasses {{the emotional and}} intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is {{to decide how to}} choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E

5000|$|During the 2008 presidential election, Maddow did not {{formally}} support any candidate. Concerning Barack Obama's candidacy, Maddow said, [...] "I have never and still don't think of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Obama supporter, either professionally or actually." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{believe that}} a {{painting}} must stand up on its own without explanation. I think of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> abstract action painter. I just happen to see landscape in the abstract events of paint. - James Lavadour ...|$|R
500|$|... "I'm {{one that}} likes to collaborate. I love feeding off the {{creative}} energy, {{and it only}} makes me better. I'm on a continual path both personally and professionally. All-around, it's my goal to better <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> person and an artist, and the show {{is one of those}} contributing factors and the guys are great friends at this point. It's fun collaborating with them at this point".|$|E
500|$|During 1968, Biden clerked for {{six months}} at a Wilmington law firm headed by {{prominent}} local Republican William Prickett and, as he later said, [...] "thought of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Republican". He disliked the conservative racial politics of incumbent Democratic Governor of Delaware Charles L. Terry and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968. The local Republicans tried to recruit him, but he resisted due to his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon, and registered as an Independent instead.|$|E
500|$|At school, Ripley enjoyed drama lessons, {{spurred on by}} the {{positive}} remarks she received from her drama teacher Susan Ford. She said of Ford, [...] "When I was 15, {{one of the few}} people who said, 'Well done', was my drama teacher, and she was really brilliant. She was a powerful woman. Those women change your life. You always remember them. There was something about her. She basically made me feel very good about <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 15-year-old girl." [...] Abandoning her childhood ambition to become a nurse, Ripley decided to go into acting.|$|E
6000|$|Helen grew grave also. [...] "I don't like {{to think}} of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> old actress. I want to have a fixed abiding-place when I am forty-five. Gray hairs should shine in the light of a fireside." ...|$|R
5000|$|He explained: Had I {{gotten any}} {{monetary}} success early on I wouldn’t {{have known what}} to do with it and I would’ve sabotaged <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist. I’m grateful that God really allowed me to fail the amount of times I failed so I could learn.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012 Drent {{quit his}} role on Shortland Street to pursue career {{opportunities}} in Australia. He commented, [...] "For me, broadening <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> actor, it was imperative that I move on, {{even if it}} meant losing a bit of security and taking a big risk." ...|$|R
500|$|Wintour herself, {{when asked}} about it, dismisses the notion that she has all the power {{attributed}} to her. [...] "I don't think of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> powerful person," [...] she told Forbes in 2011, when it named her 69th on its list of the world's hundred most powerful women. [...] "You know, what does it mean? It means you get a better seat in a restaurant or tickets to a screening or whatever it may be. But {{it is a wonderful}} opportunity {{to be able to help}} others, and for that I'm extremely grateful." ...|$|E
500|$|McEwan {{has been}} open about the autobiographical {{elements}} in the book, and has called it [...] "a muted and distorted autobiography" [...] and [...] "a muted, or transmuted, memoir of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> young writer." [...] There are, however, significant differences between author and character. Haley is both an academic and a writer of fiction, while McEwan has been a professional author for his entire career. The intelligence agency plot is also completely fictional; {{there was never a}} scheme such as the one described in the book run by MI5. As McEwan says himself, [...] "unfortunately a beautiful woman never came into my room and offered me a stipend." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{conception}} of the album, Aguilera told MTV News that [...] "it is a new beginning, a re-introduction of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> new artist in a way, because {{for the first time}} people are really seeing and getting to know who I really am". She also revealed, [...] "Coming off of the height of being a part of such a big pop-craze phenomenon, that imagery of that cookie-cutter sweetheart, without it being me, I just had to take it all down and get it away from me. And that is why I actually named the album Stripped, because it is about being emotionally stripped down and pretty bare to open my soul and heart". [...] "Walk Away" [...] was written by Aguilera, Scott Storch and Matt Morris, with production handled by Storch.|$|E
2500|$|Richards has {{frequently}} {{stated that he}} feels less like a creator than a conduit when writing songs: [...] "I don't have that god aspect about it.

500|$|In 1994, Anggun {{released}} Yang Hilang, a {{greatest hits}} album of her Indonesian hits. She later sold her record company to fund her move to Europe, {{and moved to}} London for about one year. In a 2006 interview with Trax magazine, Anggun admitted to experiencing [...] "culture shock" [...] and having some serious financial problems while trying to start her new life in Europe, saying [...] "I thought the money that I got by selling my record company was enough , but I began to lose money, little by little. I had to spend so much on taking cabs and eating! So I ended up taking buses everywhere and going to clubs to introduce <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> singer." [...] She also admitted that she [...] "had to convert from being a shy, introverted, 'real' Javanese woman to being an unabashed, fearless, 'fake' Javanese woman." ...|$|E
500|$|I've {{had this}} idea {{in my head}} for this show Tears of a Clown which is a {{combination}} of music and storytelling. Because {{at the end of the}} day I do think of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> story teller. But it's rough as f---, [...] so bear with me and give me all the support you can. It's from the heart. I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like I owe you a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer... If anyone thinks they came here to see a finished final show, there's the door. This is some brand spanking new shit. I don't know if you like it raw.|$|E
500|$|It {{is a very}} {{important}} film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was filmed was inspired by a journey I had made just three days after an earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 people had died. For the survivors, {{it was as if they}} were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five in the morning, so in a sense everybody could have been dead and it was almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just see <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. So this was a very big influence on me, and the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E
5000|$|He {{also played}} a role in the 1976 M*A*S*H episode [...] "The Korean Surgeon" [...] and a Saturday Night Live spoof of Apocalypse Now. However, though he had made <b>a</b> living <b>as</b> <b>an</b> actor for roughly a year, Hama {{ultimately}} discarded his acting career, explaining, [...] "I always basically saw <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist, not <b>as</b> anything else." ...|$|R
50|$|I don't {{classify}} <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> abstract artist. If {{the feeling}} is abstract, then yes, I am painting abstract -- the feeling and the subconscious emotions are slowing pushed out. Whenever I have an idea, I put it down on paper. I see rocks and tree formations. I {{get a lot of}} ideas from nature.|$|R
40|$|Professor Rawer’s {{professional}} ethics {{allowed him to}} create an excellent institute with co-workers forming a successful team with creative individuals.

500|$|Harries {{commented that}} he [...] "was {{interested}} {{in developing a}} quality action series out of the UK because it's something we don't do very often, but there's no reason why we shouldn't." [...] Richard Armitage called the series an [...] "ambitious project for television. But the advantage {{of that is that}} these three feature films are linked together so you get a really interesting character arc through all episodes. American television is being brave and doing that at the moment, and this is stepping into that area." [...] Former SAS soldier and the original novel's author, Chris Ryan, served as the series consultant and script advisor. Chris Ryan stated; [...] "When you produce a novel it's like a child and to see it put onto screen opens it up to a greater audience. I class <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> storyteller now, and to tell that story on paper is a great privilege, then to see it on screen is even better." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{prominent}} civilians summoned {{to appear before}} the military tribunal was a well-known novelist who wrote under the pen name of Nhat Linh. He was the VNQDĐ leader Nguyễn Tường Tam, who had been Ho Chi Minh's foreign affairs minister in 1946. Tam had abandoned his post rather than lead the delegation to the Fontainebleau Conference and make concessions to the French Union. In the 30months since the failed putsch, the police had not taken the conspiracy claims seriously enough to arrest Tam, but when Tam learned of the trial, he committed suicide by ingesting cyanide. He left a death note stating [...] "I also will kill <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> warning to those people who are trampling on all freedom", referring to Thích Quảng Đức, the monk who self-immolated in protest against Diệm's persecution of Buddhism. Tam's suicide was greeted with a mixed reception. Although some felt that it upheld the Vietnamese tradition of choosing death over humiliation, some VNQDĐ members considered Tam's actions to be romantic and sentimental.|$|E
500|$|On 8 August 2010, Robinson {{retired from}} {{international}} football with immediate effect, despite having been selected for a friendly against Hungary. He said about his retirement, [...] "Only now have I {{been able to}} make this decision as previously I haven't been in contention for selection, I don't see <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> number three or four keeper and find that role very frustrating," [...] while Allardyce backed his decision, stating, [...] "As my player, I support him because I see him week in, week out and know how well he has performed. It's a big decision he's made, but I understand it." [...] In his international career, Robinson had won 41 caps for England, 25 of which came in competitive international matches (either the qualification or final rounds of the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship). Despite Steve Kean stating that England should recall him in March 2012, Robinson stated that he had no interest in a return later that month. In February 2014, Robinson said that he would be open to an international return for the 2014 FIFA World Cup if England manager Roy Hodgson decided to recall him.|$|E
