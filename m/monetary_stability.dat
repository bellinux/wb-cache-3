25|$|The {{economic}} expansion was secured by <b>monetary</b> <b>stability,</b> moderate protectionism and government support of production. Foreign trade doubled between 1900 and 1910, wages rose, {{and the general}} standard of living went up. Nevertheless, the period was also marked by social dislocations. There was {{a sharp increase in}} the frequency and duration of industrial action, with major labour strikes in 1904, 1906 and 1908.|$|E
25|$|Stable {{prices and}} {{confidence}} in the currency are the two main criteria for <b>monetary</b> <b>stability.</b> Stable prices are maintained by seeking to ensure that price increases meet the Government's inflation target. The Bank aims to meet this target by adjusting the base interest rate, which is decided by the Monetary Policy Committee, and through its communications strategy, such as publishing yield curves.|$|E

The target and instrument autonomy of the Central Bank of Chile is strong by virtue of being enshrined in the constitution.

25|$|In {{order to}} secure <b>monetary</b> <b>stability</b> and control the inflation, Litas was {{introduced}} as the national currency of Lithuania, with the circulation starting on 25 June 1993. In 1994, it was pegged to the US Dollar {{at the rate of}} 4:1. The introduction of the currency did not soften the growing tensions between the Government, the Seimas and the Bank of Lithuania, which was criticized for its commercial activities and poor supervision of commercial banks. On 10 March 1993, the parliament accepted the resignation of bank's chairman, Vilius Baldišius, replacing him with Romualdas Visokavičius two weeks later. After the Commission for Investigating Financial Crimes, established by the Seimas, uncovered irregularities and illegal transactions in the bank, the Seimas expressed no-confidence in Visokavičius on 19 October 1993, forcing him out and replacing him with Kazimieras Ratkevičius.|$|E

2500|$|Eventually, the United States {{needed to}} devalue the dollar. During the early 1960s American {{officials}} largely prevented {{the conversion of}} dollars to gold {{with a series of}} [...] "gentlemanly" [...] agreements and other policies – which included the London Gold Pool - but these actions were not sustainable; the danger of a run on U.S. gold reserves was too high. [...] With Nixon's election in 1968, American officials became increasingly concerned until Nixon finally issued Executive Order 11615 in August 1971, ending the direct convertibility of dollars to gold. He said, [...] "We must protect the position of the American dollar as pillar of <b>monetary</b> <b>stability</b> around the world… I am determined that the American dollar must never again be hostage {{in the hands of the}} international speculators." [...] This became known as the Nixon Shock and marked the dollar's transition from the gold standard to a fiat currency.|$|E

In June 1993, the first month after Lamont had left the Treasury, Britain recorded its lowest monthly rate of inflation since February 1964. [...] According to Alan Budd, the Treasury's Chief Economic Adviser during the period, the important step of central bank independence could only have been successful once <b>monetary</b> <b>stability</b> had been achieved; [...] "In 1997 the Bank of England was not asked to succeed where politicians had failed; it was asked to maintain the rate of inflation, namely 2.5%, that it inherited." [...] In Budd's view, the essential elements of the new framework and its success in achieving low and stable inflation were the establishment of an inflation target and the institution of monthly meetings with the governor of the Bank of England to discuss interest rates. The new framework, according to Budd, [...] "worked extraordinarily well." [...] "Credit must be given to those, principally Norman Lamont, who designed and implemented it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The aim {{of forming}} a CARICOM {{monetary}} union is not new. As {{a precursor to}} this idea the various CARICOM countries established a compensation procedure to favour {{the use of the}} member states currencies. The procedure was aimed at ensuring <b>monetary</b> <b>stability</b> and promoting trade development. This monetary compensation scheme was at first bilateral, but this system was limited and unwieldy because each member state had to have a separate account for each of its CARICOM trade partners and the accounts had to be individually balanced {{at the end of each}} credit period. The system became multilateral in 1977 and was called the CARICOM Multilateral Clearing Facility (CMCF). The CMCF was supposed to favour the use of internal CARICOM currencies for transaction settlement and to promote banking cooperation and monetary cooperation between member states. Each country was allowed a fixed credit line and initially the CMCF was successful enough that both the total credit line and the credit period were extended by 1982. However, the CMCF failed shortly thereafter in the early 1980s due to Guyana's inability to settle its debts and Barbados being unable to grant new payment terms ...|$|E
2500|$|..... he {{proximate}} {{cause of the}} world depression was a structurally flawed and poorly managed international gold standard. ... For a variety of reasons, including a desire of the Federal Reserve to curb the US stock market boom, monetary policy in several major countries turned contractionary in the late 1920s—a contraction that was transmitted worldwide by the gold standard. What was initially a mild deflationary process began to snowball when the banking and currency crises of 1931 instigated an international [...] "scramble for gold". Sterilization of gold inflows by surplus countries , substitution of gold for foreign exchange reserves, and runs on commercial banks all led to increases in the gold backing of money, and consequently to sharp unintended declines in national money supplies. Monetary contractions in turn were strongly associated with falling prices, output and employment. Effective international cooperation could in principle have permitted a worldwide monetary expansion despite gold standard constraints, but disputes over World War I reparations and war debts, and the insularity and inexperience of the Federal Reserve, among other factors, prevented this outcome. As a result, individual countries were able to escape the deflationary vortex only by unilaterally abandoning the gold standard and re-establishing domestic <b>monetary</b> <b>stability,</b> a process that dragged on in a halting and uncoordinated manner until France and the other Gold Bloc countries finally left gold in 1936. —Great Depression, B.
