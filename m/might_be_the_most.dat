25|$|During reverse {{electron}} transfer, complex I <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important site of superoxide production within mitochondria, {{with up to}} 5% {{of electrons}} being diverted to superoxide formation. Reverse electron transfer, {{the process by which}} electrons from the reduced ubiquinol pool (supplied by succinate dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, or dihydro-oorotate dehydrogenase in mammalian mitochondria) pass through complex I to reduce NAD+ to NADH, driven by the inner mitochondrial membrane potential electric potential. Although it is not precisely known under what pathological conditions reverse-electron transfer would occur in vivo, in vitro experiments indicate that it can be a very potent source of superoxide when succinate concentrations are high and oxaloacetate or malate concentrations are low.|$|E

25|$|Based on DNA {{sequences}} {{from the}} nuclear ribosomal {{internal and external}} transcribed spacers, Danish botanist Nina Rønsted and colleagues rejected previous subdivisions of the Malvanthera. Instead, they divided section Malvanthera into three subsections—Malvantherae, Platypodeae and Hesperidiiformes. In this system, the Moreton Bay fig is in the new subsection Malvantherae, along with F. pleurocarpa. The Malvantherae {{appear to be an}} early offshoot and basal to the group. Both forms are native to Australia, with form columnaris of macrophylla having colonised Lord Howe Island. Ronsted and colleagues suggest this last form <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> ancient of the three taxa. The section Malvanthera itself is thought to have evolved 41 million years ago and radiated from 35 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Foley first {{played with}} The Replacements {{publicly}} for First Avenue's twentieth anniversary.

Starting in January 1991, The Replacements toured Europe for Warner Bros.' Sire Records for All Shook Down as the opening act for Elvis Costello. But their review in New York was poor and they broke up, perhaps because Westerberg was {{in pursuit of a}} solo career, or they just quit. What is known is that Paul Westerberg, Mars, and Bob and Tommy Stinson who formed The Replacements played rock music that was perhaps the most legendary and <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> influential so far to emerge from Minnesota.

25|$|The impalement arts {{have evolved}} {{as the product}} of a history of {{performance}} dating back to at least the 19th century. That heritage, and especially the collective achievements of notable performers, helps to define the subject. As with other performance arts, judgements about who <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> notable are highly subjective and clouded by the hyperbole of publicity. For similar reasons it is also sometimes difficult to resolve debates about who originated particular stunts. Nevertheless, some names recur frequently in historical records and current news. Some are recognised for pioneering achievements, some for bringing the arts to widespread audiences and some as distinctive characters who, although less famous, have had significant influence on their peers. Because this is not a league table of merit and because overlaps make a chronological presentation awkward, they are presented here in alphabetic order under the two main disciplines.|$|E
