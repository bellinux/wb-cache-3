5|$|The river's {{flora and}} fauna have been both {{deliberately}} and accidentally impacted since settlement. In the 19th century, native forests were cleared, gravel removed for construction and many foreign species introduced. With construction of the linear parks, many species native to the river have been replanted, and introduced species have been controlled as weeds. Since European settlement the river has been a frequently touted tourist attraction. During {{the early years of}} settlement, the river acted as both the city's primary water source and <b>main</b> <b>sewer,</b> leading to outbreaks of typhus and cholera.New site: http://www.amlrnrm.sa.gov.au Active on 9 September 2009.|$|E

50|$|Waste {{water would}} end up {{primarily}} in the <b>main</b> <b>sewers,</b> which led into the Cloaca Maxima and finally the river Tiber. The continuous flow of water ensured that the sewers were kept clear and free of obstructions, so contributing to the hygiene of the city.|$|R
500|$|The {{high-level}} sewer—the most northern of the works—ran from Hampstead Heath to Stoke Newington {{and across}} Victoria Park, where it {{joined with the}} eastern end of the mid-level sewer. The mid-level sewer began in the west at Bayswater and ran along Oxford Street, through Clerkenwell and Bethnal Green, before the connection. This combined <b>main</b> <b>sewer</b> ran to the Abbey Mills Pumping Station in Stratford, where it was joined by {{the eastern end of}} the low-level sewer. The pumps at Abbey Mills lifted the effluent from the low-level sewer [...] into the <b>main</b> <b>sewer.</b> This <b>main</b> <b>sewer</b> ran —along what is now known as the Greenway—to the outfall at Beckton.|$|E
500|$|What often {{finished}} {{them off}} was {{being forced to}} lie in the strong room, a windowless shed near the <b>main</b> <b>sewer,</b> next to piles of night soil and cadavers awaiting burial. Dickens described it as [...] "dreaded by even the most dauntless highwaymen and bearable only to toads and rats". One apparently diabetic army officer {{who died in the}} strong room—he had been ejected from the common side because inmates had complained about the smell of his urine—had his face eaten by rats within hours of his death, according to a witness.|$|E
500|$|By June 1856 Bazalgette {{completed}} his definitive plans, which provided for small, local sewers about [...] in diameter to feed {{into a series}} of larger sewers until they drained into main outflow pipes [...] high. A Northern and Southern Outfall Sewer were planned to manage the waste for each side of the river. London was mapped into high-, middle- and low-level areas, with a <b>main</b> <b>sewer</b> servicing each; a series of pumping stations was planned to remove the waste towards the east of the city. Bazalgette's plan was based on that of Foster, but was larger in scale, and allowed for more of a rise in population than Foster's– from 3 to 4.5million. Bazalgette submitted his plans to Sir Benjamin Hall, the First Commissioner of Works. Hall had reservations about the outfalls—the discharge points of waste outlets into other bodies of water—from the sewers, which he said were still within the bounds of the capital, and were therefore unacceptable. During the ongoing discussions Bazalgette refined and modified his plans, in line with Hall's demands. In December 1856 Hall submitted the plans to a group of three consultant engineers, Captain Douglas Strutt Galton of the Royal Engineers, James Simpson, an engineer with two water companies, and Thomas Blackwood, the chief engineer on the Kennet and Avon Canal. The trio reported back to Hall in July 1857 with proposed changes to the positions of the outfall, which he passed on to the MBW in October. The new proposed discharge points were to be open sewers, running [...] beyond the positions proposed by the board; the cost of their plans was to be over £5.4million, considerably more than the maximum estimate of Bazalgette's plan, which was £2.4million. In February 1858 a general election saw the fall of Lord Palmerston's Whig government, which was replaced by Lord Derby's second Conservative ministry; Lord John Manners replaced Hall, and Benjamin Disraeli was appointed Leader of the House of Commons and Chancellor of the Exchequer.|$|E
5000|$|Bazalgette's {{solution}} (similar to {{a proposal}} made by painter John Martin 25 years earlier) was {{to construct a}} network of 82 mi of enclosed underground brick <b>main</b> <b>sewers</b> to intercept sewage outflows, and 1100 mi of street sewers, to intercept the raw sewage which up until then flowed freely through the streets and thoroughfares of London.|$|R

2500|$|After the {{establishment}} of the B rail yard, Ivy City attracted a large number of rail yard workers as residents. [...] This allowed the neighborhood to thrive. Nonetheless, Ivy City received few services from the city. In the 1920s, there was a single fire alarm callbox in the entire neighborhood, and the city had installed only a second <b>main</b> <b>sewer</b> line. But residents were dismayed when the city built a trash incinerator in 1928 at the junction of Mt. Olivet Road and West Virginia Avenue NE. As of 1931, only a single road (West Virginia Avenue NE) led gave access to Ivy City.|$|E

50|$|A sewer {{dosing unit}} (SDU) is a {{plumbing}} device to allow effective sewage disposal with low liquid-flow rates. With a global emphasis on water saving, many new buildings and renovations {{are seeing the}} installation of water saving fixtures such as low flow shower heads and low flush toilets. With the decrease in wastewater flows problems are arising from waste solids not being carried completely to the <b>main</b> <b>sewers,</b> often causing blockages.|$|R
50|$|The intercepting sewers, {{constructed}} between 1859 and 1865, {{were fed}} by 450 miles (720 km) of <b>main</b> <b>sewers</b> that, in turn, conveyed {{the contents of}} some 13,000 miles (21,000 km) of smaller local sewers. Construction of the interceptor system required 318 million bricks, 2.7 million cubic metres of excavated earth and 670,000 cubic metres of concrete. The innovative use of Portland cement strengthened the tunnels, which were in good order 150 years later.|$|R

50|$|As Britain was {{the first}} country to industrialize, {{it was also the}} first to {{experience}} the disastrous consequences of major urbanisation and {{was the first}} to construct a sewerage system {{as we know it today}} to mitigate the resultant unsanitary conditions. Joseph Bazalgette designed an extensive underground sewerage system that diverted waste to the Thames Estuary, downstream of the main centre of population. Six <b>main</b> interceptor <b>sewers,</b> totalling almost 135 miles (217 km) in length, were constructed. The intercepting sewers, constructed between 1859 and 1865, were fed by 450 miles (720 km) of <b>main</b> <b>sewers</b> that, in turn, conveyed the contents of some 13,000 miles (21,000 km) of smaller local sewers. With only minor modifications, Bazalgette's engineering achievement remains the basis for sewerage design up into the present day.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the massive infrastructure of the London sewerage system with five <b>main</b> <b>sewers</b> incorporated many existing culverts, storm sewers, or sluices. This included the culvertized Walbrook, which by 1860 had been linked into a network of 82 miles worth of new sewerage lines, channeled to the Northern Low Level Sewer at a point near the Bank of England. Many small leaks stream into the rounded sewer {{for much of the}} year when the water table is sufficient.|$|R

500|$|The {{southern}} system, {{across the}} less populated suburbs of London, was the smaller and easier {{part of the}} system to build. Three <b>main</b> <b>sewers</b> ran from Putney, Wandsworth and Norwood until they linked together in Deptford. At that point a pumping station lifted the effluent [...] into the <b>main</b> outflow <b>sewer,</b> which ran to the Crossness Pumping Station on the Erith Marshes, where it was discharged into the Thames at high tide. The newly built station at Crossness was designed by Bazalgette and a consultant engineer, Charles Henry Driver, a proponent of the use of cast iron as a building material. The building was in a Romanesque style and the interior contains architectural cast ironwork which English Heritage describe as important. The power for pumping the large amount of sewage was provided by four massive beam engines, named Victoria, Prince Consort, Albert Edward and Alexandra, which were manufactured by James Watt and Co.|$|R
