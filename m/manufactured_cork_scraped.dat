40|$|The cork {{sector is}} a {{relevant}} case study given the economic {{importance of this}} industry for some regions (value added, employment and rural development). This industry is also important because of its contribution to environmental sustainability as it uses a natural renewable raw material. Portugal and Spain {{are the most important}} producers of cork and exporters of <b>manufactured</b> <b>cork</b> products (stoppers and agglomerates). The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to study the economic integration and the historical changes of cork business localization in the Iberian Peninsula. We start by studying the historical roots, motivations and economic consequences of the delocalization of Catalonian firms to Portugal during the first quarter of the 20 th century. Then a comparison is made with the recent process of delocalization of an anchor firm of Aveiro industrial district (Corticeira Amorim) to Spain. The theoretical framework of this study is the industry and cluster life cycles as well as the recent insights from the evolutionary economic geography...|$|R
40|$|During {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the Spanish cork {{industry}} had lost its hegemonic position to Portugal, in the world market of <b>manufactured</b> <b>cork.</b> In this work we intend to demonstrate that one of the most important explanations of the consolidation of this country's leadership in the cork business lies in the formation and development of the industrial cork district of Aveiro (Santa Maria da Feira) in the north of Portugal. It was there where the growth of the Portuguese stopper industry took place and with this, the decisive orientation of this nation towards the <b>manufacture</b> of natural <b>cork,</b> substituting the traditional Portuguese trade in cork planks. We argue that the legislation that established the control of the industrial investment in Portugal, the so-called Industrial Conditioning {Condicionamento Industrial) did not restrict the opening of small cottage industries in the north, that fact being a determining reinforcement of the competitiveness of Aveiro in the world stopper trade. Another measure of major importance was the wage regulation covering this industry, being responsible for the wage differential favourable to the north comparing with the south and the centre of the country. Finally, we highlight the role of a big company (Amorim&Irmaos) in the formation and development of this industrial district, which became a leader firm in this sector at a world-wide level...|$|R

With 62, he {{traveled}} to French territory with his wife, his daughter (Concepción Pijoan), his brother Francis and his sister in law Maria Duran, his nieces and the wife of his brother Nicholas. All their property in Sant Feliu de Guixols were confiscated by the fascist authorities.He lived {{for a time in}} Le Boulou (Roussillon) and later settled in Ceret (Vallespir), where he sought his livelihood dedicated to what he did best: the cork industry. In 1940, he was arrested by the Vichy French authorities and confined in Le Mans, where he could escape and return to Céret.With the execution of Lluis Companys, 15 October 1940, he refused to travel to America and became, automatically, President of the Generalitat of Catalonia according to the Interior Statute of Catalonia. He was the only modern president who would not set foot, as such, the Palace of the Generalitat. Then, he moved to Cogolin, where he resumed the <b>manufacture</b> of <b>cork</b> stoppers, an activity that provided the resources needed to survive.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of foreign outsourcing, focusing on CEE countries and especially on Turkey, on the level of employment for Spain. The rising economic integration has increased not only trade in final goods but also the flows of intermediate goods, as a result of the fragmentation of production by multinational firms and/or the search for new and cheaper providers. While some see this phenomenon as a threat to domestic employment, it also represents a chance to reduce costs, increase flexibility and open new markets, all of which can raise sales and employment. We study empirically this impact for Spain, a country that joined the EEC in 1986, becoming a low-cost location for many firms, and after twenty-years of development it is now experiencing a strong increase of outsourcing to Central and Eastern European countries with a specific analysis of the case of Turkey. The trade relationship between Turkey and Spain has been reinforced significantly in the last years and has concentrated in a few sectors, with important relative increase in imports from particular sectors as Agriculture, Textile, Leather goods, Manufacture of footwear, <b>Manufacture</b> of <b>cork</b> and wood, <b>Manufacture</b> of articles of paper and cardboard, Manufacture of rubber and plastic products...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} it is {{analyzed}} the evolution {{and composition of}} the foreign Spanish trade of cork products {{during the second half}} of the XIXth century and the XXth century. For it there has been in use the Estadística del Comercio Exterior de España, elaborated from 1849 up to the current importance. The above mentioned analysis sets up important changes in the characteristics that the cork business has had in Spain during the considered period, at least from a commercial point of view, emphasizing the major relevancy acquired by the import trade in the last quarter of the XXth century and the return to the stopper, which has frustrated the diversification process of the cork industry and trade, initiated in the first years of last century. For countries, Portugal has turned, from the civil war, into the first world power to the detriment of Spain. Our country could not have recovered the commercial leadership, that had {{during the second half of}} the XIXth century and the first third of the XXth, on the principal cork markets and, at present, it has small presence, in relative terms, on the markets of the new wine countries, great buyers of cork stoppers.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to analyze the measures implemented during the Franco dictatorship over the period 1939 ㈀ 1959 to revive the exports of cork products, which had fallen sharply {{since the beginning of}} the crisis of 1929. The first measure, implemented in 1939 and 1940, was granting tax reliefs to exporters of several cork products; its impact on commercial traffic of cork was very low. The second measure was the establishment, between 1946 and 1950, of a subsidies system for cork exports, which allowed the recovery of the Spanish cork exports. Yet, these were classified as dumping by the United States and created a trade conflict, which forced its repeal. Immediately after this repeal, cork products were incorporated into the multiple exchange rates mechanism in force in Spain since 1948, a system of hidden subsidies that allowed an improvement in cork exports during the 1950 's. The work also examines whether the objective of protecting domestic industry, through the promotion of <b>cork</b> <b>manufactures</b> exports, was limited by the need of obtaining foreign exchange from exports. The incentives that the dictatorship applied for the export of raw cork that was in turn needed by the industry to work with, seems to point to such limit.
