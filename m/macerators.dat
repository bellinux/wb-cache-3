5000|$|In 2014, ducks {{accounted}} for 95% of foie gras production.

40|$|Particle size may {{significantly}} affect {{the speed and}} stability of anaerobic digestion, and matching the choice of particle size reduction equipment to digester type can thus determine {{the success or failure}} of the process. In the current research the organic fraction of municipal solid waste was processed using a combination of a shear shredder, rotary cutter and wet <b>macerator</b> to produce streams with different particle size distributions. The pre-processed waste was used in trials in semi-continuous ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ digesters at organic loading rate (OLR) up to 6 kg volatile solids (VS) m? 3 day? 1. The results indicated that while difference in the particle size distribution did not change the specific biogas yield, the digester performance was affected. In the ‘dry’ digesters the finer particle size led to acidification and ultimately to process failure at the highest OLR. In ‘wet’ digestion a fine particle size led to severe foaming and the process could not be operated above 5 kg VS m? 3 day? 1. Although the trial was not designed as a direct comparison between ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ digestion, the specific biogas yield of the ‘dry’ digesters was 90 % of that produced by ‘wet’ digesters fed on the same waste at the same OLR. <br/...|$|R
30|$|The spawns after {{acclimatization}} {{were divided}} into four major groups for exposure to different concentrations of β–glucan, such as Group A (0 mg l- 1, control), Group B (5 mg l- 1), Group C (10 mg l- 1) and Group D (15 mg l- 1). Fifty spawns were kept {{in each of the}} duplicate beaker (1 L) for each treatment group. After bath exposure with β –glucan suspension for 3 h, four spawns were collected from each tank after a time interval of 3 h for evaluating changes in lysozyme activity, acid phosphate (AcP) activity, total protein content, bactericidal activity and superoxide anion assay. As it was difficult to draw blood from spawn with indistinctly developed internal organs, the entire body of four spawns taken at a time was aseptically placed in a <b>macerator</b> containing Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and anticoagulant, heparin. The macerated sample was layered on to preform continuous gradients of 51 % percoll (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) in 8.5 g l- 1 NaCl and centrifuged at 800 g for 20 min at 4 °C. The white cell band formed at the interface of the cell suspension and percoll layer was harvested with a Pasteur pipette, diluted ten folds with HBSS and recentrifuged at 800 g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove residual percoll. The resulting pellet was again washed twice and centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant white band cell suspension was used for assaying lysozyme, acid phosphatase, bactericidal, superoxide anion activities and total protein content. After the third wash, the concentration and viability of leucocytes cell suspensions were determined in 0.2 % trypan blue. The total protein content of the cell lysate was analysed using protein kit (Bangalore Genei Protein Kit, Bradford macro method) and bovine serum albumin as standard as per the manufacturers instructions.|$|R
40|$|Growth habit, occurrence, and use. Common seabuckthorn—Hippophae rhamnoides L. —is {{native to}} northwestern Europe through central Asia to the Altai Mountains, western and {{northern}} China, {{and the northern}} Himalayas. Of the 2 species in the genus, only common seabuckthorn is widely cultivated (Rehder 1940). A very hardy deciduous shrub or a small tree, common seabuck-thorn is used primarily for ornamental purposes. In Europe and Asia, {{it is used to}} form hedges and, because of its nitro-gen-fixing symbionts, serves to enrich and protect soils (Bogdon and Untaru 1967; Kao 1964; Stewart and Pearson 1967). A tendency to form thickets by root suckering limits its use in shelterbelts. In Asia, the plant has a variety of medicinal uses (Ma 1989). The berries, which are a rich source of vitamins (Stocker 1948; Valicek 1978; Zhmyrko and others 1978), have been used in making a cordial and jam in Siberia (Hansen 1931). The plant stems bear many sharp, stout thorns and provide protection, cover, and food for various birds and small rodents (Hansen 1931; Pearson and Rogers 1962). Flowering and fruiting. The species is dioecious; its very small, yellowish, pistillate flowers appear in March or April before the leaves (Pearson and Rogers 1962; Slabaugh 1974). Orange-yellow, drupelike acidic fruits {{about the size of a}} pea (figure 1) (Rehder 1940) ripen in September or October (Hoag 1965; Hottes 1952) and frequently persist on the shrubs until the following March. Each fruit contains a bony, ovoid seed (figures 1 and 2). Seedcrops are borne annually. Collection, extraction, and storage. Common seabuckthorn fruits are soft and cling tenaciously to the brit-tle twigs (Demenko and others 1983). Fruits may be picked from the bushes at any time between late fall and early spring. However, germination may vary with the time that seeds were extracted from the ripe fruits (Eliseev and Mishulina 1972). Seeds may be extracted by running the wet fruits through a <b>macerator</b> and floating off the pulp. Prompt cleaning and drying is advantageous because germi-nation rate is very low for seeds left too long in the fruits (Eliseev and Mishulina 1977; Rohmeder 1942). From 45 k...|$|R
40|$|HGrowth habit, occurrence, and uses. The genus Heteromeles {{has only}} a single species—H. arbutifolia (Lindl.) M. Roemer, also known as H. salicifolia (K. Presl.) Abrams (Phipps 1992). It {{is closely related to}} the large trop-ical genus Photinia Lindl., to which it has {{sometimes}} been referred. Christmasberry, also known as toyon, California-holly, and hollywood, is a long-lived shrub or small tree, 2 to 10 m in height, that sprouts freely after fire from a sub-terranean burl. It has shiny, leathery, evergreen leaves that are sharply toothed along the margins. A common con-stituent of chaparral vegetation throughout California and Baja California, it is usually found on less harsh, more mesic microsites. Christmasberry is useful for erosion con-trol, is a source of honey, and has leaves and fruits that pro-vide food for wildlife. It has also been widely planted in California as an ornamental for park, freeway, and home landscape use (Magill 1974). The attractive foliage and fruits are cut and used for their decorative value. Flowering and fruiting. Unlike many chaparral shrubs, Christmasberry is summer-flowering (Magill 1974). The numerous, small flowers are borne in flat-topped or convex terminal inflorescences. The flowers are perigynous and have 5 separate petals, 10 stamens, and a 2 - to 3 -carpel-late ovary. The fruits are bright red to orange, 2 - or 3 -seeded juicy pomes that are 6 to 10 mm in diameter. They ripen from October through January and are dispersed by birds. Good crops are reported to occur yearly (Keeley 1992). Seed collection, cleaning, and storage. Christmasberry fruits may be clipped or stripped from the branches once they have attained a bright red or orange color (Magill 1974). They should be soaked in water and allowed to ferment slightly. (However, too-long a soaking period can damage the seeds, which have soft, pliable seed-coats.) The seeds (figure 1 and 2) may then be separated from the pulp by passage through a <b>macerator,</b> followed by flotation to remove the pulp. Small lots can be hand-rubbed through a large-holed screen. The seeds may then be allowed to dry. Once dry, any flat, unfilled seeds can be removed by screening. Christmasberry seed weight is apparently highly vari-able. Magill (1974) reported a mean seed weight of 19 mg and count of 52, 630 seeds/kg (23, 900 /lb), whereas Keeley (1991) reported a seed weight of 5. 5 mg and count o...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports the}} use of a {{mechanical}} macerating device to characterise the patterns of, and resistance to, fragmentation of leaf and stem fractions of spear grass (Heteropogon contortus) and sabi grass (Urochloa mosambicensis). The four substrates, cut to a length of 1. 5 - 2 cm, were exposed to microbial fermentation in the rumen of cattle for periods of between 0 and 96 h. A novel macerating device was used to grind substrates in a water medium for a series of predetermined number of rotor revolutions of the <b>macerator.</b> The extent of fragmentation was then measured by wet sieving. Statistical modelling, using phase-type distributions, was used to describe the numbers of revolutions required to fragment the substrates into three compartments defined by particles retained on screens of 1180, 600, and 50 μm pore size. The study identified multi-exponential patterns of fragmentation of tropical grass fractions. Resistance to fragmentation of large particles, estimated by the number of rotor revolutions required for 0. 75 of particles to be removed from that pool, was high for both stem fractions, and was not markedly affected by time of microbial fermentation. Spear grass leaf had high resistance to fragmentation until exposed to microbial fermentation for 24 h, after which it attained the low resistance to fragmentation typical of sabi grass leaf at all microbial fermentation times. Fragmentability of large particles, defined as the proportion of small particles originating from the large particle pool which did not pass through the medium particle pool, was always high for leaf (> 0. 66), but for stem fractions it was quite variable. Sabi grass stem achieved maximum fragmentability values typical of leaf (0. 70), but for spear grass stem fragmentability was lower at 0. 52. The potential digestibility of particle fractions following various degrees of maceration, was assessed after in vitro fermentation for 120 h. Extensive maceration of samples not exposed to rumen fermentation increased sample digestibility of the leaf fractions by 3 to 7 %, and of stem of spear grass and sabi grass by 380 and 120 % respectively. For sabi grass stem, the relative increase in potential digestibility after maceration progressively declined in samples after rumen fermentation; no such decline was seen for spear grass stem. The implications of the results to nutritive value for the ruminant eating forage diets are discussed. It is suggested that the phase-type statistical modelling techniques used are of value in the study of particle movements and fragmentation in the reticulorumen...|$|R
