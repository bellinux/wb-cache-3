40|$|This {{paper is}} the first step in the {{integration}} of the (search-theoretic) microfoundation of monetary theory into the fruitful analysis by Lucas (1990). I construct two search models, in which fiat money coexists in equilibrium with default-free nominal bonds issued by the government, and then use the models to analyze the effects of money growth and open market operations. In the first model, <b>matured</b> <b>bonds</b> circulate in the goods market as perfect substitutes for money and there are a continuum of stationary equilibria of this sort. In the second model, <b>matured</b> <b>bonds</b> do not circulate in the goods market and there is a unique stationary equilibrium. In both models, newly issued bonds are sold at a discount for money and thus they bear positive interest. The effects of monetary policies differ in these two economies.

We extend Leland’s structural credit risk model with two realistic features: illiquid secondary bond markets and a mix of short-term and long-term bonds in a …rm’s debt structure. As deteriorating market liquidity pushes down bond prices, it ampli…es the con‡ict of interest between the debt and equity holders because, to avoid bankruptcy, the equity holders have to absorb all of the short-fall from rolling over <b>maturing</b> <b>bonds</b> at the reduced market values. As a result, the equity holders choose to default at a higher fundamental threshold {{even if there is}} no friction for …rms to raise more equity.

40|$|We study {{a simple}} model of {{liquidity}} risk management {{in which a}} firm is subject to rollover risk. When a firm is unable to rollover its <b>maturing</b> <b>bonds</b> by issuing new bonds, it may have to seek more expensive sources of financing or even liquidate its assets, possibly at fire-sale prices. One way to reduce this risk is to hold excess cash reserves, which can be expensive in practice (Bengt Holmström and Jean Tirole 2000; 2001). In this paper, we focus on an alternative way of managing liquidity risk, through the optimal (dynamic) choice of the maturity structure of debt. Our analysis highlights one advantage of short-term financing. The firm, while in good financial health, can readjust its maturity structure more quickly in response to changes in its asset value. Ideally, the firm would secure long-term financing just prior to when its financial health may worsen. Through this strategy, the firm can secure financing for the longest continuous period possible without rollover failure, avoiding inefficient restructuring costs. Put differently, {{the objective of the}} firm with long-term assets is to maximize the effective maturity of its liabilities across several refinancing cycles, rather than to maximize the maturity of the current bonds outstanding...|$|R

40|$|First version March 29, 2015; This version March 15, 2016 During {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis (GFC), Japan and the U. S. differed {{in at least two}} important ways: (1) while markets were stable in Japan then, the bubbles in the U. S. housing and financial markets burst and (2) while Japanese banks suffered few losses, huge losses badly weakened U. S. banks. In addition, and unlike the U. S., Japan requires firms' balance sheets to show, not only their total debt, but also the components of their debt: bonds, loans, and other debt. We used data for listed, non-financial, Japanese firms' bonds, bank loans, and other debt to investigate whether the 2008 "Lehman shock" in the U. S. disrupted Japanese bond markets. The Japanese data al-lowed us to estimate how much the Lehman shock affected Japanese firms' bonds outstanding and issued and to estimate how much, in turn, the Lehman shock resulted in firms' getting more loans from Japanese banks. The estimates revealed important cross-currents during the crisis. Our estimates implied that, while the crisis reduced bond issuance, it was accompanied by enough more bank loans to raise total debt. During the crisis, both bonds outstanding and bond issuance responded less to prior bond shortfalls and responded less to their <b>maturing</b> <b>bonds.</b> Second, while it greatly reduced bonds issued and outstanding at smaller, listed firms, the crisis boosted them at the very largest firms. In contrast, bank loans then rose more at smaller firms. Third, bank loans rose more, and bonds outstanding fell more, at firms with greater exposure to foreign sales. Fourth, the crisis led firms, and especially larger firms, to hold more cash and fewer securities and to reduce costs. Fifth, capital expenditures generally declined during the crisis, but declined significantly less at larger firms...|$|R
40|$|The {{policy of}} Euro-area officialdom {{in the period}} 2010 - 2011 was to avoid, at all costs, a default and {{restructuring}} of the sovereign debt {{of a member of}} the monetary union. This policy was motivated principally, but not exclusively, by a fear that the international capital markets, if forcibly reminded of the precarious position of overindebted, growth-challenged members of a monetary union, might recoil generally from lending to European sovereigns. In short, they feared contagion. The only alternative to permitting a debt restructuring, of course, was an official sector bailout. The afflicted countries [...] Greece (until 2012), Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus [...] received loans from official sector sources sufficient to allow them to repay in full their <b>maturing</b> <b>bond</b> indebtedness. Whenever and wherever the crisis erupted, contagion was thus held in check by the blunt technique of smothering the outbreak [...] in money. The proponents of this policy argued at the time, and argue now, that many European sovereigns in 2010 were far too fragile to endure a bout of market contagion. They argued that an acute crisis needed to be averted in order to buy time for the implementation of a gradual but more durable remedy. Had the intervening eight years been used to reduce the debt vulnerabilities of the peripheral (and even some core) states, this argument would now be powerful, indeed invincible. Unfortunately, the opposite happened. Average state indebtedness in Europe today is about one-third larger than it was in 2008. Both the member states and the market saw the reprieve as spreading a reliable official sector safety net under their exposure. So they kept on borrowing and lending. Only the zero interest rate policies of the world’s major central banks during this period have kept debt servicing costs at tolerable levels...|$|R
