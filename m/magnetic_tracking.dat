The way using electromagnetic effect for braking, is known as the electromagnetic brake. According to the application of electromagnetic brake implementation on rail transit vehicle, there are two main types: electromagnetic rail brake and electromagnetic eddy current brake. Electromagnetic rail brake (also called <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> brake) is a kind of contact friction braking, basing on the wheel/rail adhesion. The electromagnetic force sucks the <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> brake which mounted on bogie and rail. Through the device {{at the bottom of the}} magnetic rail wear, the sliding friction between the plate and rails, train the kinetic energy into heat energy and make it escape into the atmosphere, so as to realize the train slowing down or stop.

Often a motion tracker, such as a <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> device or inertial tracking device, is attached to capture the global position/rotation data of the glove. These movements are then interpreted by the software that accompanies the glove, so any one movement can mean any number of things. Gestures can then be categorized into useful information, such as to recognize sign language or other symbolic functions.|$|E
50|$|An {{acoustic}} tracking system is copied {{from the nature}} systems of positioning and orientation. Bats or dolphins navigate in space using ultrasound.Acoustic tracking measures the time during which a particular acoustic signal reaches the receiver. There {{are two ways to}} determine the position of the object: to measure time-of-arrival of the sound wave from the transmitter to the receivers or the phase coherence of the sinusoidal sound wave by receiving the transfer.The main problem with such kind of tracking is absolute position of the object is not known but only periodic changes in its location in separate periods of time. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> has been implemented in Logitech Tracking.|$|E

40|$|In a <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> system, the {{position}} and orientation of a coil is determined by its low frequency (LF) magnetic interactions with a coil array of known position and orientation. There are two main types of systems: (i) the coil with unknown position works as a transmitter with a receiving array of sensors, or (ii) the coil array is the transmitter and the coil with unknown position is used as sensor. As LF magnetic fields do not interact with the human body, <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> is particularly well-suited for tracking of objects {{in and around the}} human body. For example, this tracking technique has in recent years been proposed for eye tracking, tracking of tongue movements, and organ-positioning during radiotherapy. We focus on an organ-positioning system for use during radiotherapy. The system, which is of type (i) above, consists of a transmitter that is implanted near the organ of interest and an external array of sensors. Of particular interest is the spatial layout of the sensor array, since this strongly influences the performance of the tracking system. A well-designed sensor array will give good positioning accuracy whereas an ill-designed array can result in an unsolvable positioning problem. In this work, we use Fisher-information theory from the field of optimal measurements to formulate an optimization problem for the layout of the sensor array. Furthermore, we solve the optimization problem and discuss the implications of the results on the design of <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> systems...|$|E

40|$|Intensity-modulated {{radiation}} therapy (IMRT) requires real-time tumor tracking to allow precise {{delivery of the}} prescribed dose of radiation to the tumor and reduce damage to the surrounding tissue. A small size and low power wireless active transponder implanted {{in the vicinity of}} the tumor with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> system placed outside the patient 2 ̆ 7 s body can be used to locate the position of the tumor during the {{radiation therapy}}. The wireless active transponder uses a magnetic sensor to sense the magnetic field generated by the <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> system, and then transmits the magnetic field information back to the computer wirelessly using on/off keying (OOK) for tumor tracking. One of the challenges faced by an implantable device is that the device must consume as little power as possible for prolonged battery lifetime or battery-less remote-powered operations. To significantly reduce the power consumption of the wireless transponder, various low-voltage low-power design techniques are proposed in this dissertation. These techniques include low-voltage designs, time-division scheme, a low-power low-area-penalty sensor front-end topology, and low-power voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). Using these low-power techniques, a wireless active transponder is implemented in 130 -nm CMOS technology. The developed wireless active transponder consumes only 912 μW, and does not use any area-intensive integrated inductors. This ultra-low-power wireless inductorless active transponder only occupies an area of less than 4 mm 2. Measurements show that the wireless transponder is able to provide tumor tracking with an error of less than 5 mm using the <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> system. ...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> {{has been}} applied in many {{biomedical}} settings due to the transparency {{of the human body}} to low-frequency magnetic fields. One way to improve system performance and/or reduce system cost is to optimize the sensor positions of the tracking system. In this work, the sensor positions of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> system are optimized by exploiting an analytical model where the transmitting and sensing coils of the system are approximated by magnetic dipoles. In order to compare different sensor array layouts, two performance measures based on the Fisher information matrix are discussed and compared for the optimization of the sensor positions of a circular sensor array. Furthermore, the sensor positioning problem is formulated as an optimization problem which is cast as a sensor selection problem. The sensor selection problem is solved for a planar sensor array by the application of a convex relaxation. Several transmitter positions are considered and general results are established for the dependence of the optimal sensor positions on the transmitter’s position and orientation. </p...|$|E
50|$|Shingled {{magnetic}} recording (SMR) is a magnetic storage data recording technology used in hard disk drives (HDDs) to increase storage density and overall per-drive storage capacity. Conventional hard disk drives record data by writing non-overlapping <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracks</b> parallel {{to each other}} (perpendicular recording), while shingled recording writes new tracks that overlap part of the previously written <b>magnetic</b> <b>track,</b> leaving the previous track narrower and allowing for higher track density. Thus, the tracks partially overlap similar to roof shingles. This approach was selected because physical limitations prevent recording magnetic heads from having the same width as reading heads, leaving recording heads wider.|$|R
