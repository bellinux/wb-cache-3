40|$|Understanding the {{evolution}} of faults from their blind phase to a mature stage (i. e. surfacebreaking faults) is fundamental in active tectonic studies because conventional analyses for identifying and characterizing the earthquake potential of large continental faults rely largely on surface evidence of faults. In brittle crust, faults form and propagate by linking small tensile cracks. A plethora of studies dealt with fault propagation mechanisms using diﬀerent approaches, from theoretical formulations to ﬁeld analyses to numerical and analogue simulations (see Mandl, 2000; Scholz, 2000; and Gudmundsson, 2011 for a summary). In an isotropic material, the propagation of faults is controlled by rock toughness and applied stress.

40|$|Basin-edge lobate scarps are a {{sub-type of}} tectonic {{shortening}} structure {{on the surface}} of Mercury that have formed at the edge of volcanic units that fill or partly fill impact basins. We have performed a global survey of these features and find that they are widespread in basins across the planet. We obtained model ages from crater size–frequency distribution analysis for a subset of our surveyed basins, for both the smooth plains infill and for the last resolvable tectonic activity on the associated basin- edge scarps. Our results indicate that some of these lobate scarps were still accumulating strain in the late Mansurian (approximately 1 Ga). From a photogeological assessment, we find that the orientations of these basin-edge lobate scarps are similar to those reported for the global population of lobate scarps in earlier studies, appearing to align ∼north–south at low latitudes and ∼east–west at higher latitudes. However, reassessing these landforms’ orientation with artificially illuminated topographic data does not allow us to rule out the effect of illumination bias.

40|$|The {{formation}} of mechanical discontinuities (i. e., bedding, joint planes) {{is one of}} the main effects of weathering in rock masses. It is also highly important for forecasting the geotechnical properties of a rock mass in the future. The effect is well known in most rock types, but the mechanisms of forming discontinuities and the resulting variation of mechanical discontinuities throughout a rock mass especially in sedimentary rocks such as sandstone in a tropical environment, are often still poorly understood. The aim of this research is to study and understand the discontinuity formation process in a tropical environment. In sandstone in Sabah, Malaysia, discontinuity spacing decreases with higher weathering grades as expected. Three main discontinuity sets are formed and the spacings of the discontinuity sets formed in the thickly bedded sandstone reduced. The discontinuity development is related to weathering processes and governed by predefined, i. e., incipient or internal, planes of weakness that originate during early stages of rock formation and in response to the past and present three-dimensional stress field(s).

The dominant direction of fractures corresponds to the NE-SW direction which also coincides with the dominant orientation of the hydrographic network.

40|$|International audienceA {{synthesis}} of existing borehole data and seismic profiles {{has been conducted}} in the Artois area (northern France), along the northern border of the Paris basin, in order to explore the possible control exerted at depth by the Upper Carboniferous Variscan thrust front {{on the distribution of}} Late Paleozoic-Mesozoic depositional centers and their subsequent uplift in Tertiary times. Such control was demonstrated recently in the Weald-Boulonnais basin (Eastern Channel area) that forms the western prolongation of the area under study but was so far poorly constrained in the Artois area. Presented data provide evidence for the topography of the Artois hills and the altitude of sedimentary layers to be controlled by the activity of a network of relaying WNW-ESE striking faults inducing the systematic uplift of the southern fault blocks. Those steeply S-dipping faults branch downward onto the ramp of the Variscan thrusts forming lis tric faults that locally Iimit to the north buried half-graben structures, filled with fan-shaped fluviatile Stephanian-Permian deposits. Such c 1 ear syn-rift geometry shows that the ramp of the main Variscan frontal thrust (the Midi thrust) has been reactivated as a normal fault in Stephanian-Permian times thus forming a very demonstrative example of a negative inversion process. The reverse offset of the transgressive Middle Cretaceous-Lower Eocene layers covering unconformably the Paleozoic substratum argue for a Tertiary (Middle Eocene-Late Oligocene?) contractional reactivation of the fault network thereby documenting a repeated inversion process along the Artois Variscan thrust front. The Variscan frontal thrust zone is thus shown here to represent a prominent crustal-scale <b>mechanical</b> <b>discontinuity</b> that localized deformation in the Artois-Boulonnais area since Upper Paleozoic times...|$|E

Dots of metal film and grooves {{have been used}} as reflectors; reflection is caused by the <b>mechanical</b> <b>discontinuity.</b> This research project is a study of an alternative reflector, the thin metal dot, which reflects by interacting with the electric field that accompanies the SAW on a piezo-electric material. Experimental work is done on Y-cut LiNbO 3, a common SAW material, the aim being to characterise the reflection mechanism sufficiently to design devices, particularly on this material. Reflectivities of a large range of dot sizes is reported. Velocity change due to dots, another parameter required in device design, is also measured. In addition, holes in a metal film, physically the opposite of dots, are also studied. A theorectical model is developed to predict the behaviour of dots in devices. For a Z -propagating wave in LiNbO 3, the SAW velocity for completely free and completely metallised surfaces were used to specify the properties of the material. For propagation in other directions on the surface, particularly near the X direction, a different acoustic mode, the Leaky Surface Wave (LSW), has an influence on SAW reflections, and the model also requires the LSW velocities under the same two conditions. The model uses these parameters, together with dot geometry, to determine reflectivity in any direction and velocity change due to the dots. The results agree well with experiments. A device (a RAC) is designed using this model, to bring out any unforseen difficulties in the use of dot arrays. The device performed as expected except for some unanticipated attenuation in the arrays, which can almost certainly be predictably allowed for in future designs, being broadband and not very severe. </p...|$|E

We studied Ca 2 waves underlying TPCs in rat cardiac trabeculae under experimental conditions that simulate the functional nonuniformity caused by local mechanical or ischemic local damage of myocardium. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>discontinuity</b> along the trabeculae {{was created by}} exposing the preparation to a small jet of solution with a composition that reduces excitation–contraction coupling (ECC) in myocytes within that segment. The jet solution contained either caffeine (5 mmol/L), 2, 3 -butanedione monoxime (BDM; 20 mmol/L), or low Ca 2 concentration ([Ca 2]; 0. 2 mmol/L). Force was measured with a silicon strain gauge and sarcomere length with laser diffraction techniques in 15 trabeculae. Simultaneously, [Ca 2]i was measured locally using epifluorescence of Fura- 2. The jet of solution was applied perpendicularly to a small muscle region (200 to 300 m) at constant flow. When the jet contained caffeine, BDM, or low [Ca 2], during the stimulated twitch, muscle-twitch force decreased and the sarcomeres in the exposed segment were stretched by shortening normal regions outside the jet. Typical protocols for TPC induction (7. 5 s- 2. 5 Hz stimulus trains at 23 °C; [Ca 2]o 2. 0 mmol/L) reproducibly generated Ca 2 waves that arose from the border between shortening and stretched regions. Such Ca 2 waves started during force-relaxation of the last stimulated twitch of the train and propagated (0. 2 to 2. 8 mm/sec) into segments {{both inside and outside}} of the jet.

The possible existence of detachment levels beneath the Ceraunius Fossae area were investigated using the lost-area balancing method and a topographic profile derived from Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data. Results suggest a marked difference in structural style between the western and eastern sectors of the study area, which is interpreted as a result of different mechanical stratigraphies. On the western sector the maximum depth reached by grabens is well localized within 1000 m from the topographic surface suggesting the existence of a detachment level, which we interpret as a weak horizon {{at the base of the}} Late Hesperian-Early Amazonian units. The ductile behaviour of this horizon could be favoured by the presence of volatile reservoir or ice. In the eastern sector of the profile (HNf and Hf units) the maximum depth reached by the grabens is scattered and does not support the existence of clearly defined detachment horizons suggesting that Noachian Fractured Rocks are mechanically homogeneous.

Rock <b>mechanical</b> <b>discontinuity</b> surveys provide valuable information regarding the discontinuity geometry that can likely contribute to the evaluation of flow through individual fractures with variable properties. The hydraulic aperture is available for the transmission of flow, while normal and shear stresses alter discontinuity properties over time. In this, numerous advances have been made to better accommodate deviations of natural discontinuity geometry to that of smooth parallel plates and at partial saturation. The paper addresses these advances and details conditions under which the cubic law, even in local form, fails to adequately estimate the hydraulic properties. The role of roughness in open discontinuities is addressed in particular, as contact areas and high amplitude roughness cause most extensive deviation from the cubic law. Aperture of open fractures still governs hydraulic properties, but inertial forces control flow in very rough fractures, in which instances the applicability of the cubic law should be revisited.

40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} of Cenozoic stress {{patterns in the}} northern North Sea and the mid-Norwegian margin is presented, {{and the sense of}} potential slip along major fault planes belonging to the two areas is restored. We assume that the main regional source of stresses is the Atlantic ridge push as demonstrated by previous studies. Furthermore, we also assume a nearly consistent NW-SE strike for the far-field stress from continental breakup between Greenland and Norway (earliest Eocene) to present day. First, we applied the commercial two-dimensional distinct element method (UDEC) to simulate Cenozoic stress and displacement patterns in the study area. Variations in rheology and major fault zones were introduced into the model. The Møore-Trøondelag Fault Complex and its inferred continuation into the Shetland Platform forms the major <b>mechanical</b> <b>discontinuity</b> in the model. Second, we used the SORTAN method, developed at the University of Paris VI, to predict the sense of potential slip along major fault planes. The input for the SORTAN model was constrained by the geometry of the selected fault planes and local principal stress directions extracted from the UDEC modeling. Our results show that the Møore-Trøondelag Fault Complex and its inferred continuation into the Shetland Platform act as a weak fault zone. This fault zone divides the study area into two different stress provinces: the continental margin and the northern North Sea. This result agrees well with the observed differences in Cenozoic structural evolution of the two areas. Compressive structures are observed along the continental margin, whereas relative tectonic quiescence characterizes the northern North Sea during the Tertiary. The restored stress patterns in the northern North Sea and the mid-Norwegian margin also agree well with the observed present-day stress configuration. Our analysis demonstrates a method to reconstruct the sense of slip on major fault planes by combining two complementary numerical tools (UDEC and SORTAN). As a result, it is demonstrated that oblique-slip motions are mainly expected, in particular, strike-slip and reverse dip-slip faulting are simulated...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo better {{understand}} the role of groundwater-level changes on rock-slope deformation and damage, a carbonate rock slope (30 m x 30 m x 15 m) was extensively instrumented for mesoscale hydraulic and mechanical measurements during water-level changes. The slope is naturally drained by a spring that can be artificially closed or opened by a water gate. In this study, a 2 -h slope-dewatering experiment was analyzed. Changes in fluid pressure and deformation were simultaneously monitored, both at discontinuities and in the intact rock, using short-base extensometers and pressure gauges as well as tiltmeters fixed at the slope surface. Field data were analyzed with different coupled hydromechanical (HM) codes (ROCMAS, FLAC 3 D, and UDEC). Field data indicate that, in the faults, a 40 kPa pressure fall occurs in 2 min and induces a 0. 5 - 31 x 10 - 6 m normal closure. Pressure fall is slower in the bedding-planes, lasting 120 min, with no normal deformation. No pressure change or deformation is observed in the intact rock. The slope surface displays a complex tilt towards {{the interior of the}} slope, with magnitudes ranging from 0. 6 to 15 x 10 - 6 rad. Close agreement with model for both slope surface and internal measurements is obtained when a high variability in slope-element properties is introduced into the models, with normal stiffnesses of kn_faults = 10 - 3 x kn_bedding-planes and permeabilities of kh_faults = 103 x kh_bedding-planes. A nonlinear correlation between hydraulic and <b>mechanical</b> <b>discontinuity</b> properties is proposed and related to discontinuity damage. A parametric study shows that 90 % of slope deformation depends on HM effects in a few highly permeable and highly deformable discontinuities located in the basal, saturated part of the slope while the remaining 10 % is related to elasto-plastic deformations in the low-permeability discontinuities induced by complex stress/strain transfers from the high-permeability zones. The periodicity and magnitude of free water-surface movements cause 10 - 20 % variations in those local stress/strain accumulations related to the contrasting HM behavior for high- and low-permeability elements of the slope. Finally, surface-tilt monitoring coupled with internal localized pressure/deformation measurements appears to be a promising method for characterizing the HM properties and behavior of a slope, and for detecting its progressive destabilization...|$|E
40|$|The Alhambra {{is built}} on a conglomeratic formation, known as the Alhambra Formation, whose age is Pliocene to Lower Pleistocene and has a visible {{thickness}} of 200 metres. The {{western part of the}} San Pedro escarpment corresponds to a fault-scarp with some retreat; the fault-plane outcrops in the innermost part of the escarpment, showing normal displacement and NW-SE strike with NE steep dip. This fault is the most important one of a set that outcrops along the northern hillslope of the Alhambra. Several topographic steps with NW-SE orientation are interpreted as retreated fault-scarps. In some cases, the activity of these faults seems to be very recent and maybe related to earthquakes. The seismic risk associated with these faults (and maybe some not-outcropping ones) can be taken to be moderate, as some historical damages have been reported concerning the Alhambra walls and the fence. In this respect, the Alhambra fence has numerous cracks geometrically related to fault planes outcropping in the Alhambra Formation, i. e. faults and cracks are continuous and have similar strike and dip. We hypothesize that these cracks are due to small displacements along the faults, occurred during recent earthquakes in the region. These faults constitute <b>mechanical</b> <b>discontinuities,</b> which represent a supplementary risk, because they contribute to reduce the stability of the entire rock massi...|$|R
40|$|Compared to more {{traditional}} techniques, {{the application of}} Externally Bonded-Fibre Reinforced Polymers (EB-FRP) represents a viable alternative for the strengthening of masonry structures, also in case of Cultural Heritage buildings where strict requirements need to be met, aimed at minimizing {{the impact of the}} intervention. Since the FRP-to-masonry bond behaviour strongly affects design and effectiveness of such interventions, several investigations have been carried out in recent years to study this phenomenon, generally based on the longer experience developed for concrete substrates. Mortar joints, which are geometrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>discontinuities,</b> distinguish and characterize masonry substrates from concrete ones, and therefore deserve a special attention as far as their role in the bond behaviour is not clarified yet. This paper, aimed at giving a contribution also from a methodological point of view, presents the main experimental results of shear tests carried out on glass composites (GFRP) applied to natural calcareous stones (pietra leccese), to lime mortar blocks and to masonry prisms made by coupling stones and lime mortar. Overall 22 shear tests were performed, keeping a bonded length of 200 mm for stones and mortar specimens while it was changed from 65 mm (corresponding to one stone and one mortar joint) to 195 mm (three stones and three mortar joints) in the case of masonry prisms. The effect of the FRP end anchorage on the test development was investigated as well, and results of the experimental tests are herein discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of fracturing and cataclasis influences the mechanical and permeability properties of fault zones. Fault zones can behave as strong or weak <b>mechanical</b> <b>discontinuities</b> and as conduits or barriers to fluid flow mainly {{depending on the}} nature and amount of cataclastic rocks that developed in their cores. Our structural investigations in fault zones affecting carbonate platform rocks in the Apennines, Italy, allow us to propose an evolutionary model for the progressive development of cataclastic fault core rocks from damage zones, and for the progression of cataclasis in fault cores. Analyses of particle size in the cataclastic rocks show power law distributions with fractal dimensions spanning over a broad range. This suggests {{that the idea of}} a persistent fragmentation mechanism (self-similar cataclasis) for describing the entire {{evolution of}} natural cataclastic fault cores in carbonate rocks is inadequate. Self-similar evolution for the cataclastic process is a concept mainly derived from laboratory experiments and micromechanical modelling. Conversely, we propose that the fragmentation mechanism progressively changes with the intensity of comminution. Slip localisation within narrow shear bands is favoured when a favourable cataclastic fabric with fractal dimensions D ~ 2. 6 - 2. 7 is achieved in the fault zone. Intense comminution in the narrow shear zones produces the preferential formation of small diameter particles resulting in particle size distributions characterised by D-values approaching or exceeding 3. The progression pathway of fracturing in damage zones and the non self-similar evolution of cataclasis in fault rocks have an important impact on the frictional and permeability properties of fault zones...|$|R
