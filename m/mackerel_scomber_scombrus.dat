40|$|This {{study shows}} some {{nutritional}} values and metal components of health concern in fish {{sources such as}} <b>mackerel</b> (Titus) <b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus,</b> shawa Sardinella eba and kotwe Carangoides armatus meant for public consumption in Nigeria. The moisture content, ash content, crude fat, crude protein, crude fibre, vitamin A and vitamin C were determined. Titus <b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus</b> showed highest value of vitamin A (96. 7 i. u), while kotwe recorded relatively high value of vitamin C (0. 60 mg/ 100 g) compared with other fish sources. Variations in the levels of some metal components can serve as measure of pollution, especially the amount of lead (P) (1. 09 %) and iron (Fe) (2. 0 %) in Titus <b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus</b> could be an indication of pollution for this fish sources or possibly result of biomagnifications. The moisture and ash content of the sampled fish sources during the study ranged from 66. 7 % to 77. 5 % and 3. 79 % to 4. 03 %, respectively. Total bacterial count estimated for fish samples studied were 113 x 104 cfu/mL for Titus, 40 x 104 cfu/mL for Sardinella eba (shawa) while coliform count gave value of 9. 5 x 103 cfu/mL and 9. 65 x 104 cfu/mL for both fish sources, respectively. Generally, this study shows that <b>mackerel</b> (Titus) <b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus</b> has more nutritional quality than other two fish sources analyzed, that is, shawa Sardinella eba and kotwe Carangoides armatus.

In this study, direct calorimetry was used to analyze the energy density of seven pelagic species collected over four seasons from the western Mediterranean Sea: anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, sardine Sardina pilchardus, round sardinella Sardinella aurita, horse mackerels Trachurus trachurus and T. mediterraneus, and <b>mackerels</b> <b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus</b> and S. colias.

Energy density of each species varied over time, with the exception of S. colitis, likely due to its high energetic requirements related to migration throughout the year. In general, higher energy density was observed in spring for all species, regardless of their breeding strategy, probably as a consequence of the late-winter phytoplankton bloom. These results provide new insights into the temporal availability of energy in the pelagic ecosystem of the Mediterranean Sea, which are pivotal for understanding how the population dynamics of small and medium pelagic fishes and their predators may respond to environmental changes and fishing impacts.

50|$|In 1866 the Royal Commission on the Sea Fisheries, which {{included}} among its officers Professor Thomas Henry Huxley, had reported that fears of over-exploitation {{of the sea}} fisheries were unfounded. They recommended removing existing laws regulating fishing grounds and closed seasons. However, {{the increase in the}} size and number of fishing vessels was causing widespread concern, and there were reports from all around the UK coasts about the scarcity of particular fish. This concern was expressed at the International Fisheries Exhibition in London in 1883, a conference called to discuss the commercial and scientific aspects of the fishing industry, and which was attended by many leading scientists of the day. Nevertheless, in his opening address, Huxley discounted reports of fish scarcities and repeated the views of the Royal Commission of 1866. He stated that with existing methods of fishing, it was inconceivable that the great sea fisheries, such as those for cod (Gadus morhua), herring (Clupea harengus) and <b>mackerel</b> (<b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus),</b> could ever be exhausted.|$|E
50|$|Like most gulls, {{they also}} capture fish with some {{regularity}} and will readily capture any fish smaller than itself found {{close to the}} surface of the water. Whether caught or eaten after death or injury from other sources, stomach contents of great black-backed gulls usually show fish to be the primary food. On Sable Island in Nova Scotia, 25% of the stomach contents were comprised by fish but 96% of the regurgitations given to young was made up fish. Similarly, on Great Island in Newfoundland, 25% of the stomach contents were fish but 68% of regurgitants were fish. The most regularly reported fish eaten in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morrhua), Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod), Atlantic <b>mackerel</b> (<b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus),</b> Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus). Other prey often includes various squid, Jonah crabs (Cancer borealis), rock crabs (Cancer irroratus), sea urchins, green crabs (Carcinus maenas), starfish (Asterias forbesi and Asterias rubens) and other echinoderms, crustaceans and mollusks when they come across the opportunity. From observations in northern New England, 23% of observed prey was echinoderms and 63% was crustaceans.|$|E

Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are stocked in rivers and estuaries each year. The Ogunquit River sustains alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), pollock (Pollachius virens), bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosus), and winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus). The Webhannet River has native {{species such as}} winter flounder, northern pipefish (Syngnathus fuscus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), common mummichog, Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) and Atlantic mackerel. The Merriland River sustains populations of American eel, brown trout, and brook trout. The Mousam River attracts little skate (Raja erinacea), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), bluefish, cunner, Atlantic <b>mackerel</b> (<b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus),</b> pollock, and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). The Spurwink River supports blueback herring, Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), American shad, pollock, cunner, winter flounder, and little skate. Striped bass and brown trout are popular recreational fishing resources in the area. The National Marine Fisheries Service has designated as “essential fish habitat” areas that provide substrate necessary for fish spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. Estuaries within the refuge boundaries are part of that essential fish habitat.|$|E
