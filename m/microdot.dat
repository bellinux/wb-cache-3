5|$|In 1961, the Portland Spy Ring was uncovered. Peter and Helen Kroger {{were found}} to have been involved, while living in Ruislip. They were visited each Saturday evening by Gordon Lonsdale and were {{eventually}} placed under police surveillance. The Krogers were eventually arrested and found to have codes, a <b>microdot</b> reader and film of the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment in Portland Harbour concealed within ordinary household items. A radio transmitter hidden in the garden was not retrieved until 1977.|$|E
5|$|Upon his arrival, Bond is {{contacted}} by Aki, {{assistant to the}} head of the Japanese secret service, Tiger Tanaka, while watching sumo. Aki introduces Bond to local MI6 operative Dikko Henderson. Henderson claims to have critical evidence about the rogue craft, but is killed before he can elaborate. Bond chases and kills the assailant, taking the assailant's clothing as a disguise and escapes in the getaway car, which goes to Osato Chemicals. Once there, Bond subdues the driver and breaks into the office safe of president Mr. Osato. After obtaining certain documents, Bond is pursued by armed security, but is rescued by Aki, who flees to a secluded subway station. Bond chases her, but falls down a trap door leading to Tanaka's office. The stolen documents are examined and found to include a photograph of the cargo ship Ning-Po with a <b>microdot</b> message saying the tourist who took the photo was killed as a security precaution.|$|E

5000|$|During {{and after}} World War II, espionage agents used photographically-produced <b>microdots</b> to send {{information}} back and forth. <b>Microdots</b> were typically minute (less than {{the size of}} the period produced by a typewriter). World War II <b>microdots</b> were embedded in the paper and covered with an adhesive, such as collodion. That was reflective and so was detectable by viewing against glancing light. Alternative techniques included inserting <b>microdots</b> into slits cut into the edge of postcards.|$|R
50|$|In Germany {{after the}} Berlin Wall was erected, special cameras {{were used to}} {{generate}} <b>microdots</b> which were then adhered to letters and sent via normal means.

2500|$|Since {{the turn}} of the {{millennium}} Sony has released [...] more Kalahari Surfers albums. Akasic Record (2001) is [...] "a highly sophisticated foray into African-flavoured dubfunk"; Muti Media (2003) features a sculpture by Brett Murray on the cover, and Zukile Malahlana from Marekta appears on the album. Conspiracy of Silence (2005) and Panga Management (2007) followed. One Party State (2010) was released on <b>Microdot</b> and debuted at the African Soul Rebels Tour in the UK alongside Oumou Sangaré & Orchestre Poly-Rythmo De Cotonou. It features Sowetan poet Lesego Rampolokeng on four tracks. The Mail & Guardian called it [...] "a politically drenched album... track for track the most solid South African release of 2010". The Kalahari Surfers performed at the Cape Town Electronic Music Festival in early 2012, and released a live album of the performance. Agitprop was released later in 2012, on Sjambok Music; it was first played at the Unyazi Festival in Durban in September. Agitprop explores Sony's fears about South Africa in the 2010s becoming a one party state under the African National Congress, and includes a song about chemical warfare scientist Wouter Basson. South African Rolling Stone compared it to the KLF, Sly and Robbie and Pink Floyd, and described its [...] "slow evolution of nuance" [...] towards the [...] "desolately upbeat" [...] "Hostile Takeover". Sony says the album was mostly written on the train while commuting to work; he calls the genre [...] "Voktronic, ... a blend of folktronic, and volkspiele with a dose of electronic experimental dubstoep and experimental rolled up into one fat two blade stereo hit." ...|$|E

40|$|The Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph (APLC) is a {{promising}} coronagraphic device for direct exoplanets detection on the European-Extremely Large Telescope. We present new near-IR laboratory results using binary apodizers [...] the so-called <b>microdots</b> apodizer [...] which represent {{a very attractive}} and advantageous solution for the APLC. <b>Microdots</b> apodizers introduce high-frequency noise whose characteristics depend on the pixel size.

Estimation of both the noise intensity and its localization in the field of view is the objective of this study. Stray-light diffraction introduced by the finite pixel size was measured during experiment. Intensity decreases, and radial distance increases, when the pixel size gets smaller. The physical properties of these <b>microdots</b> apodizers have been demonstrated in laboratory. The <b>microdots</b> apodizer is a suitable solution for any coronagraph using pupil amplitude apodization if properly designed. Comment: Accepted in Astronomy and Astrophysics 200...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{fabrication}} of ultrathin selective molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) <b>microdots</b> using polymerization by evanescent waves (PEW) is demonstrated {{for the first}} time. A specific prepolymerization mixture exhibiting suitable photosentivity at 405 nm was developed, containing in particular the visible-light photoinitiator bis(2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoyl) -phenylphosphineoxide. PEW allows for nanometric resolution of the MIP dots in the z-scale. Within a few seconds, {{it is possible to}} generate molecularly imprinted <b>microdots</b> with sub- 100 nm thickness. The amino acid Z-(l) -phenylalanine was used as model imprinting template, and the fluorescent dansyl-phenylalanine was employed as a fluorescently labeled derivative for the recognition tests.

30|$|Superhydrophobic {{aluminum}} surfaces {{have been}} prepared by means of electrodeposition of copper on aluminum surfaces, followed by electrochemical modification using stearic acid organic molecules. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the electrodeposited copper films follow “island growth mode” {{in the form of}} <b>microdots</b> and their number densities increase with the rise of the negative deposition potentials. At an electrodeposition potential of − 0.2 V the number density of the copper <b>microdots</b> are found to be 4.5 × 104 cm− 2 that are increased to 2.9 × 105 cm− 2 at a potential of − 0.8 V. Systematically, the distances between the <b>microdots</b> are found to be reduced from 26.6 μm to 11.03 μm with the increase of negative electrochemical potential from − 0.2 V to − 0.8 V. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses have confirmed the formation of copper stearate on the stearic acid modified copper films. The roughness of the stearic acid modified electrodeposited copper films is found to increase with the increase in the density of the copper <b>microdots.</b> A critical copper deposition potential of − 0.6 V in conjunction with the stearic acid modification provides a surface roughness of 6.2 μm with a water contact angle of 157 °, resulting in superhydrophobic properties on the aluminum substrates.|$|R

50|$|An actual <b>microdot</b> {{technique}} {{was used for}} steganographic purposes in Germany between World War I and World War II.
