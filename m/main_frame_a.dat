Initially, the Frames were to feature unique transformations, but he determined that flying and skating with Jehuty was enjoyable on its own. As a joke, Shinkawa placed the cockpit in the Frames' crotch region. The staff first had the idea of naming a Frame Anubis based on Egyptian mythology; this led to the name Jehuty for the <b>main</b> <b>Frame,</b> <b>a</b> reference to the Egyptian deity, Djehuti. LEVs were intended to appear during the gameplay as weak, easy opponents that would target Jehuty and the Raptors; however, they ultimately appeared only during cutscenes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a method and computer programs for computing the normal forms of ordinary differential equations whose Jacobian matrix evaluated at an equilibrium involves semi-simple eigenvalues. The method {{can be used}} to deal with systems which are not necessarily described on a center manifold. An iterative procedure is developed for finding the closed-form expressions of the normal forms and associated nonlinear transformations. Computer programs using a symbolic computer language Maple are developed to facilitate the application of the method. The programs can be conveniently executed on a <b>main</b> <b>frame,</b> <b>a</b> workstation or a PC machine without any interaction. A number of examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the method and the computation efficiency of the Maple programs...|$|E
40|$|An {{intelligent}} peripheral system {{is defined by}} us as any IT-technology component which serves in the neighbourhood of a computing systems (a <b>main</b> <b>frame,</b> <b>a</b> personal computer, a signal processing system, a micro controller etc) in an intelligent manner. The network and the interface for the connection of an {{intelligent peripheral}} system to the main station {{can also be considered}} as an integrating part of peripheral systems. We want to consider in our presentation specific intelligent peripheral systems consisting of holons in a hierarchical network in the sense of Arthur Koestler. In the first part the concept of a holon and the related holarchical structure of a network is presented. It is pointed out that holons and associated networks can be described by the concept of an intelligent agent following the terminology as introduced by Ferber. Furthermore, dynamical systems of different kind {{can be used as a}} concept for modeling holons and can be organized to get a holonic hierarchical structure. As an example we present this in the case of finite state machines. Possible application of our concepts can be found in modern systems of information technology such as mobile communication networks and computer systems where intelligent “add on ” devices can be considered as holonic peripheral system components in our sense...|$|E

The exact cycle time can usually only be assessed by simulation. To avoid time-consuming simulation runs we present several approaches on how to approximate the tool cycle time of lots...|$|R
