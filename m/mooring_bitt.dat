This paper {{provides some of the}} findings about the accuracy of distances measured by means of the system, the accuracy of fixes based on measured distances and some results of the numerical simulation. The examination ship "Kakusui" with microphone A hung from it was moored at the wharf of Togitsu harbor, and microphone B was hung from the <b>mooring</b> <b>bitt</b> on the wharf. Points A and B consist of the base line. The boat "Asagiri" with a transponder hung from it was shifted about 100 m and anchored for each measurement. Three dimensions were measured continuously by the tracking unit, and the intersection angles at point A and C were measured by sextants from 5 to 10 times at each measurement point. The length of the base line was measured by a tapeline. Based on these data supplied from computation and measurement, the differences of measured distances and the displacements of fixes were obtained. The standard deviations of the differences between measured distances and calculated distances show a variation ranging from 0. 6 to 1. 9 % according to the measured distance. Therefore it is irrelevant to use the standard deviation of the total measurements. The measured fixes were scattered mostly {{in the direction of the}} X axis from the calculated fixes, and the maximum values of long and short radii of the 1 Ïƒ error ellipses were about 40 m and 20 m respectively. These values were less than the maximum value of the displacement by the numerical simulation and it is equal to or less than the variable error of Decca (electronic navigational apparatus). In order to keep or improve the accuracy of measured fixes, we will have to steer the ship in such a way that an underwater object is kept on the transverse side of the base line...|$|E

In the second step, the rope {{is tied to}} the bitt, as shown. This tie can be put and {{released}} very quickly. In quiet conditions, such as on a lake, one person can moor a 260-tonne ship in just a few minutes.|$|R
