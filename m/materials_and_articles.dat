40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of the}} regulations for food contact <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>articles</b> is {{the protection of the}} consumer. In order to fulfill this goal, the Commission of the European Communities has published 21 Directives during the last 30 years, most of which are related to plastic <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>articles</b> intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. This review of E. U. Regulations provides the basic rules necessary for testing migration of constituents of plastic materials such as the migration test conditions (times and temperatures), selection of food simulants, substitute fat test for overall and specific migration, determination of overall and specific migration and migration limits for some monomers and other starting substances. In Arabic Countries, there are no legislations which organize the use of plastic <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>articles</b> intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. For this reason, the authors suggest that Arab authorities may lay down the necessary legislations for quality control of plastic <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>articles</b> intended to come into contact with foodstuffs, and to establish the needed laboratories equipped with all modern analytical techniques for the purpose of the determination of overall and specific migration levels from the plastic <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>articles</b> into foodstuffs...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to create a general picture of the Taita Hills region in southeastern Kenya, through {{describing}} its natural environment and its historical as well as its social background. Also, the human impact on this vulnerable environment will be discussed briefly. Not much has been written on the specific area of the Taita Hills apart from scholarly articles or environmental program reports on e. g. biodiversity, so I will have to deal with the problem of limited material. The data used for this paper is not first-hand, e. g. interviews, instead all information is gathered from maps, archival <b>material,</b> <b>and</b> <b>articles</b> from journals or other academic resources. Most information will have to be compiled from more general books and Internet sources on Kenya. The research will be conducted in a geographic context, but the attempt is basically to create a regional overview of the Taita Hills and to touch on a few critical issues concerning the human-environment issues in the area...|$|R

In order to fulfil this goal many analytical questions must be answered in the next few years.

Using well established gas chromatographic methods for the detection of volatiles and new techniques involving supercritical gases for the analysis of minimally volatile constituents both specific and overall migration can be investigated.

40|$|Terms of {{reference}} The Committee {{is asked to}} re-evaluate the hazards to human health arising from the migration of bisphenol A present in certain plastic <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>articles</b> intended to {{come into contact with}} foodstuffs. Background The substance 2, 2 -bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) propane, CAS Number 80 - 05 - 7, more commonly known as bisphenol A (BPA), is used as a monomer in the manufacture of polycarbonates and epoxy resins, as an antioxidant in PVC plastics and as an inhibitor of end polymerisation in PVC. Polycarbonates are used in food contact materials such as returnable beverage bottles, infant feeding bottles, tableware (plates and mugs) and storage containers. Epoxy resins are used in protective linings for food and beverage cans and vats. BPA was first evaluated in 1986 by the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) for use in plastic <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>articles</b> intended to come into contact with foodstuffs.
