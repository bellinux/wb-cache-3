40|$|Carotenoids {{are used}} in animal {{nutrition}} mainly as sensory additives that favourably affect the colour of fish, birds and food of animal origin. Various analytical methods exist for their quantification in compound feed, reflecting the different physico-chemical characteristics of the carotenoid and the corresponding feed additives. They may be natural products or specific formulations containing the target carotenoids produced by chemical synthesis. In this study a <b>multi-analyte</b> <b>method</b> was developed {{that can be applied}} to the determination of all 10 carotenoids currently authorised within the European Union for compound feedingstuffs. The method functions regardless of whether the carotenoids have been added to the compound feed via natural products or specific formulations. It is comprised of three steps: (1) digestion of the feed sample with an enzyme; (2) pressurised liquid extraction; and (3) quantification of the analytes by reversed-phase HPLC coupled to a photodiode array detector in the visible range. The method was single-laboratory validated for poultry and fish feed covering a mass fraction range of the target analyte from 2. 5 to 300 mg kg– 1. The following method performance characteristics were obtained: the recovery rate varied from 82 % to 129 % and precision expressed as the relative standard deviation of intermediate precision varied from 1. 6 % to 15 %. Based on the acceptable performance obtained in the validation study, the <b>multi-analyte</b> <b>method</b> is considered fit for the intended purpose. JRC. F. 5 -Food and Feed Complianc...|$|E

Target analysis of low concentrations of 25 μg/kg of dexamethasone in feed can be performed by combining immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) and LC with UV detection. A straightforward multi-analyte procedure is obtained by tandem solid-phase extraction (SPE) and subsequent LC-UV. However, the limits of detection for feed samples are then relatively poor, viz. 100 μg/kg.

40|$|Sample {{preparation}} {{is critical in}} relation to analysis time, sample throughput and therefore analysis costs. Due to recent advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) instrumentation, the detection of many compounds within one run became possible, and methods for the simultaneous analysis of different compound groups were developed. To be able to analyze compounds with different {{physical and chemical properties}} simultaneously, generic, non-selective sample-preparation procedures are applied. The most frequently reported generic sample-preparation methods are a solvent extraction only, solid-phase extraction and a Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) approach. These <b>multi-analyte</b> <b>methods</b> – sometimes including more than 150 different compounds – are of much interest for analytical laboratories due to their reduction in costs. A clear drawback of generic sample-preparation procedures is the occurrence of abundant matrix effects, which compromise detection limits, quantitative aspects, method selectivity and maintenance frequency. In contrast to the trend towards non-selective sample preparation, an opposite trend towards more selective sample-preparation methods is expected to be able to confirm the identity of compounds unambiguously (e. g., stereoisomers).

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>multi-analyte</b> <b>methods</b> for lipophilic shellfish toxins based on liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry permits rapid screening {{and analysis of}} samples {{for a wide variety}} of toxins in a single run. To ensure accuracy of results, validated methods and appropriate certified reference materials (CRMs) are required. CRMs are essential for accurate instrument calibration, for assessing the complete analytical method from sample extraction to data analysis, and for verifying trueness. However, CRMs have hitherto only been available for single toxin groups. Production of a CRM containing six major toxin groups was achieved through an international collaboration. Preparation of this material, CRM-FDMT 1, drew on information from earlier studies as well as improved methods for handling bulk tissues, production of reference materials, and isolation of toxins. Previous investigations of stabilisation techniques indicated freeze-drying to be a suitable procedure for preparation of shellfish toxin RMs and applicable to a wide range of toxins. CRM-FDMT 1 was initially prepared as a bulk wet tissue homogenate with planned concentrations of domoic acid, okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins, azaspiracids, pectenotoxins, yessotoxin and spirolides. The homogenate was then freeze dried, milled and bottled in aliquots suitable for distribution and analysis. The moisture content and particle size distribution were measured, and determined to be appropriate. A preliminary toxin analysis of the final material showed a comprehensive toxin profile.

Matrix induced signal suppression/enhancement was studied in detail and varied significantly between the investigated matrices as well as between individual samples (relative standard deviation was as high as 40 % within three rice varieties) and individual toxins.

We focused on a sample preparation able to extract the different classes of NPS. About 30 mg of hair was decontaminated and incubated overnight under sonication in different conditions {{depending on the type of}} analytes to be extracted: (a) with 300 μL of HCOOH 0. 1 % for cathinones, piperazines and ATS; (b) with 300 μL of MeOH for synthetic cannabinoids.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. November 2014. Major: Comparative and Molecular Biosciences. Advisors: Rebecca Davies, Michael Murtaugh. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 135 pages. Because {{of the complexity}} of the cytokine network, an individual cytokine measurement may be difficult to interpret or may provide insufficient information to inform conclusions. Multiplexing technology, which allows for the simultaneous measurement of multiple analytes, has advanced the study of cytokine secretion patterns. However, if cytokines are to be measured and used to make conclusions on research studies, we must understand the variability around the measurement and the potential for errors associated with testing. Method validation procedures generate data that reflect assay performance and identify the inherent measurement uncertainty, allowing data to be accurately interpreted. This study included the design and performance of a multiplex assay validation assessment for the simultaneous measurement of 23 cytokines in non-human primate (NHP) serum. The validation included analysis of serum samples from 36 healthy cynomolgus macaques in order to determine if the method could be used to detect cytokine concentrations in healthy NHP. Although sensitivity and precision data were generally acceptable, recovery and linearity data were highly variable. Of the 23 cytokines tested, 11 met acceptance criteria, 5 were marginal and 7 were rejected. The ability of the method to detect cytokine concentrations was demonstrated and cytokine concentration ranges were presented for 15 cytokines as measured in serum from healthy cynomolgus macaques. If the validation studies had not been performed, false conclusions could be made (overestimated or underestimated cytokine values) contributing to errors within the Total Testing Process. It would be appropriate to continue to evaluate the impact of pre-analytical error (e. g. storage time and temperature, blood collection steps) on the measurement of cytokines in serum from cynomolgus macaques. Because this work demonstrates significant variability among measurements within and between animals, other important next steps include the description of typical variation levels within and between animals, followed by the generation of appropriate (population- or subject-based) reference intervals for healthy animals. It is clear after performing this validation study, that clinical and research investment in <b>multi-analyte</b> <b>methods</b> is not warranted without demonstration of method validity for each analyte of interest...|$|R

The proposed method allows the screening of several classes of substance in a single chromatographic method with a run-time of 11 min, inclusive of post-run and reconditioning times. Chromatographic separation is achieved in 7. 2 min using a reversed-phase 2. 7 mu m fused-core particle column, generating a back-pressure not exceeding 400 bar and therefore enabling the use of traditional high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instruments. The effectiveness of this approach was evaluated, by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in positive electrospray ionization, using 20 blank urine samples spiked with 45 compounds prohibited in sport: 11 diuretics, 16 glucocorticoids, 9 stimulants, 5 anti-oestrogens, as well as formoterol, carboxy-finasteride (previously prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in 2008), gestrinone and tetrahydrogestrinone. Qualitative validation shows the proposed method to be specific with no significant interference. All of the analytes considered in this study were clearly distinguishable in urine, with limits of detection ranging from 5 ng/mL to 350 ng/mL, significantly below the Minimum Required Performance Levels (MRPL) set by WADA for the accredited sports anti-doping laboratories.

Currently developed multi-analyte rapid immunoassays provide convenient and rapid qualitative and quantitative assays. However, these test formats cannot achieve high-throughput measurements. Multiplexed antibody microarrays in planar and on microspheres in suspension are also common multi-analyte immunoassay formats. They support relatively more analyte detection than a single assay. However, these types of immunoassays are mainly based on fluorescence, chemiluminescence and electrochemical methods which are relatively complicated to handle, time consuming and heavily reliant imaging systems and analyzers for signal quantification. These test formats do not provide an instant naked eye observable signal so they {{are not able to}} provide a qualitative measurement for convenient use. In view of this, a multiplexed antibody microarray for qualitative and quantitative detection of multi-analytes was developed.

The corresponding maximum levels have been recently introduced by European legislation. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats from the feed samples followed by centrifugation and filtration of the supernatants for all matrices. For calf feed an additional de-fattening step of the filtrated supernatants with n-hexane was necessary. The resulting supernatants were submitted to chromatographic analysis. The analytes were quantified by a modified approach of the standard additions technique applied to the extracts, hence allowing a workload comparable to matrix-matched standard calibration curves. A further simplification of this technique was reached by applying the same addition levels of the target analytes for different concentration ranging from 0. 5 × maximum level up to 2. 5 × maximum level (universal approach). The concentration independent intermediate precision {{expressed in terms of}} relative standard deviation varied between 3 and 12 % (except for maduramicin ammonium alpha and semduramicin sodium up to 21 %) and the recovery rates ranged from 80 to 111 %, depending on the target analyte and matrix.

Good regression coefficients of the calibration curves in a range of 0. 992 - 0. 999 and reproducibilities in a range of 2. 3 - 15 % were obtained. LODs were in the range of 0. 03 - 1. 4 µg/L and recoveries were in a range of 21 - 110 % for all the amines. A total of 93 coloured paper napkin samples from different European countries were bought and extracted with water to determine the PAAs. The results showed that, 42 out of 93 samples contained at least one PAA. More than half of the detected PAAs are considered as toxic, carcinogenic or probably carcinogenic to humans by the IARC, or are classified as such in the European Union legislation on chemicals. Summed concentrations of PAAs in 7 samples were higher than 10 µg/L, the limit of summed PAA in the EU plastic food contact material Regulation. Also, 8 PAAs classified as Category 1 A and 1 B carcinogen in the EU legislation of chemicals, were detected at concentrations higher than 2 µg/L, exceeding the limit proposed by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany. Aniline (n= 14) was most frequently present in higher concentrations followed by o-Toluidine, o-Anisidine, 2, 4 -Dimethylaniline and 4 -Aminoazobenzene. Red, orange, yellow and multi-coloured paper napkins contained the highest concentrations of total PAAs (> 10 µg/L). Although the European Union has not harmonized the legislation of paper and board materials and thus there is no specific migration limit for PAAs from paper napkins, the present study showed that coloured paper napkins can contain toxic and carcinogenic PAAs at concentrations that are relevant for monitoring.

The concentration level of the target analytes at which the validation experiments {{have been carried out}} varied between 1 and 9 mg kg. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats from the feed samples followed by a clean-up by solid-phase extraction prior to chromatographic analysis. The analytes were quantified either by matrix matched standards or by the standard addition technique, obtaining the following performance profile of the method for the various analyte/matrix combinations. When quantifying against matrix matched standards, the concentration independent intermediate precision expressed in terms of relative percentage standard deviation varied between 4 and 10 % and the relative percentage recovery rates ranged from 87 to 120 % depending on the target analyte and matrix. When using the standard addition technique, the corresponding values for the intermediate precision varied between 2 and 8 % and the relative percentage recovery rate ranged from 73 to 115 %. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were different for the various analyte/matrix combinations but were in all cases below 0. 014 mg kg and 0. 046 mg kg respectively. Based on the obtained method performance characteristics, the method is considered suitable for {{the determination of}} ionophore coccidiostats in target feed. The main field of application of the validated method is to enforce European legislation regarding the authorisation of coccidiostats, focusing on the measurement at the authorised levels and at low level in feed during the withdrawal period at which the coccidiostats must not be added to the feed. Overall, the method proposed appears to be appropriate as a confirmatory method for the monitoring of these six ionophore coccidiostats and can therefore be considered as complimentary to the official PHLC-UV methods.

40|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} {{mass spectrometry}} (LC-MS) {{is a powerful}} analytical tool for <b>multi-analyte</b> quantification. This <b>method</b> can be combined with microdialysis sampling to study small molecules and neuropeptides within discrete brain regions. This thesis focuses {{on the development of}} targeted LC-MS assays to analyze dialysate samples collected from awake animals to correlate neurochemical dynamics with behavior. Previous LC-MS assays used benzoyl chloride derivatization to enable quantification of 17 neurotransmitters and metabolites in dialysate samples. In this work, derivatization conditions were modified to improve sensitivity up to 25 -fold and reduce complexity of the procedure. The assay was also expanded to 70 compounds including amino acids, polyamines (e. g., putrescine, spermidine, spermine), compounds from catecholamine biosynthesis pathways (e. g., tyrosine and tryptophan metabolic pathways), and trace amines (e. g., tyramine, octopamine, synephrine). Besides measurements in dialysate, the method was able to analyze plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples. This work improves the utility of benzoyl chloride, which labels multiple important functional groups, for widely targeted metabolomics methods. Neuropeptides constitute the largest group of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Neuropeptide signaling is involved in many physiological functions but detection in vivo is challenging due to low picomolar concentrations. Targeted capillary LC-MS methods were developed for neurotensin, oxytocin, dynorphin, and enkephalins. The assays utilize desalting and preconcentration on a single analytical column to achieve low picomolar limits of detection. Detection was improved by optimizing all facets of neuropeptide handling from sampling to detection with capillary LC-MS. These techniques were applied to examine several aspects of neuronal function. Specific neuronal circuits were defined, confirmed, and targeted by combining these analytical tools with pharmacogenetic and optogenetic methods. Novel pathophysiological changes to opioid neuropeptide (dynorphin and enkephalins) dynamics were elucidated in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease, and a potential neuropeptide-based treatment was established to reduce the abnormal dyskinetic movements associated with chronic dopamine replacement therapies in Parkinson’s Disease. These new multiplexed approaches will advance our understanding of the complex processes underlying neuronal function at the molecular and circuit levels, as well as provides an improved set of experimental tools to better understand lingering questions in the field of neuroscience...|$|R
40|$|Food {{safety is}} an {{increasing}} health concern, recognised and promoted by many institutions across the globe. Food products can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms, environmental pollutants, veterinary drug residues, allergens and toxins. Public health concerns which have been raised in relation to hazardous agents found in food include, among others, increased cancer risk, endocrine, reproductive and neurobehavioral systems disruption, teratogenesis, antibiotic resistance and even death in cases of allergic reactions and acute poisoning. Some of the food hazardous agents (e. g. pathogenic microorganisms and toxins) can even be used as biological warfare, spread through food and agricultural chains. Thus, an adequate detection of these compounds is also important for biosecurity. In order to safeguard consumers’ health, legislations {{have been put in}} place both in the US and the EU. These laws specify for each health threatening compound the maximal acceptable amounts in different food products. Besides health issues, food safety and quality has an economical impact on the food industry, where quality control expenses amount to about 1. 5 – 2 % of the total sales. Since more and more food products nowadays contain multiple and processed ingredients, which are often shipped from different parts of the world, and share common production lines and storage spaces, food safety and quality monitoring becomes a challenging task. Traditional analytical methods require dedicated laboratories, equipment and highly trained personnel for detection and identification of each type of hazardous agent (e. g. antibiotics, bacteria, allergens). These techniques are also time-consuming and often expensive. There is a growing need for <b>multi-analyte</b> screening <b>methods,</b> which will enable rapid and simultaneous detection of multiple compounds in complex food samples. In recent years, biosensors have been applied successfully to food analysis, incorporating the same bioassay principals as traditional methods with transducers (optical, electrochemical, etc) in novel, usually miniaturized, integrated analytical devices. However, most of these biosensors still lack the desired level of the multiplexicity. Recent developments in the field of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technology in the direction of high-throughput systems and multi-analyte measurements present a promising alternative for the existing systems. One of such systems is imaging SPR (iSPR); it enables real-time and label free read-out of spatially modified surfaces (e. g. microarrays). The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an iSPR–based biosensor, for simultaneous and quantitative detection of different health-threatening compounds in food. To obtain a comprehensive overview on the analytical applicability of such a system, several points were addressed. The intrinsic sensor properties, such as optical sensitivity and robustness, of the iSPR instrument were studied. Further on, both direct and competitive immunoassay formats for high and low molecular weight compounds detection using the iSPR platform were evaluated. Then, the iSPR-based biosensor was applied for detection of regulated substances in food such as antibiotic residues in milk and allergens in cookies and chocolates. Finally, the most common drawback of using SPR for screening in complex biological matrices, the nonspecific binding to the sensor chip surface, was tackled. The sensitivity of both high and low molecular weight compounds was proven to be sufficient for some of the hazardous agents detection at the maximum residue levels, established in the EU legislation, as was demonstrated by simultaneous detection of seven antibiotic residues in milk and twelve allergens in cookies and dark chocolates. The analysis time takes about 10 minutes and provides quantitative information on multiple targets, producing a fingerprint (allergenic fingerprint for instance) of the tested food. This detailed food profile contributes to the decision making process on the quality and safety of foods, basing it on the total picture of all target compounds present. In order for iSPR-based biosensing to reach its full potential and to become a widely applied routine analytical tool, the instrumental cost needs to be reduced and the analysis further simplified, becoming cost-effective and approachable to non-trained personnel. An additional drawback in analytical applications of a SPR sensor is the nonspecific binding of the matrix components of complex samples to the sensor surface. Many assays based on SPR fail due to inapplicability to measure in “real” samples. As a possible solution to this problem, sensor chip surface engineering was suggested in this thesis. A nanopatterned filter layer covering the sensor chip surface was found to be effective in reducing nonspecific binding when the measurements were performed in “raw” samples by keeping the non-soluble aggregates and big sample matrix components beyond the sensing region of the SPR. With respect to other existing biosensors, iSPR still lags behind in terms of sensitivity and portability. In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that iSPR-based biosensor is a versatile platform, which can be applied for a wide variety of fundamentally different analytes and offers several advantages over already existing methods. SPR detection principle eliminates the need in labelling and the instrumental set-up allows automated analysis. High multiplexing capabilities and short measurement times are obtained with no need for complex and time consuming sample preparation steps. By using iSPR-based biosensor, one can obtain robust and quantitative information on the target analyte concentration, in real time and with high specificity (or broad spectrum, depending on the assay). In conclusion, on-chip screening using iSPR, described here, presents a powerful analytical approach towards food safety and quality monitoring which satisfies the current need in rapid and multi-analytical devices...|$|R
