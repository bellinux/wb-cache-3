40|$|Recent roof {{failures}} in South Africa, of <b>multiple</b> <b>ply</b> nail plated trusses, have necessitated a rethink {{about the way}} in which timber trusses are analysed. The authors believe that the relative slip between plies caused by a torsional moment as a result of eccentric loading is a possible reason for some of the failures. The design assumption in South Africa and America is that all the plies share the applied load equally; Eurocode 5 (BS EN 1995 - 1 - 1 : 2004) does not cover the design of <b>multiple</b> <b>ply</b> trusses; and BS 5268 - 3 : 2006 recommends additional load factors to be applied to eccentrically loaded truss components with the outer ply being loaded more than the inner plies, {{as a result of the}} torsion induced by an out-of-plane eccentricity. In this paper, a matrix stiffness method is used to show that, by ignoring the eccentric loading and relative slip between the trusses, the member and plate force may be underestimated by a factor in excess of two for a three ply girder truss. A single three-ply girder truss test is used to illustrate the merits of the method. The required load factors calculated also show that the magnification factors in BS 5268 - 3 : 2006 are lower than they should be. [URL]...|$|R

A reliable prediction of the forming process requires an accurate description of the bending behavior. To this end, a characterization method for the bending of composites under thermoforming conditions has been developed. Experiments are performed with an in-house developed bending setup and are analyzed with an analytical model, which is derived in this paper.

Comparisons are made between the structural response of the new extension-shearing and bending-twisting coupled laminates and others possessing both extension-shearing coupling only or bending-twisting coupling only, which typically arise in un-balanced and symmetric or balanced and symmetric designs, respectively. These comparisons involve the buckling interaction of infinitely long plates, which serve to isolate the effects of each form of coupling behaviour and highlight the detrimental effects of bending-twisting coupling on compression buckling strength as well as the beneficial effects on shear buckling strength.

50|$|The {{heads or}} skins used are a batter head (the playing surface {{on the top}} of the drum) and a {{resonant}} (bottom) head. The resonant head is usually much thinner than the batter head and is not beaten while playing. Rather than calfskin, most modern drums use plastic (Mylar) skins of around 10 mils thickness, sometimes with <b>multiple</b> <b>plies</b> (usually two) of around 7 mils for the batter head. In addition, tone control rings or dots can be applied, either on the outer or inner surface of the head, to control overtones and ringing, and can be found positioned in the centre or close to the edge hoops or both. Resonant heads are usually only a few mils thick, to enable them to respond to the movement of the batter head as it is played. Pipe band requirements have led to the development of a Kevlar-based head, enabling very high tuning, thus producing a very high-pitched cracking snare sound.|$|R

40|$|New {{generation}} {{non-crimp fabric}} (NCF) offers an attractive thin and lightweight building block alternative {{in the design}} of composite materials and structures. Pre-assembly of <b>multiple</b> <b>plies</b> of parallel fibers, each laying in a different orientation would not require crimping of the fibers and would enable one-axis lay-up that can substantially reduce the labor, scrap, and manufacturing costs. A state-of-the-art tow-spreading technique enables ply thickness to be reduced to as low as one-third of the typical commercial high quality pre-preg ply thickness. The thin-ply NCF stacks result in well-dispersed plies of different fiber orientations and creates the so-called homogenized laminates without ply clustering. As an option, bi-angle thin-ply NCF offers two different fiber orientations with one being off-axis, e. g. at φ°, along with an on-axis 0 ° forming (0 /φ) assembly. This allows to design in anisotropic properties within the NCF building block. An overview of several aspects of the thin-ply bi-angle NCF composites is provided to address associated benefits and opportunities in the lightweight structural composites design process...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{composite}} materials for repair and retrofit of structures {{has become a}} common use among the engineering community. Fabric Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) is a composite material specifically designed for masonry and concrete rehabilitation and is becoming {{a viable alternative to}} FRP, whenever the project conditions do not allow the use of organic polymer based composites. FRCM is usually constituted by one or <b>multiple</b> <b>plies</b> of dry fabrics (carbon, glass, aramid, basalt or PBO fibers) embedded into an inorganic matrix. If a polymer is used to either cover or bond the fabric strands, such polymer does not fully penetrate and impregnate the fibers as it would for FRP. The purpose of this research work is to study how different types and amounts of organic coatings applied to a carbon fabric could affect the bond behavior between fabric and mortar. The effectiveness of coating treatments was studied by means of direct tensile, pull-off and shear-bond double-lap tests. Experimentation was carried out on different combinations of fabrics and mortars, by varying the levels of pre-impregnation of the fabric during its manufacturing. In addition, the use of a quartz sand layer applied to the fabric after impregnation was investigated.

The zinc chloride used in making vulcanized fibre swelled and gelatinized the cellulose. The fibre swelling explains why paper filters cannot be used to filter zinc chloride solutions.

40|$|Advanced {{composites}} can be fabricated by laminating <b>multiple</b> <b>plies</b> {{into the}} desired shape, and then cured in an autoclave with simultaneous application of proper heat and pressure. The {{knowledge of the}} cure process {{is very important in}} order to obtain fully cured and high-quality composites. In-situ sensors capable of monitoring the change of physical and chemical properties during the cure process are therefore desirable. The major aspects of research in this thesis are as follows: The chemical kinetic and rheological properties of AS 4 / 3501 - 6 Graphite/Epoxy composites are characterized by using Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer. This indicates that at 176 C̕, the cure reaction is almost fully completed after 60 minutes, and increasing cure temperature results in a noticeable decrease in loss tan 6 and a profound increase in the Tg. Ultrasonic characterization shows that the moduli of 3501 - 6 epoxy increase with increasing cure temperature, whereas the moduli of AS 4 / 3501 - 6 composite reach their maximum around 176 C̕. Also, the moduli of the composite increase with increasing cure time, whereas the moduli of the epoxy, after being cured at 176 C̕ for 80 minutes, exhibit no change. A state-of-the-art fiber-optic and ultrasonic cure processing monitoring system is developed, which consists of ultrasonic transducers with clad buffer rods, Extrinsic Fabry-Perot Interferometric fiber-optic sensors, and a special autoclave feedthrough. This system is workable in an autoclave at high temperature and gas pressure, has high ultrasonic signal to spurious noise ratio, and is suited for longitudinal and/or shear wave measurement. The development of properties of the curing AS 4 / 3501 - 6 composite is monitored by using in-situ fiber-optic and/or ultrasonic sensors, indicating that (1) both sensors can sense the gelation period; (2) the ultrasonic sensor is able to determine the end-of-cure, while the fiber-optic sensor is not; (3) during the cool-down period the development of thermal mismatch strains between the mold plates and the composite panel, prior to and after the detachment, can be detected by the fiber-optic sensor...|$|R
