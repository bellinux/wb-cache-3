40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} are: • to {{identify}} the different ways used by Italian listed company in preparing <b>management</b> <b>report</b> • to investigate their possible relation to firm characteristics. In order to achieve the first aim, the contents of 99 <b>management</b> <b>reports</b> of Italian listed companies and the words dedicated to them were identified. Based on the above elements, <b>management</b> <b>reports</b> were clustered in three groups {{that seem to be}} based on the following strategies of disclosure: ‘not to inform’, ‘to inform only if mandatory’, and ‘to communicate’. In order to achieve the second aim, the characteristics of the companies relating to the three <b>management</b> <b>report</b> groups were compared. Afterwards, multiple linear regression analyses were performed to identify the influence of firm characteristics on the specific aspects concerning the ways used in preparing <b>management</b> <b>reports.</b> Firm size, parent company relationships as well as industry seem to have significant influence...|$|R

25|$|In {{jurisdictional}} strikes, outlawed by Taft–Hartley, a union {{strikes in}} order to assign particular work to the employees it represents. Secondary boycotts and common situs picketing, also outlawed by the act, are actions in which unions picket, strike, or refuse to handle the goods of a business with which they have no primary dispute but which {{is associated with a}} targeted business. A later statute, the Labor <b>Management</b> <b>Reporting</b> and Disclosure Act, passed in 1959, tightened these restrictions on secondary boycotts still further.|$|E
25|$|A {{contract}} of employment can always create better terms than statutory minimum rights. But to increase their bargaining power to get fair terms, employees organize labor unions for collective bargaining. The Clayton Act of 1914 guarantees all people the right to organize, and the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 creates rights for most employees to organize without detriment through unfair labor practices. Under the Labor <b>Management</b> <b>Reporting</b> and Disclosure Act of 1959, labor union governance follows democratic principles. If a majority of employees in a workplace support a union, employing entities {{have a duty to}} bargain in good faith. Unions can take collective action to defend their interests, including withdrawing their labor on strike. There are not yet general rights to directly participate in enterprise governance, but many employees and unions have experimented with securing representation on corporate boards.|$|E

25|$|While union {{governance}} {{is founded}} upon freedom of association, {{the law requires}} basic standards democracy and accountability to ensure members are truly free in shaping their associations. Fundamentally, all unions are democratic organizations, but they divide between those where members elect delegates, who in turn choose the executive, and those where members directly elect the executive. In 1957, after the McClellan Committee of the US Senate found evidence of two rival Teamsters Union executives, Jimmy Hoffa and Dave Beck, falsifying delegate vote counts and stealing union funds, Congress passed the Labor <b>Management</b> <b>Reporting</b> and Disclosure Act of 1959. Under §411, every member {{has the right to}} vote, attend meetings, speak freely and organize, not have fees raised without a vote, not be deprived of the right to sue, or be suspended unjustly. Under §431, unions should file their constitutions and bylaws with the Secretary of Labor and be accessible by members: today union constitutions are online. Under §481 elections must occur at least every 5 years, and local officers every 3 years, by secret ballot. Additionally, state law may bar union officials who have prior convictions for felonies from holding office. As a response to the Hoffa and Beck scandals, there is also an express fiduciary duty on union officers for members' money, limits on loans to executives, requirements for bonds for handling money, and up to a $10,000 fine or up to 5 years prison for embezzlement. These rules, however, restated most of what was already the law, and codified principles of governance that unions already undertook. On the other hand, under §501(b) to bring a lawsuit, a union member must first make a demand on the executive to correct wrongdoing before any claim can be made to a court, even for misapplication of funds, and potentially wait four months' time. The Supreme Court has held that union members can intervene in enforcement proceedings brought by the US Department of Labor. Federal courts may review decisions by the Department to proceed with any prosecutions. The range of rights, and the level of enforcement has meant that labor unions display significantly higher standards of accountability, with fewer scandals, than corporations or financial institutions.|$|E

Section 504(a) of the Landrum-Griffin Act explicitly barred from {{office for a}} five-year period union officers convicted of any number of crimes. [...] By enacting Section 504(a), O'Connor concluded, Congress [...] "unmistakably indicated that the right of employees to select the officers of their bargaining representatives is not absolute..." [...] Citing the plurality opinion in De Veau v. Braisted, 363 U.S. 144 (1960), O'Connor noted that the Court had previously held that the Landrum-Griffin Act had not preempted the role of state legislation in regulating union officials.|$|E
30|$|We set the {{analysis}} period from 2002 to 2008, {{in order to}} capture a multi-year perspective for the investigation of voluntary strategy disclosures. We did not expand {{the analysis}} period beyond 2008 because <b>management</b> <b>reports</b> for the period 2009 to 2010 are neither appropriate for analysis nor comparable to <b>management</b> <b>reports</b> for the years from 2002 to 2008 due to the global economic and financial crisis. Our cross-sectional design thus resulted in 700 firm-year observations. We collected all <b>management</b> <b>reports</b> either by downloading official versions from corporate websites or by requesting hard copies from investor relations managers.|$|R

2500|$|De Veau v. Braisted, 363 U.S. 144 (1960), is a 5-to-3 {{ruling by}} the Supreme Court of the United States that an interstate compact restricting convicted felons from holding union office is not preempted by the National Labor Relations Act or the Labor <b>Management</b> <b>Reporting</b> and Disclosure Act, does not violate the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, and is not an ex post facto law or bill of {{attainder}} in violation of [...] of the Constitution.|$|E
2500|$|However, in {{the post-war}} period it once more blasted unions {{and the federal}} government's labor policies.

2500|$|De Veau had further {{argued that}} the passage in 1959 of the Labor <b>Management</b> <b>Reporting</b> and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) also preempted the interstate compact. Title V of the LMRDA {{specifically}} imposed restrictions on union officers, clearly preempting any state action in this area, De Veau said. [...] The majority disagreed. [...] Passage of Title V of the LMRDA, Frankfurter wrote, shows just the opposite—that Congress did not find state restrictions {{on the right to}} hold union office incompatible with pre-1959 federal labor policies. Furthermore, Frunkfurter interpreted Section 504(a) and Section 603(a) of the LMRDA as specifically disclaiming of preemption of state laws regulating union officials (which only a few, limited, express exceptions).|$|E
