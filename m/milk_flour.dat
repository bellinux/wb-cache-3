Commercial products are described and a list of main factories producing and distributing them (until 1965) is included. Product composition shows a high level of variability, mainly due to the quick evolution in the use of different ingredients (increase of soluble carbohydrates and blended flours, fortification with minerals and vitamins, etc.). Ingredients and composition were changing along the years according to the increasing knowledge in nutrition sciences and food technology. Regarding the factories producing <b>milked</b> <b>flours,</b> we can observe a concentration trend during 20 ’s and 30 ’s. In contrast, in further decades new producers appeared in the market {{and some of them are}} still actives at this moment. </p...|$|R

40|$|An all-solid-state {{potentiometric}} electronic tongue with 36 polymeric membranes {{has been}} used {{for the first time to}} detect gliadins, which are primarily responsible for gluten intolerance in people suffering from celiac disease. A linear discriminant model, based on the signals of 11 polymeric membranes, selected from the 36 above using a stepwise procedure, was used to semi-quantitatively classify samples of a “Gluten-free” foodstuff (baby <b>milked</b> <b>flour),</b> previously contaminated with known amounts of gliadins (50 mg/kg), as “Gluten-free”, “Low-Gluten content” or “Gluten-containing”. For this food matrix, the device had sensitivity towards gliadins of 1 – 2 mg/kg and overall sensitivity and specificity of 77 % and 78 %, respectively. Moreover, the device never identified an ethanolic extract containing gliadins as “Gluten-free”. Finally, the system also allowed distinguishing “Gluten-free” and “Gluten-containing” foodstuffs (15 foods, including breads, <b>flours,</b> baby <b>milked</b> <b>flours,</b> cookies and breakfast cereals) with an overall sensitivity and specificity greater than 83 %, using the signals of only 4 selected polymeric membranes (selected using a stepwise procedure). Since only one “Gluten-containing” foodstuff was misclassified as “Gluten-free”, the device could be used as a preliminary tool for quality control of foods for celiac patients.

50|$|Rich brioche-like breads (often braided) {{are known}} by various Greek names that {{represent}} three major holidays for Greeks: Easter, Christmas and New Year's. There are many local varieties of these festive breads, based on <b>milk,</b> <b>flour,</b> eggs, sugar, yeast, butter, and a flavoring {{which can be}} mahleb, Chian mastic. The butter is added after kneading: the dough is stretched, brushed with melted butter, folded and stretched again repeatedly, until all the butter is incorporated.
