50|$|<b>Marteilia</b> <b>refringens</b> is a {{unicellular}} parasite {{affecting the}} digestive {{system of the}} flat oyster, Ostrea edulis. Other species that can be infected include the Australian mud oyster (O. angasi), the Argentinean oyster (O. puelchana), the Chilean flat oyster (O. chilensis), the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the Mediterranean mussel (M. galloprovincialis). Early stages {{of the life cycle}} occur in the epithelia of the digestive ducts and possibly the gills of the host. Later the parasite migrates to the epithelial cells of the digestive tubules. There may be no symptoms of infection. The factors triggering a pathogenic response are unclear but may be related to environmental stress. The gross signs of marteiliosis include the visceral tissues losing their pigmentation and becoming pale yellow. In some cases the mantle become translucent and shell growth may cease. Affected shellfish can become emaciated and in heavy infections tissues appear shrunken and slimy. Mortality seems {{to be related to the}} sporulation of the parasite. The parasite was first observed in France in 1979 and has since spread to other countries in Europe.|$|E
40|$|Since {{its first}} description, the paramyxean {{parasite}} <b>Marteilia</b> <b>refringens</b> {{has been recognized}} as a significant pathogen of bivalve mollusks.

40|$|<b>Marteilia</b> <b>refringens</b> is {{recognized}} as one of the most significant pathogens of bivalve molluscs. The nucleotide sequence of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene of <b>Marteilia</b> <b>refringens</b> is used to elucidate the phylogenetic position of the phylum Paramyxea. Genomic DNA was extracted from sporangia of Marteilia, purified from infected blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, and flat oysters, Ostrea edulis. The sequences obtained from Marteilia species purified from both oysters and mussels were identical. The sequence identity was confirmed by in situ hybridization using a DNA probe targeted to a variable region of the ribosomal DNA. The small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequence of M. refringens is very different from all known sequences of eukaryotic organisms, including those of myxosporeans and haplosporeans. Therefore, the phylum Paramyxea should continue to be recognized as an independent eukaryotic phylum.

Transmission of the infection from infected bivalves to copepodsParacartia grani could be experimentally achieved but assays from copepods to bivalves failed. In order {{to contribute to}} the elucidation of the M. refringens life cycle, the dynamics of the infection was investigated in O. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and zooplankton over one year in Diana lagoon, Corsica (France). Flat oysters appeared non-infected while mussels were infected part of the year, showing highest prevalence in summertime. The parasite was detected by PCR in zooplankton particularly after the peak of prevalence in mussels. Several zooplanktonic groups including copepods, Cladocera, Appendicularia, Chaetognatha and Polychaeta appeared PCR positive. However, only the copepod species Paracartia latisetosa showed positive signal by in situ hybridization.

40|$|Species {{belonging}} to the genus Marteilia are protozoan parasites of bivalves. The species <b>Marteilia</b> <b>refringens,</b> jeopardizing the health of European bivalves, is included {{on the list of}} OIE notifiable pathogens. Two genotypes of <b>Marteilia</b> <b>refringens</b> are distinguished: type “O” affecting mainly oysters, and type “M” affecting mainly mussels. Historically, detection of Marteilia species is primarily carried out by histology. In recent years molecular assays are more frequently used for the detection of mollusc pathogens, also in routine monitoring. In the present work, a competitive real-time PCR assay was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of M. refringens and discrimination between “M” and “O” genotypes of M. refringens. The real-time PCR assay was shown to be analytically sensitive and specific and has a high repeatability and efficiency. Subsequent application of the assay on collected bivalves from two geographical locations, the Ebro Delta in Mediterranean Spain and the Rhine-Meuse Delta in the Netherlands resulted in detection of M. refringens type M in Mytilus galloprovincialis and M. refringens type O in Ostrea edulis from Spain. In two O. edulis specimen both M. refringens type O and type M were detected. In the Netherlands M. refringens was not observed in any of the tested Mytilus edulis and O. edulis. The results obtained by real time PCR were in correspondence with the results obtained by histopathology and a substantial agreement with the results obtained by conventional PCR. In conclusion, the developed real time PCR assay facilitates rapid detection and subtyping of M. refringens and could be applied for further studies on epidemiology of the parasite, geographical distribution and host specificity...|$|E
40|$|The {{flat oyster}} Ostrea edulis is the species endemic from European coasts, Atlantic and Mediterranean. It has been {{exploited}} since Roman times in Europe.

40|$|<b>Marteilia</b> <b>refringens</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} pathogens of bivalve molluscs. Previous sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene of M. refringens isolates derived from the infected mussels (Mytilus edulis and Mytilus galloprovinciallis) and the oyster (Ostrea edulis) in Europe did not reveal genetic polymorphisms despite indications from epizootiological data that distinct types may exist. We investigated the existence of polymorphisms in the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal RNA genes. The sequences of this region proved to be clearly dimorphic among Marteilia from five sampling sites. The distribution of the two genetic types, named "O" and "M", appeared to be linked to the host species, oysters and mussels, respectively. We therefore support the recognition of two species of Marteilia in Europe and propose that the "O" type corresponds to M. refringens and the "M" type to M. maurini. Source type: Electronic(1...|$|E

40|$|<b>Marteilia</b> <b>refringens</b> {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} of the European flat oyster, Ostrea edulis Linnaeus. Since its description, the life-cycle of this protozoan parasite has eluded discovery. Attempts {{to infect}} oysters experimentally have been unsuccessful {{and led to the}} hypothesis of a complex life-cycle involving several hosts. Knowledge of this life-cycle is of central importance in order to manage oyster disease. However, the exploration of M. refringens life-cycle has been previously limited by the detection tools available and the tremendous number of species to be screened in enzootic areas. In this study, these two restrictions were circumvented by the use of both molecular detection tools and a mesocosm with low biodiversity. Screening of the entire fauna of the pond for M. refringens DNA was systematically undertaken using PCR. Here, we show that the copepod Paracartia (Acartia) grani is a host of M. refringens.

However, this screening remains impeded by the number of species living in the vicinity of oyster beds. We report here on the use of semi-closed oyster ponds (so called 'claire' in Marennes-Oleron Bay) as a study model for the life-cycle of M. refringens.

40|$|The {{protozoan}} parasite <b>Marteilia</b> <b>refringens</b> {{has been}} {{partly responsible for}} the severe decrease in the production of the European flat oyster Ostrea edulis Linnaeus in France since the 1970 s. The calanoid copepod Paracartia grani Sars was recently found to be a host for M. refringens in French shallow-water oyster ponds ('claires'). This study reconsidered M. refringens transmission dynamics in the light of this finding, taking into account not only oyster infection dynamics and environmental factors but also data concerning the copepod host. P. grani population dynamics in the claire under study revealed that this species is the dominant planktonic copepod in this confined ecosystem. During winter, M. refringens overwintered in O. edulis, with P. grani existing only as resting eggs in the sediment. The increase in temperature in spring controlled and synchronized both the release of M. refringens sporangia in the oyster feces, and the hatching of the benthic resting eggs of the copepod. Infection of oysters by M. refringens was limited to June, July and August, coinciding with (1) the highest temperature recorded in the claire, and (2) the highest abundance of P. grani. PCR detection of M. refringens in P. grani during the summer period was linked to the release of parasite sporangia by the oyster.

Common parasites including regionally problematic <b>Marteilia</b> <b>refringens</b> were observed in the specimen. We found the Ciliophora-like Protozoan group in digestive diverticula (43. 33 % of hosts). Steinhausia mytilovum is observed in oocytes of the host, and its prevalence was up to 32 %. The presence and absence of the Ciliophora-like group had a significant relationship with variation of salinity in the site (p< 0. 05), and the presence and absence of the S. mytilovum had a significant relationship with change in the gonadic index (p< 0. 05). The negative impact of parasites upon the local population of M. galloprovincialis at the site was not major during the surveyed years. No mortality due to the parasitic diseases has been observed in mussels in Mâ€™diq.

The objective of our study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity values of {{in situ hybridisation}} and histology for the detection of M. refringens, based on 3 populations of flat oysters, free of the disease and with mild and high levels of prevalence. A blind assay of 200 individuals from each population was performed using both techniques.

Assumptions and results were found to vary slightly with the different statistical approaches. The more realistic estimate by the Bayesian approach shows a link between the level of prevalence and the sensitivity of the techniques. Values of sensitivity and specificity for histology were 0. 7 and 0. 99 respectively, and 0. 9 and 0. 99 respectively in the case of in situ hybridisation.

40|$|Research PaperBritain has {{traditionally}} {{tried to protect}} its livestock, fish and shellfish production industries from many serious diseases by restricting imports of live animals- fish and shellfish to those from countries free of specified important diseases affecting particular classes of stock. Although the primary aim of the European Union has been to remove restrictions on trade between member states, the restriction of movements of stock to avoid the introduction of serious diseases into disease-free areas has also been enshrined in EU legislation. For aquaculture animals, the provisions enabling such controls were introduced in 1991 in directive 91 / 67 of the Council of the European Communities (OJ No. L 46 / 1). These allowed for the delineation of 'approved zones' free {{of one or more}} specified diseases within which introductions of susceptible species from outwith the approved zones can be banned. This paper considers the economics of establishing an approved zone in Great Britain for the diseases <b>Marteilia</b> <b>refringens</b> and Bonamia ostreae, to which the native flat oyster, Ostrea edulis, is susceptible. The granting of an approved zone requires submission of evidence to the Commission, from three years of intensive resting to establish the disease-free status of the area. In Great Britain, this process of testing of shellfish in relation to the diseases was completed in 1995 and the decision was to be made whether to proceed with an application for approved zone status for these diseases. The maintenance of an approved zone involves costs for the industry and national government in terms of additional monitoring of shellfish health status and the monitoring and application of controls on Imports. The bearing of these costs provides an uncertain gain in terms of a reduction in the risk of introduction of the disease(s) into the area, and consequent losses, both of current shellfish stocks and future production of shellfish. An appropriate methodology for analysing a decision of this sort, in which risk and uncertainty are central factors, is provided by statistical decision theory (Schlaifer 1959. Charnoff and Moses 1959. Raiffa and Schlaifer 1961) and specifically the use of decision trees. These have been found useful in a very wide range of applications from medicine (Keeler 1995) to accounting (Siedel 1991) to American football (Stoughton 1986). From the literature, it is clear that their main use has been in the business context (Coles and Rowley 1995, Boys 1990, Brookfield 1988). There is little in the literature to indicate their use in assisting national policy decision-making, yet risk and uncertainty is just as likely to be important in national decisions as business decisions. In this paper, the use of decision trees to analyse the potential gain to Britain from approved zone status for Marteilia and Bonamia is discussed. Particular problems addressed are those relating to the assessment of probabilities of disease outbreak, and issues relating to the time-frame of the analysis, given that the costs of enforcing an approved zone may be discontinued at any point (along with the approved zone), whereas the losses incurred {{in the event of an}} outbreak of the disease may continue for many years...|$|E
40|$|Marine animals inhabiting {{polluted}} {{coastal waters}} nearness urbanised areas {{may be affected}} by a complex of toxic substances of domestic and industrial origin. Campania region with its main Naples city and Caserta province are italian areas with high pollutant impact (Maselli et al., 2010; Senior and Mazza, 2003; Imperato et al., 2003. In order to assess the biological effects of this condition, mussels belonging to Mytilus galloprovincialis species were collected in 12 rearing farms distributed from northern to southeast part of Campanian coast from January 2008 to July 2010 in A and B zone, repartition for mollusks rearing (Dlg. 854 / 2004); at the same time, from October 2008 to December 2009, sampling of three different species of mollusks occupying different ecological niche (M. galloprovincialis, Tapes philippinarum and Patella caerulea) were conducted at Volturno River Estuary. Tissue-level biomarkers including Defensive phenomena (Haemocyte clusters, Granuloma, Perintestinal inflammation, interstitial inflammation, Brown cells), Regressive phenomena (gonadal atresia and digestive tubules atrophy), Progressive phenomena (gonadal and haemic neoplasia), were recorded and measured in term of prevalence and intensity and related to the different sites. A total of 31 pathological parameters were recorded in the reared animals along Campanian coast, comprehended different inflammatory response, in some case related to pathogens or as apparent non-specific reaction and regressive changes represented by digestive gland epithelial thinning, often accompanied by intense haemocyte reaction. Moreover, in three areas, cases of Disseminated Neoplasia (DN) presented peculiar cellularity, monomorphism or polymorphism, were observed with a prevalence of 10 %, usually few represented in the literature in M. galloprovincialis. Different kind of pathogens (Steinhausia mytilovum, <b>Marteilia</b> <b>refringens,</b> Nematopsis sp., Proctoecoes maculatus) and symbionts (Eugymnanthea inquilina, Ancystrum mytili, Rinkodid-like phyllopharingea protozoa) have been recorded, some of them observed {{for the first time}} in the area (Carella et. al., 2010; Carella et al., in press). Prevalence of recorded lesions was equally distributed, did not show a clear temporal trend, present almost in all the samples and abundant in both A and B zones. Defensive phenomena such as non-specific inflammatory responses and regressive changes are useful tools to assess environmental quality in pollution monitoring programmes (Couch, 1985; Au, 2004; Kim et al., 2007). On the basis of our observation, we have identified areas with detrimental conditions that, for current law (Dlg. 854 / 2004) are considered appropriate for mollusk designated to food consumption; this areas, evaluated using these pathological parameters, based on recognized international standard, wouldn’t be considered anymore appropriate, because of stressful environmental condition. On regarding on Volturno River estuary mollusk population, we have described different gonadal lesions in sampled animals. In particular, about the limpet (Patella coerulea), the majority of males collected at January 2008 showed unusual gonadal disorders, such as early change of sex, pathological hermaphroditism and germinoma (Carella et al., 2009). At the end of the year, limpets population of the estuary decline to finally disappear. Literature suggests these findings could be related to some gonadal alteration, in both humans (Testicular Disgenesis Syndrome -TDS), and animals (lower vertebrates and invertebrates) exposed to Endocrine Disruptor (ED) chemicals; these are heterogeneous classes of chemical pollutants acting upon the endocrine system, which adversely affect reproduction and development of aquatic organisms, causing negative changes in community structure, abundance, diversity and composition. In order to confirm our pathogenetic hypothesis, adult limpets (Patella caerulea) at different stages of gonadal development were exposed, for 30 days, to xenoestrogen 4 -Nonylphenol (1, 100, 200 μg/L) and estrogen 17 β estradiol (1, 100 μg/L). Results showed females in more advanced phases of development than corresponding controls, while males exhibited active proliferating oocytes. In one male individual, exposed to 17 β estradiol 100 μg/L, a case of intersex was recorded. In order to follow male and female gonad development during experiments, a GnRH probe has been produced on the basis of GnRH aminoacidic sequence in the genome of Lottia gigantea gastropod. In summary, we have provided data on health status of animals on Campanian coast throughout an integrative study of tissue-level biomarkers with natural and experimental measures, helpful to support the present conclusions. Moreover, such data suggest the prosobranch limpet Patella coerulea could be a reliable and effective model for EDc exposure and GnRH molecule as a new possible biomarker for such substances...|$|E
40|$|For the {{management}} of the shellfish sector, shellfish are regularly imported from various European countries into the Dutch coastal waters. With the import of shellfish, there is a risk of unintentional introduction of exotic species, pests and diseases that could have harmful effects. Therefore, the transports or shellfish are watched critically by the various stakeholders. The present study focuses on the risks of the unintentional introduction of new exotic species with the shellfish transports. We define exotic species as species that are non-indiginous for the Northeast Atlantic continental shelf area and are introduced into this area by human activities. The biogeographical area Northeast Atlantic continental shelf region ranges from the Northern part of Spain to the coastal areas of Norway. Once established somewhere in the Northeast Atlantic continental shelf, shellfish transports can accelerate the introduction into the Dutch coastal waters. Far from every introduction of exotic species becomes a pest. However, once introduced it is very difficult if not impossible to remove the species from the ecosystem. In this study, the risks of unintentional introduction of exotic species with various shellfish transports are evaluated. The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality will use this information to develop a new national policy for the transfer of shellfish. Recently, the debate on the present policy that dates from 1997 has intensified due to judgments of the Council of State and the European Court of Justice. Moreover, the shellfish farmers are more and more interested to transfer mussels and seed mussels that have been captured with mussel seed capture devices from the Oosterschelde and the Voordelta to the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. This transport is prohibited under the present policy. The invasiveness of a species {{is an important factor in}} a risk assessment for the introduction of exotic species. The list “ 100 of the World’s most invasive alien species” gives a good overview of the species with the highest risks. As a first indication this list is very useful, however, it should not be assumed that the list is complete. Besides as assessment on species, the risks can also be assessed on the location from where the shellfish are imported. Most of the exotic species that are present in the Dutch coastal waters have their area of origin in NW Pacific (39 species) or the NW Atlantic Ocean (26 species). The majority of he exotic species are introduced the Dutch coastal areas by secondary transport. Shellfish imports from Ireland, UK and France show the highest risks on introducing exotic species due to the number of exotic species in these countries and the environmental conditions that are comparable to the conditions in the Dutch coastal waters. According to the national policy on shellfish transfer, it is obliged to transfer shellfish from the Oosterschelde and Voordelta to the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea (South – North transport). The risks of this transport on introduction of exotic species have been evaluated by means of expert judgment and literature review. A group of 11 national and international experts have been consulted for this study. A list of exotic species of the South (Oosterschelde, Voordelta, Grevelingenmeer and Veerse Meer) has been compiled and compared with the list of exotic species present in the North (Dutch part of the Wadden Sea). The target species, species that are present in the South but not in the North could potentially be introduced in the Dutch Wadden Sea with the shellfish transfer from the South. The risks of each of the 65 target species have been evaluated semi-quantitatively from the chance of successful introduction and the expected impact. The species with the highest risks are the tunicates Didemnum sp. and Botrylloides violaceus, the copepods Mytilicola orientalis and M. ostreae, the American whelk tingle Urosalpinx cinerea, the bryozoa Smittoidea prolifica, the protist <b>Marteilia</b> <b>refringens</b> and the marcoalgae Gracilaria vermiculophylla, Polysiphonia senticulosa and Undaria pinnatifida. At present it is allowed and common practice to transfer mussels from the Danish and German parts of the Wadden Sea to the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. The risks assessment indicates that with these shellfish transfers 46 exotic species could potentially be introduced into the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. The species with the highest risks are mainly macroalgae: Gracilaria vermiculophylla, Heterosiphonia japonica and Laminaria ochotensis. The risks of shellfish transfers within the Wadden Sea are lower than the risks of shellfish transfer from South to North. During the Summer of 2008, 30 samples have been taken from mussels in the water column (rope culture and Mussel seed capture devices) and from the bottom (culture plots and natural beds), both in the Oosterschelde and the Voordelta. The samples have been analyzed for associated flora and fauna. Special attention was paid to the exotic species. In total 12 exotic species were identified in the samples. In the samples from the Voordelta only one exotic species was found (Sargassum muticum). The exotic species accounted for more than 10 percent of the total number of species identified in samples from the Oosterschelde. There was a clear distinction in species composition between the samples from the water column and from the bottom. Characteristic species for the bottom samples were the American slipper limpet (Crepidula fornicata), the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), the brush-clawed shore crab (Hemigrapsus takanoi) and the polychate Syllis gracilis. Characteristic species for the suspended culture are the macroalgae Sargassum muticum, Codium fragile and Undaria pinnatifida and the tunicate Styela clava. The present study is primarily focused on exotic species that might be introduced with shellfish transports. However, also other harmful not-exotic organisms such as toxic algae, pests and diseases could be unintentionally (re-) introduced with the shellfish. Based on the results of this study the research questions as formulated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality can be answered as follows: 1. Shellfish import from France, Ireland and the UK constitutes the highest risk at introduction of exotic species with shellfish transfer into the Dutch coastal waters. The risks of import from Ireland and UK to the Oosterschelde have been quantified in a previous study, the PRIMUS study. 2. The list with “ 100 of the World’s most invasive alien species” gives a good indication of the invasiveness, and thus potential impact of species. However, the list is not exhaustive. 3. The risks of introducing exotic species with shellfish transfer from South to North are not absent. The report gives an overview of risk species and a quantification of the risks. The number of exotic species associated with rope culture and mussel seed capture devices in the Oosterschelde corresponds to the number of exotic species associated with the bottom culture. However, the composition of the exotics differ. 4. The risks of introducing exotic species with shellfish transfer within the Wadden Sea (Danish and German Wadden Sea to the Dutch Wadden Sea) is less than the risks of shellfish tranports from the Oosterschelde and Voordelta to the Wadden Sea. The report gives an overview of the risk species and a quantification of the risks...|$|E
