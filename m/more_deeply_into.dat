5|$|Apart {{from these}} more {{spectacular}} pieces of resistance, {{in some places}} chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners to pay them to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, William Dowsing was commissioned {{to the task of}} image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, was enormous. In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing and for many, the sale of vestments and plate was an opportunity to make money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> popular thinking).|$|E
5|$|The Erromintxela {{arrived in}} the Basque Country in the 15th century {{speaking}} Kalderash Romani. They integrated much <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> Basque society than other Romani groups. In the process, they acquired the Basque language and adopted aspects of Basque culture such as increased rights of women and important traditions such as bertsolaritza (extemporaneous poetic song) and pelota (the national Basque ballgame). Muñoz and Lopez de Mungia suspect that the morphological and phonological similarities between Romani and Basque facilitated the adoption of Basque grammar by the bilingual Romanis.|$|E
5|$|In the north, they {{hibernate}} {{during the}} winter. Niell (1947, 1948) made observations in Georgia, and noted {{they were one}} of the last species to seek shelter, often being found active until the first heavy frosts. At this point, they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark. These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> the soft wood or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November. During a period of three or four days, as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming across Back Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland. He suggested this might {{have something to do with}} hibernating habits. In the southern parts of its range, hibernation may be short or omitted altogether.|$|E

25|$|Beginning of the End made Bert I. Gordon {{famous for}} his giant monster films. Critics and film historians {{point out that the}} film {{is only one of many}} which drew heavily on most Americans' fear about atomic weapons, open-air nuclear tests, and the {{possibility}} of nuclear war. However, Beginning of the End had very little of the metaphorical creativity of films such as Godzilla or Them! A more recent assessment, however, concludes that the film taps <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> 1950s Americans' worries over invasive species and growing unease over pesticides (like DDT).|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century, as the Romanian society transitioned {{from rural}} and {{agricultural}} towards urban and industrial, the lexis underwent a vigorous enrichment with loanwords from its Romance relatives, French and Italian. Many scholarly and technical terms were also imported from Neo-Latin. Some words, especially of Greek (arvună, ipochimen, simandicos) and Turkish (acadea, beizadea, hatâr) origin, fell into relative disuse or acquired an ironic connotation. The Slavic {{part of the}} lexis, of earlier entry and <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> anchored <b>into</b> the language, survived relatively unscathed.|$|R
25|$|The Great Falls of the Missouri River formed {{because the}} Missouri is flowing over {{and through the}} Kootenai Formation, a mostly nonmarine {{sandstone}} laid down by rivers, glaciers, and lakes in the past. Some of the Kootenai Formation is marine, however, laid down by shallow seas. The river is eating away at the softer nonmarine sandstone, with the harder rock forming the falls themselves.

25|$|Another paragraph, not {{actually}} {{part of the}} essay on Lamb and Irving, is tacked on {{to the end of}} the English editions (but not the Paris edition) of The Spirit of the Age, in which Hazlitt offers a few appreciative words about his friend James Sheridan Knowles (1784–1862), an Irish-born actor and dramatist whose family had moved to England when he was a child. When Knowles was only 15 years old, Hazlitt, then earning a living primarily as a portrait painter, was commissioned to capture Knowles and his sister on canvas. Knowles and Hazlitt took a liking to each other, kept in touch, and as Hazlitt delved <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> literature, he took the talented younger man, who had already published poetry, under his wing, offering constructive criticism of his literary output. Distance kept the two apart for years, but they maintained a friendly relationship, later finding time to see each other in London and Scotland.|$|E
25|$|During {{the colonial}} years, the Seminole were {{on good terms}} with both the Spanish and the British. In 1784, after the American Revolutionary War, Britain came to a {{settlement}} with Spain and transferred East and West Florida to it. The Spanish Empire's decline enabled the Seminole to settle <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> Florida. They were led by a dynasty of chiefs of the Alachua chiefdom, founded in eastern Florida in the 18th century by Cowkeeper. Beginning in 1825, Micanopy was the principal chief of the unified Seminole, {{until his death in}} 1849, after Removal to Indian Territory. This chiefly dynasty lasted past Removal, when the US forced the majority of Seminole to move from Florida to the Indian Territory (modern Oklahoma) after the Second Seminole War. Micanopy's sister's son, John Jumper, succeeded him in 1849 and, after his death in 1853, his brother Jim Jumper became principal chief. He was in power through the American Civil War, after which the US government began to interfere with tribal government, supporting its own candidate for chief.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the mid 1870s, armor {{was made}} of wrought iron plate, {{sometime}} backed with wood. In the 1870s, compound armor was developed, where a hardened steel face was cemented to a softer iron backing, which prevented cracking. During the late 1880s, nickel-steel armor was devised and in 1890, the Harvey process was developed, where a nickel-steel plate was treated with carbon and hardened in cold water. [...] This process allowed one homogeneous steel plate to have both a hard surface and a softer back which was less likely to crack. During the 1890s, Krupp armor further refined the Harvey process by including additional metals in the alloy and developing a system where the hardening process penetrated <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> the plates. Tests showed that [...] of Krupp armor was equal to [...] of Harvey armor, [...] of compound armor, and [...] of wrought iron plate, while in thinner plates, Harvey armor was basically equal to Krupp.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the impact of}} {{corporate}} restructuring in the British building societies movement is examined {{as an example of}} the changing organisation of the financial services industry, a significant component of the service sector. It is argued that regulatory changes, which have broken down the segmented and compartmentalised nature of the financial sector, have provided the opportunity for large building societies to diversify into new markets, and this in turn has encouraged a round of innovation in the financial services industry. It is also suggested that as the building society movement has become <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> integrated <b>into</b> the financial sector as a whole, this has promoted a drift in employment towards the south and east of the country and a shift back to larger urban areas in the provinces. ...|$|R

IGN echoed this statement, calling {{the difference between}} Baldur's Gate and Shadows of Amn [...] "like looking at a still oil painting, and then turning to see the scene in living motion on a big screen TV."

[...] Much of the episode's action focused on Byers, played by Bruce Harwood. This experience was different for him, and he noted, [...] "I don't think I'd ever done an episode where I was the lead character.

On the basis of ethnographic research in two congressional campaigns in the United States, I will argue here that specific mundane internet tools (like email) are much <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> integrated <b>into</b> mobilizing practices today than emerging tools (like social networking sites) and specialized tools (like campaign websites). Campaigns’ reliance on mundane internet tools challenges the prevalent idea that sophisticated “hypermedia” turn people into “managed citizens. ” Instead I suggest we theorize internet-assisted activism as a process for the coproduction of citizenship and recognize how dependent even well-funded political organizations are on the wider built communications environment and today’s relatively open internet...|$|R
