40|$|The image {{generation}} procedure {{produces a}} mosaic image (15) from a two- or three-dimensional pattern (6) using an image processing system (1). Data giving {{information about the}} image is processed in an electronic data processing system (2), which may be a personal computer, with a screen showing the pattern for the mosaic. The personal computer provides output information {{which is used to}} control one robot-type <b>manual</b> <b>manipulator.</b> The <b>manual</b> <b>manipulator</b> takes mosaic segments from a store (13) and places them on an associated support (14) {{in such a way that}} the colour of each segment is within the tolerance for that particular area of the image. ADVANTAGE - Enables variety of mosaic images to be produced, using segments made of different materials, sizes and shapes and positioned at differing distances...|$|E
40|$|Self-balancing <b>manual</b> <b>manipulators</b> are {{devices that}} countervail {{the weight of}} a load that must be {{manually}} handled and moved by a human operator. An electric motor delivers the force needed to control the velocity of a spool with a metallic rope to which the load is hanged. This work concerns the tuning of the DC electric motor velocity controller. Specifically, Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning has been applied, which provides controller parameter tuning in a completely automatic way based on a single I/O batch measurement on the plant. The tuned controller shows good tracking performances and good robustness to variation in the applied load...|$|R
50|$|Jeka Wynzorr was {{the princess}} of the planet Orando, a world {{populated}} by a ruling class of large, sentient, snakes and an underclass of (similarly sentient) small, raccoon-like mammals. However, she renounced this heritage to travel the galaxy, using her illusion-casting powers to disguise herself as a humanoid to avoid attention. It is not explained how her race, which lack <b>manual</b> <b>manipulators,</b> constructed an advanced civilization; however, it is implied {{that it may have}} been via the enslavement of the raccoons. Upon joining the Legion, she immediately donned a set of cybernetic arms, which she was thereafter rarely seen without.|$|R

Product pattern and pouring system model formed with expandable polystyrene beads, and assemble {{them into a}} model cluster, man can drying them after the model cluster dipping {{with the aid of}} <b>manual</b> or <b>manipulator.</b> Put the drying model cluster into the single sand box which with a negative pressure pumping system, a single dry sand rain-type sand system filling and compaction.

Recently, {{studies showed that}} chimpanzees’ manual laterality is influenced by functional, interactional and individual factors and their mutual intertwinement. However, what about manual laterality in species living in stable social groups? We tackled this question by studying three groups of captive gorillas (N = 35) and analysed their most frequent <b>manual</b> signals: three <b>manipulators</b> and 16 gesture types. Our multifactorial investigation showed that conspecific-directed gestures were overall more right-lateralized than conspecific-directed manipulators. Furthermore, it revealed a difference between conspecific- and human-directed gestural laterality for signallers living {{in one of the}} study groups. Our results support the hypothesis that gestural laterality is a relevant marker of language left-brain specialisation. We suggest that components of communication and of manipulation (not only of an object but also of a conspecific) do not share the same lateralised cerebral system in some primate species...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{intelligence of}} sensor guided industrial robots {{enable them to}} overtake more and more applicational tasks. Despite that, there always will be left a certain spectrum of handling tasks, that {{still have to be}} performed by a human operator controlling a manipulating arm - due to complexity and safety reasons. Unfortunately <b>manual</b> positioning of <b>manipulators</b> is generally a permanent source for operational faults, accidents and high costs. To overcome the given problem a hybrid control system architecture is proposed that allows: manual arm control, program execution and the smooth switch among both operational modes at any time. As key component a Context-Sensitive Online Program Generator is specified, developed and implemented. The validity of the chosen approach and its possibilities are proven in a 3 D-graphical simulation incorporating all high-level control modules and the operator interface. The applicational requirements for the control system architecture are exempla rily taken from a heavy duty handling task in coal mining...|$|R
