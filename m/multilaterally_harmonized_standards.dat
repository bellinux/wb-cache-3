Usage of the <b>harmonized</b> <b>standards</b> is voluntary and provides presumption of conformity.

50|$|The main {{objective}} of the CPR is the removal of technical barriers to trade in order to guarantee the free movement of construction products within the common internal market due to differing product and test standards, approval processes and conformity documents in the various member states. Key element to this, are the <b>Harmonized</b> Product <b>Standard</b> and the European Technical Approval. <b>Harmonized</b> <b>standards</b> are established by the European standardizations bodies CEN (European Committee for Standardization) and Cenelec (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization) with the involvement of stakeholders. Where a manufacturer would like to declare the characteristics for a construction product not yet covered by a <b>harmonized</b> product <b>standard,</b> he may use the procedure to establish a European technical assessment.|$|R

Furthermore no limits have been published for the DC bus, which acts, due to its large length, as an antenna. The experimentally obtained data presented in this paper show that PV inverters are causing serious interference, and thus do not fulfil (the essential) requirements of the EMC Directive...|$|R

40|$|Standards, {{including}} {{food safety}} standards, {{have become a}} key tool in the governance of the world economy. The current drive to <b>harmonize</b> these <b>standards</b> {{on a global scale}} is supposed to reduce technical barriers to trade and create conditions for fair and free trade. However, as the case of the Polish meatpacking industry shows, standards often create new barriers because they are embedded in specific geographies. On the one hand, many <b>harmonized</b> <b>standards</b> favor large-scale multinational capital and bar local small-scale producers.
