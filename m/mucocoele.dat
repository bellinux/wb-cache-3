40|$|Introduction: <b>Mucocoele</b> of the {{appendix}} is an obstructive dilatation of {{the appendix}} by intraluminal accumulation of mucoid material. Mucocoeles may develop {{by one of}} four processes: Retention cysts, Mucosal hyperplasia, Cystadenomas, and Cystadenocarcinomas. The clinical presentation of a mucocele is nonspecific and often an incidental finding at operation for acute appendicitis. If <b>mucocoele</b> is allowed to rupture either spontaneously or during surgery, the escape of mucin and epithelial cells into the peritoneal cavity – Pseudomyxoma Peritonei – may occur. Presentation of case: We present {{the case of a}} 35 years old pregnant woman, who was admitted to the accident and emergency department with history and ultrasound findings suggestive of acute appendicitis. The ultrasound scan also confirmed a viable fetus at about 23  week’s gestational age. She had an open appendectomy. The intra-operative findings were an enlarged, tense, cystic retro-caecal appendix which was about 14  cm ×  5  cm ×  3  cm in dimensions. Histopathological examination confirmed <b>mucocoele</b> of the appendix. She had normal vaginal delivery at term and postoperative follow up for 1 year was uneventful. Discussion: Mucocele of the appendix is an uncommon disorder with nonspecific presentation ranging from asymptomatic disease diagnosed incidentally to clinical features of appendicitis. The treatment is surgery. Conclusion: Appendiceal <b>mucocoele</b> is difficult to diagnose preoperatively, and a giant size of the simple <b>mucocoele</b> may be connected to hormonal influence of pregnancy.

40|$|<b>Mucocoele</b> of the {{appendix}} occurs when obstruction of the appendiceal lumen results in mucus accumulation and consequent abnormal dilatation. The most impor-tant aetiology, from a surgical perspective, is either mucinous cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. In the latter, a spontaneous or iatrogenic rupture of the <b>mucocoele</b> {{can lead to}} mucinous intraperitoneal ascites, a syndrome known as pseudomyxoma peritonei. Optimal management of mucoceles is achieved through accurate preoperative identification and subsequent careful resection.

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for paranasal sinus <b>mucocoele</b> with orbital involvement and assess {{the frequency with which}} a direct orbital approach is required in these cases. Methods Retrospective, consecutive series of sinus mucocoeles with orbital involvement treated by ESS by a single surgeon over a 4 -year period (1998 – 2002). Results A total of 24 mucocoeles of 15 patients, including 10 frontal, eight frontoethomoidal, two ethmoidal, and four maxillary. All cases demonstrated radiological orbital extension. Globe displacement was seen in 73 %. At a median follow-up of 15. 5 months, the mean cumulative clinical score improved from 4. 2 1. 5 (range 1 – 7) to 0. 40. 7 (range 0 – 2). Ophthalmic symptoms and signs resolved in all patients but one who had complex sinus anatomy following neurosurgery. Minor, self-limiting complications including epistaxis and intranasal adhesions occurred in three cases. Additional endoscopic sinus surgery was required in four patients for revision of narrowed frontal sinus ostium (two), <b>mucocoele</b> recurrence (two), and sinus toileting (one). No cases required external sinus surgery and the average hospital in-patient stay was 2. 5 1. 6 days. At final follow-up, sinus ostia were patent in all excluding one case that required a stent due to disrupted anatomy. Conclusion ESS is effective in improving ophthalmic symptoms and signs due to paranasal sinus <b>mucocoele.</b> ESS may be a viable treatment for paranasal sinus <b>mucocoele</b> with orbital extension, and a direct orbital approach is rarely necessary...|$|E

40|$|The factors {{enhancing}} <b>mucocoele</b> {{development in}} dogs remain poorly understood. A 7 -year-old female spayed Miniature Schnauzer {{was presented to}} the Massey University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for progressive lethargy, inappetance and abdominal discomfort. Initial physical examination findings revealed a moderate degree of cranial abdominal pain, with subsequent diagnostic tests confirming the patient as having diabetes mellitus, with a concurrent marked hypertriglyceridaemia. In an attempt to localise the source of pain, an ultrasound examination of the abdomen was performed, revealing a marked degree of gallbladder sludge. With appropriate medical management including ursodeoxycholic acid and insulin therapy, the patient stabilised and was discharged. With persistence of clinical signs three months later, progression of the gallbladder sludge towards <b>mucocoele</b> development was suspected. Exploratory laparotomy was instigated, and an emergency cholecystectomy was performed. This case report therefore entails a suspected gallbladder <b>mucocoele</b> that developed in a diabetic patient with previously diagnosed biliary sludge. A unique feature of this case report is the presence of diabetes mellitus, which has been suggested to be a causative factor in the development of gallbladder mucocoeles. It is also hypothesised that gallbladder sludge and mucocoeles are associated, however it is yet to be ascertained whether this association is causal or contributory. The authors examined the possible relationship between this endocrinopathy and biliary sludge, and their possible effects on <b>mucocoele</b> development. Specific associated factors to sludge formation are also examined. The medical and surgical management of gallbladder mucocoeles is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Early {{diagnosis}} of sphenoidal sinus mucocoeles presenting with visual loss is important as appropriately timed surgical intervention may improve the visual deficit.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONDespite {{the fact}} the <b>mucocoele</b> of the {{appendix}} is a rare entity {{it has been the}} subject of much interest in the literature. The term <b>mucocoele</b> refers to cystic dilatation of the appendix filled with mucin resulting from proximal obstruction of the appendix lumen. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe report two patients presenting with mucinous cystadenoma of the appendix with elevation of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which has rarely been reported. Both patients had mild symptoms and a normal colonoscopy preoperatively. The diagnosis was not suspected in one patient prior to surgery. The elevated CEA prompted additional diagnostic radiologic investigations including ultrasonography, and computed tomography scans. The patients had uneventful appendicectomies with subsequent normalization of their CEA levels. DISCUSSIONMucinous cystadenoma of the appendix is a rare pathological entity characterized by a dilated mucous filled appendix. The presence of an elevated CEA associated with the presence of this entity is a rare presentation. CONCLUSIONBecause the diagnosis is rarely suspected prior to surgery patients with an enlarged appendix with associated elevated CEA levels should have careful investigations to exclude malignancy...|$|E

40|$|Background. <b>Mucocoele</b> is histopathologically benign, cystic {{change of}} {{paranasal}} sinuses filled with mucoid contents, which with its growth is pressuring and destroying local bone walls. In only 3 % {{of the cases}} it can be localized in maxillary sinuses. Etiology is unknown. Pyocoele develops by secondary infection. Case report. The male patient was 21 years old. His symptoms were runny nose with thick contents and heavy breathing {{on the right side}} of the nose, headaches, as well as the swelling of the right cheek. During clinical examination, the expansive change was found. It was completely closing the right side of the nose cavity. Computerized tomography (CT) of paranasal cavities showed excessive expansion of the right maxillary sinus, with very thinned walls, while the cavity was filled with liquid. After antibiotics therapy, the radical operation of the right maxillary sinus was performed, based on Caldwell Luc method. The frontal wall was found to be extremely convex and thinned, while the medial wall was with dehiscention. The cystic change was extirpated. <b>Mucocoele</b> was proved by pathohistologic findings. Its wall was about 2 mm thick and it showed squamous metaplasia in the large part of the mucocoela epithel. In the submucosa fibrosis and inflammatory infiltrate was present. Postoperative follow-up was under control. Clinically and radiographycaly, six months after therapy, the patient does not have troubles. Conclusion. The rare localization of the mucocoeles in maxillary sinus can be explained with the width of the maxillary ostia. Infected mucocoeles, expanded to the local anatomical structures, should be operated on with classic radical surgical operation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of cases with common canalicular obstruction poses a difficult problem. Nineteen patients presenting with common canalicular obstruction of unknown cause or {{in association with}} trauma, encysted <b>mucocoele</b> and previous sac surgery, were operated on by the modified canaliculodacryocystorhinostomy technique. The surgery involves a microsurgical dissection {{at the site of}} the common canalicular obstruction followed by anastomosis to the sac or nasal mucosa with silicone tube intubation of the passage using an improvised metallic introducer. The procedure was successful in 13 of the cases in a follow-up period varying from 4 months to 15 months. The complications included extrusion of the tube and nasal bleeding. The indications of the procedure, the precise technique and precautions to avoid intra and post operative complications have been elaborated in the paper...|$|E
30|$|Mucinous cystadenoma of the {{appendix}} {{belongs to the}} histological category of <b>mucocoele</b> (mucin-filled cystic dilatation) of the vermiform appendix [1] and is being found in 0.2 – 0.3 % of all appendectomy specimens. Although rare, mucinous cystadenoma represents 63 – 84 % of all mucocoeles [2]. These tumours are benign unless they disseminate through the wall of {{the appendix}} or rupture. A correlation between the intraperitoneal spread of neoplastic cells from these mucinous tumours and the clinical picture of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) has been found, though clear evidence of a causal relationship is missing. PMP is a unique slowly progressing condition characterised by extensive mucus accumulation within the abdomen and pelvis, gradually filling the peritoneal cavity, resulting in the characteristic “jelly belly” and leading, inevitably, to intestinal obstruction, nutritional compromise and death, unless definitively treated. Cytoreductive surgery and heated intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy increase the survival rates from zero to approximately 80 % [3, 4].|$|E
40|$|Gallbladder <b>mucocoele</b> (GBM) is an abnormal, intraluminal {{accumulation}} of inspissated bile and/or mucous within the gallbladder. Older, small- to medium-breed dogs {{seem to be}} predisposed, but no sex predilection has been identified. Clinical signs are often non-specific and include vomiting, lethargy, anorexia, abdominal pain, icterus and polyuria–polydipsia. Results of a complete blood count may be unremarkable, but serum biochemistry usually reveals increased liver enzymes. The ultrasonographic appearance is diagnostic and well described in the literature. Surgical intervention {{for the treatment of}} GBM remains the therapeutic gold standard, with short- and long-term survival for biliary surgery being 66 %. The worst outcome is seen in those dogs requiring cholecystoenterostomy. With GBM becoming an apparently increasingly common cause of extrahepatic biliary disease in canines, it is essential that clinicians become familiar with the current literature pertaining to this condition. Numerous predisposing factors are highlighted in this review article and the role of certain endocrinopathies (e. g. hyperadrenocorticism and hypothyroidism) in the development of GBM is touched upon.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} and {{factors associated with}} restenosis after Draf type III (Endoscopic Modified Lothrop) frontal sinus drainage procedure. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. A hundred and twenty two consecutive patients undergoing Draf III procedure for recalcitrant chronic frontal rhinosinusitis (CRS) (71 %), frontal sinus <b>mucocoele</b> (15 %), benign frontal sinus tumours (9 %) and cystic fibrosis with severe CRS (5 %) were followed up {{for an average of}} 33 months. Symptom burden (Visual Analogue Scale and Rhinosinusitis Outcome Measure), patency of neo-ostium and revision surgery. At the end of follow up, ninety percent of patients had a patent neo-ostium, while 88 % were either clinically better or completely asymptomatic. Thirty-nine patients required endoscopic revision surgery and 9 eventually underwent frontal sinus obliteration. Sixty percent of revision operations were performed during the first two years. RSOM showed a significant improvement in both general and nasal symptoms while on a VAS, headache improved significantly. The only factor weakly associated with re-stenosis was the presence of allergy. There were no major complications during any of the procedures. Draf III Procedure is safe and effective for patients who have failed conventional frontal sinus procedures and a valid alternative to frontal sinus obliteration. Although the revision rate may appear to be quite significant, it can often be performed as an outpatient procedure and needs to be balanced against the reduced morbidity and the ease of follow-u...|$|E
40|$|IAN G RENNIE, ' AND M ANDREW PARSONS 2 From the Departments of'Ophthalmology and 2 Pathology, University ofSheffield SUMMARY A 73 -year-old {{woman on}} topical {{pilocarpine}} and adrenaline for {{chronic simple glaucoma}} for three years presented with a mass in the medial canthus of the right eye. Although dacryocystography showed a dilated and partially obstructed nasolacrimal system, ultrasound examination was able to demonstrate a mass in the nasolacrimal duct. At operation a black dacryolith was found, of the diameter predicted by ultrasound. Histological examination of the dacryolith suggested its derivation from breakdown products of adrenaline. Ultrasound examination of the nasolacrimal drain-age system {{has been shown to}} be of value when the system is dilated in cases such as a <b>mucocoele</b> or acute dacryocystitis. It is of limited value in functional disorders, where the passage of fluid through the nasolacrimal system is slowed, producing a minimally dilated system. ' No reports so far have illustrated the ability of ultrasound to demonstrate a mass in the nasolacrimal duct. This case illustrates the use of ultrasound in the detection of a solid mass in the nasolacrimal drainage system. Case history A 73 -year-old retired nurse presented with chronic open-angle glaucoma in 1981, and she was treated with topical adrenaline 1 % twice daily to both eyes. Four months later her intraocular pressures were found to be uncontrolled, and pilocarpine 4 % four times daily was added to her medication to both eyes. In 1981 a left trabeculectomy was performed because of poor medical control. Pilocarpine and adrenaline were continued in the right eye. Because of travelling difficulties, from December 1981 her follow-up was continued at another unit. In 1986 she returned to this unit having suffered four episodes, over the previous eight months, of severe right-sided epiphora associated with a swelling over the right nasolacrimal duct. She also noted the presence of a rusty discharge down the right nostril and reflux of this fluid int...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{gallbladder}} is a surgically important organ, {{most often}} subjected to cholecystectomy for treating cholelithiasis. The presence of gallstones may precipitate {{the development of}} cholecystitis which may even lead to gallbladder malignancy, if not treated in time. Aim: The aims were to study the diverse morphological, histopathological and histochemical features of gallbladder specimens obtained at cholecystectomy done for various benign diseases of the GB. Material and methods: Included are 132 specimens of the gallbladder obtained at cholecystectomy done for benign diseases at Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India. The specimens thus obtained were studied for the morphological and histopathological changes. Each specimen was subjected to Sudan Black B, Methyl Green-Pyronin Y and Periodic acid-Schiff staining to confirm presence of lipid, plasma cells and glycogen, respectively in GB tissue samples. Results and Conclusion: Cholelithiasis was predominantly a female disease. The size of the GB varied from 10 cm (distended). Cholelithiasis was present in 97. 73 % of the cases studied. Of these, 89. 14 % had mixed stones and 10. 85 %, cholesterol stones. Of the cases studied, 8. 33 % had acute cholecystitis alone. It was associated with <b>mucocoele</b> or empyema of the GB in 3. 79 % and 5. 30 % cases, respectively. Histopathological changes consistent with chronic cholecystitis and cholesterolosis, respectively were seen in 76. 52 % and 6. 06 % cases. In the former patients, the presence of theplasma cells in the GB tissues was confirmed using MGPY staining. The presence of lipids in the GB tissue samples of the latter was confirmed using Sudan Black B staining. Cases of chronic cholecystitis with ectopic pancreatic tissue, colonic metaplasia and xanthogranuloma were also seen. Mixed atrophic-hyperplastic mucosa, being the commonest mucosal change was seen in 63. 64 % cases. Other mucosal changes included atrophic mucosa (in 21. 21 % cases) and hyperplasia (in 15. 15 % cases). The GB tissue samples in 7. 5 % cases showed PAS-positive mucinous metaplasia. The tissue samples obtained at cholecystectomy performed for various benign gallbladder diseases showed varieties of histomorphological changes, including metaplasia and precursor changes suggesting the high risk for gallbladder malignancy. This underscores the need for routine histopathological examination of appropriate tissue samples of the gallbladder obtained at cholecystectomy...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved. PURPOSE: To {{describe}} a new endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) technique and assess its efficacy. DESIGN: Prospective nonrandomized interventional case series. METHODS: A prospective series of 44 consecutive endonasal DCRs performed from January 1999 to December 2000 was {{entered into the}} study. The new technique involved creation of a large bony ostium and mucosal flaps to create an anastamosis between the lacrimal sac mucosa and nasal mucosa. Patients presenting with naso-lacrimal duct obstruction based on symptomatic, clinical, and radiologic grounds {{were included in the}} study. Patients who had undergone previous lacrimal surgery were excluded. Surgery was performed by two surgeons (A. T., P. J. W.) using a standardized operative technique. Patient demographics, presentation, examination findings, surgical and anesthetic data, postoperative success, complications, and follow-up were evaluated. Success was defined as anatomic patency as well as relief of symptoms as assessed by fluorescein flow on nasendoscopy, lacrimal syringing, and patient examination. Intubation of the lacrimal apparatus was performed in all operations and the tubes usually removed at 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively. After removal of the tubes follow-up was 13 months (mean, 12. 9 months; range, 9 - 28 months; standard deviation [SD], 6. 1 months). RESULTS: There were 36 patients (12 male/ 24 female) who underwent 44 endonasal DCRs. The average age of the patients was 62. 9 years old (range, 15 - 86 years old; SD, 19. 1 years) and the main presentation was with epiphora (93 %) and/or <b>mucocoele</b> (33 %). In 13 operations (30 %) a septoplasty was required at the time of surgery, and in 10 operations (23 %) further endoscopic sinus surgery was performed in conjunction with the DCR. Anatomic success with a patent nasolacrimal system was achieved in 40 of 44 operations (91 %). Symptomatic and anatomic success was seen in 39 of 44 operations (89 %). Five of the DCRs were classified as failures. In one DCR the patient was symptomatic despite a patent nasolacrimal system and well-healed ostium. In two DCRs preoperative medial canalicular problems were noted. In two DCRs scarring and fibrosis of ostium were noted. CONCLUSIONS: This new technique of endonasal DCR involves creation of a large ostium and construction of nasal and lacrimal sac mucosal flaps. Its anatomic success rate (91 % or 40 of 44 DCRs) compares favorably with the success rate of other techniques for endonasal DCR and is also similar to the success of external DCR. Experience in endoscopic nasal surgery is important in endonasal DCR surgery, as other ancillary procedures may be required within the nose at the time of surgery. Angelo Tsirbas and Peter J.

40|$|Infection {{with the}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is {{a major cause of}} morbidity and death globally, and the number of individuals infected with this virus is increasing in many nations. Advanced HIV infection causes immunocompromise that predisposes to opportunistic infections and malignancies that characterise the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although the management of many of these AIDS-associated infections and malignancies is by medical means, surgeons play an important role the diagnosis and management of many of these conditions. Furthermore, patients with HIV infection may present with surgical disorders or traumatic injuries that are not related to HIV or AIDS. Health care workers managing patients with HIV infection and AIDS, particularly those involved in performing invasive procedures, are at risk of exposure to this virus in infected blood and body fluids. St. Vincent's hospital, Sydney, is a teaching hospital and major treatment centre for patients with HIV infection and AIDS located in the inner-eastern suburbs of Sydney. Patients with HIV infection who underwent surgical procedures at St. Vincent's hospital during the period 1990 to 1999 were retrospectively reviewed in order to describe the nature of the operative procedures required in the management of these patients. There were 636 patients with documented infection with HIV who underwent 889 surgical procedures at St. Vincent's hospital during the period 1990 to 1999. The number of procedures performed for patients with known HIV infection was increasing during this period. Patients with HIV infection accounted for 1. 1 % of all surgical procedures performed at this institution during this period. The proportion of total operative cases that patients with known HIV infection represented was seen to be increasing during this period. Surgical procedures were performed during only a small proportion of admissions of patients with HIV infection to St. Vincent's hospital for this period (2. 4 % of these admissions). The patients were predominantly males in younger age groups. Anorectal procedures for the local treatment of benign conditions were the most common procedures performed for these patients, followed by procedures for the insertion or removal of long-term vascular access devices and other minor general surgical procedures. A large proportion of procedures were performed as day surgery cases (30 %). Only a small proportion of cases were for the management of traumatic conditions (3 %). A large proportion of patients with HIV infection (26 %) underwent more than one procedure during this period, with anorectal disorders a common cause of repeat surgical admission. The operative findings after 498 surgical procedures performed for 360 patients with documented HIV infection during the period 1995 to 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. The number of cases in which AIDS-defining conditions were encountered were recorded, and varied according to the types of procedures performed. Overall, seventy AIDS-defining conditions were found at operation during sixty-five procedures (13 % of all procedures for patients with HIV infection). Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was the most frequently encountered AIDS-defining disorder found at operation, accounting for 41 % of such conditions. Kaposi's sarcoma was the next most frequently encountered condition, accounting for 20 % of cases followed by cytomegalovirus infection (11 %). Procedures in which AIDS-defining conditions were commonly encountered included neurosurgical procedures (20 of 36 procedures were for AIDS-defining conditions), particularly stereotactic brain biopsy. Lymph node excision biopsies had AIDS-defining pathologies seen in 18 of 26 cases, particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. AIDS-defining conditions were diagnosed in only 4 % of anorectal procedures, with anal squamous cell malignant lesions a far more frequently observed disorder (diagnosed in 11 % of cases). The clinical details of all patients who met the clinical criteria for AIDS who underwent midline laparotomy at St. Vincent's hospital during the period 1987 to 1998 were retrospectively examined. Thirty patients with AIDS underwent thirty laparotomies during this period. AIDS-defining conditions were found at fourteen procedures (47 %). Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was found in eleven of these laparotomies, Kaposi's sarcoma in two and cytomegalovirus in one. In nine of the patients with AIDS-defining conditions, the post-operative diagnosis was different to that expected pre-operatively. Patients with AIDS-defining conditions found at laparotomy had significantly lower serum albumin concentrations and body weight compared with those with more conventional surgical diagnoses. There was no difference in CD 4 T-lymphocyte counts, the number of patients with a history of AIDS-defining conditions or the duration of HIV infection between these two groups. Patients with AIDS-defining conditions diagnosed at laparotomy required significantly longer post-operative hospital stays compared to those with other causes, although {{there was no difference in}} the incidence of post-operative complications or deaths occurring in these two groups. There was a high number of patients with post-operative complications seen after laparotomy (thirty-two complications in twenty-one patients; 70 % of all patients). Chest infections, systemic sepsis and wound infections were the most frequently encountered post-operative complications. Five deaths occurred within thirty days of operation (17 % of patients), and were due to overwhelming systemic sepsis in four cases and from blood loss and coagulopathy in one. The number and the nature of the complications and deaths occurring in patients with AIDS undergoing laparotomy at St. Vincent's hospital is in keeping with previously published reports from other centres. The clinical details of patients with documented HIV infection who underwent biliary tract procedures at St. Vincent's hospital during the period 1989 to 1998 were retrospectively reviewed. Eighteen patients with HIV (fourteen of which met the clinical criteria for AIDS) underwent cholecystectomy; ten for cholecystitis secondary to gallstones, one for <b>mucocoele</b> of the gallbladder due to obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone and seven for acalculous cholecystitis. Biliary tract procedures accounted for 24 % of all abdominal procedures during this period. Patients were mostly male and in a relatively young age range. Cytomegalovirus infection was found in five cases of acalculous cholecystitis, Cryptosporidia in five and Microsporidia in two. A significantly greater proportion of patients with acalculous cholecystitis had a history of AIDS, and these patients had lower CD 4 T-lymphocyte counts, compared with those patients with cholelithiasis. There was no statistical difference in the length of hospital admission or number of complications occurring in these two groups. Patients who had cholecystectomy performed as an elective procedure (n= 7) were compared with those who had this procedure performed during admission for acute cholecystitis (n= 11), and had a significantly lower duration of post-operative hospital stay. There was no difference in the number of complications occurring in these two groups. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in eight patients, and was not associated with a significant difference in hospital admission duration or incidence of complications when compared with the ten patients who underwent open cholecystectomy. The medical records of all patients presenting to St. Vincent's hospital during the period 1994 to 1998 with major penetrating wounds (gunshot wounds and stab wounds to the trunk or neck) were retrospectively examined to determine the number of such patients with a documented history of infection with HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV), or with risk factors for these infections. Of the 148 patients with major penetrating wounds who were managed at St. Vincent??s hospital during this period, 5. 4 % had documented infection HCV and 1. 3 % with HIV. Risk factors were documented in thirty-one individuals (21 %), with injecting drug use the most commonly recorded (19 %). Individuals infected with HIV represent a substantial workload for surgical specialists at St. Vincent's hospital. Surgical procedures were an uncommon cause of admission for patients with HIV infection, but were important in the diagnosis and management of many AIDS-associated conditions and were increasing in number. AIDS-defining conditions accounted for only a small proportion of operative interventions in patients with HIV infection.
