5000|$|<b>Manual</b> <b>block</b> systems work by {{dividing}} up a rail line into predefined [...] "blocks", which are typically demarcated by fixed signs. Authority {{to occupy a}} block is granted by some sort of central controller, usually a dispatcher, who has the sole authority to grant such access. Before the widespread adoption of radio communications on trains, authority to occupy a block, along with other instructions, were communicated to trains much as timetable train orders were with station agents and trackside telephones. Some railroads, notably the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), had a system of <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> signals activated by wayside operators in stations or interlocking towers {{eliminating the need for}} some trains to stop. [...] This <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> system is still on use on the Long Island Rail Road, which had been a subsidiary of the PRR.|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} signals can include Train Order signals, <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> signals or signals {{governing}} special safety appliances such as slide fences, non-interlocked sidings, road crossings, etc. These {{are much less}} common than the three standard types.|$|E
50|$|The first rulebook was {{released}} in January 1987. It contained rules for three types of train control: automatic block (ABS), <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> (MBS), and voice (VCS).

5000|$|A <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> {{system in}} the United States was {{implemented}} by the Pennsylvania Railroad about 1863, {{a couple of decades}} before other American railroads began using it. This system required a railroad employee stationed at each signal to set the signals according to instructions received by telegraph from dispatchers. English railroads also used a [...] "controlled manual" [...] block system, which was adapted for use in the U.S. by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad in 1882.|$|E

50|$|Bi-directional ABS {{was popular}} on lower density single track lines that {{nevertheless}} needed an upgrade from older train order or <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> systems. Bi-directional ABS {{was placed in}} service with the same passing siding infrastructure that operated under the older plain train order system. Opposing trains would still need to clear the main track based on their superiority or instructions, however, unlike under the older system, trains moving {{in the same direction}} could follow one another based on signal indication. This eliminated the need for some of the more cumbersome flagging procedures to protect the rear of trains working under the timetable and train order system.|$|E
30|$|One of {{the first}} {{analytical}} models was developed by Frank [44] in 1966 by studying the delay levels along a single track corridor considering both directional and bidirectional scenarios. He used one train running between two consecutive sidings (using <b>manual</b> <b>blocking</b> system) and a single average speed for each train to calculate the number of possible trains (theoretical capacity) on the given segment. Petersen [45] expanded Frank’s idea in 1974 by considering two different speeds, independent departure times, equal spacing between sidings, and constant delays between two trains. Higgins et al. [46] developed a model in 1998 for urban rail networks to evaluate the delays of trains by considering different factors such as trains’ schedule, track links, sidings, crossings, and the directional/bidirectional operation patterns throughout the network.|$|R

50|$|SEPTA later {{took over}} the station {{as part of the}} R3 West Chester Line. SEPTA {{discontinued}} regular passenger service in September 1986, due to deteriorating track conditions and Chester County's desire to expand facilities at Exton Station on SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale Line. Service was restored by the West Chester Railroad (WCRR) in 1997, a privately owned and operated heritage railway that operates between Glen Mills and West Chester on weekends. The Locksley station shelter has been restored; however, WCRR trains do not stop. A PRR historic <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> position-light signal stands near the station site. Remains of the Dyer Stone Quarry and Thorndale Mills are also visible from the station.|$|E
50|$|Automatic block {{signaling}} {{was invented}} in America, and first put to use by the Eastern Railroad of Massachusetts in 1871, and was soon adopted by other New England railroads. However, the cost of signals, equipment, and installation was very high in the 19th century, which deterred many railroads from installing it except on highly trafficked lines used by passenger trains. By 1906, the Interstate Commerce Commission reported that of the 194,726.6 miles of railroad in the United States, there were 41,916.3 miles protected by the <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> system, and only 6,826.9 miles of automatic block, on either single or double track. The rest of the nation's trackage was operated by timetable and train order.|$|E
5000|$|Automatic block signaling, or ABS, is a {{railroad}} communications system {{that consists of}} a series of signals that divide a railway line into a series of sections, or [...] "blocks". The system controls the movement of trains between the blocks using automatic signals. ABS operation is designed to allow trains operating in the same direction to follow each other in a safe manner without risk of rear end collision. The introduction of ABS reduced railways' costs and increased their capacity. Older <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> systems required human operators. The automatic operation comes from the system's ability to detect whether blocks are occupied or otherwise obstructed, and to convey that information to approaching trains. The system operates without any outside intervention, unlike more modern traffic control systems that require external control to establish a flow of traffic.|$|E

In 2000, <b>Manual</b> implemented <b>block</b> scheduling, which allowed students to take eight classes per year, which are scheduled four per day on alternating days.|$|R
50|$|The weapon {{has three}} safeties: a <b>manual</b> safety which <b>blocks</b> the trigger; an {{automatic}} safety {{on the rear}} grip which immobilizes the trigger and blocks the bolt in a closed position; and a safety on the cocking handle locking the bolt in case it does not retract sufficiently.|$|R
25|$|Bexley on Forest Road: the Old McConnachie's Paddock was {{occupied}} and first stone for the school's foundations was laid in March 1955, {{with the school}} completed and occupied by September 1956. The official opening for the school's new facilities was on 2 August 1958, with four units: the administration block, general classrooms ('A block'), <b>manual</b> training <b>block</b> and the auditorium and gymnasium. Throughout the years numerous additions {{have been made to}} the site. The School Pool was opened in 1966, the Kingston-David Library and Laboratories in 1975 and a brand-new administration block in 1998.|$|R
50|$|Aside from {{increased}} capacity and safety {{compared to a}} <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> system, another advantage of the single direction ABS system {{is that it is}} relatively inexpensive to install and operate, each signaling point requiring only one relay for its own track circuit and one additional relay for each block in its control length. Where interlockings are installed, entrance from the reverse direction may be fitted with less expensive dwarf or shunt signals and any non-interlocked points may be fitted in a trailing configuration, which require less safety equipment. Traditional ABS also has no single point of failure and no requirement to transmit state information to a central location and as long as its own track circuit is unoccupied and the inputs from the block or two down the line report the same, and ABS signal will display a clear indication.|$|E
50|$|The total {{reliance}} on manual procedures {{to ensure safety}} has occasionally resulted in train wrecks, some with fatalities, due to either miscommunication or oversight {{on the part of}} operating personnel. In 1948 the Interstate Commerce Commission set a nationwide speed limit of 60 mph for trains not protected by some kind of block system (including <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> and track warrants) and in 2012 this was expanded to include all lines considered dark territory. Since 1991 the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) had recommended that railroads be required to install new forms of signaling technology, such as positive train control (PTC), that can stop trains from exceeding their procedural authorities and warn them of improperly lined switches. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 and subsequent amendments requiring installation of PTC technology on parts of the U.S. rail network by December 31, 2018, may eliminate many sections of currently dark territory.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{particularly}} as trains became longer and faster, and railroad lines grew more congested, the banjo signal was considered to have a single and terminal flaw: visibility. The internal disc was difficult to see in foggy weather and when snow clung to the glass panel. Earlier types of electro-pneumatic semaphores made by US&S had seen some limited application by 1880 as automatic block signals. The need to maintain air pressure in the long pneumatic lines eventually led the railroads to discontinue their widespread use as automatic block signals. However, these types did see long service in interlocking plants. Early semaphores also had limited range with manual wire operation and poor reliability in bad weather. Thus some railroads continued to use disc signals where automatic block signal operation was needed between <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> stations as borne out by period rule books well into the 1920s and beyond.|$|E
50|$|Work {{began on}} {{implementing}} this strategy in 1985. The Quadrangle was refurbished {{and the following}} year an administration block was erected {{to the east of}} the Dunne Memorial <b>Block.</b> A <b>Manual</b> Arts <b>Block</b> was built in 1987 south of the South Wing. During the summer vacation of 1988-89 the Dunne Memorial Block was converted from two storeys to its present three storeys. The interior was gutted, but the form of the building and the principal facades were retained. A year eleven dormitory designed by Queensland architect Ian Ferrier was added to the Senior School during 1986.|$|R
50|$|In North American train {{order system}} was often {{implemented}} {{on top of}} other block systems when those block systems needed to be superseded. For example, where <b>manual</b> or automatic <b>block</b> was implemented, train orders {{would be used to}} authorize movements into occupied blocks, against the current of traffic or where no current of traffic was established.|$|R
50|$|The 1948 {{edition of}} the MUTCD {{introduced}} the first change to the U.S. Route shield since its appearance in the 1927 AASHO <b>manual.</b> The old <b>block</b> typefaces were replaced by the modern FHWA Series typefaces, which had since been developed. The shield shape and size, letter height, and layout was otherwise identical to the prior version.|$|R
