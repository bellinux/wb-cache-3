It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} to come here and get the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And thanks very <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>me.</b> It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|E

"I admit," [...] I answered, {{although}} I {{was trembling}} {{so much that}} I could hardly speak with steadiness, [...] "that a woman may be splendid and lovely beyond anything that the mind of man can conceive, whatever her age, of which I know nothing.

60|$|This {{does not}} mean that I turned to it with elation. I was well aware and perhaps even too much aware of the dangers of such an adventure. The amazingly {{sympathetic}} kindness which men of various temperaments, diverse views and different literary tastes <b>have</b> been <b>for</b> years displaying towards my work <b>has</b> done <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>has</b> done all--except giving me that over-weening self-confidence which may assist an adventurer sometimes {{but in the long run}} ends by leading him to the gallows.|$|R
40|$|ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS It is with {{gratitude}} and respect that I acknowledge the following {{for helping to}} make this work a success. My very deepest appreciation goes to my major advisor Stephen Schensul. I {{would also like to thank}} Penn Handwerker and Marcia Trape- Cardoso, my associate advisors. Dr. Diana Rios is <b>much</b> appreciated <b>for</b> <b>having</b> given <b>me</b> an assistantship in the Institute for Puerto Rican and Latino studies. MPH student Nitza Diaz must also be thanked for lending me professional and emotional support. Thanking Professor Cherie Ann Turpin for critiquing my writing style is important as well. My entire family deserves recognition for helping me in their individual ways. First my parents John and Gail Rose for buying three cars and my first home, while I was earning my degree. My husband Amadou for dropping off paper work, at his place of employment which was also my department. My sister Laura deserves thanks for drivin...|$|R
40|$|Harvey Locke {{grew up in}} {{southern}} Alberta. His family {{has been in the}} Bow Valley for seven generations; they were among the area’s earliest European settlers. He first visited Yellowstone in 1979, and knew intuitively there was a connection between it and the Canadian Rockies. This interest grew into helping create the Yellowstone-to-Yukon Conservation Initiative, for which he now serves as strategic advisor. He is also a program advisor to Tides Canada Foundation, based in Toronto, where he oversees the Sage Climate Project and conducts a philan-thropic consulting practice. He serves as senior advisor for conservation to the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, an advisor to the Canadian Boreal Initiative, a director emeritus of The Wildlands Project, a member of the World Commission on Protected Areas, a member of the executive committee of the Eighth World Wilder-ness Congress, and a trustee of the Eleanor Luxton Historical Foundation. He has also served as senior program officer for the environment at the Henry P. Kendall Foundation in Boston, and as president of the Alberta Liberal Party. In 1999, Time Canada magazine named him one of Canada’s leaders for the twenty-first century. Note: The text that follows is an edited transcription of Mr. Locke’s remarks at the conference.

40|$|Many of you {{may wonder}} why anyone would spend {{the better part of}} a {{life-time}} doing little more than recording from retinal ganglion cells, as I have done, so, I will give some justification for this a little bit later. Since John Robson has more sense than I, he has done a lot of other things than studied ganglion cells. However, the fact remains that it was John's interest in the behavior of retinal ganglion cells which twenty years ago caused Fergus Campbell to "ship John across the Atlantic " to Northwestern University "to dirty his fingers " with visual neurophysiology. I owe Fergus Campbell <b>much</b> gratitude <b>for</b> <b>having</b> provided <b>me</b> with the opportunity and privilege to work with John, to keep him awake during nightly experiments by giving him frequent feedings and to make life almost intoler-able for him by nagging about writing up the results. I hope that I have rendered visual sciences a small service by, in this way, having served as "supportive tissue " for John's brain. The introductory, very basic, comments on retinal ganglion cell characteristics which follow will, I hope, serve as a necessary background for John's quantitative description of cat ganglion cell behavior and also serve as a tribute to Ragnar Granit and Stephen Kuffler who laid the foundations for our knowledge of, and sub-sequent approach to, this fascinating subject...|$|R

I wonder whether any gentleman was ever before asked by another gentleman how much wine he had drank in his house, or how many dinners he had eaten. When you asked me did {{you expect me to}} pay for my dinners and wine?" [...] Sir Francis refused to make any reply to this question. [...] "And when you delicately hinted at my poverty, had you found my {{finances}} to be lower than you'd always known them? It is disagreeable to be a penniless younger brother. I have found it so all my life. And I admit that I ought to have earned my bread. It would <b>have</b> been <b>much</b> better <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>had</b> I done so. People may declare that I am good for nothing, and may hold me up as an example to be shunned. But I flatter myself that nobody <b>has</b> called <b>me</b> a blackguard. I have told no lies to injure men behind their backs;--much less have I done so to injure a woman. I have sacrificed no girl to my revenge, simply because she <b>has</b> thrown <b>me</b> over. In the little transactions I have had I have always run straight. Now I think that upon the whole I had better go before dinner, and not add anything to the bucket of claret." ...|$|R

Lejeune's film reviews {{have long}} been {{compared}} to those of Dilys Powell, who wrote for The Sunday Times <b>for</b> <b>much</b> of the period when Lejeune was writing for The Observer. Unlike Powell, Lejeune became increasingly disillusioned by various trends in films and, shortly after she had expressed her disgust at Michael Powell's film Peeping Tom, she resigned from The Observer following the release of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho in 1960. Subsequently she completed Angela Thirkell's unfinished last novel, Three Score Years and Ten (1961) and wrote an autobiography, Thank You <b>for</b> <b>Having</b> <b>Me</b> (1964).|$|R
