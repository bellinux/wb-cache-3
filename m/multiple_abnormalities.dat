50|$|Even though “scientifically {{rigorous}} {{studies of}} causes of human birth defects generally require evaluation {{of hundreds of}} birth defects or more", the CDPH's objectives were limited and largely focused on evaluating risk factors because of the fewer than dozen cases of birth defects in Kettleman City. The CDPH investigated a total of 11 eligible children born with major, structural birth defects between 2007 and March 31, 2010 to mothers {{who had lived in}} the Kettleman City area during their pregnancies. Through a mixed-methods approach consisting of interviews and supplementary medical history reports the CDPH did not find a specific cause or environmental exposure among the mother that would explain {{the increase in the number}} of children born with birth defects. It was found that some children had <b>multiple</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> while others had single defects. All the birth defects represented different underlying conditions, but a few shared some features. None of the mothers interviewed during the investigation used tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs that could cause the birth defects. Furthermore, the mothers were all in good health and did not have suspect medical histories.|$|E

50|$|Genetic {{heterogeneity}} is {{a phenomenon}} in which a single phenotype or genetic disorder {{may be caused by}} any one of a multiple number of alleles or non-allele (locus) mutations.

METHODS: The large population-based dataset of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities, 1980 - 1996. RESULTS: A total of 156 cases with unclassified <b>multiple</b> congenital <b>abnormalities</b> including microtia and anotia were analyzed according to the number of 2 - 9 component congenital abnormalities. The comparison of the distribution and frequency of component congenital abnormalities in these cases showed significant differences from the data of other unclassified <b>multiple</b> congenital <b>abnormalities.</b> Of the 156 cases, registry diagnosis was possible in 48 (30. 8 %) cases. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of available dataset of unclassified multiple anotia and microtia may help the delineation of new syndromes and associations with better prognosis and recurrence risk estimation, thus finally a better chance for their prevention...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the possible association of drug treatments in pregnant women with a higher risk of congenital abnormalities of the external ear, particularly microtia/anotia, in their children. The frequency of drug treatments was compared in the mothers of cases with isolated or <b>multiple</b> (syndromic) ear <b>abnormalities</b> and in the mothers of three different controls: controls matched to cases, all controls (these controls had no defects) and malformed controls in the population-based large dataset of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities. There was no significantly higher use of any drug in the mothers of 354 cases with isolated external ear abnormalities than in the mothers of different controls. However, of 156 cases with <b>multiple</b> ear <b>abnormalities,</b> 11 had mothers with hydroxyethylrutosidea treatment and a characteristic pattern of congenital abnormalities was found in these children. Four cases with <b>multiple</b> ear <b>abnormalities</b> were born to epileptic mothers treated with valproate, phenytoin and polytherapy in two cases. Drug treatments are not important in the origin of isolated ear abnormalities. However, a higher risk of <b>multiple</b> ear <b>abnormalities</b> was found in children born to mothers with treatment of hydroxyethylrutosidea or antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy...|$|R

40|$|Although it {{has been}} {{suspected}} {{that there is a}} decrease in semen quality over time, the results reported to date remain debatable because of methodological issues. The aim of the study reported here was to investigate the evolution of semen quality over time in a population of 1114 fertile candidates for sperm donation at CECOS, Tours, between 1976 and 2009. We investigated semen volume, sperm concentration, progressive motility, vitality, percentage of normal forms and <b>multiple</b> <b>abnormalities</b> index of the first ejaculate in this population. We did not find a decline in semen volume, whereas we observed a significant decrease in total sperm count (from 443. 2 million in 1976 to 300. 2 million in 2009), motility (from 64 % in 1976 to 49 % in 2009) and vitality (from 88 % to 80 %).
