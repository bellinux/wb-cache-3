25|$|A Wall Street Journal article {{claims that}} fresh {{investments}} in Indian organised retail will generate 10 <b>million</b> <b>new</b> <b>jobs</b> between 2012–2014, and about {{five to six}} million of them in logistics alone; even though the retail market is being opened to just 53 cities out of about 8000 towns and cities in India.|$|E
25|$|Organised {{retailers}} {{will reduce}} waste by improving logistics, creating cold storage to prevent food spoilage, improve hygiene and product safety, reduce counterfeit trade and tax evasion on expensive item purchases, and create dependable supply chains for secure {{supply of food}} staples, fruits and vegetables. They will increase choice and reduce India’s rampant inflation by reducing waste, spoilage and cutting out middlemen. Fresh investment in organised retail, the supporters of retail reform claim will generate 10 <b>million</b> <b>new</b> <b>jobs</b> by 2014, about five to six million of them in logistics alone.|$|E

Additionally, contrary to some concerns in China, post retail reforms, the number of traditional small retailers also grew by 30% over 5 years.|$|E
25|$|Supply side {{economics}} {{dominated the}} Reagan Era. During his {{eight years in}} office the national debt more than doubled, from $907 billion in 1980 to $2.6 trillion in 1988, and consumer prices rose by more than 50%. But despite cuts in income tax rates, federal income tax revenues grew from $244 billion in 1980 to $467 billion in 1990. The real median family income, which had declined during the previous administration, grew by about ten percent under Reagan. The period from 1981 to 1989 {{was among the most}} prosperous in American history, with 17 <b>million</b> <b>new</b> <b>jobs</b> created.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Global Insights {{research}} found that modern retailers such as Walmart create jobs directly, indirectly and by induced effects. In Dallas-Fort Worth {{area of the}} United States, {{with a population of}} about 2 million people, Global Insights found that Walmart alone had helped create about 6,300 new net jobs with an average salary of over $21,000 each. For India's urban population of over 400 million, an average salary of less than $2,100 per year, this scales to over 12 <b>million</b> <b>new</b> <b>jobs.</b> Other multi-brand retailers, such as Mitsukoshi of Japan, employ a much higher number of sales support employee per store, than Walmart, to suit local consumer culture. The Global Insights study also found that the modern retail such as Walmart were a key contributor in creating new net jobs and maintaining low consumer price inflation rates from 1985 to 2005.|$|E
30|$|The {{future of}} work outlook for non-OECD economies is {{similarly}} challenging. For example, in 2016, {{the unemployment rate}} in India is 5.0  % and is projected to increase to 7.5  % in 2017 [7]. Assuming 7 – 8  % annual growth and based on demographic projections, the economy will need to add over 80 <b>million</b> net <b>new</b> <b>job</b> seekers each year. At current rates only 30 <b>million</b> net <b>new</b> <b>jobs</b> – mostly informal and low-wage ones – will be created [8]. This leaves a gap of about 50 million jobs a year {{over the next ten}} years. In response to the “business-as-usual” outlook, Indian Prime Minister Modi has set some very ambitious goals, which include transforming the subcontinent into a “global manufacturing hub” [8] with the aim of creating 100 million jobs in the next six years and spurring the development of a middle class that can power the Indian economy for years to come. But the question remains: how can this shift in the national development pathway be achieved? After all, between 2005 and 2012, India’s GDP growth was 54  %, but its net job growth was only 3  % - about 15 <b>million</b> net <b>new</b> <b>jobs.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{unemployment}} problem {{ended in}} the United States {{with the beginning of}} World War II, as stepped up wartime production created <b>millions</b> of <b>new</b> <b>jobs,</b> and the draft pulled young men out.

25|$|Unemployment hit {{a low of}} 5.3% in 1988 after peaking at over 10% in 1982. Real GDP growth {{recovered}} throughout Reagan's term, averaging +3.5% per year, with a high of +7.3% in 1984. The {{average annual}} GDP growth during Reagan's presidency was the fifth highest since the Great Depression and the highest of any Republican president. Inflation decreased significantly, falling from 13.6% in 1980 to 4.1% by 1988, and 16 <b>million</b> <b>new</b> <b>jobs</b> were created. The net effect of all Reagan-era tax bills resulted in a 1% decrease of government revenues (as a percentage of GDP), with the revenue-shrinking effects of the 1981 tax cut (-3% of GDP) and the revenue-gaining effects of the 1982 tax hike (~+1% of GDP), while subsequent bills were more revenue-neutral. However, tax revenue itself nominally increased massively by 103.1% from 1981 through 1989, {{largely as a result}} of more loopholes abolished than tax rates lowered.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Congress {{passed and}} Reagan {{signed into law}} tax {{increases}} of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), Social Security, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA). Despite the fact that TEFRA was the [...] "largest peacetime tax increase in American history," [...] gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovered strongly after the early 1980s recession ended in 1982, and grew during his eight years in office {{at an annual rate}} of 7.9% per year, with a high of 12.2% growth in 1981. Unemployment peaked at 10.8% monthly rate in December 1982—higher than any time since the Great Depression—then dropped during the rest of Reagan's presidency. Sixteen <b>million</b> <b>new</b> <b>jobs</b> were created, while inflation significantly decreased. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, another bipartisan effort championed by Reagan, simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing a number of tax breaks. The top rate was dropped to 28%, but capital gains taxes were increased on those with the highest incomes from 20% to 28%. The increase of the lowest tax bracket from 11% to 15% was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption, standard deduction, and earned income tax credit. The net result was the removal of six million poor Americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2013, {{under new}} {{director-general}} Roberto Azevêdo, negotiations of the Ninth Ministerial Conference held in Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia produced {{agreement on a}} [...] "Bali Package", addressing {{a small portion of}} the Doha programme, principally bureaucratic [...] "red tape". [...] Because of the controversial nature of reforming laws on intellectual property, trade in services and subsidising crops for Food Security, the talks focused on trade facilitation, which means lowering cross-border tariffs and other regulations which impede international trade. However, there was still some controversy over this, with Cuba threatening to oppose any deal which did not affect the US embargo on Cuba. The trade facilitation measures agreed in Bali could cut the cost of shipping goods around the world by more than 10%, by one estimate, raising global output by over $400 billion a year, with benefits flowing disproportionately to poorer countries. It was claimed that the Bali Package, if implemented in full, could boost the global economy by US$1 trillion and create 21 <b>million</b> <b>new</b> <b>jobs.</b>|$|E
