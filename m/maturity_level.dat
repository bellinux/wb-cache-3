He {{was disappointed that}} {{the popularity of the}} characters that appeared in Sesame Street, including Big Bird and Bert and Ernie, had solidified a public perception his Muppets were solely intended for educating children. Henson worried he would be stuck forever working on children's television series. He felt his Muppet characters should be able to be appreciated by individuals of any <b>maturity</b> <b>level.</b> Henson told The Saturday Evening Post he had constantly dealt with others looking down upon the idea of puppet performers. He envied ventriloquist Edgar Bergen for his ability to appeal to a mature audience. Henson said he wanted to work on a program that was broadcast during the peak adult-viewing time and said he had prior difficulty persuading the major television networks to create a puppet program for mature audiences.|$|E

25|$|Resveratrol {{is found}} in highest {{concentration}} in the skins of wine grapes. The accumulation in ripe berries of different concentrations of both bound and free resveratrols depends on the <b>maturity</b> <b>level</b> and is highly variable according to the genotype. Both red and white wine grape varieties contain resveratrol, but more frequent skin contact and maceration leads to red wines normally having ten times more resveratrol than white wines. Resveratrol produced by grape vines provides defense against microbes, and production can be further artificially stimulated by ultraviolet radiation. Grapevines in cool, damp regions with higher risk of grape diseases, such as Bordeaux and Burgundy, tend to produce grapes {{with higher levels of}} resveratrol than warmer, drier wine regions such as California and Australia. Different grape varieties tend to have differing levels, with Muscadines and the Pinot family having high levels while the Cabernet family has lower levels of resveratrol. In the late 20th century interest in the possible health benefits of resveratrol in wine was spurred by discussion of the French paradox involving the health of wine drinkers in France.|$|E

2500|$|Edward Thorndike (1874–1949) {{supported}} the scientific movement in education. He based teaching practices on empirical evidence and measurement. Thorndike developed {{the theory of}} instrumental conditioning or the law of effect. [...] The law of effect states that associations are strengthened when it is followed by something pleasing and associations are weakened when followed by something not pleasing. He also found that learning is done {{a little at a}} time or in increments, learning is an automatic process and all the principles of learning apply to all mammals. Thorndike's research with Robert Woodworth on the theory of transfer found that learning one subject will only influence your ability to learn another subject if the subjects are similar. This discovery led to less emphasis on learning the classics because they found that studying the classics does not contribute to overall general intelligence. Thorndike was one of the first to say that individual differences in cognitive tasks were due to how many stimulus response patterns a person had rather than a general intellectual ability. [...] He contributed word dictionaries that were scientifically based to determine the words and definitions used. The dictionaries were the first to take into consideration the users <b>maturity</b> <b>level.</b> [...] He also integrated pictures and easier pronunciation guide into each of the definitions. Thorndike contributed arithmetic books based on learning theory. He made all the problems more realistic and relevant to what was being studied, not just to improve the general intelligence. He developed tests that were standardized to measure performance in school related subjects. His biggest contribution to testing was the CAVD intelligence test which used a multidimensional approach to intelligence and the first to use a ratio scale. His later work was on programmed instruction, mastery learning and computer-based learning: ...|$|E

50|$|Version 2 of the People CMM {{has been}} {{designed}} to correct known issues in Version 1, which was released in 1995; to add enhancements learned from five years of implementation experience; and to integrate the model better with CMMI and its IPPD extensions. The primary motivation for updating the People CMM was the error in Version 1 of placing team-building activities at <b>Maturity</b> <b>Level</b> 4. The authors made this placement based on substantial feedback that it should not be placed at <b>Maturity</b> <b>Level</b> 3, as it had been in early review releases. Experience has indicated that many organizations initiate formal development of workgroups while working toward <b>Maturity</b> <b>Level</b> 3. Thus, Version 2 of the People CMM initiates process-driven workgroup development at <b>Maturity</b> <b>Level</b> 3.

Hence, the underestimation of the convex cash outflows (leading to a lower gradient of the curve) and the overestimation of the concave cash inflows (also leading to a lower gradient of the curve) lead to a higher value of the total additional payment surplus in the optimum (optimistic case).

30|$|Tailoring the Rasch {{analysis}} for CMM development requires some slight modifications {{of the basic}} model (Lahrmann et al. 2011 : 182). Because rating scales have a stronger expressive power, five-tired Likert scales are employed instead of the originally proposed dichotomous scales. Conducting the Rasch analysis yields a single ordinal scale that represents the logit measure of each item and entity, but no distinct <b>maturity</b> <b>levels.</b> In order to avoid subjectivity in defining <b>maturity</b> <b>levels,</b> the modified Rasch analysis thus employs cluster analysis based on the item logits. Since most CMMs use five <b>maturity</b> <b>levels</b> (van Steenbergen 2011 : 90), the anticipated number of clusters is set to five.
