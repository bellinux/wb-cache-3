60|$|And it was precisely, observe, the vivacity and joy {{with which}} the <b>main</b> <b>fact</b> of Christ's life was {{accepted}} which gave the force and wrath to the controversies instantly arising about its nature.|$|E

60|$|After this manner, {{in these}} circumstances, do august Senators {{regenerate}} France. Nay, they are, in very deed, {{believed to be}} regenerating it; on account of which great fact, <b>main</b> <b>fact</b> of their history, the wearied eye can never be permitted wholly to ignore them.|$|E
60|$|But {{this would}} lead us far afield, and the <b>main</b> <b>fact</b> I {{have to point}} out to the reader is the {{transition}} of human grace and strength from the exercises of the land to those of the sea {{in the course of the}} last three centuries.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] Penelope declared. [...] "It was not necessary. I saw his face. He {{knows that}} I understand. It {{may have been}} some one else {{connected}} with the house, of course, but the <b>main</b> <b>fact</b> is beyond all doubt. Those murders were instigated, if they were not committed, by the Prince." ...|$|E

6000|$|The <b>main</b> <b>fact</b> is {{that out}} of these and similar dim {{transactions}} arose the claims of Edward I. to the over-lordship of Scotland,--claims that were urged by Queen Elizabeth's minister, Cecil, in 1568, and were boldly denied by Maitland of Lethington. From these misty pretensions came the centuries of war that made the hardy character of the folk of Scotland. {10} ...|$|E
60|$|In {{reply to}} this, I will say, {{that in my}} article I gave a brief {{synopsis}} of the subject-matter of Lady Byron's communications; and I think it must be quite evident {{to the world that}} the <b>main</b> <b>fact</b> on which the story turns was one which could not possibly be misunderstood, and the remembrance of which no lapse of time could ever weaken.|$|E
6000|$|With more {{quietness}} {{than could}} have been anticipated from so active and bustling a nature, Mrs. Langford gradually told her granddaughter all that she knew, which was but little, {{as she had been}} in attendance on her, and had only heard the <b>main</b> <b>fact</b> of Willy's story. Henrietta clapped her hands wildly together in an agony of grief. [...] "He is killed--he is, I'm sure of it!" [...] said she. [...] "Why do you not tell me so?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very {{much what}} you said. It's {{astonishing}} how people forget the vital things and remember trifles. Or perhaps as we advance from stage to stage what once seemed the vital things turn to trifles. Nothing {{can be more}} vital {{in the history of}} a man and a woman than how they became husband and wife, and yet not merely the details, but the <b>main</b> <b>fact,</b> would seem to escape record if not recollection. The next generations knows nothing of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now the Chevalier {{bona fide}} {{believed}} the man's story, {{so far as}} that he never doubted that Eustacie had perished, and he looked on Berenger's refusal to accept the tale as the mournful last clinging to a vain hope. In his eyes, the actual sight of Eustacie, and the total destruction of the house, were mere matters of embellishment, possibly untrue, but not invalidating the <b>main</b> <b>fact.</b> He only said, 'Well, my friend, I will not press you while the pain of this narration is still fresh.' ...|$|E
60|$|All was still--still and uncommonly dark. Along the {{corridor}} on which his room was situated the snores of sleeping domestics exploded, growled and twittered in the air. Every menial {{on the list}} seemed to be snoring, some in one key, some in another, some defiantly, some plaintively; but the <b>main</b> <b>fact</b> {{was that they were}} all snoring somehow, thus intimating that, so far as this side of the house was concerned, the coast might be considered clear and interruption of his plans a negligible risk.|$|E
60|$|In {{reflecting}} on the statement, thus briefly made, of the <b>main</b> <b>facts</b> connected with {{the origin of the}} coal formed during the carboniferous epoch, two or three considerations suggest themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Those are the <b>main</b> <b>facts</b> of the case, {{stripped}} of all surmise, and stated as baldly as possible. I shall now recapitulate {{what the police}} {{have done in the}} matter.|$|R
25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>facts</b> of {{his career}} were finally elucidated by Eduard Dietrich {{in a series of}} {{articles}} in the Zeitschrift für historische Theologie, which formed the basis of subsequent writings on the subject.|$|R
60|$|Now {{having read}} numberless {{newspaper}} articles on education, and even written {{a good many}} of them, and having heard deafening and indeterminate discussion going on all around me almost ever since I was born, about whether religion was part of education, about whether hygiene was an essential of education, about whether militarism was inconsistent with true education, I naturally pondered much on this recurring substantive, and I am ashamed {{to say that it was}} comparatively late in life that I saw the <b>main</b> <b>fact</b> about it.|$|E
6000|$|This quick, gallantly {{stepping}} measure {{also has}} its own kind of music, {{and the man who}} cannot feel it can never have enjoyed the sound of soldiers marching by. This, then, roughly is the <b>main</b> <b>fact</b> to remember about Browning's poetical method, or about any one's poetical method--that {{the question is not whether}} that method is the best in the world, but the question whether there are not certain things which can only be conveyed by that method. It is perfectly true, for instance, that a really lofty and lucid line of Tennyson, such as-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Bliss made {{a failure}} {{in the matter of}} getting Tom Sawyer ready on time--the {{engravers}} assisting, as usual. I went down to see how much of a delay there was going to be, and found that the man had not even put a canvasser on, or issued an advertisement yet--in fact, that the electrotypes would not all be done for a month! But of course the <b>main</b> <b>fact</b> was that no canvassing had been done--because a subscription harvest is before publication, (not after, when people have discovered how bad one's book is.) ...|$|E
60|$|You won't {{expect me}} to tell you all that, or even the little that is {{accurately}} known about that, in a quarter of an hour; yet note these <b>main</b> <b>facts</b> on the matter.|$|R
60|$|Awed into calm, Averil let him seat her beside him, {{and put her}} in {{possession}} of the <b>main</b> <b>facts</b> of the case, Minna standing by him, her hand in his, evidently understanding and feeling all that passed.|$|R
25|$|In March 2009, {{eight years}} after the {{instruction}} of the Prestige case began in the Corcubion Court, UDNG, a small independentist Galician Party, analyzed some of the <b>main</b> <b>facts</b> in the instruction as evidence of strong corruption in Spain's judicial system.|$|R
6000|$|Pitying, as {{seemed to}} be expected, the mean use to which the Baronet's faculties had been {{degraded}} on this melancholy occasion, Mr. Glossin offered to officiate as clerk or assessor, or in any {{way in which he}} could be most useful. 'And with a view to possessing you of the whole business, and in the first place, there will, I believe, be no difficulty in proving the <b>main</b> <b>fact,</b> that this was the person who fired the unhappy piece. Should he deny it, it can be proved by Mr. Hazlewood, I presume?' ...|$|E
60|$|Rumours {{had already}} got abroad {{that the little}} girl who used to show the wax-work, was the child of great people who had been stolen from her parents in infancy, and had only just been traced. Opinion was divided whether she was the {{daughter}} of a prince, a duke, an earl, a viscount, or a baron, but all agreed upon the <b>main</b> <b>fact,</b> and that the single gentleman was her father; and all bent forward to catch a glimpse, though it were only of the tip of his noble nose, as he rode away, desponding, in his four-horse chaise.|$|E
60|$|Verena knew {{people who}} dined at midday {{and others who}} dined in the evening, and others still who never dined at all; but she knew no one who dined at half-past three. Ransom's {{attachment}} to this idea therefore struck her as queer and infelicitous, and she supposed it betrayed the habits of Mississippi. But that couldn't make it any more acceptable to her, {{in spite of his}} looking so disappointed--with his dimly-glowing eyes--that he was heedless for the moment that the <b>main</b> <b>fact</b> connected with her return to Tenth Street was that she wished to go alone.|$|E
5000|$|A Fact Table {{contains}} {{expressions of}} any facts, {{each of which}} is accompanied by a number of auxiliary facts that provide additional information relevant for the <b>main</b> <b>facts.</b> Examples of auxiliary facts are: the intention, status, author, creation date, etc.|$|R

60|$|Thus, on {{the theory}} of descent with modification, the <b>main</b> <b>facts</b> {{with respect to the}} mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life {{to each other and to}} living forms, are {{explained}} in a satisfactory manner. And they are wholly inexplicable on any other view.|$|R
