40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) {{is the most}} common cause of chronic liver disease in {{developed}} countries. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of diseases, ranging from hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and liver failure. The etiology of NAFLD remains unclear but is thought to relate to increased fatty acid flux within the liver that results in toxic fatty acid metabolite production. One source of increased fatty acid flux is fructose/sucrose-induced hepatic lipogenesis. Current treatment for NAFLD encompasses dietary modifications. However, little scientific evidence exists on which to base many dietary recommendations, especially the intake of different types of carbohydrates and fats. We hypothesized that lipid mixtures of unsaturated fatty acids would inhibit lipogenesis and subsequent hepatic steatosis induced by high carbohydrate diets. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of different complex mixtures of fatty acids upon the development of fructose/sucrose-induced hepatic steatosis. METHODS: C 57 BL/ 6 mice were randomized to normocaloric chow-based diets that varied in the type of carbohydrate (starch, sucrose, fructose). Animals in each carbohydrate group were further randomized to diets that varied in lipid type (no additional lipid, soybean oil, fish <b>oil,</b> olive/soybean <b>oil,</b> <b>macadamia</b> nut <b>oil).</b> These oils were chosen based upon their content of omega- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega- 9 monounsaturated fatty acids, or omega- 7 monounsaturated fatty acids. Fatty acid flux in the liver was determine by assessing hepatic lipid content (steatosis). We also assessed fatty acid levels in the plasma and liver of the animals, hepatic lipogenesis activity, hepatic stearoyl-CoA- 1 desaturase activity, and hepatic elongase activity. RESULTS: Animals consumed similar amounts of the diets and maintained normal body weights throughout the study. Both sucrose and fructose induced hepatic lipogenesis and steatosis, with fructose being more potent. All mixed lipids similarly inhibited steatosis, limiting lipid content to levels found in the control (starch) animals. Lipogenesis and stearoyl-CoA- 1 desaturase activity were increased in the sucrose and fructose groups. Levels of these enzymatic processes remained at baseline in all of the lipid groups. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to compare various complex lipid mixtures, based upon dietary oils with different types of long-chain fatty acids, upon development of sucrose/fructose-induced steatosis. Both carbohydrate source and lipid content appear important for the modulation of steatosis. Moderate intake of complex lipids with high unsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratios inhibited both lipogenesis and steatosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which macadamia nuts accumulate the unusual palmitoleic and asclepic acyl moieties, which constitute up to 20 % of the fatty acids in some varieties, are still unknown. Acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterases (EC 3. 1. 2. 14) are intraplastidial enzymes that terminate the synthesis of fatty acids in plants and that facilitate the export of the acyl moieties to the endoplasmic reticulum {{where they can be}} used in the production of glycerolipids. Here, we have investigated the possible role of acyl-ACP thioesterase activity in the composition of <b>macadamia</b> kernel <b>oil.</b> Accordingly, two acyl-ACP thioesterases were cloned from developing macadamia kernels, one of the FatA type and the other of the FatB type. These enzymes were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant thioesterases were purified, characterized kinetically and assayed with a variety of substrates, demonstrating the high specificity of macadamia FatA towards 16 : 1 -ACP. Acyl-ACP thioesterase activity was also characterized in crude extracts from two different varieties of macadamia, Cate and Beaumont, which accumulate different amounts of n- 7 fatty acids. The impact of acyl-ACP thioesterase activities on the oil composition of these kernels is discussed in the light of these results. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the prospects of}} biodiesel production from <b>macadamia</b> <b>oil</b> as an alternative fuel for diesel engine. The biodiesel was produced using conventional transesterification process using the base catalyst (KOH). A multi-cylinder diesel engine {{was used to evaluate}} the performance and emission of 5 % (B 5) and 20 % (B 20) macadamia biodiesel fuel at different engine speeds and full load condition. It was found that the characteristics of biodiesel are within the limit of specified standards American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM D 6751) and comparable to diesel fuel. This study also found that the blending of macadamia biodiesel–diesel fuel significantly improves the fuel properties including viscosity, density (D), heating value and oxidation stability (OS). Engine performance results indicated that macadamia biodiesel fuel sample reduces brake power (BP) and increases brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) while emission results indicated that it reduces the average carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and particulate matter (PM) emissions except nitrogen oxides (NOx) than diesel fuel.

Our results showed that the percent conidia germination and growth of germ tubes and mycelia of P. macadamiae were greatest at 26 degrees C, with better conidia germination associated with high relative humidity and free water. The exposure of match-head-sized and pea-sized fruit stages to natural P. macadamiae inoculum in the field led to 2 5 -fold increases in husk spot incidence, and up to 8. 5 -fold increases in premature abscission, compared with unexposed fruit. Exposure of fruit stages later than match-head-sized and pea-sized fruit generally caused no further increases in disease incidence or premature abscission. Climatic conditions were found to have a strong influence on the behaviour of P. <b>macadamiae,</b> the host, <b>oil</b> accumulation, and the subsequent impact of husk spot on premature abscission.

40|$|A novel {{analytical}} method is developed {{to examine the}} chemical composition of plant oils by electrospray ionisation high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in both positive- and negative-ion modes. To date, {{this is the first}} reported application of this technique for the study of macadamia nut oil. Samples of macadamia nut oil from the Macadamia Integrifolia- Proteaceae family (smooth shell) are examined. The fatty acid profile of the oil is obtained by this mass spectrometric examination of the transesterified and hydrolysed oil samples. The Fourier transform ion-cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry results are compared to those obtained from similar samples using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques. High performance liquid chromatography and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry are used to separate and assign the isomers present in the methanol extract of the oils in separate experiments. Significant results in this study include: - The first observation and identity of a number of oxidised triacylglycerols in <b>macadamia</b> <b>oil</b> samples. - The first observation of oxidised and free fatty acids, measured directly in hydrolysed oil and in the methanol extract of <b>macadamia</b> <b>oil.</b> - High resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in broadband mode which enables isobars to be observed. - Esterified oil Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry results are consistent with our gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results and with the results of similar studies on <b>macadamia</b> <b>oil</b> in the literature. - A number of fatty acids with odd number of carbon atoms are observed in the oil. - In electrospray ionisation Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry of oils, the sample preparation is straightforward. The sample is dissolved in methanol or acetonitrile and the solution is introduced to the electrospray source directly. Introducing oil samples to the gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer needs the oils to be esterified prior to the analysis. - In this work, state-of-the-art mass spectrometry demonstrates distinct advantages in comparison to gas chromatography measurements such as direct identification of free fatty acids in oil samples, whereas this is not possible in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry due to the required esterification step prior to the analysis. - High performance liquid chromatography fraction collection is combined with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in off-line mode and found to improve the sensitivity, selectivity and signal to noise levels due to the lower number of compounds in each high performance liquid chromatography fraction compared to the methanol extract of <b>macadamia</b> <b>oil</b> sample.
