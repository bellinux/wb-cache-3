5|$|A white dwarf's stellar and {{planetary}} system is inherited from its progenitor star and may {{interact with the}} white dwarf in various ways. Infrared spectroscopic observations made by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope of the central star of the Helix Nebula suggest {{the presence of a}} dust cloud, which may be caused by cometary collisions. It is possible that infalling material from this may cause X-ray emission from the central star. Similarly, observations made in 2004 indicated the presence of a dust cloud around the young white dwarf G29-38 (estimated to have formed from its AGB progenitor about 500 million years ago), which may have been created by tidal disruption of a comet passing close to the white dwarf. Some estimations based on the <b>metal</b> <b>content</b> of the atmospheres of the white dwarfs consider that at least a 15% of them may be orbited by planets and/or asteroids, or at least their debris. Another suggested idea is that white dwarfs could be orbited by the stripped cores of rocky planets, that would have survived the red giant phase of their star but losing their outer layers and, given those planetary remnants would likely be made of metals, to attempt to detect them looking for the signatures of their interaction with the white dwarf's magnetic field.|$|E

40|$|Identification of {{reliable}} background values of potentially toxic metals in sediments requires detailed integration of geochemical data with accurate sedimentological studies. Through analysis of 60 soil {{samples from the}} Pisa coastal plain, this study shows to what extent sediment provenance and facies characteristics may influence the natural distribution of potentially toxic metals (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb) within alluvial and coastal sediments. Metals supplied to the alluvial plain are mostly concentrated within the finest sediment fraction (floodplain clays), while coarser crevasse and overbank deposits exhibit invariably lower <b>metal</b> <b>contents.</b> Beach-ridge sands display the lowest metal concentrations. Transport of ophiolitic detritus by the longshore drift may account for locally high Cr concentrations within beach deposits. Geochemical fingerprinting of individual facies associations in terms of natural <b>metal</b> <b>contents</b> results {{in the construction of}} a geologically-based geochemical map. This map offers a more reliable depiction of spatial distribution of background levels than interpolation techniques based uniquely upon statistical methods. Matching background values against metal concentrations from topsoil samples leads to the reliable assessment of the pollution status of Pisa coastal plain. <b>Metal</b> <b>contents</b> exceeding the threshold values designated for contaminated areas (Cr) simply reflect catchment geology, and are not the product of artificial contamination. On the other hand, anthropogenic disturbance may be detected even where <b>metal</b> <b>contents</b> (Pb, Cu) lie below the threshold values.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{increasing}} use of shallow geothermal resources, hydraulic, thermal and chemical impacts affecting groundwater quality can be observed with ever increasing frequency (Possemiers et al., 2014). To overcome the uncertainty associated with chemical impacts, a city scale study on the effects of intensive geothermal resource use by groundwater heat pump systems on groundwater quality, with special emphasis on heavy <b>metal</b> <b>contents</b> was performed. Statistical analysis of geochemical data obtained from several field campaigns has allowed studying the spatiotemporal relationship between temperature anomalies in the aquifer and trace element composition of groundwater.
