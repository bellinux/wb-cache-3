The primary objective of this proposed project is to assess whether a program of widely accessed mobile phone-based text message interventions (‘Happy Quit’) will be effective at helping people in China who smoke, to quit. Based on the efficacy of previous studies in smoking cessation, we hypothesize that ‘Happy Quit’ will be an effective, feasible and affordable smoking cessation program in China. Methods/Design In this single-blind, randomized trial, undertaken in China, about 2000 smokers willing to make a quit attempt will be randomly allocated, using an independent telephone randomization system that includes a minimization algorithm balancing for sex (male, female), age (19 – 34 or > 34  years), educational level (≤ or > 12  years), and Fagerstrom score for nicotine addiction (≤ 5, > 5), to ‘Happy Quit’, comprising motivational messages and behavioral-change support, or to a control group that receives text <b>messages</b> unrelated to <b>quitting.</b> <b>Messages</b> will be developed to be suitable for Chinese. A pilot study will be conducted before the intervention to modify the library of messages and interventions. The primary outcome will be self-reported continuous smoking abstinence. A secondary outcome will be point prevalence of abstinence. Abstinence will be assessed at six time points (4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24  weeks post-intervention).

40|$|The use {{of health}} {{messages}} aimed at persuading people to alter unhealthy habits {{is very common}} in western societies. <b>Messages</b> about <b>quitting</b> smoking, eating healthily, and practicing safe sex, for instance, are advertised through many different media channels and thereby reaching virtually everyone. Health messages remind people of the risks they take by acting unhealthily. Although most people value their health, many of them still act unhealthily. This inconsistency generates an aversive psychological state called a self-threat. In order to restore their positive self-image, people seek to reduce this selfthreat. The doctoral thesis of Suzanne Pietersma focuses on self-threats that are generated by persuasive health messages. She studied both the determinants of what generates a self-threat and the adaptive responses that are activated to reduce a selfthreat. The results of her studies show that maintaining a positive self-image is most important to people, even when this is {{at the expense of}} their own health!...|$|R

Under state health reform, Massachusetts Medicaid (MassHealth) made tobacco cessation treatment available beginning in 2006. We used surveys conducted in 2008 and 2014 to examine changes in smoking abstinence rates among MassHealth members identified as smokers and to identify factors associated with being a former smoker. Members previously identified as smokers were surveyed by mail or phone; 2008 and 2014 samples included 3, 116 and 2, 971 members, respectively. Surveys collected demographic and health information, asked members whether they smoked cigarettes "every day, some days or not at all', and asked questions to assess smoking intensity among current smokers. The 2014 survey included an open ended-question asking members "what helped the most" in quitting or quit attempts. We observed a significant decrease in members reporting smoking "every/some days" of 15. 5 percentage points (p <. 0001) from 2008 to 2014, and a significant decrease in smokers reporting smoking "more than 10 cigarettes on days smoked" of 16. 7 percentage points (p <. 0001). Compared to smokers, former smokers more frequently reported health concerns, the influence of family members, and the use of e-cigarettes as helping the most in quitting. Expanded access to tobacco cessation treatment under the Affordable Care Act may have help to reduce the high smoking rates among Medicaid enrollees.

40|$|Background: Tobacco use {{remains a}} major public health issue. Population-level efforts to curb tobacco use include media to promote smoking cessation. However, these campaigns (including tobacco package warning labels) {{commonly}} emphasize the addictiveness of nicotine {{and the difficulty of}} quitting with statements like ?nicotine is as addictive as heroin and cocaine?. Addiction oriented messages may have an iatrogenic effect on cessation by undermining behavioural precursors such as self-efficacy, cessation outcome expectations, behavioural control, and quit-aid efficacy. Objectives: First, {{to determine the effects of}} addiction focused messages in comparison to efficacy enhanced messages and control messages on smokers? self-efficacy, cessation outcome expectations, behavioural control, and quit-aid efficacy. Second, to determine if the impact of addiction focused messages differ according to participant nicotine dependency level. Methods: A sample of adult smokers (n> 101) from Kitchener/Waterloo and Owen Sound were randomly assigned into one of three intervention conditions: addiction focused (M 1), efficacy enhanced (M 2), and control (M 3). Outcome measures were collected at baseline, post intervention and 30 -day follow-up and included: self-efficacy, outcome expectations, behavioural control, quit-aid efficacy, and outcome expectancies. The 30 -day follow-up also included measures of smoking consumption, quit attempts and use of a quit-aid. Results: Majority of the participants were males and between 18 - 25 years of age. Mean number of cigarettes smoked ranged from 12 to 15 across groups whereas the mean number of years smoked ranged from 12 to 17. General linear analyses revealed no significant effect of message type or nicotine dependence (as measured by the Fagerstrome Test for Nicotine Dependence) on the outcome variables of interest. However, when perceived addiction was substituted as the measure of nicotine dependence, the analysis revealed a main effect for nicotine dependence on self-efficacy post intervention and on cessation outcome expectations at follow-up. An interaction effect was found for outcome expectancy at post intervention. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that acute addiction oriented messages may not negatively impact smokers? self-efficacy, outcomes expectations, behavioural control, quit-aid efficacy, and outcome expectancies. However, this does mean that message orientation should be ignored when constructing smoking cessation messages. In fact, program designers are encouraged to employ messages that limit the use of addiction oriented statements such as ?nicotine is as addictive as heroin and cocaine?. Further research is required to examine the potential cumulative impact of addiction oriented <b>messages</b> on <b>quitting</b> behaviour and its precursors...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{test the}} impact of three health {{messages}} focusing on vent holes, sensory effects of Light and Ultra Light cigarettes, or health consequences of smoking, respectively, on beliefs and quitting intentions.  DESIGN—In {{the course of a}} random digit dialed telephone survey, subjects were randomised to hear one of three messages. To test the effects of the <b>messages,</b> beliefs and <b>quitting</b> intentions were assessed both pre- and post-message.  PARTICIPANTS—Daily smokers (n =  2120) of Regular (46 %), Light (39 %), and Ultra Light (15 %) cigarettes in the USA. The sample was weighted to match the US smoker population on age, sex, and ethnicity.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Beliefs were summarised on three dimensions: Safety (reduced health risk), Delivery (lower tar and nicotine delivery), and Sensation (less harsh). Quitting interest was captured by the "quit index", an aggregate measure of quitting interest and intent.  RESULTS—The message focusing on smokers' sensory perceptions of Light and Ultra Light cigarettes resulted in the most positive change in beliefs about safety, delivery, and intent to quit, and was particularly effective among those who believed that these cigarettes were less harsh. The effect was most pronounced among young adults, and among smokers of Light and Ultra Light brands who most endorsed their sensory benefits.  CONCLUSIONS—Addressing smokers' sensory experience that Light and Ultra Light cigarettes feel less harsh may be a promising strategy for changing their misconceptions about these cigarettes and enhancing their interest in quitting. Media counter-advertising on Lights and Ultra Lights, focusing on sensory aspects of these cigarettes, may be an important part of tobacco control efforts.    Keywords: Light; Ultra Light; smokers' beliefs; health messages; vent hole...|$|R

The study aimed to reveal primary healthcare physicians’ (PHPs) attitude and practice towards smoking cessation brief interventions based on 3 “A’s” model. Material and Methods The study was conducted among PHPs from two cities in Armenia: Yerevan (the capital city) and Gyumri (the second largest city). We used self-administered questionnaires to evaluate the participants’ attitude and practice in providing smoking cessation based on the 3 “A’s” model. Results Overall, 108 PHPs participated in the study. Majority of participants (93. 52 %, n= 101) had positive attitude towards asking patients about smoking and 78. 22 % (n= 79) of them (74. 07 % (n= 80) of all participants) reported about always asking about the smoking status of patients. Similarly, almost all participants (99. 07 %, n= 107) {{agreed that it was}} their responsibility to routinely advise smoking patients to quit and 87. 85 % (n= 94) of them (87. 96 % (n= 95) of all participants) were always advising on quitting. Only 41. 67 % (n= 45) of the participants were always assisting patients to quit smoking. The majority (57. 41 %, n= 62) did not provide assistance in their practices despite their positive attitude (99. 07 %, n= 107). Conclusions Although having favorable attitude towards asking, advising and assisting patients to quit smoking, PHPs did not fully implement smoking cessation brief interventions in daily practice. Further research is needed to identify barriers that hinder PHPs from transferring their positive attitude towards helpingsmoking patients into practice.

40|$|Abstract Background Smoking {{is still}} {{the leading cause of}} {{preventable}} ill health and death. There is a limited amount of evidence for effective smoking cessation interventions among young people. To address this, a text messaging-based smoking cessation programme, the NEXit intervention, was developed. Short-term effectiveness, measured immediately after the 12 -week intervention revealed that 26 % of smokers in the intervention group had prolonged abstinence compared with 15 % in the control group. The present study was performed to explore the users’ experiences of the structure and content of the intervention in order to further develop the intervention. Methods Students participating in the main NEXit randomized controlled trial were invited to grade their experiences of the structure and content of the intervention after having completed follow-up. The participants received an e-mail with an electronic link to a short questionnaire. Descriptive analysis of the distribution of the responses to the questionnaire was performed. Free-text comments to 14 questions were analysed. Results The response rate for the user feedback questionnaire was 35 % (n[*]=[*] 289 / 827) and 428 free-text comments were collected. The first motivational phase of the intervention was appreciated by 55 % (158 / 289) of the participants. Most participants wanted to quit smoking immediately and only 124 / 289 (43 %) agreed to have to decide a quit-date in the future. Most participants 199 / 289 (69 %) found the content of the messages in the core programme to be very good or good, and the variability between content types was appreciated by 78 % (224 / 289). Only 34 % (97 / 289) of the participants thought that all or nearly all messages were valuable, and some mentioned that it was not really the content that mattered, but that the messages served as a reminder about the decision to quit smoking.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundSmoking {{cessation}} programmes delivered via {{mobile phone}} text messaging show increases in self-reported quitting {{in the short}} term. We assessed the effect of an automated smoking cessation programme delivered via mobile phone text messaging on continuous abstinence, which was biochemically verified at 6 months. MethodsIn this single-blind, randomised trial, undertaken in the UK, smokers willing to make a quit attempt were randomly allocated, using an independent telephone randomisation system, to a mobile phone text messaging smoking cessation programme (txt 2 stop), comprising motivational messages and behavioural-change support, or to a control group that received text <b>messages</b> unrelated to <b>quitting.</b> The system automatically generated intervention or control group texts according to the allocation. Outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was self-reported continuous smoking abstinence, biochemically verified at 6 months. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN 80978588. FindingsWe assessed 11   914 participants for eligibility. 5800 participants were randomised, of whom 2915 smokers were allocated to the txt 2 stop intervention and 2885 were allocated to the control group; eight were excluded because they were randomised more than once. Primary outcome data were available for 5524 (95 %) participants. Biochemically verified continuous abstinence at 6 months was significantly increased in the txt 2 stop group (10 · 7 % txt 2 stop vs 4 · 9 % control, relative risk [RR] 2 · 20, 95 % CI 1 · 80 – 2 · 68; p< 0 · 0001). Similar results were obtained when participants that were lost to follow-up were treated as smokers (268 [9 %] of 2911 txt 2 stop vs 124 [4 %] of 2881 control [RR 2 · 14, 95 % CI 1 · 74 – 2 · 63; p< 0 · 0001]), {{and when they were}} excluded (268 [10 %] of 2735 txt 2 stop vs 124 [4 %] of 2789 control [2 · 20, 1 · 79 – 2 · 71; p< 0 · 0001]). No significant heterogeneity was shown in any of the prespecified subgroups. InterpretationThe txt 2 stop smoking cessation programme significantly improved smoking cessation rates at 6 months and should be considered for inclusion in smoking cessation services.
