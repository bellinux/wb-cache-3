5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for.

50|$|Studies show a {{link between}} HPV {{infection}} and penile and anal cancers. Sexually transmitted HPVs are found in {{a large percentage of}} anal cancers. Moreover, the risk for anal cancer is 17 to 31 times higher among gay and bisexual men than among heterosexual men - though one survey did not find a difference between the HPV infection rate of <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with <b>men</b> versus those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> only with women.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protozoa}} can cause gastroenteritis – most commonly Giardia lamblia – but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., {{and other species}} have also been implicated. As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this etiologic agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men, and following disasters.|$|E
5|$|Antiretroviral {{treatment}} {{among people}} with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP). TASP {{is associated with a}} 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa. It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100personyears.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men, reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, {{with the possible exception}} of syphilis.|$|E
50|$|The {{service has}} {{a policy of}} barring <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with <b>men</b> (MSM) during the {{previous}} twelve months from donating blood (an earlier policy <b>had</b> excluded any <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with other men since 1980, regardless of time elapsed).

People <b>who</b> <b>have</b> engaged in heterosexual or female-to-female sex during the past 12 months are allowed to give blood. Female-to-female transmission is considered by the Centers for Disease Control to be rare.

25|$|Unlike {{prostitution}} and drug use, homosexuality {{has never been}} banned in China, but it was listed as a psychiatric disorder until 2001, and public acts of homosexual sex are punishable as hooliganism. Although increasingly tolerated in the cities, in general, homosexuality is highly stigmatised and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men are under considerable pressure to conceal their sexual orientation. As a result, most homosexuals are married, or {{will be in the}} future, and form a bridge between the high-risk <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men group to their low-risk wives and other partners. The government has initiated few interventions for <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men, leaving such programmes to advocacy groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and researchers. However, the government recently estimated that there were 5–10 million <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men living in China, of whom 1.35% are thought to be HIV positive. This information, in addition to studies indicating low levels of HIV knowledge, perceived risk, and testing, and high rates of sexually transmitted diseases, has prompted the Ministry of Health to now include <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men in the high-risk groups and to call for the development of novel interventions to target them.|$|E

25|$|The {{term was}} created in the 1990s by epidemiologists to study the spread of disease among <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men, {{regardless}} of identity.

25|$|<b>Men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men {{may also}} prefer {{to engage in}} frot {{or other forms of}} mutual {{masturbation}} because they find it more pleasurable or more affectionate, to preserve technical virginity, or as safe sex alternatives to anal sex, while other frot advocates denounce anal sex as degrading to the receptive partner and unnecessarily risky.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in {{understanding}} the extent of an epidemic was {{to be able to}} identify cases. National sentinel surveillance has been implemented since 1995, but was initially restricted to high-risk areas and to attendees at sexually transmitted disease clinics, female sex workers, drug users, and long-distance truck drivers. Surveillance has gradually been expanded to 845 national sites and now also includes pregnant women and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men.|$|E

40|$|In fact, {{they are}} among the groups <b>who</b> <b>have</b> the highest {{prevalence}} of HIV infection (Davies et al., 2007; Parrado, Flippen, & McQuiston, 2004). Since the early epidemic of HIV/AIDS, several studies examined the characteristics of female CSWs and their sexual behaviors, knowledge, and practice in the prevention of STIs and HIV to determine their role in the transmission and prevalence of the disease (Downe, 1997; Elifson, Boles, Darrow, & Sterk, 1999; Ryan et al., 1998). Nonetheless, the under-standing of their clients, the <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with female CSWs, is very limited, particularly in a coun-try where HIV/AIDS is an epidemic. Previous studies have estimated the risk of transmission between female CSWs and their male clients and the risk of transmission between these men and their spouses or regular cohabiting partners (Johnson & Way, 2006; Ward et al., 2005). Understanding the sociodemo-graphic characteristics, sexual behaviors, attitude, and practice of <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with CSWs will help in better understanding the dynamics of trans-mission of STIs and HIV among higher-risk popula-tions and contribute to the control of the HIV/AIDS epidemic...|$|R
50|$|A self-selected study {{limited to}} <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with other <b>men,</b> used meth, and {{attended}} CMA, showed that, {{after three months}} of participation in CMA, participants reported their number of sexual partners had fallen from seven to less than one, and self-reports of unprotected anal intercourse when using methamphetamine fell by two-thirds.

25|$|Gay men {{who prefer}} anal sex may {{view it as}} their version of {{intercourse}} and a natural expression of intimacy {{that is capable of}} providing pleasure. The notion that it might resonate with gay men with the same emotional significance that vaginal sex resonates with heterosexuals has also been considered. Some <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men, however, believe that being a receptive partner during anal sex questions their masculinity.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 1968, the GDR adopted its own code of {{criminal}} law.

5000|$|The third {{surviving}} law concerning moicheia protected {{an accused}} adulterer from illegal imprisonment.

2500|$|A 1989 {{study found}} {{a very high}} number of {{partners}} (over 100) to be present though rare among homosexual males.

OkCupid discovered a similar pattern in the data collected from its vast number of users, published in 2010: the median number of self-reported lifetime sexual partners for both gay and straight men was six; however, a small minority of gay men (2%) were having a disproportionate share of all self-reported gay sex (23%). According to updated OkCupid data published in 2014, gay male users self-reported a lower median of lifetime sex partners than straight male users: four for gay men and five for straight men. A 2007 study reported that two large population surveys found [...] "the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women." ...|$|R
