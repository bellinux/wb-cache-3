5|$|The story I {{am going}} to tell is a horrible one: I beg that daughters and fathers should hold {{themselves}} aloof, while I sing, or if they find <b>my</b> <b>songs</b> enchanting, let them refuse to believe this part of my tale, and suppose that it never happened: or else, if they believe that it did happen, they must believe also in the punishment that followed.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into <b>my</b> <b>songs</b> wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

25|$|I guess I {{just wanted}} this album to {{be a lot}} about me and all the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre.

There {{were a lot of}} tracks, though, where I played bass... because what Paul would do—if he'd written a song, he'd learn all the parts for Paul and then come in the studio and say (sometimes he was very difficult): 'Do this'. He'd never give you the opportunity to come out with something." ...|$|E

I thought if it could be a single that it would be incredible to perform it all the time ... What stands out about the song [...] I can dance to it and rock out to it, which is ultimately my goal. I was just so excited when I heard this one, 'cause it's the epitome of where I want to go with the future.|$|E

[...] Eventually {{discovered}} that there were folk clubs where people were actually listening, and not drinking and carousing while you played. [...] I got involved in that circuit.

[...] The single was recorded on September 26, 2008, and was exclusively uploaded to iTunes on October 8 before it was available to other digital distribution platforms two weeks later.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} promote the album, Carey {{embarked}} on her second head-lining tour. Originally she was against touring due to the long travel times and hassle, but obliged due to fan request. The tour reached Japan and select European countries, not visiting the United States. This was possibly due to the mixed reception Carey's 1993 North American Music Box Tour received three years prior. The shows were all spaced apart, giving Carey time to rest her vocals, [...] "It's very strenuous to sing all <b>my</b> <b>songs</b> back to back, but I'm actually {{really looking forward to}} it." [...] Before embarking on her world tour in 1996, Carey performed a sold-out show at Madison Square Garden in 1995.

It gives me the freedom to sing as powerfully as I want and to rewrite the songs specifically for the genre." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, who was critical of the song's original version, praised the [...] "Vintage Throwback Remix". He felt it was more of what the original [...] "should have been" [...] and concluded: [...] "a rousing vocal arrangement at the song's climax sells Mariah's inspirational message of perseverance and harks back to her '90s heyday." [...] Idolator's Becky Bain called the remix far more [...] "captivating" [...] than the original, and felt its re-recorded vocals showcased the singer's [...] "one-of-a-kind range." ...|$|E
500|$|Silver himself {{commented that}} {{inspiration}} came from multiple sources: [...] "I'm inspired by nature and {{by some of}} the people I meet and some of the events that take place in my life.

Others I get from just doodlin' around on the piano". He also wrote that, [...] "when I wake up with a melody in my head, I jump right out of bed before I forget it and run to the piano and my tape recorder. I play the melody with my right hand and then harmonize it with my left. I put it down on my tape recorder, and then I work on getting a bridge or eightbar release for the tune." ...|$|E

500|$|Björk {{chose the}} title Post for two reasons. Firstly, {{it refers to}} the fact that all the songs on the album were written after her move to England, while the songs on Debut were songs she had written during the {{previous}} ten years of her life in Iceland. In a 1996 interview, Björk said: [...] "I always knew it would be two albums and that's why I called them Debut and Post. Before and after". Secondly, the title was inspired by the singer's desire to communicate with friends and family back in Iceland, giving Post the additional meaning of [...] "mail". Talking with Raw in 1996, Björk stated: [...] "I called the record Post, because I always address <b>my</b> <b>songs</b> back in my head to Iceland in a letter. Because it was such a big jump for me to move away from all my relatives, all my friends, everything I know".|$|E
500|$|By 1973, Sellers and Milligan {{were among}} the comedians who formed part of Harrison's social circle at his Friar Park estate in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. This period coincided {{with the end of}} his {{marriage}} to Pattie Boyd, who has described their home as [...] "a madhouse" [...] during their final year together. Harrison became reacquainted with Smith through longtime Beatles aide Terry Doran. Harrison admired Smith as [...] "a wonderfully eccentric person", a quality that had similarly inspired him about Sir Frank Crisp, the original owner of Friar Park. Author Dale Allison suggests that Smith became a court jester figure for Harrison, who wrote the song [...] "His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)" [...] as a tribute to Smith. In his autobiography, Harrison terms the composition [...] "a piece of personal indulgence, like some other of <b>my</b> <b>songs</b> about things nobody else knows or cares about, except maybe two people".|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 1898 Dresser {{reported}} that nearly one million copies of sheet music would soon be sold, making [...] "Wabash" [...] a [...] "sensation", the [...] "great hit of the day."

You see I am a publisher {{as well as a}} composer and have a big printing house of my own in New York. I also write the words for all <b>my</b> <b>songs,</b> dictate the circumstances and stage settings for their public introductions, write my own ads, and sometimes sing my own songs. Now {{what do you think of}} that for a monopoly. Eh?" [...] Dresser earned a substantial income from the song, including royalties through the sale of sheet music.|$|E
