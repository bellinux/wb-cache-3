5|$|On 5 November, TPD was {{formally}} liquidated at a creditors' meeting. It was revealed, to {{the anger of}} the creditors, that Sinclair had taken out a £5 million debenture to cover the <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had put into the company. Ordinary creditors faced little prospect of recovering the £1 million left outstanding. Primary Contact, the marketing agency used by Sinclair to promote the C5, was left with the biggest unpaid bill, of nearly £500,000. The last of the unsold C5s were bought for £75 each by Ellar (Surplus Goods) Ltd of Liverpool, which planned to sell 1,000 of them to an Egyptian businessman for use on a university campus while another 1,500 were intended to be sold in the UK.|$|E

25|$|Until he was {{approached}} by TV Guide in December 1994, Ellison did not discuss the issues with the episode in print other than the introduction in Six Science Fiction Plays.

25|$|In 1916, Stout {{tired of}} writing a story {{whenever}} he needed money. He decided to stop writing until he had made enough money to support himself through other means, {{so that he would}} be able to write when and as he pleased. He wrote no fiction for more than a decade, until the late 1920s, when he had saved substantial money through his school banking system. Ironically, just as Stout was starting to write fiction again, he lost most of the <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had made as a businessman in the Depression of 1929.|$|E

However, there's a catch: they can never fall in love.

25|$|Hogg did {{not express}} much admiration for Shelley's poetry in the book. Many readers {{inferred}} from {{his description of}} Shelley that Hogg viewed him as a lady's man who was often irresponsible. Another irritation to many was that Hogg often boasted about himself in the book. He attempted to present himself as a sober and serious friend to an often foolish Percy Shelley. The book contained many descriptions of Shelley breaking appointments, borrowing <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not repay, and fabricating odd stories. Hogg {{did not mention the}} atheism that he shared with Percy Shelley, fearing the effect that this disclosure could have on his reputation. He went to great lengths in the book to portray himself as conservative and loyal to the traditions of England.|$|E

25|$|When the {{ambulance}} arrived, medics determined Landau and Rosencrantz {{were the most}} seriously wounded {{of the men and}} took to the hospital immediately. A second ambulance was called for to take Schultz and Berman. Berman was unconscious, but Schultz was drifting in and out of lucidity, as police attempted to comfort him and get information. Because the medics had no pain relievers, Schultz was given brandy to relieve his suffering. When the second ambulance arrived, Schultz gave one of the medics $10,000 in cash to see that he received the best treatment. After surgery, when it looked as if Schultz would live, the medic was so worried that he would be indebted to the mobster for keeping the <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> shoved the money back in bed with Schultz.|$|E
25|$|The general {{election}} of July 1895 was disastrous for the Liberals, and the Conservatives under Lord Salisbury won {{a majority of}} 152. With no government post, Asquith divided his time between politics {{and a return to}} his law practice. Jenkins comments that in this period Asquith earned a substantial, though not stellar, income and was never worse off and often much higher-paid than when in office. Matthew writes that his income as a QC in the following years was around £5,000 to £10,000 per annum (around £500,000–£1,000,000 at 2015 prices). According to Haldane, on returning to government in 1905 Asquith had to give up a £10,000 brief to act for the Khedive of Egypt. Margot later claimed (in the 1920s, when they were short of <b>money)</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could have made £50,000 per annum had he remained at the bar.|$|E
25|$|In September 1934, Malden {{decided to}} leave his home in Gary, Indiana, to pursue formal {{dramatic}} training at the Goodman School (later part of DePaul University), then associated with the Goodman Theater in Chicago. Although he {{had worked in the}} steel mills in Gary for three years, he had helped support his family and was consequently unable to save enough money to pay for his schooling. Making a deal with the director of the program, he gave the institute the little <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did have, with the director agreeing that, if Malden did well, he would be rewarded with a full scholarship. He won the scholarship. When Malden performed in the Goodman's children's theater, he wooed the actress Mona Greenberg (stage name: Mona Graham), who married him in 1938. He graduated from the Chicago Art Institute in 1937. Soon after, without work and without money, Malden returned to his hometown.|$|E
