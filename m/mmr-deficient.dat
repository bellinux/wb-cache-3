40|$|Mismatch repair (MMR) {{deficiency}} {{represents a}} well-established cause ofLynch syndrome, {{which is an}} autosomal dominantly inherited disorder of cancer susceptibility triggered by loss-of-function mutations in MMR genes (MLH 1, MSH 2, MSH 6 or PMS 2). (URL:#_ENREF_ 1) Lynch syndrome is responsible for 2 - 5 % of endometrial (EM) or colorectal (CRC) tumors. Additionally, epigenetic silencing of MLH 1 contributes to another 15 - 28 % of these tumors. (URL:#_ENREF_ 2) Deficiency of the MMR machinery leads to DNA replicationerrors in the tumor tissue, {{but not in the}} normal surrounding tissue. In particular, errors often accumulate as insertion/deletion (indel) mutations in mono- and di-nucleotide repeats - a phenomenon referred to as microsatellite instability (MSI). (URL:#_ENREF_ 3) <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors constitute a specific subtype due to their different prognosis and clinical outcome. (URL:#_ENREF_ 4) For instance, untreated CRC cancer patients with <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors have a modestly better prognosis, but do not seem to benefit from 5 -fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy, which is the first-choice chemotherapy for CRC cancer. In particular, in <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors, mismatches induced by 5 -fluorouracil are tolerated, leading to failure to induce cell death. (URL:#_ENREF_ 5) <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors are also resistant to cisplatin and carboplatin, which are frequently used chemotherapies in EM cancer. (URL:#_ENREF_ 5) Furthermore, <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors can be resistant to targeted therapies, because they acquire secondary mutations in genes that activate alternative or downstream signaling pathways (e. g. PIK 3 CA). Another possibility is that epigenetic silencing of MLH 1 coincides with particular mutations, such as the BRAF V 600 E mutation(URL:#_ENREF_ 6), which represents an established negative predictor of response to targeted anti-EGFR therapies in advanced CRC cancer. (URL:#_ENREF_ 7) There have been some efforts to individualize the treatment of <b>MMR-deficient</b> cancers. These focused on identifying synthetic lethal interactions with the MMR pathway or targeting secondary mutations occurring as a result of MMR-deficiency. However, until now, these efforts failed to translate into clinically effective treatment options. The objectives of this thesis were to generate a more comprehensive picture of the mutation spectra arising in <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors and to more rationally predict their response to therapies. Firstly, whole-exome sequencing was applied to characterize the unique somatic mutation patterns underlying <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors. Each <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumor exhibited a clear hypermutator phenotype, containing on average 50 times more novel somatic mutations than MMR-proficient tumors. The mutations in <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors were mostly occurring as indels in homopolymers. Indels were clearly less frequent in exons, suggesting that they are loss-of-function mutations undergoing negative clonal selection during tumorigenesis. On the other hand, a large set of recurrent indels affecting <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors was identified implying positive clonal selection. Secondly, a novel MSI panel was designed to detect MMR-deficiency in clinical tumor samples by high-throughput profiling of the selected recurrent indels. This Sequenom-based panel was tested on more than 400 tumor samples, fromendometrial, colorectal and ovarian cancer patients, and demonstrated that it outperforms the standard diagnostic panel (i. e. the revised Bethesda panel). Thirdly, pathway analyses revealed that the recurrent indels in <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors preferentiallyaffect the DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) by homologous recombination (HR)  pathway, containing on average 3. 3 indels per tumor. The biological relevance of these secondary mutations was validated by performing functional studies in 11 primary tumor cultures. Double immunostaining for γH 2 AX and RAD 51, as a measure of DSBs and ongoing HR, respectively, showed that <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors mobilized less RAD 51 -positive foci, after DSB formation. BrdU and PI cell cycle analysis using FACS, as well as Western blots were used to exclude a reduced S/G 2 phase or a reduced RAD 51 expression as confounding factors for areduced DSBR by HR activity. Thereby, it is confirmed that the DSBR by HR pathway is also functionally affected in <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors. Moreover, DSB inducers, such as the PARP inhibitor olaparib, triggered a dose-dependent reduction in proliferation in primary cultures of <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors, identifying a synthetic lethal interaction. In addition, to more accurately measure the level of HR-deficiency in <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors, the level of knock-down of BRCA 1, BRCA 2 and ATR needed to achieve an olaparib sensitivity similar to that observed in <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells was assessed. It is established that the loss of DSBR by HR activity in <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors corresponds to a loss of about 70 - 80 % BRCA 1 or - 2 expression, indicating that the sensitivity to olaparib that is observed in <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors is intermediateto that of cells heterozygous and homozygous-deficient for BRCA 1. Insummary, this thesis not only provides the first comprehensive catalogue of somatic mutations accumulating in <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors, but also demonstrates the relevance of these mutations in the detection of MSI within the diagnostic setting, and potentially also the targeted treatment of these tumors. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Deficiencies in the {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) pathway have been assocd. with various cancers, and many commonly used chemotherapeutics have decreased effectiveness against <b>MMR-deficient</b> cancers. There is consequently {{a need for}} chemotherapies that selectively target <b>MMR-deficient</b> cancer cells. Research in our lab. has uncovered a class of compds., rhodium metalloinsertors, that selectively binds to DNA mismatches with high affinity and specificity. These rhodium metalloinsertors bear an expansive arom. chrysi ligand (chrysi= chrysene- 5, 6 -quinonediimine) which, upon mismatch binding, inserts into the DNA duplex from the minor groove and ejects {{the mismatch}}ed bases. These metalloinsertors exhibit selective cytotoxicity, preferentially inducing necrosis in <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells over MMR-proficient cells.

40|$|Mismatch repair (MMR) {{has been}} shown to control {{homologous}} recombination (HR) by aborting strand exchange between divergent sequences. We previously demonstrated that <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumour cells are more resistant to chromosomal damage induced by bleomycin (BLM) during the G(2) phase, likely {{due to the lack of}} the MMR inhibitory effect on HR. Aim of this study was to investigate whether inhibition of HR by the nucleoside analogue BVDU [(E) - 5 (2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxyuridine, brivudin], or silencing of genes involved in HR function, might affect sensitivity of <b>MMR-deficient</b> turnout cells to DNA damage induced by BLM in G(2). The results indicated that BVDU increased chromatid damage and DNA double strand breaks induced by BLM only in <b>MMR-deficient</b> MT- 1, HL- 60 R, HCT 116 cells, which are more resistant to BLM with respect to MMR-proficient TK- 6, HL- 60 S and HCT 116 / 3 - 6 lines. Silencing of RAD 51,a key component of HR, increased sensitivity of <b>MMR-deficient</b> HCT- 15 cells to BLM clastogenicity; in this case combined treatment with BVDU had no additional effect. Similarly, treatment with BVDU did not affect BLM clastogenicity, in CAPAN- 1 cells, characterized by a defective HR due to BRCA 2 mutations. Conversely, BVDU increased chromatid breaks induced by BLM in HCT- 15 cells transiently silenced for DNA-PK catalytic subunit, which plays a key role in non-homologous end joining. The BVDU-mediated increase of chromatid breaks in <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells did not depend on its previously reported inhibitory effect on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). In fact, it was observed also in cells stably silenced for PARP- 1, which is responsible for most of cellular PARP activity. These data support the suggestion that the higher sensitivity of MMR-proficient versus <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells to BLM-induced chromatid breaks in the G(2) phase is a consequence of the inhibition of HR by MMR. In <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells, BVDU attenuates the repair of BLM-induced DSBs and this is likely to occur via inhibition of HR. (c) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The DNA {{mismatch}} repair system (MMR) maintains genome stability through recognition and repair of single-base mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops.

Toward this goal, we generated isogenic cancer cell lines for direct comparison of MMR-proficient and <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells. We engineered NCI-H 23 lung adenocarcinoma cells to contain a doxycycline-inducible shRNA designed to suppress the expression of the {{mismatch repair}} gene MLH 1, and compared single cell subclones that were uninduced (MLH 1 -proficient) versus induced for the MLH 1 shRNA (MLH 1 -deficient).

Recently, <b>MMR-deficient</b> crypt foci (MMR-DCF) {{have been identified as}} a novel lesion which occurs at high frequency in the intestinal mucosa from Lynch syndrome mutation carriers, but very rarely progress to cancer. To shed light on molecular alterations and clinical associations of MMR-DCF, we systematically searched the intestinal mucosa from Lynch syndrome patients for MMR-DCF by immunohistochemistry. The identified lesions were characterised for alterations in microsatellite-bearing genes with proven or suspected role in malignant transformation. We demonstrate that the prevalence of MMR-DCF (mean 0. 84 MMR-DCF per 1 cm 2 mucosa in the colorectum of Lynch syndrome patients) was significantly associated with patients' age, but not with patients' gender. No MMR-DCF were detectable in the mucosa of patients with sporadic MSI-H colorectal cancer (n = 12). Microsatellite instability of at least one tested marker was detected in 89 % of the MMR-DCF examined, indicating an immediate onset of microsatellite instability after MMR gene inactivation. Coding microsatellite mutations were most frequent in the genes HT 001 (ASTE 1) with 33 %, followed by AIM 2 (17 %) and BAX (10 %). Though MMR deficiency alone appears to be insufficient for malignant transformation, it leads to measurable microsatellite instability even in single <b>MMR-deficient</b> crypts. Our data indicate {{for the first time that}} the frequency of MMR-DCF increases with patients' age. Similar patterns of coding microsatellite instability in MMR-DCF and <b>MMR-deficient</b> cancers suggest that certain combinations of coding microsatellite mutations, including mutations of the HT 001, AIM 2 and BAX gene, may contribute to the progression of <b>MMR-deficient</b> lesions into <b>MMR-deficient</b> cancers...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{has been}} {{exploited}} as a biological target of chemotherapeutics since the 1940 s. Traditional chemotherapeutics, such as cisplatin and DNA-alkylating agents, rely primarily on increased uptake by rapidly proliferating cancer cells for therapeutic effects, but this strategy can result in off-target toxicity in healthy tissue. Recently, research interests have shifted towards targeted chemotherapeutics, in which a drug targets a specific biological signature of cancer, resulting in selective toxicity towards cancerous cells. Here, we review a family of complexes, termed rhodium metalloinsertors, that selectively target DNA base pair mismatches, a hallmark of mismatch repair (MMR) -deficient cancers. These rhodium metalloinsertors bind DNA mismatches with high specificity and display high selectively in killing <b>MMR-deficient</b> versus MMR-proficient cells. This cell selectivity is unique among small molecules that bind DNA. Current generations of rhodium metalloinsertors have shown nanomolar potency along with high selectivity towards <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells, and show promise {{as a foundation for}} a new family of chemotherapeutics for <b>MMR-deficient</b> cancers...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{replication}} {{errors that}} persist as mismatch mutations {{make up the}} molecular fingerprint of mismatch repair (MMR) -deficient tumors and convey them with resistance to standard therapy. Using whole-genome and -exome sequencing, we here confirm an <b>MMR-deficient</b> mutation signature that is distinct from other tumor genomes, but surprisingly similar to germ-line DNA, confirming that a substantial fraction of human genetic variation arises through mutations escaping MMR. Moreover, we identify a large set of recurrent indels that may serve to detect microsatellite instability (MSI). Indeed, using endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically-proven MMR deficiency, we optimize a novel marker set capable of detecting MSI and show it to have greater specificity and selectivity than standard MSI tests. Additionally, we show that recurrent indels are enriched for the 'DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination' pathway.

40|$|The DNA {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) pathway recognizes and repairs errors in base pairing and acts to maintain genome stability. Cancers {{that have lost}} MMR function are common and comprise an important clinical subtype that is resistant to many standard of care chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin. We have identified a family of rhodium metalloinsertors that bind DNA mismatches with high specificity and are preferentially cytotoxic to <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells. Here, we characterize the cellular mechanism of action of the most potent and selective complex in this family, [Rh(chrysi) (phen) (PPO) ]^(2 +) (Rh-PPO). We find that Rh-PPO binding induces a lesion that triggers the DNA damage response (DDR). DDR activation results in cell-cycle blockade and inhibition of DNA replication and transcription. Significantly, the lesion induced by Rh-PPO is not repaired in <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells, resulting in selective cytotoxicity. The Rh-PPO mechanism is reminiscent of DNA repair enzymes that displace mismatched bases, and is differentiated from other DNA-targeted chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin by its potency, cellular mechanism, and selectivity for <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells...|$|E

Our aim was to characterize the transcriptional profile of this colon cancer subset. METHODS: An oligonucleotide microarray containing 12, 625 probes {{was used to evaluate}} gene expression in 25 proximal colon cancers, 10 samples of normal colon mucosa, and 14 colon cancer cell lines. Transcriptional profiles of <b>MMR-deficient</b> cancers and cell lines were compared with those of their MMR-proficient counterparts. RESULTS: Unsupervised analysis of microarray data showed that MMR status exerts a predominant influence on the gene expression profile of proximal colon cancers. Hierarchical clustering divided the cancers into 2 groups corresponding almost perfectly with their MMR status. Supervised analysis identified numerous gene expression changes that represent a genetic signature of <b>MMR-deficient</b> colon cancers. Changes in genes involved in apoptosis and the immune response were consistent with the better prognosis of <b>MMR-deficient</b> cancers. In <b>MMR-deficient</b> cancers and cell lines, 4 - 1 BBL, a crucial gene in the anti-tumor immune response, was, respectively, 2. 4 and 6. 0 times more expressed than in their MMR-proficient counterparts. This difference was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometric assessment of 4 - 1 BBL protein expression in colon cancer cell lines. Our analysis also showed novel possible gene targets of microsatellite instability.

40|$|Loss of a {{functional}} mismatch repair (MMR) system in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells {{is associated with}} microsatellite instability and increased sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. In this study, we have investigated whether a defect in double-strand break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) could explain why <b>MMR-deficient</b> CRC cells are hypersensitive to camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase I inhibitor. To evaluate the efficiency and the fidelity of DSB repair, we have transiently transfected plasmids containing cohesive or non-complementary ends in cells with various MMR defects. We have observed that the repair efficiency of DSB with cohesive and non-complementary ends is comparable in all cell lines. In contrast to the MMR-proficient cell line HT 29, the <b>MMR-deficient</b> cell lines were highly accurate in repairing DSB with cohesive ends, but this characteristic could not be directly assigned to the primary MMR deficiency. Furthermore, CPT treatment had no detectable effect on the repair of cohesive ends but significantly decreased the repair efficiency of non-complementary DSB. In conclusion, although our observations show that DSB repair efficiency by NHEJ decreases upon treatment with CPT, which possibly contributes to its cytotoxicity, it is quite unlikely that it accounts for the hypersensitivity of <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells to topoisomerase inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Loss of {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) {{leads to a}} complex mutator phenotype that appears to drive {{the development of a}} subset of colon cancers. Here we show that <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumour cell lines are highly sensitive to the toxic effects of thymidine relative to MMR-proficient lines. This sensitivity was not a direct consequence of MMR deficiency or alterations of DNA precursor metabolism. Instead, MMR-defective tumour cell lines are also defective in homologous recombination repair (HRR) induced by DNA double-strand breaks. Furthermore, a frameshift mutation of the human RAD 51 paralog XRCC 2 found in the <b>MMR-deficient</b> uterine tumour cell line SKUT- 1 can confer thymidine sensitivity when introduced into a MMR-proficient line. Like other cells with defective XRCC 2, SKUT- 1 is sensitive to mitomycin C, and MMR-proficient cells expressing the mutant XRCC 2 allele become more sensitive to this agent. These data suggest that the thymidine sensitivity of <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumour cell lines may be a consequence of defects in the HRR pathway. The increased thymidine sensitivity and the loss of an important pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks create new opportunities for therapies directed specifically against this subset of tumours...|$|E
40|$|Current {{published}} {{data suggest}} that DNA mismatch repair (MMR) triggers prolonged G 2 cell cycle checkpoint arrest after alkylation damage from N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) by activating ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-Rad 3 -related kinase). However, analyses of isogenic MMR-proficient and <b>MMR-deficient</b> human RKO colon cancer cells revealed that although ATR/Chk 1 signaling controlled G 2 arrest in <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells, ATR/Chk 1 activation {{was not involved in}} MMR-dependent G 2 arrest. Instead, we discovered that disrupting c-Abl activity using STI 571 (Gleevec™, a c-Abl inhibitor) or stable c-Abl knockdown abolished MMR-dependent p 73 α stabilization, induction of GADD 45 α protein expression, and G 2 arrest. In addition, inhibition of c-Abl also increased the survival of MNNG-exposed MMR-proficient cells to a level comparable with <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells. Furthermore, knocking down GADD 45 α (but not p 73 α) protein levels affected MMR-dependent G 2 arrest responses. Thus, MMR-dependent G 2 arrest responses triggered by MNNG are dependent on a human MLH 1 /c-Abl/GADD 45 α signaling pathway and activity. Furthermore, our {{data suggest that}} caution should be taken with therapies targeting c-Abl kinase because increased survival of mutator phenotypes may be an unwanted consequence...|$|E
40|$|Deficiencies in the {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) pathway {{are associated with}} several types of cancers, as well as resistance to commonly used chemotherapeutics. Rhodium metalloinsertors {{have been found to}} bind DNA mismatches with high affinity and specificity in vitro, and also exhibit cell-selective cytotoxicity, targeting <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells over MMR-proficient cells. Here we examine the biological fate of rhodium metalloinsertors bearing dipyridylamine ancillary ligands. These complexes are shown to exhibit accelerated cellular uptake which permits the observation of various cellular responses, including disruption of the cell cycle and induction of necrosis, which occur preferentially in the <b>MMR-deficient</b> cell line. These cellular responses provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the selective activity of this novel class of targeted anti-cancer agents. In addition, ten distinct metalloinsertors with varying lipophilicities are synthesized and their mismatch binding affinities and biological activities studied. While they are found to have similar binding affinities, their cell-selective antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities vary significantly. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) experiments show that all of these metalloinsertors localize in the nucleus at sufficient concentrations for binding to DNA mismatches. Furthermore, metalloinsertors with high rhodium localization in the mitochondria show toxicity that is not selective for <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells. This work supports the notion that specific targeting of the metalloinsertors to nuclear DNA gives rise to their cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities that are selective for cells deficient in MMR. To explore further the basis of the unique selectivity of the metlloinsertors in targeting <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells, experiments were conducted using engineered NCI-H 23 lung adenocarcinoma cells that contain a doxycycline-inducible shRNA which suppresses the expression of the MMR gene MLH 1. Here we use this new cell line to further validate rhodium metalloinsertors as compounds capable of differentially inhibiting the proliferation of <b>MMR-deficient</b> cancer cells over isogenic MMR-proficient cells. General DNA damaging agents, such as cisplatin and etoposide, in contrast, are less effective in the induced cell line defective in MMR. Finally, we describe a new subclass of metalloinsertors with enhanced potency and selectivity, in which the complexes show Rh-O coordination. In particular, it has been found that both Δ and Λ enantiomers of [Rh(chrysi) (phen) (DPE) ] 2 + bind to DNA with similar affinities, suggesting a possible different binding conformation than previous metalloinsertors. Remarkably, all members of this new family of compounds have significantly increased potency in a range of cellular assays; indeed, all are more potent than the FDA-approved anticancer drugs cisplatin and MNNG. Moreover, these activities are coupled with high levels of selectivity for <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells. ...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify MMR gene mutation carriers in two cohorts of population-based CRC utilizing a combination of tumor and germline testing approaches. METHODS: Colorectal cancers from 813 patients diagnosed with CRC <[*] 60 [*]years of age from the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry (ACCFR) and from 826 patients from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) were tested for MMR protein expression using immunohistochemistry, microsatellite instability (MSI), BRAFV 600 E somatic mutation, and for MLH 1 methylation. MMR gene mutation testing (Sanger sequencing and Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification) was performed on germline DNA of patients with <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors and a subset of MMR-proficient CRCs. RESULTS: Of the 813 ACCFR probands, 90 probands demonstrated tumor MMR deficiency (11. 1 %), and 42 had a MMR gene germline mutation (5. 2 %). For the MCCS, MMR deficiency was identified in the tumors of 103 probands (12. 5 %) and seven had a germline mutation (0. 8 %). All the mutation carriers were diagnosed prior to 70 [*]years of age.

40|$|A {{substantial}} {{fraction of}} sporadic and inherited colorectal and endometrial cancers in humans is deficient in DNA mismatch repair (MMR). These cancers {{are characterized by}} length alterations in ubiquitous simple sequence repeats, a phenotype called microsatellite instability. Here we have exploited this phenotype by developing a novel approach for the highly selective gene therapy of <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors. To achieve this selectivity, we mutated the VP 22 FCU 1 suicide gene by inserting an out-of-frame microsatellite within its coding region. We show that in a significant fraction of microsatellite-instable (MSI) cells carrying the mutated suicide gene, full-length protein becomes expressed within a few cell doublings, presumably resulting from a reverting frameshift within the inserted microsatellite. Treatment of these cells with the innocuous prodrug 5 -fluorocytosine (5 -FC) induces strong cytotoxicity and we demonstrate that this owes to multiple bystander effects conferred by the suicide gene/prodrug combination. In a mouse model, <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors that contained the out-of-frame VP 22 FCU 1 gene displayed strong remission after treatment with 5 -FC, without any obvious adverse systemic effects to the mouse.

DNA photocleavage experiments reveal that all complexes bind to the mismatch sites with high specificities; DNA binding affinities to oligonucleotides containing single base CA and CC mismatches, obtained through photocleavage titration or competition, vary from 10 ^ 4 to 10 ^ 8 M^− 1 for the series of complexes.

40|$|In most organisms, the {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) system {{plays an important}} role in substantially lowering mutation rates and blocking recombination between nonidentical sequences. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the products of three genes homologous to Escherichia coli mutS—MSH 2, MSH 3, and MSH 6 —function in MMR by recognizing mispaired bases. To determine the effect of MMR on single-base pair mismatches, we have measured reversion rates of specific point mutations in the CYC 1 gene in both wild-type and <b>MMR-deficient</b> strains. The reversion rates of all of the point mutations are similar in wild-type cells. However, we find that in the absence of MSH 2 or MSH 6, but not MSH 3, reversion rates of some mutations are increased by up to 60, 000 -fold, whereas reversion rates of other mutations are essentially unchanged. When cells are grown anaerobically, the reversion rates in <b>MMR-deficient</b> strains are decreased by as much as a factor of 60. We suggest that the high reversion rates observed in these <b>MMR-deficient</b> strains are caused by misincorporations opposite oxidatively damaged bases and that MMR normally prevents these mutations. We further suggest that recognition of mispairs opposite damaged bases may be a more important role for MMR in yeast than correction of errors opposite normal bases...|$|E
40|$|The p 300 -mediated {{acetylation}} of enzymes {{involved in}} DNA repair and replication {{has been previously}} shown to stimulate or inhibit their activities in reconstituted systems. To explore the role of acetylation on DNA repair in cells we constructed plasmid substrates carrying inactivating damages in the EGFP reporter gene, which should be repaired in cells through DNA mismatch repair (MMR) or base excision repair (BER) mechanisms. We analyzed efficiency of repair within these plasmid substrates in cells exposed to deacetylase and acetyltransferase inhibitors, and also in cells deficient in p 300 acetyltransferase. Our results indicate that protein acetylation improves DNA mismatch repair in MMR-proficient HeLa cells and also in <b>MMR-deficient</b> HCT 116 cells. Moreover, results suggest that stimulated repair of mismatches in <b>MMR-deficient</b> HCT 116 cells is done though a strand-displacement synthesis mechanism described previously for Okazaki fragments maturation and also for the EXOI-independent pathway of MMR. Loss of p 300 reduced repair of mismatches in <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells, but did not have evident effects on BER mechanisms, including the long patch BER pathway. Hypoacetylation of the cells {{in the presence of}} acetyltransferase inhibitor, garcinol generally reduced efficiency of BER of 8 -oxoG damage, indicating that some steps in the pathway are stimulated by acetylation...|$|E
40|$|The Barton {{laboratory}} {{has established}} that octahedral rhodium complexes bearing the sterically expansive 5, 6 -chrysene diimine ligand can target thermodynamically destabilized sites, such as base pair mismatches, in DNA with high affinity and selectivity. These complexes approach DNA from the minor groove, ejecting the mismatched base pairs from the duplex in a binding mode termed metalloinsertion. In recent years, {{we have shown}} that these metalloinsertor complexes also exhibit cytotoxicity preferentially in cancer cells that are deficient in the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery. Here, we establish that a sensitive structure-activity relationship exists for rhodium metalloinsertors. We studied {{the relationship between the}} chemical structures of metalloinsertors and their effect on biological activity for ten complexes with similar DNA binding affinities, but wide variation in their lipophilicity. Drastic differences were observed in the selectivities of the complexes for <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells. Compounds with hydrophilic ligands were highly selective, exhibiting preferential cytotoxicity in <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells at low concentrations and short incubation periods, whereas complexes with lipophilic ligands displayed poor cell-selectivity. It was discovered that all of the complexes localized to the nucleus in concentrations sufficient for mismatch binding; however, highly lipophilic complexes also exhibited high mitochondrial uptake. Significantly, these results support the notion that mitochondrial DNA is not the desired target for our metalloinsertor complexes; instead, selectivity stems from targeting mismatches in genomic DNA. We have also explored the potential for metalloinsertors to be developed into more complex structures with multiple functionalities that could either enhance their overall potency or impart mismatch selectivity onto other therapeutic cargo. We have constructed a family of bifunctional metalloinsertor conjugates incorporating cis-platinum, each unique in its chemical structure, DNA binding interactions, and biological activity. The study of these complexes in <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells has established that the cell-selective biological activity of rhodium metalloinsertors proceeds through a critical cellular pathway leading to necrosis. We further explored the underlying mechanisms surrounding the biological response to mismatch recognition by metalloinsertors in the genome. Immunofluorescence assays of <b>MMR-deficient</b> and MMR-proficient cells revealed that a critical biomarker for DNA damage, phosphorylation of histone H 2 AX (γH 2 AX) rapidly accumulates in response to metalloinsertor treatment, signifying the induction of double strand breaks in the genome. Significantly, we have discovered that our metalloinsertor complexes selectively inhibit transcription in <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells, which may be a crucial checkpoint in the eventual breakdown of the cell via necrosis. Additionally, preliminary in vivo studies have revealed the capability of these compounds to traverse the complex environments of multicellular organisms and accumulate in <b>MMR-deficient</b> tumors. Our ever-increasing understanding of metalloinsertors, as well as the development of new generations of complexes both monofunctional and bifunctional, enables their continued progress into the clinic as promising new chemotherapeutic agents. </p...|$|E
40|$|Deficiencies in the {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) machinery lead to DNA defects that cause cancer. Cancers that exhibit MMR deficiency are typically resistant to cisplatin and carboplatin, {{but can be}} treated in part with oxaliplatin. Recently, we have shown that rhodium metalloinsertors, which bind DNA at mismatched sites with over 1000 fold selectivity, exhibit antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity selectively in cells that are <b>MMR-deficient.</b> A bimetallic complex, consisting of a rhodium metalloinsertor tethered to an oxaliplatin deriv., was synthesized to improve platinum efficacy in an <b>MMR-deficient</b> human colorectal carcinoma line (HCT 116 O). The addn. of the rhodium metalloinsertor significantly increases cytotoxic activity and whole-cell platinum uptake {{compared to that of}} unconjugated platinum, as well as cisplatin and oxaliplatin. DNA binding studies show that the complex interacts with DNA through both metalloinsertion at a mismatch as well as the formation of Pt-DNA crosslinks...|$|E
40|$|The {{genome-wide}} {{accumulation of}} DNA replication errors known as microsatellite instability (MSI) is the hallmark lesion of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficient cancers. Although testing for MSI {{is widely used}} to guide clinical management, the contribution of MSI at distinct genic loci to the phenotype remains largely unexplored. Here we report that a mononucleotide (T/U) 16 tract located in the 3 ' untranslated region (3 'UTR) of the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR 1) gene is a novel MSI target locus that shows perfect sensitivity and specificity in detecting mismatch-repair deficient cancers in two independent populations. We further found a striking re-localization of the EWSR 1 protein from nucleus to cytoplasm in <b>MMR-deficient</b> cancers, and that the non-protein coding MSI target locus itself has a modulatory effect on EWSR 1 gene expression through alternative 3 ' end processing of the EWSR 1 gene. Our results point to a MSI target gene-specific effect in <b>MMR-deficient</b> cancers...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) system {{plays a major}} role in mediating the cytotoxicity and clastogenicity of agents generating O 6 -methylguanine in DNA. Loss of MMR has also been associated with tumor cell resistance to the cytotoxic effects of 6 -thio-guanine and cisplatin and with hypersensitivity to N-(2 -chloroethyl) -Nâ€² -cyclohexyl-N-nitrosourea (CCNU). The aim of the present investigation was to elucidate the role played by the MMR system in the generation of chromosomal damage in cells exposed to 6 -thioguanine, cisplatin or CCNU. Methods: The MMR-proficient cell lines TK 6 and HCT 116 / 3 - 6, and their <b>MMR-deficient</b> counterparts MT 1 and HCT 116, were treated with 6 -thioguanine, cisplatin or CCNU, and analyzed for cell growth inhibition and chromosomal damage. As a control, similar experiments were performed with the methylating agent temozolomide. Results: Cytotoxicity, chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges induced by 6 -thioguanine and temozolomide were significantly reduced in the <b>MMR-deficient</b> cell lines with respect to their MMR-proficient counterparts. In contrast, although conferring some protection against cytotoxicity, the loss of MMR did not affect cytogenetic damage induced by cisplatin. CCNU produced comparable levels of cytotoxicity, chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in both MMR-proficient and <b>MMR-deficient</b> cell lines. Conclusions: The MMR system is involved in the generation of chromosomal damage in cells exposed to 6 -thioguanine. The system does not play a relevant role in the generation of chromosomal damage in cells treated with CDDP and does not confer protection against the clastogenic effects of CCNU, at least in the cell lines investigated...|$|E
40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is {{prevalent}} worldwide, {{and treatment}} often involves surgery and genotoxic chemotherapy. DNA repair mechanisms, such as base excision repair (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR), may not only influence tumour characteristics and prognosis but also dictate chemotherapy response. Defective MMR contributes to chemoresistance in colorectal cancer. Moreover, BER affects cellular survival by repairing genotoxic base damage {{in a process}} that itself can disrupt metabolism. In this study, we characterized BER and MMR gene expression in colorectal tumours and the association between this repair profile with patients’ clinical and pathological features. In addition, we exploited the possible mechanisms underlying the association between altered DNA repair, metabolism and response to chemotherapy. Seventy pairs of sporadic colorectal tumour samples and adjacent non-tumour mucosal specimens were assessed for BER and MMR gene and protein expression and their association with pathological and clinical features. <b>MMR-deficient</b> colon cancer cells (HCT 116) transiently overexpressing MPG or XRCC 1 were treated with 5 -FU or TMZ and evaluated for viability and metabolic intermediate levels. Increase in BER gene and protein expression is associated with more aggressive tumour features and poor pathological outcomes in CRC. However, tumours with reduced MMR gene expression also displayed low MPG, OGG 1 and PARP 1 expression. Imbalancing BER by overexpression of MPG, but not XRCC 1, sensitises <b>MMR-deficient</b> colon cancer cells to 5 -FU and TMZ and leads to ATP depletion and lactate accumulation. MPG overexpression alters DNA repair and metabolism and is a potential strategy to overcome 5 -FU chemotherapeutic resistance in <b>MMR-deficient</b> CRC...|$|E
40|$|Deficiencies in DNA {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) have {{been implicated in}} the development of several forms of cancers, and <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells tend to be resistant to commonly employed cancer therapeutics such as cisplatin. Mismatch-targeting metalloinsertors developed in our laboratory have shown great promise as therapeutic and diagnostic agents for <b>MMR-deficient</b> cancers. In this work, we examine fundamental aspects of binding interactions of octahedral rhodium and ruthenium complexes to DNA mismatches, and strive to develop a luminescent sensor for mismatches inside cells. We first demonstrate that the mismatch binding affinity of rhodium metalloinsertors directly correlates with their antiproliferative effect against <b>MMR-deficient</b> colorectal carcinoma cells. Smaller ancillary ligands on the rhodium center facilitate binding to mismatches via metalloinsertion from the narrow minor groove of DNA. Complexes with higher mismatch binding affinity in turn selectively inhibit the growth of <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells compared to MMR-proficient ones. This correlation suggests that DNA mismatches are indeed the biological target of rhodium metalloinsertors inside cells. Besides rhodium metalloinsertors, luminescent ruthenium complexes are found to bind DNA mismatches as well. Mismatch binding is accompanied by enhanced luminescence intensity. We determined two crystal structures of Δ-Ru(bpy) 2 dppz 2 + bound to oligonucleotide duplexes. For an oligonucleotide containing AA mismatches, the atomic-resolution structure revealed that the ruthenium complex binds to DNA mismatches also through metalloinsertion: the complex inserts a planar ligand into the mismatched site from the minor groove, ejecting the mismatched bases out of the helix. Several binding geometries of the complex intercalated between well-matched DNA were also observed. To improve the mismatch selectivity of luminescent ruthenium complexes, we tethered the complexes to organic dye molecules in an effort to amplify mismatch-associated luminescence signal through resonance energy transfer. We also modified the structure of the inserting ligand in an attempt to improve the binding affinity to mismatches over well-matched DNA. Coupling mismatch binding to luminescence response has proved most challenging in these endeavors. Finally, we venture into the realm of RNA. Unlike their nonspecific binding to DNA, ruthenium complexes bind poorly to well-matched RNA but quite avidly to RNA mismatches. As a result, mismatched RNA produces a higher luminescence signal from bound ruthenium. We subsequently applied the ruthenium complex to image RNA mismatches inside live HeLa cells using fluorescence microscopy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) are well-known cancer preventives, {{which have}} been largely attributed to their antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities. In this study, we show that microsatellite instability (MSI) in colorectal cancer cells deficient for {{a subset of the}} human mismatch repair (MMR) genes (hMLH 1, hMSH 2, and hMSH 6), is markedly reduced during exposure to aspirin or sulindac [or Clinoril, which is chemically related to indomethacin (Indocin) ]. This effect was reversible, time and concentration dependent, and appeared independent of proliferation rate and cyclooxygenase function. In contrast, the MSI phenotype of a hPMS 2 -deficient endometrial cancer cell line was unaffected by aspirin/sulindac. We show that the MSI reduction in the susceptible <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells was confined to nonapoptotic cells, whereas apoptotic cells remained unstable and were eliminated from the growing population. These results suggest that aspirin/sulindac induces a genetic selection for microsatellite stability in a subset of <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells and may provide an effective prophylactic therapy for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer kindreds where alteration of the hMSH 2 and hMLH 1 genes are associated with the majority of cancer susceptibility cases...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) {{is crucial to}} ensuring the fidelity of the genome. The inability to correct single base mismatches leads to elevated mutation rates and carcinogenesis. Using metalloinsertors–bulky metal complexes that bind with high specificity to mismatched sites in the DNA duplex–our laboratory has adopted a new chemotherapeutic strategy through the selective targeting of <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells, that is, those that have a propensity for cancerous transformation. Rhodium metalloinsertors display inhibitory effects selectively in cells that are deficient in the MMR machinery, consistent with this strategy. However, a highly sensitive structure–function relationship is emerging {{with the development of}} new complexes that highlights the importance of subcellular localization. We have found that small structural modifications, for example a hydroxyl versus a methyl functional group, can yield profound differences in biological function. Despite similar binding affinities and selectivities for DNA mismatches, only one metalloinsertor shows selective inhibition of cellular proliferation in <b>MMR-deficient</b> versus -proficient cells. Studies of whole-cell, nuclear and mitochondrial uptake reveal that this selectivity depends upon targeting DNA mismatches in the cell nucleus...|$|E
40|$|PolyA simple repeat {{sequence}} deletions {{are common}} in tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI+). Such deletions occur one base {{at a time in}} DNA mismatch repair (MMR) -deficient yeast suggesting larger deletions in human MSI+ tumors represent multiple sequential stepwise losses. Sum total deletions in four polyA repeats were variable (between − 17 to − 45 bp) in 20 sporadic MSI+ colorectal cancers. Progressive but less extensive total deletions (maximum of − 12 bp) occurred in similar polyA sequences in <b>MMR-deficient</b> mice (mlh 1 −/−) up to 478 days old. PolyA repeat lengths were relatively stable but already shortened in the <b>MMR-deficient</b> cell line HCT 116. A transgene with 26 A’s transfected into HCT 116 shortened an average of 3. 8 bases pairs after 469 days in culture, less than average deletions of BAT 25 (− 5. 3) or BAT 26 (− 9. 0) in MSI+ cancers. These findings further suggest that extensive polyA deletions common in MSI+ tumors likely reflect multiple stepwise smaller deletions that accumulate more than hundreds of divisions after loss of MMR...|$|E
40|$|Regulatory T cells (T(reg)) {{inhibit the}} {{generation}} of host-versus-tumor immunity via suppression of tumor-specific effector T-cell responses and development of immune tolerance to neoplastic cells. The transcription factor forkhead box P 3 (FOXP 3) is an intracellular key molecule for T(reg) development and function and is considered to represent the most specific T(reg) cell marker. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the frequency and prognostic impact of tumor-infiltrating FOXP 3 (+) T(reg) in colorectal cancer (CRC) stratified by mismatch-repair (MMR) status. Using the tissue microarray technique, 1, 420 tumor samples were immunohistochemically stained for FOXP 3 and stratified into 1, 197 MMR-proficient and 223 <b>MMR-deficient</b> CRCs. Additionally, the 1, 197 MMR-proficient CRCs were randomized into 2 subgroups (Test Groups 1 and 2; n = 613 and 584, respectively). In both MMR-proficient CRC subgroups high frequency tumor-infiltrating FOXP 3 (+) T(reg) was associated with early T stage (p = 0. 001 and > 0. 001), tumor location (p = 0. 01 and 0. 045) and increased 5 -year survival rate (p = 0. 004 and > 0. 001), whereas in <b>MMR-deficient</b> CRCs an association between FOXP 3 (+) T(reg) and absence of lymph node involvement (p = 0. 023), absence of vascular invasion (p = 0. 023) and improved 5 -year survival rate (p = 0. 029) could be detected. In a multivariable analysis including age, gender, T stage, N stage, tumor grade, vascular invasion, and tumor border configuration, a high FOXP 3 (+) T(reg) frequency was an independent prognostic factor in both MMR-proficient CRC subsets (p = 0. 019 and p = 0. 007), but not in the <b>MMR-deficient</b> CRCs (p = 0. 13). Therefore, high frequency of tumor-infiltrating FOXP 3 (+) T(reg) is associated with early T stage and independently predicts improved disease-specific survival in MMR-proficient CRC patients...|$|E
40|$|Lynch {{syndrome}} (LS) is a hereditary cancer predisposition {{caused by}} inactivating mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Mutations in the MSH 6 DNA MMR gene account for approximately 18 % of LS cases. Many LS-associated sequence variants are nonsense and frameshift mutations that clearly abrogate MMR activity. However, missense mutations whose functional implications are unclear are also frequently seen in suspected-LS patients. To conclusively diagnose LS and enroll patients in appropriate surveillance programs to reduce morbidity {{as well as}} mortality, the functional consequences of these variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) must be defined. We present an oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis screen for the identification of pathogenic MSH 6 VUS. In the screen, the MSH 6 variant of interest is introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells by site-directed mutagenesis. Subsequent selection for <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells using the DNA damaging agent 6 -thioguanine (6 TG) allows the identification of MMR abrogating VUS because solely <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells survive 6 TG exposure.

40|$|Common fragile sites (CFS) are {{specific}} chromosomal areas prone to form gaps and breaks when cells {{are exposed to}} stresses that affect DNA synthesis, such as exposure to aphidicolin (APC), an inhibitor of DNA polymerases. The APC-induced DNA damage is repaired primarily by homologous recombination (HR), and RAD 51, {{one of the key}} players in HR, participates to CFS stability. Since another DNA repair pathway, the mismatch repair (MMR), is known to control HR, we examined the influence of both the MMR and HR DNA repair pathways on the extent of chromosomal damage and distribution of CFS provoked by APC and/or by RAD 51 silencing in <b>MMR-deficient</b> and -proficient colon cancer cell lines (i. e., HCT- 15 and HCT- 15 transfected with hMSH 6, or HCT- 116 and HCT- 116 / 3 + 6, in which a part of a chromosome 3 containing the wild-type hMLH 1 allele was inserted). Here, we show that <b>MMR-deficient</b> cells are more sensitive to APC-induced chromosomal damage particularly at the CFS as compared to MMR-proficient cells, indicating an involvement of MMR in the control of CFS stability. The most expressed CFS is FRA 16 D in 16 q 23, an area containing the tumour suppressor gene WWOX often mutated in colon cancer. We also show that silencing of RAD 51 provokes a higher number of breaks in MMR-proficient cells with respect to their <b>MMR-deficient</b> counterparts, likely {{as a consequence of the}} combined inhibitory effects of RAD 51 silencing on HR and MMR-mediated suppression of HR. The RAD 51 silencing causes a broader distribution of breaks at CFS than that observed with APC. Treatment with APC of RAD 51 -silenced cells further increases DNA breaks in MMR-proficient cells. The RNAi-mediated silencing of PARP- 1 does not cause chromosomal breaks or affect the expression/distribution of CFS induced by APC. Our results indicate that MMR modulates colon cancer sensitivity to chromosomal breaks and CFS induced by APC and RAD 51 silencing...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDNA {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) deficiency {{is one of}} the best understood forms of genetic instability in colorectal cancer (CRC), and is characterised by the loss of function of the MMR pathway. Failure to repair replication-associated errors due to a defective MMR system allows persistence of mismatch mutations all over the genome, but especially in regions of repetitive DNA known as microsatellites, giving rise to the phenomenon of microsatellite instability (MSI). A high frequency of instability at microsatellites (MSI-H) is the hallmark of the most common form of hereditary susceptibility to CRC, known as Lynch Syndrome (previously known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) syndrome), but is also observed in ~ 15 - 20 % of sporadic colon cancers (and rarely in rectal cancers). Tumour analysis by both MMR protein immunohistochemistry and DNA testing for MSI is necessary to provide a comprehensive picture of molecular abnormality, for use in conjunction with family history data and other clinico-pathological features, in order to distinguish Lynch Syndrome from sporadic <b>MMR-deficient</b> CRC.
