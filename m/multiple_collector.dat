30|$|Electrical {{power cables}} in tidal turbine farms {{contribute}} a significant share to capital expenditure (CAPEX). As a result, the routing of electrical power cables connecting turbines to cable collector hubs must be designed {{so as to}} obtain the least cost configuration. This {{is referred to as}} a tidal cable routing problem. This problem possesses several variants depending on the number of cable collector hubs. In this paper, these variants are modeled by employing the approach of the single depot multiple traveling salesman problem (mTSP) and the multiple depot mTSP of operational research for the single and <b>multiple</b> cable <b>collector</b> variants, respectively. The developed optimization models are computationally implemented using MATLAB. In the triple cable collector cable hub variant, an optimal solution is obtained, while good-quality suboptimal solutions are obtained in the double and single cable collector hub variants. In practice, <b>multiple</b> cable <b>collector</b> hubs are expected to be employed as the multiple hub configurations tend to be more economic than the single hub configurations.

As to be expected, the three hub case results in the cheapest cable routing, in comparison with the double and single hub cases, notwithstanding that in using the MATLAB/intlinprog computing module, an optimal solution is obtained for the triple hub case, while good suboptimal solutions are obtained for the double and single hub cases.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{distribution}} and risk factors of depleted uranium uptake in military personnel who had taken part in the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Methods: Sector field inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS) {{was used to determine}} the uranium concentration and 238 U/ 235 U isotopic ratio in spot urine samples. The authors collected urine samples from four groups identified a priori as having different potential for exposure to depleted uranium. These groups were: combat personnel (n = 199); non-combat personnel (n = 96); medical personnel (n = 22); and "clean-up" personnel (n = 24) who had been involved in the maintenance, repair or clearance of potentially contaminated vehicles in Iraq. A short questionnaire was used to ascertain individual experience of circumstances in which depleted uranium exposure might have occurred. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the 238 U/ 235 U ratio between groups. Mean ratios by group varied from 138. 0 (95 % CI 137. 3 to 138. 7) for clean-up personnel to 138. 2 (95 % CI 138. 0 to 138. 5) for combat personnel, and were close to the ratio of 137. 9 for natural uranium. The two highest individual ratios (146. 9 and 147. 7) were retested using more accurate, <b>multiple</b> <b>collector</b> inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) and found to be within measurement of error of that for natural uranium. There {{were no significant differences in}} isotope ratio between participants according to self-reported circumstances of potential depleted uranium exposure. Conclusions: Based on measurements using a SF-ICP-MS apparatus, this study provides reassurance following concern for potential widespread depleted uranium uptake in the UK military. The rare occurrence of elevated ratios may reflect the limits of accuracy of the SF-ICP-MS apparatus and not a real increase from the natural proportions of the isotopes. Any uptake of depleted uranium among participants in this study sample would be very unlikely to have any implications for health.

Compared to conventional analytical techniques, it has the advantages of minimum sample preparation and high spatial resolution capabilities.

The aim of my Ph. D. is to understand the mechanisms of laser-solid interaction which can be an important step to improve the analytical capabilities of LA-ICP-MS.

50|$|Unlike atomic {{absorption}} spectroscopy, {{which can only}} measure a single element at a time, ICP-MS has the capability to scan for all elements simultaneously. This allows rapid sample processing. A simultaneous ICP-MS that can record the entire analytical spectrum from lithium to uranium in every analysis won the Silver Award at the 2010 Pittcon Editors' Awards. An ICP-MS may use multiple scan modes, each one striking a different balance between speed and precision. Using the magnet alone to scan is slow, due to hysteresis, but is precise. Electrostatic plates {{can be used in}} addition to the magnet to increase the speed, and this, combined with <b>multiple</b> <b>collectors,</b> can allow a scan of every element from Lithium 6 to Uranium Oxide 256 in {{less than a quarter of}} a second. For low detection limits, interfering species and high precision, the counting time can increase substantially. The rapid scanning, large dynamic range and large mass range is ideally suited to measuring multiple unknown concentrations and isotope ratios in samples that have had minimal preparation (an advantage over TIMS), for example seawater, urine, and digested whole rock samples. It also lends well to laser ablated rock samples, where the scanning rate is so quick that a real time plot of any number of isotopes is possible.This also allows easy spatial mapping of mineral grains.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of a commercially available double focusing magnetic sector ICP-mass spectrometer (Element, Finnigan MAT, D) for precise isotope ratio measurement at the low resolution setting (R = 300) was evaluated. Optimization of scanning conditions permitted a relative standard deviation {{for a set of}} 10 consecutive 2 min measurements of about 0. 1 % RSD at signal intensities of ca. 200, 000 cps (peak height). This compares favourably with the best values ever reported for quadrupole ICP-MS and barely exceeds the theoretical value (counting statistics). Increasing the signal intensity to values 500, 000 cps resulted in a further reduction of the RSDs obtained to values of typically 0. 04 %.
