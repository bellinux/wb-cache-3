50|$|Magnetic yoke is a {{hand-held}} device that induces {{a magnetic field}} between two poles. Common applications are for outdoor use, remote locations, and weld inspection. The draw back of <b>magnetic</b> <b>yokes</b> is that they only induce a magnetic field between the poles, so large-scale inspections using the device can be time-consuming. For proper inspection the yoke needs to be rotated 90 degrees for every inspection area to detect horizontal and vertical discontinuities. Subsurface detection using a yoke is limited. These systems used dry magnetic powders, wet powders, or aerosols.|$|E
40|$|Soft <b>magnetic</b> <b>yokes,</b> cores, and poles, {{as well as}} {{permanent}} magnets are the potential magnetic components of an electromagnetic microactuator system. Depending on {{the requirements of the}} actuator, soft magnetic materials, hard magnetic materials or a combination of both have to be applied. Their design and fabrication as well as their integration into coil systems is one aspect of the Collaborate Research Center Design and Fabrication of Active Microsystems (Sonderforschungsbereich 516). The investigations presented in this paper cover alternative technologies for depositing various magnetic materials as well as their capability of being utilized for fabricating electromagnetic Microsystems. In the area of soft magnetic materials, the application of NiFe (Permalloy) in various compositions was investigated. Technologies utilized for their deposition were electroplating, sputtering, and gas flow sputtering. For fabricating rather thick soft magnetic micro structures with heights of up to 70 m, electroplating is particularly well suited. In the area of hard magnetic materials, sputtering was applied for depositing Samarium-Cobalt (SmCo). Hereby, layers with a thickness of up to 50 m with very good hard magnetic properties were deposited and patterned using wet chemical etching.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} Barkhausen Noise {{technique is}} a well suited method for the characterization of ferromagnetic materials. Most sensors are composed of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke</b> that excites the electromagnetic field in the material, and a coil or Hall-Element, which is located between both feet of the yoke to record the Barkhausen Noise. Due to both factors, the overall size of the sensors and the spot size at the material are relatively large. For some applications, Barkhausen Noise Sensors for miniaturized samples with complex geometries are needed, for example for small mass-production components or measurements inside of boreholes. Therefore, a new design for a Barkhausen Noise sensor was developed. The principle of exciting the Magnetic Field changes from a <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke</b> to a thin tip. The alternating current flows through the tip into the material and induces a magnetic field, which in turn generates the Barkhausen Noise. A small coil wounded around the tip, records the Barkhausen Noise signal. With this design, the contact point between sensor and material is very small {{and it is possible}} to apply the sensor to very small samples or inside boreholes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:The Barkhausen {{effect is}} a {{response}} of a ferromagnetic material, that is its magnetic domains, to an imposed external alternating magnetic field. A sensor unit {{makes it possible to}} capture the so-called voltage signal of the magnetic Barkhausen noise that represents mapping of the individual characteristics of the material microstructure. The paper gives a comparison of a classical sensor unit having the magnetising and detecting sections separated and a compact sensor unit. The aim was to reduce the volume of the passive sensor unit and possibly increase the accuracy, sensibility and reliability of calibration curves. To this end two compact sensor units were developed. The first one consists of a detection coil integrated into a gap of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke.</b> A comparison was made of the results obtained with a compact sensor unit having an additional ferrite core and a detection section integrated as well in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke.</b> The sensor units were tested using the so-called calibration curves showing the dependence between an individual parameter searched for and a degree of cold deformation known in advance. The reference curves of calibration of cold deformation of the material plotted as functions of the calculated power of the voltage signal, the variance, the Vrms of the voltage signal, and other estimators will be shown {{as a starting point for}} practical applications in the industrial environment. The magnetic method based on the Barkhausen noise thus permits a direct, that is non-destructive...|$|R

The feasibility of the magnetic saturation PECT method for wall thinning detection in carbon steel piping is validated through numerical simulations. Firstly, the simulated polarization approach is adopted for the calculation of the static magnetic field distribution generated by the electromagnetic magnet, then the material permeability distribution is predicted according to the B-H curve of the targeted material.

50|$|The DPS employs two linear {{actuators}} and a central pivoting armature {{that holds the}} iris. The two parallel {{linear actuators}} have coordinated motion {{in such a way}} as to produce both x and y motions of the iris. For illustrative purposes think of the way, a tank moves. If both tank treads move forward/backward the “gun tip” moves forward/backward (both treads moving normally). If one tread moves opposite to the other (turning, both treads moving differentially) the “gun tip” would move left or right. It is this type of differential motion that allows the iris to be positioned in any area of the optical axis in the lens, and do it in the smallest possible space. The linear actuators consist of a moving coil and fixed <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke</b> assembly, very similar to the typical actuator that controls the read/write heads in a computer hard drive.

Most finite element codes approach the calculation of force using the Coulomb energy technique [1], wherein the necessary derivatives on the magnetic field energy are taken inside the variational integrals. The boundary element approach described in this paper seeks yet another alternative for calculating the force. This boundary element approach attempts to represent the field both {{in the air and}} in the iron regions with a sheet of current on the air iron interface, with additional volume currents distributed throughout the medium which is saturated.
