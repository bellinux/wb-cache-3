40|$|We have {{recently}} purified the <b>modulator</b> of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex from rat liver. Purified <b>modulator</b> inhibits glucocorticoid-receptor complex activation and stabilizes the steroid-binding {{ability of the}} unoccupied glucocorticoid receptor. Since these activities are shared by exogenous sodium molybdate, <b>modulator</b> {{appears to be the}} endogenous factor that sodium molybdate mimics. In this report, we present additional evidence for the mechanism of action of purified <b>modulator.</b> (i) Molybdate and <b>modulator</b> inhibit receptor activation as measured by DNA-cellulose binding, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and Sepharose 4 B gel filtration. (ii) The ability of molybdate and <b>modulator</b> to inhibit receptor activation and stabilize the unoccupied receptor appears to be additive. (iii) Scatchard analysis of heat-destabilized unoccupied receptors indicates that the number of steroid-binding sites is reduced during destabilization, whereas the steroid dissociation constant remains unchanged. Molybdate and <b>modulator</b> stabilize the receptor by maintaining the number of steroid-binding sites. (iv) Molybdate and <b>modulator</b> do not inhibit alkaline phosphatase-induced destabilization of the unoccupied receptor. However, alkaline phosphatase-induced destabilization is reversed by the addition of dithiothreitol in the presence, but not in the absence, of molybdate or <b>modulator.</b> These results suggest that the mechanism of action for <b>modulator</b> is identical to that of sodium molybdate, and we propose that <b>modulator</b> is the endogenous molybdate factor for the glucocorticoid receptor...|$|R

5|$|When {{used as a}} tunable {{narrow band}} filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical <b>modulators</b> as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.|$|E

5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} find wide use {{in liquid}} crystal displays, which {{rely on the}} optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in {{the presence or absence}} of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see Twisted nematic field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light <b>modulators.</b> Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.|$|E

The P 2 Marx utilizes a redundant architecture, air-insulation, a control system with abundant diagnostic access, and a novel nested droop correction scheme. This paper is an overview of the design of this <b>modulator.</b> There are several points of emphasis for the P 2 Marx design. First, the <b>modulator</b> must be compatible with the ILC two-tunnel design. In this scheme, the <b>modulator</b> and klystron are located within a service tunnel with limited access and available footprint for a <b>modulator.</b> Access to the <b>modulator</b> is only practical from one side. Second, the <b>modulator</b> must have high availability. Robust components are not sufficient alone to achieve availability much higher than 99 %. Therefore, redundant architectures are necessary. Third, the <b>modulator</b> must be relatively low cost. Because of the large number of stations in the ILC, the investment needed for the <b>modulator</b> components is significant. High-volume construction techniques which take advantage of an economy of scale must be utilized. Fourth, the <b>modulator</b> must be simple and efficient to maintain. If a <b>modulator</b> does become inoperable, the MTTR must be small. Fifth, even though the present application for the <b>modulator</b> is for the ILC, future accelerators can also take advantage of this development effort.
