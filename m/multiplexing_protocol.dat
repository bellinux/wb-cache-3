In the present study, a <b>multiplex</b> PCR <b>protocol</b> originally developed for fragment analysis was evaluated for sequencing based mutation screening of the ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) and the medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) genes. Methods: Single exon and <b>multiplex</b> PCR <b>protocols</b> were applied to generate PCR templates for subsequent DNA sequencing of all exons of the OTC and the MCAD genes. For each PCR protocol and using the same DNA samples, 66 OTC and 98 MCAD sequence reads were generated.

Medium access control (MAC) layer packet retransmission limit has been used as an actuator for transmit cooperative diversity initialization. Transmit diversity is provided by the relays in close proximity to source node. Closed form expressions are obtained for packet error rate (PER) and average delay for the proposed scheme in Nakagami-m fading channels. This cooperative scheme achieves lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values for desired packet error rate and markedly improves the average delay per packet compared to the direct transmissions at low SNR regime. Finally, the results of computer simulations are included to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme and to verify the accuracy of analytical expressions.

Advanced automated and adaptive connectivity of objects, systems, and services is expected to be achieved under the IoT context, especially in the industrial environment.

The Object Layer, where real-time and reliable information acquisition from the physical objects carried out, is the basic enabler in the 3 -layer industrial IoT system. Such acquisition system features deterministic access, reliable communication with failure resistance mechanism, latency-aware real-time response, deployable structure/protocol, and adaptive performance on various QoS demands.

A discrete gateway structure and a contention-free communication protocol are designed to fulfill the unique system requirements. Such gateway structure offers a flexible configuration of readers and RF technologies. It enables a full duplex communication between the objects and the gateway. The designed MF-TDMA protocol can enhance the failure resistance and emergency report mechanism thanks to the separation of control link and data link in the gateway.
