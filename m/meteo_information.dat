40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the Atmospheric Phase Screen issue in Ground Based SAR interferometry. The ku-band RADAR used, the “IBIS” by IDS, is capable to {{continuously}} image scenes of a few square kilometers with a repeat interval that ranges from {{a small fraction of}} a second (in unfocused mode), up to a few minutes (in focused SAR mode). Such features allowed an assessment of the time-varying statistics of the APS, leading to some interesting quantitative considerations. With the aim of estimating and removing the APS from the data, an alternative approach with respect to the currently well-known techniques has been investigated: a compensation strategy based on the available on-site <b>meteo</b> <b>information</b> has indeed been developed. The results of the technique are critically discussed {{in the case of a}} real campaign dataset...|$|E
40|$|The function, working principle, the {{principles}} of usage andthe advantages of modern Automatic Dependent Surveillancesystem (ADS). The functions of the mentioned system aremanifold and its primary function is to enable the automaticexchange of various data between air traffic control units withthe aim of maintaining the safe separation of aircraft. Datasuch as call sign, aircraft position, time, altitude, vector information,speed, <b>meteo</b> <b>information</b> etc. can be fonvarded periodicallyor on request, and are received automatically in theaircraft via flight management computer (FMC). Also, theoverview of the possible communication systems which enablethe usage of ADS is given, with special emphasis on ADS aspart of further global development of navigation and air trafficsafety system, which {{was approved by the}} International CivilAviation Organisation (JCAO). Finally, a new, improved versionof Automatic Dependent Swveillance, ADS- B (Broadcast) is briefly outlined, a version which enables omni-directionalemission of addressed infonnation...|$|E
40|$|Meteo Rwanda, in {{collaboration}} with the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI), has implemented {{the first phase of the}} ENACTS (Enhancing National Climate Services) initiative. The ENACTS initiative brings climate knowledge into national decisionmaking by improving availability, access and use of climate <b>information.</b> <b>Meteo</b> Rwanda staff has received a number of trainings on the different aspects of generating the datasets and developing climate information products. However, due to the recent reorganization at Meteo Rwanda, as well as updates to the tools used to generate historical data and information products, it was necessary to revise the training and update climate data and information products. The current activities, which are part of CCAFS-USAID Climate Services for Agriculture project, had two major components: (1) data quality control and generating updated climate datasets; and (2) integrating the newly generated datasets into Meteo Rwanda’s maprooms. Sixteen Meteo Rwanda staff members received six days of training on data quality control and generating updated climate datasets, and/or 4. 5 days of training on developing and maintaining ENACTS maprooms...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} five years, the Rwanda Meteorological Agency (Météo Rwanda) and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) have been working {{together}} to implement the IRI’s Enhancing National Climate Services initiative (ENACTS) in Rwanda. The ENACTS initiative brings climate knowledge into national decision- making by improving availability, access and use of climate <b>information.</b> <b>Météo</b> Rwanda staff have received a number of trainings on the different aspects of generating the datasets and developing climate information products. However, the tools used to generate ENACTS datasets have been evolving through addition of several new features. As a result, {{it is necessary to}} revise the training and to expose the staff to the new version of the tools. On the other hand, Météo Rwanda has started operating a network of automatic weather stations (AWS) and a weather radar. The integration of these datasets to ENACTS datasets is very important {{to improve the quality of}} climate data in Rwanda. Thus, the current training activities had three major components: (1) make a full use of the IRI Climate Data Tools (CDT) to create and analyze ENACTS datasets; (2) develop quality control procedures and create scripts to integrate data from the AWS network into ENACTS datasets; and (3) create scripts to process and adjust the radar-based precipitation estimates with data from the AWS network and integrate the processed data into ENACTS datasets...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays in {{a control}} tower there exist many {{different}} and independent interfaces {{in order to}} manage the airport's air and ground traffic, the systems do not share the managing information, so in the control tower position there are many screens with different information. For this reason, is necessary to study {{the integration of the}} airport systems in a unique working position, the Integrated Tower Working Position (ITWP). The Eurocontrol objective has been to design a prototype of Human-Machine Interface (HMI) which demonstrate the ITWP, so {{it will be possible to}} manage the airport movements from an integrated interface in the control tower. The information and input data integrated came from the TMA/APP sectors, AMAN(Arrival Manager), DMAN (Departure manager), A-SMGCS(Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control System), EFS, <b>METEO</b> Systems, Wake <b>information,</b> Stand and Gate Management, data link applications and ATFM applications, Airport CDM concepts. This way the tower controllers have access to all essential data and can give clearances and orders from and integrated interface, and is expected that the safety and efficiency of the air traffic management will improve. The objectives of this project are to evaluate this prototype, analyse if it is possible to manage an airport from this integrated interface and write a user manual to be able to control an airport with this prototype. Also it will be explained how to design an airport with the eDEP platform, the java files which have to be created to define all the elements (gates, taxiways, taxipoints), modify the airport arrivals and departures, taxiing routes and approximations...|$|R
