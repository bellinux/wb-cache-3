A study on young adults published in April 2008 by a team from the Universities of Michigan and Bern supports the possibility of the transfer of fluid intelligence from specifically designed working memory training.

Among other questions, {{it remains to be seen}} whether the results extend to other kinds of fluid intelligence tests than the <b>matrix</b> <b>test</b> used in the study, and if so, whether, after training, fluid intelligence measures retain their correlation with educational and occupational achievement or if the value of fluid intelligence for predicting performance on other tasks changes.

40|$|Working memory {{capacity}} (WMC) and reasoning abilities—as assessed by figural matrices tests—are substantially correlated. It is controversially discussed whether this correlation is only caused by controlled attention or also by storage capacity. This study aims at investigating storage of partial solutions {{as a possible}} mechanism by which storage capacity may contribute to solving figural <b>matrices</b> <b>tests.</b> For this purpose, we analyzed how an experimental manipulation of storage demands changes the pattern of correlations between WMC and performance in a matrix task. We manipulated the storage demands by applying two test formats: one providing the externalization of partial solutions and one {{without the possibility of}} externalization. Storage capacity was assessed by different types of change detection tasks. We found substantial correlations between storage capacity and <b>matrices</b> <b>test</b> performance, but they were of comparable size for both test formats. We take this as evidence that the necessity to store partial solutions is not the limiting factor which causes the association between storage capacity and <b>matrices</b> <b>test.</b> It is discussed how this approach can be used to investigate alternative mechanisms by that storage may influence performance in <b>matrices</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

50|$|It was {{concluded}} that the tasks performed well by H.J.A included the tasks involving ranges of imagery-based tasks, accurately make judgments about global representations such as the angles of a clock, maintained visual patters over inter-stimulus intervals, mentally rotating letters, manipulating two elements of an image. In contrast, impairment was gauged to be the lack of the ability in recalling spatial layouts, judging spatial directions, judging relative positions of objects, The Brooks <b>Matrix</b> <b>Test,</b> Compass Direction Task, reproducing abstract patterns, and reproducing both possible and impossible figures. Due to the impairment, it was identified that the patient did not have intact imagery and visual short-term memory, made apparent by the spatial relations test. Due to Integrative Agnosia, the patients take information from a top-down manner, using stored knowledge to retrieve an objects perceptual properties. It {{is much more difficult}} for patients to use a bottom-up method, or perceiving through a visual stimulus, because of the inability to accurately code the patterns in the visual short-term memory.|$|E

We use the bivariate probit model and Heckman selection model as examples.;Approximating the finite-sample distribution of this test statistic by its asymptotic distribution can lead to very misleading results: its size is severely distorted even in samples that common practice would judge to be perfectly adequate for asymptotics. This is especially true when the correlation coefficient is far from zero.;Power properties of the test statistic are investigated by using bivariate t(6) and x 2 (1) alternatives. The test has very low power against leptokurtosis, especially in the bivariate probit case, while power against asymmetry appears {{to be much more}} satisfactory.;In general, the performance of the Information <b>Matrix</b> <b>test</b> seems {{to be related to the}} amount of information on the latent variables which survives the censoring mechanism.

40|$|Current {{hypotheses}} {{suggest that}} the extracellular matrix modulates cellular function in physiologic homeostasis and during injury and repair and that selected cellular functions are cell and nuclear size dependent. For elucidation {{of the role of}} extracellular matrix-driven cell size changes in the modulation of endothelial cell proliferation and sheet migration an in vitro model system was used that allows for the culture of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) on various purified extracellular matrix components. BAEC exhibited distinct patterns in rates of attachment, spreading, migration, and proliferation when cultured on the selected extracellular matrix components laminin, types I and III collagen, type IV collagen, and fibronectin. In addition, there was a correlation between cell and nuclear size (on the various <b>matrices</b> <b>tested)</b> and rates of cell attachment and spreading.

40|$|We {{develop a}} new form of the {{information}} <b>matrix</b> <b>test</b> {{for a wide variety of}} statistical models, and present full details for the special case of univariate nonlinear regression models. Chesher (1984) showed that the implicit alternative of the information <b>matrix</b> <b>test</b> is a model with random parameter variation. We exploit this fact by constructing the test against an explicit alternative of this type. The new test is computed using a double-length artificial regression, instead of the more conventional outer product of the gradient regression, which although easy to use, is known to give test statistics with distributions very far from the asymptotic nominal distribution even in rather large samples. The new form on the other hand performs remarkably well, at least in the context of regressions models. Some approximate finite-sample distribution are calculated and lend support to the use of the new form of the test. ...|$|E
