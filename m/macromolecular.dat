5|$|Doxorubicin {{interacts with}} DNA by {{intercalation}} and inhibition of <b>macromolecular</b> biosynthesis. This inhibits {{the progression of}} topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. It may also increase quinone type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity.|$|E
5|$|In many bacteria, an S-layer of rigidly arrayed protein {{molecules}} {{covers the}} outside of the cell. This layer provides chemical and physical protection for the cell surface and can act as a <b>macromolecular</b> diffusion barrier. S-layers have diverse but mostly poorly understood functions, but are known to act as virulence factors in Campylobacter and contain surface enzymes in Bacillus stearothermophilus.|$|E
5|$|Michaelis–Menten {{kinetics}} {{relies on}} the law of mass action, which is derived from the assumptions of free diffusion and thermodynamically driven random collision. Many biochemical or cellular processes deviate significantly from these conditions, because of <b>macromolecular</b> crowding and constrained molecular movement. More recent, complex extensions of the model attempt to correct for these effects.|$|E
5|$|The first protein {{structures}} {{to be solved}} were hemoglobin and myoglobin, by Max Perutz and Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, respectively, in 1958. , the Protein Data Bank has over 126,060 atomic-resolution structures of proteins. In more recent times, cryo-electron microscopy of large <b>macromolecular</b> assemblies and computational protein structure prediction of small protein domains are two methods approaching atomic resolution.|$|E
5|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation frequently has specific requirements for X-ray crystallography. The intense ionizing radiation can cause radiation damage to samples, particularly <b>macromolecular</b> crystals. Cryo crystallography protects the sample from radiation damage, by freezing the crystal at liquid nitrogen temperatures (~100 K). However, {{synchrotron radiation}} frequently {{has the advantage}} of user selectable wavelengths, allowing for anomalous scattering experiments which maximizes anomalous signal. This is critical in experiments such as SAD and MAD.|$|E
5|$|Although {{crystallography}} {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} the disorder in an impure or irregular crystal, crystallography generally requires a pure crystal of high regularity to solve the structure of a complicated arrangement of atoms. Pure, regular crystals can sometimes be obtained from natural or synthetic materials, such as samples of metals, minerals or other macroscopic materials. The regularity of such crystals can sometimes be improved with <b>macromolecular</b> crystal annealing and other methods. However, in many cases, obtaining a diffraction-quality crystal is the chief barrier to solving its atomic-resolution structure.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{exposed to}} {{ionizing}} radiation, ultraviolet light or chemicals {{are prone to}} acquire multiple sites of bulky DNA lesions and double-strand breaks. Moreover, DNA damaging agents can damage other biomolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and RNA. The accumulation of damage, to be specific, double-strand breaks or adducts stalling the replication forks, are among known stimulation signals for a global response to DNA damage. The global response to damage is an act directed toward the cells' own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of <b>macromolecular</b> repair, lesion bypass, tolerance, or apoptosis. The common features of global response are induction of multiple genes, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cell division.|$|E
5|$|Small-molecule and <b>macromolecular</b> {{crystallography}} {{differ in}} the range of possible techniques used to produce diffraction-quality crystals. Small molecules generally have few degrees of conformational freedom, and may be crystallized by a wide range of methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and recrystallization. By contrast, macromolecules generally have many degrees of freedom and their crystallization must be carried out so as to maintain a stable structure. For example, proteins and larger RNA molecules cannot be crystallized if their tertiary structure has been unfolded; therefore, the range of crystallization conditions is restricted to solution conditions in which such molecules remain folded.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol is {{a complex}} mixture of {{substances}} dissolved in water. Although water forms {{the large majority of}} the cytosol, its structure and properties within cells is not well understood. The concentrations of ions such as sodium and potassium are different in the cytosol than in the extracellular fluid; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as osmoregulation, cell signaling, and the generation of action potentials in excitable cells such as endocrine, nerve and muscle cells. The cytosol also contains large amounts of macromolecules, which can alter how molecules behave, through <b>macromolecular</b> crowding.|$|E
5|$|This high {{concentration}} of macromolecules in cytosol causes an effect called <b>macromolecular</b> crowding, which is when the effective concentration of other macromolecules is increased, since they have less volume to move in. This crowding effect can produce large changes in both the rates and the position of chemical equilibrium of reactions in the cytosol. It is particularly important {{in its ability to}} alter dissociation constants by favoring the association of macromolecules, such as when multiple proteins come together to form protein complexes, or when DNA-binding proteins bind to their targets in the genome.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Division of Biology at Caltech, the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (and its precursors) at Cambridge, {{and a handful of}} other institutions, the Pasteur Institute became a major center for molecular biology research in the late 1950s. Scientists at Cambridge, led by Max Perutz and John Kendrew, focused on the rapidly developing field of structural biology, combining X-ray crystallography with Molecular modelling and the new computational possibilities of digital computing (benefiting both directly and indirectly from the military funding of science). A number of biochemists led by Frederick Sanger later joined the Cambridge lab, bringing together the study of <b>macromolecular</b> structure and function. At the Pasteur Institute, François Jacob and Jacques Monod followed the 1959 PaJaMo experiment with a series of publications regarding the lac operon that established the concept of gene regulation and identified what came to be known as messenger RNA. By the mid-1960s, the intellectual core of molecular biology—a model for the molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction— was largely complete.|$|E

25|$|Metabolic {{adaptation}} in tumours {{balances the}} cells' need for energy with equally important need for <b>macromolecular</b> building blocks and tighter control of redox balance. As a result, production of NADPH is greatly enhanced, which {{functions as a}} cofactor to provide reducing power in many enzymatic reactions for <b>macromolecular</b> biosynthesis {{and at the same}} time rescuing the cells from excessive ROS produced during rapid proliferation. Cells counterbalance the detrimental effects of ROS by producing antioxidant molecules, such as reduced glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (TRX), which rely on the reducing power of NADPH to maintain their activities.|$|E

25|$|Simple and concise definition: Chromatin is a <b>macromolecular</b> {{complex of}} a DNA {{macromolecule}} and protein macromolecules (and RNA). The proteins package and arrange the DNA and control its functions within the cell nucleus.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{structures}} for covalent substances, including individual molecules, molecular structures, <b>macromolecular</b> structures and giant covalent structures. Individual molecules have strong bonds that hold the atoms together, but there are negligible forces of attraction between molecules. Such covalent substances are usually gases, for example, HCl, SO2, CO2, and CH4. In molecular structures, there are weak forces of attraction. Such covalent substances are low-boiling-temperature liquids (such as ethanol), and low-melting-temperature solids (such as iodine and solid CO2). <b>Macromolecular</b> structures have large numbers of atoms linked by covalent bonds in chains, including synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and nylon, and biopolymers such as proteins and starch. Network covalent structures (or giant covalent structures) contain large numbers of atoms linked in sheets (such as graphite), or 3-dimensional structures (such as diamond and quartz). These substances have high melting and boiling points, are frequently brittle, and tend to have high electrical resistivity. Elements that have high electronegativity, {{and the ability to}} form three or four electron pair bonds, often form such large <b>macromolecular</b> structures.|$|E
25|$|Honokiol {{has also}} been {{proposed}} as an antioxidant. The compound protects against lipid peroxidation by interfering with ROS production and migration. Accumulation of ROS extracellularly causes <b>macromolecular</b> damage while intracellular accumulation may induce cytokine activation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Macromolecular</b> docking is the {{computational}} modelling of the {{quaternary structure}} of complexes formed {{by two or}} more interacting biological macromolecules. Protein–protein complexes are the most commonly attempted targets of such modelling, followed by protein–nucleic acid complexes.|$|E
25|$|An {{extension}} to StochSim {{has been presented}} by Colvin et al. Their particle-based simulator DYNSTOC uses a StochSim-like algorithm to simulate models specified in the BioNetGen language (BNGL), which improves the handling of molecules within <b>macromolecular</b> complexes.|$|E
25|$|Applications of OLEDs {{in solid}} state {{lighting}} require {{the achievement of}} high brightness with good CIE coordinates (for white emission). The use of <b>macromolecular</b> species like polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) {{in conjunction with the}} use of phosphorescent species such as Ir for printed OLEDs have exhibited brightnesses as high as 10,000cd/m2.|$|E
25|$|In non-resting cells, {{the cell}} cycle {{consists}} of G0 -> G1 -> S -> G2 -> M phases, and is tightly regulated at checkpoints between the phases. If the cell has undergone stress, certain proteins are expressed that will prevent the specific sequence of <b>macromolecular</b> interactions at the checkpoint required for progression {{to the next}} phase.|$|E
25|$|Cryogenic {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (Cryo-TEM) uses a TEM with a specimen holder capable of maintaining the specimen at liquid nitrogen or liquid helium temperatures. This allows imaging specimens prepared in vitreous ice, the preferred preparation technique for imaging individual molecules or <b>macromolecular</b> assemblies, imaging of vitrified solid-electrolye interfaces, and imaging of materials that are volatile in high vacuum at room temperature, such as sulfur.|$|E
25|$|In high-ester pectins at soluble {{solids content}} above 60% and a pH-value between 2.8 and 3.6, {{hydrogen}} bonds and hydrophobic interactions bind the individual pectin chains together. These bonds form as water is bound by sugar and forces pectin strands to stick together. These form a 3-dimensional molecular net {{that creates the}} <b>macromolecular</b> gel. The gelling-mechanism is called a low-water-activity gel or sugar-acid-pectin gel.|$|E
25|$|A {{synthetic}} polymer may be loosely {{described as}} crystalline if it contains regions of three-dimensional ordering on atomic (rather than <b>macromolecular)</b> length scales, usually arising from intramolecular folding and/or stacking of adjacent chains. Synthetic polymers may consist of both crystalline and amorphous regions; {{the degree of}} crystallinity may be {{expressed in terms of}} a weight fraction or volume fraction of crystalline material. Few synthetic polymers are entirely crystalline.|$|E
25|$|The “institute quarter” (Institutsviertel) {{is home to}} {{the science}} faculties. This campus was {{destroyed}} almost completely in the Freiburg bombing raid in 1944. After World War II, the reconstruction of the institutes began. Today, the quarter houses the physics buildings, the tall main chemistry building, visible from afar, the famous Institute for <b>Macromolecular</b> Chemistry at the Hermann-Staudinger-Haus, various other science buildings, and the renowned preclinical institutes of the Faculty of Medicine.|$|E
25|$|RAFT {{polymerization}} {{is known}} for its compatibility {{with a wide range of}} monomers as compared to other controlled radical polymerizations. Some monomers capable of polymerizing by RAFT include styrenes, acrylates, acrylamides, and many vinyl monomers. Additionally, the RAFT process allows the synthesis of polymers with specific <b>macromolecular</b> architectures such as block, gradient, statistical, comb, brush, star, hyperbranched, and network copolymers. These properties make RAFT useful in many types of polymer synthesis.|$|E

25|$|A binding {{affinity}} benchmark {{has been}} based on the protein–protein docking benchmark. 81 protein–protein complexes with known experimental affinities are included; these complexes span over 11 orders of magnitude in terms of affinity. Each entry of the benchmark includes several biochemical parameters associated with the experimental data, along with the method used to determine the affinity. This benchmark was used to assess the extent to which scoring functions could also predict affinities of <b>macromolecular</b> complexes.|$|E
25|$|The {{mission has}} yielded a {{significant}} science return, collecting {{a wealth of}} data from the nucleus and its environment at various levels of cometary activity. The VIRTIS spectrometer on board the Rosetta spacecraft has provided evidence of nonvolatile organic <b>macromolecular</b> compounds everywhere {{on the surface of}} comet 67P with little to no water ice visible. Preliminary analyses strongly suggest the carbon is present as polyaromatic organic solids mixed with sulfides and iron-nickel alloys.|$|E
25|$|The NASA {{strategy}} on abiogenesis {{states that it}} is necessary to identify interactions, intermediary structures and functions, energy sources, and environmental factors that contributed to the diversity, selection, and replication of evolvable <b>macromolecular</b> systems. Emphasis must continue to map the chemical landscape of potential primordial informational polymers. The advent of polymers that could replicate, store genetic information, and exhibit properties subject to selection likely was a critical step in the emergence of prebiotic chemical evolution.|$|E

Licenses for this software are available, for a fee, to people and groups working in academia.|$|E
25|$|Research into polymer {{electroluminescence}} {{culminated in}} 1990 with J. H. Burroughes et al. at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, UK, reporting a high efficiency green light-emitting polymer based device using 100nm thick films of poly(p-phenylene vinylene). Moving from molecular to <b>macromolecular</b> materials solved the problems previously encountered with the long-term {{stability of the}} organic films and enabled high-quality films to be easily made. Subsequent research developed multilayer polymers and the new field of plastic electronics and OLED research and device production grew rapidly.|$|E
