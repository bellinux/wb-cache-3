5|$|Mole crickets vary {{in their}} diets; some like the tawny <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> are herbivores, others are omnivores, feeding on larvae, worms, roots, and grasses, and others like the {{southern}} <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> are mainly predacious. As well as consuming roots underground, mole crickets leave their burrows at night to forage for leaves and stems which they drag underground before consumption.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mole</b> <b>cricket</b> fossils are rare. A stem group fossil, Cratotetraspinus, {{is known}} from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil. Two {{specimens}} of Marchandia magnifica in amber {{have been found in}} the Lower Cretaceous of Charente-Maritime in France. They are somewhat more abundant in the Tertiary amber of the Baltic and Dominican regions; impressions are found in Europe and the American Green River Formation.|$|E
5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do {{for about an hour}} after sunset. This may be in order to mate, or they may be influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
50|$|These are {{medium-sized}} {{or large}} <b>mole</b> <b>crickets</b> {{characterized by the}} structures on their forelegs: two sharp claws and a blade-like process with a sharp flange or tooth. Other <b>mole</b> <b>crickets</b> {{have three or four}} claws. Like other <b>mole</b> <b>crickets,</b> these burrow in the ground and the males produce calls with their tegmina.|$|R

5|$|Syrian SAMs {{had been}} a {{constant}} threat to IAF operations, and as the war progressed the Syrian SAM array in the Bekaa Valley was bolstered with additional batteries. It was therefore decided to launch a comprehensive assault on the Syrian defences, {{in order to secure}} aerial superiority over the area and ensure air support for Israeli ground forces. At 14:00 on June 9 the IAF launched Operation <b>Mole</b> <b>Cricket</b> 19, the culmination of 10 years of planning and preparation. 69 Squadron participated with 13 Tadmit and four follow-up free-fall bombers sent against the Syrians. The former operated individually, targeting Syrian fire control centers and radars, in all engaging seven SAM batteries. <b>Mole</b> <b>Cricket</b> 19 was a resounding success, with 14 out of 19 SAM batteries in the Bekaa destroyed and dozens of Syrian fighters downed in the ensueing dogfights. After the peak of June 9, during which 29 sorties were flown, activity declined. 12 more sorties were flown on June 10 and 19 on June 11, when a ceasefire came into effect. The squadron had flown 152 sorties throughout the offensive, of which 71 were close air support, 35 SEAD and 31 reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} to {{the first generation of}} fixed installation surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) such as SA-2 and SA-3 was the development of the anti-radiation missile such as AGM-45 Shrike and other means to attack fixed SAM installations, as well as developing SEAD doctrines. The Soviet counter-response was the use of mobile SAMs such as SA-6 with intermittent use of radar. Thus, the SAM battery was only visible for a small period of time, during which it was also a significant threat to high-value Wild Weasel fighters. In 1982 Operation <b>Mole</b> <b>Cricket</b> 19 various means including UAVs and air-launched Samson decoys were used over suspected SAM areas to saturate enemy SAMs and to bait them to activate their radar systems, which were then attacked by anti-radiation missiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded introductions were to Barbados and Martinique. The Barbados introductions {{were focused}} on the biological control of pests damaging the sugarcane crops, and while the toads became abundant, they have done even less to control the pests than in Australia. The toad was introduced to Martinique from French Guiana before 1944 and became established. Today, they reduce the mosquito and <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> populations. A third introduction to the region occurred in 1884, when toads appeared in Jamaica, reportedly imported from Barbados to help control the rodent population. While they had no {{significant effect on the}} rats, they nevertheless became well established. Other introductions include the release on Antiguapossibly before 1916, although this initial population may have died out by 1934 and been reintroduced at a later date and Montserrat, which had an introduction before 1879 that led to the establishment of a solid population, which was apparently sufficient to survive the Soufrière Hills volcano eruption in 1995.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 1982 Lebanon War, Syria, {{with the}} help of the Soviet Union, had built up an {{overlapping}} network of surface-to-air missiles in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. On June 9, 1982, the Israeli Air Force carried out Operation <b>Mole</b> <b>Cricket</b> 19, crippling the Syrian air defence array. In subsequent aerial battles against the Syrian Air Force, the IAF managed to shoot down 86 Syrian aircraft without losing a single fighter plane in an air-to-air combat. IAF AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships destroyed dozens of Syrian armored fighting vehicles and other ground targets, including some T-72 main battle tanks.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to {{establish}} air superiority and greater freedom of action, the Israeli Air Force launched Operation <b>Mole</b> <b>Cricket</b> 19 on June 9. During {{the course of the}} operation, the Israeli Air Force scored a dramatic victory over the Syrians, shooting down 29 Syrian planes and also destroying 17 Syrian anti-aircraft missile batteries, employing electronic warfare methods to confuse and jam the Syrian radars. The Israelis' only known losses were a single UAV shot down and two fighter jets damaged. Later that night, an Israeli air attack destroyed a Syrian armored brigade moving south from Baalbek, and the IAF attacked and destroyed six more Syrian SAM batteries the following day. The easternmost Israeli force, which had been stationary, resumed its advance forward up the Bekaa Valley.|$|E

25|$|Since {{that war}} most of Israel's {{military}} aircraft {{have been obtained}} from the United States. Among these are the F-4 Phantom II, A-4 Skyhawk, F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Israeli Air Force has also operated a number of domestically produced types such as the IAI Nesher, and later, the more advanced IAI Kfir. On June 7, 1981, eight IAF F-16A fighters covered by six F-15A jets carried out Operation Opera to destroy the Iraqi nuclear facilities at Osiraq. On June 9, 1982, the Israeli Air Force carried out Operation <b>Mole</b> <b>Cricket</b> 19, crippling the Syrian air defence array. The IAF continued to mount attacks on Hezbollah and PLO positions in south Lebanon. On October 1, 1985, In response to a PLO terrorist attack which murdered three Israeli civilians in Cyprus, the Israeli air force carried out Operation Wooden Leg. The strike involved the bombing of PLO Headquarters in Tunis, by F-15 Eagles. In 1991, the IAF carried out Operation Solomon which brought Ethiopian Jews to Israel. In 1993 and 1996, the IAF participated in Operation Accountability and Operation Grapes of Wrath, respectively. It took part in many missions since, including during the 2006 Lebanon War, Operation Cast Lead, Operation Pillar of Cloud and Operation Protective Edge. On September 6, 2007, the Israeli Air Force successfully bombed an alleged Syrian nuclear reactor in Operation Orchard.|$|E
500|$|Besides birds, toads and insectivorous mammals, {{the predators}} of mole crickets include {{subterranean}} assassin bugs, wolf spiders, and various beetles. [...] The South American nematode Steinernema scapterisci kills Neocapteriscus mole crickets by introducing bacteria into their bodies, causing an overwhelming infection. Steinernema neocurtillae {{is native to}} Florida and attacks native Neocurtilla hexadactyla mole crickets. Parasitoid wasps of the genus Larra (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) attack mole crickets, the female laying an egg on the external surface of the <b>mole</b> <b>cricket,</b> and the larva developing externally on the <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> host. Ormia depleta (Diptera: Tachinidae) is a specialized parasitoid of mole crickets in the genus Neoscapteriscus; the fly's larvae hatch from eggs inside her abdomen; she is attracted by {{the call of the}} male <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> and deposits a larva or more on any <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> individual with which she comes in contact. [...] Specialist predators of <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> eggs in China and Japan include the bombardier beetle Stenaptinus jessoensis whereas in South America they include the bombardier beetle Pheropsophus aequinoctialis (Coleoptera: Carabidae); the adult beetle lays eggs near the burrows of mole crickets, and the beetle larvae find their way to the egg chamber and eat the eggs. Fungal diseases can devastate <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> populations during winters with sudden rises of temperature and thaws. The fungus Beauveria bassiana can overwhelm adult mole crickets and several other fungal, microsporidian and viral pathogens have been identified.|$|E

500|$|Once it was {{discovered}} that gravid female Ormia depleta flies are attracted to the song of Neoscapteriscus males in South America, a path to trap these flies at synthetic <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> song was opened. Experimentation then led to a rearing method. Laborious rearing [...] of over 10,000 flies on <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> hosts allowed releases of living fly pupae at many sites in Florida from the far northwest to the far south, mainly on golf courses, and mainly in 1989-1991. Populations [...] were established, began to spread, and were monitored by use of synthetic <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> song. Eventually it {{was discovered}} that the flies had a continuous population from about 29 degrees North all the way south to Miami, but that the flies failed to survive the winter north of about 29 degrees. Shipment and release of the flies to states north of Florida was thus a wasted effort. As the flies had been imported from 23 degrees South in Brazil and could not overwinter north of 29 degrees North in Florida, it was investigated in 1999 whether flies from 30 degrees South in Brazil might survive better in northern Florida, but they did not.|$|E
500|$|The Gryllotalpidae are a {{monophyletic}} {{group in}} the order Orthoptera (grasshoppers, locusts and crickets).

500|$|The next {{detection}} was in Georgia, USA, and at {{that time}} was assumed to be N. didactylus from the West Indies. It was in fact three South American Neoscapteriscus species, N. abbreviatus, N [...] vicinus, and N. borellii, probably arrived in ship ballast. They caused major problems for decades as they spread in the southeastern USA.Scapteriscus <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> populations had built up since {{the early decades of the}} 20th century and damaged pastures, lawns, playing fields and vegetable crops. From the late 1940s chordane had been the insecticide of choice to control them, but when chordane was banned by the U.S. EPA in the 1970s, ranchers were left with no economic and effective control method. Especially to aid Florida ranchers, a project that became known as the UF/IFAS <b>Mole</b> <b>Cricket</b> Research Program was initiated in 1978. In 1985, a multi-authored report was published on accomplishments. In 1988, an account was published on prospects for biological control, and in 1996 an account of promising results with biological control. The program ended in 2004 after 25 years of running monitoring stations, and in 2006 a summary publication announced success: a 95% reduction in <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> numbers in northern Florida, with biological control agents spreading potentially to all parts of Florida. Efforts to use Larra bicolor as a biological control agent in Florida began by importing a stock from Puerto Rico. It became established in a small area of southeastern Florida but had little effect on Neoscapteriscus populations. A stock from Bolivia became established in northern Florida and spread widely (with some help) to most of the rest of the state and neighboring states. Its survival depends upon the availability of suitable nectar sources.|$|E

500|$|The male European nightjar's song is a {{sustained}} churring trill, given continuously {{for up to}} 10minutes with occasional shifts of speed or pitch. It is delivered from a perch, and the male may move around its territory using different song posts. Singing is more frequent at dawn and dusk than during the night, and is reduced in poor weather. The song may end with a bubbling trill and wing-clapping, perhaps indicating the approach of a female. Migrating or wintering birds sometimes sing. Individual male nightjars can be identified by analysing the rate and length of the pulses in their songs. Even a singing male {{may be hard to}} locate; the perched bird is difficult to spot in low light conditions, and the song has a ventriloquial quality as the singer turns his head. The song is easily audible at , and can be heard at [...] in good conditions; it can be confused with the very similar sound of the European <b>mole</b> <b>cricket.</b>|$|E
500|$|Invasive {{species are}} those that cause harm in their newly {{occupied}} area, where biological control may be attempted. The first-detected invasive <b>mole</b> <b>cricket</b> species was Neoscapteriscus didactylus, a [...] South American species reported as a pest in St. Vincent, West Indies as early as 1837; by 1900, {{it was a major}} pest of agriculture in Puerto Rico. It had probably slowly expanded its range northwards, island by island, from South America. The only biological control program against N. didactylus was in Puerto Rico, and it succeeded in establishing the parasitoid wasp Larra bicolor from Amazonian Brazil. In 2001, N. didactylus in Puerto Rico seemed to be a pest only in irrigated crops and turf. Small scale experimental applications of the nematode Steinernema scapterisci were made in irrigated turf, but survival of the nematode was poor. Very much later, this same species was reported as a pest in Queensland, Australia, presumably arriving by ship or plane. The next-detected invasive species was in the late 19th century in Hawaii, probably by ship. It was named as Gryllotalpa africana, but was probably G. orientalis. It attacked sugarcane and was targeted with Larra polita from the Philippines in 1925, apparently successfully.|$|E
