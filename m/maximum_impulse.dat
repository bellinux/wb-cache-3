40|$|Graduation date: 2010 This {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of two manuscripts based on a laboratory experiment conducted to examine realistic wave forcing on a vertical wall subjected to tsunami loading. The first manuscript examined tsunami force and pressure distributions on a rigid wall that was fronted by a small seawall. Six different seawall heights were examined, two of which were exposed {{to a range of}} solitary wave heights. The same experiment was done without a seawall for comparison. The measured wave profile contained incident offshore, incident broken, reflected broken, and transmitted wave heights measured using wire resistance and ultrasonic wave gauges. Results showed that small individual seawalls increased reflection of the incoming broken bore front and reduced force on the rigid landward wall. These findings agreed well with published field reconnaissance on small seawalls in Thailand that showed a correlation between seawalls and reduced damage on landward structures. The second manuscript examined cross-shore variation of tsunami loading as the loading scenario changed from an impulse to a quasi-steady bore. In this study tsunami force and pressure distributions on a rigid wall were determined experimentally in a large scale wave flume, and forces were examined experimentally at three different cross-shore locations. Incident offshore and incident broken wave heights measured using wire resistance and ultrasonic wave gages, and velocity was measured using acoustic-Doppler velocimeters. Force and pressure profiles were measured using load cells and pressure transducers. At each cross-shore location, the force and pressure profiles showed an impulse peak followed by a period of sustained force. This type of profile was seen for each wave height tested, and as expected as wave height increased the value of the <b>maximum</b> <b>impulse</b> force also increased. By examining force time histories, it was also found that while the hydrostatic pressure distribution accurately depicted the force profile during the period of sustained force it was significantly less reliable during the impact period. It was found that as the rigid wall was moved further offshore the peaks were less pronounced and the corresponding <b>maximum</b> <b>impulse</b> force values decreased. Thus, as the wall was moved onshore the loading scenario transitioned from impact to a quasi-steady bore-like loading condition. The sustained forces measured experimentally verified the empirical formula for steady state force presented by Iizuka and Matsutomi (2000). This theoretical formula was also presented by both the FEMA Coastal Construction Manual (2000) and the City of Honolulu Building Code (2003) as the “hydrodynamic force. ...|$|E

In this paper, three IRAs with ellipsoidal reflectors (elliptic IRAs) are numerically analyzed and compared with an IRA with a typical parabolic reflector (parabolic IRA).

40|$|A {{series of}} three full-scale, nearly-conventional, curtain wall {{specimens}} were blast tested in the open arena of the Infrastructure Security and Emergency Responder Research and Training (ISERRT) Facility in Gastonia, NC. The specimens were subjected to low-level blast loads produced from the detonation of high explosives. Low-level blast loads, similar to those produced during the tests, are typical of small charge weights (i. e. satchel charges) at short-to-moderate standoffs. A simple finite element (FE) model that effectively represents the nonlinear dynamic response of glass curtain walls subjected to blast loads was developed, and simulation results were compared with the test results. It was shown that, with the judicious choice of modeling parameters, the FE model effectively represents the response of glass curtain walls subjected to blast loads while being computationally economi-cal.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{test facility}} {{has been developed}} for performing laboratory studies on shallow buried blast loading. The shock tube based test facility offers an alternative method for generating blast wave in a controlled and repeatable manner, {{without the use of}} explosives. In this paper, we consider a spherical expanding blast wave of moderate shock strength with relatively low driving pressure. A confined dry sand bed prepared with a constant density, is exposed to a blast wave from the embedded shock tube. The principal objective {{of this paper is to}} understand the various events involved during the interaction of leading blast wave with the soil medium, followed by the expansion of the entrained gas. The process initiates with the formation of stress wave in the sand media, followed by the gas bubble expansion and terminates with sand ejection. The variation in the output of the sand ejecta is investigated with the help of high speed photography. The velocity of the sand ejecta front is found to decrease with the increase in the burial depth (DoB). Further, the impulse (using vertical pendulum) and peak pressure (using transducers) imparted to the rigid target are evaluated. The target is located at different stand-off distances (SoD) above the top surface of the sand bed. It is found that the peak pressure values are influenced by the presence of dome-cap of the ejecta, expanding vertically upwards generating a point-load impact. Irrespective of the depth of burial (DoB = 32 mm- 64 mm), <b>maximum</b> <b>impulse</b> is observed around the zone of bubble expansion (close to the sand bed surface). Sand ejecta does however have a greater influence on the impulse at higher SoDs (> 40 mm). Moreover, the maximum momentum transfer is observed when SoD to DoB ratio is 2. 5. In conclusion, the shock-driven sand test facility is found to be a simple and efficient tool to study the complex dynamics of sand ejecta, including the post- impact on the target structures.

40|$|Blast loading {{events that}} arise from the {{detonation}} of explosives pose a severe threat {{to the lives of}} civilians and military personnel alike. Such dangers typical of a detonation event include {{but are not limited to}} an intense, sudden initial pressure spike, extreme temperatures due to the burning of gases released by the explosive, and damage to the integrity of surrounding structures. It is therefore the purpose of the studies detailed in this manuscript to investigate various methods of mitigating the dangers posed by shock loading, as well as to investigate a novel impact mitigation device. ^ To address the danger presented by high velocity glass fragments generated by windows that have failed due to shock loading, a study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of coated laminated safety glass panels’ ability to contain glass fragments when subject to shock loading over a range of temperature conditions. Using a shock tube apparatus, fully clamped specimens were loaded under room temperature (25 °C), low temperatures (- 10 and 0 °C), and high temperatures (50, 80, 110 °C). For each experiment, the incident and reflected shock wave pressure profiles were recorded and three-dimensional Digital Image Correlation was used to analyze high-speed images and compute the full-field deformation, in-plane strains, and velocities during the blast-loading event. A post-mortem study of the sandwich specimen was performed to investigate the effectiveness of such materials under different temperatures to withstand these shock loads. The composite panel showed great endurance during the blast loading for temperatures from 0 to 80 °C, however was unable to contain glass fragments at - 10 °C and 110 °C. ^ A new system was designed to mitigate the impact forces during a collision using shock loading. The device consists of a cylindrical composite bladder sealed on one end by an inflation valve and on the other by an aluminum sheet of variable thickness. The bladder is pressurized and as an impactor nears the device, it strikes a striker-needle which ruptures the aluminum sheet, thus producing a shockwave just prior to impact. This produced shock wave decelerates the impactor and creates momentum (impulse) opposing that impulse transmitted from the impactor. Drop weight experiments were performed to show the applicability of this anti-shock device in reducing the momentum of the incoming body. A range of variables including needle length, bladder pressure, impact velocity, and drop mass were tested to better understand the processes involved. Time lapse photography coupled with 2 D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used to obtain the striker full field motion data during the drop-weight experiments. It was found that the device effectively mitigates impact for higher impact velocities and for higher bladder pressures, decreasing peak loads during impact by up to 58 % and energy imparted on the structure by 40 %. ^ An experimental study was also conducted to examine the induced pressure from the interaction of a planar shock front and perforated plates under fixed and free-standing boundary conditions using the shock-tube facility. Two series of experiments with variations in the blockage ratio, net hydraulic diameter, shapes, and sizes of the orifices, were conducted. During each experiment, pressure histories caused by the interaction of the incident shock wave with the plates were recorded. During the fluid structure interaction time, the side-view images of the targets were recorded using a single high-speed camera to identify the motion response of each plate configuration. The influence of varying the incident shock wave Mach number on the pressure profile was examined under clamped boundary conditions. The experimental results show that as the blockage ratio of the freestanding perforated plate decreased from 100 % to 65 %, the reflected peak pressure decreased by 26 %, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>impulse</b> imparted to the perforated plate decreased by 33 %. During the fluid-structure interaction process, as the blockage ratio of the freestanding perforated plate decreased from 100 % to 65 %, the plate’s momentum, velocity and kinetic energy decreased by approximately 60 %, 61 %, and 84 % respectively. ^ Finally, investigations were conducted to investigate the performance of different surface roughness (Ra) of 1018 mild low carbon steel panels under blast loading. Specimens were machined to have three different surface finishes of 0. 8, 1. 4, and 5. 0 µm. The shock tube apparatus was utilized to generate controlled blast loadings on simply supported specimens. For each experiment, incident and reflected shock wave pressure profiles were recorded, and three-dimensional Digital Image Correlation was used to analyze high-speed images and compute the full-field deformation, in-plane strains, and velocities during the blast loading event. In addition, another high speed camera was utilized to record the side-view deformation images and this information was used to validate the data obtained from the 3 D stereovision DIC technique. The results indicated that the impulse imparted to the plate decreased as the surface roughness increased from 0. 8 µm to 5. 0 µm. Due to this impulse reduction along with high surface roughness, the plates demonstrated a decrease in back face deflection, in-plane strain and out-of-plane velocity. ...|$|E

Parameters included were specific impulse, combustion-chamber temperature, nozzle exit temperature, composition mean molecular weight, characteristic velocity, coefficient of thrust and ratio of nozzle-exit area to throat area. For chamber pressure of 300 pounds per square inch absolute and expansion to 1 atmosphere, <b>maximum</b> specific <b>impulse</b> was 295. 8 pound-seconds per pound. Five percent by weight of water in the hydrazine lowered specific impulse from about one to three units over a wide range of weight-percent fuel...|$|R
