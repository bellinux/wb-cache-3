40|$|The {{government}} of Malawi in 2004 initiated an ICT-based Malawi Agricultural Commodity Exchange (MACE), a market information service project, to improve access by farmers to market information. MACE {{was intended to}} improve the efficiency of agricultural markets {{as part of the}} strategy to improve food security. This study uses quantitative methods to examine whether MACE has contributed to efficiency of rice markets in <b>Malawi.</b> It <b>especially</b> tests if MACE has contributed to spatial integration of rice markets. As hypothesized, the study finds that the tendency of rice prices to move together in spatially separated markets has significantly increased since the implementation of MACE. It concludes that ICT-based market information services improve the efficiency with which agricultural markets perform. The study discusses implications of this finding for policy.

The programme ran from 2012 – 2015 and had two key outcomes: improving the enabling environment for renewable energy and improving access rates to affordable and appropriate energy for poor Malawians. Much of the emphasis of MREAP has been on demonstrating and improving the model for community energy in <b>Malawi,</b> <b>especially</b> in rural areas where electricity access rates are only 1 %.

40|$|Apprenticeship in {{developed}} and industrialised nations is increasingly {{understood as a}} theory of learning which connects workplace activity and formal study. The concept of ‘expansive apprenticeship’ defines frameworks for workforce development where participants acquire knowledge and skills which will help {{them in the future}} as well as in their current roles, whilst ‘restrictive’ apprenticeships limit opportunities for wider, lifelong learning. In developing nations apprenticeship is a traditional route to learning and employment, but apprenticeships in these contexts tend to reflect a restrictive approach characterized by narrowly defined roles and weak educational outcomes. This paper examines a project in Malawi which uses concepts of expansive apprenticeship to address barriers to female continuing education and chronic teacher shortages. The Malawi Access to Teaching Scholarship recruited one thousand women to follow a year-long combined programme of academic distance study and practical work experience in rural primary schools. The aim is to increase the numbers of women teachers in <b>Malawi,</b> <b>especially</b> in rural areas. The Scholarship materials and support structures are designed to move participants from restrictive to expansive contexts for learning so that Scholars develop hybrid roles as students, community workers and apprentice pedagogues. The programme’s resources and approach offer an innovative model of expansive apprenticeship in Sub Saharan Africa...|$|E
40|$|This {{comparative}} study addresses {{the possibility to}} achieve climate change education (CCE) of good quality in teacher training colleges (TTCs) in Malawi. As {{one of the poorest}} countries in the world, together with being heavily reliant on agriculture for both survival and development, <b>Malawi</b> is <b>especially</b> vulnerable to the effects of global warming. There is an urgent need for developing capacity to respond and adapt to these issues, which the educational sector can contribute to. What kind of knowledge and capacity is considered relevant, and how well prepared is the education system for integrating CCE into the teaching? As an education system only is as good as its teachers, this study is set out to explore the possibilities for achieving CCE of good quality in three TTCs. The Government of Malawi is currently implementing climate change learning into the education system, making this study feasible and appropriate. A qualitative multiple case study has been carried out on three TTCs around Malawi. The primary focus has been teachers’ and administrators’ knowledge and perceptions on climate change, as well as their perceptions on the current teaching practice. Data was collected through focus group and semi-structured interviews with educators, administrative staff, second year students and key informants, as well as through fieldwork observations and secondary analysis. Data was gathered during a six week fieldwork period. The analysis has been guided by UNESCOs framework for understanding quality, combined with a locally adapted framework for understanding climate change knowledge in the Malawian context. The main findings indicate that most of the respondents in all three cases share similar views on climate change: displaying knowledge attached to what is considered locally relevant and an urge to expand their teaching practice on the topic. Teachers’ perceptions on their classroom practice suggested a gap between the intended and implemented contemporary curriculum. All colleges met the same type of perceived challenges in their current teaching on environmental issues, although they faced different financial prerequisites. Both college and individual level indicate a promising foundation for building CCE capacity, but for quality CCE to be achieved, colleges need to start timely and the topic must {{be a part of the}} national assessment. CCE alone cannot overcome the threats of climate change. A holistical approach is needed, where national contextual issues are tackled simultaneously. In regards to strengthening climate change capacity through the education system, the biggest obstacles are found on primary level...|$|R
40|$|We firstly {{discuss a}} {{framework}} for improving the traditional building techniques currently used for housing in Sub-Saharan Africa countries, illustrating the main building types found in such regions and <b>especially</b> <b>Malawi,</b> as typical example of such states: Yomata, a cylindrical floor-plan with mud and bamboo walls, Mdindo a rectangular wood-bamboo and compacted earthen structure and Zidina, a one or two-storey rectangular layout made of unbaked blocks compacted earthen structure and wood. We then present a proposal for providing greater seismic resistance to such traditional buildings {{through the application of}} a light-weight roof. The structural problem considered regards the addition of a light, seismic roof to provide wider spans and more interior space to the above-mentioned building types. The proposal calls for erecting a reticular bamboo beam system with the help of small stainless steel plates. By combining modern engineering technologies (efficient stainless-steel elements to achieve a heightened degree of connection between the bamboo beams) with traditional African techniques and materials (spontaneous no-cost bamboo production and handcrafted building components) it is possible to achieve a high-performance roof with satisfactory levels of safety and durability. The system proposed consists of a classical Polanceau (Fink truss) or Palladian (King-post truss) reticular scheme, in which the traditional natural fibre connections are replaced by steel plates jointed by a screw system. Such jointing improves the seismic performance of traditional housing by increasing the degree of transverse connection of the building tops, without however causing any significant changes in inertial forces. The scheme moreover permits increasing roof spans, and thereby obtaining more comfortable interior spaces. The criteria for the design and assembly of such structures are illustrated in order to demonstrate their feasibility and sustainability from the economic and technical perspectives...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} realization {{of the significance of}} Indigenous knowledge (IK) in achieving sustainability. Education is also considered a primary agent in moving toward sustainability. However, research that explores education focused on sustainability in <b>Malawi</b> is sparse, <b>especially</b> where the roles of IK and youth perspectives have been considered. This research draws on the concepts of uMunthu, Sankofa, and postcolonial theory to enable a “third space” (Bhabha, 1994) centred on culturally appropriate Malawian ways of knowing working in tandem with non-Indigenous knowledge and practice. Three main questions guide the study: (1) How do participants understand place and environmental sustainability in relation to knowledge and practice (both Indigenous and non-Indigenous) ?; (2) Within the context of Chinduzi village, the Junior Farmer Field and Life Skills School (JFFLS) program, and its engagement with issues of environmental sustainability, what forms of knowledge and practice are evident (both Indigenous and non-Indigenous) ?; and (3) What are participants’ views on how environmental sustainability should be further engaged in the JFFLS program in relation to knowledge and practice (both Indigenous and non-Indigenous) ? Data collection methods included focus groups, place mapping, individual conversations, observations, and archival documents review. The data were coded using inductive analysis and the research employed aspects of participatory research and Indigenous research methodologies. The research findings reveal that while there is general consensus among the participants supporting youth learning IK in school, others are not supportive because they consider IK to be inferior. In considering place and environmental sustainability, the findings revealed that participating Elders describe their sense of place in terms of historical agriculture-related knowledge and practice. On the other hand, participating youth express their sense of place in drawings of their favourite places. The drawings revealed that youth are largely rooted in their social-cultural interactions within their community, but also influenced by global culture. The study results show that the JFFLS curriculum includes both Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledge and practice in both agriculture-related and life skills lessons. To achieve environmental sustainability in the community, participants recommend all youth in the community learn local Indigenous knowledge and practices for protecting the environment...|$|R
