30|$|Detailed {{assessment}} {{of this problem}} is not {{the scope of this}} study, but our results clearly show that this problem is very serious for volcanic plume chemistry measurements using the <b>MultiGAS.</b> In the <b>MultiGAS</b> measurements, a constant atmospheric composition is implicitly assumed for estimating concentration ratios of volcanic gas species. For gas species common in both volcanic gas and atmosphere such as CO 2 and H 2 O, difference in ambient air compositions near the vent and at observation site causes over estimation of volcanic gas ratios at one time but does under estimation at other times. This problem is negligible for volcanic gas ratios between gas species, which have ignorable amount in the atmosphere such as SO 2, H 2 S and HCl.|$|E

Flexibility in implementing climate change mitigation policies can significantly reduce mitigation costs and has three dimensions; space, time and gas species. Therefore, multiple greenhouse gas reduction flexibility should be considered. The emission and reduction potential of CO 2 and non-CO 2 GHGs are assessed here using an integrated assessment model under climate change targets. The implications on gas life as well as abatement timing uncertainty on costs, technological availability, etc. are discussed. The introduction of additional <b>multigas</b> reductions will cut the economic burden of achieving a given climate change target. The conclusions are threefold; (1) <b>Multigas</b> mitigation is a cost effective strategy compared to CO 2 -only mitigation under the same climate target, (2) CO 2 mitigation is expected to lead to ancillary reductions in CH 4, N 2 O and SOx emissions, and (3) There is great uncertainty in the assessment of non-CO 2 GHG mitigation opportunities. ...|$|E
40|$|Cavity-enhanced Raman <b>multigas</b> {{spectrometry}} {{is introduced}} as a versatile technique for monitoring of 13 CO 2 isotope labeling experiments, while simultaneously quantifying the fluxes of O 2 and other relevant gases {{across a wide}} range of concentrations. The <b>multigas</b> analysis was performed in a closed cycle; no gas was consumed, and the gas composition was not altered by the measurement. Isotope labeling of plant metabolites via photosynthetic uptake of 13 CO 2 enables the investigation of resource flows in plants and is now an important tool in ecophysiological studies. In this experiment the 13 C labeling of monoclonal cuttings of Populus trichocarpa was undertaken. The high time resolution of the online <b>multigas</b> analysis allowed precise control of the pulse labeling and was exploited to calculate the kinetics of photosynthetic 13 CO 2 uptake and to extrapolate the exact value of the 13 CO 2 peak concentration in the labeling chamber. Further, the leaf dark respiration of immature and mature leaves was analyzed. The quantification of the photosynthetic O 2 production rate as a byproduct of the 13 CO 2 uptake correlated with the amount of available light and the leaf area of the plants in the labeling chamber. The ability to acquire CO 2 and O 2 respiration rates simultaneously also simplifies the determination of respiratory quotients (rate of O 2 uptake compared to CO 2 release) and thus indicates the type of combusted substrate. By combining quantification of respiration quotients with the tracing of 13 C in plants, cavity enhanced Raman spectroscopy adds a valuable new tool for studies of metabolism at the organismal to ecosystem scale...|$|E

Gas analyzers make it possible to retrieve in real-time the chemical composition of a fumarole system or a plume in an open-conduit volcano via periodic field-deployments or at permanent stations. The core of a multicomponent volcanic gas analyzer (<b>MultiGAS)</b> consists of spectroscopic and electrochemical sensors that are used to determine the concentrations of the most abundant volcanic gases (H 2 O, CO 2, SO 2, H 2 S, H 2, CO and HCl) in a diluted plume and their mutual molar ratios. Processing such data is often difficult due to the high sensitivity of the sensors to environmental conditions such as humidity, gas concentrations, and pressure, with all involving occasional instrumental drift. Analyses require accurate and time-consuming processing by an operator. This paper presents a stand-alone program for the processing of chemical data obtained using the <b>MultiGAS,</b> called Ratiocalc.

The advantage of using UAVs in volcanology, especially in volcanic plume monitoring, is significant {{to avoid the}} risks of researchers and to obtain data from unapproachable locations such as inside a dense plume or an active crater. The first pioneering work using a remote-controlled engine helicopter for volcanic plume measurement was carried out at La Fossa Crater, Vulcano, Italy, measuring SO 2 flux with a miniature UV spectrometer and CO 2 /SO 2 ratio with a simplified <b>MultiGAS</b> (McGonigle et al. 2008). Shinohara (2013) made <b>MultiGAS</b> measurements with a fixed-wing UAV for the volcanic plume of Shinmoedake volcano, Japan, during a repeating Vulcanian eruption stage. For volcanoes with hydrothermal influence, monitoring of both SO 2 and H 2 S in volcanic plumes is important. Unlike SO 2, remote monitoring of H 2 S is currently impossible, and thus, measurement of H 2 S for highly active volcanoes is generally difficult. The use of UAVs is expected to overcome such difficulties more simply and safely.|$|E

In this contribution, a fiber-enhanced Raman spectroscopic (FERS) {{analysis of a}} suite of climate relevant atmospheric gases is presented, which allowed for reliable quantification of CH 4, CO 2, and N 2 O alongside N 2 and O 2 with just one single measurement. A highly improved analytical sensitivity was achieved, down to a sub-parts per million limit of detection with a high dynamic range of 6 orders of magnitude and within a second measurement time. The high potential of FERS {{for the detection of}} disease markers was demonstrated with the analysis of 27 nL of exhaled human breath. The natural isotopes 13 CO 2 and 14 N 15 N were quantified at low levels, simultaneously with the major breath components N 2, O 2, and 12 CO 2.

Our project {{contributes to the}} ongoing work on improving Hekla’s monitoring and early warning systems. In 2012 we began monitoring gas release at Hekla. The dataset comprises semi-permanent near-real time measurements with a <b>MultiGAS</b> system, quantification of diffuse gas flux, and direct samples analysed for composition and isotopes (δ 13 C, δD and δ 18 O). In addition, we used reaction path modelling to derive information on the origin and reaction pathways of the gas emissions. Hekla’s quiescent gas composition was CO 2 -dominated (0. 8 mol fraction) and the δ 13 C signature was consistent with published values for Icelandic magmas. The gas is poor in H 2 O and S compared to hydrothermal manifestations and syn-eruptive emissions from other active volcanic systems in Iceland. The total CO 2 flux from Hekla central volcano (diffuse soil emissions) is at least 44 T d− 1, thereof 14 T d− 1 are sourced from a small area at the volcano’s summit. There was no detectable gas flux at other craters, {{even though some of}} them had higher ground temperatures and had erupted more recently. Our measurements are consistent with a magma reservoir at depth coupled with a shallow dike beneath the summit. In the current quiescent state, the composition of the exsolved gas is substantially modified along its pathway to the surface through cooling and interaction with wall-rock and groundwater. The modification involves both significant H 2 O condensation and scrubbing of S-bearing species, leading to a CO 2 -dominated gas emitted at the summit.

Growth of these bacteria cannot be monitored using conventional turbidity-based optical density measurements due to concomitant mineral formation in the medium. The respiratory activity of carbonate-precipitating Arthrobacter sulfonivorans, isolated from the recently discovered Herrenberg Cave, was investigated during its lifecycle by means of innovative cavity-enhanced Raman gas analysis. This method allowed rapid and nonconsumptive online quantification of CO 2 and O 2 in situ in the headspace of the bacterial culture.

Further insight into the biomineralization process over time was provided by a combination of Raman macro- and microspectroscopy. With the help of this spatially resolved chemical imaging of the different types of calcium carbonate minerals, it was elucidated that the surface of the A. sulfonivorans bacterial cells served as nuclei for biomineralization of initially spherical vaterite precipitates. These vaterite biominerals continued growing as chemically stable rock-forming calcite crystals with rough edges.

In contrast, there is no practical way to measure H 2 S from a remote distance from the plume. Although remote FTIR observation for volcanic gas (e.g., Mori and Notsu 1997; Burton et al. 2000) can measure many volcanic gas species including SO 2 from a safe distance, there has been no report of H 2 S detection (Oppenheimer et al. 2011). Thus, at least for measuring SO 2 /H 2 S ratio, there is no other practical way except for in-plume direct measurements. <b>MultiGAS</b> (Shinohara 2005; Aiuppa et al. 2005 a, b) or VERP (Kelly et al. 2013) that are equipped by electrochemical SO 2 and H 2 S sensors is suitable systems to measure SO 2 /H 2 S ratio inside the plume. For example, VERP onboard manned aircraft was used for measuring volcanic gas chemistry including SO 2 /H 2 S ratios inside the eruptive plume of Redoubt volcano (Werner et al. 2013). However, measurements using a manned aircraft into volcanic plumes are quite limited considering safety concerns and should be replaced if supplemental methods are available.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTPurposeThe {{introduction}} of flue gas denitrification technologies by {{selective catalytic reduction}} (SCR) or selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) in coal fired plants resulted in an increase of ammonia content in fly ash. The utilization of fly ash in fire and ventilation prevention of hard coal mines causes the release of ammonia from a fly ash-water mixture. In the applied technology of the ash and water mixture, ammonia in gaseous form is discharged and mixes with the air flowing through the mine airways. In this article, reference is made to the risk assessment of gaseous ammonia in the longwall area during {{the application of the}} fly ash-water mixture to the gobs in the U-tube ventilation system. MethodsThe test methods include: ammonia release from ash and water mixtures at various temperatures and in respect to different proportions of water to ash with use of a <b>multigas</b> analyzer with an FTIR detector. ResultsThe results of the laboratory tests helped to determine the size of the ammonia stream released from the fly ash-water mixture in respect to different ratios of water to ash. Practical implicationsLaboratory studies allow for ventilation and gaseous analysis to assess the level of ammonia risk, in the mine airways, from exhaust air discharged from the longwall area. Originality/valueBased on the literature review, this type of research has not been carried out so far...|$|E
40|$|The 2014 – 2015 Bárðarbunga fissure {{eruption}} at Holuhraun in central Iceland was distinguished {{by the high}} emission of gases, in total 9. 6 Mt SO 2, with almost no tephra. This work collates all ground-based measurements of this extraordinary eruption cloud made under particularly challenging conditions: remote location, optically dense cloud with high SO 2 column amounts, low UV intensity, frequent clouds and precipitation, an extensive and hot lava field, developing ramparts, and high-latitude winter conditions. Semi-continuous measurements of SO 2 flux with three scanning DOAS instruments were augmented by car traverses along the ring-road and along the lava. The ratios of other gases/SO 2 were measured by OP-FTIR, <b>MultiGAS,</b> and filter packs. Ratios of SO 2 /HCl = 30 – 110 and SO 2 /HF = 30 – 130 show a halogen-poor eruption cloud. Scientists on-site reported extremely minor tephra production during the eruption. OPC and filter packs showed low particle concentrations similar to non-eruption cloud conditions. Three weather radars detected a droplet-rich eruption cloud. Top of eruption cloud heights of 0. 3 – 5. 5 km agl were measured with ground- and aircraft-based visual observations, web camera and NicAIR II infrared images, triangulation of scanning DOAS instruments, {{and the location of}} SO 2 peaks measured by DOAS traverses. Cloud height and emission rate measurements were critical for initializing gas dispersal simulations for hazard forecasting...|$|E
