5|$|Chrono Resurrection, {{also known}} as Chrono Trigger: Resurrection, is an {{unreleased}} fangame developed by North American team Resurrection Games under Nathan Lazur's direction. It {{is based on the}} critically acclaimed Super NES role-playing game Chrono Trigger by the Japanese company Square. The project was initially called CT64 and was <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> complete remake of the original game for the Nintendo 64, with both 2D and 3D playing modes.|$|E
5|$|Chocolina was {{originally}} <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> waitress in Serendipity, but her design impressed Toriyama {{enough that he}} expanded her role into something akin to a shop clerk, and the director wrote a new backstory and new dialogue for her. Isamu Kamikokuryo said that though Chocolina's jovial manner and scanty outfit at times clashed with the game's overall atmosphere, he felt {{she was a good}} inclusion. Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|It {{may be that}} in {{the mind}} of their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols were never meant {{to be more than a}} nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old épater la bourgeoisie. It may also be that {{in the mind of}} their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though in}} the past they <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> anti-guerrilla unit, today they are {{oriented}} towards anti-terrorism, anti-kidnapping and anti-narcotics efforts, in line with current needs.|$|R
50|$|Blood {{donation}} {{camps are}} also organised by NCYS on Good Friday every year, {{in association with}} local blood banks like Rotary Club. It <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> act of following Jesus symbolically, as Christians believe that He also shed his blood on the cross for others.|$|R
50|$|His {{next project}} <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> action-oriented {{adaptation}} of John Milton's 17th-century Christian epic poem Paradise Lost, starring Bradley Cooper. Both Proyas and Cooper <b>were</b> on hand <b>to</b> debut concept art at ComicCon 2011, but {{the project was}} ultimately cancelled over budgetary concerns related to the effects.|$|R
5|$|Risk is {{the eighth}} studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on August 31, 1999 by Capitol Records, the band's last album {{to be released}} by the label. The first Megadeth album since 1990 to feature a lineup change, Risk marks the studio debut of drummer Jimmy DeGrasso with the band, {{as well as the}} final appearance of longtime guitarist Marty Friedman, who announced his departure a year later. <b>Meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> breakthrough on alternative rock radio, Risk received a mixed response because of the great deviation from the band's traditional sound. The backlash ultimately resulted with the band returning towards a heavier sound with its next album.|$|E
5|$|That's how I {{wanted to}} open the video, because I think it really sets {{up the rest of}} the story. It allows you to imagine you {{yourself}} are not just one person; you're so many. That person has so many stories and memories to draw from, and they all affect your journey profusely. I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, but at the end, I'm not battered; I'm a bit strange. It's not meant to be an answer video; it's <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> profuse number of the question.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} never <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> true biographical film to Ip Man's life, but to broadly {{touch on the}} {{elements}} from his life. Most of the central turns of the plot are there only {{for the purpose of}} making a movie more exciting, including the scenes depicting duels between Ip Man and the Japanese, including Consul General Miura Yoshiaki (三浦義秋), as well as Ip Man encountering hardship during the Second Sino-Japanese War.|$|E
40|$|Mathematical and {{statistical}} models {{can serve as}} tools for understanding the epidemiology of human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome if they are constructed carefully. This article <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> introduction <b>to</b> AIDS-related mathematical biology for scientists with a non-mathematical background. An applicable dynamical model is also explained...|$|R
50|$|Explaining {{the end of}} the {{original}} magazine: Crew 22 <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> issue of {{the original}} Crew comics magazine, yet it never was published and Veverka sold the Logo back to the original team. Also, all the comics (except for Understanding Comics's second part) were published in the new magazine.|$|R
50|$|Grounds for Marriage <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> escapist fare, distracting {{people from}} the Korean War. The film was {{generally}} received mildly, attracting only little attention and earning only little money. MGM records state that the movie earned $1,116,000 in the US and Canada and $471,000 elsewhere, resulting {{in a loss of}} $168,000.|$|R
5|$|After {{more than}} a year since the band's last concert, Megadeth {{returned}} as a live act in June 1997, beginning a world tour with the Misfits and touring in the United States with Life of Agony and Coal Chamber. In July, the band participated in Ozzfest '98 but, halfway through the tour, Menza reportedly discovered a tumor on his knee and left to undergo surgery. Jimmy DeGrasso, who had collaborated with Mustaine in MD.45, was hired to replace Menza {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Though initially <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> temporary replacement, DeGrasso joined the band permanently after the tour. Mustaine later said that he dismissed Menza from the band because he believed the drummer had lied about having cancer.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the race's {{first week}} and {{beginning}} of its second were three hilly medium-mountain stages. These stages took the Giro through Austria and Switzerland before returning to Italy. Each of these stages took more than five hours to complete, and the rain that fell each day combined with the difficulties presented by the numerous ascents and descents made the courses potentially unsafe in the riders' opinion. This opinion was perhaps validated by the life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo in the eighth stage after he crashed while descending a mountain. While the ninth stage was <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> showy criterium in celebration of this being the 100th anniversary of the Giro d'Italia, the riders collectively protested the safety conditions of that stage and the ones before it. This meant it would be neutralized, with every rider receiving the same finishing time as the stage winner regardless of when they finished.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} Hironobu Sakaguchi {{stated that}} {{the idea for the}} game first came up in February 1997. The original idea for Brave Fencer Musashi was having Miyamoto Musashi fighting in an alternate world from where he belonged. While the game conceptualized as an action oriented, Musashi was originally <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> wanderer. However, he was later changed to an itinerant Samaritan in order to have him interacting and helping other characters. During development, the team used an action base which was crucial to the game's fighting mechanics. Director Yoichi Yoshimoto was focused on the game's fully polygonal aspects that were a departure from Square's previous works. The development team prioritized the movement of polygons in real time and how light affected their appearance.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the center}} <b>was</b> {{originally}} <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> education center first, and an entertainment center second {{it has not}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> success at either. [...] Youth programming has been scarce and the performance calendar has <b>been</b> sparse. <b>As</b> a result it has failed to lure the anticipated amount of tourism to the neighborhood.|$|R
40|$|We present {{examples}} and diagrams illustrating the proofs appearing in "Real second-order freeness and the asymptotic real second-order freeness of several real matrix models", {{to which this}} paper <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> appendix. We show how matrix calculations may be represented by topological surface gluings, which may in turn be represented as permutations...|$|R
50|$|Fantastic {{architecture}} {{should not}} be confused with Novelty architecture. While both styles have unusual, attention-grabbing designs, novelty architecture <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> advertisement for the business inside, such as buildings with a giant donut on the roof. Fantastic architecture, on the other hand, serves no other purpose than the personal amusement of its builder.|$|R
5|$|Having seized Emesa, the Muslims {{were just}} a march away from Aleppo, a Byzantine stronghold, and Antioch, where Heraclius resided. Seriously alarmed by the series of setbacks, Heraclius {{prepared}} for a counterattack to reacquire the lost regions. In 635 Yazdegerd III, the Emperor of Persia, sought an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor. Heraclius married off his daughter (according to traditions, his grand daughter) Manyanh to Yazdegerd III, to cement the alliance. While Heraclius prepared for a major offensive in the Levant, Yazdegerd was to mount a simultaneous counterattack in Iraq, in what was <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> well-coordinated effort. When Heraclius launched his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd could not coordinate with the maneuver—probably owing to the exhausted condition of his government—and {{what would have been}} a decisive plan missed the mark.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} plans {{involving a}} rapid transit circle line in Oslo, connecting the newly built hospital Rikshospitalet {{with the rest}} of the city. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. In the local newspaper Aftenposten Aften there was a debate on whether there should be a ring line from Berg along the National Road 150 towards Gaustad over Rikshospitalet, or whether the Ullevål Hageby Line should be extended from John Colletts plass to Rikshospitalet, thereby creating a correspondence with the Sognsvann Line at the new station Forskningsparken. In the first plans, Berg was <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> station on the new ring line. This plan was discarded since local residents feared noise pollution and destroyed lawns. Even though Berg was not made a station on the Ring Line, noise shields were put up along the Sognsvann Line.|$|E
5|$|Kipandjikusmin {{later wrote}} to Ekspres {{magazine}} that his goal {{in writing the}} short story was to expose the corruption in Sukarno's government, focusing on the religious leaders who had agreed with Nasakom when it was politically expedient to do so, yet turned against the PKI when the party was hunted and its members killed. He also admitted the influences proposed by Jassin, writing that he had often thought of the Catholic heaven as being similar to the Javanese Kahyangan, with God being similar to Batara Guru. His depictions of Muhammad and Gabriel transforming into eagles were influenced by images of Christ as the Lamb of God. It was originally <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> serial, and Jassin had already received the second instalment {{by the time the}} controversy began.|$|E
25|$|Local kings often invited temple dancers {{to dance}} in their courts, the {{occurrence}} of which created a new category of dancers, rajadasis, and modified the technique and themes of the recitals. A devadasi had to satisfy her own soul while she danced unwatched and offered herself to the god, but the rajadasi's dance <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> entertainment.|$|R
2500|$|The West Side Line of the New York Central Railroad {{once had}} on-street running along part of Eleventh Avenue, popularly called [...] "Death Avenue" [...] {{because of the}} large number of deaths that {{occurred}} due to train–pedestrian collisions. In 1934, <b>a</b> bill <b>was</b> passed for the Henry Hudson Parkway <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constructed, <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> alternative route <b>to</b> [...] "Death Avenue".|$|R
50|$|After {{the success}} of Albert Balink's Terang Boelan in 1937 and The Teng Chun's Alang-Alang in 1939, four new film studios were started. One of these, Oriental Film, signed Njoo and Young; Njoo <b>was</b> taken as <b>a</b> writer, while Young <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> actress. This <b>was</b> part of <b>a</b> general {{movement}} bringing stage personnel into the film industry.|$|R
5|$|Queen Victoria had {{instructed}} the War Office {{to strike a}} new medal that would not recognise birth or class. The medal was <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> simple decoration that would be highly prized and eagerly sought after by those in the military services. To maintain its simplicity, Queen Victoria, {{under the guidance of}} Prince Albert, vetoed the suggestion that the award be called The Military Order of Victoria and instead suggested the name Victoria Cross. The original warrant stated that the Victoria Cross would only be awarded to soldiers who have served {{in the presence of the}} enemy and had performed some signal act of valour or devotion. The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857 at which Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park, London.|$|E
5|$|Ralph and Vanellope build a kart, {{and they}} flee to Diet Cola Mountain, an {{unfinished}} race track. Learning that Vanellope cannot drive, Ralph helps teach her. King Candy hacks the game's code, obtaining Ralph's medal, which he offers {{to him in}} exchange for preventing Vanellope from racing. He explains that if Vanellope wins and becomes playable, her glitches would {{be brought to the}} attention of players, their game would be unplugged and Vanellope would die, unable to leave the game because she is a glitch. A reluctant Ralph agrees, trashing Vanellope's kart. He returns to his own game, but notices Vanellope's image on the side of the Sugar Rush cabinet, and realizes she was <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> playable character.|$|E
5|$|The album {{revealed}} {{a more personal}} side of the singer, illustrated in its declarative theme of emancipation from her previous marriage, and from her personal and professional setbacks. Although it shared similar vocal production {{as well as an}} inclination to her signature pop and R ballads, the album also encompassed a variety of dance-oriented and uptempo styles. It was <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> continuation, or a second part of her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Carey collaborated with a number of artists on the album, including T-Pain, Damian Marley and Young Jeezy. Though considered by critics very similar to the formula its predecessor had been built on, E=MC² included other genres she had never explored, such as reggae, and her continued recording of gospel-influenced hymns.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{and because}} of its popularity, the region <b>is</b> heavily {{protected}} <b>to</b> preserve the rural and natural character of the land. The Big Sur Local Coastal Program, approved by Monterey County Supervisors in 1981, states the region <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> experience that visitors transit through, not a destination. For that reason, development of all kinds is severely restricted.|$|R
2500|$|The {{game was}} {{reportedly}} not officially licensed, {{and despite the}} fact that it used the same logo as the show, the game's documentation states [...] "it <b>is</b> not <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> adaption of the television series". Consequently, a number of changes <b>were</b> made <b>to</b> distance the game from specific elements of the show while preserving its spirit and message: ...|$|R
2500|$|In April 2006, Macovei {{entered her}} flat to smell gas fumes filling her {{home from a}} nozzle that had {{apparently}} been turned or left on. [...] Police found no apparent explanation for the incident, although the possibility remained that it <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> attack on her. [...] The press reported that the government provided no special security for her residence.|$|R
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{exploration of}} the original Mass Effect was completely revamped. Instead of having large barren landscapes, the designers opted to build distinct and interesting places. The goal was to encourage players to keep exploring the galaxy by changing their expectations about what they could find. Originally, developers experimented {{with the idea of}} having a vehicle that could be used to navigate the planetary terrain in a more flexible way than in the original title. However, the vehicle was ultimately removed from the final build of the game. The context-sensitive interrupt system, which was originally <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> feature in the original Mass Effect, was introduced in Mass Effect 2 to help blend the dialogue better with the rest of the action.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{was fired}} from the band later that year due to musical differences, via a fax from {{keyboard}} player Roddy Bottum; and Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance {{was brought in to}} record their next album. However, Spruance left the band before the subsequent tour, and was replaced by the band's keyboard roadie, Dean Menta. Reasons given for the change differ—the band claim Spruance was unwilling to commit to a long touring schedule in support of the album, whilst Spruance claims he was never <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> permanent member in the first place. Roddy Bottum also claims to have been mostly absent during this period, owing to the deaths of his father and Kurt Cobain, whose wife Courtney Love was a close friend of his and one of the temporary lead singers of the band before Chuck Mosely joined. Bottum's absence led to the album being written largely without keyboards. Around the recording of the album in 1994, Mike Patton also got married to Italian woman Cristina Zuccatosta.|$|E
5|$|Nhill {{was always}} <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{temporary}} location for No.1 OTU, whose home {{was to be}} East Sale, also in Victoria. As accommodation at East Sale would not be available until October 1942, the school's 1,630 personnel were relocated to Bairnsdale in June and July. The base's living quarters, recreational buildings and 88 tents could not fully accommodate this influx, so the RAAF rented hotels in Bairnsdale for 320 airmen. On 10December 1942, No.1 OTU Detached Flight, consisting of 15 Hudsons and 108 personnel including air and maintenance crews, was sent to North-Eastern Area Command to help fulfill urgent transport requirements in New Guinea. This force joined a military Douglas DC-2 and eleven civil aircraft pressed into service to form RAAF Special Transport Flight, which operated out of Wards Airfield from 14December 1942 to 11January 1943. The Hudsons flew 645 sorties, carrying some 1,100 troops and almost 800 tons of equipment. Two of the Hudsons were lost, one to enemy action and one to friendly fire, and several were damaged.|$|E
