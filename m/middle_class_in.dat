5|$|BP in its 2017 Energy Outlook {{forecasts}} {{that the}} number of plug-in electric cars will rise from 1.2 million in 2015 to around 100 million by 2035 representing about 5.5% of the global fleet of passenger cars. Around 25% of these plug-in electric vehicles will be plug-in hybrids and 75% will be pure battery electric cars. The oil company also projects that automotive fuel demand for use in cars will continue to rise, despite efficiency improvements in conventional internal combustion engines and increased plug-in car adoption due to growth in demand for car travel from the growing <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>in</b> emerging economies.|$|E

Built and first operated by businessman Charles F. Brown, the building was bought in 1927 by Home Services Company, a power-laundry consortium. American Linen Supply and then Perfect Fit Manufacturing, a maker of automotive fabrics, used the building after Home Services sold it in 1950. Acquired by Alter LLC in 2008, the building is home to Yale Union (YU), a contemporary arts center.|$|E

Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{the south shore}} region of Lake Erie was a popular {{vacation}} destination for the emerging <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>in</b> the United States. The lake's islands, such as Kelleys Island and South Bass Island, were gaining a reputation for their freshwater bathing resorts. The Cedar Point peninsula, named for its abundance of cedar trees, was originally known for its fishing. Local fishermen leased land and built living quarters there. Sandusky, which featured an important shipping harbor and two railroads, transformed into a major economic center {{over the next three}} decades. Railroad and steamship travel supported an emerging tourism industry, and rapid development of the area began.|$|E
5|$|More people {{joined the}} <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s, {{with more money}} to spend, and the {{availability}} of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension of their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. Most businesses directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities. The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth of}} the new <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>in</b> Syria fueled discontent since the {{traditional}} elite dominated the agrarian sector – the largest {{sector of the economy}} – and created most of the wealth. The new middle class consisted of capitalists and entrepreneurs who opposed the traditional elite – the monopolisation of power by the traditional elite led to the radicalisation of the new middle class. The military, which in many countries is conservative and elitist, became radicalised in Syria because the military wanted greater power, believing that the traditional elite were unable to defend the country. A significant group of military personnel were recruited from the new middle class or from the hinterlands.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIndia has {{recently}} witnessed various initiatives that harness {{information and communication}} technologies (ICTs) to promote electoral reform and political mobilization. These efforts have been initiated mainly by non governmental organizations drawn from India's urban, English-speaking, upper and <b>middle</b> <b>classes.</b> These efforts have been focused on non-partisan process improvements or short-lived political mobilization with limited success. We analyze these initiatives against the backdrop of modern India's political evolution which has seen the marginalization of upper and <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> <b>in</b> politics. We see technology as central to the re-engagement of ICT-savvy upper and <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> with the political sphere.

25|$|Overall, {{many social}} critics and intellectuals, {{most of whom}} are members of the {{professional}} middle class themselves, have commented on the extravagant consumption habits of the professional middle class.

The increasing materialism, even among such a highly educated class, is also often claimed to be connected to the notion of rugged individualism which gained popularity among the ranks of the professional <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the population in Asia remains rural and poor, the growth of the <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>in</b> the region has been dramatic. For comparison, in 1990, the middle class grew by 9.7 percent in India and 8.6 percent in China, but by 2007 the growth rate was nearly 30 percent and 70 percent respectively. The corresponding increase in Asian affluence also brought with it a change in lifestyle and eating habits, particularly a demand for greater variety, leading to increased competition with western nations for already strained agricultural resources. This demand exacerbates dramatic increases in commodity prices such as oil.|$|E
