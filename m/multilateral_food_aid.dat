By examining patterns of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> distribution and resource allocation among groups of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> recipients and non-recipients, the article suggests that <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> has not encouraged dependency-like behaviors.

USAID uses the Bellmon analysis to determine the level of food that would have already been available on the market. The Bellmon analysis guidelines intend to ensure <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> provides, “no substantial disincentive to domestic production and marketing.” “Usual Market Requirements” used by <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> organizations, Bellmon analyses, and Title II funding aim to ensure that monetization of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> does not replace imports or displace local production completely.

Two forms of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> delivery are considered: first is project <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> under which <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> is used to finance infrastructure development and consumers are required to participate in public projects in order to receive food aid; the second is non-project <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> which we use to capture all forms of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> distributed to consumers free of charge. The model suggests that, when <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> is used to finance infrastructure development, it has no labor disincentive effects in the food industry, increases food security and decreases the level of unemployment in the recipient country. When <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> is distributed to consumers free of charge, however, the model predicts that it creates labor disincentive effects in the food industry, increases the unemployment level and decreases food security.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examined}} {{impacts of}} <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> on domestic <b>food</b> production employing a {{computable general equilibrium}} modelling technique and using data from Ethiopia. The simulation experiments have shown that <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> has unambiguous disincentive effects on domestic food production. The removal of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> caused a modest increase in food prices but this stimulated food production. Employment and income generation effects of the latter outweighed the adverse effect of the former. Consequently, the removal of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> led to improvements in aggregate household welfare. Contrary to some concerns in the <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> literature that any reduction in <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> would hurt the poor, the simulation experiments suggested that actually poor rural household and urban wage earners {{are the ones who}} benefit most in absence of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> but entrepreneurs are more likely to encounter a marginal welfare decline.

Although <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> can have negative unintended consequences, the empirical evidence is thin and often contradictory.
