5|$|In June 2008, Bolt {{responded to}} {{claims that he}} was a lazy athlete, saying that the {{comments}} were unjustified, and he trained hard to achieve his potential. However, he surmised that such comments stemmed from his lack of enthusiasm for the 400 metres event, and chose to not <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> train for distance running. Turning his efforts to the 200 m, Bolt proved that he could excel in multiple events—first setting the world-leading time in Ostrava, then breaking the national record for the second time with a 19.67 s finish in Athens, Greece. Although Mills still preferred that Bolt focus on the longer distances, the acceptance of Bolt's demand to run in the 100 m worked for both sprinter and trainer. Bolt was more focused in practice, and a training schedule to boost his top speed and his stamina, in preparation for the Olympics, had improved both his 100 m and 200 m times.|$|E

Since teenagers, [...] "the {{demographic}} with {{an excess}} of idle time in January," [...] are less interested in movies touted as potential Oscar winners than adults, Meslow reasons, studios <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> release films targeted to them. So, romantic films like She's All That, Save the Last Dance and A Walk to Remember have successfully opened in January. The low-budget parody films of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, such as Date Movie and Meet the Spartans, have also done well with the teen market in the dump months despite strongly negative reception from critics and audiences.|$|E

On September 15, the band made Daisy available to stream through Myspace. In promoting the album, as with previous album The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me, the band were very selective over which publications they would talk to, largely avoiding the American media altogether. The band also made the decision not to make conventional music videos, as well as ultimately only releasing one song as a single after scrapping the planned [...] "Sink" [...] single. Some publications speculated that Daisy would be the band's final album, claims which the band repeatedly denied.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the controversy surrounding its exposure of fascist biographies, the work also drew criticism for being too lenient on the political and cultural establishment of the 1930s. Historian Maria Bucur, who investigated the widespread advocacy of eugenics during the Romanian interwar, is skeptical about Ornea's claim that intellectual supporters of liberal democracy were clearly separated from and always outnumbered those who preached authoritarianism, arguing that her own study proves otherwise: [...] "The position of the Romanian eugenicists challenges this confidence in the support for democracy in interwar Romania. While {{a few of these}} individuals did identify directly with the extreme right, many more eugenicists considered themselves moderate [...] The spectrum of illiberalism was broader and less clearly identified with a marginal radical rightist position than Ornea suggests in his study." [...] Rizescu also finds flaw in the book's perceived search for centrist references, which, he claims, led Ornea to neglect the contribution of Marxists and peasantists active in the 1930s, and as such to avoid inaugurating an [...] "extensive interpretative revisions" [...] of interwar leftist ideas for a post-communist world. He notes: [...] "Indeed, while Tradiționalism și modernitate is broad and ambitious in scope, paying equal attention to social-economic as well as to literary-philosophical debates, and trying to present a complete picture of the intellectual concerns and intellectual trends of the age, Anii treizeci is quite narrowly focused on the rise of the extreme right and the reactions this phenomenon raised raised among the thinkers of a different orientation. [...] The general impression one gets, after this comparison, is that Ornea [...] avoided to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> re-comprehend, in post-communist terms, the problems connected with the sociological and economic component of pre-communist doctrines and ideological currents, as well as to discover a new, post-totalitarian 'language', fit for preserving the vagaries of the Romanian left." ...|$|E

5000|$|Responsibility In {{order to}} care, {{we must take}} it upon ourselves, thus responsibility.

Tronto <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> differentiate <b>the</b> terms [...] "responsibility" [...] and [...] "obligation" [...] with regards to the ethic of care. Responsibility is ambiguous, whereas obligation refers to situations where action or reaction is due, such as the case of a legal contract. This ambiguity allows for ebb and flow in and between class structures and gender roles, and to other socially constructed roles that would bind responsibility to those only befitting of those roles.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine student and teacher perceptions of teachers' instructional behaviour in schools for secondary agricultural education. For this purpose, two questionnaires (a teacher version and a student version) were used, consisting of the scales 'teacher-led activation', 'student-led activation', 'clarity', and 'control'. Clarity of instruction as judged by the students, increases when a teacher <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> activate his or her students. Systematic differences exist between the teachers' perceptions and the students' perceptions: on all scales, teachers appear to give themselves higher 'marks' than the students do. It is argued that, through critical reflection on their own teaching, teachers will become aware of the discrepancy between their own and the students' perceptions. This awareness {{is likely to be a}} driving force for the improvement of teachers' instructional behaviour...|$|R
60|$|It {{was clearly}} {{out of the}} {{question}} for him {{to get down to the}} river, even if he had wished to make the descent, and without stopping to make another fire, he plodded along the bank until the afternoon was almost spent. There were a good many fallen trees, as he discovered to his cost, since each one had to be painfully clambered over, but none of them spanned the chasm. Then, as his foot was becoming very sore, he decided to camp where a big cedar lay across a little ravine that rent the bank. It promised to afford him a partial shelter. He had no axe, but he tore off an armful or two of the thinner branches, with the twigs attached to them, to form a bed, and then, crawling down to the river, filled his smoke-blackened can and came back wearily to make a fire. Man needs very little in those solitudes, but there are two things he must have, and those are food to keep the strength in him, and warmth, though there are times when he finds it singularly difficult to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> obtain them.

While yet the nerves in the track of this drop were quivering, raw with sensitiveness, another drop would start from off the side of his chest, and trickle downwards among the little muscles of his side, to drip on to the bed. It was like the running of a spider over his sensitive, moveless body. Why he did not wipe himself he did not know. He lay still and endured this horrible tickling, which seemed to bite deep into him, rather than <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> move, which he loathed to do. The drops ran off his forehead down his temples. Those he did not mind: he was blunt there. But they started again, in tiny, vicious spurts, down the sides of his chest, from under his armpits, down the inner sides of his thighs, till he seemed to have a myriad quivering tracks of a myriad running insects over his hot, wet, highly-sensitized body. His nerves were trembling, one and all, with outrage and vivid suspense. It became unbearable. He felt that, if he endured it another moment, he would cry out, or suffocate and burst.|$|E
