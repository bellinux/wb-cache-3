5|$|The last squeaky {{wheel in}} the City Council had been greased. The last {{independent}} voice {{had joined the}} chorus...Shiller's endorsement of Daley is all the <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> {{when you look at}} where she started, about as close to a Marxist as you'd ever find at City Hall.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this alone}} does not explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. This {{seems to have been a}} particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.|$|E
5|$|KRNKNN and KRBKNN — Friedrich Amelung had {{analyzed}} {{these two}} endgames in the 1900s. KRNKNN and KRBKNN are {{won for the}} strongest side in 78% and 95% of the cases, respectively. Stiller's DTC tablebase revealed several lengthy wins in these endgames. The longest win in KRBKNN has a DTC of 223 and a DTM of 238 moves (not shown). Even <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> is the position at right, where White wins starting with 1. Ke6! Stiller reported the DTC as 243 moves, and the DTM was later found to be 262 moves.|$|E
60|$|I stood aghast, even <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> {{than the}} house itself had been only the instant before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good heavens, Boone! Is it you; {{and what}} is the meaning of this mummery?" [...] I asked, staring at him <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> than ever.|$|R
60|$|At this command Dangler was <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> than ever. But of {{a sudden}} he {{appeared}} to realize something of what had happened and commenced to run.|$|R
25|$|It is even <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> how, for instance, anyone {{managed to}} get the forty-plus members of the camp symphony orchestra, or of the brass band, or of one of the {{dramatic}} societies, not to mention the football or swimming teams, together for practices. Moreover, the various music groups and sporting societies were soon to be found performing in various parts of Northeast England by popular request.|$|E
25|$|It is even <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> however {{that all}} these {{societies}} had but one main aim behind their various activities, apart that is from enjoying themselves, which was {{to raise money for}} wartime charities, to help orphans, war-widows, refugee families, disabled soldiers, prisoners of war; or even to buy new boots for soldiers serving in the trenches. As Fabry puts it:‘Each of the many different societies in Elisabethville has a character all its own, yet a common basis: philanthropy. We need recreation, but of a sort that helps the unfortunate’.The total amount raised probably equates to hundreds of thousands of pounds today, if not millions.|$|E
500|$|... "Reflektor" [...] is a dance-rock, indie rock, and disco song. The track's lyrical content is, in part, {{influenced}} by the differences between Haitian life {{and that of the}} Western world, with vocalist and guitarist Win Butler noting, [...] "I think that life [...] is incredibly difficult and it's <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> to see people that don't have access to food or clean water throw a party. It's not like I'm trying to sing about their experiences. I was more learning from what I saw and applying it to my own life, lyrically. I'm not trying to tell other people's stories. We're just trying to allow an experience to change you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{amazing thing}} is that I'm not <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> at myself. I, the virtuous young matron. Am I to be trusted? If the Prince Charming came---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose we let Eureka {{go down to}} {{the street}} and get some one to help us," [...] {{suggested}} Zeb, who had been even <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> than Dorothy at these strange happenings.|$|R
6000|$|<b>More</b> <b>amazed</b> than ever, {{the young}} man was about to leave her when she said, with a mixture of entreaty and command, [...] "Please stay a moment. I want to speak to you." ...|$|R
500|$|Other fictional inspirations include Columbo and Sherlock Holmes, and his {{obsession}} with neatness and order {{may be an}} homage to Hercule Poirot. Like Holmes, and occasionally Poirot, Monk is accompanied by an earnest assistant {{with little or no}} detective ability, similar to Doctor Watson and Captain Hastings, respectively; Monk's two major allies from the police department, Captain Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Disher (credited as [...] "Deacon" [...] in the pilot episode), are reminiscent of Inspector Lestrade and Chief Inspector Japp, Holmes's and Poirot's well-meaning but ineffectual respective police counterparts. In addition, Monk has a brother whose abilities of deduction are even <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> than his, yet much more geographically limited due to his own personal problems, somewhat in the style of Mycroft Holmes (who is more adept than Sherlock but also notoriously lazy).|$|E
500|$|Bacon did {{not seek}} to {{illustrate}} the narrative of the tale, however. He told the French art critic Michel Leiris, [...] "I could not paint Agamemnon, Clytemnestra or Cassandra, as {{that would have been}} merely another kind of historical painting... Therefore I tried to create an image of the effect it produced inside me." [...] Aeschylus' phrase [...] "the reek of human blood smiles out at me" [...] in particular haunted Bacon, and his treatments of the mouth in the triptych and many subsequent paintings were attempts to visualise the sentiment. In 1985, he observed that Aeschylus' phrase brought up in him [...] "the most exciting images, and I often read it... the violence of it brings up the images in me, 'the reek of human blood smiles out at me', well what could be <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> than that." ...|$|E
500|$|Pizzolatto {{narrowed his}} search for a {{suitable}} director to Cary Joji Fukunaga, whom he knew from Anonymous Content, and Alejandro González Iñárritu. Fukunaga was formally appointed as director after Iñárritu {{pulled out of the}} project due to film commitments. In preparation for his work on the series, Fukunaga spent time with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division to develop an accurate depiction of a 1990s homicide detective's work. Fukunaga recruited Adam Arkapaw, director of photography of Top of the Lake, as project cinematographer. Arkapaw came to the director's attention for his work in Animal Kingdom (2010) and Snowtown (2011), and was hired after the two negotiated a deal at a meeting in San Francisco. Alex DiGerlando, who Fukunaga had worked with on Benh Zeitlin Glory at Sea in 2008, was appointed as the production designer. Fukunaga said in an interview, [...] "I knew what Alex accomplished in the swamps of Louisiana and given some money, how much <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> he could be in building sets that would just be used for one or two days and be abandoned again." ...|$|E
6000|$|If a powder-barrel had {{exploded}} in the Jesuits' faces, {{they could not have}} been <b>more</b> <b>amazed.</b> Campian looked blank at Parsons, and Parsons at Campian; till the stouter-hearted of the two, recovering his breath at last-- ...|$|R
50|$|Boxing fan Sonya Bartow {{and manager}} Pop Richardson are both {{impressed}} {{the first time}} they see amateur Paul Callan win a fight. They are <b>more</b> <b>amazed,</b> and Sonya somewhat appalled, when they discover later that Paul is deaf.|$|R
5000|$|I heard Melisjust {{two summers}} ago at the Nurtingen Festival. I was amazed to see a young duo {{headlining}} an evening concert at that major festival, but <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> to hear them. The ensemble was precise, the musicianship truly compelling.|$|R
500|$|The initial {{location}} for principal photography for True Detective was Arkansas; however, Pizzolatto later opted to film in southern Louisiana {{to capitalize on}} generous statewide tax incentives and the area's distinctive landscape, which he felt illustrated a striking paradox. [...] "There's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all," [...] the native Louisianan noted. [...] "Everything lives under layers of concealment. The woods are thick and dark and impenetrable. On the other hand you have {{the beauty of it}} all from a distance." [...] "The Long Bright Dark" [...] and subsequent episodes were shot in 35 mm film, and principal photography for the season consumed 100 consecutive days. The crew filmed exterior shots at a remote sugarcane field outside of Erath, Louisiana which, because it was partially burned, inspired a [...] "moody and atmospheric" [...] backdrop for corresponding scenes. Fukunaga recruited Adam Arkapaw, previously director of photography for Top of the Lake, as project cinematographer and employed minimalistic lighting for layering composition. Also involved in production was Alex DiGerlando, who Fukunaga had previously worked with on Benh Zeitlin Glory at Sea (2008). The director remarked in an interview, [...] "I knew what Alex accomplished in the swamps of Louisiana and given some money, how much <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> he could be in building sets that would just be used for one or two days and be abandoned again." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "just about perfect", writing: [...] "this {{was one of}} those high-energy episodes that narrowed its song focus [...] and found a just-right mix of cynicism and optimism, of banal reality and glam performance." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal commented: [...] "It's been a long premiere season of ups and downs, and this last show is a warm embrace that — let’s face it — you just don't want to let go." [...] The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson deemed the episode [...] "awesome", observing: [...] "While it was light on the usual humor, it was heavy on emotion, and I think that's ideal for a season finale. Glee ended its freshman season with a real wallop that took a couple of unexpected turns before pulling nicely into a satisfying finish." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded the episode [...] "A-", deeming it among the best of the entire season. He felt that: [...] "On its own, 'Journey to Regionals' is a fantastic episode of Glee. As a capper to the season, it mostly works." [...] While VanDerWerff had some issues with the episode, including Shelby's sudden decision to adopt Beth, he summarized that: [...] "for once in this back nine, the good stuff absolutely overwhelms the stupid stuff." [...] Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News felt that: [...] "Glee wrapped up on a high note, leaving some of the season's less-appealing plotlines behind and heading towards the promise of more performances and <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> Sue Sylvester one-liners next season." ...|$|E
2500|$|So {{effective}} {{was this}} buffer that 109 men escaped the prison without ever being stopped. [...] At one point, Colonel Rose walked {{straight into the}} path of an oncoming sentinel. [...] Unflinching, he [...] "strode boldly past the guard unchallenged." [...] Even <b>more</b> <b>amazing,</b> once news of the escape way broke out among the prisoners a panicked rush resulted, creating a thunderous stampede for the tunnel. [...] Wholly unsuspecting of the reality of the situation, one Confederate guard yelled out to a fellow sentry, [...] "Halloa, Bill—there’s somebody’s coffeepot upset, sure!" ...|$|E
60|$|Seeing them {{together}} I was <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> than ever {{at the fact}} of their extraordinary affection for each other, their perfect amity which had lasted so many years without a rift, which nothing could break, as people said, except a woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope he may {{speak more}} plainly in another way," [...] said Mrs. Cliff. [...] "And now {{let us go}} up and get our things together. I am a good deal <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> by the letter than I was by the ship." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus arrayed {{and armed}} she set forth, and Caleb seeing her {{approach}} {{at a distance}} was amazed at her grotesque appearance, and even <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> still when she explained who and what she was {{and asked him to}} direct her to the field of swedes.|$|R
2500|$|... "I have {{maintained}} {{for the duration}} of my time in Smackin' Isaiah/A Wilhelm Scream that when it stopped being fun, I would give it up. The bottom line here is that I just don't enjoy the day-in, day-out grind of being on tour anymore.... There are no personal or creative differences between any of us. None of that bullshit. I still love this band and everything it stands for. The six years that I've spent in SI/AWS have been the best of my life. We've accomplished more than I ever expected, and I take with me with <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> memories than most people experience in a lifetime.|$|E
2500|$|The line did however assist German {{construction}} in Jerusalem in the 1890s, {{allowing them to}} bring more construction materials more quickly. By {{the start of the}} 20th century, the German Colony became an attractive spot for those seeking superior transportation. In addition, it improved public health in Jerusalem considerably, and allowed further expansion, as it allowed the import of large quantities of fresh water into the city from other aquifers. Paul Cotterell wrote that [...] "The coming of the railway {{had a profound effect on}} Jerusalem. In the first decade of the line's existence the population of the city almost doubled, which is all the <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> when considering that Jerusalem at this period produced hardly enough wine, vegetables or cattle for its own needs." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was likely}} {{never to be}} {{anything}} <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> than a mother and wife, who would entertain the Honiton Embroidery Circle twice a year.|$|E
60|$|First let me {{tell you}} that all the magicians and spirits in your employ have {{fulfilled}} the instructions of their wondrous mistress to admiration. Flowers have fallen in my path wherever I have trod; and when they rained upon me at Cork I was <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> than you ever saw me.|$|R
6000|$|The bishop was <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> than ever. Had he {{seen his}} father? [...] "No," [...] he replied; {{he had not}} yet had the pleasure: he hoped he might; and, as he said so, he {{resolved}} to bear heavy on that fat, immovable rector, if ever he had the power of doing so.|$|R
60|$|So {{little of}} what was womanly was left in her appearance, that now, when she burst into tears, he stood amazed. But he was <b>more</b> <b>amazed,</b> and much disquieted, to note that in her awakened {{recollection}} of this wrong, the first trace of her old humanity and frozen tenderness appeared to show itself.|$|R
6000|$|He didn't argue it. He {{smiled and}} said [...] "Tut!" [...] and placidly catalogued her with, [...] "You're the pluckiest girl I've ever seen, and it's all the <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> because you're not a motion-picture Tomboy, but {{essentially}} exquisite----" ...|$|E
60|$|Altogether, I don't know {{anything}} <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> than these persistent strides and throbbings so far through our Nineteenth century of perhaps its biggest, sharpest, and most erudite brain, in defiance and discontent with everything; contemptuously ignoring, (either from constitutional inaptitude, ignorance itself, {{or more likely}} because he demanded a definite cure-all here and now,) the only solace and solvent to be had.|$|E
60|$|THE ARCHBISHOP [making a wry face] Is {{that the}} reality? How these things grow in our imagination! But may I say, Mrs Lutestring, that the transfiguration of a parlor maid to an angel is not <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> than her transfiguration {{to the very}} dignified and able Domestic Minister I am addressing. I {{recognize}} the angel in you. Frankly, I do not recognize the parlor maid.|$|E
60|$|The captain looked, if possible, <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> {{than his}} sister {{for a second}} or two, then his red face relaxed into a broad grin, and he sat down on a chair and chuckled, wiping the {{perspiration}} (he seemed always more or less in a state of perspiration) from his bald head the while.|$|R
6000|$|She was the <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> and startled when, one Sunday {{evening in}} spring, Mr. Hargrave {{came to her}} as she sat in her own parlour, saying, [...] "Madam, you will be amazed, but under the circumstances, the parson and myself being both here, Mr. Belamour trusts you will not object to the {{immediate}} performance of the ceremony." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{returned}} to the castle {{as quickly as he}} could, and told the Fairy that her commands were obeyed. She was even <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> than she had been before, and asked him again if he had either seen or spoken to the black girl; but the Prince knew better than to betray his word, and once more lied freely.|$|R
