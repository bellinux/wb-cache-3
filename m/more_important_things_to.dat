This was built in 193839 {{on the site of}} a former sanitation depot, also designed by Ludwig Hoffmann and already decorated with more than 50 plaques by Otto Lessing depicting bears, and a public lavatory, and opened on 17 August 1939. It consists of indoor sleeping quarters and outdoor exercise areas which have held as many as five bears (the armorial animal of Berlin) who are the official bears or mascots of the city. The impetus for building the Bärenzwinger was a letter to the newspaper Berliner Zeitung am Mittag (now B.Z.) from Wilfried Bade which appeared the day {{after the end of the}} celebration of the city's 700-year anniversary, and the Lord Mayor, Julius Lippert, had it completed despite objections from some Nazi functionaries that there were <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> be done in what proved to be the run-up to World War II. Two of the original bears were gifts from Bern, which also has a bear on its arms. It remains largely unchanged, although it had to be reconstructed after the war; it reopened in 1949 with two new bears, again from Bern; one of these, Jente, produced 33 cubs (including 4 sets of triplets and 9 pairs of twins) before being retired to the zoo. The last official city bear, Schnute, lived there until her death in 2015; her daughter Maxi also lived there until her death in August 2013. The Bärenzwinger is a listed Berlin landmark. It was threatened with closure in 1990 due to lack of funds for needed modernisation, but after public protest, the Berlin Senate undertook to pay for the project. Underfloor heating in the cages and a skylight dome were added, and the electricity supply was overhauled. The facility reopened in 1993 and celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2009. Some animal protection advocates, including the city's own animal protection officer, have called for it to be closed as oldfashioned and inhumane.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cloud {{computing}} platforms offer {{a convenient}} solution for addressing challenges of processing large-scale data in both academia and industry, beyond {{what could be}} achieved with traditional on-site clusters. There are {{a great number of}} on-line cloud services, and in the meantime, the security issue is getting more and more significant for cloud users. Whereas Hadoop-based cloud platform is currently a well-known service framework, our goal in this paper is to investigate the mechanisms of authentication and encryption of Hadoop. We try to construct a highly secure Hadoop platform with small deployment cost, robust attacking prevention, and less performance degradation. We also conduct a number of simulations to evaluate the performance under different parametric settings and cryptographic algorithms. Simulation results reveal the feasibility of security mechanisms, and find that the <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> construct cloud platforms with appropriate security mechanisms is to consider the application requirements, which could be a better trade-off between security and user requirement...|$|R

The CRE called on bookshops to remove the comic, stating that it contained [...] "hideous racial prejudice" [...] by depicting Congolese who [...] "look like monkeys and talk like imbeciles." [...] Responding that it was committed to letting its [...] "customers make the choice", Borders moved the book to an area reserved for adult graphic novels. UK bookseller Waterstone's followed suit. [...] Another British retailer, WHSmith, said that the book was sold on its website, but with a label that recommended it for readers aged 16 and over. The CRE's attempt to ban the book was criticised by Conservative Party politician Ann Widdecombe, who remarked that the organisation had <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do than regulate the availability of historical children's books. The media controversy increased interest in the book, and Borders reported that its sales of Tintin in the Congo had been boosted 4,000%, while it also rose to eighth on the Amazon.com bestseller list.

2500|$|Small {{traces of}} {{plutonium}} {{have been found}} in the soil near the stricken reactors: repeated examinations of the soil suggest that the plutonium level is similar to the background level caused by atomic bomb tests. As the isotope signature of the plutonium is closer to that of power-reactor plutonium, TEPCO suggested that [...] "two samples out of five may be the direct result of the recent incident." [...] The <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> look at is the curium level in the soil; the soil does contain a short-lived isotope (curium-242) which shows that some alpha emitters have been released in small amounts by the accident. The release of the beta/gamma emitters such as caesium-137 has been far greater. In the short and medium term the effects of the iodine and the caesium release will dominate the effect of the accident on farming and the general public. In common with almost all soils, the soil at the reactor site contains uranium, but the concentration of uranium and the isotope signature suggests that the uranium is the normal, natural uranium in the soil.|$|R

40|$|With the {{issuance}} of Corporate Governance Code in 2000 in Malaysia, {{it is expected that}} corporate governance has played an important role ensuring the reliability of financial statements. This study seeks to examine the nature financial restatements in Malaysia. It also seeks to investigate whether the corporate governance characteristics are associated with financial restatement. Using the restated financial statements during the period of 2002 to 2005 matched with a control group of non-restating firms, the results show that the primary reason for misstating the accounts is to inflate earnings. The nomination committee of the firms that restated is less independent and managerial ownership and the logistic regression analysis indicates that the extent of ownership by outside blockholders is able to constrain managers from misstating accounts. The results also show that firms with high level of debts (an indicator of the presence of debt covenants) are more likely to commit in financial misstatement. The research is significant as it provides evidence on the role of corporate governance, especially the ownership by outside blockholders in Malaysia. This shows that outside blockholders is effective in disciplining managers so that the accounts so prepared are not misleading. This study does not support the move by Malaysian Government to require companies audit committee to be wholly independent. It is suggested that the <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> is <b>to</b> have audit committee members who understand accounting and the related standards...|$|R

40|$|In this Masters Thesis the Overall Equipment Effectiveness, OEE, and Value Stream Mapping, VSM, {{were used}} for {{measuring}} and making production more efficient as part of Lean Manufacturing. The work {{has been carried out}} during {{the spring and summer of}} 2004 at some of the foundries of INTERMET Corp in the USA. The INTERMET foundries use OEE and VSM tools to report their results to the company headquarter and to follow up and continuously improve their effectiveness. The fact that OEE is used to compare the different factories might lead to it not being utilized as well as possible. The OEE number is basically a very good measure of the effectiveness of the machines, but should primarily be used for internal supervision of trends. If it is used to compare different factories, the temptation to adapt the values to the expectations might reduce its contribution to the real work of making production more efficient. VSM is a simple and efficient method used to focus on the path a product takes through the value adding chain and to generate good ideas for how to develop, simplify and make this <b>more</b> efficient. The <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> think about when starting VSM work is to be prepared to implement any improvements quickly, otherwise the results soon will be forgotten and VSM will lose its status as a good and efficient tool. INTERMET should continue their OEE measure for the plants for continuous improvement of the machines and not as a measure for comparing plants. This will be misleading as different plants have different machines. INTERMET should also continue to do VSM mappings on a regular basis to see if the plants actually do change their processes in a lean manufacturing way. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

Our country wrongs itself by permitting such a system of unsuitable appointments, and, still more, of removals for no cause, just when the incumbent might be beginning to ripen into usefulness.
