40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of electricity markets under <b>marginal</b> and pay-as-bid <b>pricing.</b> <b>Marginal</b> <b>pricing</b> {{is believed to}} yield the maximum social welfare and is currently implemented by most electricity markets. However, in view of recent electricity market failures, pay-as-bid has been extensively discussed as a possible alternative to <b>marginal</b> <b>pricing.</b> In this research, <b>marginal</b> and pay-as-bid <b>pricing</b> have been analyzed in electricity markets with both perfect and imperfect competition. The perfect competition case is studied under both exact and uncertain system marginal cost prediction. The comparison of the two pricing methods is conducted through two steps: (i) identify the best offer strategy of the generating companies (gencos); (ii) analyze the market performance under these optimum genco strategies. The analysis results together with numerical simulations show that pay-as-bid and <b>marginal</b> <b>pricing</b> are equivalent in a perfect market with exact system marginal cost prediction. In perfect markets with uncertain demand prediction, the two pricing methods are also equivalent but in an expected value sense. If we compare {{from the perspective of}} second order statistics, all market performance measures exhibit much lower values under pay-as-bid than under <b>marginal</b> <b>pricing.</b> The risk of deviating from the mean is therefore much higher under <b>marginal</b> <b>pricing</b> than under pay-as-bid. In an imperfect competition market with exact demand prediction, the research shows that pay-as-bid pricing yields lower consumer payments and lower genco profits. This research provides quantitative evidence that challenges some common claims about pay-as-bid pricing. One is that under pay-as-bid, participants would soon learn how to offer so as to obtain the same or higher profits than what they would have obtained under <b>marginal</b> <b>pricing.</b> This research however shows that, under pay-as-bid, participants can at best earn the same profit or expected profit as under <b>marginal</b> <b>pricing.</b> A second common claim refuted by this research is that pay-as-bid does not provide correct price signals if there is a scarcity of generation resources. We show that pay-as-bid does provide a price signal with such characteristics and furthermore argue that the <b>price</b> signal under <b>marginal</b> <b>pricing</b> with gaming may not necessarily be correct since it would then not reflect a lack of generation capacity but a desire to increase profit...|$|R

50|$|Pricing: <b>Marginal</b> <b>price</b> {{in a water}} market {{should reflect}} parity between the {{marginal}} willingness to pay of all consumers in the market (i.e. the marginal social demand) and the marginal social cost of provision (that accounts for private costs, externalities to third parties, storage and conveyance costs, and resource scarcity). However, in practice, water is often administratively priced by management institutions, who are reluctant to raise prices to reflect water scarcity, so water is under-priced and over-consumed. Because administrative prices are not determined by market conditions, they do not automatically respond to changes in long-term or short-term supply, and can be set {{at a variety of}} levels (such as short-run marginal cost or long-run marginal cost, with varying assumptions about fixed or variable demand and costs) that are not Pareto efficient. One challenge in quantifying an accurate social <b>marginal</b> <b>price</b> involves difficulty in measuring the price elasticity of water. Determining price elasticity for the agricultural or industrial sector can be difficult because water use might not be metered or water is free. The marginal value of instream demand requires nonmarket valuation techniques such as recreational demand models, contingent valuation or hedonic housing models. Yet as the diversion of water offstream increases, the marginal value of water left instream will increase and nonmarket valuation techniques will only reflect a static price. Municipal water demand elasticity is also difficult to measure because historically municipal water is under-priced and set at the long-run marginal cost of supply.|$|E

This paper provides a method to minimize the locational <b>marginal</b> <b>pricing</b> in the energy market. This market works under locational <b>marginal</b> <b>pricing,</b> i. e., generating units and demand loads are paid and pay, respectively, the locational <b>marginal</b> <b>prices</b> corresponding to the nodes they are connected to. An independent system operator clears the market maximizing the social welfare. As the LMP is also dependent on congestion pricing, here we have reduced the congestion in a particular line by the method of rescheduling of generators. Not all the generators are participating in the congestion initially identified the participating generators based on their sensitivity factors. By the method of rescheduling the generation of the generators congestion can be easily reduced so that congestion cost is reduced. Finally, LMP can be minimized in the deregulated power market. The proposed method is implemented tested on 6 -Bus System, IEEE 14 -Bus System, IEEE 26 -Bus system and IEEE 30 -Bus system. It is observed the good result in minimizing the LMP...|$|R

This auction is {{an instance of}} price-based market clearing wherein market-clearing prices are explicitly modeled as decision variables of the optimization. The auction design includes network constraints, inter-temporal constraints associated with generation scheduling, and <b>marginal</b> <b>pricing.</b> Hence, consumer payment is {{expressed in terms of}} locational <b>marginal</b> <b>prices.</b> The proposed solution approach is based on bilevel programming. In the upper-level optimization, genera-tion is scheduled with the goal of minimizing the total con-sumer payment while taking into account that locational mar-ginal prices are determined by a multiperiod optimal power flow in the lower level. In this bilevel programming setting, lo-cational <b>marginal</b> <b>prices</b> are the Lagrange multipliers or dual variables associated with the nodal power balance equations of the lower-level problem. The resulting mixed-integer linear bilevel program is transformed into an equivalent single-level mixed-integer linear program suitable for efficient off-the-shelf software. This transformation relies on the application of results from duality theory of linear programming and integer algebra. The proposed methodology has been successfully applied to sev-eral test systems including the IEEE 118 -bus system.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{straightforward}} to evaluate how a perfectly-optimizing, perfectly-informed customer {{will respond to}} a non-linear price schedule, but such a customer is rare. In the common case of increasing-block pricing of water and electricity, consumers {{do not know what}} <b>marginal</b> <b>price</b> they face during a billing period, because they do not know what demand shocks will occur during the period. If consumers instead set optimal behavioral rules based on the distribution of possible marginal prices they will face (e. g., turn off lights in unused rooms, set the A/C to 74 degrees, replace incandescent lights with CFLs), their consumption will not exhibit discrete responses to the discrete jumps in the price schedule. Using data from a large electricity utility, I show that the empirical distribution of con-sumption quantities is not consistent with consumers accurately knowing and responding to the <b>marginal</b> <b>price</b> they will face. I then estimate the price elasticity of demand us-ing a panel of household observations at two-year intervals, identifying elasticity from the changes in the increasing-block price schedule. The results suggest that most consumers are probably responding to the expected <b>marginal</b> <b>price</b> or even less precise information about what <b>marginal</b> <b>price</b> they will face.

40|$|The {{number of}} power {{electronic}} and distorting loads, {{continue to grow}} at a rapid pace. Accompanying this growth in distortion sources is an increased sensitivity of certain types of loads to harmonic distortion, and poor power quality in general. The result is greater variance in the value loads place on a harmonic free supply, and therefore what {{they are prepared to}} pay to mitigate the potential consequences of harmonic distortion. Harmonic distortion imposes costs worth considering, if not, no action would be taken by networks to mitigate the effects of harmonic injections. This thesis develops tools that allow the valuation of the harmonic injections made by loads throughout a network. The ability to accurately value harmonic distortion is critical if an optimal allocation of resources committed to the problem is to be achieved. Also this work develops methods by which an optimal allocation of resources can be brought about, and ways the costs of any action taken, can be distributed in a manner deemed fair. <b>Marginal</b> <b>pricing</b> is the technique used to achieve an efficient allocation of resources. In a decentralised framework, <b>marginal</b> <b>pricing</b> will encourage efficient behaviour from each network participant.
