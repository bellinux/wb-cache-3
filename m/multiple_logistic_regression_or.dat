40|$|Classical {{statistical}} {{approaches for}} multiclass probability estimation are typically based on regression {{techniques such as}} <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression,</b> <b>or</b> density estimation approaches such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). These methods often make certain assumptions on the form of probability functions or on the underlying distributions of subclasses. In this paper, we develop a model-free procedure to estimate multiclass probabilities based on large-margin classifiers. In particular, the new estimation scheme is employed by solving a series of weighted large-margin classifiers and then systematically extracting the probability information from these multiple classification rules. A main advantage of the proposed probability estimation technique {{is that it does}} not impose any strong parametric assumption on the underlying distribution and can be applied for a wide range of large-margin classification methods. A general computational algorithm is developed for class probability estimation. Furthermore, we establish asymptotic consistency of the probability estimates. Both simulated and real data examples are presented to illustrate competitive performance of the new approach and compare it with several other existing methods...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{assess the}} {{consumption}} of ultra-processed food and sugar-sweetened beverages and to identify the association of this consumption with overweight among vegetarians. Methods: A cross-sectional study with a convenience sampling method was conducted. Data were collected using an online questionnaire from 8 / 24 / 2015 to 10 / 8 / 2015. Subjects were male and female vegetarians aged > 16 years. Using a food frequency questionnaire, we assessed the weekly consumption of ultra-processed food and sugar-sweetened beverages and described the frequency of daily consumption overall and according to type of vegetarianism. The association between overweight and excessive daily intake of ultra-processed food was analyzed by <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> (<b>OR</b> [95 CI%]). Results: Information was retrieved from 503 individuals (29. 8 ± 8. 5 years old); 83. 7 % were women. The most frequent types of vegetarianism in our sample were ovo-lacto (45. 5 %) and vegan (41. 7 %), and the median time of vegetarianism was 5. 3 years. The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (≥ 2 x/day) and ultra-processed food (≥ 3 x/day) was 21. 0 % and 16. 0 %, respectively, and regarding the different vegetarianism types, vegans showed the lowest frequency of excessive daily sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed food consumption. In the multivariable analysis, consumption of ultra-processed food ≥ 3 x/day (2. 33 [1. 36 - 4. 03]), male sex (1. 73 [1. 01 - 2. 96]), age ≥ 35 years (2. 03 [1. 23 - 3. 36]) and not preparing one’s food (1. 67 [0. 95 - 2. 94]) were independently associated with overweight. Conclusion: Although vegetarianism is frequently associated with a healthier diet and, consequently, prevention of poor health outcomes, this {{study found that the}} excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed food was associated with overweight...|$|E

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether baseline pretreatment time to detection (TTD) of culture predicted 2 -month bacteriological conversion and TB relapse. METHODS: A total of 263 non-HIV-infected smearpositive previously untreated pulmonary TB patients were prospectively followed from diagnosis until treatment outcome after 6 months' treatment and TB recurrence within 24 months. RESULTS: The median TTD was 3 days (range 1 - 17). Of 211 (80. 2 %) patients with favourable treatment outcome, 22 (10. 4 %) had recurrence, while 12 (5. 7 %) had confi rmed relapse. Culture conversion at 2 months was associated in univariate analysis with the presence and number of cavities, extensive parenchymal involvement, male sex, sputum smear grading and TTD. In <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression,</b> TTD <b>or</b> smear grading and extensive parenchymal involvement both predicted month 2 conversion. Relapse was predicted by TTD, sex, body mass index, smear grading and number of cavities in univariate analysis, and in multivariate regression by TTD and sputum smear grading.

OBJECTIVE: To explore {{the relationship between}} healthcare system and prevalence of nonadherence with immunosuppressive regimen by studying variation in nonadherence between European and US kidney transplant recipients and as well as nonadherence in European countries. METHODS: We performed a secondary data analysis on data collected in 3 independent cross-sectional studies using comparable methodology including patients from the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland. Nonadherence was measured using 1 item of the Siegal questionnaire. Patients were categorized as nonadherent if they reported missing a dose of immunosuppression in the last 4 weeks. Analyses were performed by <b>multiple</b> mixed <b>logistic</b> <b>regression,</b> with center as a random effect and clinical and demographical differences between groups as fixed effects. RESULTS: 1563 U. S. and 614 European patients from 3 different countries (Belgium [n= 187], the Netherlands [n= 85], and Switzerland [n= 342]) were included. Prevalence of nonadherence in the United States and Europe was 19. 3 % and 13. 2. %, respectively. This higher nonadherence in US patients was confirmed in a <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analysis (<b>OR</b> = 1. 78; 95 % CI, 1. 10 - 2. 89).

40|$|Adherence is {{the result}} of the {{interaction}} of the macro, meso, micro, and patient level factors. The macro level includes full coverage of immunosuppressive medications as is the case in Brazil. We studied the correlates of immunosuppressive non-adherence in post kidney transplant patients in the Brazilian health care system. Using a cross-sectional design, adherence to immunosuppressives was assessed in a sample of 100 kidney transplant patients using a composite non-adherence score consisting of three methods (self-report [i. e., The Basel Adherence Scale for Assessment of Immunossupressives-BAASIS], collateral report, and immunosuppressive blood levels). Multilevel correlations of non-adherence were assessed (macro, meso, micro and patient level). Univariate and multivariate <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> was applied to assess the correlates of non-adherence. Our sample consisted primarily of male (65 %), Caucasians (72 %) with a mean age of 45. 0 ± 13. 5 years old, who received grafts from a living donor (89 %), with a mean time after transplantation of 72. 3 ± 44. 4 months. Prevalence of non-adherence was 51 %. Family income higher than five reference wages (21. 6 vs. 4 %; OR 6. 46 [1. 35 - 30. 89], p = 0. 009; patient level), and having access to private health insurance (35. 3 % vs. 18. 4 %; OR 2. 42 [0. 96 - 6. 10], p = 0. 04; meso level) were associated with non-adherence in univariate analysis.

Methods: Two hundred (200) postpartum women age 20 or greater who had delivered a healthy full-term baby (37 weeks gestation) participated in the study. Data were gathered by means of a semi-structured questionnaire in the Spanish language. Descriptive and inferen-tial statistics (Chi-square) were used for data analysis. Results: Thirty percent (30 %) of participants were 21 to 26 years of age. Primiparas com-prised 51 % and legally or consensually married mothers comprised 89 % of the study partic-ipants. Monthly family incomes with the highest frequencies were $ 0 to $ 2000 and $ 2001 to $ 3000, respectively. Full breastfeeding was being practiced by 43. 5 % of the mothers in the study, whereas 53. 0 % were breastfeeding partially. Compliance with the Ten Steps was per-ceived as deficient by 52 % of the mothers, whereas only 5. 5 % perceived compliance as ex-cellent. The perceived level of compliance with the Ten Steps is significantly associated with the type of breastfeeding (full or partial) in the inferential analyses (X 2 [3, n 193] 33. 74, p 0. 00) and in the <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analyses (<b>OR</b> 1. 27, confidence interval [CI] 1. 14 – 1. 43, p 0. 00).

40|$|Background: Diet {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{as having a}} role in the aetiology of oral and pharyngeal cancer, and dietary factors may account for 10 - 15 % of cases in Europe. Folate deficiency has been linked to risk of several cancers, but has not been studied adequately with respect to oral cancer. Patients and methods: This case-control study, conducted in Italy and French-speaking Switzerland, included 749 patients with incident cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, and 1772 hospital controls with acute, non-neoplastic conditions. The interviews used a validated food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression.</b> Results: The <b>ORs</b> were 0. 68 (95 % CI 0. 52 - 0. 88) for the intermediate tertile and 0. 53 (95 % CI 0. 40 - 0. 69) for the highest tertile of dietary folate intake, compared with the lowest tertile. No heterogeneity was found in strata of gender, age, methionine intake or alcohol consumption. The combined OR for low-folate and high-alcohol intake versus high-folate and low-alcohol intake was 22. 3 (95 % CI 13. 1 - 38). Conclusions: Our study supports a protective role of folate against oral and pharyngeal carcinogenesis. Compared with low folate intake, a consistent reduction in risk was already observed from intermediate levels of intake, suggesting that cancer risk may be related to relative folate deficienc...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the nutritional {{status of a}} cohort of children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) and to assess the effect of malnutrition as an independent risk factor affecting outcome in this patient group. Methods: in a prospective cohort study, 385 children admitted to the ICU of a teaching hospital over a 2 -y period were assessed for nutritional status at admission and clinical outcome. the outcome variables were 30 -d mortality, length of ICU stay, and length of mechanical ventilation. Potential exposure variables were gender, age, diagnosis (clinical versus surgical), septic shock, malnutrition, and scores on the Pediatric Index of Mortality and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction. Nutritional status was determined using z scores of weight for age, height for age, and body mass index, based on the World Health Organization child growth standards. Patients with z score < - 2 of anthropometric indexes were considered malnourished. Results: 175 patients (45. 5 %) were malnourished on admission. Sixteen patients of the malnourished group (9. 14 %) and 25 patients (11. 9 %) of the non-malnourished group died. Malnutrition was associated with greater length of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay, but not with mortality on univariate analysis. Malnutrition was associated with greater length of ventilation on the <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> model (<b>OR</b> 1. 76, 95 %; CI 1. 08 - 2. 88; P = 0. 024). Conclusion: Malnutrition is common among children admitted to an ICU. This factor was not a predictor of mortality but showed independent association with length of mechanical ventilation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the prevalence, mutual associations, clinical manifestations, and diagnoses associated with serum autoantibodies, as detected using recently available immunoassays, in patients with autoimmune myositis (AIM). Sera and clinical data were collected from 100 patients with AIM followed longitudinally. Sera were screened cross-sectionally for 21 autoantibodies by multiplex addressable laser bead immunoassay, line blot immunoassay, immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated recombinant protein, protein A assisted immunoprecipitation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Diagnoses were determined using the Bohan and Peter classification as well as recently proposed classifications. Relationships between autoantibodies and clinical manifestations were analyzed by <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression.</b> One <b>or</b> more autoantibodies encompassing 19 specificities were present in 80 % of the patients. The most common autoantibodies were anti-Ro 52 (30 % of patients), anti-Ku (23 %), anti-synthetases (22 %), anti-U 1 RNP (15 %), and anti-fibrillarin (14 %). In the presence of autoantibodies to Ku, synthetases, U 1 RNP, fibrillarin, PM-Scl, or scleroderma autoantigens, at least one more autoantibody was detected in the majority of sera and at least two more autoantibodies in over one-third of sera. The largest number of concurrent autoantibodies was six autoantibodies. Overall, 44 distinct combinations of autoantibodies were counted. Most autoantibodies were unrestricted to any AIM diagnostic category. Distinct clinical syndromes and therapeutic responses were associated with anti-Jo- 1, anti-fibrillarin, anti-U 1 RNP, anti-Ro, anti-Ro 52, and autoantibodies to scleroderma autoantigens. We conclude that a significant proportion of AIM patients are characterized by complex associations of autoantibodies. Certain myositis autoantibodies are markers for distinct overlap syndromes and predict therapeutic outcomes. The ultimate clinical features, disease course, and response to therapy in a given AIM patient may be linked to the particular set of associated autoantibodies. These results provide a rationale for patient profiling and its application to therapeutics, because it cannot be assumed that the B-cell response is the same even in the majority of patients in a given diagnostic category...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Data on the {{association}} between vitamin D and upper digestive tract neoplasms are limited. METHODS: In two case-control studies in Italy, we examined the relation between dietary vitamin D intake and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (SCCE; 304 cases) and oral/pharyngeal cancer (804 cases). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression.</b> RESULTS: Adjusted <b>ORs</b> for SCCE and oral/pharyngeal cancer were 0. 58 (95 % CI 0. 39 - 0. 86) and 0. 76 (95 % CI 0. 60 - 0. 94), respectively, for the highest tertile of vitamin D intake. Using a reference group {{of those in the}} highest tertile of vitamin D who were never/former smokers, ORs were 8. 7 (95 % CI 4. 1 - 18. 7) for SCCE and 10. 4 (95 % CI 6. 9 - 15. 5) for oral/pharyngeal cancer among heavy smokers in the lowest vitamin D tertile; similarly, compared with those in the highest tertile of vitamin D who drank < 3 alcoholic drinks/day, corresponding ORs were 41. 9 (95 % CI 13. 7 - 128. 6) for SCCE and 8. 5 (95 % CI 5. 7 - 12. 5) for oral/pharyngeal cancer, among heavy alcohol drinkers in the lowest vitamin D tertile. CONCLUSION: We observed inverse associations between dietary vitamin D intake and risk of SCCE and, perhaps, oral/pharyngeal cancer, which were most pronounced among heavy current smokers and heavy consumers of alcohol...|$|R

Objective. This study aimed to evaluate the association between serum uric acid (SUA) levels within a normal to high range {{and the risk of}} metabolic syndrome (MetS) among community elderly and explore the sex difference. Design and Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a representative urban area of Beijing between 2009 and 2010. A two-stage stratified clustering sampling method was used and 2102 elderly participants were included. Results. The prevalence of hyperuricemia and MetS was 16. 7 % and 59. 1 %, respectively. There was a strong association between hyperuricemia and four components of MetS in women and three components in men. <b>Multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analysis showed <b>ORs</b> of hyperuricemia for MetS were 1. 67 (95 % CI: 1. 11 – 2. 50) in men and 2. 73 (95 % CI: 1. 81 – 4. 11) in women. Even in the normal range, the ORs for MetS increased gradually according to SUA levels. MetS component number also showed an increasing trend across SUA quartile in both sexes (P for trend< 0. 01). Conclusion. This study suggests that higher SUA levels, even in the normal range, are positively associatedwithMetS amongChinese community elderly, and the association is stronger inwomen thanmen.

40|$|Adiponectin, an adipocyte-specific {{secretory}} protein {{known to}} induce apoptosis, {{has been reported}} to be inversely related to breast and endometrial cancers and recently found to inhibit proliferation of myeloid but not lymphoid cell lines. We hypothesised that adiponectin may be inversely associated with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), but not with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia of B (ALL-B) or T (ALL-T) cell origin in children. Blood samples and clinical information were collected over the period 1996 – 2000 from 201 children (0 – 14 years old) with leukaemia (22 AML, 161 ALL-B and 18 ALL-T cases) through a national network of childhood Hematology-Oncology units in Greece and from 201 controls hospitalised for minor pediatric ailments. Serum adiponectin levels were measured under code, at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA using a radioimmunoassay procedure. Each of the three leukaemia groups was compared with the control group through <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression.</b> Odds ratios (<b>OR)</b> and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) for an increase of adiponectin equal to 1 s. d. among controls were estimated controlling for gender, age, as well as for height and weight, expressed in age–gender-specific centiles of Greek growth curves. Adiponectin was inversely associated with AML (OR 0. 56; 95 % CI, 0. 34 – 0. 94), whereas it was not significantly associated with either ALL-B (OR 0. 88; 95 % CI, 0. 71 – 1. 10) or ALL-T (OR 1. 08; 95 % CI, 0. 67 – 1. 72).

40|$|The {{medically}} important spiders Loxosceles intermedia Mello-Leitao and Loxosceles laeta (Nicolet) are segregated in Curitiba, southern Brazil, where L. intermedia is more abundant and widespread than L. laeta. Because they share similar microhabitat preferences and wander {{in search of}} web sites, agonistic encounters are likely to occur. The {{purposes of this study}} were to describe agonistic interactions and interpret their consequences for the relative abundances and spatial segregation of L. intermedia and L. laeta. Experimental contests were performed between residents and intruders. Asymmetries between contestants included sex, age, species, weight, and residence status. Nine behavioral categories were defined. Through discriminant analyses, it was possible to differentiate spider sex, species, and residence based on their agonistic behaviors. Intruders, juveniles, and L. intermedia individuals were better characterized by exploratory behaviors, whereas L. laeta females were differentiated by aggressiveness. By performing a <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression,</b> with winning <b>or</b> defeat as a dependent variable of sex, age, species, size, weight, and residence, it was possible to say that residents and L. intermedia individuals had the highest winning odds in contests, where as juveniles had lower winning odds than adults. Advantages of the prior residence may help to explain the predominance of L. laeta in old colonization sites, whereas the higher winning odds of L. intermedia and less aggressive behavior toward conspecifies may lead to a successful establishment of dense populations in new sites. A better understanding of agonistic interactions as a mechanism of spacing, segregation, and species replacement among spiders may be helpful for control purposes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Infectious {{disease is}} often the reason for {{intravenous}} drug users being seen in a clinical setting. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the appropriateness of treatment and outcomes for this patient population in a hospital setting. Methods Retrospective study of all intravenous drug users hospitalized for treatment of infectious diseases and seen by infectious diseases specialists 1 / 2001 – 12 / 2006 at a university hospital. Treatment was administered according to guidelines when possible or to alternative treatment program in case of patients for whom adherence to standard protocols was not possible. Outcomes were defined with respect to appropriateness of treatment, hospital readmission, relapse and mortality rates. For statistical analysis adjustment for multiple hospitalizations of individual patients was made by using a generalized estimating equation. Results The total number of hospitalizations for infectious diseases was 344 among 216 intravenous drug users. Skin and soft tissue infections (n = 129, 37. 5 % of hospitalizations), pneumonia (n = 75, 21. 8 %) and endocarditis (n = 54, 15. 7 %) were most prevalent. Multiple infections were present in 25 %. Treatment was according to standard guidelines for 78. 5 %, according to an alternative recommended program for 11. 3 %, and not according to guidelines or by the infectious diseases specialist advice for 10. 2 % of hospitalizations. Psychiatric disorders had a significant negative impact on compliance (compliance problems in 19. 8 % of hospitalizations) in <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analysis (<b>OR</b> = 2. 4, CI 1. 1 – 5. 1, p = 0. 03). The overall readmission rate and relapse rate within 30 days was 13. 7 % and 3. 8 %, respectively. Both non-compliant patient behavior (OR = 3. 7, CI 1. 3 – 10. 8, p = 0. 02) and non-adherence to treatment guidelines (OR = 3. 3, CI 1. 1 – 9. 7, p = 0. 03) were associated with a significant increase in the relapse rate in univariate analysis. In 590 person-years of follow-up, 24. 6 % of the patients died: 6. 4 % died during hospitalization (1. 2 % infection-related) and 13. 6 % of patients died after discharge. Conclusion Appropriate antibiotic therapy according to standard guidelines in hospitalized intravenous drug users is generally practicable and successful. In a minority alternative treatments may be indicated, although associated with a higher risk of relapse. </p...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{assess the}} {{association}} between human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) infection and onychodystrophy. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study. At our institute, we provide HTLV- 1 testing to relatives of HTLV- 1 -infected people and patients with suspected HTLV- 1 -associated diseases. The diagnosis of onychodystrophy was made clinically before testing for HTLV- 1; the number and distribution of affected nails was registered. We assessed {{the association between}} onychodystrophy and HTLV- 1 through bi- and multivariable analyses. <b>Logistic</b> <b>regression</b> was used to adjust for age, sex, and indication for HTLV- 1 testing, using six affected nails (90 th percentile) as the cut-off point. ResultsBetween April 2006 and March 2008, we included 893 subjects; their mean age was 38 years (standard deviation 19 years), and 527 (59 %) were women. Onychodystrophy {{of one or more}} nails was observed in 323 participants (36 %), and 236 subjects (26 %) were HTLV- 1 -positive. The median number of affected nails was higher in HTLV- 1 -positive than in HTLV- 1 -negative subjects (Mann–Whitney test, p < 0. 001). Thirty-eight of 97 subjects with six or more affected nails (39 %) were HTLV- 1 -infected, compared to 198 of 796 subjects with fewer than six affected nails (25 %) (crude OR 1. 9, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 2 – 3. 1; p = 0. 003). This association remained significant in the <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> model (adjusted <b>OR</b> 2. 0, 95 % CI 1. 2 – 3. 3; p = 0. 005). ConclusionsThere is an independent association between HTLV- 1 infection and onychodystrophy. Patients with an HTLV- 1 infection might have a higher risk for onychomycosis given the abnormal nail plate and a decreased T-cell-mediated immunologic response...|$|R

Therefore we have examined point prevalence and {{risk factors of}} S. aureus nasal carriage in a non-hospitalized population of Braunschweig, northern Germany. Methods: A total of 2026 potential participants were randomly selected through the resident’s registration office and invited by mail. They were requested to collect a nasal swab at home and return it by mail. S. aureus was identified by culture and PCR. <b>Logistic</b> <b>regression</b> {{was used to determine}} risk factors of S. aureus carriage. Results: Among the invitees, 405 individuals agreed to participate and 389 provided complete data which was included in the analysis. The median age of the participants was 49 years (IQR: 39 – 61) and 61 % were females. S. aureus was isolated in 85 (21. 9 %; 95 % CI: 18. 0 – 26. 2 %) of the samples, five of which were MRSA (1. 29 %; 95 % CI: 0. 55 – 2. 98 %). In <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression,</b> male sex (<b>OR</b> = 3. 50; 95 % CI: 2. 01 – 6. 11) and presence of allergies (OR = 2. 43; 95 % CI: 1. 39 – 4. 24) were found to be associated with S. aureus nasal carriage. Fifty five different spa types were found, that clustered into nine distinct groups. MRSA belonged to the hospital-associated spa types t 032 and t 025 (corresponds to MLST CC 22), whereas MSSA spa types varied and mostly belonged to spa-CC 012 (corresponds to MLST CC 30), and spa-CC 084 (corresponds to MLST CC 15).

40|$|Aim: Noninvasive Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (nCPAP) and High Flow Nasal Cannula {{oxygen therapy}} (HFNC) are {{non-invasive}} ventilation (NIV) modalities appropriate {{for children in}} developing countries. There is minimal literature describing nCPAP and HFNC use in children with respiratory compromise secondary to non-pulmonary disease. This study aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of all children without primary lung pathology, who received nCPAP and HFNC during their admission to Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of routinely collected data, between August 2015 and January 2016. Primary and secondary outcome measures were NIV failure (progression to intubation and invasive ventilation) and Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission respectively. Comparative statistics were conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests. Data significantly associated with the primary and secondary outcomes on univariate analysis were entered into backward stepwise <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> models to determine independent predictive factors. Results: There were 31 cases of nCPAP and one case of HFNC use in 31 patients (median (IQR) age 3. 5 (1. 8 – 7. 6) months. The majority (n= 23; 71. 9 %) presented with primary diarrhoeal disease. There were two deaths (6. 5 %), 17 (53. 1 %) Paediatric Intensive Care (PICU) admissions, and five (15. 6 %) cases received invasive ventilation (NIV failure). Median (IQR) duration of hospital stay was 11. 50 (6. 0 – 17. 5) days. Patients who failed NIV had lower admission SaO 2 than those without treatment failure (95 (95 - 99) % vs 100 (100 - 100) %; p = 0. 03). On <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression,</b> lower temperature (<b>OR</b> 0. 19; 95 % CI 0. 05 – 0. 78; p = 0. 02) and receiving inotropes in the emergency setting, (OR 23. 05; 95 % CI 1. 64 – 325. 06; p = 0. 02) were independently associated with PICU admission. Conclusions: nCPAP is used clinically {{for the management of}} children with respiratory compromise secondary to non-pulmonary illnesses, particularly diarrhoeal disease. Larger controlled clinical studies are needed to determine the effectiveness and utility of nCPAP in this population. HFNC was not commonly used, and this modality requires further investigation in this population...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular risk {{associated}} with diabetes may be partially attributed to left ventricular structural abnormalities. However, the relations between left ventricular structure and diabetes have not been extensively studied in African-Americans. METHODS: We studied 514 male and 965 female African-Americans 51 to 70 years old, in whom echocardiographic left ventricular mass measurements were collected for the ARIC Study. In these, we investigated the independent association of diabetes with left ventricular structural abnormalities. RESULTS: Diabetes, hypertension and obesity prevalences were 22 %, 57 % and 45 %, respectively. Unindexed left ventricular mass was higher with diabetes in both men (238. 3 ± 79. 4 g vs. 213. 7 ± 58. 6 g; p < 0. 001) and women (206. 4 ± 61. 5 g vs. 176. 9 ± 50. 1 g; p < 0. 001), respectively. Prevalence of height-indexed left ventricular hypertrophy was higher in women while increased relative wall thickness was similar in men and women. Those with diabetes had higher prevalences of height-indexed left ventricular hypertrophy (52 % vs. 32 %; p < 0. 001), and of increased relative wall thickness (73 % vs. 64 %; p = 0. 002). Gender-adjusted associations of diabetes with left ventricular hypertrophy (OR = 2. 29 95 %CI: 1. 79 – 2. 94) were attenuated after <b>multiple</b> adjustments in <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> (<b>OR</b> = 1. 50 95 %CI: 1. 12 – 2. 00). Diabetes was {{associated with}} higher left ventricle diameter (OR = 2. 13 95 %CI: 1. 28 – 3. 53) only in men and with higher wall thickness (OR = 1. 89 95 %CI: 1. 34 – 2. 66) only in women. Attenuations in diabetes associations were frequently seen after adjustment for obesity indices. CONCLUSION: In African-Americans, diabetes is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and, with different patterns of left ventricular structural abnormalities between genders. Attenuation seen in adjusted associations suggests that the higher frequency of structural abnormalities seen in diabetes {{may be due to}} factors other than hyperglycemia.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 39 - 41) A Monte Carlo {{comparison between}} a multiple linear and a <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> model was made utilizing a simple cross-validation procedure. The measure {{used to assess}} the two models was R 2, which was defined for this study as the squared correlation coefficient between the predicted outcome measure and the actual binary outcome measure. Each sample contained 50 "subjects" with one binary outcome measure and four continuous predictor variables. The predictor variables were transformed into variables with normal and u-shape distribution properties. There were 129 data sets with normal distributions and 121 data sets with u-shape distributions which were analyzed. A known population correlation matrix was used to correlate each data set. Regression coefficients and R 2 values were calculated for the original 129 normal and 121 u-shape data sets using a multiple linear and a <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> model. The obtained regression coefficients were then applied to cross-validation samples yielding another set of R 2 values. The <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> model had significantly larger R 2 values for both normal and u-shape distributions when the original data sets were evaluated. The shrinkage estimate was calculated by subtracting the R 2 cross-validation value from the corresponding R 2 original value.
