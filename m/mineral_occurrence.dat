Possible western {{extensions}} of the swarm are largely obscured by younger sedimentary cover. Paleoproterozoic inliers in northern Yukon host the Bear River dykes (BRD), herein dated by U–Pb baddeleyite and zircon methods at 1268. 5 ± 1. 5 Ma and 1264. 6 ± 1. 2 Ma.

The BRD generally strike northwest, approximately 90 ◦ to the orientation predicted by the radiating dyke model.

40|$|Geologic {{information}} extraction and integration {{are the main}} goals of this study. Tools are designed to aid in exploration for common mineral deposits by intelligently and efficiently processing spatial geological data. Gabor filters, comprising Gaussian-attenuated sinusoidal weight vectors, are used for textural discrimination. A highly non-linear logic operator was designed for "valley", "ridge", edge, and intersection extraction from multispectral images to cover most of the possible local lineament types. A zonation detector (a non-linear logic operator) indicates {{the presence or absence}} of lithologic zonation, the number and the types of zones using a series of automatically expanding moving windows. The ultimate window size represents the zonation size. Two different types of raster-based expert systems help optimize pixel-by-pixel knowledge extraction and representation over the spatial information and throughout the different raster feature layers. First a 2 -D expert system is used for classification, ranking, recognition and searching for important pattern associations in the feature space. Second, a multilayer adaptive raster-based expert system allows the processing of multiple geologic features, and operates over each pattern in the feature layers. The fuzzy integral method of evidence fusion is used to integrate information from a variety of mineral exploration sources. This nonlinearly combines objective <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrence</b> evidence, in the form of a fuzzy membership function, with subjective evaluation of the worth of the sources with respect to the decision. An application of these methods to the Tombstone mineral district in southern Arizona demonstrates its ability to pick out circular features from TM imagery, Gabor transforms and lineament patterns, as well as identify favorable zonation for new <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrence.</b> The final product at this time is a probability map to guide the exploration geologist...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bayesian {{theory was}} {{evaluated}} on the spatial analysis of geological data, to address potential areas for radioactive <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences</b> in the Poços de Caldas Plateau (750 Km 2). Spatial inference techniques were applied {{controlled by a}} prospecting model based on diagnostic criteria, represented by favorable lithology, structures features and gamma-ray intensity. In the analysis the 48 <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences</b> were used to calculate statistical parameters, that served for weighting the evidences of the model. Firstly, Contrast studies were conducted to measure the spatial correlation between the evidences and the mineral deposits. This study allowed to determine {{the threshold of the}} binary evidences, where the binary patterns present the best spatial correlation with the <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences.</b> Before the final integration, Qui-square (? 2) tests were conduct comparing the binary evidences on pairs. The goal was to measure the conditional independence between the classes of the binary evidences. Verified the independence of the binary evidences, it was calculated the Sufficiency (LS) and Necessity (LN) ratio. The natural logarithm of LS and LN, W+ and W- respectively, were added to the prior odds of the <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences,</b> controlled by {{the presence or absence of}} the potential classes of the binary evidences. This procedure yielded the posterior odds values, from where it was obtained the posterior probabilities considering the whole evidences. The resulting product was arbitrary sliced in four potential categories (null, low, medium and high). The bayesian scenario was qualitatively and quantitatively compared with previous results obtained by Boolean and Weighted Means based models. The comparison of both procedures showed that the bayesian scenario accomplished a medium performance. A target area of 27, 54 Km 2 (3, 78 % of the alkaline complex) included 27 <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences,</b> whereas each previous model encompassed only 24 in an approximately similar area. We also assessed the correlation of <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences</b> in relation to the potential classes for the different scenarios. The high and medium potential classes of the bayesian scenario showed posterior probabilities 6. 69 and 8, 39 higher than the prior probabilities. These values were, respectively, 12. 6 and 4. 97 for the same classes defined by the Weighted Means based model. For the potential class of the Boolean model this value was 5. 78. The Bayesian method showed an interesting approach for the spatial analysis. Perhaps being the major advantage, the possibility of applying statistical parameters to calculate the weights of the models evidences. Pages: 895 - 90...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Fuzzy logic, {{decision}} making procedure (AHP), and conditional probability were evaluated on the spatial analysis of geological data, to address potential areas for radioactive <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences</b> in the Poços de Caldas Plateau (≅ 750 Km 2). Spatial inference techniques were applied {{controlled by a}} prospecting model based on diagnostic criteria, represented by favorable lithology, structures features and gamma-ray intensity. The diagnostic criteria, favorable lithology and gamma-ray intensity, were converted on fuzzy members through linear functions applied over weights defined from a heuristic manner. In the lithological case linear functions were applied to spatialise the uncertainly associated with {{the location of the}} inferred boundaries. Structural features were spatialised through sigmoid functions that constitute the fuzzy members decreasingly ordered as the distance from the features increase. The crossover point of the sigmoid function was defined using the spatial correlation (conditional probability) between the diagnostic criteria and the 48 known radioactive <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences.</b> Finally the fuzzy evidence was combined through a weighted mean sum where the weights were empirically defined according to the Analytical Hierarchic Process (AHP). The resulting grid was arbitrarily sliced in four classes of potentiality (Null, low, medium and high potential), which express different levels of favorability for radioactive <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences.</b> The fuzzy scenario was qualitatively and quantitatively compared with previous results obtained by Boolean and Weighted Mean...|$|R
