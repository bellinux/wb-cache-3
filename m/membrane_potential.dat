5|$|Recently, a {{saturated}} medium-chain {{fatty acid}} called decanoic acid (C10) has shown promise {{in both the}} control of seizures and of neurodegeneration. Decanoic acid is a major constituent of the MCT ketogenic diet, and the authors suggest its action may be through inducing mitochondrial biogenesis and helping provide more ATP to maintain the resting <b>membrane</b> <b>potential</b> of the neuron.|$|E
5|$|Regulating ER {{release of}} Ca2+ at the MAM is {{especially}} critical because only a certain window of Ca2+ uptake sustains the mitochondria, and consequently the cell, at homeostasis. Sufficient intraorganelle Ca2+ signaling {{is required to}} stimulate metabolism by activating dehydrogenase enzymes critical to flux through the citric acid cycle. However, once Ca2+ signaling in the mitochondria passes a certain threshold, it stimulates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in part by collapsing the mitochondrial <b>membrane</b> <b>potential</b> required for metabolism. Studies examining the role of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors support this model; for example, the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 {{has been shown to}} interact with IP3Rs to reduce Ca2+ filling of the ER, leading to reduced efflux at the MAM and preventing collapse of the mitochondrial <b>membrane</b> <b>potential</b> post-apoptotic stimuli. Given the need for such fine regulation of Ca2+ signaling, it is perhaps unsurprising that dysregulated mitochondrial Ca2+ has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, while the catalogue of tumor suppressors includes a few that are enriched at the MAM.|$|E
5|$|The two {{components}} of the proton-motive force are thermodynamically equivalent: In mitochondria, the largest part of energy {{is provided by the}} potential; in alkaliphile bacteria the electrical energy even has to compensate for a counteracting inverse pH difference. Inversely, chloroplasts operate mainly on ΔpH. However, they also require a small <b>membrane</b> <b>potential</b> for the kinetics of ATP synthesis. In the case of the fusobacterium Propionigenium modestum it drives the counter-rotation of subunits a and c of the FO motor of ATP synthase.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to extracellular fluid, cytosol {{has a high}} concentration of potassium ions and a low concentration of sodium ions. This difference in ion concentrations is critical for osmoregulation, since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by osmosis - since the levels of macromolecules inside cells are higher than their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions are expelled and potassium ions taken up by the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, potassium ions then flow down their concentration gradient through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative <b>membrane</b> <b>potential.</b> To balance this potential difference, negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss of sodium and chloride ions compensates for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.|$|E
5|$|Most of the ATP {{synthesized}} in the mitochondria will be {{used for}} cellular processes in the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane contains an antiporter, the ADP/ATP translocase, which is an integral membrane protein used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for ADP in the intermembrane space. This translocase is driven by the <b>membrane</b> <b>potential,</b> as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient.|$|E
5|$|Brain tissue consumes a {{large amount}} of energy in {{proportion}} to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (<b>membrane</b> <b>potential)</b> of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.|$|E

5|$|It {{contains}} more than 151 different polypeptides, and has a very high protein-to-phospholipid ratio (more than 3:1 by weight, which is about 1protein for 15phospholipids). The inner membrane is home to around 1/5 of the total protein in a mitochondrion. In addition, the inner membrane is rich in an unusual phospholipid, cardiolipin. This phospholipid was originally discovered in cow hearts in 1942, and is usually characteristic of mitochondrial and bacterial plasma membranes. Cardiolipin contains four fatty acids rather than two, and may help to make the inner membrane impermeable. Unlike the outer membrane, the inner membrane doesn't contain porins, and is highly impermeable to all molecules. Almost all ions and molecules require special membrane transporters to enter or exit the matrix. Proteins are ferried into the matrix via the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) complex or via Oxa1. In addition, there is a <b>membrane</b> <b>potential</b> across the inner membrane, formed {{by the action of}} the enzymes of the electron transport chain.|$|E
5|$|When the sinoatrial {{cells are}} resting, {{they have a}} {{negative}} charge on their membranes. However a rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane's charge to become positive. This is called depolarisation and occurs spontaneously. Once the cell has a sufficiently high charge, the sodium channels close and calcium ions then begin to enter the cell, shortly after which potassium begins to leave it. All the ions travel through ion channels in the membrane of the sinoatrial cells. The potassium and calcium only start {{to move out of}} and into the cell once it has a sufficiently high charge, and so are called voltage-gated. Shortly after this, the calcium channels close and potassium channels open, allowing potassium to leave the cell. This causes the cell to have a negative resting charge and is called repolarization. When the <b>membrane</b> <b>potential</b> reaches approximately −60 mV, the potassium channels close and the process may begin again.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria (and related structures) {{are found}} in all eukaryotes (except one—the Oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp.). Although {{commonly}} depicted as bean-like structures they form a highly dynamic network {{in the majority of}} cells where they constantly undergo fission and fusion. Mitochondria vary in number and location according to cell type. A single mitochondrion is often found in unicellular organisms. Conversely, numerous mitochondria {{are found in}} human liver cells, with about 1000–2000 mitochondria per cell, making up 1/5 of the cell volume. The population of all the mitochondria of a given cell constitutes the chondriome. The mitochondrial content of otherwise similar cells can vary substantially in size and <b>membrane</b> <b>potential,</b> with differences arising from sources including uneven partitioning at cell divisions, leading to extrinsic differences in ATP levels and downstream cellular processes. The mitochondria can be found nestled between myofibrils of muscle or wrapped around the sperm flagellum. Often, they form a complex 3D branching network inside the cell with the cytoskeleton. The association with the cytoskeleton determines mitochondrial shape, which can affect the function as well: different structures of the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical, chemical, and signalling advantages or disadvantages. Mitochondria in cells are always distributed along microtubules and the distribution of these organelles is also correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent evidence suggests that vimentin, one of the components of the cytoskeleton, is also critical to the association with the cytoskeleton.|$|E

40|$|Patch-clamp {{measurements}} on freshly isolated embryonic chicken osteoclasts revealed three distinct types of voltage-dependent K+ conductance. The first type of conductance, present in 72 % of the cells, activated at <b>membrane</b> <b>potentials</b> less negative than - 30 to - 20 mV and reached full activation at + 40 mV. It activated with a delay, reached a peak value, and then inactivated {{with a time}} constant of approximately 1. 5 s. Inactivation was complete or almost so. Recovery from inactivation, at - 70 mV, had a time constant of roughly 1 s. The conductance could be blocked, at least partly, by 4 mM 4 -aminopyridine. The second type of conductance (present in all cells) activated at <b>membrane</b> <b>potentials</b> more negative than - 40 to - 80 mV and reached full activation at - 130 mV.

25|$|Thus, a {{voltage-gated}} {{ion channel}} tends to be open for some values of the <b>membrane</b> <b>potential,</b> and closed for others. In most cases, however, the relationship between <b>membrane</b> <b>potential</b> and channel state is probabilistic and involves a time delay.

These proteins are highly selective for sodium ions. They open very fast to depolarize the cell <b>membrane</b> <b>potential,</b> causing the upstroke of an action potential. Normally, the sodium channels close very rapidly, but the depolarization of the <b>membrane</b> <b>potential</b> causes the opening (activation) of potassium channels and potassium efflux, which results in repolarization of the <b>membrane</b> <b>potential.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{course of}} the action {{potential}} {{can be divided into}} five parts: the rising phase, the peak phase, the falling phase, the undershoot phase, and the refractory period. During the rising phase the <b>membrane</b> <b>potential</b> depolarizes (becomes more positive). The point at which depolarization stops is called the peak phase. At this stage, the <b>membrane</b> <b>potential</b> reaches a maximum. Subsequent to this, there is a falling phase. During this stage the <b>membrane</b> <b>potential</b> becomes more negative, returning towards resting potential. The undershoot, or afterhyperpolarization, phase is the period during which the <b>membrane</b> <b>potential</b> temporarily becomes more negatively charged than when at rest (hyperpolarized).

40|$|How {{does the}} {{information}} of spatiotemporal sequence {{stemming from the}} hippocampal CA 3 area affect the postsynaptic <b>membrane</b> <b>potentials</b> of the hippocampal CA 1 neurons? In a recent study, we observed hierarchical clusters {{of the distribution of}} <b>membrane</b> <b>potentials</b> of CA 1 neurons, arranged according to the history of input sequences (Fukushima et al 2007). In the present paper, we deal with the dynamical mechanism generating such a hierarchical distribution. The recording data were investigated using return map analysis. We also deal with a collective behavior at population level, using a reconstructed multi-cell recording data set. At both individual cell and population levels, a return map of the response sequence of CA 1 pyramidal cells was well approximated by a set of contractive affine transformations, where the transformations represent self-organized rules by which the input pattern sequences are encoded. These findings provide direct evidence that the information of temporal sequences generated in CA 3 can be self-similarly represented in the <b>membrane</b> <b>potentials</b> of CA 1 pyramidal cells...|$|R
40|$|To clarify how the {{information}} of spatiotemporal {{sequence of the}} hippocampal CA 3 affects the postsynaptic <b>membrane</b> <b>potentials</b> of single pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA 1, the spatio-temporal stimuli was delivered to Schaffer collaterals of the CA 3 through a pair of electrodes and the post-synaptic <b>membrane</b> <b>potentials</b> were recorded using the patch-clamp recording method.
