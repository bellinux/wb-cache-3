The socio-economic burden will increase as with continuous aging of our population. In addition, both prevalence and incidence figures of adhesive capsulitis are increasing. No literature overview solely focuses on the physiotherapeutic options in patients with adhesive capsulitis and their scientific evidence. Moreover, although some physiotherapeutic interventions show evidence regarding reducing pain or increasing mobility, {{there is little evidence}} to suggest that the disease prognosis is affected and this raises the need for new, innovative {{research in the area of}} adhesive capsulitis and its treatment. By presenting its current evidence, we hope to retrieve several gaps in the present management of adhesive capsulitis by physiotherapists and provide us with new insights for improving the physiotherapists' policy in treating adhesive capsulitis patients, e. g., continuously increasing nociceptive impulse activity, as in early stages of adhesive capsulitis, could lead to peripheral and subsequently long-lasting central sensitization, as well as to an increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system.

40|$|Background and Purpose. Several {{factors such}} as posture, muscle force, range of motion, and {{scapular}} dysfunction are commonly believed to contribute to shoulder impingement. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare 3 -dimensional scapular kinematics, shoulder range of motion, shoulder muscle force, and posture in subjects with and without primary shoulder impingement syndrome. Subjects. Forty-five subjects with impingement syndrome were recruited and compared with 45 subjects without known pathology or impairments matched by age, sex, and hand dominance. Methods. Shoulder motion and thoracic spine posture were measured goniometrically, and force was measured with a dynamometer. An electromagnetic motion analysis system was used to capture shoulder kinematics during active elevation in both the sagittal and scapular planes as well as during external rotation with the arm at 90 degrees of elevation in the frontal plane. Results. The impingement group demonstrated slightly greater scapu-lar upward rotation and clavicular elevation during flexion and slightly greater scapular posterior tilt and clavicular retraction during scapular-plane elevation compared with the control group. The impingement group demonstrated less range of motion and force in all directions compared with the control group. There were no differences in resting posture between the groups. Discussion and Conclusion. The kine-matic differences found in subjects with impingement may represent scapulothoracic compensatory strategies for glenohumeral weakness or <b>motion</b> <b>loss.</b> The decreased range of motion and force found in subjects with impingement support rehabilitation approaches that focus on strengthening and restoring flexibility.

30|$|Akin to our {{findings}} within, recently a rat model of post-traumatic elbow contracture {{was developed and}} demonstrated to possess persistent joint <b>motion</b> <b>loss</b> and increased capsule thickening. This model, which utilizes focal peri-elbow soft tissue damage and subsequent immobilization to induce elbow stiffness is, to our knowledge, the only other small animal model of elbow stiffness currently reported (Dunham et al. 2017 a; Dunham et al. 2017 b; Lake et al. 2016). Here, in our murine model, we observed loss of joint function and capsule thickening (as reported in the rat model above), as well as tissue scaring, fibrosis, and {{of the formation of}} heterotopic ossification; all pathologies suggested clinically to impact elbow stiffness. Yet, this model is not without limitations. Specifically, the cardiotoxin injury method cannot localize the injury to a single type of soft tissue, therefore we cannot partition plasmin’s role in skin, tendon, skeletal muscle, and capsule healing individually as they pertain to elbow stiffness. Additionally, this study did not utilize post-operative immobilization of the affected limb, yet this current model could be utilized to examine such a hypothesis. Finally, while the elbow is highly susceptible to impaired function and stiffness following traumatic injury, we hypothesize that this model {{has the potential to be}} translated to other joints, such as the knee, hip, or shoulder, given that each of these joints have been found clinically to be susceptible to pathologic calcification, fibrosis, and impaired soft tissue healing following injury.|$|E
30|$|Eight studies {{reported}} functional outcomes in either outcome scores or by categorizing patients as ‘excellent,’ ‘good,’ ‘fair,’ or ‘poor’ based on various criteria. Haxhija et al. [108] used {{the criteria of}} axial deviation less than 9 °, range-of-motion deficiency of less than 19 °, minimal strength or functional loss, and no pain as their criteria for a good or excellent outcome; all patients in their study underwent open reduction and internal fixation with K-wires. Lee et al. used the Elbow Assessment Score of the Japanese Orthopedic Association, a 100 -point score where 100 points corresponds to the best possible score. At final follow-up, the average score was 96.2 points (89 – 100). These authors used K-wires, screws, tension band wire, or suture to fix their fractures [109]. Farsetti et al. used the criteria of no symptoms, no atrophy, no osteoarthritis, negative valgus stress, and less than 10 ° <b>motion</b> <b>loss</b> as their criteria for good or excellent results. Sixteen of 19 non-operative patients and 15 of 17 operative patients had a good result. The remainder of the patients in these two groups had a fair result. Six patients were treated with excision of the osseous fragment and the repair of soft tissues. This was associated with two of six fair results and four of six poor results [10]. Bede et al. [3] classified results as good if, subjectively, the elbow was functional, pain-free, and free from instability or deformity, and, objectively, the range of motion was limited by 15 ° or less, there was less than 6 ° of cubitus valgus, and no ulnar neuritis. If these criteria were not met, the result {{was considered to be}} poor. Bede et al. [3] found that ten of 16 patients who had operative treatment had good results, compared to 27 of 34 patients who had non-operative treatment. The remainder of the results was poor. Hines et al. also used Bede’s criteria. However, they found 23 of 24 of their operatively treated patients to have experienced good outcomes [6]. The patient who did not have a good outcome was reported to have had a painful non-union [6]. Skak et al. [110] defined excellent outcomes as full range of motion, normal appearance, and no symptoms; good outcome as less than 15 ° of range of <b>motion</b> <b>loss,</b> minor deformity, and no arthritic or neurologic symptoms; poor outcome included disabling loss of motion, noticeable deformity, or any arthritic or neurologic symptoms. Eighteen of 21 of their operatively treated patients and two of three of non-operatively treated patients had good or excellent outcomes. The outcome was poor in the remainder of the patients [110]. The poor results were due to ulnar neuritis in two patients, an extension lag in one patient, and deformity due to a concomitant lateral condyle fracture [110]. Ip and Tsang [112] used the Mayo Clinic Score, which has 45 points for pain, 10 points for stability, 20 points for range of motion, and 25 points for activities of daily living. Four patients were treated conservatively; their Mayo scores at follow-up ranged from 90 to 100 (average 96.25). Overall, patients who underwent operative treatment had Mayo scores that ranged from 80 to 100 (average 93) [112].|$|E

Detection of early blood-induced joint changes may improve monitoring of treatment. The {{aim of this}} study was to explore the value of routine ultrasound in detecting early joint abnormalities in children with haemophilia on prophylaxis. METHODS: Sixty-four joints in 32 children with haemophilia were examined by one operator using the Haemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection with UltraSound protocol during annual multidisciplinary follow-up. Based on reported bleeding, the joint with the highest risk of blood-induced joint damage and the contralateral joint were examined. At the same day, clinical function was assessed according to the Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS). RESULTS: Median age was 11. 5 years (range = 5. 5 - 16. 4). Out of the 64 examined joints, one ankle was excluded because of previous surgery. Median lifetime joint bleeds/joint was three (interquartile ranges = 1 - 5). Clinical function of most joints was perfect: only 7 / 49 joints with reported bleeds scored positive due to swelling, muscle atrophy and/or range of <b>motion</b> <b>loss</b> (HJHS range = 1 - 2 points). Ultrasound showed abnormalities in 5 / 49 joints with reported bleeding, and 4 / 5 showed positive HJHS scores. Ultrasound abnormalities were present in 1 / 56 joints (1. 8 %, CI: 0. 1 - 9. 6 %) without loss of clinical function. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound abnormalities were found during routine evaluation of joints in children with haemophilia on prophylaxis. Most joints with ultrasound abnormalities showed low HJHS scores too. Ultrasound could be used to evaluate whether minimal losses of clinical function might be caused by anatomical changes...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of intermittent femoral and sciatic nerve blocks combined with an in-house physiotherapy protocol for treating postoperative knee stiffness. Sixty-eight patients with postoperative knee stiffness were evaluated for passive knee flexion and extension at different time points, beginning preoperatively and continuing throughout a median 10 -month follow-up after mobilization intervention. Sciatic and femoral nerve catheters were activated 1 hour prior to each physiotherapy session, which was performed twice per day and supported by a continuous passive range of motion machine. Median time from admission to catheter removal was 4 days (range, 1 - 8 days). Mean hospital length of stay was 7 days (range, 2 - 19 days). Overall mean flexion increased significantly from pretreatment (74 °) to discharge (109 °; P<. 01). There was no significant difference in mean flexion at 6 -week follow-up compared with that at discharge (108 °; P=. 764), but there was a significant increase in flexion at final follow-up (120 °; P=. 002). Overall mean knee extension lag decreased significantly from pretreatment (5 °) to discharge (0. 4 °; P=. 001). There was no significant increase in mean extension lag from discharge to final follow-up (1 °; P=. 2). Overall, 11 patients underwent revision surgery for persistent stiffness. This novel protocol for continuous knee mobilization under perineural blocks is a valuable alternative to knee manipulation under anesthesia for this select group of procedures.

Methods. Fifty patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and 50 control subjects were evaluated using an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex 6. 000) regarding the following parameters: peak torque, peak torque angle, power, total work, peak torque acceleration time, set total work, torque acceleration energy ('explosion') and endurance. Comparisons between rheumatoid arthritis and the control group, left side versus right side, flexors and extensors and the proportion between flexors and extensors were made. the subjects were also evaluated through the Health Assessment Questionnaire, visual and analogical scale of pain, EPM-ROM and goniometry of the knee. Results. the results showed that patients with rheumatoid arthritis have less strength than the control group (P < 0. 05); the extensors are stronger than the flexors (P < 0. 05); no significant differences between the right and the left knee for rheumatoid arthritis and the control group were observed and the proportion between flexors and extensors is the same in both groups. We concluded that regarding the isokinetic parameters, the knees of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis are different from normal knees with decreased strength parameters, maintaining the proportion between flexors and extensors with a global loss of strength in the segment, excluding the high speeds in some of the parameters.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Much {{controversy}} {{still exists}} surrounding graft choice in {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) reconstruction. Over the past decade, an increase in comparative studies with longer follow-up has enhanced our understanding of current graft options and outcomes. PURPOSE: To describe the long-term comparative outcomes of ACL reconstruction with autograft bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) versus autograft hamstring (HS) ACL reconstruction with regard to clinical and radiographic outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Scopus databases was performed to identify studies in the English language with outcome data comparing ACL reconstruction utilizing autograft BPTB and autograft HS; only studies with a minimum 5 -year follow-up were included. Outcome data included failure and complications, manual and instrumented laxity, patient-reported outcomes, and radiographic risk of osteoarthritis. RESULTS: Twelve studies {{with a total of}} 953 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, 8 were level 1 evidence and 2 were level 2. Mean follow-up was 8. 96 years (range, 5 - 15. 3 years). No differences in graft failure or manual or instrumented laxity were seen in any studies. Lower clinical outcomes scores and greater <b>motion</b> <b>loss</b> were seen in BPTB patients in 1 and 2 studies, respectively. Two of 4 studies reporting on anterior knee pain, and 3 of 7 that recorded kneeling pain found it more frequently among BPTB patients. One study found significantly increased reoperation rates in HS patients, while another found a similar result in BPTB, and 1 study reported a significant increase in contralateral ACL tears in BPTB patients. Three of 5 studies reporting on radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis noted significantly increased rates in BPTB patients. CONCLUSION: This systematic review comparing long-term outcomes after ACL reconstruction with either autograft BPTB or autograft HS suggests no significant differences in manual/instrumented laxity and graft failures between graft types. An increase in long-term anterior knee pain, kneeling pain, and higher rates of osteoarthritis were noted with BPTB graft use...|$|E

The main difference being that in the present work the energy emitted is explicitly calculated solving the equation of motion without further approximations. It is expected that the present analysis may be useful when studying the analogous problem of dissipation in gravitational systems. Comment: Typos in Refs. corrected. Other minor change...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we are aiming at more insight in {{morbidity}} after {{head and neck}} cancer treatment (resection of the primary tumour, neck dissection and pre-or post-operative radiation therapy). We will study shoulder complaints {{and the role of}} the spinal accessory nerve, pain and the underlying pain mechanisms, range of <b>motion,</b> and <b>loss</b> of sensation. The consequences of dysfunction such as shoulder disability and activities of daily living, but also psychological problems (depression) and quality of life will be analysed. This thesis aims at a better understanding of consequences of type of neck dissection, especially the supraomohyoid neck dissection and the influence of radiation therapy. A better understanding of morbidity after cancer treatment must lead to specific rehabilitation treatment options in the near future. ...|$|R
