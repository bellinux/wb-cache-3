In this report a simple explicit solution is given which is applicable to {{many different types of}} problems. It is shown to be applicable to problems which involve optimization of constant-coefficient guidance systems and time-varying homing type systems for several stationary and nonstationary inputs.

The solution is given in generalized form in terms of the <b>minimum</b> <b>theoretical</b> error, the optimum transfer functions, and the optimum transient response.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{operational}} observations, carried out on a metro line, equipped with ATP, the achievement {{is to develop a}} theoretical formulation of the reliability concept through definition of suitable indices, focussing its aleatory components. It is proved, more over, through data coming from a case study, how automation in line operation reduce variability of such aleatory components, increasing reliability. Headway reliability {{is one of the most}} important factors for evaluation of the quality of an underground railway operation. Control and regulation actions have the scope to restore a regular headway of train transit when they shift from the theoretical sequence due to a perturbation. For this reason reliability has been chosen as parameter to evaluate the effects of automation introduction in some operational aspects. It has been defined a reliability index which is the difference between real <b>headway</b> and <b>theoretical</b> <b>headway,</b> measured in a given section of the line. Furthermore a reliability coefficient represent a percentage of reliability index average. Actual headway is a aleatory quantity depending on other aleatory quantities like running times, stop times and times for the headline operations. The concept of the adopted theoretical model is that headway between two train running a certain section is a sum of terms depending upon running time of the section itself, transit time through stations and headline operation time...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTime headway is of {{fundamental}} importance in traffic engineering. For {{any of the}} traffic simulations to address traffic problems to be effective, accurate vehicle generation is essential. Previous research into this subject has focused on stochastic modeling for uninterrupted facilities. Yet little researches for an interrupted facility have been performed. This paper proposed <b>theoretical</b> <b>headway</b> models for a suburban arterial in Korea. Using the laser sensor-based traffic detector, {{a large amount of}} accurate headway data was obtained. To analyze by traffic flow states, the headway data were divided into five flow states. Subsequent runs test rejected the randomness for the 5 - 9 v/m flow. Hence, theoretical modeling for the remaining flow (10 - 14 v/m, 15 - 19 v/m, 20 - 24 v/m, and 25 - 29 v/m) is performed. The goodness of fit tests by Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) statistic revealed that the Johnson SB model for 10 - 14 v/m flow, the Johnson SU model for the other three flows fitted best. The Log-Logistic model was second-best for 20 - 24 and 25 - 29 v/m flow. The Log-normal model was also accepted for 25 - 29 v/m flow. Some analyses not only on the statistics of the headway, but the fitted model exhibited somewhat different characteristics compared to those of the headway from uninterrupted facilities. This paper can provide better understanding of the headway from interrupted facilities and starting point for developing a well-descriptive simulation model for signalized arterials...|$|R
