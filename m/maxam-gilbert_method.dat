2500|$|In {{addition}} to his seminal work on the amino acid sequence of insulin, Frederick Sanger and his colleagues {{played a key role}} in the development of DNA sequencing techniques that enabled the establishment of comprehensive genome sequencing projects. In 1975, he and Alan Coulson published a sequencing procedure using DNA polymerase with radiolabelled nucleotides that he called the Plus and Minus technique. This involved two closely related methods that generated short oligonucleotides with defined 3' termini. These could be fractionated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel (called polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and visualised using autoradiography. The procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement, but was still very laborious. [...] Nevertheless, in 1977 his group was able to sequence most of the 5,386 nucleotides of the single-stranded bacteriophage φX174, completing the first fully sequenced DNA-based genome. The refinement of the Plus and Minus method resulted in the chain-termination, or Sanger method (see below), which formed the basis of the techniques of DNA sequencing, genome mapping, data storage, and bioinformatic analysis most widely used in the following quarter-century of research. In the same year Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam of Harvard University independently developed the <b>Maxam-Gilbert</b> <b>method</b> (also known as the chemical method) of DNA sequencing, involving the preferential cleavage of DNA at known bases, a less efficient method. For their groundbreaking work in the sequencing of nucleic acids, Gilbert and Sanger shared half the 1980 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Paul Berg (recombinant DNA).|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{initiation}} {{sites of}} the Galleria mellonella L. nuclear polyhedrosis virus (G. m. NPV) DNA replication were revealed. For this purpose SCLd 135 cells permitting the G. m. NPV productive reproduction were transformed by the recombinant plasmids containing the viral genome individual fragments in pRSF 2124 and pBR 322 vectors. It was revealed that 2 of the 32 recombinant plasmids can autonomously replicate in the eucaryotic cells. According to the <b>Maxam-Gilbert</b> <b>method</b> the DNA G. m. NPV fragment (1300 bp) primary structure of pHBR plasmid was determined. The structure analysis revealed the typical regulator signals as in the replicons.

40|$|AbstractRNA of a flavivirus, tick-borne {{encephalitis}} virus (TBEV; strain Sofjin), {{was subjected to}} reverse transcription and the DNA copy was transformed into double-stranded DNA {{by the action of}} E. coli DNA-polymerase I (Klenow fragment). This DNA was annealed with plasmid pBR 322. The recombinant plasmids were cloned in E. coli K 802. The nucleotide sequence of the inserts of the clones, coding for region structural proteins C, M, E and nonstructural protein NS 1, was determined by the <b>Maxam-Gilbert</b> <b>method.</b> The genes of structural proteins form a compact cluster. Homology has been studied of the TBEV sequences found with the structures of proteins and RNAs of other flaviviruses, yellow fever virus and West Nile virus, and a high degree of homology was found...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of gene 19 of bacteriophage T 4, the structural gene {{of the tail}} tube protein, was determined by both the dideoxy and the <b>Maxam-Gilbert</b> <b>methods.</b> The predicted Mr of tube protein gene product 19 is 18, 842. The N-terminal amino acid of the tube protein was determined by Edman degradation, and the C-terminal sequence was confirmed by isolation of the C-terminal tryptic peptide. In the noncoding region between genes 18 and 19, there are two late-T 4 -promoter consensus sequences, 51 bases apart. The implication of the two late promoter sequences was examined by an S 1 nuclease protection experiment. Both serve as weak promoters, {{but the bulk of}} the transcripts arise from further upstream of the two promoters...|$|R
25|$|From 1977–1980, Brosius spent a {{postdoctoral}} fellowship {{supported by}} the Fogarty International Center in Harry F. Noller’s lab at the University of California, Santa Cruz. There, he sequenced the first large ribosomal RNAs via their genes utilizing the <b>Maxam-Gilbert</b> sequencing <b>method.</b> It took ~2.5 years to sequence the 7.5 kilobases encompassing the entire rrnB rRNA operon in addition to some flanking regions. Although the chemical method was cumbersome, sequences could be determined entirely void of errors.|$|R
50|$|Maxam-Gilbert {{sequencing}} is {{a method}} of DNA sequencing developed by Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert in 1976-1977. This method is based on nucleobase-specific partial chemical modification of DNA and subsequent cleavage of the DNA backbone at sites adjacent to the modified nucleotides. Maxam-Gilbert sequencing was the first widely adopted method for DNA sequencing, and, along with the Sanger dideoxy method, represents {{the first generation of}} DNA sequencing <b>methods.</b> <b>Maxam-Gilbert</b> sequencing is no longer in widespread use, having been supplanted by next-generation sequencing methods.|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of gene 18 of bacteriophage T 4 {{was determined by}} the <b>Maxam-Gilbert</b> <b>method,</b> partially aided by the dideoxy method. To confirm the deduced amino acid sequence of the tail sheath protein (gp 18) that is encoded by gene 18, gp 18 was extensively digested by trypsin or lysyl endopeptidase and subjected to reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Approximately 40 peptides, which cover 88 % of the primary structure, were fractionated, the amino acid compositions were determined, and the corresponding sequences in DNA were identified. Furthermore, the amino acid sequences of 10 of the 40 peptides were determined by a gas phase protein sequencer, including N- and C-terminal sequences. Thus, the complete amino acid sequence of gp 18, which consists of 658 amino acids with a molecular weight of 71, 160, was determined...|$|E
40|$|BmFTZ-F 1 is a Bombyx mori {{homologue}} of FTZ-F 1, {{a positive}} regulator of the fushi tarazu gene of Drosophila melanogaster. In {{order to determine}} the sequence recognized with this factor, we made three sets of oligonucleotide mixture which contain 4 possible nucleotides at different positions within the previously proposed 12 -bp binding consensus sequence. Oligonucleotides which bound to purified BmFTZ-F 1 were separated by a gel mobility shift procedure and a binding sequence was determined by direct sequencing through <b>Maxam-Gilbert</b> <b>method.</b> By this analysis, 7 positions showed clear sequence preference and 5 positions showed weak or no sequence preference. The importance of each nucleotide at each position was confirmed by a gel mobility shift competition analysis and results were presented as a quantitative difference in the binding affinity. From these analyses, we conclude that the best binding sequence of BmFTZ-F 1 is 5 '-PyCAAGGPyCPu- 3 '. This method may be useful for the determination of a binding sequence of other sequence specific DNA binding factor...|$|E
40|$|The {{naturally}} occurring modified nucleoside 3 -[3 -amino- 3 -carboxypropyl]- 1 -methylpseudouridine (abbreviated am psi) {{is found in}} eukaryotic 18 S rRNA. We localized am psi to sequence resolution in D. melanogaster 18 S rRNA. This hypermodified base causes an absolute stop in cDNA elongation. The RNA sequence bearing am psi was determined by dideoxy-sequencing with reverse transcriptase. The rDNA coding for {{this part of the}} 18 S rRNA was sequenced by the <b>Maxam-Gilbert</b> <b>method.</b> Together these two sequencing methods can be used to position the cDNA stop (am psi) in the rRNA sequence. Chemical evidence for the existence of am psi in this RNA sequence was obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of 18 S rRNA nucleosides from radioactive-labeled cells. L-[2 - 14 C] methionine will selectively label am psi in eukaryotic 18 S rRNA. Using HPLC, we found a single 14 C-labeled nucleotide in digests of 18 S rRNA. This nucleotide is in the RNA sequence bearing the cDNA stop since a restriction fragment which hybridizes to this sequence protects the modified base from RNase T 1 digestion...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} direct {{technique}} {{for determining the}} binding sites of small molecules on naturally occurring heterogeneous DNA. Methidiumpropyl-EDTA. Fe(II) [MPE. Fe(II) cleaves double helical DNA with low sequence specificity. Using a combination of MPE. Fe(II) cleavage of drug-protected DNA fragments and <b>Maxam-Gilbert</b> gel <b>methods</b> of sequence analysis, we have determined the preferred binding sites on a Rsa I-EcoRI restriction fragment from pBR 322 for the intercalator actinomycin D and the minor groove binders netropsin and distamycin A. Netropsin and distamycin A gave identical DNA cleavage-inhibition patterns and bound preferentially to A+T-rich regions with a minimal protected site of four base pairs. We were able to observe the effect of increasing concentration on site selection by netropsin and distamycin A. Actinomycin D afforded a completely different cleavage-inhibition pattern, with 4 - to 16 -base-pair-long protected regions centered around one or more G. C base pairs...|$|R

Methidiumpropyl-EDTA·Fe(II) (MPE·Fe[II]) (Hertzberg and Dervan 1982) cleaves double-helical DNA with low sequence-specificity (Van Dyke et al. 1982). Using a combination of MPE·Fe(II) partial cleavage of drug-protected DNA fragments and <b>Maxam-Gilbert</b> sequencing <b>methods,</b> we determined the drug-protected sites on one strand of a double-helical fragment from pBR 322 for the intercalator actinomycin D (Goldberg et al. 1962; Muller and Crothers 1968; Wells and Larson 1970; Sobell 1973; Krugh 1981; Patel et al. 1981; Takusagawa et al. 1982) and the minor-groove binders netropsin and distamycin A (Luck et al. 1974; Wartell et al. 1974; Zimmer 1975; Berman et al. 1979; Krylov et al. 1979).

25|$|Traditional DNA {{sequencing}} {{techniques such}} as <b>Maxam-Gilbert</b> or Sanger <b>methods</b> used polyacrylamide gels to separate DNA fragments differing by a single base-pair in length so the sequence could be read. Most modern DNA separation methods now use agarose gels, except for particularly small DNA fragments. It is currently most often used {{in the field of}} immunology and protein analysis, often used to separate different proteins or isoforms of the same protein into separate bands. These can be transferred onto a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane to be probed with antibodies and corresponding markers, such as in a western blot.|$|R
40|$|Several {{functions}} of the retrovirus genome involve structural features {{in the vicinity of}} its 5 ' terminus. In an effort to further elucidate the relationship between structure and function in retrovirus RNA, we have determined the sequence of the first 1, 010 nucleotides at the 5 ' end of the genome of Rous sarcoma virus by using the <b>Maxam-Gilbert</b> <b>method</b> to sequence suitable domains in cloned Rous sarcoma virus DNA. The results (i) locate the initiation codon for the gag gene of Rous sarcoma virus 372 nucleotides from the 5 ' end of viral RNA; (ii) demonstrate that this codon is preceded by three methionine codons that are apparently not used in translation; (iii) sustain previous conclusions that the principal site to which ribosomes bind on the Rous sarcoma virus genome in vitro does not contain the initiation codon for gag; (iv) permit deduction of the amino acid sequence of a viral structural protein, p 19; (v) confirm the amino-terminal sequence of Pr 76 gag; and (vi) substantiate the identification of a splice donor site described in the accompanying manuscript (Hackett et al., J. Virol., 41 : 527 - 534, 1982) ...|$|E
40|$|The bovine genome {{is known}} to contain two main {{repetitive}} sequence types. Tandemly repeated satellite sequences represent about 20 % and short interspersed repeated sequences 6 - 10 % of the total DNA. No other major classes of repetitive DNA have been detected in the bovine genome. Hybridization kinetic experiments have indicated about 12 kinetic families of the short interspersed repeated DNA sequences (Mayfield, et al., 1980). Evidence presented here shows that these kinetic families are sequence related;Bovine DNA was shotgun cloned into pBR 322 and 26 clones containing repetitive DNA were examined. Two of these clones, pPGA 7 and pPGB 9, were studied in detail. Restriction endonuclease maps indicate that the repetitive unit in each clone {{is limited to a}} few hundred base pairs. pPGB 9 and 21 out of the remaining 25 clones hybridize to pPGA 7. Trace amounts of labelled genomic calf thymus DNA were hybridized with excess clone DNA. The results indicate that the sequence family represented in pPGA 7 and pPGB 9 comprises about 6 % of the genome. This suggests that most, if not all, of the short interspersed repeated sequences in the bovine genome belong to the same sequence family;Both clones were subcloned into bacteriophage M 13, and partially sequenced using the method developed by Sanger. A subfragment of pPGA 7 was also sequenced by the <b>Maxam-Gilbert</b> <b>method.</b> The DNA sequences resulting from both sequencing methods were compared to each other, to the human Alu sequences, and to a bovine repetitious DNA sequence located near the bovine corticotropin-beta-lipotropin precursor gene (Watanabe, et al., 1982);References;Mayfield, John E., Julie F.
