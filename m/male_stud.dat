50|$|As a {{relatively}} new breed, most Australian Mist catteries are in Australia; however, {{there are a few}} in the UK, and some neutered/spayed cats have been introduced to America and several other countries. The UK breeder who brought the first Australian Mist cats to the UK was Mary Stuart. Two pregnant queens arrived in the UK in February 2007. From those initial queens and a further imported mature <b>male</b> <b>stud</b> boy and one other unrelated queen in August 2007, a colony of over 100 cats was created within two years in the UK. In July 2010, when a further six cats had been imported into the UK from Australia, there was the chance to widen the gene pool and offer healthy and genetically-sound kittens to pet buyers within the UK and the US. Breeding cats have been sent to Norway where two breeders are currently working to get them recognised by FIFE.|$|E
40|$|The {{olfactory}} {{block to}} pregnancy in mice {{is caused by}} a primer pheromone acting via the accessory olfactory system which projects to the mediobasal hypothalamus via the corticomedial amygdala. Only pheromones from males that are different to those of the <b>stud</b> (strange <b>male</b> pheromones) block pregnancy-hence mating "imprints" recognition of <b>stud</b> <b>male</b> pheromones. The olfactory bulbs receive centrifugal noradrenergic projections from the brainstem via the medial olfactory striae, which terminate in both main and accessory bulbs. Removal of these projections by injection of 6 -hydroxydopamine into the striae, 6 days prior to mating, effectively depletes olfactory bulb noradrenaline and results in a failure by the female to recognize the <b>stud</b> <b>male.</b> In this condition the <b>stud</b> <b>male's</b> pheromones now block his own pregnancy. However, removal of noradrenaline after "imprint" formation at mating does not prevent recognition of the study pheromone implying that noradrenaline is required for formation, but not recall of the memory of the <b>stud</b> <b>male's</b> odour. Noradrenaline turnover in the bulbs, after alpha-methylparatyrosine injection, increases after cervical stimulation. Significantly higher rates of turnover are found at 1, 2 and 3 h, but not at 6, 12, 24 or 48 h post-stimulation. This is in accordance with our finding that the minimum time of exposure to the <b>stud</b> <b>male</b> pheromone in order for the memory to be formed lies between 3 and 4. 5 h. In those females allowed to remain with the male for 3 h post-coitus, only 30 % remain pregnant on the re-introduction to the stud the following day, whereas in females exposed for 4. 5 h, 86 % remain pregnan...|$|R

The blocks can accept reinforcement and grout after they are placed. While ICEB construction is similar to conventional masonry construction, current design code standards for masonry only partially capture the actual behavior of ICEB structures. This thesis seeks to supplement the existing masonry design procedures and tailor them for use with ICEBs. Additionally, this paper {{presents a}} preliminary design of ICEB shear walls for a disaster reconstruction project in the Philippines.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{removing}} the <b>stud</b> <b>male</b> {{have not been}} controlled in many studies relating pregnancy block {{to the presence of}} an unfamiliar male. We examined the effects of removing the male on pregnancy success in prairie voles and meadow voles, two species that differ in degree of paternal investment Whereas prairie vole males provide extensive care to oflpring and accelerate pup development, meadow vole males display little or no care and delay development of pups. We predicted that removal of the <b>stud</b> <b>male</b> would decrease pregnancy success in prairie voles and either have no effect or increase success in meadow voles. In experiment 1, females were in male-induced estrus, and their mates were either left with them or were removed 4 h, 1 day, 2 days, or 8 days after mating. In experiment 2, females were in postpartum estrus, and their mates were either left with them or were removed 1 day, 2 days, or 8 days after birth of their first litter.

Failure to form this memory results in the <b>stud</b> <b>male</b> being treated as strange, and hence, his pheromones block pregnancy.

The results show that a single prolonged exposure to the male during mating forms a life-long olfactory memory trace unless pregnancy ensues. In the event of pregnancy the olfactory memory fades significantly faster, an effect which can be replicated by implants of oestradiol in non-pregnant females.

40|$|In mice, only strange male pheromones block pregnancy; pheromones of the {{familiar}} male with which the female has mated {{have the capacity to}} block pregnancy but are ineffective with the consort female. Hence, some form of recognition/memory to the <b>stud</b> <b>male</b> is formed at mating. By infusing lignocaine locally into the accessory olfactory bulb and second order olfactory synapses in the medial nucleus of the amygdala, this study localizes changes that occur in the accessory olfactory bulb at mating to be subsequently important in preventing the <b>stud</b> <b>male's</b> pheromones from blocking pregnancy. Further attention is focused on the dendrodendritic synapses between mitral and granule cells in the accessory olfactory bulb. Blockade of the GABA receptors (granule to mitral cell synapse) in the accessory bulb without mating, but in the presence of male pheromones, prevents any male from blocking pregnancy. Conversely inhibition of protein kinase C, a second messenger system activated by excitatory amino acids (mitral to granule cell synapse), in the accessory bulb during a 4 -h period after mating permits all male pheromones including the stud's to activate pregnancy block. While blockade of protein kinase C activity during the critical exposure time for memory formation prevents memory formation, infusions of a protein synthesis inhibitor (anisomycin) are without effect. However, protein synthesis inhibition in the accessory olfactory bulb in the late phase of the critical exposure time (3 - 6 h after mating) does prevent memory formation. These studies show that changes in synaptic plasticity in the accessory olfactory bulb following mating are critical to recognition of the <b>stud</b> <b>male's</b> pheromones, hence preventing these from subsequently blocking pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|The role of urinary chemosignals {{in sexual}} {{interactions}} {{was investigated in}} pairs of adult mice. Based on previous findings, volatile molecules bound by the Major Urinary Proteins (MUPs) from adult male urine {{were thought to be}} sufficient to carry information about the sex of the emitter, and thus sufficient to modify the behaviour of conspecifics. In the first experiment, virgin and <b>stud</b> adult <b>males</b> were exposed to receptive females painted or not with MUPs-borne molecules. Both virgin and <b>stud</b> <b>males</b> showed an increased latency to the first anogenital sniff and a reduced number of sniffings towards MUPs-treated females. This suggests that adult mice are repelled by MUPs-borne volatile molecules, even in the presence of female stimuli conveyed by receptive mates. In the second experiment only <b>stud</b> <b>males</b> were tested, with ovariectomized or estrogen-primed females. These latter were either untreated, painted with MUPs-borne molecules or MUPs without volatile ligands. Ovariectomized females and those treated with MUPs without ligands received less sniffs than the other two groups. Estrogen-primed females were mounted more times, with a shorter latency. Ovariectomized females and females treated with MUPs-borne ligands were attacked earlier by males. The presence of chemical cues from male urine is thus sufficient to modify the behaviour of <b>stud</b> <b>males</b> towards receptive females. In particular, MUPs-borne volatiles are sufficient to act as male cues and to induce aggression towards receptive females. It can be speculated that in nature adult male mice rely on olfactory cues like MUPs-borne odorants to firstly identify a male conspecific and possibly use similar chemical cues from their own urine to signal their presence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Despite much {{empirical}} attention, {{tests for}} indirect benefits of mate choice have rarely considered the major components of sexual and nonsexual offspring fitness {{relevant to a}} population. Here we use a novel experimental design to test {{for the existence of}} any indirect benefits in a laboratory adapted population of D. melanogaster. Our experiment compared the fitness (mating success, longevity, and productivity) of individuals possessing genomes that derived two generations previously from males that were either entirely successful (studs) or wholly unsuccessful (duds) at achieving mates in three subsequent rounds of mating trials. Results <b>Males</b> from the <b>stud</b> treatment were 30 % more successful on average at securing mates than males from the dud treatment. In contrast, we found no difference between treatments in measures of productivity or of longevity when measured in a mixed-sex environment.

The life cycle of this blood fluke involves asexual larval reproduction in an intermediate snail host, giving rise to the infectious free-swimming cercarial form.

40|$|Published online: 21 October 2010 PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the prevalence of, and associated risk factors for, voiding and storage lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in a population-based sample of Australian men. METHODS: Data {{were collected from}} 1, 103 men randomly selected, community-dwelling men, {{as part of the}} Florey Adelaide Male Ageing Study, after exclusion of men with prostate or bladder cancer or prior surgery to either organ. The presence of LUTS was assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score. Urine flow was measured via flow meter. Demographic, clinical, and bio-psychosocial data were collected by questionnaire. RESULTS: The prevalence of total, storage, and voiding LUTS was 18. 1, 28. 0 and 12. 6 %, respectively. The most common storage symptoms were frequency (12. 3 %), nocturia (9. 9 %) and urgency (8. 1 %), and voiding symptoms were weak stream (8. 5 %), intermittency (5. 4 %), incomplete emptying (5. 1 %) and straining (2. 4 %). There were linear associations between storage LUTS and increased abdominal fat mass, plasma glucose and low HDL cholesterol (components of the metabolic syndrome), obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) risk, and retirement. Voiding symptoms were associated with a previous diagnosis of benign prostatic enlargement (BPH), mean peak urine flow, total energy intake, elevated risk of OSA, erectile dysfunction, physician-diagnosed thyroid dysfunction and higher household income. CONCLUSIONS: The close association of storage LUTS with the metabolic syndrome, and of both storage and voiding LUTS with OSA, suggest that these conditions should be considered in men presenting with LUTS.

Young males, aged between 3 and 4 weeks, failed to block pregnancy in females exposed to them alone (one male, one female); but five of the nineteen males used gave evidence of pheromone activity when examined again during the 5 th week of age; and by 9 to 10 weeks of age, when eleven of them received further tests, 79...|$|R
40|$|The {{cerebellum}} {{is generally}} considered a neural structure specialized in motor control and recent imaging data suggest its role in sexual behavior. Herein, we analyzed the pattern of Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) in the cerebellum of female rats allowed to pace copulation {{as a model of}} sexual reward in rodents. Ovariectomized, hormone-primed, sexually naïve females formed three groups: Pacing, Nonpacing and Control. Pacing occurred in arenas bisected by a middle divider that allowed only females to control sexual interaction with <b>stud</b> <b>males.</b> For nonpaced copulation the divider was removed, and control females were allowed to pace in chambers without a male. Fos-IR was analyzed in granule and Purkinje layers of the 10 cerebellar lobules, and in the fastigial deep nucleus (FDN). Results indicated that Pacing females expressed more Fos-IR in the granule layer compared to Nonpacing and Controls, and more Fos-IR in Purkinje compared to Nonpacing. No differences were observed in FDN. Such response cannot be explained with motor activity because Pacing females moved less in general. We discuss the role of the cerebellum and its connections in the sexual reward induced by pacing...|$|R
40|$|The recently-mated female mouse can {{be removed}} from her stud partner {{within a few hours}} of coitus and {{returned}} to him 24 hr later without disturbance to the pregnancy. [Outbred albino females: Bruce (1959); inbred CBA females: Godowicz (1967). ] It is only when she is exposed to another male at this time that pregnancy may be blocked. This presupposes at least partial recognition of the <b>stud</b> <b>male</b> as an individual, amounting to about 25 % for outbred albino males and about 30 % for males of an outbred Dutch strain (Parkes & Bruce, 1961). In wild house mice pregnancy rate was reduced to 16 % among recently-mated females exposed to strange males from 56 % among control females similarly disturbed but without the intervention of a strange male (Chipman & Fox, 1966). This implies an even greater variation among wild house mice. Experiments have been undertaken to investigate the possibility that such individual differences are still retained between males belonging to inbred strains. Vaginal smears were examined daily from young virgin females paired wit...|$|R
