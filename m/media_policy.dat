25|$|On March 12, 2000, 60 Minutes aired an {{interview}} with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. At the time, McVeigh had already been {{convicted and sentenced to}} death for the April 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and subsequent deaths of 168 people. On the program, McVeigh was given the opportunity to vent against the government. Following the program, a federal policy called the Special Confinement Unit <b>Media</b> <b>Policy</b> was enacted prohibiting face-to-face interviews with death row inmates. A federal inmate challenged the policy in Hammer v. Ashcroft, under which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the prison policy. In March 2010, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in the case, and the policy limiting media access to death row inmates remains in place. CBS refuses to show the entire interview, and has stated no reasons.|$|E

Goldwater's total was lower than the 80 percent that was expected. However, the result showed that Goldwater could win in a populous northern state, though a survey of newspaper publishers predicted that most of the Goldwater delegates would end up switching to the still-undecided Nixon.

Two newspapers aimed at the African-American community—The City Sun and the Amsterdam News—and the black-owned talk radio station WLIB continued to do so as the case progressed.

Through focusing on the implications of social <b>media</b> <b>policies</b> for the regulation of employees' online behaviour outside the workplace, this paper is concerned also with the purpose and scope of employment law and human resource policy, particularly in relation to employees' private lives and, by association, the scope of employees' implied contractual duties. 20 page(s...|$|R
40|$|While {{social media}} {{represents}} {{a broad range}} of benefits to organisations and institutions, such as enhanced brand engagement, it also presents challenges and risks to reputation and security, such as confidentiality breaches. Employee use of popular social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, both at work and about work has resulted in organisations developing social <b>media</b> <b>policies</b> and guidelines as part of contemporary governance practice. This paper investigates this recent approach to corporate governance by examining 20 social <b>media</b> <b>policies</b> and guidelines from a sample of corporate, government and third sector organisations that are active social media users. It develops a basic framework for social media governance based on the 13 common themes that emerge from the sample, including confidentiality, disclosure and the public-private divide of social media usage. It draws on social contract theory and considers its importance to the field of social media governance. Key implications for managers who are tasked with developing and implementing social <b>media</b> <b>policies</b> and guidelines are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The {{expanding}} use of {{both personal}} and professional social media sites has resulted in its growing impact in the workplace. Recently, many examples have emerged where an individual’s use of social media for communicating frustrations or sharing personal information resulted in significant conflict {{between the individual and}} their employer. Employment actions arising from an employee’s social media use have become so contentious that a number of employers have been charged with unfair labor practices for overly broad social <b>media</b> <b>policies</b> or implementation of unfair policies. Following several important Board decisions the NLRB issued guidelines, identifying acceptable employer-initiated social <b>media</b> <b>policies.</b> As social <b>media’s</b> popularity will likely only continue to grow, {{it is important to understand}} how employer policies impact employees’ social media use and the potential invasion these policies may have on employees’ rights. This article concludes that the NLRB’s issued guidance fails to adequately address social media concerns raised by employers and dilutes employees’ rights to communicate workplace concerns. This is because even though the guidance permits employer developed social <b>media</b> <b>policies,</b> the NLRB’s stance permits employers to monitor and analyze employees’ social media use and does not clarify when an employer can act on social media information...|$|R

40|$|The last 5 {{years have}} seen {{a growing number of}} {{universities}} use social media services such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to engage with past, present and prospective students. More recently still, a number of universities have published policy or guidance documents on the use of social media for a range of university-related purposes including learning, teaching and assessment. This study considers the social <b>media</b> <b>policies</b> of 14 universities in the United Kingdom (UK) that are currently in the public domain. It addresses some {{of the ways in which}} Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are responding to both the positive potential of social media as well as its perceived threats. Drawing inspiration, if not actual method, from critical discourse analysis, this study argues that marketisation has been the main policy driver with many social <b>media</b> <b>policies</b> being developed to promote university &#x 201 C;brands&#x 201 D; as well as protect institutional reputation. The creation and implementation of social <b>media</b> <b>policies</b> are therefore playing a role in helping universities manage both the risks and the benefits of social media in the context of an increasingly marketised Higher Education (HE) environment in which protecting institutional reputation has become a priority. However, in the defence of the metaphorical institutional &#x 201 C;share price&#x 201 D;, some policies constrain both academic autonomy and the possibilities for innovation and risk-taking...|$|R
