[...] Stephen Paul Miller believes the Pulp Fiction scene goes down much easier than the one it echoes: [...] "The buggery perpetrated is not at all as shocking as it was in Deliverance... The nineties film reduces seventies competition, horror, and taboo into an entertainingly subtle adrenaline play— a fiction, a pulp fiction." [...] Giroux reads the rape scene homage similarly: [...] "in the end Tarantino's use of parody is about repetition, transgression, and softening the face of violence by reducing it to the property of film history." [...] In Groth's view, the crucial difference is that [...] "in Deliverance the rape created the film's central moral dilemma whereas in Pulp Fiction it was merely 'the single weirdest day of [...] life.'" [...] ("American <b>Me</b> <b>did</b> it too," [...] Tarantino observed. [...] "There's like three butt-fucking scenes in American Me.

Anyway, people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to.

2500|$|The {{second level}} of {{existence}} is the ethical. This is where an individual {{begins to take}} on a true direction in life, becoming aware of and personally responsible for good and evil and forming a commitment to oneself and others. One's actions at this level of existence have a consistency and coherence that they lacked in the previous sphere of existence. For many readers of Kierkegaard, the ethical is central. It calls each individual to take account of their lives and to scrutinize their actions in terms of absolute responsibility, which is what Kierkegaard calls repentance. If we compare Kierkegaard's idea of ethics with Vedic system of four aims of life, this Ethical system probably correlates most with Dharma - following this or that religion,set of rules, laws etc. (Hindus would call any religion as [...] "dharma", though dharma is also a law). [...] "He repents himself back into himself, back into the family, back into the race, until he finds himself in God. Only on this condition can he choose himself. And this is the only condition he wants, for only in this way can he choose himself absolutely." .... “I repent myself out of the whole existence. Repentance specifically expresses that evil essentially belongs to me {{and at the same time}} expresses that it does not essentially belong to me. If the evil in <b>me</b> <b>did</b> not essentially belong to me, I could not choose it; but if there were something in me that I could not choose absolutely, then I would not be choosing myself absolutely at all, then I myself would not be the absolute but only a product." .... "It is a sign of a well brought up child to be inclined to say it is sorry without too much pondering whether it is in the right or not, and it is likewise a sign of a high-minded person and a deep soul if he is inclined to repent, if he does not take God to court but repents and loves God in his repentance. Without this, his life is nothing, only like foam." ... "The Either/Or I erected between living esthetically and living ethically is not an unqualified dilemma, because it actually is a matter of only one choice. Through this choice, I actually choose between good and evil, but I choose the good, I choose eo ipso the choice between good and evil. The original choice is forever present in every succeeding choice." [...] Søren Kierkegaard, Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216-217, 224, 237-238, 219 ...|$|E
