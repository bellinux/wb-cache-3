Burning can occur in regions that are subject to strong UV radiation, especially in lighter-skinned dogs. Many owners apply baby sunscreen to their pets before spending time in strong sun.

40|$|I {{begin by}} {{offering}} some highlighting {{certain aspects of}} Tibetan language variation with particular attention to <b>the</b> local Gyalthang <b>variety.</b> In <b>the</b> following section I introduce Gyalthang’s touristic Old Town and the language situation there, exploring how the highly divergent nature and mutual unintelligibility of Tibetan language varieties inform stakeholder language attitudes. I place Gyalthang Tibetan into the UNESCO framework for assessing language vitality to explore <b>the</b> interactions <b>of</b> these attitudes and the implications they have for <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local Tibetan <b>variety.</b> I conclude {{with a discussion of}} what language shift in Gyalthang reveals about language shift in general. <b>The</b> example <b>of</b> Gyalthang’s Old Town complicates <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> language shift in which one group succumbs to a single dominant homogenous force. What this case illustrates instead is a multilingual situation fraught with issues of socioeconomic and prestige inequalities against a backdrop of urbanization and globalization...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies of}} {{minority}} language revitalisation {{focus on the}} attitudes and perceptions of minorities, but not on those of majority group members. This paper discusses <b>the</b> implications <b>of</b> these issues, and presents research into majority andf minority attitudes towards the endangered indigenous vernacular of Guernsey, Channel Islands. The research used a multi-method approach (questionnaire and interview) to obtain attitudinal data from a representative sample <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population that included politicians and civil servants (209 participants). The findings suggested a shift in language ideology away from the post-second world war ‘culture of modernisation’ and monolingual ideal, towards recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> a bi/trilingual linguistic heritage. Public opinion in Guernsey now seems to support <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indigenous language <b>variety,</b> {{which has led to}} a degree <b>of</b> official support. <b>The</b> paper then discusses to what extent this ‘attitude shift’ is reflected in linguistic behaviour and in concrete language planning measures...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{in depth}} three {{case studies of}} {{families}} of Greek Cypriot origin, bringing up their children in London. Each family consists of three generations: grandparents, parents and children. My aim is to explain why, although the families have similar ethnic and linguistic backgrounds, their children have very different outcomes in terms <b>of</b> language <b>maintenance</b> or shift. My interest in this question arose through my role as teacher in the Greek community language school that all the children attend. I use a qualitative case study approach to explore <b>the</b> linguistic lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants through semi-structured individual interviews with grandparents, parents and children. My study appreciates the complexity and uniqueness of each family and <b>the</b> journey <b>of</b> their languages over the years. I reveal <b>the</b> linguistic experiences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first generation before and after they migrated from Cyprus to England, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second and third generations who were born {{and grew up in}} London. I analyse the factors which informed their choices with respect to abandoning their heritage code, or reviving or reinforcing it. Included in my analysis is <b>the</b> important effect <b>of</b> language ideologies on family language policies, made particularly complex by the participants’ diglossic background in which Standard Modern Greek holds more social and political power than the Cypriot dialect. Through <b>the</b> in-depth analysis <b>of</b> my participants’ accounts, <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> ‘family language history’ emerges as an explanatory tool. This concept involves the inter-relationship between language ideologies as they are created and contested within particular socio-political circumstances, and the decisions taken by each generation about which code should be used in specific contexts within the family and the wider society. I draw on Bourdieu’s theoretical ideas about symbolic domination and <b>the</b> convertibility <b>of</b> linguistic capital into other forms <b>of</b> capital, and <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> counter-hegemony, to explain how my participants negotiate <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> their heritage language in an English-dominant society...|$|R
