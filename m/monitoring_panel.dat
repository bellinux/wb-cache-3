25|$|Kwan {{looked at}} the 2005 Worlds as a {{learning}} experience in the ISU Judging System. She continued to train and stated that she would attempt {{to qualify for the}} 2006 Olympic Games in Turin, Italy. However, following a hip injury, she was forced to withdraw from her three planned competitions in the fall of 2005. Kwan skated her new short program ("Totentanz") at a made-for-TV event in December 2005, but her performance was well below her usual standard. On January 4, 2006, Kwan withdrew from the U.S. Figure Skating Championships with an abdominal injury incurred in December 2005. One week later, she filed a petition with the USFSA for a medical waiver to be placed on the 2006 Olympic figure skating team. On January 14, 2006, after the United States ladies' figure skating event, the USFSA's International Committee met and in a 20 to 3 vote approved Kwan's petition under the stipulation that she show her physical and competitive readiness to a five-member <b>monitoring</b> <b>panel</b> by January 27.|$|E

50|$|The TN {{method was}} the only viable {{technology}} for active matrix TFT LCDs in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Early panels showed grayscale inversion from up to down, and had a high response time (for this kind of transition, 1ms is visually better than 5ms). In the mid-1990s new technologies were developed—typically IPS and Vertical Alignment (VA)—that could resolve these weaknesses and were applied to large computer <b>monitor</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R

It consists of 16 panels mounted at angles from 0 to 70 degrees, with two each at increments of 10 degrees. By <b>monitoring</b> <b>panel</b> output, solar influx, snow fall and meteorological factors a loss due to snowfall can be determined for a general system at a variety of angles. In addition, thermal panel measurements lead {{to a better understanding of}} snow shedding mechanisms.

40|$|In sensory {{analysis}} {{a panel of}} trained assessors evaluates a set of samples according to specific sensory descriptors. The training improves objectivity and reliability of assessments. However, there can be individual differences between assessors left after the training that {{should be taken into}} account in the analysis. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>panel</b> performance is then crucial for optimal sensory evaluations. The quality of the results is strongly dependent on the performance of each assessor and of the panel as a whole. The present work proposes to analyze the panel performance within single sensory evaluations and between consecutive evaluations. The basic idea is to use multi-way models to handle the three-way nature of the sensory data. Specifically, a PARAFAC model is used to investigate the panel performance in the single experiment. N-PLS model is used to test the predictive ability of the panel on each experiment. A PARAFAC model is also used for <b>monitoring</b> <b>panel</b> performance over different experiments...|$|E
30|$|If one hypothesizes that {{persisting}} long-term immune alterations may {{participate in}} {{increased risk for}} additional infections in septic patients, the present results are somehow unexpected. As opposed to mHLA-DR results, CD 4 + T cells results and Treg results, the main result observed in the study reported by Arens et al. [35] is the ex vivo decreased whole blood cytokine secretion in long-term survivors. This is the confirmation that a single marker is likely to {{not be sufficient to}} fully monitor patient immune status. In addition, it supports the need to include functional testing in an immune <b>monitoring</b> <b>panel</b> which could detect some persistent immune alterations; additional research is needed to improve our understanding of long-term mortality in septic patients.|$|E

40|$|Summary: It {{was aimed}} to search {{to be able}} to {{forecast}} the crises which arise from demand fluctuations, and to able to generate a systematic and dynamic process in the hotel businesses. In the quantitative period, forecasting was realized to 149 monthly series of a five star hotel in Ankara via MA, Simple, Holt's, Winter's Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA. The results of these methods were compared by some error measures. At the other side of integration, two Delphi based inquiry panels were realized: The Variables Determination Panel and The Environmental <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Panel.</b> The opinions of second group panelists were used to adjust Winter's Multiplicative forecasts via AHP based approach. This process shows that, if the forecasting and adjustment process is applied to hotels monthly, it will be useful for crises arised from demand fluctuations in hotelbusiness. The most important characteristic of model is being elasticity for change and development...|$|E
40|$|Few {{questions}} {{in political science}} have received more attention in recent times than the role of trust in democracy, democratic government and political participation. In Britain {{this has become a}} particular concern as levels of democratic engagement in traditional politics have declined, exacerbated by media reports of politicians' untrustworthy behaviour. A common feature of previous empirical work on political trust is that trust is treated as a single theoretical concept. Scholars have assumed that trust operates in a similar fashion across different political institutions—that citizens' trust mechanisms are the same for trusting parliament, the prime minister or the European Union. As a consequence, the operationalisation of trust has generally been through a single measure. In this article we draw on recent research from political theory, where different forms of judgements whether to trust—strategic, moral and deliberative—have been conceptualised, to argue that trust judgements may vary in application and significance depending upon the institution under examination. Using specially designed data sets generated from YouGov's weekly omnibus and the British Election Study's Continuous <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Panel,</b> we operationalise these three forms of trust judgements to examine trust in two British institutions—political parties and politicians. We find, as hypothesised, that different forms of trust judgements are of differing significance depending upon the institution under consideration...|$|E
40|$|We {{report in}} this paper the {{development}} of a real-time software system for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) helicopter, which consists of an embedded computer onboard and a ground station served by a laptop. The software system for the onboard computer performs multiple tasks including data acquisition and measurement, servo driving, automatic flight control implementation, communications and data logging. The system for the ground station gives a flexible graphical interface monitoring the real-time status of the UAV helicopter. We present the frameworks and structures of the onboard and ground station systems. The onboard system employs a framework of multiple task threads with each thread being assigned to perform a specific task. Management and time scheduling for task threads together with the detailed implementation of automatic flight control laws are the main focuses of the onboard software system. A behavior-based architecture is designed to address task scheduling and event disposal for automatic control. A hierarchical and componential structure is developed to integrate multiple control laws and perform various helicopter behaviors. The ground station software system employs a two-layer framework, i. e., data transferring in background and data visualization in foreground. A variety of views are developed to display in-flight data received from the UAV helicopter in different forms including a 3 D <b>monitoring</b> <b>panel,</b> which displays real-time data in 3 D on the ground station.
