5|$|Fat Freddy's Drop {{returned}} to touring New Zealand, Australia and Europe {{to promote the}} new album in 2009. Three shows {{on the west coast}} of the United States, and a show in Canada, were also included in the tour. The only previous time the band had played in the United States was a single performance at the Detroit Electronic Music festival in 2004. Before 2009, the cost of touring in the US, difficulty obtaining visas, and the band's low profile in North America prevented them from including tour dates there. Band <b>members</b> <b>say</b> they now consider playing together as Fat Freddy's Drop their first musical priority, and spend less time playing with other bands.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} {{to build the}} infrastructure necessary to support electric vehicles {{is illustrated by the}} decision of Car2Go in San Diego, California, that due to insufficient charging infrastructure decided to replace all of its all-electric car fleet with gasoline-powered cars starting on 1 May 2016. When the carsharing service started in 2011, Car2Go expected 1,000 charging stations to be deployed around the city, but only 400 were in place by early 2016. As a result, an average of 20% of the carsharing fleet is unavailable at any given time because the cars are either being charged or because they don’t have enough electricity in them to be driven. Also, many of the company’s 40,000 San Diego <b>members</b> <b>say</b> they often worry their Car2Go will run out of charge before they finish their trip.|$|E

Lee states to Peter (Joshua Jackson) {{that he will be}} staying in the parallel universe, where he feels at home, reflecting a previous conversation Peter had with Lee about staying with Olivia in the prime universe. Walter and Walternate have a heartfelt discussion over Peter, and Walter expresses concern that if the bridge disappears, so will Peter. The other Fringe <b>members</b> <b>say</b> their goodbyes to their counterparts. Eventually, the Machine is overloaded and deactivated, and the parallel universe aspects of the room disappear; Walter is pleased to see Peter remains.|$|E

500|$|Faiumu {{and other}} band <b>members</b> <b>say</b> their biggest {{influence}} is {{their home country}} of New Zealand, and their peers in Wellington's [...] "small-but-solid" [...] music scene—Wellington's population was less than 180,000 in 2007. They feel their music [...] "belong here in New Zealand, you can tell it came from this country." [...] Fat Freddy's Drop's music has been categorised as Aotearoa roots music—meaning contemporary music inspired by Māori and Pacific Islander culture, {{even though they are}} a mixed-race group. Faiumu is a first-generation Samoan-New Zealander, Tamaira, Gordon and Kerr are native Māori, and the remaining members are descended from European immigrants.|$|E
500|$|Describing the band, National Public Radio host Guy Raz said, [...] "Take the swagger of Jamaican dub, {{throw in}} a little Memphis soul and send it halfway down the globe, and what comes back? The band Fat Freddy's Drop." [...] The band has been {{categorised}} under many genres, and <b>members</b> <b>say</b> many of those genres helped shape their musical style: delta blues, jazz, dub, soul, techno, and contemporary rhythm and blues. Musical styles heard while on tour have also shaped their sound; Dr Boondigga and the Big BW was influenced by contemporary German, Portuguese, and Bhangra music while touring {{in the years before}} its release.|$|E

Fortuny says that, [...] "...wearing long skirts does not negate {{the meaning of}} being a woman and, although it underlines the difference between men and women, [...] say {{that it does not}} make them feel like inferior human beings". Fortuny says women describe their attire as part of obeying biblical commands found in 1 Timothy 2:9, and 1 Corinthians 11:15 for long hair. Female <b>members</b> <b>say</b> the Church's dress code makes them feel they are honoring God and that it is part of their [...] "essence".|$|E

At {{the time of the}} security breach, Microsoft was in the development stage for its next-generation gaming system. Between 2011 and 2013, the hackers spent hundreds of hours searching through Microsoft's network copying log-in credentials, source code, technical specifications and other data. Group <b>members</b> <b>say</b> they were driven by an immense curiosity about Microsoft's then-unreleased Xbox One console and associated software.

2500|$|While {{the church}} takes an apolitical {{approach}} to candidates, it encourages {{its members to}} {{play an active role}} as responsible citizens in their communities, including becoming informed about issues and voting in elections. It actively works to counter anti-Mormonism that may come up during political campaigns. A 2012 Pew Center on Religion and Public Life survey indicates that 74 percent of U.S. members lean towards the Republican Party. Some liberal <b>members</b> <b>say</b> they feel that they have to defend their worthiness due to political differences.

2500|$|The Church of Scientology {{has been}} criticized for their {{practice}} of [...] "disconnection" [...] in which Scientologists are directed to sever all contact with family members or friends who criticize the faith. Critics including ex-members and relatives of existing <b>members</b> <b>say</b> that this practice has divided many families. The disconnection policy is considered by critics to be further evidence that the Church is a cult. By making its members entirely dependent upon a social network entirely within the organization, critics assert that Scientologists are kept from exposure to critical perspectives on the church and are put in a situation that makes it extremely difficult for members to leave the church, since apostates will be shunned by the Church and have already been cut off from family and friends.|$|E

[...] Increasing those levels was not considered in depth as it was not considered a viable option. Panel <b>members</b> <b>say</b> they were not given a mandate to consider increasing the number of American troops in Iraq because their military briefers dismissed out of hand the premise {{that it was possible to}} increase the number of American troops in Iraq, on grounds that not enough were available. The report recommends instead envisaging the removal of all U.S. troops from Iraq by 2008.|$|E
