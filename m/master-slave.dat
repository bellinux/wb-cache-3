5|$|The {{mechanism}} may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's {{climate system}} {{may have a}} natural resonance frequency of 100ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch. Opponents to this claim {{point out that the}} resonance would have to have developed 1 million years ago, as a 100ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2million years. This is feasible—continental drift and sea floor spreading rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change. Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause, but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse. The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann who find that <b>master-slave</b> synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100 ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.|$|E

25|$|Levitt, Moser, & Jamison's 1994 study {{provides}} a general, if outdated, {{description of characteristics}} {{of women in the}} sadomasochistic (S/M) subculture. They state that women in S/M tend to have higher education, become more aware of their desires as a young adult, {{are less likely to be}} married than the general population. The researchers found the majority of females identified as heterosexual and submissive, a substantial minority were versatile—able to switch between dominant and submissive roles—and a smaller minority identified with the dominant role exclusively. Oral sex, bondage and <b>master-slave</b> script were among the most popular activities, while feces/watersports were the least popular.|$|E
25|$|Another {{representative}} study, {{published in}} 1999 by the German Institut für rationale Psychologie, found that about 2/3 of the interviewed women stated {{a desire to}} be at the mercy of their sexual partners from time to time. 69% admitted to fantasies dealing with sexual submissiveness, 42% stated interest in explicit BDSM techniques, 25% in bondage. A 1976 study in the general US population suggests three percent have had positive experiences with Bondage or <b>master-slave</b> roleplaying. Overall 12% of the interviewed females and 18% of the males were willing to try it. A 1990 Kinsey Institute report stated that 5% to 10% of Americans occasionally engage in sexual activities related to BDSM. 11% of men and 17% of women reported trying bondage. Some elements of BDSM have been popularized through increased media coverage since the middle 1990s. Thus both black leather clothing, sexual jewellery such as chains and dominance roleplay appear increasingly outside of BDSM contexts.|$|E
25|$|At that point, {{measurement}} starts. The operator {{switches to}} sweep speed 5, which returns to a display with two separated traces, with the signals inverted and running {{at a lower}} sweep speed so that multiple repetitions of the signal appear on the traces. Mixed into the signal is an electronic scale produced in a time base generator, causing {{a series of small}} pips to appear over the now-inverted original signals. At the 5 setting, the pips on the scale represent differences of 10 microseconds, and the operator measures the distance between positions. This is repeated for setting 6 at 50 microseconds, and again at setting 7 at 500 microseconds. The difference as measured at each of these settings is then added up to produce the total delay between the two signals. This entire procedure was then repeated for the second <b>master-slave</b> set, often the second set of the same chain but not always.|$|E
500|$|The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South is a {{book written}} by American {{historian}} John W. Blassingame. Published in 1972, {{it is one of}} the first historical studies of slavery in the United States to be presented from the perspective of the enslaved. The Slave Community contradicted those historians who had interpreted history to suggest that African American slaves were docile and submissive [...] "Sambos" [...] who enjoyed the benefits of a paternalistic <b>master-slave</b> relationship on southern plantations. Using psychology, Blassingame analyzes fugitive slave narratives published in the 19th century to conclude that an independent culture developed among the enslaved and that there were a variety of personality types exhibited by slaves.|$|E
500|$|Shortly thereafter, Information Minister Ahmad Shabery Cheek {{insisted that}} ketuanan Melayu did not imply a <b>master-slave</b> {{relationship}} {{in any sense}} between the Malays and non-Malays. Instead, he suggested, it referred to {{the institution of the}} Malay monarchs, who had once been the [...] "masters", but gave up their primacy when the Federal Constitution was adopted at independence. Shabery cited Article 182 of the Constitution, which grants the royalty certain legal immunities, as an example of Malay supremacy. However, some prominent members of the royalty such as the Raja of Perlis and former Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Putra Syed Jamalullail have themselves been critical of ketuanan Melayu; in early 2009, the Raja stated that [...] "In Malaysia, every race is tuan ... I believe that if everyone understands that every individual of any race, should not be deprived of their rights, then the efforts of certain parties who think that the supremacy or rights should only be given to a particular race can be stopped." ...|$|E

2500|$|The new supreme rulers {{disposed}} {{of the legal}} fiction of the early Empire (seeing the emperor as but the first among equals); emperors from Aurelian (reigned 270–275) onwards openly styled themselves as dominus et deus, [...] "lord and god", titles appropriate for a <b>master-slave</b> relationship. An elaborate court ceremonial developed, and obsequious flattery became {{the order of the}} day. Under Diocletian, the flow of direct requests to the emperor rapidly reduced and soon ceased altogether. No other form of direct access replaced them, and the emperor received only information filtered through his courtiers.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of Gee, signals were direct from the {{transmitter}} to receiver, producing a clean signal that was easy to interpret. If displayed on a single CRT trace, the operator would see a string of sharp [...] "blips", first the master, {{then one of the}} slaves, the master again, and then the other slave. Gee CRTs were built to be able to display two traces, and by tuning several delay circuits, the operator could make the first <b>master-slave</b> signal appear on the upper display and the second on the lower. They could then take a measurement of both at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|The stereotypical role of wifedom {{has also}} been {{explored}} through use of gynoids. In The Stepford Wives, husbands are shown as desiring to restrict the independence of their wives, and obedient and stereotypical spouses are preferred. The husbands' technological method of obtaining this [...] "perfect wife" [...] is through the murder of their human wives and replacement with gynoid substitutes that are compliant and housework obsessed, resulting in a [...] "picture-postcard" [...] perfect suburban society. This {{has been seen as}} an allegory of male chauvinism of the period, by representing marriage as a <b>master-slave</b> relationship, and an attempt at raising feminist consciousness during the era of second wave feminism.|$|E
2500|$|Martial and {{his friend}} Juvenal {{suffered}} the system as clients for years, and found the whole business demeaning. A client must be at his patron's beck and call, to perform whatever [...] "togate works" [...] were required; and the patron might even expect to be addressed as [...] "domine" [...] (lord, or master); a citizen-client of the equestrian class, superior to all lesser mortals by virtue of rank and costume, might thus approach the shameful condition of dependent servitude. For a client whose patron was another's client, the potential for shame was still worse. Even as a satirical analogy, the equation of togate client and slave would have shocked those who cherished the toga {{as a symbol of}} personal dignity and auctoritas – a meaning underlined during the Saturnalia festival, when the toga was [...] "very consciously put aside", in a ritualised, strictly limited inversion of the <b>master-slave</b> relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Hegel's {{principal}} {{achievement is}} his {{development of a}} distinctive articulation of idealism sometimes termed [...] "absolute idealism", in which the dualisms of, for instance, mind and nature and subject and object are overcome. His philosophy of spirit conceptually integrates psychology, the state, history, art, religion, and philosophy. His account of the <b>master–slave</b> dialectic has been highly influential, especially in 20th-century France. Of special importance is his concept of spirit (Geist: sometimes also translated as [...] "mind") as the historical manifestation of the logical concept and the [...] "sublation" [...] (Aufhebung: integration without elimination or reduction) of seemingly contradictory or opposing factors; examples include the apparent opposition between nature and freedom and between immanence and transcendence. Hegel has {{been seen in the}} 20th century as the originator of the thesis, antithesis, synthesis triad; [...] however, as an explicit phrase, it originated with Johann Gottlieb Fichte.|$|E
2500|$|... "St Thomas Aquinas in mid-thirteenth century {{accepted}} the new Aristotelian view of slavery {{as well as}} the titles of slave ownership derived from Roman civil law, and attempted - without complete success - to reconcile them with Christian patristic tradition. He takes the patristic theme... that slavery exists is a consequence of original sin and says that it exists according to the [...] "second intention" [...] of nature; it would not have existed in the state of original innocence according to the [...] "first intention" [...] of nature; in this way he can explain the Aristotelian teaching that some people are slaves [...] "by nature" [...] like inanimate instruments, because of their personal sins; for since the slave cannot work for his own benefit slavery is necessarily a punishment. He accepts the symbiotic <b>master-slave</b> relationship as being mutually beneficial. There should be no punishment without some crime, so slavery as a penalty is a matter of positive law. St Thomas' explanation continued to be expounded at least {{until the end of the}} 18th century." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nietzsche's {{body of work}} touched widely on art, philology, history, religion, tragedy, culture, and science, {{and drew}} early {{inspiration}} from figures such as Schopenhauer, Wagner, and Goethe. [...] His writing spans philosophical polemics, poetry, cultural criticism, and fiction while displaying a fondness for aphorism and irony. Some prominent elements of his philosophy include his radical critique of truth in favor of perspectivism; his genealogical critique of religion and Christian morality, and his related theory of <b>master–slave</b> morality; his aesthetic affirmation of existence {{in response to the}} [...] "death of God" [...] and the profound crisis of nihilism; his notion of the Apollonian and Dionysian; and his characterization of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, collectively understood as the will to power. In his later work, he developed influential concepts such as the [...] and the doctrine of eternal return, and became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual to overcome social, cultural, and moral contexts in pursuit of new values and aesthetic health.|$|E

In 1949 Goertz filed a patent for a mechanical, bilateral <b>master-slave</b> manipulator, and in 1951 Goertz improved upon this design with the first tel-operated articulated arm with a design that relied on mechanical coupling between the master and slave arms through the utilization of steel pulleys and cables.
