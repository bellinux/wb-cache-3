2500|$|The WTO's dispute-settlement system [...] "is {{the result}} of the {{evolution}} of rules, procedures and practices developed over almost half a century under the GATT 1947". In 1994, the WTO members agreed on the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) annexed to the [...] "Final Act" [...] signed in Marrakesh in 1994. Dispute settlement is regarded by the WTO as the central pillar of the <b>multilateral</b> <b>trading</b> <b>system,</b> and as a [...] "unique contribution to the stability of the global economy". WTO members have agreed that, if they believe fellow-members are violating trade rules, they will use the multilateral system of settling disputes instead of taking action unilaterally.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} task the WTO faces {{in pursuit of}} universality is the integration of nonmembers. Yet, becoming {{a member of the}} <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>system</b> is not easy. Accession to the WTO is a complicated and cumbersome process, which on average takes 10 years to complete. For a small state the task of joining the WTO is further protracted because its size poses certain development challenges when acquiring membership. Yet, accession for small states has not always been problematic. Accession jnder the GATT was far easier but under the WTO, accession ha come much more difficult. This thesis explores how accesion for a particular set of small states has changed through time, which it does by examining the Caribbean region. It examines how Caribbean states have joined the <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>system</b> and explores how changes in the accession process have shaped their accession experiences. The Caribbean makes an apposite case study, as not only does the region have a state, the Bahamas, currently in the queue to join the WTO, but it also has a number of states that have been members of ihe GATT/WTO for a long time, therefore permitting for research to tease out if the tuning of accession has an impact upon their accession experience. The thesis also examines whether the issue of smallness shapes accession and subsequent membership. In other words, the thesis explores whether institutional asymmetry affects the Caribbean states disproportionately because of the specificities of their political economies. It develops its argument by exploring the creation and evolution of the <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>system</b> with a key focus on aspects, which have had an impact upon accession. By utilising the conceptual framework of historical institutionalism the thesis argues Caribbean accession is shaped by {{the manner in which the}} <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>system</b> was created and evolved.

The General Agreement on Trade in Services was created to extend the <b>multilateral</b> <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> to service sector, in the same way as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) provided such a system for merchandise trade. The agreement entered into force in January 1995. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights sets down minimum standards for many forms of intellectual property (IP) regulation. It was negotiated at the end of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1994.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the socialist states' {{participation}} in world <b>trade</b> <b>systems</b> was to expand trade with Western countries by elimination of discriminatory treatment imposed by the West. Although China is an original member of GATT, the new government {{had not been able}} to participate in GATT activities and had been kept away from the <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>system</b> ever since its inception. It had been subject to the constraints of a special Western trade control policy, which facilitated the formation of the highly centralized economic system in China. There are six socialist member states in GATT. They are Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, Hungary and Cuba. Since 1980 China has been considering the pros and cons of GATT membership. Although China is an original member of GATT, the new government of the PRC has not participated in GATT activities for thirty years. By seeking GATT membership, China hopes to eliminate various kinds of discriminatory quantitative restrictions, to enjoy the MFN treatment of GATT to play a major role in world trade, to learn how to do business in <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>system</b> and to protect its interest through GATT systems.
