The fuselage was relatively large, requiring several measurement locations to analyze the intensity flow through the whole of the structure. For the measurement of structural intensity, the use <b>of</b> a <b>transducer</b> array was necessary at every location of interest. A trade-off was therefore required between the number <b>of</b> measurement <b>transducers,</b> the <b>mounting</b> <b>of</b> these <b>transducers,</b> and the accuracy of the measurements. Using four accelerometers mounted on a bakelite platform, structural intensity vectors were measured at locations distributed throughout the fuselage.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{technique is}} {{used to measure the}} structural power flow through an aircraft fuselage with the excitation near the wing attachment location. Because of the large number of measurements required to analyze the whole of an aircraft fuselage, it is necessary that a balance be achieved between the number <b>of</b> measurement <b>transducers,</b> the <b>mounting</b> <b>of</b> these <b>transducers,</b> and the accuracy of the measurements. Using four transducers mounted on a bakelite platform, the structural intensity vectors at locations distributed throughout the fuselage are measured. To minimize the errors associated with using a four transducers technique the measurement positions are selected away from bulkheads and stiffeners. Because four separate transducers are used, with each transducer having its own drive and conditioning amplifiers, phase errors are introduced in the measurements that can be much greater than the phase differences associated with the measurements. To minimize these phase errors two sets of measurements are taken for each position with the orientation <b>of</b> the <b>transducers</b> rotated by 180 deg and an average taken between the two sets of measurements.

40|$|The MiniGRAIL {{detector}} was improved. The sphere {{was replaced}} by a slightly larger one, having a diameter of 68 cm (instead of 65 cm), reducing the resonant frequency by about 200 Hz to around 2. 9 kHz. The last four masses of the attenuation system were machined to increase their resonant frequency and improve the attenuation around the resonant frequency of the sphere. In the new sphere, six holes were machined on the TIGA positions for easy <b>mounting</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transducers.</b> During the last cryogenic run, two capacitive transducers and a calibrator were mounted on the sphere. The first transducer was coupled to a double-stage SQUID amplifier having a commercial quantum design SQUID as a first stage and a DROS as a second stage. The second transducer was read by a single-stage quantum design SQUID. During the cryogenic run, the sphere was cooled down to 4 K. The two-stage SQUID had a flux noise of about 1. 6 μ 0 Hz− 1 / 2.

40|$|The {{development}} of new Non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM) concepts initiated the development and application of new types <b>of</b> sensors and <b>transducers.</b> So, for structural health monitoring with guided elastic waves a variety <b>of</b> piezoelectric <b>transducers</b> were proposed. Examples are disc, foil and fiber transducers. A reliable characterization <b>of</b> these <b>transducers</b> in its various application conditions is necessary, because the transducer performance will depend {{on a number of}} factors. Among them are the way <b>of</b> <b>mounting</b> the <b>transducer</b> (e. g. attached or embedded), the type and thickness of a glue layer and also the structure the transducers are mounted to. Analytical and numerical modeling <b>of</b> the <b>transducer</b> behavior is helpful for characterizing the transducer's behavior, but has also its limitations. Within this paper a basic application of the reciprocity relation exerted to surface waves was demonstrated. Based on a well-designed experiment and carefully consideration of proper chosen input signals a good agreement between measurements and reciprocity related derivations can be achieved. The incorporation of laser-vibrometry enables new possibilities for characterizing sensors and actors used in NDT and SHM systems. Besides the evaluation of the valid scope of the presented relation it is also possible to characterize a transducer's sensitivity and its angular dependencies. Further studies will concentrate on the magnitudes of the determined signals to complete the model. Summing up and as shown in figure 6, reciprocity applied to surface waves is feasible and benefits a SHM sensor system's design...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the second}} of two {{companion}} papers concerned with the active control of structural vibration transmission. Five different active control strategies have been studied for the reduction of structural power transmission from a source to a receiver via a number <b>of</b> active <b>mounts.</b> The effects <b>of</b> <b>transducer</b> errors and the problems created {{by the presence of}} an uncontrolled flanking excitation acting on the receiver have been analyzed. Minimization of the total power transmitted to the receiver through the mounts has been compared with more practical control strategies at the junctions connecting the mounts to the plate: the cancellation of out-of-plane velocities, the cancellation of out-of-plane forces, the cancellation of the power due only to the out-of-plane velocities and forces and the minimization of the sum of squared out-of-plane velocities and weighted square forces. The control of total power gives the best results under ideal conditions but, for realistic cases, characterized by measurement errors and flanking paths, the cancellation of velocity or force is more effective than the active control of measured power. The minimization of the sum of squared velocities and weighted squared forces gives a particularly interesting result since the performance of the active control system is then almost {{the same as that of}} minimizing total power and this performance is not sensitive to measurement errors or flanking paths...|$|R

5000|$|SAAMI {{pressure}} testing protocol uses a conformal Piezoelectric Quartz Transducer for {{pressure testing}} of centerfire pistol and revolver, centerfire rifle, and rimfire cartridges. The primary source <b>of</b> the conformal <b>transducers</b> is the US company PCB Piezotronics. The SAAMI pressure testing protocol uses test barrels {{that have a}} hole located in the chamber at a location specific to the cartridge. The SAAMI conformal transducer is fitted into a hole that penetrates the test barrel chamber {{in such a way}} that the transducer's face, precision machined to match curvature of the chamber wall at the mounting location a specific distance from the breech face, functions as part of the chamber wall. When the cartridge is fired the gas pressure causes the cartridge case to expand, contacting the chamber walls. The portion of the cartridge case in contact with the face <b>of</b> the conformal <b>transducer</b> exerts a pressure on the transducer which in turn generates a minute electronic impulse that is amplified and results in a reading in pounds per square inch (psi). The SAAMI conformal transducer has the benefit of not requiring a drilled cartridge case and the corresponding challenges of inserting and alignment required of drilled cartridge case. Instead it requires a simple pressure test of a sample case from the lot of cartridge cases being used in the test ammunition. This pressure test determines the gas pressure required to cause the case to expand and come in contact with the face <b>of</b> the conformal <b>transducer</b> upon firing. This measurement is referred to as the [...] "offset" [...] and makes allowance for the [...] "loss" [...] of that gas pressure prior to the cartridge case coming in contact with the transducer and generating the impulse. The offset is added to the pressure reading to arrive at the peak pressure reading. Other benefits of the SAAMI conformal transducer are: very adaptive to the high volume quality control testing demands of commercial and law enforcement ammunition production; protection <b>of</b> the <b>transducer</b> from direct exposure to the high temperature combustion gases and hence a comparatively long service life; [...] maximum working pressure. Cartridges with the same chamber wall diameter at the <b>mounting</b> point <b>of</b> the <b>transducer</b> and which operate within specific chamber pressure limits may use the same transducer interchangeably reducing instrumentation costs.|$|R
