40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we study the chaotic {{representation}} property for certain families of square integrable <b>martingales.</b> For this purpose, we introduce {{the notion of}} compensated-covariation stability of such families. The chaotic representation property will be defined using iterated integrals {{with respect to a}} given family of square integrable <b>martingales</b> having deterministic mutual predictable covariation. The main result of the present paper is: If X is a compensated-covariation stable family of square integrable <b>martingales</b> such that 〈X,Y〉 is deterministic for all X,Y∈X and, furthermore, the system of monomials generated by X is total in L^ 2 (Ω,F^X_T,P), then X possesses the chaotic representation property.

Relative to the filtration generated by a Lévy process, we construct families of <b>martingales</b> which possess the chaotic representation property. As an illustration of the general results, we will also discuss applications to continuous Gaussian families of <b>martingales</b> and independent families of compensated Poisson processes. We conclude the paper by giving, for the case of Lévy processes, several examples of concrete families X of <b>martingales</b> including Teugels <b>martingales...</b>|$|R
