40|$|This paper quantifies how {{variation}} in economic activity and inflation in the United States influences the market prices of level, slope, and curvature risks in Treasury markets. We develop a novel arbitrage-free dynamic term structure {{model in which}} bond investment decisions are influenced by output and inflation risks that are un-spanned by (imperfectly correlated with) information about {{the shape of the}} yield curve. Our model reveals that, between 1985 and 2007, these risks accounted for {{a large portion of the}} {{variation in}} forward terms premiums, and there was pronounced cyclical variation in the market prices of level and slope risks. A POWERFUL IMPLICATION of virtually all macro-finance affine term structure models (MTSMs) —reduced-form and equilibrium alike—is that the macro fac-tors that determine bond prices are fully spanned by the current yield curve. 1 That is, the affine mapping between <b>bond</b> <b>yields</b> and the risks in the macroe-conomy in these models can be inverted to express these risk factors as lin-ear combinations of yields. This theoretical macro-spanning condition implies strong and often counterfactual restrictions on the joint distribution <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> <b>yields</b> and the macroeconomy, as well as on how macroeconomic shocks affect term premiums.
