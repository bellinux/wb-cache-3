50|$|Graham's law is most {{accurate}} for <b>molecular</b> <b>effusion</b> which involves {{the movement of}} one gas at a time through a hole. It is only approximate for diffusion of one gas in another or in air, as these processes involve the movement {{of more than one}} gas.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{development of}} a set of analytic point source transient free molecule equations generated to model behavior ranging from <b>molecular</b> <b>effusion</b> to rocket plumes. A brief review of model performance for step function mass expulsion will be followed by presentation of physical extensions to include the effects of an ellipsoidal molecular distribution to account for certain types of thermal nonequilibrium, and response to sources described by pulse as well as step function behavior...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{highlights of}} an ongoing validation effort conducted to assess the viability of applying a set of analytic point source transient free molecule equations to model behavior ranging from <b>molecular</b> <b>effusion</b> to rocket plumes. The validation effort includes encouraging comparisons to both steady and transient studies involving experimental data and direct simulation Monte Carlo results. Finally, this model is applied to describe features of two exotic transient scenarios involving NASA Goddard Space Flight Center satellite programs...|$|E
40|$|The stable carbon isotopic {{composition}} of CH 4 {{is used to}} study the processes that affect it during transport through plants from sediment to the atmosphere. The enhancement of CH 4 flux from Cladium and Eleocharis over the flux from open water or clipped sites indicated that these plants served as gas conduits between the sediments and the atmosphere. Lowering of the water table below the sediment surface caused an Everglades sawgrass marsh to shift from emission of CH 4 to consumption of atmospheric CH 4. Cladium transported gases passively mainly via <b>molecular</b> diffusion and/or <b>effusion</b> instead of actively via bulk flow. Stable isotropic data gave no evidence that CH 4 oxidation was occurring in the rhizosphere of Cladium. Both CH 4 stable carbon isotope and flux data indicated a lack of CH 4 oxidation at the sediment-water interface in Everglades marl soils and its presence in peat soils where 40 to 92 percent of the flux across the sediment-water interface was oxidized...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{evolution}} {{experiments have}} been performed on hydrogenated carbon nitride samples in order to study the thermal stability of such samples and to investigate the presence of molecular nitrogen within the samples. The films were deposited {{by a combination of}} nitrogen and acetylene as precursor gases using an electron cyclotron wave resonance source. The results show for the release of <b>molecular</b> hydrogen broad <b>effusion</b> transients extending from approximately 300 to 900 T. In addition to H, and hydrocarbons CxHy usually observed for hydrogenated carbon films, there is a significant release of HCN molecules. This effusion also sets in at temperatures near 300 degreesC and shows a broad maximum near 700 degreesC. Above approximately 500 degreesC, for most of the samples the evolution of nitrogen rises steadily with increasing temperature, i. e. the effusion maximum is at temperatures exceeding the temperature range (100 - 1050 degreesC) investigated. However, in the nitrogen content range from 15 at. % to approximately 25 at. %, a peak near 300 degreesC is also observed. It becomes less pronounced at higher nitrogen content. This peak is probably a consequence of molecular nitrogen that is included in the sample without bonding, in (isolated) voids or bubbles. The implications for film properties, composition and thermal stability are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} novel and {{reliable}} process to prepare ultra-thin parylene film {{based on a}} principle combining both <b>molecular</b> <b>effusion</b> and diffusion. For the first time, a technique for the deposition of parylene film thinner than 20 nm in a highly controllable and repeatable way is developed. Parylene films with various thicknesses could also be prepared in a single deposition run by using this method. This technique holds promising potentials in extensive applications, such as protection/dielectric layer for needle electrodes and flexible electronics, semi-permeable membrane, and other polymer engineering...|$|E
40|$|Briefly, {{the methods}} of {{determining}} low vapor pressures have been reviewed. Emphasis {{has been placed on}} <b>molecular</b> <b>effusion,</b> including a theoretical discussion and the subsequent application of molecular beams to the determination of vapor pressure. The problems met in the preparation, purification and handling of anhydrous zirconium tetrachloride have been discussed. Vapor pressure measurements on zirconium tetrachloride have been made over a temperature range of fifty degrees, 70 deg C. to 120 deg C,. and the mean molar heat of sublimation for this temperature range has been calculated. The value of 20. 3 kcal per mole obtained is not unreasonable {{in view of the fact}} that values for the same quantity determined by other investigators in the temperature range of 239 deg C. to 346 deg C. is reported to be 24. 4 kcal. per mole.
