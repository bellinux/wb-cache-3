40|$|Abstract]: The aim of {{this project}} {{is to reduce the}} loss of energy {{escaping}} from open <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> doors. This project also aims to prevent the formation of ice in the insulation layer of the <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> floor, eliminating the effects of the bumpy floor surface. Ultimately, the purpose of the project is to find ways to reduce operational costs of the industrial <b>cold</b> <b>room.</b> In the process of meeting the objectives, research and investigations are carried out on the industrial <b>cold</b> <b>room.</b> Because the structure is fully functional, many areas are considered off-limits; however, the following areas: • Cold storage doors • Door frame heaters • Defrosting schedules • Ground heater The loss of energy from the open cold storage doors could be eliminated by using the concept of an air-curtain. A ground heater design was proposed for the <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> floor and optimum defrosting schedules were determined; however, there are difficulties in finding a solution for the door frame heaters. The benefits obtained from these recommendations is that the operating costs of the industrial <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> can be reduced, defrosting of the air-blowers occurs when necessary, the problem of the uneven floor surface is solved and the elimination of the loss of energy from open <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> doors...|$|R
40|$|The first Korean <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> {{facility}} for ice mechanics experiments was assembled in 2004. Since then, the 4 m x 6 m <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> facility {{has been extensively}} used under various different environmental and loading conditions. After reviewing published references on <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> testing methods and also by trial and error, the standard procedures for testing and preparing laboratory ice material were established for the measurement of basic ice properties. In this paper, laboratory experimental techniques with the <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> facility and standard procedures established for ice material properties are introduced. Test specimens include laboratory-grown fresh water ice and frozen soils. Tests are carried out for unconfined compressive strength. Preparation and dimension of the specimen {{are the most important}} issues arising in <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> tests. The details of specimen preparation, testing procedure and strength test results are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>rooms</b> are {{commonly}} used for food storage and preparation, and are usually kept around 4020 F following food safety guidelines. Some food preparation employees may spend 8 or more hours inside <b>cold</b> <b>rooms.</b> These employees {{may not be aware}} of the risks associated with mildly cold temperatures, dampness, and limited ventilation. We performed an evaluation of <b>cold</b> <b>rooms</b> at an airline catering facility because of concerns with exposure to cold temperatures. We spoke with and observed employees in two <b>cold</b> <b>rooms,</b> reviewed daily temperature logs, evaluated employee's physical activity, work/rest schedule, and protective clothing. We measured temperature, percent relative humidity, and air velocities at different work stations inside the <b>cold</b> <b>rooms.</b> We concluded that thermal comfort concerns perceived by <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> employees may have been the result of air drafts at their workstations, insufficient use of personal protective equipment due to dexterity concerns, work practices, and lack of knowledge about good health and safety practices in <b>cold</b> <b>rooms.</b> These moderately <b>cold</b> work conditions with low air velocities are not well covered in current occupational health and safety guidelines, and wind chill calculations do not apply. We provide practical recommendations to improve thermal comfort of <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> employees. Engineering control recommendations include the redesigning of air deflectors and installing of suspended baffles. Administrative controls include the changing out of wet clothing, providing hand warmers outside of <b>cold</b> <b>rooms,</b> and educating employees on cold stress. We also recommended providing more options on personal protective equipment. However, {{there is a need for}} guidelines and educational materials tailored to employees in moderately cold environments to improve thermal comfort and minimize health and safety problems.

If the flow is Boussinesq (and the room is otherwise symmetrical), then viewing the <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> upside down is exactly the same as viewing the warm room right-way-round.

Temperature, velocity, humidity and heat transfer coefficient measurements were carried out in a ventilated <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> filled with four apple pallets. The front pallets near the cooling unit were submitted to higher air temperatures compared to the rear ones, leading to product cooling rate and temperature heterogeneity. The experimental results allow the understanding of mechanism of airflow as well as heat and water exchanges between product and air. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation of {{temperature}} distribution in <b>cold</b> <b>rooms</b> {{is an important}} consideration {{in the design of}} food storage solutions. Two common approaches used in both industry and academia to address this question are the deployment of wireless sensors, and modelling with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). However, for a realworld evaluation {{of temperature}} distribution in a <b>cold</b> <b>room,</b> both approaches have their limitations. For wireless sensors, it is economically unfeasible to carry out large-scale deployment (to obtain a high resolution of temperature distribution); while with CFD modelling, it is usually not accurate enough to get a reliable result. In this paper, we propose a model-based framework which combines the wireless sensors technique with CFD modelling technique together to achieve a satisfactory trade-off between minimum number of wireless sensors and the accuracy of temperature profile in <b>cold</b> <b>rooms.</b> A case study is presented to demonstrate the usability of the framework...|$|R
