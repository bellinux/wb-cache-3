5|$|In the {{pre-season}} of 2008–09, a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> {{was raised}} against club president Joan Laporta. This motion received 60percent support, {{just short of}} the 66percent required to oust him, prompting eight of the directors to resign. Continuing as president, Laporta made large changes to the playing staff, spending nearly €90million rebuilding the squad.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia may {{dissolve}} Parliament {{upon the}} request of the government if the government proposes a confidence motion to Parliament and the majority of all deputies adopt a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> or if Parliament fails to approve government budget 120 days after the budget is proposed in the parliament. That decision must be countersigned by the Prime Minister to become valid. The President may also dissolve Parliament after a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> supported by a majority of all deputies has been adopted and a new government cannot be formed within 30 days or if a new government cannot be formed after general elections (maximum period of 120 days). However, the President may not dissolve Parliament at {{the request of}} the government if a procedure to determine if the President has violated provisions of the constitution is in progress.|$|E
50|$|Specific <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> or censure <b>motions</b> {{against the}} Prime Minister, ministers, the Leader of the Opposition, Senators {{and leaders of}} {{political}} parties have been moved and have been successful on some occasions. <b>Motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> against the Government may be passed in the Senate, yet may {{have little or no}} impact in the House.|$|R
50|$|The Tong Sang {{government}} {{was the third}} French Polynesian government to fall to <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in the preceding three years, prompting calls for reform.|$|R
50|$|As U.S. {{political}} tradition {{does not}} include <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence,</b> laws provide {{for the removal of}} specific people. All of these processes are designed to be rare.|$|R
5|$|On 16 August 1938, {{after only}} serving {{a few months}} {{as a member of}} parliament, Treatt was {{appointed}} as the Minister for Justice in the government of Alexander Mair, who had become Premier after Bertram Stevens was defeated in a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in the house. In 1940, he was made a King's Counsel (KC).|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 2008 Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko {{announced}} a reshuffle {{of the cabinet}} after the forming of a BYuT, OU-PSD and Bloc of Lytvyn coalition following the 2008 Ukrainian political crisis. On March 3, 2010 the Ukrainian Parliament passed a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in the second Tymoshenko Government. A day before that the coalition had already lost the parliamentary majority. On March 11, 2010 the First Azarov Government was elected.|$|E
5|$|Nauru had 17changes of {{administration}} between 1989 and 2003. Bernard Dowiyogo died in office in March 2003 and Ludwig Scotty was elected as the president, later being re-elected {{to serve a}} full term in October 2004. Following a vote of no confidence on 19 December 2007, Scotty was replaced by Marcus Stephen. Stephen resigned in November 2011, and Freddie Pitcher became President. Sprent Dabwido then filed a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in Pitcher, resulting in him becoming president. Following parliamentary elections in 2013, Baron Waqa was elected president.|$|E
50|$|In presidential systems, the {{legislature}} may occasionally pass <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> {{and may also}} have the procedure of impeachment by which an executive or judicial officer can be removed.|$|R
50|$|McKenzie {{lost the}} {{confidence}} of his local UKIP branch, amid claims {{he and his partner}} Marianne Bowness mishandled thousands of pounds of branch funds. He was suspended as branch chairman, and later replaced. Members signed <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in McKenzie.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{numerous}} <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> being tabled in the Knesset, {{a government}} {{has only been}} defeated by one once, when Yitzhak Shamir's government was brought down on 15 March 1990 {{as part of a}} plot that became known as the dirty trick.|$|R
5|$|Once elected for a four-year-term, Federal Councillors {{can neither}} be voted {{out of office}} by a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> nor can they be impeached. Re-election is {{possible}} for an indefinite number of terms. Parliament {{has decided not to}} re-elect a sitting Councillor only four times, and only twice (in 2003 and 2007) {{since the beginning of the}} 20th century. In practice, therefore, Councillors serve until they decide to resign and retire to private life, usually after three to five terms of office.|$|E
5|$|The 1994 {{national}} {{convention of the}} Progress Party of Norway was held from 15 April to 17 April at the hotel Bolkesjø Turisthotell in Bolkesjø, Telemark. It was originally set {{up to be a}} normal convention with 157 delegates in a non-election year, but because of mounting antagonism between a traditionalist and a libertarian faction, it became clear some months before the conventions that personal positions could be at stake. The party leader seat, held by Carl I. Hagen since 1978, was up for re-election. The deputy leaders Ellen Wibe and Hans J. Røsjorde was not up for election until 1995, but there were talks about forming a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> against Wibe. The political disagreements roughly corresponded to a cleavage between two factions.|$|E
5|$|The Executive {{branch of}} Japan {{is headed by}} the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister {{is the head of}} the Cabinet, and is {{designated}} by the legislative organ, the National Diet. The Cabinet consists of the Ministers of State and may be appointed or dismissed by the Prime Minister at any time. Explicitly defined to be the source of executive power, it is in practice, however, mainly exercised by the Prime Minister. The practice of its powers is responsible to the Diet, and as a whole, should the Cabinet lose confidence and support to be in office by the Diet, the Diet may dismiss the Cabinet en masse with a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{deal with}} this situation, the French placed {{a greater degree of}} {{executive}} power in the office of its President, who is immune from <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence,</b> along with a two-round plurality voting system that makes easier the formation of stable majority governments.|$|R
50|$|Such {{reversals}} {{of fortune}} and a revolving-door succession of prime ministers continue to characterize Papua New Guinea's national politics. A plethora of political parties, coalition governments, shifting party loyalties and <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> {{in the leadership}} all lend an air of instability to political proceedings.|$|R
50|$|A {{majority}} {{government is}} usually assured of having its legislation passed and rarely, if ever, has to fear being defeated in parliament. In contrast, a minority government must constantly bargain for support from other parties {{in order to}} pass legislation and avoid being defeated on <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence.</b>|$|R
5|$|In July 1939, Stevens and Colonial Treasurer Alexander Mair {{attempted}} to address Spooner's unwillingness to accede to cabinet decisions regarding ministerial expenditure {{by creating a}} committee of four, consisting of Mair, Stevens, Spooner and Bruxner, to approve all expenditure. Furious at this gesture, Spooner resigned on 21 July 1939 as Minister and Deputy Leader, citing a 'disagreement in government policy on relief works' as the reason. Despite Spooner's departure, {{the stability of the}} government was to be short. On 1 August 1939, Spooner carried a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in Stevens in the house, which unexpectedly passed by two votes, owing to the absence of several ministers. On 3 August Stevens tendered his resignation to the Governor, Lord Wakehurst, but was granted several days to remain until his successor was chosen.|$|E
5|$|In the House, {{desultory}} {{debate on}} Fraser's censure motion ended with it being amended by the ALP majority into a condemnation of Fraser and passed on a party line vote. By 2.34pm, when Fraser rose {{and announced that}} he had been commissioned as Prime Minister, word of the dismissal had spread through the House. Fraser announced his intent to advise a double dissolution, and moved that the House adjourn. His motion was defeated. Fraser's new government suffered repeated defeats in the House, which passed a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in him, and asked the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to urge the Governor-General to recommission Whitlam. Scholes, attempting to communicate this to the Governor General, was initially told that an appointment might not be possible that day, but after stating that he would reconvene the House and tell them of the refusal, was given an appointment with Kerr for 4.45pm.|$|E
25|$|The Government {{does not}} need to have the {{confidence}} of the new Senate, and the Senate cannot pass a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> against the Government.|$|E
50|$|After Tong Sang's ouster, {{which was}} the third time a French Polynesian {{government}} was ousted from power via <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> since 2004, calls for electoral reform were heard. This culminated in an electoral reform package that was passed by France in November of the same year.|$|R
50|$|Despite their {{importance}} to the British constitution, {{for a long time}} the rules surrounding <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> were dictated by convention. However, since the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a vote <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> means the government has 14 days in which to win a vote of confidence, or a general election is held.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} {{have served}} as Leaders of the Official Opposition in Solomon Islands. (Given the fluctuating nature of majority coalitions, successful <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> and thus changes in government are frequent during a parliamentary term. Consequently, there are in most cases several successive Leaders of the Opposition during a single Parliament.) ...|$|R
25|$|The House of Representatives on August 22 {{rejected}} the GNA's government with {{most members of}} the parliament voting against the government in a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Passos Coelho's {{government}} fell on a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence,</b> and the President appointed Antonio Costa, {{the leader}} of the Socialists, as Prime Minister in his place.|$|E
25|$|Together with Ann Coffey she {{submitted}} {{a letter to}} the Parliamentary Labour Party chairman requesting a vote on a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in the party leader Jeremy Corbyn in June 2016.|$|E
50|$|<b>Motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> {{fall into}} three categories. Motions {{initiated}} by the Government, those {{initiated by the}} Opposition, and motions which {{can be regarded as}} issues of confidence because of particular circumstances. The first category are effectively threats of dissolution as occurred in 1993 so that John Major could pass the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty.|$|R
50|$|While {{electronic}} voting {{has become the}} norm the Dáil votes manually through the lobbies {{at the back of}} the chamber on a number of occasions, for example, <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence.</b> A teller in an electronic vote can call a manual vote if they so wish. This has become an opposition tactic during important votes which are widely covered in the media.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2007 {{municipal}} elections, {{although the}} party was disappointed with the general results, it won a plurality in Vilnius, and formed a coalition with the Social Democratic Party (LSDP) under mayor Juozas Imbrasas. [...] This is despite Law and Order members of the Seimas then supporting <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in several LSDP cabinet members for handling of the privatisation of Alita.|$|R
25|$|On 24 December 2010, a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> against Maatia Toafa {{was carried}} by eight votes to seven. On 25 December 2010 Willy Telavi was elected prime {{minister}} with an (8:7) majority over Enele Sopoaga.|$|E
25|$|The {{resignation}} did not {{quell the}} consequences of Cowen’s actions, however. Eamon Gilmore {{announced that he would}} go forward with his <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> on Wednesday, 26 January. Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny also announced that if Cowen did not ask President Mary McAleese for an immediate dissolution of the Dáil Éireann, his own party would put forward a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in the Taoiseach on Tuesday, ahead of Labour's motion. Then, on Sunday the 23rd, John Gormley announced that the Green Party was withdrawing from the government coalition, leaving Cowen {{at the head of a}} minority government (with seven ministers, the absolute minimum mandated by the constitution) and facing two consecutive no-confidence votes in the Dáil.|$|E
25|$|In May 2006, the Irish Nurses Organisation {{unanimously}} {{passed a}} <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in Mary Harney, accusing her of being negative and antagonistic towards nurses. Her policy of transferring private beds in public hospitals to privately operated hospitals also attracted criticism.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Cassidy became {{embroiled in}} a dispute with the {{university}} vice-chancellor, Alan Pettigrew over the demarcation of roles between the two offices. In June 2008, the staff passed <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in the chancellor. Despite attempts at mediation by Sir Laurence Street, on 10 November 2008, {{it was announced that}} Cassidy's appointment as chancellor would not be renewed for a second term, and he was replaced by Richard Torbay.|$|R
5000|$|Though Vanuatu {{is a full}} democracy, its {{political}} culture {{is different from that}} in most Western democracies, with strong elements of clientelism, and political debate that focuses strongly on the distribution of resources among communities rather than ideology. Governments typically comprise coalitions of numerous small parties which change regularly, with parties and MPs [...] "crossing the floor" [...] and Prime Ministers being ousted in <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{need of a}} prime {{minister}} to retain the support of her own MPs was illustrated by the case of Margaret Thatcher, who resigned in 1990 after being challenged for {{the leadership of the}} Conservative Party. The strength of party discipline within the Commons, enforced by the whip system, is shown {{by the fact that the}} two most recent <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in which a Government was defeated occurred in 1924 and 1979.|$|R
