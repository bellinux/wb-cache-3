5000|$|Although {{most people}} cannot {{determine}} if steel has undergone the {{hardening and tempering}} process by simply looking at it, there is a reliable and simple test. When examining a piece of steel, obtain a hand file and file an edge of the selected metal. If the piece of steel has not undergone the hardening and tempering process, the <b>metal</b> <b>file</b> should easily 'bite' into the sample. If the metal has been hardened, the file fails to cut into the sample and glances off with little visible effect.|$|E

50|$|Emery {{boards are}} {{generally}} less abrasive than the <b>metal</b> nail <b>files,</b> and hence, emery boards may {{take longer to}} file down nails than <b>metal</b> nail <b>files.</b> However, nail files {{may play a role}} in disease transmission if they are used on more than one person without adequate sterilization. Emery boards are usually less expensive than <b>metal</b> nail <b>files,</b> therefore emery boards can be economically disposed of after use on a single person.The nail can be smoothed and shaped accurately by taking light, even strokes in one direction across the top of the nail. Twenty to thirty easy strokes can typically shorten excessively long fingernails, while five to ten strokes are sufficient for shaping the nails.|$|R
5000|$|Instruments may {{separate}} (break) during {{root canal}} treatment, meaning {{a portion of}} the <b>metal</b> <b>file</b> used during the procedure remains inside the tooth. The file segment may be left behind if an acceptable level of cleaning and shaping has already been completed and attempting to remove the segment would risk damage to the tooth. While potentially disconcerting to the patient, having metal inside of a tooth is relatively common, such as with metal posts, amalgam fillings, gold crowns, and porcelain fused to metal crowns. The occurrence of file separation is proportional to the narrowness, curvature, length, calcification and number of roots on the tooth being treated. Complications resulting from incompletely cleaned canals, due to blockage from the separated file, can be addressed with surgical root canal treatment.

50|$|Sometimes {{cultures}} developed {{two main}} types of saw teeth: the 'cross cut' saw teeth and the 'rip' saw teeth. These {{cut into the}} wood using different mechanisms. Wood is composed of many long cells running length-ways. Thus, crosscut saws have sawteeth that are usually shaped, often with a <b>metal</b> <b>file,</b> {{in such a way}} that they form a series of tiny knifelike edges.The wood cells are contacted by the knife-edge of the tooth and cut. Rip saws, on the other hand, are usually shaped so that they form a series of tiny chisel-like edges. The wood cells are contacted by the chisel and 'ripped' apart from the bundle of other cells. It is common that people do not recognize the difference and use saws both ways. However, a rip saw is much faster than a cross-cut saw when cutting with the grain but leaves a very rough cut, often with splinters on the surface, and has more difficulty maintaining a straight cut when cutting across the grain. The cross-cut saw can cut in any direction but is much slower than needs be when cutting with the grain.|$|E

40|$|Databases, {{collections}} of related data, are {{as old as}} the written word. A database can be anything from a homemaker's <b>metal</b> recipe <b>file</b> to a sophisticated data warehouse. Yet today, when we think of a database we invariably think of computerized data and their DBMSs (database management systems). How did we go from organizing our data in a simple <b>metal</b> <b>filing</b> box or cabinet to storing our data in a sophisticated computerized database? How did the computerized database evolve? This paper defines what we mean by a database. It traces the evolution of the database, from its start as a non-computerized set of related data, to the, now standard, computerized RDBMS (relational database management system). Early computerized storage methods are reviewed including both the ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method) and VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) storage methods. Early database models are explored including the network and hierarchical database models. Eventually, the relational, object-relational and object-oriented databases models are discussed. An appendix of diagrams, including hierarchical occurrence tree, network schema, ER (entity relationship) and UML (unified modeling language) diagrams, is included to support the text. This paper concludes with an exploration of current and future trends in DBMS development. It discusses the factors affecting these trends. It delves into the relationship between DBMSs and the increasingly popular object-oriented development methodologies. Finally, it speculates {{on the future of the}} DBMS.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} evaluate surface sampling protocols for use with culture and quantitative PCR (QPCR) amplification assay for detection of the gram-negative bacterial biothreat simulant Erwinia herbicola {{on a variety of}} surface materials. Surfaces selected for evaluation were wood laminate, glass and computer monitor screens, <b>metal</b> <b>file</b> cabinets, plastic arena seats, nylon seat cushions, finished concrete flooring, and vinyl tile flooring. Laboratory and test chamber studies were performed to evaluate two sampling methods, a sponge and a macrofoam swab, for detection of E. herbicola on surface materials. In laboratory trials, seven materials were inoculated with a known concentration of E. herbicola cells and samples were collected from the surfaces of the materials to determine sampling efficiencies. Culture analysis was ineffective for assessing E. herbicola collection efficiency because very few culturable cells were obtained from surface samples. QPCR demonstrated that E. herbicola DNA was present in high concentrations on all of the surface samples, and sampling efficiencies ranged from 0. 7 to 52. 2 %, depending on the sampling method and the surface material. The swab was generally more efficient than the sponge for collection of E. herbicola from surfaces. Test chamber trials were also performed in which E. herbicola was aerosolized into the chamber and allowed to settle onto test materials. Surface sampling results supported those obtained in laboratory trials. The results of this study demonstrate the capabilities of QPCR to enhance the detection and enumeration of biocontaminants on surface materials and provide information on the comparability of sampling methods...|$|E
