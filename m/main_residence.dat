5|$|Throughout {{the period}} of {{absolute}} monarchy, from 1782 to 1932, the Grand Palace was both the country's administrative and religious centre. As the <b>main</b> <b>residence</b> of the monarch, the palace was also the seat of government, with thousands of inhabitants including guardsmen, servants, concubines, princesses, ministers and courtiers. The palace's high whitewashed castellated walls and extensive forts and guard posts mirrored those of the walls of Bangkok itself, and thus the Grand Palace was envisioned as a city within a city. For this reason a special set of Palace Laws were created to govern the inhabitants and to establish hierarchy and order.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, the Despensers were {{increasingly}} using Caerphilly Castle as their <b>main</b> <b>residence</b> {{in the region}} rather than Cardiff.

In 1401 rebellion broke out in North Wales {{under the leadership of}} Owain Glyndŵr, quickly spreading across the rest of the country. In 1404 Cardiff and the castle were taken by the rebels, causing considerable damage to the Black Tower and the southern gatehouse in the process. On Thomas's death the castle passed first to his young son, Richard, and on his death in 1414, through his daughter Isabel to the Beauchamp family.

The castle was passed through the de Clare line until Gilbert de Clare died at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314, when the estate passed onto his sisters. Elizabeth de Clare, whose husband John de Burgh had died the previous year, acquired the castle; the combined estates made Elizabeth one of the wealthiest women in England. Elizabeth used the castle as her <b>main</b> <b>residence</b> between 1322 and 1360.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the stylistic}} {{innovations}} Radama adopted {{for the construction}} of several of the compound's buildings, the Rova largely retained its traditional features during his reign. The basic layout of the compound remained largely unaltered from its original design with the sole exception of an expansion of the Rova along its north-south axis. Stone walls topped with sharpened wooden stakes were built around the new perimeter during this period. Venerable buildings such as Besakana, Nanjakana, Mahitsy and Manjakamiadana were retained, as were the houses of several of Andrianampoinimerina's wives, many of whom were still living at the time of Radama's death in 1828. During his reign, Radama undertook the restoration of Marivolanitra to serve chiefly as housing for visiting foreigners, and briefly inhabited it himself in addition to his <b>main</b> <b>residence</b> at Besakana. He also had a house called Kelisoa ("Petite Beauty") built as a lodging for his concubines.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 7th century on, Klis was an {{important}} Croat stronghold, and later, one of the seats of many Croatia's rulers.

Despite Frankish overlordship, the Franks had almost no role in Croatia in the period from the 820s through 840s. After Mislav's death, starting with Duke Trpimir I, Klis was ruled by royal members of the House of Trpimirović, who were at first Dukes of the Croatian Duchy (dux Croatorum), and afterwards Kings of the Croatian Kingdom (rex Croatorum).
