25|$|There is not {{happiness}} in Ibn Salam's house. Leyli is ill by depression. She confesses to husband that she loves geys and can't love anybody anymore. Let Ibn Salam waits, <b>maybe</b> <b>her</b> feelings to Majnun will pass. Pained Ibn Salam goes away. And suddenly Majnun again appears {{in front of}} Leyli as a bodiless shadow. He bitterly complaints to Leyli, that she has betrayed him, destroyed his life, brought sorrow and pain. Forgetting about her illness, Leyli throws herself into her lover's arms, but he doesn't recognize her, he looks for and calls his former, pure lover.|$|E
500|$|Maisie Williams {{also spoke}} with Entertainment Weekly and {{described}} the process behind Arya's scenes, saying [...] "We wanted people to think {{this could be the}} end, or the start of the end. Like <b>maybe</b> <b>her</b> wound is going to fester – like The Hound. We did so many different takes of emerging out of the water the first time she's stabbed and sliced. I had been to a music festival so I hadn't slept the whole weekend. Then I was jumping in the Irish sea. It was a totally manic day. We did a million different takes. We wanted it to be real frantic and panicked. Arya hasn't been emotional in a long time and we wanted to bring that emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|Kristin Booker of {{the fashion}} website Refinery29 {{described}} the scent as a [...] "voluptuous, sexy floral". Kathleen Hou writing for New York opined that the perfume's best part {{was that it was}} inspired by a poem by Angelou. Hou also noted feminist influences in the scent with usual additions of orchid and masculine notes of autumn woods, cashmere, musk, and vetiver extract. She concluded her review by stating [...] "Maya Angelou-reading perfume sounds (and will surely smell) pretty good". With a similar opinion, Treye Green of the International Business Times noted more masculine notes with the addition of woods, cashmere, musk. She hailed Rise as a [...] "sweet treat" [...] for her fans along her self-titled album's surprise release a week earlier and noted, [...] "Beyoncé's definition of feminism has stirred quite the debate following her new album's release. But <b>maybe</b> <b>her</b> perfume version of it will be more openly embraced – plus who can deny the genius of a Maya Angelou-inspired scent." [...] Madison Lafayette in an article for VIBE Vixen praised Beyoncé's decision to release Rise [...] "capitaliz off" [...] her success and [...] "giving us another reason to talk about her".|$|E

I just thought about that situation specifically because that’s a little girl who witnessed a real traumatic event. It’s unfortunate. So I just felt like, <b>maybe</b> instead of <b>her</b> having a lasting memory of that traumatic event, <b>maybe</b> brighten up <b>her</b> holiday season.” ...|$|R

500|$|In an interview, Maisie Williams {{described}} the thought process behind Arya's scenes, {{as well as}} the process of filming saying [...] "We wanted people to think this could be the end, or the start of the end. Like <b>maybe</b> <b>her</b> wound is going to fester – like The Hound." [...] She continued, [...] "There was this constant spectrum of conversation with Mark Mylod during the chase of about how petrified she needs to look, but also how safe she is. Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he was really good. So I wanted her to look like she was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman. I got on set {{and they were going to}} have Arya rolling around, and diving, and I was like, [...] "That looks amazing, but no." [...] I'd be like, [...] "Why would she run over there? She'd just duck under here and just get out." [...] It doesn’t look quite as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is to make everything look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now. In the beginning it was a lot of guesswork and now I've figured her out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Davis who {{answered}} the phone from Rich and Friedman, said, [...] "I love the song the way it is; it's a hit. Of course, {{take a shot at}} rewriting the lyric, but whatever you do, don't lose the hitness of it. If the rewrite doesn't work, we can use the song on a future Whitney project, <b>maybe</b> <b>her</b> greatest hits album." [...] Rich and Friedman ultimately rewrote the entire lyric except for the title. They then redemoed the song and sent the new version to Davis. Davis, Jackson and everyone involved loved the new version of [...] "Run to You", so the song was finally set for the movie.|$|E
2500|$|A notable {{aspect of}} Henin's playing style was the {{completeness}} of her game – {{the variety and}} versatility she had. Her style was often {{compared to that of}} Roger Federer and to five-time Grand Slam winner Martina Hingis as well. Four-time Grand Slam winner Kim Clijsters commented [...] "Growing up together, she's always been the more touchy player. She has good hands ... she has those quick hands." [...] Former world No. 1 Andy Roddick praised Henin's and Hingis' racket skills, saying [...] "She has probably the best racket skills of any female player I’ve seen, <b>maybe</b> <b>her</b> [...] and Justine." [...] Hingis herself also similarly said [...] "Players were better educated [...] Now it's sheer power. You kind of miss the players like myself or Justine Henin." ...|$|E
5000|$|There's no {{question}} about it. Gita is incredibly intelligent, very strong analysis .... She's done great work for us. And I think the real tragedy of this particular circumstance is by going public in this particular way knowing that we were addressing her issue means that she's <b>maybe</b> undermining <b>her</b> own work in fact.|$|R

2500|$|In {{a review}} in Art Monthly in 2000 a critic {{described}} Starr's new exhibition in London The Bunny Lakes are Coming: [...] "Art {{is meant to}} be more sensitive than popular culture but doesn't always manage it. The Bunny Lakes are Coming is a melange of pop cultural melancholy and terror that is as sensitive as a fresh bruise. Starr's longstanding interest in the exploration of internality through the products of popular culture has been chided in the past. If returning home is a way of testing whether you have moved one, Starr has not endeavoured to please. Her new work is as dark as her early work was light. <b>Maybe</b> <b>her</b> early work was too soft, now it's too soft to touch." ...|$|E

6000|$|Again {{the loud}} cry of {{distress}} {{came on the}} night air. [...] "They have not seized her yet," [...] Beric said. [...] "Her first cry would have been her last had they done so.

60|$|For a while I kept still. I {{was utterly}} squelched. And {{to think that}} I had twice {{protected}} her from attack--the last time risking my life to save hers. It was incredible that even a daughter of the Stone Age could be so ungrateful--so heartless; but <b>maybe</b> <b>her</b> heart partook of the qualities of her epoch.|$|E
60|$|Lady Hester Lea was {{the heroine}} of the neighbourhood. The {{romance of the}} disowned {{daughter}} was charming; and I was far too disagreeable to excite any counterbalancing pity. She was handsome, and everybody raved about her likeness to poor papa and the family portraits; and her Montreal convent had given her manners quite distinct from English vulgarity; or, <b>maybe,</b> <b>her</b> blood told on her bearing, for she was immensely admired for her demeanour, quite as much as for her beauty.|$|E
50|$|The novel {{ends with}} Ann {{shown to be}} a scared but strong person who broke under torture, Emmett still believing in <b>her</b> and <b>maybe</b> loving <b>her,</b> and her father {{offering}} Emmett a job in South America which would get the two out of the country for awhile. The FBI now know Dr. Kissel is a communist agent, and can feed the Soviet Union false information.|$|R

60|$|She {{walked home}} {{instead of taking}} the bus. She wanted to think. A day or two would decide the question. She {{determined}} that if the miracle did not happen, she would go down to Liverpool. Her father was on the committee {{of one of the}} great hospitals; and she knew {{one or two of the}} matrons. She would want to be doing something--to get out to the front, if possible. <b>Maybe,</b> <b>her</b> desire to serve was not altogether free from curiosity--from the craving for adventure.
