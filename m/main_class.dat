5|$|Shooters are {{generally}} {{divided into four}} classes: men, junior men, women and junior women. The junior classes are included in most championships, with some notable exceptions (such as the Olympic Games and the ISSF World Cup). A shooter remains a junior {{up to and including}} the calendar year in which he or she becomes 21 years of age, although a junior may opt to participate in the <b>main</b> <b>class</b> instead.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of the bullet can exclude {{a large number of}} weapons by examining the general characteristics of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures. The three <b>main</b> <b>class</b> characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the caliber of the bullet, and the rifling twist. All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire the bullet. The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the rifling is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.|$|E

40|$|In 1990, Kolesova, Lam and Thiel {{determined}} the 283, 657 <b>main</b> <b>classes</b> of Latin squares of order 8. Using techniques to determine relevant Latin trades and integer programming, we examine representatives {{of each of}} these <b>main</b> <b>classes</b> and determine that none can contain a uniquely completable set of size less than 16. In three of these <b>main</b> <b>classes,</b> the use of trades which contain {{less than or equal to}} three rows, columns, or elements does not suffice to determine this fact. We closely examine properties of representatives of these three <b>main</b> <b>classes.</b> Writing the <b>main</b> result in Nelder's notation for critical sets, we prove that scs(8) = 16.

25|$|Within the British Empire, the <b>main</b> <b>class</b> {{of people}} who were not British {{subjects}} were the rulers of native states formally under the protection of the British Crown, and their subjects. Many such smaller states, especially in India, were for most practical purposes administered by the imperial government, but sovereignty rested in their rulers and not in the British Crown, and all such persons were (and still are) considered to have been born outside the sovereignty and allegiance of the Crown, and are known as British Protected Persons.|$|E

60|$|In {{the great}} {{class of the}} Articulata, we may start from an optic nerve simply coated with pigment, the latter {{sometimes}} forming a sort of pupil, but destitute of lens or other optical contrivance. With insects it is now known that the numerous facets on the cornea of their great compound eyes form true lenses, and that the cones include curiously modified nervous filaments. But these organs in the Articulata are so much diversified that Muller formerly made three main classes with seven subdivisions, besides a fourth <b>main</b> <b>class</b> of aggregated simple eyes.|$|E
