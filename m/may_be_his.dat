5|$|Presumably, he died either {{during the}} reign of William I or during the {{following}} reign of William II. Possibly, he was buried at Cirencester, where a stone tomb in the crypt of the Saxon-era church still exists and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>his.</b> After his death, a group of his lands became the basis for the foundation of Cirencester Abbey by King Henry I of England in 1133. Regenbald's brother held land near him in Cirencester. Regenbald had a son named Edward who also held lands in Gloucester.|$|E

5|$|Putnam himself <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> own most {{formidable}} philosophical adversary. His frequent changes of mind have {{led him to}} attack his previous positions. However, many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists. For example, multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, {{to be able to}} conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species). Other criticisms of metaphysical realism have been proposed by Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland.|$|E

5|$|Thereafter Domnall disappears from record {{until his}} death, {{as an old}} man at Lismore, dated by the Annals of the Four Masters to 1135. The annal-entry itself {{describes}} him as a one-time lord of Leinster, which could be evidence that {{he had tried to}} seize Leinster at some point in his career. The Annals of Tigernach apparently also record Domnall's death, although the annal-entry identifies him as a grandson of Muirchertach Ua Briain. Long afterwards in 1157, Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain (died 1166), a contender to the Irish high-kingship, invaded the partitioned Munster and forced the submission of Diarmait Mac Carthaig, and further drove out Toirdelbach mac Diarmata Uí Briainthe son of Domnall's aforesaid uncle, Diarmait Ua Briainand replaced him with another Uí Briain dynast, Conchobar mac Domnaill Uí Briain, King of Ormond. The latter was likely a brother of Lughaid mac Domnaill Uí Briain who was slain in the battle of Móin Mhór in 1151. Both menConchobar and Lughaidcould well have been sons of Domnall himself, although another candidate <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> like-named first cousin, Domnall mac Taidc.|$|E

25|$|Arshile Gorky's {{portrait}} of what <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> friend Willem de Kooning (left) {{is an example}} of the evolution of Abstract Expressionism from the context of figure painting, cubism and surrealism. Along with his friends de Kooning and John D. Graham Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.|$|E

Shaara's primary source material for researching the novel included the diaries, letters and correspondence of figures who were either involved in or present at the Battle.|$|E

He went on to finish the season on three goals for the Blades, scoring both goals in a 2–1 home victory over Bristol City in the penultimate game of the 2007–08 season. In an interview with BBC Wales on 10 May 2008, Speed hinted that the 2008–09 season <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> last playing before moving into coaching or management but stated that he had not yet made up his mind.|$|E
