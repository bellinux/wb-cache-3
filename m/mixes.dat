Deconstruction said the <b>Mixes</b> album would be released as a triple-vinyl set and set the release date for the following year. However, fans voiced their concerns on expensive import prices for global shipping and with increasingly popular demand, Deconstruction scrapped the idea and released the remixes on a two-set compact disc, and forward the triple vinyl at a later date. This allowed Deconstruction to release the album earlier and <b>Mixes</b> was released on 3 August 1998 in the UK. Mushroom released Impossible Remixes on 8 July 1998, but initial pressings were on sale two months earlier.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} explore the effect of {{vibrating}} <b>mixing</b> technology in industrial production of concrete, the influence of vibrating <b>mixing</b> and common forced <b>mixing</b> on the <b>mixing</b> quality and efficiency were comparatively investigated by field tests of concrete <b>mixing</b> plant. The vibrating <b>mixing</b> scheme was achieved by adopting <b>mixing</b> shaft and blades as vibrating source based on conventional twin-shaft mixer. The field tests included <b>mixing</b> time test and reducing cement test. The experimental results show that under different <b>mixing</b> time, the freshly <b>mixed</b> concrete by both <b>mixing</b> methods have similar uniformity but the hardened concrete have distinctive compression strength; comparing with common forced <b>mixing,</b> vibrating <b>mixing</b> makes the materials in vibrating status to destroy their sticky connection and distribute cement particles, so both 7 d and 28 d compression strength are significantly improved and the <b>mixing</b> time is reduced; with the cement reduction, the compression strength of concrete by both <b>mixing</b> methods decrease, but comparing with common forced <b>mixing,</b> vibrating <b>mixing</b> can save cement under the condition of ensuring necessary concrete strength due to its improved cement utilization...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the paper, the {{optimization}} of the coagulation {{process for}} Kaolin and humic acid removal using polymeric aluminum ferric sulfate (PAFS) was studied. In {{order to obtain}} the maximum turbidity and humic acid removal efficiency of Kaolin and humic acid simulated wastewater, the optimum coagulation conditions was investigated with the factors of <b>mixing</b> speed and time. Furthermore, <b>mixing</b> speed and time including parameters affecting the coagulation performance such as rapid <b>mixing</b> speed, rapid <b>mixing</b> time, slow <b>mixing</b> speed and slow <b>mixing</b> time using single factor and orthogonal array L 9 (34) analysis were examined.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a numerical study on <b>mixing</b> in a barrier embedded micromixer {{with an emphasis}} on the effect of periodic and aperiodic sequences of <b>mixing</b> protocols on <b>mixing</b> performance. A mapping method was employed to investigate <b>mixing</b> in various sequences, enabling us to qualitatively observe the progress of <b>mixing</b> and also to quantify both the rate and the final state of <b>mixing.</b> First, we introduce the design concept of the four <b>mixing</b> protocols and the route to achieve chaotic <b>mixing</b> of the mixer. Then, several periodic sequences consisting of the four <b>mixing</b> protocols are used to investigate the <b>mixing</b> performance depending on the sequence. Chaotic <b>mixing</b> was observed, but with different <b>mixing</b> rates and different final <b>mixing</b> states significantly influenced by the specific sequence of <b>mixing</b> protocols and inertia. As for the effect of inertia, the higher the Reynolds number the larger the rotational motion of the fluid leading to faster <b>mixing.</b> We found that a sequence showing the best <b>mixing</b> performance at a certain Reynolds number is not always superior to other sequences in a different Reynolds number regime. A properly chosen aperiodic sequence results in faster and more uniform <b>mixing</b> than periodic sequence...|$|R
