5000|$|... 24-Hour: a race lasting between 18-30+ hours, {{typically}} involving UTM-based (Universal Transverse <b>Mercator)</b> <b>navigation.</b> Often basic rope work {{is involved}} (e.g., traverses or rappels). 24-hour and longer races often require that competitors employ a support crew to transport gear {{from place to}} place. Other races do not permit support crews, with race organizers transporting gear bins to designated checkpoints for racers.|$|E
50|$|Stone {{joined the}} U.S. Navy when World War I started, {{and was the}} {{commanding}} officer of Submarine Chaser No. 1, sailing out of Hampton Roads and off the Virginia Capes. Later as a lieutenant and navigating officer of the USS Pastores he served on trans-Atlantic troop transport duty. When the war ended Stone and a few friends bought some cargo schooners and formed <b>Mercator</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company, operating in coastal and foreign trade. But that business soon closed as steam was replacing sail on the seas, and the operation of those schooners became economically impracticable.|$|E

50|$|Although it is {{impossible}} to see or make 4-dimensional objects, it is possible to map them into lower dimensions to get some impressions of them. An analogy for converting the 4-D 24-cell into its 3-D sculpture is cartographic projection, where the surface of the 3-D Earth (or a globe) is reduced to a flat 2-D plane (a portable map). This is done either with light 'casting a shadow' from the globe onto the map or with some mathematical transformation. Many different types of map projection exist: the familiar rectangular <b>Mercator</b> (used for <b>navigation),</b> the circular gnomonic (first projection invented), and several others. All of them have limitations in that they show some features in a distorted manner—'you can't flatten an orange peel without damaging it'—but they are useful visual aids and convenient references.|$|R
