The live cornea has a thin layer removed therefrom, leaving an exposed internal surface thereon. Then, either the surface or thin layer is exposed to the laser beam along a predetermined pattern to ablate desired portions. The thin layer is then replaced onto the surface. Ablating a central area of the surface or thin layer makes the cornea less curved, while ablating an annular area spaced {{from the center of}} the surface or layer makes the cornea more curved.

50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{components of}} a Fourier transform spectrometer include a polychromatic light source and a Michelson Interferometer with a <b>movable</b> <b>mirror.</b> When light goes into the interferometer, it is separated into two beams. 50% of the light reaches the static mirror {{and the other half}} reaches the <b>movable</b> <b>mirror.</b> The two light beams reflect from the mirrors and combine as a single beam again at the beam splitter. The combined beam travels through the sample and is finally collected by the detector. The retardation (total path difference) of the light beams between the static mirror and the <b>movable</b> <b>mirror</b> results in interference patterns. The IR absorption by the sample occurs at many frequencies and the resulting infereogram is composed of all frequencies except for those absorbed.

50|$|The Michelson {{spectrograph}} {{is similar}} to the instrument used in the Michelson-Morley experiment. Light from the source is split into two beams by a half-silvered mirror, one is reflected off a fixed mirror and one off a <b>movable</b> <b>mirror,</b> which introduces a time delay—the Fourier-transform spectrometer is just a Michelson interferometer with a <b>movable</b> <b>mirror.</b> The beams interfere, allowing the temporal coherence of the light to be measured at each different time delay setting, effectively converting the time domain into a spatial coordinate. By making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the <b>movable</b> <b>mirror,</b> the spectrum can be reconstructed using a Fourier transform of the temporal coherence of the light. Michelson spectrographs are capable of very high spectral resolution observations of very bright sources.The Michelson or Fourier-transform spectrograph was popular for infra-red applications at a time when infra-red astronomy only had single-pixel detectors. Imaging Michelson spectrometers are a possibility, but in general have been supplanted by imaging Fabry-Pérot instruments, which are easier to construct.|$|E

50|$|The {{realized}} films had 300 to 700 transparent {{pictures of}} successive phases of moving figures with black backgrounds. The pictures were hand painted by Reynaud in aniline inks directly on 6 x 6 cm gelatin plates. The plates were coated with shellac and framed {{in a cardboard}} strip of which the sides were clad in fabric bands attached with split pins. The horizontal film strip could be up to 50 meters long, with black leader tape at the beginning. Central perforations in the cardboard between the images engaged with metal notches protruding from a large central turning wheel. The wheel transferred the strip between two copper 25 cm spools. The film was guided further by pinch rollers {{at the corners of}} the table and passed in front of a magic lantern. The magic lantern projected each image in turn towards one of the 36 rectangular mirrors {{at the center of the}} turning wheel. Each image was in turn reflected to another mirror, which reflected it through a focusing lens towards a <b>movable</b> <b>mirror.</b> The <b>movable</b> <b>mirror</b> could be adjusted to project the moving characters at the desired place within an immobile background image on the screen. The background was projected with a second magic lantern from a painted glass plate.

50|$|Parallax error can be {{seen when}} taking photos with many types of cameras, such as twin-lens reflex cameras and those {{including}} viewfinders (such as rangefinder cameras). In such cameras, the eye sees the subject through different optics (the viewfinder, or a second lens) than the one through which the photo is taken.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the squeezing for a <b>movable</b> <b>mirror</b> in the dissipative optomechanics {{in which the}} oscillating mirror modulates both the resonance frequency and the linewidth of the cavity mode. Via feeding a much weaker broadband squeezed vacuum light accompanying the coherent driving laser field into the cavity, the master equation for the cavity-mirror system is derived by following the general reservoir theory based on the density operator in which the reservoir variables are adiabatically eliminated by using the reduced density operator for the system in the interaction picture. When the mirror is weakly coupled to the cavity mode, we find that under the conditions of laser cooling to the ground state, the driven cavity field can effectively perform as a squeezed vacuum reservoir for the <b>movable</b> <b>mirror</b> via utilizing the completely destructive interference of quantum noise, and thus the efficient transfer of squeezing from the light to the <b>movable</b> <b>mirror</b> occurs, which is irrespective of the ratio between the cavity damping rate and the mechanical frequency.
