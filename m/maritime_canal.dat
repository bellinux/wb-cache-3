50|$|The Brussels-Scheldt <b>Maritime</b> <b>Canal</b> (commonly {{named in}} various ways {{including}} Willebroek Canal and Brussels-Willebroek canal), is a canal in Belgium linking Brussels with the Scheldt river and ultimately the sea. The 28 km long canal has a width of 30 m. and a draught of 2 m., and connects the cities of Brussels and Willebroek, where it joins the Rupel river in the hamlet of Klein-Willebroek.

The greater ring runs along many parks: the Royal Domain, the Josaphat park, the Forest park, the Astrid park, the Scheutbos park, the Elisabeth park, the Jeugdpark and the Laeken park.

50|$|The 1848 {{discovery}} {{of gold in}} California and the rush of would-be miners stimulated US interest in building a canal between the oceans. In 1887, a United States Army Corps of Engineers regiment surveyed canal possibilities in Nicaragua. Two years later, the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Canal</b> Company was asked to begin a canal {{in the area and}} chose Nicaragua. The company lost money in the panic of 1893, and its work in Nicaragua ceased. In 1897 and 1899, the United States Congress charged a canal commission with researching possible construction; Nicaragua was chosen as the location both times.|$|E

It {{takes its name from}} the rivers Ille and Rance. Several hire firms are based on the canal or its connecting waterways. From Dinan the navigation continues in the semi-tidal river Rance for a further 6 km to Le Châtelier lock, below which navigation continues in the tidal Rance <b>maritime.</b> The <b>canal</b> has a summit level 7km in length at an altitude of 65m, and in times of drought some restrictions may have to be imposed on the use of locks.|$|R

50|$|The {{first major}} project the {{department}} under Linant (now under his new title as director general) constructed was the Ismailia canal.

50|$|The Brussels-Charleroi Canal, {{also known}} as the Charleroi Canal amongst other similar names, (canal Bruxelles-Charleroi, kanaal Brussel-Charleroi) is an {{important}} canal in Belgium. The canal is quite large, with a Class IV Freycinet gauge, and its Wallonian portion is 47.9 km long. It runs from Charleroi in the south to Brussels in the north. It is part of a north-south axis of water transport in Belgium, whereby the north of France (via the Canal du Centre) including Lille and Dunkirk and important waterways in the south of Belgium including the Sambre valley and sillon industriel are linked to the port of Antwerp in the north, via the Brussels-Scheldt <b>Maritime</b> <b>Canal</b> which meets the Brussels-Charleroi Canal at the Sainctelette area.|$|E
50|$|In early January 1939, Bonnet and Daladier {{approved}} {{of the idea of}} sending the banker Paul Baudoin as an unofficial diplomat to find out just what exactly the Italians wanted from France. The reasoning for the Baudoin mission was if the price of Italian friendship was not too expensive, it might be worth paying as a way of detaching Italy from Germany, thus reducing France's potential enemies. When Baudoin visited Rome in February 1939, he reported that the Italians were asking for only some economic concessions from the French in the Horn of Africa and Italian representation {{on the board of the}} Compagnie universelle du <b>canal</b> <b>maritime</b> de Suez.|$|R
5000|$|Suez was (and remains, through GDF Suez) one of {{the oldest}} {{continuously}} existing multinational corporations in the world, with one line of corporate history dating back to the 1822 founding of the [...] (literally: General Dutch Company for the favouring of industry) by King William I of the Netherlands (see Société Générale de Belgique). Its form prior to the GDF merger was the result of nearly two centuries of reorganisation and corporate mergers.

50|$|The Compagnie universelle du <b>canal</b> <b>maritime</b> de Suez was {{organized}} {{at the end}} of 1858. On 25 April 1859 the first blow of the pickaxe was given by de Lesseps at Port Said. During the following ten years, de Lesseps had to overcome the continuing opposition of the British government preventing the Sultan from approving the construction of the canal, and at one stage he even had to seek the support of his cousin, Empress Eugenie, to persuade the Emperor Napoleon III to act as arbitrator in the disputes. Finally, on 17 November 1869, the canal was officially opened by the Khedive, Ismail Pasha.|$|R
