METHODS: The pharmacokinetic properties of oral artesunate and artemether (4 mg kg(- 1)) were compared in a randomized cross-over study of 14 adult patients in western Thailand with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Antimalarial activity was compared using a previously validated, sensitive bioassay. RESULTS: Despite a 29 % lower <b>molar</b> <b>dose,</b> oral artesunate administration resulted in significantly larger mean area under the plasma antimalarial activity time curve and median maximum plasma antimalarial activity than after oral artemether (P <or= 0. 02). The mean (95 % CI) oral antimalarial bioavailability of artemether, relative to oral artesunate, corrected for <b>molar</b> <b>dose</b> was 58 (40 - 76) %.

40|$|Almost 40 years ago, it was {{reported}} that cattle-feed which had been extracted with hot trichloroethylene and then fed to calves produced renal injury and a fatal aplastic anaemia. The toxic factor was subsequently identified as S-(1, 2 -dichlorovinyl) -L-cysteine (DCVC). These original findings have been confirmed, a single intravenous dose of DCVC at 4 mg/kg, or 0. 4 mg/kg intravenously per day administered for 10 days to calves produced aplastic anaemia, and renal injury after a single dose of 4 mg/kg. The toxicity to calves of a number of other haloalkene cysteine conjugates has been examined to ascertain whether, like DCVC, they produce bone marrow and renal injury. Intravenous administration of the N-acetyl cysteine conjugate of DCVC produced renal but not bone marrow injury at a <b>molar</b> equivalent <b>dose</b> to DCVC, indicating that the calf can deacetylate the mercapturic acid and further that sufficient chemical had reached the kidney to be a substrate for the enzyme cysteine conjugate β-lyase. However, intravenous administration of the α-methyl analogue of DCVC, which cannot undergo metabolism via the enzyme cysteine conjugate β-lyase, was without toxicity at doses about five-fold higher than DCVC. These latter findings provide strong evidence that metabolism of DCVC via the enzyme β-lyase is necessary for bone marrow and renal injury to occur. The cysteine conjugates of perchloroethylene and hexachloro- 1, 3 -butadiene(HCBD) when given intravenously to calves at <b>molar</b> equivalent <b>doses</b> to DCVC, or above, did not produce either bone marrow or renal injury. In contrast, intravenous administration of the cysteine conjugate of tetrafluoroethylene (TFEC) produced severe renal tubular injury in calves without affecting the bone marrow. In vitro studies with these haloalkene cysteine conjugates showed, like DCVC, that they were good substrates for calf renal cysteine conjugate β-lyase and toxic to renal cells as judged by their ability to reduce organic anion and cation transport by slices of calf renal cortex and inhibit the renal enzyme glutathione reductase. Calves were also dosed either orally or intravenously with HCBD to assess its toxicity. HCBD at higher <b>molar</b> equivalent <b>doses</b> than DCVC produced mid-zonal necrosis in the liver, renal tubular- necrosis but no bone marrow injury in calves. The key findings emerging from these studies are (I) that none of the other cysteine conjugates, at <b>molar</b> equivalent <b>doses</b> to DCVC and above, produce bone marrow injury in calves, (2) TFEC produced only renal injury, suggesting that sufficient of the other conjugates had not reached the kidney for metabolism by β-lyase to produce cytotoxicity and (3) that HCBD itself is more toxic than its cysteine or mercapturic acid conjugate, suggesting that pharmacokinetics and disposition are important factors in determining the toxicity of these conjugates to calves.

Materials and methods Hypothyroidism was induced with methimazole sodium and perchlorate treatment. Six groups with eight animals were studied: control group (C), hypothyroid group without treatment (HYPO); hypothyroidism treated with physiological doses of tetraiodothyronine (T 4) or 10 times higher (10 &# 215;T 4); hypothyroidism treated with equal <b>molar</b> <b>doses</b> of GC- 1 (GC- 1) or 10 times higher (10 &# 215;GC- 1). After eight weeks, each animal underwent an exercise tolerance test by measuring the time (seconds), in which the rats were swimming with a load attached to their tails without being submerging for more than 10 sec. After the test, the animals were killed, and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis, and the heart and soleus muscle were removed for weighing and morphometric analysis of the cardiomyocyte. Results Hypothyroidism significantly reduced tolerance to exercise and, treatment with GC- 1 1 &# 215; or T 4 in physiological doses recover tolerance test to normal parameters. However, high doses of T 4 also decreased tolerance to physical exercise. Conversely, ten times higher doses of GC- 1 did not impair tolerance to exercise. Interestingly, hypothyroidism, treated or not with T 4 in a physiological range, GC- 1 or even high doses of GC- 1 (10 X) did not change cardiomyocyte diameters and relative weight of the soleus muscle. In contrast, higher doses of T 4 significantly increased cardiomyocyte diameter and induced atrophy of the soleus muscle.

40|$|Abstract Background Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), {{a product}} of the {{cyclooxygenase}} (COX) reaction, stimulates the growth of colonic epithelial cells. It is inferred that the abrogation of prostaglandins' growth-promoting effects as a result of COX inhibition underlies the advantageous effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Despite this appreciation, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure since cell culture studies have yielded discrepant results regarding PGE 2 's mitogenicity. Methods We have employed several alternative approaches to score cell proliferation and apoptosis of 4 CRC cell lines exposed to PGE 2 under various conditions. To investigate the role of cAMP in PGE 2 's functions, activation of the cAMP pathway was assessed at different levels (changes in cAMP levels and PKA activity) in cells subjected to specific manipulations including the use of specific inhibitors or prostanoid receptor-selective agonists/antagonists. Results Our data document that the dose-response curve to PGE 2 is 'bell-shaped', with nano molar concentrations of PGE 2 being more mitogenic than micro <b>molar</b> <b>doses.</b> Remarkably, mitogenicity inversely correlates with the ability of PGE 2 doses to raise cAMP levels. Consistent with a major role for cAMP, cAMP raising agents and pertussis toxin revert the mitogenic response to PGE 2. Accordingly, use of prostanoid receptor-selective agonists argues for the involvement of the EP 3 receptor and serum deprivation of HT 29 CRC cells specifically raises the levels of Gi-coupled EP 3 splice variants. Conclusion The present data indicate that the mitogenic action of low PGE 2 doses in CRC cells is mediated via Gi-proteins, most likely through the EP 3 receptor subtype, and is superimposed by a second, cAMP-dependent anti-proliferative effect at higher PGE 2 doses. We discuss how these findings contribute to rationalize conflictive literature data on the proliferative action of PGE 2. </p...|$|R
30|$|Two primary PK {{parameters}} {{were used}} to assess the bioequivalence of the Test versus the Reference formulations of fingolimod, and {{no significant differences were found}} between the two products in terms of Cmax or AUC 0 – 72. Both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and EMA have provided definitions of bioequivalence in comparing two products containing the same active compounds, and have also provided guidance regarding the parameters that should be employed in measuring bioequivalence. The FDA describes bioequivalence as the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to which the Test and Reference formulations, “become available at the site of drug action when administered at the same <b>molar</b> <b>dose</b> under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study” (FDA/CDER 2003). The EMA considers two comparator agents as bioequivalent, “if they are pharmaceutically equivalent or pharmaceutical alternatives and their bioavailabilities (rate and extent) after administration in the same <b>molar</b> <b>dose</b> lie within acceptable predefined limits” (EMA 2010). Both the FDA and EMA recommend the use of a crossover study design (FDA/CDER 2003; EMA 2010), with the EMA specifying a randomized, two-period, two-sequence, single-dose design. The defined parameters for evaluation of bioequivalence are similar for both agencies. The EMA specifies the parameters as being AUC, Cmax, and Tmax (EMA 2010). The FDA also identifies AUC, Cmax, and Tmax as the relevant parameters, and further states that, for long half-life drugs that demonstrate low intra-subject variability in distribution and clearance, an “AUC truncated at 72 hours (AUC 0 - 72) can be used in place of AUC 0 -t or AUC 00 -∞” (FDA/CDER 2003). The present study has observed all of these criteria and used the recommended study design. In employing a 42 -day washout period, the study has also observed the FDA recommendation that washout periods be at least 5 times the compounds’ half-lives (FDA/CDER 2003; David et al. 2012).

40|$|Abstract Background Poly(ADP-ribose) is a NAD + -requiring, DNA-repairing, enzyme {{playing a}} central role in {{pancreatic}} β-cell death and in the development of endothelial dysfunction in humans and experimental animals. PARP activation is also relevant to the development of complications of diabetes. Hence, agents capable of inhibiting PARP may be useful in preventing the development of diabetes and in slowing down complications of diabetes. Methods PARP inhibition was assessed with a colorimetric assay kit. Molecular docking studies on the active site of PARP were conducted using the crystalline structure of the enzyme available as Protein Data Bank Identification No. 1 UK 1. Type 2 diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats with streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg, i. p.). The test compounds (3 -aminobenzamide = 3 -AB, nicotinamide = NIC, taurine = TAU) were given by the i. p. route 45 min before STZ at 2. 4 mM/kg (all three compounds) or 1. 2 and 3. 6 mM/kg (only NIC and TAU). Blood samples were collected at 24 hr after STZ and processed for their plasma. The plasma samples were used to measure glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and glutathione levels using reported methods. Results 3 -AB, NIC and TAU were able to inhibit PARP, with the inhibitory potency order being 3 -AB>NIC>>TAU. Molecular docking studies at the active site of PARP showed 3 -AB and NIC to interact with the binding site for the nicotinamide moiety of NAD + and TAU to interact with the binding site for the adenine moiety of NAD +. While STZ-induced diabetes elevated all the experimental parameters examined and lowered the insulin output, a pretreatment with 3 -AB, NIC or TAU reversed these trends to a significant extent. At a dose of 2. 4 mm/kg, the protective effect decreased in the approximate order 3 -AB>NIC≥TAU. The attenuating actions of both NIC and TAU were dose-related except for the plasma lipids since NIC was without a significant effect at all doses tested. Conclusions At equal <b>molar</b> <b>doses,</b> 3 -AB was generally more potent than either TAU or NIC as an antidiabetogenic agent, but the differences were not as dramatic as would have been predicted from their differences in PARP inhibitory potencies. NIC and TAU demonstrated dose-related effects, which in the case of TAU were only evident at doses ≥ 2. 4 mM/kg. The present results also suggest {{that in the case of}} NIC and TAU an increase in dose will enhance the magnitude of their attenuating actions on diabetes-related biochemical alterations to that achieved with a stronger PARP inhibitor such as 3 -AB. Hence, dosing will play a critical role in clinical studies assessing the merits of NIC and TAU as diabetes-preventing agents. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTGFBI, a {{transforming}} {{growth factor}} β-induced extracellular matrix protein, circulates {{at a level}} of ~ 300 ng/ml in humans and modulates several integrin-mediated cellular functions. The protein contains an N-terminal EMI domain, four consecutive FAS 1 domains, and the RGD motif. Each FAS 1 domain and the RGD motif have been known to interact with avb 3 integrin. Here, we found that the binding affinity (Kd) of TGFBI for αvβ 3 integrin was approximately 3. 8 × 10 − 8 M, a value ~ 2300 -fold higher than that of a single FAS 1 domain, and demonstrated that this greater affinity was due to the cooperative action of the four FAS 1 domains and the RGD motif. Moreover, TGFBI exhibited more potent anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic activities, even at a 100 -fold lower <b>molar</b> <b>dose</b> than the reported effective dose of the FAS 1 domain. Finally, our data showed that TGFBI specifically targeted the tumor vasculature and accumulated at the tumor site. Collectively, our results support the theory that TGFBI acts as a potent endogenous anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic molecule by targeting αvβ 3 integrin, and highlights the importance of physiological circulating TGFBI levels in inhibiting tumor growth...|$|E
40|$|Ampakine {{compounds}} {{have been}} shown to reverse opiate-induced respiratory depression by activation of amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptors. However, their pharmacological exploitations are hindered by low blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and limited brain distribution. Here, we explored whether thiamine disulfide prodrugs with the ability of “lock-in” can be used to solve these problems. A series of thiamine disulfide prodrugs 7 a– 7 f of ampakine compound LCX 001 was synthesized and evaluated. The trials in vitro showed that prodrugs 7 e, 7 d, 7 f possessed a certain stability in plasma and quickly decomposed in brain homogenate by the disulfide reductase. In vivo, prodrug 7 e decreased the peripheral distribution of LCX 001 and significantly increased brain distribution of LCX 001 after i. v. administration. This compound showed 2. 23 - and 3. 29 -fold greater increases in the AUC 0 -t and MRT 0 -t of LCX 001 in brain, respectively, than did LCX 001 itself. A preliminary pharmacodynamic study indicated that the required <b>molar</b> <b>dose</b> of prodrug 7 e was only one eighth that of LCX 001 required to achieve the same effect in mice. These findings provide an important reference to evaluate the clinical outlook of ampakine compounds...|$|E
30|$|In {{the last}} part of this study, the {{efficacy}} of TO to enhance the uptake of [111 In-DOTA]MG 11 specifically in human CCK 2 R(+)-expressing tumors was compared vs. PA at progressively increasing administered doses in mice bearing double A 431 -CCK 2 R(+/−) tumors (Table  2, Fig.  4). While both NEP inhibitors induced significant and CCK 2 R-specific tumor uptake enhancement even at the lowest administered doses (1.5  μg TO and 3  μg PA), PA showed consistently superior efficacy at all tested dose levels compared to TO (P[*]<[*] 0.001). Remarkably, PA reached maximum tumor uptake enhancement at the 30  μg dose already, whereas TO reached half as high tumor values at the corresponding 10 -fold <b>molar</b> <b>dose</b> of 150  μg. These intriguing findings may be tentatively assigned to the free thiol functionality of TO (Fig.  1). This strong nucleophile is prone to interact in vivo with electrophiles, and hence, the effective dose of TO might be much lower than originally anticipated. In fact, previous reports have demonstrated the fast in vivo inactivation of thiol-based NEP inhibitors, including TO [33, 34]. Another practical disadvantage of thiols is their propensity to oxidize in aqueous solutions to the respective disulfides, and hence, their storage for longer time periods in ready to use formulations for clinical application becomes challenging.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To compare patient-controlled {{sedation}} with 1 -mg increments of midazolam at 1 -min intervals with 0. 1 -mg increments of midazolam {{without a}} lock-out interval.

Results: <b>Doses</b> of midazolam obtained, degree of sedation and operating conditions {{were similar in}} the two groups. The demands far exceeded the increments actually received by patients obtaining 0. 1 -mg increments. Some were extremely sedated with both techniques. Conclusions: In this age group, {{there were no significant}} advantages or disadvantages of one technique over the other. Patients obtained the degree of sedation they required to undergo the operation by pressing the button independently of the dose or incremental interval. So-called ‘true’ patient-controlled sedation is a misnomer. The cut-off interval proved to be an extremely important safety feature...|$|R
40|$|N-methyi-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (nitrosoguanidine) and to {{a lesser}} extent UV {{radiation}} are very mutagenic for Gibberella microconidia. The recommended nitrosoguanidine doses lead to much higher frequencies of mutants than are found in other microorganisms.

40|$|Estrogenic {{activity}} of diphenylethanes and -ethenes was detd. by uterine growth in immature mice and analyzed by weighed regression of logit-transformed effect on log dose values. This {{resulted in a}} range of Hill coeffs. nH from 0. 3 to 2 corresponding to the mol. mechanism of estrogenic transcriptional activation. Binding of agonists (hormones, H) to estrogen receptors (ER) leads to receptor dimerization depending on the structure of the ligand. Three hormone-receptor complexes, H-ER, H-ER-ER, and H-ER-ER-H, which bind with different affinity to short palindromic DNA sequences (estrogen responsive elements), can be proposed. Transcriptional activating functions of the DNA-bound ER are subsequently induced. The authors have derived an equil. model including these steps. Computer simulations of Hill plots based on the model have completely reproduced the range of obsd. nH values. Hill coeffs. are > 1. 5 if the homodimer H-ER-ER-H and < 0. 7 if the heterodimer H-Er-ER strongly predominates. If ER dimerization is disturbed (H-ER monomer predominant), nH is closer to 1. Hill coeffs. and pD 2 values (neg. decadic logarithms of <b>molar</b> estrogen <b>doses</b> causing 50 % of the maximal effects) are related to parameters of ER dimerization and the two steps of hormone-receptor dissocn. When a series of 1, 2 -bis(3 '- or 4 '-hydroxyphenyl) ethanes and -ethenes is studied, a rather simple dependence of nH and pD 2 on the nature of alkyl groups sym. substituted at C-atoms 1 and 2 can be obsd. In terms of the model this implies that Et and a-branched higher alkyl substituents (nH. mchgt. 1) appear to stabilize the homodimer, while Me and CF 3 groups (nH. mchlt. 1) could lead to a rapid dissocn. of the homodimer to the heterodimer. With longer n-alkyl and b-branched alkyl substitution (nH from 0. 66 to 1. 3), dimerization itself can be limited or the ligand-homodimer dissocn. is only moderately increased. Thus, a strong sterical constraint could exist with respect to the stabilization of the second ligand-receptor bond in the homodimer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Neuregulin- 1 (NRG 1) is a well-recognized risk {{gene for}} {{schizophrenia}} {{and is often}} implicated in the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of this illness. Alternative splicing and proteolytic processing of the NRG 1 gene produce more than 30 structural variants; however, the neuropathological roles of individual variants remain to be characterized. On {{the basis of the}} neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia, we administered eNRG 1 (0. 1 ~ 1. 0 μg/g), a core epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domain common for all splicing NRG 1 variants, to neonatal mice and compared their behavioral performance with mice challenged with a full mature form of type 1 NRG 1 variant. During the neonatal stage, recombinant eNRG 1 protein administrated from the periphery passed the blood-brain barrier and activated its receptor (ErbB 4) in the brain. In adults, the mice receiving the highest dose exhibited lower locomotor activity and deficits in prepulse inhibition and tone-dependent fear learning, although the hearing reduction of the eNRG 1 -treated mice may explain these behavioral deficits. Neonatal eNRG 1 treatment also significantly potentiated MK- 801 -driven locomotor activity in an eNRG 1 dose-dependent manner. In parallel eNRG 1 treatment enhanced MK- 801 -driven c-Fos induction and decreased immunoreactivity for NMDA receptor subunits in adult brain. In contrast, mice that had been treated with the same <b>molar</b> <b>dose</b> of a full mature form of type 1 NRG 1 as neonates did not exhibit hypersensitivity to MK- 801. However, both animal models exhibited similar hypersensitivity t...|$|E
40|$|C 75, a {{recently}} derived compound that potently suppresses feeding and induces weight loss, {{has been proposed}} to act mainly by inhibiting fatty acid synthase (FAS) in central neurons that control feeding. For example, normal, fasting- associated, hypothalamic increases in neuropeptide Y (NPY) /Agouti-related protein (AGRP) expression and decreases in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) /cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) expression were reported to be blocked by C 75. Using loose-patch extracellular recording in acute slices, we tested the effect of C 75 on anorexigenic POMC neurons and orexigenic NPY neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, which were identified by promoter-driven GFP expression, {{as well as on}} feeding-unrelated cerebellar Purkinje neurons. We expected C 75 to activate POMC neurons, inhibit NPY neurons, and have no effect on Purkinje neurons. Instead, C 75 activated all cell types, suggesting that it lacks target specificity. This activation was probably not caused by FAS inhibition, because the classical FAS inhibitor, cerulenin, did not have this effect when tested on POMC and NPY neurons. Nonspecific neuronal activation and resulting neurological effects might contribute to the decreased feeding reported to follow centrally administered C 75. Injection, ip, of C 75 induced severe loosening or liquefaction of stools, weight loss, and decreased food intake in both wild-type and melanocortin- 4 receptor knockout mice. In contrast, cerulenin failed to loosen stools, even at a <b>molar</b> <b>dose</b> over 9 -fold greater than C 75, and had a much smaller effect on body weight. FAS inhibitory activity, by itself, seems to be insufficient to reproduce all of the effects of ip-injected C 75...|$|E
40|$|GW 433908 is the water-soluble, {{phosphate}} ester prodrug {{of the human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease inhibitor amprenavir (APV). A high-yield synthesis of GW 433908 is achieved by phosphorylation of the penultimate precursor of APV with phosphorous oxychloride (POCl 3) in pyridine. A single-dose pharmacokinetic study of GW 433908 sodium salt in dogs showed that APV exposure {{was similar to that}} achieved with an equivalent <b>molar</b> <b>dose</b> of the APV clinical formulation (Agenerase) and that systemic exposure to the prodrug was minimal (0. 3 % of the APV exposure). However, the sodium salt of GW 433908 was a hygroscopic, amorphous solid and thus not suitable for pharmaceutical development. The calcium salt was a developable crystalline solid, but oral dosing afforded only 24 % of the APV exposure in dogs compared with Agenerase. Acidification of the dog stomach by coadministration of HCl increased the bioavailability of the calcium salt to levels near those of the sodium salt. Single-dose administration of GW 433908 calcium salt in dogs and rats produced portal vein GW 433908 concentrations that were maximally 1. 72 and 0. 79 % of those of APV concentrations, respectively. Furthermore, GW 433908 had poor transepithelial flux and APV showed significant flux across human-derived Caco- 2 cell monolayers (a model of intestinal permeability). Taken together, these results suggest that GW 433908 is primarily metabolized to APV at or in the epithelial cells of the intestine and that the prodrug is not substantially absorbed. Based in part on these findings, GW 433908 was advanced to clinical development...|$|E
40|$|The alkyl esters of {{p-hydroxybenzoic}} acid known as parabens (Pbens) {{are used as}} preservatives in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations. They have been reported as estrogenic.

Estrogenicity was studied using the uterotrophic assay in immature (Im) and adult ovariectomized (Ovx) CD 1 mice, and in immature female Wistar rats (IW). Animals were subcutaneously (sc) treated for three consecutive days with different <b>molar</b> equivalent <b>doses</b> ranging from 3. 62 to 1086 mmol/kg body weight of Pbens, E 2 (0. 036 mmol/kg), or vehicle. Pbens increased uterine weight in Im and Ovx animals and their relative uterotrophic effect to E 2 (100) (RUEE 2) were from 34 to 91. The relative uterotrophic potencies related to E 2 (100) (RUPE 2) of these compounds were from 0. 003 to 0. 007. The E 2 ED 50 for CD 1 animals able to increase the uterine weight was 7 mg/kg (0. 9 / 55 confidence limits); and that of Pbens ranged from 18 to 74 mg/kg. In IW rats, the ED 50 were from 33 to 338 mg/kg. All Pbens, except MePb, competed with [3 H]E 2 for the estrogen receptor binding sites. The uterotrophic effects of Pbens in Im mice have a positive correlation with the side-chain length of the ester group of these compounds. The E 2 and Pbens relative binding affinities (RBA) and Ki values correlated to their estrogenic activity. The NOELs values for Pbens uterotrophic activity in Im were from 0. 6 to 6. 5 mg/kg per day; and Ovx from 6 to 55 mg/kg. The NOELs IW ranged from 16. 5 to 70 mg/kg indicating that Im were more susceptible than Ovx and IW to these effects. The data shown here confirm the estrogenicity o...|$|R
40|$|The {{head of a}} human cadaver was {{positioned}} in a Cranex TOME multifunctional unit (Orion Corporation Soredex, Helsinki, Finland) to measure the organ radiation doses after tomographic examinations of {{the upper and lower}} edentulous jaw bone. Five consecutive examinations were carried out in the upper and lower anterior jaw regions to cover the entire frontal area, 2 in the upper and lower left premolar regions, and 3 and 4 in the upper and lower left molar regions, respectively. Each examination consisted of 4 slices with a 2 mm slice thickness. Thermoluminescent dosimeter chips were placed in the thyroid gland and bilaterally in the parotid and submandibular glands. Dosimetric measurements were repeated for the different tomographic examinations mentioned above. For spiral tomography in the maxilla, organ doses for both parotid glands were most elevated, while those for the thyroid glands were the lowest. Average doses per examination reached levels of 0. 27 mGy for the right (OS) parotid gland with frontal tomography, and 3. 89 mGy and 1. 67 mGy for the parotid gland at tube-side (TS) for premolar and molar tomography. For the thyroid gland, a minimal dose of < or = 0. 004 mGy was noticed for all examinations. For spiral tomography of the frontal area in the mandible, the OS parotid gland received the highest dose (0. 77 mGy), while for an analysis of the premolar and <b>molar</b> areas, <b>doses</b> were more elevated for the TS parotid gland (1. 22 mGy and 1. 72 mGy, respectively). For the TS submandibular gland, organ doses were also raised, with values of 0. 39 mGy for frontal, 1. 31 mGy for premolar and 1. 61 mGy for molar tomography. This study thus indicates that for conventional spiral tomographic examinations in the maxilla and the mandible, radiation doses for the TS submandibular and parotid glands were significantly more elevated than those to the thyroid gland. These values remain however below the organ doses previously reported for spiral CT involving both a full upper or lower jaw. status: publishe...|$|R

Different interactions may be related to chemical compound, but this has not been systematically examined. Our goal was to assess the interactive effects between the two elements on growth in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, focusing on inorganic and organic Hg (HgCl 2 and MeHgCl) and Se (selenomethionine, sodium selenite, and sodium selenate) compounds. We utilized aqueous Hg/Se <b>dosing</b> <b>molar</b> ratios that were either above, below, or equal to 1 and measured the internal nematode total Hg and Se concentrations for the highest concentrations of each Se compound. Observed interactions were complicated, differed between Se and Hg compounds, and included greater-than-additive, additive, and less-than-additive growth impacts. Biologically significant interactions were only observed when the dosing Se solution concentration was 100 - 25, 000 times greater than the dosing Hg concentration. Mitigation of growth impacts was not predictable on the basis of internal Hg/Se molar ratio; improved growth was observed at some internal Hg/Se molar ratios both above and below 1.
