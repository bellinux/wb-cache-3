5|$|The merle Pomeranian is {{a recent}} color {{developed}} by breeders. It {{is a combination of}} a solid base color with lighter blue/grey patch which gives a <b>mottled</b> <b>effect.</b> The most common base colors for the effect are red/brown or black, although it can also appear with other colors. Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In addition, the eye, nose and paw pad are marshmallow color, changing parts of the eye to blue and the color on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black.|$|E
50|$|Tsugaru wares {{feature a}} {{technique}} supposedly developed by Ikeda Gentarō {{at the end}} of the 17th century; multiple layers of different colored lacquers are used to create a colorful <b>mottled</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
50|$|Layers of {{travertine}} and granite alternate in the masonry, {{creating a}} striped effect. Old photographs show bold red and beige stripes, but the bold {{colors of the}} stone have faded over time, leaving a more <b>mottled</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Mamluks {{utilized}} <b>mottled</b> light <b>effects</b> and chiaroscuro {{in their}} buildings, {{and among the}} architectural elements that complemented it was ablaq. Finely dressed ashlar stones was often combined with brickwork for vaults. These Mamluk and Syrian elements were applied and shared by the Ayyubids and Crusaders in Palestine, Syria, and Egypt.|$|R
50|$|Hughes {{sometimes}} uses colored markers to embellish {{parts of}} a convention sketch, as when he uses red for female characters' lips, or a silver pen to render scenes set in outer space. When rendering an entire sketch in grey tones or full color, Hughes, who once used Prismacolor or Design 2 markers, explained at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International that {{for the past four}} years, he had been using Copic markers, a set of which a fan gave him as a gift, because Copic markers are refillable, and because he found that they produce longer-lasting colors, and can be used several times longer than other brands, as he was still using the same package of nibs as of August 2010 that came with the first set of Copics he was given four years previously. When using Copics, he takes care to erase his pencils, and to not work dark-to-light, because of the <b>mottled</b> <b>effects</b> that result from doing so. He has conducted demonstrations of Copic markers at conventions on a number of occasions.|$|R

5000|$|He {{is mainly}} {{known for his}} highly {{innovative}} etchings, mostly of landscapes, which were often printed on coloured paper or cloth, and with coloured ink, and hand-coloured and often hand-cropped to different sizes. He also made use of drypoint and a form of aquatint {{as well as other}} effects, such as running coarse cloth through the press with the print, for a <b>mottled</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

5000|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, skinheads and punk rockers would spatter bleach on their jeans and battle jackets for a <b>mottled</b> <b>effect</b> similar to camouflage. This early faded look, known as snow wash, tended {{to retain the}} {{original}} dark blue dye around the seams and waistband. One of the first companies to sell [...] "pre washed" [...] jeans (as they were then called), was Guess inc. in 1981. Despite its association with punk fashion, however, the faded effect was copied by many individuals not associated with the subculture, who dipped their jeans in diluted bleach and embellished them with metal studs, embroidery and rhinestones.|$|E
2500|$|The EM IIA and IIB Vasiliki Ware, {{named for}} the Minoan site in eastern Crete, has <b>mottled</b> glaze <b>effects,</b> early {{experiments}} with controlling color, but the elongated spouts drawn from the body and ending in semicircular spouts show {{the beginnings of the}} tradition of Minoan elegance ( [...] , [...] ). The mottling was produced by uneven firing of the slip-covered pot, with the hottest areas turning dark. Considering that the mottling was controlled into a pattern, touching with hot coals was probably used to produce it. The effect was paralleled in cups made of mottled stone.|$|R
50|$|Most metal {{pipes in}} a pipe organ are of varying amounts of a tin/lead alloy, with 50/50 {{being the most}} common. The amount of tin in the pipe defines the pipe's tone, since tin has a {{desirable}} tonal resonance. When a tin/lead alloy cools, the lead cools slightly faster and produces a <b>mottled</b> or spotted <b>effect.</b> This metal alloy {{is referred to as}} spotted metal. Major advantages of using tin for pipes include its appearance, its workability, and resistance to corrosion.|$|R
50|$|The {{album was}} {{available}} with two covers upon its original LP release. The alternate cover uses the back image {{for the front}} and vice versa. It also moves the Simple Minds logo {{to the right of}} the cover. The two cover images fit together when placed side by side or above each other, and the release of the album in British record shops saw the two covers placed in a grid, alternating like the two colours on a chessboard. The album cover was standardised for the original CD release and this version has since been used for the various reissues of the album. A collectable picture disc LP was also produced. Housed in a luxury gatefold die-cut sleeve, the record featured the <b>mottled</b> gold <b>effect</b> of the sleeve. A unique lyrics sheet was also packaged in the gatefold. A magnetic jigsaw puzzle was also produced by Virgin Records to promote the album.|$|R
