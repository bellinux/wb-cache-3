500|$|In 2000, Eve was {{challenged}} by Crystal Peoples-Stokes, {{a member of}} Grassroots and the {{majority leader of the}} Erie County Legislature.

[...] Eve responded by summoning political connections including New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, United States Representative Charles B. Rangel, New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Representative <b>Maxine</b> <b>Waters</b> and his son Eric, who was a veteran New York State campaign manager.
