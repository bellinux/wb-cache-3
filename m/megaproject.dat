5|$|The Washington State Transportation Commission began seeking {{alternatives}} for the bridge replacement project in 1997, including a Sand Point crossing and various designs for a parallel replacement span. The alternatives were narrowed to a replacement span, with varying lane widths and configurations for interchanges in Seattle, in 2003. The project's preferred alternative, a replacement span with six lanes and a mixed-use trail, {{was chosen by}} WSDOT in 2011. The $4.56 billion <b>megaproject,</b> which encompasses the SR520 corridor between I-5 and I-405, was funded using a state gas tax and electronic tolls on the floating bridge introduced on December 29, 2011, to repay construction bonds over a 40-year period.|$|E
5|$|According to the Miami Herald the {{financing}} {{structure of the}} plan is notable {{for the amount of}} financial risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it is a waste of taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big Dig, the nickname of a tunnel <b>megaproject</b> in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended up costing $22 billion in cost overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns. They also state that truck traffic is not a problem in Downtown, and that since 1991 car and truck traffic had reduced significantly.|$|E
5|$|The town {{began to}} develop after the {{completion}} of the Okanogan Irrigation Project, which was designed to facilitate farming. At this time, many farmers came to Omak looking for homes. Fruits including apples, berries, peaches, plums and watermelons were cultivated after 1910. Omak served as a census-designated place (CDP) in 1910, and incorporated as a city on February 11, 1911. Omak and Okanogan have shared a rivalry in high school sports. During the Great Depression of 1933, several residents of Omak were forced to work in nearby communities. As a result, the United States Bureau of Reclamation promoted work which was available as part of an improvement project at Grand Coulee Dam in nearby Coulee Dam, which employed approximately 5,000 people between 1933 and 1951 when the <b>megaproject</b> ended. By 1950, the city was home to various buildings and structures including the St. Mary Mission church, which satisfied residential needs.|$|E

Features which distinguish <b>megaprojects</b> from conventional construction projects, i. e. scope, complexity, large involvement of stakeholders, influence upon the environment, and significant risks during project execution are described. Five examples of <b>Megaprojects</b> are comprehensively presented and analysed. Further, application of risks and risk management are presented for mega projects. Risk management and mitigation in <b>Megaprojects</b> are presented and evaluated. The thesis closes with the presentation of three case studies, where the focus is placed to the risk management aspect and project implementation...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} explores {{a theoretical}} and practical paradox in <b>megaprojects.</b> According to transaction cost economics (Williamson, 1975) high uncertainty, high asset specificity, situated knowledge and the high frequency of transactions associated with <b>megaprojects</b> should drive managers to internalise resources. However, evidence from case studies reveals the following paradox: managerial incentives to invest in internal resources through vertical integration are limited because of fixed time horizons; yet, the alternative of outsourcing and contract management through the market mechanism escalates transaction costs. This research therefore seeks to identify how practitioners might improve performance through more efficient engagement {{with each other and}} overcome the technical, psychological and political barriers uncounted in the delivery of <b>megaprojects</b> (Flyvbjerg, 2006). This study also identifies {{the extent to which the}} transaction costs approach applies to temporary governance structures such as mega-projects. At this stage, this paper is mainly theoretical and seeks to provide a conceptual framework for the understanding of <b>megaprojects,</b> as governance structures. After a brief overview of the difference forms of governance associated to organisations (section I), this paper shows that the hybrid form is, to a large extent, the most suited to <b>megaprojects</b> (section II). Yet, the temporary nature of <b>megaprojects</b> as organisations provides distinctive and additional feature to this hybrid form of governance, not initially considered by Williamson's contributions (section III) ...|$|R
