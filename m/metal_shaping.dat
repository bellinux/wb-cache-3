In such a case, the term stamping {{is used in}} order {{to distinguish between the}} deep drawing (radial tension-tangential compression) and stretch-and-bend (along the straight sides) components.

50|$|With {{developments}} in abrasive coating, the sheet material could withstand greater forces and speeds. This allowed {{the production of}} flapwheels for use with high speed angle grinders. These disks were different in format: flatter, like the original rigid angle grinder disks, and with the flaps arranged in a densely overlapped layout rather than radial. The extra lifetime this gave to the disk allowed their use for stock removal and <b>metal</b> <b>shaping,</b> not just finishing and polishing.|$|E
50|$|One {{application}} is for <b>metal</b> <b>shaping</b> or forming. By selectively laser shocking {{areas on the}} surface of metal sheets or plates, or smaller items such as airfoils, the associated compressive residual stresses cause the material to flex in a controllable manner. In this way a particular shape can be imparted to a component, or a distorted component might be brought back into the desired shape. Thus, this process is capable of bringing manufactured parts back into design tolerance limits and form shaping thin section parts.|$|E

After shaping, it is common practice to press and slide sandpaper against the still-spinning object to smooth the surface made with the <b>metal</b> <b>shaping</b> tools. The tool rest is usually removed during sanding, {{as it may be}} unsafe to have the operators hands between it and the spinning wood.|$|E

50|$|Synchronizing {{rings are}} made of metal and can be {{provided}} with anti-wear coatings called a friction lining.Common metals for synchronizer rings are brass and steel. The linings typically consist of molybdenum, iron, bronze or carbon.The synchronizing rings are produced either by massive forming (common forging) or sheet <b>metal</b> <b>shaping.</b> The latter involves the stamping of the blank out of a sheet metal strip and the subsequent machining with follow-on composite tools or transfer tools. A friction lining usually consists of thermally splashed molybdenum. Alternatively, iron or bronze sinter friction layers can be used. Carbon-coated synchronizer rings are particularly wear resistant and offer very good friction behavior. Due to their higher price, these are reserved for high-performance transmissions.|$|E

Diana Muir believes that North's milling machine was online around 1816. Muir, Merritt Roe Smith, and Robert B. Gordon all agree that before 1832 both Simeon North and John Hall were able to mass-produce complex machines with moving parts (guns) using a system that entailed the use of rough-forged parts, with a milling machine that milled the parts to near-correct size, and that were then [...] "filed to gage by hand with the aid of filing jigs." ...|$|E
50|$|Miniature {{models of}} {{automobiles}} {{first appeared in}} Europe around the time real automobiles did. Then, shortly after, they appeared in the United States (Harvey 1974, p. 1995-1996). These were toys and replicas often made of lead and brass (Harvey 1974, p. 1995). Later models made {{in the early twentieth}} century were slush cast plaster or iron. Tin and pressed steel cars, trucks, and military vehicles, like those made by Bing of Germany, were introduced in the 1920s through the 1940s, but period models rarely copied actual vehicles, likely because of the crudeness of early casting and <b>metal</b> <b>shaping</b> techniques (Harvey 1974, p. 1995, 1997). Casting vehicles in various alloys, usually zinc (called zamac or mazac), became popular in the late 1930s and remained prominent after World War II (Earle 2009).|$|E
5000|$|Frame {{designs are}} the most {{significant}} element of this simple device. For the most part wheels have changed very little since the 19th century. The early English machines (as opposed to the American versions), such as Edwards, Kendrick, Brown, Boggs, and Ranalah, etc., had cast iron frames. These wheels, made during the 19th Century, had Babbitt metal plain bearings, making them difficult to push and pull the metal through when operated at high pressures. Later, when ball bearings came into use, the machines became more suitable for hard and thick material, such as 1/8” steel. Despite the advantages of cast iron, it has {{less than half the}} stiffness (Young's modulus) of steel and sometimes must be replaced by steel when a stiffer frame is needed. Steel frames made of solid flame-cut plate, or frames built-up of cut-and-welded plates, are common designs. Steel tubing, generally of square section, has been used for wheeling machine frames during the past 30 years, in the US particularly, where sheet <b>metal</b> <b>shaping</b> has become a hobby as well as a business. Tube-framed machines are reasonably-priced and are available either as kit-built machines or can be built easily from plans. The stiffest tubular frames have a fully triangulated external bracing truss. They are most effective on thinner or softer materials, such as 20 ga steel or [...]063" [...] aluminum. Cast frame machines, like the one pictured, are still available.|$|E

40|$|Manufacturing sector {{nowadays}} has to {{deal with}} the global need to reduce the environmental impact of human activity. As manufacturing accounts for {{a significant portion of the}} global CO 2 emissions, scientific research should be addressed to understand the environmental impact of manufacturing processes and, in the meantime, to take advantage of their full potential in reducing the overall CO 2 emissions. The present review paper aims at describing the role of <b>metal</b> <b>shaping</b> processes in reducing the environmental impact across different stages of metal components life. Actually, an increased consciousness concerning both the environmental performances of manufacturing processes and their potential to enable circular economy practices can uncover and unlock new energy and resource efficiency strategies. Besides the straightforward role in the manufacturing stage, the impact of these processes in others life stages (mainly material production and End-of-life) is analyzed. The review paper aims both at outlining the already developed scientific research in the domain of energy and resource efficiency and at highlighting the role of <b>metal</b> <b>shaping</b> processes in putting in place energy and resource efficient manufacturing strategies. Concerning the unit process level, quantified improvements in environmental indicators with varying processes parameters, machine tools architectures, used process and manufacturing approach itself have been analyzed. As far as material efficiency is concerned, both innovative recycling as well as reuse strategies (remanufacturing, reshape and relocate) implemented by means of <b>metal</b> <b>shaping</b> processes are described. The idea is to provide a comprehensive picture of environmental aspects of <b>metal</b> <b>shaping</b> processes analyzing the developed scientific research, looking at them from a new perspectives and outlining research needs...|$|E

40|$|Metallic {{material}} processing plays {{a significant role}} in terms of global environmental impact. As a result, energy- and resource-efficient strategies in the <b>metal</b> <b>shaping</b> technology domain need to be identified urgently. Recently, the scientific world has been paying more and more attention to the environmental impact analysis of manufacturing processes. Despite this increased attention, {{the state of the art}} in the domain of environmental impact analysis of <b>metal</b> <b>shaping</b> processes is still characterized by gaps in knowledge and in methodologies. In particular, metal forming processes are still not well documented, in terms of their environmental impact, and there is a lack of systematic and comparative approaches. This paper offers a contribution to a better understanding of the environmental impact of forming and machining processes. A thorough methodology has been developed to take into due account all the environmental factors of influence on both of the considered technologies. A comparative analysis has been performed, varying the production batch size and part geometry. The importance of an environmental performance analysis that can include both batch size and geometry variations is discussed and highlighted throughout the paper. Finally, the application of the proposed methodology has resulted in the setting up of an eco-design tool, here defined as a Process Sustainability Diagram (PSD), which allows the greenest technology to be selected for the analyzed case study, while varying the considered factors of influence...|$|E
