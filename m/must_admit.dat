However, this policy {{has come under fire}} by organizations who assert that the Boy Scouts of America do benefit from taxpayer money and thus cannot be called a truly private organization, and thus <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> atheists, and others currently barred from membership.

25|$|The {{argument}} thus {{claims that}} if we find the inverted spectrum plausible, we <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> that qualia exist (and are non-physical). Some philosophers find it absurd that an armchair argument can prove something to exist, and the detailed argument does involve a lot of assumptions about conceivability and possibility, which are open to criticism.

He referred to the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia {{and said they were}} reminders of how “unpredictable” developments in the Middle East were.

On August 7, 1975, U.S. District Court Judge Clarence C. Newcomer ruled that Central <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> academically qualified girls starting in the fall term of 1975. The decision was appealed, and the Third Circuit Court ruled that Central had the right to retain its present status. The case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court that, on April 19, 1977, upheld the Third Circuit Court's verdict by a 4 to 4 vote with one abstention.|$|E

25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E

[...] Bleacher Report's Dilan Ames stated that although Cutler is the better quarterback, his injury tendencies and inability to play a full season since 2009 had affected him, along with the statistics comparison between the two quarterbacks: Cutler has recorded 1,908 yards, 13 touchdowns and eight interceptions, while McCown has thrown for 1,809 yards, 13 touchdowns and one interception.

[...] At the fourth Nokia Music Connect video conference, Chopra said that the commercial numbers for [...] "In My City" [...] were all the more surprising, since the music sales in the Indian market is not that much. Universal Music MD, India, Saarc Devraj Sanyal said that the label was surprised with the instant sales of the song. [...] "We have been in the non-film music business for a while and I <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> to mounting engines across all platforms that have been fired like never before on Priyanka's global single debut.

IGN's Matt Wales rated [...] "The Vampires of Venice" [...] 7 out of 10, saying that it [...] "had plenty of standout moments, even if it didn't quite manage to come together to form a completely satisfying whole". He praised the comedy between Amy and Rory and McCrory's acting, as well as the location shots and Croatia and thought [...] "the sci-fi retcon of classic vampire phenomenon was particularly clever", believing that the aliens went beyond two-dimensional. However, he agreed with Fuller and Mulkern that [...] "its single biggest problem was one of over-familiarity", with many misplaced alien races having featured before.|$|E

She appraised of her screen debut: [...] "it {{was a wonderful}} experience {{for me to be}} appearing alongside so many established names. It was very exciting although I <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> at first I was a bit daunted by the prospect." [...] The film featured several minor black characters, either as members of Gabriel's family, or as workers aboard the ship. When these roles were cast, complaints were made by black members of the British actors' union to the BBC and the Department of Employment at having been [...] "passed over" [...] in favour of overseas artists. The film was shot from 23 September to 6 November 1992. It was funded in the most part by the BBC, though a quarter of the budget came from the American Miramax. While Kidron had previously come to dislike directing for major studios when filming My Cousin Vinny for Fox, she found the low budget of Great Moments in Aviation [...] "just as horrendous a compromise". Though originally intended for theatrical release, the film failed to find theatrical distribution. It was first screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1994, then broadcast in Britain on BBC Two on 11 November 1995. It was released on video in the United States under the alternate title Shades of Fear two years later, on 11 November 1997.|$|E

However, {{he found that}} the control system took time to learn, and he stated, [...] "This is not a game you can master quickly or play in a night. It has its frustrations and its flaws, despite its brilliance of design". He summarized that [...] "those who are patient will be richly rewarded with a game like no other." [...] Computer Gaming Worlds Doug Sencat enjoyed the game's graphics and praised the plot, conversations and 3D world for giving a sense of [...] "being there". However, he noted that the game's movement controls were [...] "a pain" [...] and that navigating the environment was initially [...] "frustrating". Sencat was unfavorable toward the linearity of the plot and dialogue trees, and toward NPCs' inability to take actions independent of the player. He described the game as [...] "a long and grueling quest" [...] that often [...] "seems more frustrating than enjoyable". Although Semcat called it [...] "a relatively high-quality game", he finished, [...] "By the time I finally saw daylight again, emerging from the Labyrinth, I <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> that it wasn't exultation I felt, but sheer relief." [...] The magazine's Scorpia was more positive, calling the game [...] "a good follow-up to the previous entry".|$|E
500|$|Now {{he discovers}} that the self he chooses has a {{boundless}} multiplicity within itself inasmuch {{as it has}} a history, a history in which he acknowledges identity with himself. This history is of a different kind, for in this history he stands {{in relation to other}} individuals in the race, and to the whole race, and this history contains painful things, and yet he is the person he is only through this history. That is why it takes courage to choose oneself, for {{at the same time as}} he seems to be isolating himself most radically he is most radically sinking himself into the root by which he is bound up with the whole. This makes him uneasy, and yet it must be so, for when the passion of freedom is aroused in him-and it is aroused in the choice just as it presupposes itself in the choice-he chooses himself and struggles for this possession as for his salvation, and it is his salvation. Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216When a person turns and faces himself in order to understand himself, he steps, as it were, in the way of that first self, halts that which was turned outward in hankering for and seeking after the surrounding world that is its object, and summons it back from the external. In order to prompt the first self to this withdrawal, the deeper self lets the surrounding world remain what it is-remain dubious. This is indeed the way it is; the world around us is inconstant and can be changed into the opposite at any moment, and there is not one person who can force this change by his own might or by the conjuration of his wish. The deeper self now shapes the deceitful flexibility of the surrounding world in such a way that it is no longer attractive to the first self. Then the first self either must proceed to kill the deeper self, to render it forgotten, whereby the whole matter is given up; or it <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> that the deeper self is right, because to want to predicate constancy of something that continually changes is indeed a contradiction, and as soon as one confesses that it changes, it can of course, change in that same moment. However much that first self shrinks from this, there is no wordsmith so ingenious or no thought-twister so wily that he can invalidate the deeper self’s eternal claim. There is only one way out, and that is to silence the deeper self by letting the roar of inconstancy drown it out. Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, 1845, Hong translation, p. 314Just as a man changes his clothes for celebration, so a person preparing for the holy act of confession is inwardly changed. It is indeed like changing one’s clothes to divest oneself of multiplicity in order to make up one’s mind about one thing, to interrupt the pace of busy activity in order to put on the repose of contemplation in unity with oneself. And this unity with oneself is the celebration’s simple festive dress that is the condition of admittance. Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Søren Kierkegaard, 1847, Hong, p.19If a person whose life has been tried in some crucial difficulty has a friend and sometime later he is unable to retain the past clearly, if anxiety creates confusion, and if accusing thoughts assail him with all their might as he works his way back, then he may go to his friend and say, [...] "My soul is sick so that nothing will become clear to me, but I confided everything to you; you remember it, so please explain the past to me again." [...] But if a person has no friend, he presumably goes to God if under other circumstances he has confided something to him, if in the hour of decision he called God as witness when no one understood him. [...] And the one who went to his friend perhaps was not understood at times, perhaps was filled with self-loathing, which is even more oppressive, upon discovering that the one to whom he had confided his troubles had not understood him at all, even though he had listened, had not sensed what was making him anxious, but had only an inquisitive interest in his unusual encounter with life. But this would never happen with God; who would dare to venture to think this of God, even if he is cowardly enough to prefer to forget God-until he stands face-to-face with the judge, who passes judgment on him but not on the one who truly has God as a witness, because where God is the judge, there is indeed no judge if God is the witness. It by no means follows that a person’s life becomes easy because he learns to know God in this way. On the contrary, it can become very hard; it may become more difficult than the contemptible easiness of sensate human life, but in this difficulty life also acquires ever deeper and deeper meaning.
