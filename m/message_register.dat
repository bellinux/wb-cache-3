Recommendations are provided in regard to: - Benefit of a web-based HTML user interface for input/output. - Use of XML to organize/format register applications in a consistent manner. - Having the collection/registration become a JloopK process. - Conforming to ISO standards to organize and manage the Register. - Benefit of a joint IMO-IALA register for both international and regional applications...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to explore the {{characteristics}} of self-improvement books as a genre. Although self-improvement books are a widely read genre, particularly in the Western world, none to my knowledge has examined the linguistic features of this genre in detail. The thesis draws on the three main schools of genre theory: English for Specific Purposes, Systemic Functional Linguistics, and the New Rhetoric, and begins by investigating the sections (e. g., acknowledgement, introduction chapter) in self-improvement books and the typicality of the sections. Focusing on three sections: introduction chapters, body chapters, and about the author sections, the thesis examines how authors structure the sections by analysing the moves and steps. This study also examines the stories in self-improvement books by analysing {{the purpose of the}} stories and their structure. Stories were chosen because they seemed to be a feature of self-improvement books based on my observation and as suggested by interview data. To analyse self-improvement books at a register level, the thesis examines the most unambiguous aspects of engagement: personal pronouns focusing on you, imperative clauses, and questions. It also examines the lexicogrammatical features of self-improvement book titles and compares them to the titles of historical biographies, showing that imperative clauses and ing-clause are found only in self-improvement book titles. Drawing on interview data and literature on the American Dream, American individualism, Neoliberalism, and New Age beliefs, the thesis explains how the linguistic characteristics of the genre of self-improvement books reflect these ideologies. The dataset for the study is 40 self-improvement books, {{selected on the basis of}} a set of criteria that I developed. Subsets were selected from the main dataset for specific analyses. The text analysis part of the study is supplemented by interview data from specialist informants, who come from three categories: readers of the genre, non-readers of the genre, and authors of the genre. Move analysis identifies obligatory rhetorical moves and indicates that the main purposes of introduction chapters and about the author sections are persuading readers to read the book, and establishing credibility, respectively. Authors always persuade readers to read their books by listing reasons to read them. To demonstrate authors’ credibility, they refer to their areas of expertise. Unlike the introduction chapters and about the author sections, the body chapters have more than one obligatory rhetorical move. The body chapters present the problem that readers potentially experience, present the authors’ message, recommend practical applications, and encourage readers to apply them. From a genre perspective, the purpose of all the stories in my analysis is to illustrate the authors’ <b>message.</b> <b>Register</b> analysis, and drawing on interview data, suggests that authors use the personal pronoun you, imperative clauses, and questions to engage readers. The abundance of the personal pronoun you suggests that self-improvement books are a reader-oriented genre. The analysis of the imperative clauses using Halliday’s process types suggests that the main way to improve our lives, the authors recommend, is to change how we think. Finally, my thesis shows that the social purpose of self-improvement books is to help potential readers improve their lives, and the approach of improving one’s life has an individualistic orientation...|$|E

40|$|Cloud Computing {{has emerged}} {{over the past}} few years as a new {{business}} paradigm for providing and obtaining IT services. By hosting and delivering services over the Internet, Cloud Computing allows business owners to focus on strategic projects rather than on managing their datacenters, cutting operational and capital costs. Built upon previous concepts such as Grid, Utility or Autonomic Computing, it meets the increasing requirements of power and mobility in various kinds of applications (websites, email services, office softwares), and particularly those imposing a variable load and needing massive scaling. However, many issues have still to be addressed. Similarly, for the past couple of years, SIP has become the most widely used protocol for VoIP. SIP enables interactive user session that involves multimedia elements by allowing endpoints to exchange <b>messages,</b> <b>register</b> user location and move between networks. SIP servers play an important part as key elements in these networks. The aim of this Technical Report is to offer a better understanding of these two emerging services and a discussion about the way to see both of them as a single service.
