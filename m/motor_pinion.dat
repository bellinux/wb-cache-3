50|$|A {{starter ring}} gear, {{sometimes}} called a starter ring or ring gear, is a {{medium carbon steel}} ring with teeth that is fitted {{on the periphery of}} a flexplate or flywheel of an internal combustion engine, mostly for automotive or aircraft applications. The teeth of the starter ring are driven by the smaller gear (the pinion) of the starter motor. The primary function of the starter ring is to transfer torque from the starter <b>motor</b> <b>pinion</b> to the flywheel or flexplate to rotate the engine to begin the cycle.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Phantom Revolution was {{an unfinished}} semi-automatic paintball marker {{developed during the}} early 1990s. It featured an electrically powered rotary breech which was activated by an on-board computer system and microphone which responded {{to the sound of}} the marker being fired. Another notable innovation in the Revolution was its boltless design. The breech, which rotated on an axis in a similar fashion to that of the cylinder of a revolver, allowed a paintball to be fed into the breech which would then align with the firing chamber, creating a seal. The maximum rate of fire was 7 balls per second, or 14 with a two-hole breech. A few working prototypes were demonstrated at the 1996 National Professional Paintball League World Cup in Orlando, Florida by Mike Casady. However, production was halted indefinitely in 1996 due to a technical problem with the <b>motor</b> <b>pinion</b> drive. Additionally, there were several markers being produced or developed at the time which used a switch for a trigger and a circuit board to control the feed and/or the pneumatic firing sequence such as the Smart Parts Shocker. The sport of paintball saw explosive growth during this decade and as the industry became more lucrative, many patent disputes and lawsuits occurred. CCI effectively sidestepped them by focusing solely on the pump paintball market. All together enough parts for 50 prototypes were fabricated, 12 were assembled, and all but two have been accounted for by Casady.|$|E

The torque is transferred from the motor via the gearbox to the drum shell through a coupling or geared rim attached to the shell or end housing (see photo inset above) ...|$|R

Because they can be installed on a building or structure's exterior {{and there is no}} machine room or hoistway required, they are the most used type of elevator for buildings under construction (to move materials and tools up and down).|$|R
50|$|The {{driving wheel}} is coupled with two gear wheels, and the <b>motor</b> has a <b>pinion</b> on both sides. The taps in the wheel disk are warped about 90 degrees {{against each other}} so that the drive {{imbalance}} can be reduced. This version of the driver was used for greater driving power.|$|R

50|$|Mining {{applications}} {{often require}} high preloads, and joints encounter high dynamic forces, {{which can cause}} joints to loosen. MJTs can keep joints tight on boom points, ring gears, side frames, hoist <b>motors,</b> drag lines, <b>pinion</b> gears, split gears, and excavator bearing caps, because the joint is loaded in pure tension without twisting. Some applications, such as toothed rims, require short bolts - MJTs {{can be useful in}} these applications because they greatly improve the elasticity of the joint.|$|R
5000|$|The Champion Bridge Company was a {{well-known}} builder of truss bridges. [...] The bridge is a truss bridge with an approximately 100-foot span [...] To open the bridge for marine vessels, an electric <b>motor</b> drives a <b>pinion</b> gear which engages {{a ring gear}} {{in the base of}} the bridge. If the electric motor is not working, the bridge can also be opened manually using a large wrench (approx. 8' DEEP socket with an 8' long handle).|$|R
40|$|Damage by {{excessive}} vibration is serious engineering problem in TBM boring process. Dynamic characteristic analysis {{is essential for}} TBM antivibration design. According to TBM horizontal support structure, a dynamic coupling nonlinear model is established, with consideration of time-varying impact load and multicomponent complex relationship from cutter to gripper shoe. A set of field vibration tests is set up to accurately collect data under extreme work conditions; then, field data is collected from Liaoning northwest engineering. Field data is applied to validate simulation model to make sure time-varying damping stiffness, support cylinder stiffness, and the TBM machine stiffness distribution are reasonable. Simulation indicates the weakest part of TBM in axial and torsional DOF is the cylinder hinge and the connection shaft between <b>motor</b> and <b>pinion,</b> and the horizontal and vertical weak parts are bull gear. It also shows that, in normal excavation conditions, the acceleration amplitude of the cutterhead in three directions ranges from 1. 5 [*]g to 2 [*]g. These results provide theoretical basis for the antivibration design and structural optimization of TBM...|$|R
50|$|As {{the truck}} {{features}} a straight-axle arrangement, the TXT-1 is particularly adept at RC-scale rock crawling. In short, the straight-axle system allows the entire axle and chassis to better articulate itself over obstructions while efficiently conforming tire contact patches to the ground. As an aside, the wide gear contact patches and durable axle construction make the TXT-1 a very durable platform for either high-torque crawling applications or overall high-power brushed or brushless applications. The truck performs {{very well with}} no modifications required {{on a variety of}} surfaces, however some choose to lock differentials, change tire and wheel packages, reduce <b>motor</b> shaft-mounted <b>pinion</b> gear tooth count, mount the shock absorbers directly to the chassis and axle (thereby deleting the cantilever assembly), and reducing parts count and relocating electronic components to reduce weight and make the vehicle's weight distribution more advantageous for rock crawling. Advanced setups include cutting the lower portion of the chassis, changing the motor arrangement significantly (single motor setup with an external gear reduction unit), or changing the length of suspension links to modify caster angles and distances between axles and the chassis.|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss a linear {{vibratory}} part feeder for handling brake liners, typical sector-shaped components. Part feeders have been used in the industries for a long time to present the parts in a desired orientation. Berretty et al. (1999) discussed a class of mechanical filters that are capable of removing polygonal sections from the track of the feeder which are referred to as traps. The traps eliminate or reorient the parts until they reach the final desired orientation. A part feeder was developed using traps, to reorient the sector-shaped part to desired orientation. The desired orientation was the most probable natural resting orientation. The trap was mounted on a linear vibratory feeder. The adaptive part feeder developed was capable of identifying the size of the incoming part and adjust the trap to accommodate that. This set-up eliminates the use of different traps for different-sized sector-shaped parts and wastage of productive time in changing the traps for different sizes. A regression model was developed to predict the conveying velocity of part on the feeder. Design/methodology/approach A part feeder was developed using traps, to reorient the sector-shaped part to desired orientation. Acrylic material was found to be suitable for trap compared to aluminium. The adaptive part feeder developed was capable of identifying the size of the incoming part using proximity sensors. Depending on the size of the incoming part, the track width was adjusted dynamically with the help of a stepper <b>motor,</b> rack and <b>pinion</b> arrangement. A regression model was developed to predict the conveying velocity. Findings Typical brake liners in the size range of 40 - 60 mm (radius) were considered for developing the adaptive part feeder. Based on performance studies, the acrylic trap was found better than aluminium traps. The appropriate frequency and amplitude of vibration for maximum conveying velocity of the adaptive part feeder were found experimentally. Regression equation was developed to determine the conveying velocity based on input frequency and amplitude. The regression results were found to be in close agreement with the experimental results. Research limitations/implications The developed part feeder is suitable for handling sector-shaped parts only. Originality/value This paper demonstrates an inexpensive adaptive part feeding device for handling sector-shaped parts which can be extended for handling other asymmetric parts also...|$|R
