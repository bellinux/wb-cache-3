In general, <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> is based on clinician familiarity and institutional preferences, since there is a paucity of evidence indicating that the mode affects clinical outcome. [...] The most frequently used forms of volume-limited mechanical ventilation are intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) and continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV). There have been substantial changes in the nomenclature of mechanical ventilation over the years, but more recently it has become standardized by many respirology and pulmonology groups. [...] Writing a mode is most proper in all capital letters with a dash between the cycle and the strategy (i.e. PC-IMV, or VC-MMV etc.) ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The time-cost {{trade-off}} problem {{addressed by}} CPM-based analytical approaches, assume unlimited {{resources and the}} existence of a continuous time-cost function. However, given the discrete nature of most resources, the activities can often be crashed only stepwise. Activity crashing for discrete time-cost function is also known as the activity <b>modes</b> <b>selection</b> problem in the project management. This problem is known to be NP-hard. Sophisticated optimization techniques such as Dynamic Programming, Integer Programming, Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization have been used for finding efficient solution to activity <b>modes</b> <b>selection</b> problem. The paper presents a simple method that can provide efficient solution to activity <b>modes</b> <b>selection</b> problem for project crashing. Design/methodology/approach: Simulation based method implemented on electronic spreadsheet to determine activity modes for project crashing. The method is illustrated {{with the help of an}} example. Findings: The paper shows that a simple approach based on simple heuristic and deterministic simulation can give good result comparable to sophisticated optimization techniques. Research limitations/implications: The simulation based crashing method presented in this paper is developed to return satisfactory solutions but not necessarily an optimal solution. Practical implications: The use of spreadsheets for solving the Management Science and Operations Research problems make the techniques more accessible to practitioners. Spreadsheets provide a natural interface for model building, are easy to use in terms of inputs, solutions and report generation, and allow users to perform what-if analysis.

Achieving efficient GPU-based intra-mode decisions, however, could be nontrivial for two reasons. First, intra-mode decision tends to be sequential. Specifically, the mode decision of the current block {{would depend on the}} reconstructed data of the neighboring blocks. Therefore, the coding modes of neighboring blocks would need to be computed first before that of the current block can be determined. This dependency poses challenges to GPU-based computation, which relies heavily on parallel data processing to achieve superior speedups. Second, RD-based intra-mode decision may require conditional branchings to determine the encoding bit-rate, and these branching operations may incur substantial performance penalties when being executed on GPUs due to pipeline architectural designs. To address these issues, we analyze the data dependency in intra-mode decision, and propose novel greedy-based encoding orders to achieve highly parallel processing of data blocks. We also prove that the proposed greedy-based orders are optimal in our problem, i. e., they require the minimum number of iterations to process a video frame given the dependency constraints. In addition, we propose a method to estimate the coding rate suitable for GPU implementation. Experimental results suggest our proposed solution can be more than 50 times faster than the previously proposed parallel intra-prediction, since our work can efficiently exploit the massive parallel opportunity in GPUs...|$|R
