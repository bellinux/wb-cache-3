One firebomb was dropped {{on the top floor of}} the castle but failed to explode. In order to preserve the castle complex, substantial repair work was undertaken starting in 1956, with a labor expenditure of 250,000 <b>man-days</b> and a cost of 550 million yen. In January 1995, the city of Himeji was substantially damaged by the Great Hanshin earthquake, but Himeji Castle again survived virtually undamaged, demonstrating remarkable earthquake resistance. Even the bottle of sake placed on the altar at the top floor of the keep remained in place.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the sequencing, {{artificial}} mottes {{had to be}} {{built by}} piling up earth; this work was undertaken by hand, using wooden shovels and hand-barrows, possibly with picks {{as well in the}} later periods. Larger mottes took disproportionately more effort to build than their smaller equivalents, because of the volumes of earth involved. The largest mottes in England, such as Thetford, are estimated to have required up to 24,000 <b>man-days</b> of work; smaller ones required perhaps as little as 1,000. Contemporary accounts talk of some mottes being built in a matter of days, although these low figures have led to suggestions by historians that either these figures were an underestimate, or that they refer to the construction of a smaller design than that later seen on the sites concerned. Taking into account estimates of the likely available manpower during the period, historians estimate that the larger mottes might have taken between four and nine months to build. This contrasted favourably with stone keeps of the period, which typically took up to ten years to build. Very little skilled labour was required to build motte and bailey castles, which made them very attractive propositions if forced peasant labour was available, as was the case after the Norman invasion of England. Where the local workforce had to be paid – such as at Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 using imported labourers – the costs would rise quickly, in this case reaching £20.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{construction}} projects, {{there are}} three basic planning elements: time, cost, and quality. These concepts are in {{a close relationship with}} each other. Labour productivity is also a key concept of construction planning efforts and has a direct interrelationship with the triple constraint mentioned above. The present study reports an investigation of construction labour productivity described as numerical values, i. e. <b>man-day</b> values. First, a general knowledge was given concerning the concept “labour productivity”. Here, the system which is the source of labor productivity rates in Turkey was also introduced and its criticism was carried out. Toward this aim, labour productivity rates of the most fundamental two work items of any construction project (formwork-erecting and reinforcement-fixing) were obtained by means of a questionnaire survey applied to planning engineers, site/project managers, and chief executive officers of about 82 general contractors in the construction industry in Turkey. The results were evaluated by one sample t-test, and hence, today's situation of the construction industry in Turkey regarding labor productivity was displayed by a statistical analysis that compares <b>man-day</b> values in theory and in practice...|$|R
25|$|A {{total of}} 340 cars {{were used in}} the film, and more than 230 cars were {{destroyed}} in the making of the film, including several black Mercedes-Benzes, a Ford Crown Victoria, and a Mitsubishi Montero. The film featured the most expensive car destroyed in the franchise so far: a Lykan HyperSport by W Motors, valued at $3.4 million. The mountain-highway chase scene on Colorado's Monarch Pass proved to be the most damaging sequence with over 40 vehicles being destroyed. Only 10 percent of the action sequences in the film were computer-generated, and even then, much of the CGI was employed simply to erase the wires and other contraptions that were used to film real cars and drivers or to add a background. It took more than 3,500 <b>man-days</b> to complete the various stunts of the film. For safety reasons, stunt coordinator, Joel Kramer said that he doesn't let his drivers go above 50 miles per hour.|$|E

Maya architecture also incorporates various art forms and hieroglyphic texts. Masonry architecture built by the Maya evidences craft specialization in Maya society, centralized organization and the political means to mobilize a large workforce. It is estimated that a large elite residence at Copán required an estimated 10,686 <b>man-days</b> to build, which compares to 67-man-days for a commoner's hut. It is further estimated that 65% of the labour required to build the noble residence was used in the quarrying, transporting, and finishing of the stone used in construction, and 24% of the labour was required for the manufacture and application of limestone-based plaster. Altogether, it is estimated that two to three months were required for the construction of the residence for this single noble at Copán, using between 80 and 130 full-time labourers. A Classic-period city like Tikal was spread over , with an urban core covering [...] The labour required to build such a city was immense, running into many millions of <b>man-days.</b> The most massive structures ever erected by the Maya were built during the Preclassic period.
