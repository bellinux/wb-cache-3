5000|$|If {{the cement}} of the cistern gave way, the {{reservoir}} became useless and was abandoned.

The <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wells</b> and cisterns was generally surrounded by a curb or low wall and closed with a stone, both to prevent accidents and to keep away strangers. If the owner neglected to cover the cistern, and a domestic animal fell into it, the Mosaic law obliged him to pay the price of the animal (Exodus 21:33-34; compare Luke 14:5). Sometimes the stone placed on the orifice was so heavy that one man was unable to remove it (Genesis 29:3). When dry, cisterns were used as dungeons, because, narrowed at the top, like [...] "huge bottles", they left no avenue open for escape (Genesis 37:24; Jeremiah 38:6; 1 Maccabees 7:19). They also offered convenient places for hiding a person from his pursuers (1 Kings 13:6; 2 Kings 17:18).|$|R

60|$|No one spoke, {{and each}} eye was riveted upon the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>well,</b> to read there the story which was soon told.

60|$|He {{came back}} slowly, {{rising out of}} immeasurable deeps toward a distant light which was like the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> a <b>well</b> filled with clouds of misty vapor. Occasionally he saw a brown big hairy face {{floating}} in over this lighted horizon, to smile kindly and go away again. Others came with shaggy beards. He heard a cheery tenor voice which he recognized, and then another face, a big brown smiling face; very lovely it looked now to him-almost as lovely as his wife's, which floated in from the other side.|$|R
50|$|The Itza were {{descended from}} the Ah Itzá Yucatecan Maya lineage; {{historically}} they were an important Mesoamerican people who dominated the Yucatán peninsula in the Post-classic period. The Itza may have originated from the Classic Period city of Motul de San José near lake Peten Itza in Guatemala, migrating to Yucatán during the Maya collapse {{at the end of}} the Classic Period. From their capital at Chichén Itzá, Mexico they established a trade empire reaching as far south as Naco in Honduras.

One of the two semi-cylindrical sides constitutes the reflector, and the other, which is of thick glass, allows the passage of light, which illuminates the strata of earth traversed by the instrument.

60|$|From out <b>of</b> the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>well</b> arose what {{appeared}} to be a solid column of greenish yellow, rising slowly in the air like one of the pillars of Aladdin's palace as it was formed by the genii. The top was rounded, and the sides of this marvelous column, held together only by some mighty force, shone in the moonlight like a polished surface of marble, while all the time it arose inch by inch without fret or check, until the top wavered in the night wind. Then one or two drops could be seen rolling off from the summit, and in an instant the entire appearance changed.|$|R
5000|$|On various dates Lieutenant Eastman, with Captain R. L. J.

German bomb. Two attempts were made to explode this bomb but it failed to detonate; at the third attempt when it was in a most dangerous state, they succeeded in detonating it.On a second occasion, these officers, assisted by a Master Rigger of H.M. Dockyard, succeeded in removing a 400lb. high explosive Italian unexploded bomb which had been under water for a week in a 20ft. deep well inside a house. This bomb, fused at both ends, was in a dangerous state. It had to be raised to the ground floor by means of a gin, tackle, sling and ropes. This operation was doubly dangerous, as: (a) There was a possibility of the sling slipping while the bomb was being hauled up and (b) The bomb was two and half ft. long, the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>well</b> three ft. one inch wide, and for safety the bomb had to be kept horizontal, if possible, and pulled up thus. Lieutenant Eastman assisted the Master Rigger, guided the bomb from the floor <b>of</b> the <b>well,</b> and Captain Jones went to the top to guide it through the opening. They succeeded in getting the bomb out although there was only a six inch clearance as it came through the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>well.</b> London Gazette ...|$|R
