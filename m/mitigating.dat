40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the fish {{communities}} in <b>mitigated</b> and natural mangrove areas in the Port Everglades estuary. This study of fish recolonization of recently (ca. 5 years) planted mangrove forests, tested the null hypothesis that the species composition, size distribution and abundance of fish collected in natural, established and <b>mitigated</b> mangrove environments were the same. Two natural mangrove areas and two <b>mitigated</b> mangrove areas were used as study sites in John U. Lloyd Park. Two natural mangrove areas and two <b>mitigated</b> mangrove areas were used as study sites in West Lake Park. A variety of sampling gear types were utilized in the collection of fishes. Sampling was only done at low tide for all areas. Differences (chi square) in the abundances of fishes occurred between the natural mangrove sites in John U. Lloyd and West Lake Parks. These differences are thought to be due largely to differences in the hydrodynamic environment (i. e. tidal flushing, discharge rates of waterflow) and seasonality (i. e. month). However, differences between the fish communities in the <b>mitigated</b> areas of both parks were not significant at the 0. 05 level of probability. Small fishes, the forage base for the larger piscivores, were equally represented in the <b>mitigated</b> sites throughout the study, and always dominated their respective communities numerically. Differences between natural and <b>mitigated</b> mangrove areas occurred in the distributions of transient species. In general, these transient fishes occurred only in the natural sites: the larval stage of one transient species, however, was found only in the <b>mitigated</b> sites. Likewise, within a species, smaller fishes were generally found in the <b>mitigated</b> sites and larger fishes were found in the natural sites. Thus, differences in the distributions of fishes between the <b>mitigated</b> and natural mangrove sites may be due to food availability as well as structural differences (i. e. spacing of plants) in each habitat. This study shows that <b>mitigated</b> mangrove forests are suitable habitats for small, forage species and presently there are differences in the fish populations in the natural and <b>mitigated</b> mangrove environments, the largest mangrove ecosystem remaining in Broward County...|$|R

30|$|The {{inability}} of wind turbines to <b>mitigate</b> or ride through grid disturbances poses new challenges to operation stability in electric power systems [7]. Small signal or large signal disturbances also cause stability problems in conventional electric power systems. Based on dynamic {{characteristics of the}} load, the process to secure operation stability involves disturbance identification, dynamic control of generations, special protection schemes for system security, etc. Dynamic control of generations responds to disturbances in three ways: active power responses to <b>mitigate</b> phase disturbance, active power responses to <b>mitigate</b> frequency disturbance, and reactive power responses to <b>mitigate</b> voltage disturbance. With large-scale wind generation in the system, the net dynamics of generations exhibits two new features: decreasing ability to <b>mitigate</b> disturbances and decreasing ability to survive disturbances. The study shows that these features first impact voltage stability at the interconnection and further impact angle and frequency stability of the system when the penetration level grows. Large-scale integration of wind therefore requires a substantial increase of the ability of wind plants to <b>mitigate</b> and survive grid disturbances.|$|R

Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall.

5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and <b>mitigating</b> economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} e-learning system <b>mitigates</b> {{the threats}} by performing threat modeling, aspect oriented development, usage of stochastic petri nets and security metric computation.

Adapt methodology to respond to threats, choose best possible way to <b>mitigate</b> the threats and finally choose the appropriate technologies for the identified techniques.|$|R
5000|$|Duty to <b>mitigate</b> - the {{aggrieved party}} {{has a duty}} to take {{reasonable}} steps to <b>mitigate</b> damages. Failure to take such steps can cut off damages which arose from such a failure to take reasonable steps to <b>mitigate.</b> This is a duty of reasonable care thus no duty to take steps which are unreasonably burdensome. Example - buyer breaches contract to purchase produce; seller is expected to <b>mitigate</b> e.g., [...] "cover" [...] under the U.S. Uniform Commercial Code or resale; failure to make reasonable attempts to resell can be a ground to deny damages arising from breach e.g., spoilage. Breaching party is liable for costs which arise from an effort to take reasonable steps to <b>mitigate.</b> E.g., party continues to work after being notified of a breach and running up the bill. (however, this might be reasonable if the aggrieved party reasonably believed they had a better chance of selling a completed product to an alternative buyer).|$|R

5|$|An unusually small hurricane, with gale-force winds {{extending}} only 60mi (95km) {{from its}} center, Danny {{was prone to}} significant fluctuations in intensity, making forecasts particularly difficult. Indeed, the storm soon underwent an unpredicted period of rapid intensification aided by nearly non-existent upper-level wind shear. Low-level moisture wrapped around the circulation during this phase, <b>mitigating</b> {{the influence of the}} Saharan Air Layer. Danny achieved its peak intensity around 12:00UTC on August21 as a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds were estimated at 125mph (205km/h) alongside a barometric pressure of 960mbar (hPa); 28.35inHg). Shortly thereafter, increasing shear and dry air initiated a rapid weakening phase. The storm's eye became obscured by clouds and disappeared from satellite image late on August21.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is the delta wing. The delta wing had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes. The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, <b>mitigating</b> these disadvantages.|$|E
