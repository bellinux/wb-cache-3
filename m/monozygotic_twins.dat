5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} {{of schizophrenia}} is around 80%, which implies that 80% {{of the individual}} differences in risk to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics. These estimates vary {{because of the difficulty}} in separating genetic and environmental influences. The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> of those with schizophrenia are also affected. If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%.|$|E
5|$|A {{central point}} of debate on GWA studies {{has been that}} most of the SNP {{variations}} found by GWA studies are associated with only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, with only a few showing odds ratios above 3.0. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable variation is known from heritability studies based on <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins.</b> For example, it is known that 80-90% of variance in height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> {{are genetically}} nearly {{identical}} {{and they are}} always the same sex unless {{there has been a}} mutation during development. The children of <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> test genetically as half-siblings (or full siblings, if a pair of <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> reproduces with another pair or with the same person), rather than first cousins. Identical twins {{do not have the same}} fingerprints, because even in the confines of the womb, the fetuses touch different parts of this environment, which gives small variations in the same fingerprint, making them unique.|$|E

25|$|The strong genetic {{component}} is borne out in studies on <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins,</b> with a concordance of 38-55%, {{with an even}} higher concordance of circulating thyroid antibodies not in relation to clinical presentation (up to 80% in <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins).</b> Neither result was seen to a similar degree in dizygotic twins, offering strong favour for high genetic aetiology.|$|E

40|$|Metabolomics is the {{comprehensive}} study of metabolites, which are the substrates, intermediate, and end products of cellular metabolism. The heritability of the concentrations of circulating metabolites bears relevance for evaluating their suitability as biomarkers for disease. We report aspects of familial resemblance for the concentrations in human serum of more than 100 metabolites, measured using a targeted metabolomics platform. Age- and sex-corrected <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twin</b> correlations, midparent-offspring regression coefficients, and spouse correlations in subjects from two independent cohorts (Netherlands Twin Register and Leiden Longevity Study) were estimated for each metabolite. In the Netherlands Twin Register subjects, who were largely fasting, we found significant <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twin</b> correlations for 121 out of 123 metabolites. Heritability was confirmed by midparent-offspring regression. For most detected metabolites, the correlations between spouses were considerably lower than those between twins, indicating a contribution of genetic effects to familial resemblance. Remarkably high heritability was observed for free carnitine (<b>monozygotic</b> <b>twin</b> correlation 0. 66), for the amino acids serine (<b>monozygotic</b> <b>twin</b> correlation 0. 77) and threonine (<b>monozygotic</b> <b>twin</b> correlation 0. 64), and for phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C 40 : 3 (<b>monozygotic</b> <b>twin</b> correlation 0. 77). For octenoylcarnitine, a consistent point estimate of approximately 0. 50 was found for the spouse correlations in the two cohorts {{as well as for}} the <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twin</b> correlation, suggesting that familiality for this metabolite is explained by shared environment. We conclude that for the majority of metabolites targeted by the used metabolomics platform, the familial resemblance of serum concentrations is largely genetic. Our results contribute to the knowledge of the heritability of fasting serum metabolite concentrations, which is relevant for biomarker research...|$|R

40|$|Twin {{birth rates}} have {{increased}} markedly {{in developed countries}} since the 1970 s for two primary reasons: increasing maternal age and the advent and increasing use of fertility treatments. In addition, <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twin</b> pregnancies {{have been reported to}} occur at a significantly higher rate following ART procedures compared with the natural incidence. Twin pregnancies are of concern due to a dramatically increased risk of associated complications. <b>Monozygotic</b> <b>twin</b> pregnancies carry a 10 - 20 % risk of twin-twin transfusion syndrome, and monoamnionic monochorionic twins are additionally at risk for cord entanglement. While the mechanisms and contributory factors for dizygotic twinning are well established, very {{little is known about the}} mechanisms involved in <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twinning</b> or the factors that contribute to its occurrence. In this review we will discuss a number of potential mechanisms involved in <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twinning</b> and explore factors that may be contributing to the increased incidence of ART-associated MZ twins. An improved understanding of the factors that contribute to increased <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twinning</b> associated with ART will help to elucidate the poorly understood mechanisms involved in the process and will further aid in reducing the overall incidence of multiple pregnancies with their associated risks following ART procedures...|$|R
25|$|<b>Monozygotic</b> <b>twins,</b> {{although}} genetically very similar, are not genetically {{exactly the}} same. The DNA in {{white blood cells}} of 66 pairs of <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> was analyzed for 506,786 single nucleotide polymorphisms known to occur in human populations. Polymorphisms appeared in 2 of the 33 million comparisons, leading the researchers to extrapolate that the blood cells of <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> may have {{on the order of}} one DNA-sequence difference for every 1.2 x 107 nucleotides, which would imply hundreds of differences across the entire genome. The mutations producing the differences detected in this study would have occurred during embryonic cell-division (after the point of fertilization). If they occur early in fetal development, they will be present in a very large proportion of body cells.|$|E
25|$|Another {{cause of}} {{difference}} between <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> is epigenetic modification, caused by differing environmental influences throughout their lives. Epigenetics refers {{to the level of}} activity of any particular gene. A gene may become switched on, switched off, or could become partially switched on or off in an individual. This epigenetic modification is triggered by environmental events. <b>Monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> can have markedly different epigenetic profiles. A study of 80 pairs of <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> ranging in age from three to 74 showed that the youngest twins have relatively few epigenetic differences. The number of epigenetic differences increases with age. Fifty-year-old twins had over three times the epigenetic difference of three-year-old twins. Twins who had spent their lives apart (such as those adopted by two different sets of parents at birth) had the greatest difference. However, certain characteristics become more alike as twins age, such as IQ and personality.|$|E

25|$|Twin studies, {{adoption}} studies, {{and artificial}} selection {{studies have shown}} that a person's genes can predispose them to developing alcoholism. Evidence from twin studies show that concordance rates for alcoholism are higher for <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> than dizygotic twins—76% for <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> and 61% for dizygotic twins. However, female twin studies demonstrate that females have much lower concordance rates than males. Reasons for gender differences may be due to environmental factors, such as negative public attitudes towards female drinkers. Twin studies suggest that males {{are more likely to have}} a genetic predisposition for alcoholism. However, this does not suggest that a male who does have a genetic predisposition will become an alcoholic. Sometimes the individual may never encounter an environmental trigger that leads to alcoholism.|$|E

25|$|<b>Monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> {{who share}} a {{placenta}} can develop twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. This condition means that blood from one twin is being diverted into the other twin.

25|$|Genetic factors: Genetic factors {{predispose}} both to {{alcoholism and}} to alcoholic liver disease. Both <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twins</b> {{are more likely}} to be alcoholics and to develop liver cirrhosis than both dizygotic twins. Polymorphisms in the enzymes involved in the metabolism of alcohol, such as ADH, ALDH, CYP4502E1, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytokine polymorphism may partly explain this genetic component. However, no specific polymorphisms have currently been firmly linked to alcoholic liver disease.|$|E

40|$|<b>Monozygotic</b> <b>twinning</b> is rare within populations yet taxonomically widespread. We {{explore the}} {{evolution}} of <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twinning</b> by modeling an allele in a newly formed offspring that causes it to undergo mitosis and separation to form one or more clones (twins), potentially {{in conflict with the}} parents' best interest. The success of this twinning allele in our haploid models depends on the balance of the benefit of increased frequency in the clutch and the cost of reduced survival resulting from limited parental resources. The trait reaches high frequency in a broad range of plausible conditions but also fails to spread or is kept at low frequency in others when the survival cost is high (e. g., in small clutch sizes). Interestingly, there are two reasonable conditions that predict high frequency of the trait but low visibility: random parental abortion and selection for low penetrance. Thus our models suggest reasons why <b>monozygotic</b> <b>twinning</b> might be rare, or alternatively, be common yet appear rare. In addition, we discuss the implications for sex-linked twinning, dizygotic twinning, and twinning by gametes...|$|R
