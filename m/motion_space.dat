60|$|One thing seems {{strange to}} me,--that whilst all men manifestly {{measured}} {{time by the}} motion of the great and visible bodies of the world, time yet should be defined to be the 'measure of motion': whereas it is obvious to every one who reflects ever so little on it, that to measure <b>motion,</b> <b>space</b> is as necessary to be considered as time; and those who look a little farther will find also the bulk of the thing moved necessary to be taken into the computation, by any one who will estimate or measure motion so as to judge right of it. Nor indeed does motion any otherwise conduce to the measuring of duration, than as it constantly brings about the return of certain sensible ideas, in seeming equidistant periods. For if {{the motion of the}} sun were as unequal as of a ship driven by unsteady winds, sometimes very slow, and at others irregularly very swift; or if, being constantly equally swift, it yet was not circular, and produced not the same appearances,--it would not at all help us to measure time, any more than the seeming unequal motion of a comet does.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{discusses}} recent {{analyses of}} the shape of <b>motion</b> <b>spaces</b> for legged robots in quasistatic equilibrium at a given set of contacts. Two robots were examined: HRP- 2, a biologically inspired humanoid designed by AIST Japan, and ATHLETE, a six-legged, non-biologically inspired robot designed by NASA. Probabilistic roadmap techniques are used to compute the approximate connectivity of several hundred <b>motion</b> <b>spaces.</b> Results suggest that <b>motion</b> <b>spaces</b> for HRP- 2 are connected, while those of ATHLETE are frequently disconnected. This signifies that when planning long-range locomotion, HRP- 2 only needs to reason about its footsteps, while ATHLETE must reason about its pose as well. This makes planning {{much more difficult for}} ATHLETE, a claim that is supported by experience both in human teleoperation and in motion planning algorithms. If similar findings hold for other biological mechanisms, then {{it can be argued that}} evolution has selected for mechanisms that minimize the cognitive load needed for locomotion, which could form the foundation of a strong argument for biologically-inspired design.

40|$|Abstract — A new {{parallel}} grasper mechanism having 3 -DOF spherical motions is proposed. The mechanism {{consists of}} one parallel four-bar chain and four serial sub-chains that are {{connected in parallel}} to the four-bar chain. Particularly, all joint axes of the mechanism are placed to have a common intersection point securing that all joint <b>motion</b> <b>spaces</b> of the mechanism are confined within the 3 -DOF spherical <b>motion</b> <b>spaces.</b> Thus, the mechanism can not only grasp irregular shaped objects by changing configuration of its four-bar chain, but also exhibit 3 DOF spherical motions after grasping. The position analysis and kinematic analysis of the mechanism are performed. Also, its kinematic characteristics are investigated through simulation in aspects of three kinematic design indices. Lastly, a prototype was developed and tested through motion tracking and grasping experiments. Keywords- Parallel Mechanism; Grasper; Spherical motion I...|$|R

50|$|This {{problem has}} been {{resolved}} by Einstein's theory of general relativity in which gravitational interaction is mediated by deformation of space-time geometry. Matter warps the geometry of space-time and these effects are, as with electric and magnetic fields, propagated {{at the speed of}} light. Thus, in the presence of matter, space-time becomes non-Euclidean, resolving the apparent conflict between Newton's proof of the conservation of angular momentum and Einstein's theory of special relativity. Mach's question regarding the bulging of rotating bodies is resolved because local space-time geometry is informing a rotating body {{about the rest of the}} universe. In Newton's theory of <b>motion,</b> <b>space</b> acts on objects, but is not acted upon. In Einstein's theory of motion, matter acts upon space-time geometry, deforming it, and space-time geometry acts upon matter, by affecting the behavior of geodesics.|$|E

40|$|Assembly {{planning}} {{is the problem}} of finding a sequence of motions to assemble a product from its parts. We present a general framework for finding assembly motions based on the concept of <b>motion</b> <b>space.</b> Assembly motions are parameterized such that each point in <b>motion</b> <b>space</b> represents a mating motion that is independent of the moving part set. For each motion we derive blocking relations that explicitly state which parts collide with other parts; each subassembly (rigid subset of parts) that does not collide {{with the rest of the}} assembly can easily be derived from the blocking relations. <b>Motion</b> <b>space</b> is partitioned into an arrangement of cells such that the blocking relations are fixed within each cell.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of an {{increasing}} <b>motion</b> <b>space</b> on the fidelity of driving simulation in the Desdemona research simulator. The experimental task was a standardized slalom maneuver where the car velocity was limited to 70 km/h. Subjective measures, which included eight statements on realism and task performance were used to assess simulation fidelity. The slalom task was driven in four conditions: 1) one-toone <b>motion</b> <b>space,</b> 2) 0. 7 times the <b>motion</b> <b>space,</b> 3) 0. 4 times the <b>motion</b> <b>space,</b> and 4) nomotion. The conditions were compared pair-wise. In total 16 participants completed the experiment. Compared to the no-motion condition, driving a slalom maneuver in Desdemona was judged more realistic when motion cues were available, where the magnitude of the motion, within the range of 0. 4 to 1, has less to no effect on the realism compared to the issue of motion versus no-motion. Furthermore, the participants indicated that motion and forces actuated by Desdemona helped to conduct their task better...|$|E
40|$|Dim {{targets are}} {{extremely}} difficult to detect using methods based on single-frame detection. Radiation accumulation {{is one of the}} effective methods to improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A detection approach based on radiation accumulation is proposed. First, a location space and a <b>motion</b> <b>space</b> are established. Radiation accumulation operation, controlled by vectors from the <b>motion</b> <b>space,</b> is applied to the original image space. Then, a new image space is acquired where some images have an improved SNR. Second, quasitargets in the new image space are obtained by constant false-alarm ratio judging, and location vectors and motion vectors of quasitargets are also acquired simultaneously. Third, the location vectors and motion vectors are mapped into the two spaces, respectively. Volume density function is defined in the <b>motion</b> <b>space.</b> Location extremum of the location space and volume density extremum of <b>motion</b> <b>space</b> will confirm the true target. Finally, actual location of the true target in the original image space is obtained by space inversion. The approach is also applicable to detect multiple dim targets. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate the approach is superior to compared approaches on detection probability and false alarm probability. © 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) ...|$|E
