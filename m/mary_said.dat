5|$|When Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to {{organize}} the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar {{for the first time}} in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C. where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, <b>Mary,</b> <b>said</b> that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.|$|E
25|$|Like many medieval {{works of}} art, the Madonna {{displays}} {{a very complex}} iconography. The statue shows the Virgin in a rather plain gown, while the oversized Christ child figure in her lap wears a precious pontifical gown. The size is meant to illustrate the importance of Christ as redeemer. In contrast Mary is depicted in a serving role, in accordance with Luke 1:38: And <b>Mary</b> <b>said,</b> Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. At {{the same time she}} embodies the Seat of Wisdom as the Throne of Solomon is described in 1 Kings 10:18: Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold. Sitting on her lap is the Christ child, whose ornate chasuble betokens his significance as ruler of the heavens, the book his role as herald of the faith. Bearing in mind other medieval portrayals of Christ as teacher, it may be supposed that the child’s lost right arm was originally raised in a gesture of blessing. However, Christ’s face is turned towards his mother, while from any position Mary’s look seems directed towards the beholder. Thus Mary may arguably not only be interpreted as a passive devotee but also assumes the role of mediator between the people and the Redeemer.|$|E

2500|$|Lúcia {{said that}} the Lady {{emphasized}} Acts of Reparation and prayers to console Jesus {{for the sins of}} the world. Lúcia said that Mary's words were, [...] "When you make some sacrifice, say 'O Jesus, it is for your love, for the conversion of sinners, and in reparation for sins committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.'" [...] At the apparition of 13 July 1917, Lucia said Mary told the children that sinners could be saved from damnation by devotion to the Immaculate Heart, but also by making [...] "sacrifices". They heard her repeat the idea of sacrifices several times. Her vision of hell prompted them to ever more stringent self-mortifications to save souls. Among many other practices, Lúcia wrote that she and her cousins wore tight cords around their waists, flogged themselves with stinging nettles, gave their lunches to beggars, and abstained from drinking water on hot days. Francisco and Jacinta became extremely devoted to this practice. Lúcia wrote that <b>Mary</b> <b>said</b> God was pleased with their sacrifices and bodily penances.|$|E
