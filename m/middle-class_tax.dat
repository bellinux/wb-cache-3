40|$|From introduction: My paper studies a {{globally}} acclaimed {{experiment in}} computer literacy and cultural capital in Seelampur, {{located on the}} Delhi-Uttar Pradesh state border. In late 2003, Datamation, a prominent private, Delhi based Information Technology firm, with partial funding from UNESCO and the Delhi state government, established computer literacy and e-commerce development projects in Zaffarabad in Seelampur. Seelampur is a diverse community but {{like the rest of}} the area, Zaffarabad is largely a settlement of informal working class Muslims. State violence and dominant middle-class interests have historically colluded to create Seelampur. During the National Emergency years in 1975 - 1977, residents of Seelampur were given small plots of land in exchange for demolitions of their homes and forced sterilization at the same time that <b>middle-class</b> groups received <b>tax</b> breaks (Tarlo, 2003). Over the decades, the Delhi government has raided and razed homes and businesses in Seelampur, enforcing its policies on slum clearance and recently, its controversial environment laws on closure of several manufacturing industries that are an integral part of the local and national economy...|$|R

50|$|The {{requested}} {{budget was}} submitted by President Clinton on February 6, 1995, just five {{weeks after the}} beginning of the 104th United States Congress, which was dominated by Republicans to had been victorious in the November 1994 midterm election. Clinton's requested budget provided a <b>middle-class</b> <b>tax</b> cut, including new deductions for children and college expenses, which was offset by a twice-as-large reduction in spending elsewhere in the budget, echoing Speaker Gingrich's goal to eliminate programs that had outlived their usefulness. However, Republicans had demanded a budget that would lead to a balanced budget in 2002, but Clinton's budget projected annual deficits of around $190 billion up to 2005. Clinton's plan also proposed to abolish the Interstate Commerce Commission, and reorganize the Departments of Energy, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development by consolidating programs into fewer, larger ones, as well as the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration by cutting their staff by a third and a half, respectively.|$|E

40|$|We empirically {{assess the}} {{distributional}} impacts and welfare effects of policies to incentivize renewable electricity production {{for the case}} of Italy. We use data from the Household Budget Survey between 2000 and 2010 to estimate a demand system in which energy goods' shares of expenditure are modelled using different empirical approaches. We show that the general Exact Affine Stone Index (EASI) demand system provides more robust estimates of price elasticities of each composite good than the commonly used Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS). The estimated coefficients are used to perform a welfare analysis of the Italian renewable electricity production incentive policy. We show that different empirical approaches give rise to significantly different estimates of price elasticities and that methodological choices are {{the reasons for the}} very high elasticities of substitutions estimated using similar data by previous contributions. We find no evidence of regressivity of the incidence of the Italian renewable incentive scheme in the period under consideration. The renewable subsidies act as a <b>middle-class</b> <b>tax,</b> with the higher welfare losses experienced by households in the second to fourth quintiles of the expenditure distribution...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of Georgia’s HOPE (Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally) scholarship program, seven additional Southeastern states have adopted similar merit-based financial aid programs, {{most of which are}} also funded by state lotteries. This study examines why North Carolina after adopting a state lottery in 2005 did not allocate its proceeds for a merit schol-arship program. This in-depth case study considers the explanatory power of a revised multiple streams model and the integrated diffusion model by ana-lyzing data collected through elite interviews and archival documents. The study findings suggest that internal determinants, such as North Carolina’s educational and economic context, trumped regional diffusion trends and that the multiple stream model’s “black box ” influences, such as political tactics and gamesmanship, provide the most conceptually compelling explanation for why merit aid became a “nonevent ” in North Carolina. Indeed, by con-sidering decisions and nondecisions, researchers may capture a broader array of state-level characteristics that influence policy adoption. Keywords: politics of higher education; public policy process; student financial aid During his first two years in office, Georgia’s governor, Zell Miller, advocated for {{the adoption}} of a state lottery with proceeds allocated to fund education programs, including the HOPE (Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally) scholarship program. In 1992, the voters approved a statewide referendum to create the Georgia Lottery for Education and within two years the state began awarding HOPE scholarships that pro-vided full-tuition grants to “B ” average students. Within a decade, a dozen additional states adopted similar merit-based scholarship programs and the federal government implemented the HOPE tax credit as part of President Bill Clinton’s reelection platform targeted on <b>middle-class</b> <b>tax</b> relief (Lederman, 1997). Furthermore, in past decade, the proliferation of thes...|$|E
