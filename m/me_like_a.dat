25|$|The Felt {{theory was}} a strong one... Felt had a {{personal}} motive for acting. After the death of J. Edgar Hoover... Felt {{thought he was a}} leading candidate to succeed Hoover... The characteristics were a good fit. The trouble with Felt's candidacy was that Deep Throat in All the President's Men simply did not sound to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> career FBI man.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Aguilera compares {{her love}} to office equipment, from paperclips to rubber-bands, {{as a metaphor}} for a relationship. The lyric [...] "A rubber band is what I call your love for me, cause it comes and goes and pins <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> trampoline" [...] was spoken by Aguilera at the beginning. The part [...] "If I was a ruler I'd try to set you straight, but your love is like a sharpener, it really grates" [...] was praised by several critics, while the lines [...] "A rubber band was an analogy, you can even say it's a metaphor" [...] were {{described}} by others as unnecessary, with Becky Bain for Idolator calling it [...] "dumber-than-dumb". Toward the closing moments, she sings, [...] "Paper clips they couldn't even hold us together... when your love hits, it sticks <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> stapler." ...|$|E
500|$|A lot {{of people}} feel I'm overbearing, so I wasn't allowed in the studio when she did her vocals. I'm trying to work on that, I'm such a perfectionist, {{sometimes}} I don't give people the chance to breathe. So I've been banned from a lot of studios. Mariah [...] until she thought it was perfect, like a hundred times. She gave <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hundred tracks to choose from.|$|E
500|$|After {{his last}} {{contribution}} to acting in 2003 [...] a guest role on Will & Grace {{for which he}} received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor [...] Wilder {{turned his attention to}} writing.

500|$|Riefenstahl heard Nazi Party (NSDAP) leader Adolf Hitler {{speak at}} a rally in 1932 and was mesmerized by his talent as a public speaker. Describing the {{experience}} in her memoir, Riefenstahl wrote, [...] "I had an almost apocalyptic vision that I was never able to forget. It seemed as if the Earth's surface were spreading out in front of <b>me,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hemisphere that suddenly splits apart in the middle, spewing out an enormous jet of water, so powerful that it touched the sky and shook the earth".|$|E
500|$|We {{would have}} little family talks. They began at first with Malcolm telling me what he {{expected}} of a wife. But the first time I told him what I expected {{of him as a}} husband it came as a shock.

Here I've been going along having our little workshops with me doing all the talking and you doing all the listening." [...] He concluded our marriage should be a mutual exchange.|$|E
500|$|During the post-race press conference, Harvick and Busch {{commented on}} their {{accident}} during the race. [...] "Harvick pulled a slide job on my {{earlier in the}} day, I crossed over and passed him clean. My guys worked way too hard {{to be in this}} position to have a wrecked race car {{at the end of the}} year. It means so much to me to finish the year strong. I talked to him in the driver’s meeting but Kevin is such a two-faced guy it doesn’t really matter," [...] Busch said. Afterward, Harvick said [...] "Kyle raced <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> clown all day." ...|$|E
60|$|As we went I {{told him}} {{the rest of the}} story--the Angela part. He laid down his {{portmanteau}} and looked at <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> owl through his glasses.|$|R

500|$|However, {{during the}} {{unveiling}} of the monster, Burns is blinded by camera flashes. He runs into a camera, which crashes and starts a fire: the crowd panic and flee. Following this disaster, Homer then cheers up Burns {{by pointing out that}} being loved means you have to be nice to people everyday but being hated means {{you do not have to}} do anything. Burns agrees with that logic, saying [...] "I'm a selfish old crank--and that fits <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Speedo!" [...] In the aftermath of the incident, Homer and Burns give Nessie a job at the [...] "Vegas Town Casino".|$|E
500|$|Trainor's song [...] "Title" [...] {{also became}} {{the subject of}} the same controversy, and was dubbed [...] "just as anti-feminist" [...] as [...] "All About That Bass". L.V. Anderson of Slate wrote that [...] "Title" [...] perpetuated a {{retrograde}} belief about relationships and deemed Trainor a poor role model, and opined, [...] "Once again she is sending the message that a woman's worth is defined by men". Sean Michaels of The Guardian highlighted the lyrics, [...] "You gotta treat <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> trophy / Put me on the shelf / You gotta show me off," [...] as controversial.|$|E

IGN.com ranked John Waters's performance as the ninth-best guest appearance in the show's history, with TV Guide naming him the third-best film-related guest star.

John Patterson of The Guardian wrote that Waters' appearance [...] "felt to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> summit meeting between the most influential pop-culture figures of the last 25 years".|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, Chamberlain damaged his {{reputation}} in an April 1965 article with Sports Illustrated. In an interview entitled [...] "My Life in a Bush League", he criticized his fellow players, coaches, and NBA administrators. Chamberlain later commented {{that he could}} see in hindsight how the interview could have been instrumental in hurting his public image. However, contemporary colleagues were often terrified to play against Chamberlain. Bill Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain, Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court [...] "comical", and when 6ft 11in 250-pound (in his early years) Hall-of-Fame center Bob Lanier was asked about the most memorable moment of his career, Lanier answered: [...] "When Wilt Chamberlain lifted me up and moved <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> coffee cup so he could get a favorable position." ...|$|E
500|$|After marrying Sara Fricker {{in autumn}} 1795, Coleridge left their home at Clevedon {{and began to}} travel {{throughout}} England {{in order to meet}} with various philosophers and political theorists. In part, he was trying to meet with people so he could raise subscriptions for his various works. During this time, he would write home constantly to his pregnant wife and was concerned about her state of health. His feelings of guilt, along with a fever that he treated with laudanum, affected him greatly and caused him to express these feelings in a letter to Josiah Wade on 10 February 1796: [...] "My past life seems to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dream, a feverish dream! all one gloomy huddle of strange actions, and dim-discovered motives! Friendships lost by indolence, and happiness murdered by mismanaged sensibilities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he {{affected}} <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> etching {{of himself}} from a wornout plate. Still, I'm afraid there's likeness enough left to make trouble, yet. I hope {{you realize what}} you have gone in for, Isabel?" ...|$|R

500|$|The investors {{showed little}} {{interest}} in Tesla's ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing {{side of the business}} was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility. They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla's company and leaving the inventor penniless. Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock. He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Later in life Tesla would recount that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing [...] "My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mockery".|$|E
500|$|Symeon {{repeatedly}} {{describes the}} experience of divine light in his writings, as both an inward and outward mystical experience. These experiences began in his youth, and continued all during his life. They came to him during inward prayer and contemplation, and were associated {{with a feeling of}} indescribable joy, as well as the intellectual understanding that the light was a vision of God. In his writings, he spoke directly to God about the experience variously as [...] "the pure Light of your face" [...] and [...] "You deigned to reveal Your face to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> formless sun." [...] He also described the light as the grace of God, and taught that its experience was associated with a mind that was completely still and had transcended itself. At times he described the light speaking to him with kindness, and explaining who it was.|$|E
500|$|After Troutman's death, Ice Cube {{said that}} [...] "More Bounce To The Ounce" [...] {{introduced}} him to hip-hop. [...] "I was in the sixth grade, we'd stayed after school. We had this dude named Mr. Lock, {{and he used to}} bring in his radio with these pop-lockers. He used to teach [...] the L.A. Lockers, and he would do community service in after-school programs. He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances, he put on that song 'More Bounce', and they started pop-locking. And I think from that visual, from seeing that, it was my first introduction into hip-hop. Period. I didn't know nothing about nothing. I hadn't heard [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] yet. It was the first thing that was really fly to me. They started dancing, and since 'More Bounce' goes on forever, they just got down. I just think that was a rush of adrenaline for <b>me,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> chemical reaction in my brain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] he grumbled, [...] "you {{come with}} me and do the talking. I protest in advance against any such {{outrageous}} invasion of my private life."
