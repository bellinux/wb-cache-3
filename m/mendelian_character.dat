40|$|Hereditary hypohidrotic {{ectodermal}} dysplasia, {{also called}} the Christ-Siemens-Touraine Syndrome is characterized by congenital dysplasia {{of one or more}} ectodermal structures and is manifested by hypohidrosis, hypotrichosis and hypodontia. It is usually an X-linked recessive <b>mendelian</b> <b>character</b> which is rarely seen in males. It results from abnormal morphogenesis of cutaneous and oral embryonic ectoderm. Patients with this disorder exhibit smooth, thin and dry skin, fine and blond scanty hair. Intra-orally anodontia or hypodontia, with impaired development of alveolar process is seen.

40|$|The {{intensity}} of the cellular immune response to strong transplantation antigens of the H- 2 complex {{is related to the}} histological type of cells taken for immunization.

The reverse was observed when, instead of BALB/c mice, C 57 B 1 / 6 and A/He were used in immunization experiments. Analysis of the inheritance of this immunization pattern studied in mice of the first generation from various crosses between strains (BALB/c, C 57 B 1 / 6 and A/He) and in mice from backcrosses has demonstrated that this immunization pattern is not inherited as a simple <b>Mendelian</b> <b>character.</b> Therefore, it could be supposed that efficiency of immunological control of cells having different histological types, may be genetically determined...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a selection procedure {{based on the}} observation that diphtheria toxin kills spheroplasts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Murakami et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 2 : 588 - 592, 1982); this procedure yielded mutants resistant to the in vitro action of the toxin. Spheroplasts of mutagenized S. cerevisiae were transformed {{in the presence of}} diphtheria toxin, and the transformed survivors were screened in vitro for toxin-resistant elongation factor 2. Thirty-one haploid ADP ribosylation-negative mutants comprising five complementation groups were obtained by this procedure. The mutants grew normally and were stable to prolonged storage. Heterozygous diploids produced by mating wild-type sensitive cells with the mutants revealed that in each case the resistant phenotype was recessive to the sensitive phenotype. Sporulation of these diploids yielded tetrads in which the resistant phenotype segregated as a single <b>Mendelian</b> <b>character.</b> From these observations, we concluded that these mutants are defective in the enzymatic steps responsible for the posttranslational modification of elongation factor 2 which is necessary for recognition by diphtheria toxin...|$|E
40|$|Belted cattle have a {{circular}} belt of unpigmented {{hair and skin}} around their midsection. The belt is inherited as a monogenic autosomal dominant trait. We mapped the causative variant to a 37 kb segment on bovine chromosome 3. Whole genome sequence data of 2 belted and 130 control cattle yielded only one private genetic variant in the critical interval in the two belted animals. The belt-associated variant was a copy number variant (CNV) involving the quadruplication of a 6 kb non-coding sequence located approximately 16 kb upstream of the TWIST 2 gene. Increased copy numbers at this CNV were strongly associated with the belt phenotype in a cohort of 333 cases and 1322 controls. We hypothesized that the CNV causes aberrant expression of TWIST 2 during neural crest development, which might negatively affect melanoblasts. Functional studies showed that ectopic expression of bovine TWIST 2 in neural crest in transgenic zebrafish led to a decrease in melanocyte numbers. Our results thus implicate an unsuspected involvement of TWIST 2 in regulating pigmentation and reveal a non-coding CNV underlying a captivating <b>Mendelian</b> <b>character...</b>|$|E
50|$|Falk and Ayala (1971) {{in their}} {{research}} {{found that these}} variants are largely inherited, although their genetic make up cannot be attributed the existing Mendelian models. 1 In this regard, Ferronato et al. (1974) found no significant correlation between parents and children. Individual type of arms folding is slightly less studied than the manner of clasping hands. In search of the main factors that determine this dimorphism, the same difficulties emerge as with clasping hands. However, utilising the findings and the views of many authors, {{it can be concluded}} that the manner of arms folding is hereditary and that it inherits the model that does not fit into the genetics concept of simple <b>Mendelian</b> <b>characters,</b> although in this respect there are contradictory findings. The main conclusion is that the manifestation of alternative phenotypes with these characteristics is irrespective of sex and age, and that it is not related to handedness.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{analysed}} mouse telomeres by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). A number of specific restriction fragments hybridising to a (TTA-GGG) 4 probe in the size range 50 - 150 kb can be detected. These fragments are devoid of sites for most restriction enzymes suggesting that they comprise simple repeats; we argue {{that most of these}} are likely to be (TTAGGG) n. Each discrete fragment corresponds to the telomere of an individual chromosome and segregates as a <b>Mendelian</b> <b>character.</b> However, new size variants are being generated in the germ line at very high rates such that inbred mice are heterozygous at all telomeres analysable. In addition we show that specific small (approximately 4 - 12 kb) fragments can be cleaved within some terminal arrays by the restriction enzyme MnII which recognises 5 '(N 7) GAGG 3 '. Like the complete telomere-repeat arrays (TRA's) these fragments form new variants at high rates and possibly by the same process. We speculate on the mechanisms that may be involved...|$|E
40|$|For {{some years}} we have been making studies with Cladocera on the {{occurrence}} of mutations and their inheritance in parthenogenesis. Four mutant characters have been studied in Daphnia longispina. The inheritance is complete, since every parthenogenetic young from a mutant individual genetically possesses the mutant character (except, of course, for the occasional interference of another mutation). This is in accord with expectation, {{in view of the}} absence of chromatic reduction and segregation in the maturation of the parthenogenetic (diploid) eggs in Cladocera. It was of further interest to obtain, if possible, sexual reproduction and hybrid offspring between mutant clones and the “wild” type. Sexual eggs (haploid and requiring fertilization) are frequently obtainable, and males may usually be obtained when desired, but {{it is not easy to}} obtain, simultaneously, ovarian sexual eggs and functional males from just the stocks desired. When sexual eggs and active males are obtained at the same time, fertilization frequently does not occur, and the fertilized eggs when obtained give exceedingly poor hatches, so that many fruitless attempts preceded the obtaining of the desired hybrids. Forty hybrids have been or are now being studied and some data obtained on the inheritance of the two mutant characters involved in the stock used in the crosses. The characters involved are sex-intergradedness and “excavated” head. Twenty-nine of these hybrids are from wild type × mutant, and 11 are from the reciprocal cross. Nineteen of these hybrids genetically possess the mutant character, excavated head, and 19 show sex intergradedness. It seems probable, therefore, that each of these characters is a dominant <b>mendelian</b> <b>character</b> and is heterozygous in the mutant clones used in the crosses. Further breeding and study will be necessary before the full extent of the inheritance of these characters is determined...|$|E
40|$|The GIX antigen {{expressed}} on the thymocytes of GIX+ mice is a type- specific constituent of glycoprotein gp 70, {{which forms}} the major envelope component of murine leukemia virus. In the prototype GIX+ mouse strain 129, this glycoprotein is a <b>Mendelian</b> <b>character</b> expressed independently of virus production. In the intact thymocyte plasma membrane, {{part of this}} glycoprotein, bearing group-specific (gs) antigen, is inaccessible to antibody. The moiety bearing the type- specific GIX determinant is accessible to GIX antibody, which {{may be an important}} factor in determining the consequences of autoimmune responses involving GIX. Previously, all attempts to induce GIX antibody in mice had failed. We now find that the hybrid mouse (B 6 -GIX+ X 129) spontaneously produces substantial amounts of GIX antibody, presumably of the IgM class appearing as early as 2 mo of age. The specificity of the GIX natural mouse antibody is the same as that recognized by the conventional GIX typing serum produced in rats ("anti- NTD"). As neither parent strain produces appreciable GIX antibody, we surmise that this autoimmune response requires two dominant genes, each parent contributing a high-response allele to the hybrid. These can be envisaged as two immune response loci, controlling different immunocompetent cells which must cooperate to produce GIX antibody. Production of GIX antibody by the hybrids increases progressively with age. This is accompanied by decreased expression of GIX antigen on their thymocytes. We attribute this to antigenic modulation. Antibody to gs antigen of gp 70 is also found in autoimmune (B 6 -GIX+ X 129) hybrids but not in either parent strain. We are investigating evidence of a pathological autoimmune syndrome in these hybrids. The special interest of this syndrome is that it presumably signifies the consequences of autoimmunization to a single C-type virus component, expressed without significant virus production, in a mouse with no evident genetic predisposition to such disease in the absence of that antigen...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] and fruit quality traits were evaluated and compared for three consecutive years on 1, 111 seedlings coming from 15 peach and nectarine breeding crosses, grown under a Mediterranean climate. Significant differences among {{and within the}} different progenies were found {{for most of the}} traits analyzed. The breeding population segregated for several <b>Mendelian</b> <b>characters</b> such as peach or nectarine fruit, round or flat fruit, yellow or white flesh and freestone or clingstone. In addition, aborting fruit and flat fruit trees were found in our progeny, and our data seem to support multi-allelic control of both flat shape and aborting fruit. The variation within the progenies of some traits such as blooming and harvesting date, yield, fruit weight and SSC was continuous, suggesting a polygenic inheritance. Relationships between qualitative pomological traits and these agronomic and fruit quality parameters were also found. Valuable correlations among agronomic and fruit quality parameters were found, although coefficients of variation depending on the progeny should be considered. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) revealed several relationships among quality traits in the evaluated progenies. Based on this evaluation, 26 outstanding genotypes were pre-selected from the initial breeding population for further studies.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the A receptors was studied among 'agglutinated' and 'free' populations of A variant RBC (A 3, AX, Aend) known to be either partially or weakly agglutinated by human anti-A reagents. Following separation of the red cell populations and disaggregation of the clumps by mild treatment with soluble blood group substances, it was shown after appropriate controls, that among A 3 ARBC, the 'agglutinated' RBC have {{at least five times}} as 'free' RBC, these latter however being strongly A positive. The differences between the A antigenic content of the AX RBC were less pronounced. The most striking result was obtained with the Aend RBC, where two populations are clearly demonstrated; the first, including 5 - 10 per cent of the RBC, strongly agglutinates with anti-A and contains erythrocytes of high antigenic content (140, 000 A receptors per cell). The second, including the majority of RBC could not be differentiated from the control O RBC. A wide heterogeneity of antibody binding capacity of the various populations of A 3, AX and Aend red cells, was also demonstrated following ultrastructural examination by immunoelectron microscopy with peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Such study reveals furthermore an heterogeneity of labelling from one cell to another in the same population of red blood cells. Comparison of 'week A' RBC and O RBC enzymatically converted into A RBC, demonstrates a similar pattern of reactivity between these cells, and supports the general relationship between antigen site density and red cell agglutination. It is concluded that the typical pattern of agglutinability of A 3 and AX RBC arises both from their heterogeneous antigenic content and from the occurrence of an antigenic threshold below which red cells become non-agglutinable. The typical mixed-field agglutination pattern of Aend RBC merely reflects the occurrence of a probably true dual population of RBC. Finally, the mechanisms of inheritance of such well-known <b>Mendelian</b> <b>characters,</b> enabling the production of highly heterogeneous blood cell populations in the same individual, remains to be elucidated...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} experiments, seven {{lines of}} valine-resistant plants were regenerated from protoplast-derived haploid tobacco mesophyll cells {{which had been}} UV mutagenized and submitted to selection by toxic concentrations of valine. In this study we described the transmission of valine-resistance to progeny and a preliminary phenotypical and biochemical characterization of the resistant plants. —Two types were thus distinguished among the seven mutant lines. Valine-resistance of the mutants of the first type (three lines) was transmitted as a single <b>Mendelian</b> dominant <b>character</b> (Vr 1), whereas valine-resistance of the second type (four lines) was transmitted as a digenic recessive character (vr 2 and vr 3). Allelism tests revealed that the four recessive mutant lines yielded resistant progeny when intercrossed and, therefore, bear recessive mutant alleles at the same two unlinked loci. —When cultured at a density of 100 cell/ml, protoplast-derived cells of mutants of the first type had {{a low level of}} resistance to valine, whereas protoplast-derived cells of mutants of the second type displayed a high level of resistance to valine and to other amino acids. —According to the results of 14 C-labelled amino acid uptake experiments, the amino acid resistance of mutants of the second type, but not valine-resistance of the first type, could be accounted for by reduced uptake of several amino acids.

As a foundational {{step towards}} deciphering the interspecific genome structures, a reference whole genome sequence {{was produced by}} the International Citrus Genome Consortium from a haploid derived from Clementine mandarin. The availability of a saturated genetic map of Clementine was identified as an essential prerequisite to assist the whole genome sequence assembly. Clementine {{is believed to be}} a ‘Mediterranean’ mandarin × sweet orange hybrid, and sweet orange likely arose from interspecific hybridizations between mandarin and pummelo gene pools. The primary goals of the present study were to establish a Clementine reference map using codominant markers, and to perform comparative mapping of pummelo, sweet orange, and Clementine. Results Five parental genetic maps were established from three segregating populations, which were genotyped with Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) and Insertion-Deletion (Indel) markers. An initial medium density reference map (961 markers for 1084. 1 cM) of the Clementine was established by combining male and female Clementine segregation data. This Clementine map was compared with two pummelo maps and a sweet orange map. The linear order of markers was highly conserved in the different species. However, significant differences in map size were observed, which suggests a variation in the recombination rates. Skewed segregations were much higher in the male than female Clementine mapping data. The mapping data confirmed that Clementine arose from hybridization between ‘Mediterranean’ mandarin and sweet orange. The results identified nine recombination break points for the sweet orange gamete that contributed to the Clementine genome.
