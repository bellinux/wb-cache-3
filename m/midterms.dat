In the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama carried 40% of white voters without college degrees to John McCain carrying 58%.

25|$|Along with Ronald Reagan's decisive {{victory over}} {{incumbent}} President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, Wolf's third {{run for the}} House seat proved to be successful, as he won the Republican primary with 75% of the vote and then defeated Fisher in a re-election, 51%–49%. In the 1982 <b>midterms,</b> Wolf won re-election with 53% of the vote. Wolf was unopposed by a Democratic opponent in 1994 and 2000. His closest races have come in the Democratic wave elections of 2006 and 2008. On both occasions he defeated professor Judy Feder, by 57%–41% and 59%–39%, respectively.

50|$|In 2002, Bush had {{the highest}} {{approval}} rating of any president during a <b>midterm</b> congressional election since Dwight D. Eisenhower.

25|$|Democrats held a small {{majority}} in the General Assembly during Schricker's first two years in office, but in the <b>midterms,</b> Republicans again took power. They passed legislation to make public the names of welfare recipients and the amounts received. This was in violation of federal welfare laws, and {{would have resulted in}} a loss of federal funding for the state welfare system. Schricker vetoed the bill, but the legislature overrode his veto. The federal government immediately cut off funding, creating an $18 million budget deficit for the state. Schricker called a special session of the legislature to resolve the financial situation, but no solution could be agreed upon. Instead the legislators passed a bill that delayed the opening of the public welfare records by two years. Meanwhile, Senator William E. Jenner successfully introduced legislation at the federal level to prevent the state from losing its funding once the bill took effect.|$|E
25|$|Starting with Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1925, and {{continued}} through the Democrats' control of the House from 1931 to 1995, save for Republican majorities in 1947–49 and 1953–55, all majority leaders have directly ascended to the Speakership brought upon by the retirement of the incumbent. The only exceptions during this period were Charles A. Halleck who became Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 1959 to 1965, Hale Boggs {{who died in a}} plane crash, and Dick Gephardt who became the Democrats' House leader but as Minority Leader since his party lost control in the 1994 midterm elections. Since 1995, the only Majority Leader to become Speaker is John Boehner, though indirectly as his party lost control in the 2006 <b>midterms</b> elections. He subsequently served as Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011 and then was elected Speaker when the House reconvened in 2011. In 1998, with Speaker Newt Gingrich announcing his resignation, both Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay did not contest the Speakership which eventually went to Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert.|$|E
25|$|North Carolina's party loyalties have {{undergone}} {{a series of}} important shifts {{in the last few}} years: While the 2010 <b>midterms</b> saw Tar Heel voters elect a bicameral Republican majority legislature {{for the first time in}} over a century, North Carolina has also become a Southern swing state in presidential races. Since Southern Democrat Jimmy Carter's comfortable victory in the state in 1976, the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat Barack Obama narrowly won the state in 2008. In the 1990s, Democrat Bill Clinton came within a point of winning the state in 1992 and also only narrowly lost the state in 1996. In the early 2000s, Republican George W. Bush easily won the state by over 12 points, but by 2008, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in heavily populated areas such as the Research Triangle, Charlotte, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Fayetteville, and Asheville, propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In 2012, North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. However, Republican Mitt Romney ultimately eked out a 2-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state that Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with Indiana) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012.|$|E

25|$|Religion {{has always}} {{played a major}} role for both parties, but {{in the course of a}} century, the parties' {{religious}} compositions have changed. Religion was a major dividing line between the parties before 1960, with Catholics, Jews, and Southern Protestants heavily Democratic, and Northeastern Protestants heavily Republican. Most of the old differences faded away after the realignment of the 1970s and 80s that undercut the New Deal coalition. Voters who attend church weekly gave 61% of their votes to Bush in 2004; those who attend occasionally gave him only 47%, while those who never attend gave him 36%. Fifty-nine percent of Protestants voted for Bush, along with 52% of Catholics (even though John Kerry was Catholic). Since 1980, large majorities of evangelicals have voted Republican; 70–80% voted for Bush in 2000 and 2004, and 70% for Republican House candidates in 2006. Jews continue to vote 70–80% Democratic. Democrats have close links with the African American churches, especially the National Baptists, while their historic dominance among Catholic voters has eroded to 54–46 in the 2010 <b>midterms.</b> The main line traditional Protestants (Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Disciples) have dropped to about 55% Republican (in contrast to 75% before 1968). The mainline denominations are rapidly shrinking in size. Mormons in Utah and neighboring states voted 75% or more for Bush in 2000.|$|E

500|$|During September 2008, Ferraro gained {{attention}} {{yet again}} after the announcement of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice-presidential nominee, the first such major party bid for a woman since her own in 1984. Palin mentioned Ferraro as well as Clinton as forerunners in her introductory appearance. In reaction to the nomination, Ferraro said, [...] "It's great to be the first, but I don't {{want to be the}} only. And so now it is wonderful to see a woman on a national ticket." [...] Ferraro speculated that the pick might win Republican presidential nominee John McCain the election, but said that she was supporting Obama now due to his running mate selection of Joe Biden having resolved her concerns about Obama's lack of experience in certain areas. Ferraro criticized the media's scrutiny of Palin's background and family as gender-based and saw parallels with how she was treated by the media during her own run; a University of Alabama study also found that media framing of Ferraro and Palin was similar and often revolved around their nominations being political gambles. A Newsweek cover story detected a change in how women voters responded to a female vice presidential candidate from Ferraro's time to Palin's, but Ferraro correctly predicted that the bounce that McCain received from the Palin pick would dissipate. In a friendly joint retrospective of her 1984 debate with George H. W. Bush, Ferraro said she had had more national issues experience in 1984 than Palin did now, but that it was important that Palin make a good showing in her vice presidential debate so that [...] "little girls [...] see someone there who can stand toe to toe with [...]" [...] McCain and Palin ended up losing, but regardless of the 1984 or 2008 election result, Ferraro said that [...] "Every time a woman runs, women win." [...] Ferraro made a joint appearance with Palin on Fox News during the network's election-night coverage of the 2010 <b>midterms.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a uni ed {{theoretical and empirical}} analysis of three longstanding explanations for the consistent loss {{of support for the}} President's party in <b>midterm</b> Congressional elections: (1) a electoral penalty by voters in <b>midterm</b> elections against the President's party, (2) a surge and decline in voter turnout, and (3) a reversion to the mean in voter ideology. To quantify the contribution of each of these factors, we build an econometric model in which voters jointly choose whether or not to participate and which party to support in both House and Presidential elections. Estimated using ANES data from both Presidential and <b>midterm</b> years, the model can fully explain the observed <b>midterm</b> gaps, and counterfactual simulations demonstrate that each factor makes a sizeable contribution towards the <b>midterm</b> gap...|$|R
