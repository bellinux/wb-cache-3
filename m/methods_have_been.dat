40|$|A simple finite-element-based inverse <b>method</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> devised {{with the}} aim of characterizing the {{properties}} of Isotropic but heterogeneous materials under load. The <b>method</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> implemented into the commercial finite element code ABAQUS via its User Material (UMAT) Subroutine to facilitate the process of material characterization. Verification of the <b>method</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> carried out using simulated examples and the results showed rapid convergence of the method with good accuracy.

5|$|Hidden Markov {{models are}} {{probabilistic}} models that can assign likelihoods to all possible combinations of gaps, matches, and mismatches {{to determine the}} most likely MSA or set of possible MSAs. HMMs can produce a single highest-scoring output but can also generate a family of possible alignments that can then be evaluated for biological significance. HMMs can produce both global and local alignments. Although HMM-based <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> developed relatively recently, they offer significant improvements in computational speed, especially for sequences that contain overlapping regions.|$|E

However, such <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> discontinued in some countries. In Ukraine, for instance, selection tests consist of four olympiads comparable to the IMO by difficulty and schedule. While identifying the winners, only the results of the current selection olympiads are considered.|$|E
5|$|The most fertile period (the {{time with}} the highest {{likelihood}} of pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse) covers the time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after ovulation. In a 28‑day cycle with a 14‑day luteal phase, this corresponds to the second {{and the beginning of}} the third week. A variety of <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> developed to help individual women estimate the relatively fertile and the relatively infertile days in the cycle; these systems are called fertility awareness.|$|E

5|$|A base such as spermine {{has a few}} {{different}} {{sites where}} protonation can occur. In this example the first proton can go on the terminal –NH2 group, or either of the internal –NH– groups. The pKa values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants. They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements. Nevertheless, the site of protonation {{is very important for}} biological function, so mathematical <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> developed for the determination of micro-constants.C NMR Data Processed by the New Computer Program HypNMR2000.

5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more definitively distinguished {{by the absence of}} clamps {{at the base of the}} basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. Molecular <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E
5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Conductive CVD diamond is {{a useful}} {{electrode}} under many circumstances. Photochemical <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> developed for covalently linking DNA {{to the surface of}} polycrystalline diamond films produced through CVD. Such DNA modified films can be used for detecting various biomolecules, which would interact with DNA thereby changing electrical conductivity of the diamond film. In addition, diamonds can be used to detect redox reactions that cannot ordinarily be studied and in some cases degrade redox-reactive organic contaminants in water supplies. Because diamond is mechanically and chemically stable, it can be used as an electrode under conditions that would destroy traditional materials. As an electrode, synthetic diamond can be used in waste water treatment of organic effluents and the production of strong oxidants.|$|E

5|$|<b>Methods</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{developed}} to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to manipulate {{it in the}} laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be transformed into organisms {{in the form of}} plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector. The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.|$|E

Many separation <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used to separate out the neptunium, operating on small and large scales.

5|$|Since {{the first}} modern {{measurements}} of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by Flinders Petrie, various astronomical <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proposed for the original establishment of these orientations. It was recently proposed that this was done by observing the positions of two stars in the Plough / Big Dipper which was known to Egyptians as the thigh. It is thought that a vertical alignment between these two stars checked with a plumb bob was used to ascertain where north lay. The deviations from true north using this model reflect the accepted dates of construction.|$|E

Some earlier third-party titles have compatibility issues when played on the Nomad, but can be successfully played {{through the use of a}} Game Genie. Likewise, due to its lack of compatibility with any of the Genesis' add-ons, it is unable to play any games for the Sega Master System, Sega CD, or Sega 32X.
