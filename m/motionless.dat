5|$|During the day, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are almost}} {{never seen in}} the open, instead resting <b>motionless</b> on the sea floor buried under {{a thin layer of}} sediment that disguises their outlines. At night some individuals remain <b>motionless,</b> waiting for prey, while others may be encountered on the bottom unburied or actively swimming. Large sharks, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) are known to consume Pacific angelsharks. Known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, which infests the skin, the myxosporidian Chloromyxum levigatum, which infests the gall bladder, and the tapeworm Paraberrapex manifestus, which infests the spiral valve intestine. The leech Branchellion lobata may be attached around this shark's cloaca, inside the intestine, and even inside the uterus and on developing embryos.|$|E
5|$|Sur les traces de Tintin (On {{the trail}} of Tintin) (2010) was a five-part {{documentary}} television series which recaps several albums of the book series by combining comic panels (<b>motionless</b> or otherwise) with live-action imagery, with commentary provided.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the equaliser United won another corner, again taken by Beckham. He landed {{the ball on the}} head of Sheringham who nodded it to Solskjær who in turn toe-poked it into the roof of the net. Oliver Kahn, the Bayern goalkeeper, was <b>motionless</b> on the line. United had completed the come-back. Bayern barely had time to restart the game, which referee Collina brought to a close just a few seconds later.|$|E
5|$|Considered {{the most}} {{specialized}} member of its family, the tasselled wobbegong's ornate coloration and complex dermal fringe grants it excellent camouflage, {{while it is}} probably a slower swimmer than related species. It is solitary and spends {{most of the day}} lying <b>motionless</b> inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled up. Individual sharks have a small home range, containing several preferred resting spots that are used repeatedly. This species becomes more active at night, swimming onto the reef to hunt.|$|E
5|$|During daytime, the {{angelshark}} usually lies <b>motionless</b> {{on the sea}} floor, {{buried under}} a layer of sediment with only its eyes showing. At night, it becomes more active, and may sometimes be seen swimming above the bottom. Aggregations numbering up to a hundred have been observed off Gran Canaria in the summer. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Grillotia smaris-gora, G. angeli, and Christianella minuta, the fluke Pseudocotyle squatinae, the monogenean Leptocotyle minor, and the isopod Aega rosacea.|$|E
5|$|Specialist ambush predators of {{visitors}} to flowers include crab spiders, which wait on flowering plants for pollinating insects; predatory bugs, and praying mantises, {{some of which}} (the flower mantises of the tropics) wait <b>motionless,</b> aggressive mimics camouflaged as flowers. Beewolves are large wasps that habitually attack bees; the ethologist Niko Tinbergen estimated that a single colony of the beewolf Philanthus triangulum might kill several thousand honeybees in a day: all the prey he observed were honeybees. Other predatory insects that sometimes catch bees include robber flies and dragonflies.|$|E
5|$|That same night, {{their child}} appears outside and begs {{to be invited}} in. Giorgio is stabbed by his wife while she {{attempts}} to let in her son. On opening the door, she is greeted by Gorca who bites her. Vladimir and Sdenka flee from their home and hide {{in the ruins of}} a cathedral. As Vladimir sleeps, Sdenka walks outside and finds Gorca and his family surrounding her. Vladimir awakens and searches for Sdenka, finding her lying <b>motionless</b> in her bed at home. Sdenka awakens and upon receiving Vladimir's embrace, she bites into his neck.|$|E
5|$|The storm's {{convection}} {{organized around}} a central core, {{and the system}} became a tropical storm on November23 and received the name Delta. An eye-like feature appeared near the storm's circulatory center several times that day. The larger-scale deep-layered cyclonic circulation within which it was embedded steered it on a slow southward and then south-southwesterly track. Strong wind shear prevented immediate development and the system added an eastward component to its drift. Moving out of the high-shear environment on November24, Delta gained organization. Outflow and convective banding increased and an eye feature became well defined. This eye signaled the storm's peak strength of 70mph (110km/h), just below hurricane status. However, the official forecast at the time predicted Delta to strengthen further and become a minimal hurricane. Delta's motion stalled as it reached the southern base of a large cyclonic trough over the northern Atlantic within which it was embedded. Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained <b>motionless</b> for half a day until, that evening when it began a slow southward drift at 6mph (9km/h). Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained <b>motionless</b> for half a day Convection broke down in the storm's western semicircle early on November25; the decreased organization caused slight weakening. Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained <b>motionless</b> for half a day The southward motion slowed and the weakening trend continued into the evening. Cooling cold tops were counteracted by wind shear which exposed most of the low-level center. The storm's southward motion stopped and it began moving east at 6mph (9km/h). Some of the computer models suggested the weakening tropical storm could be absorbed by a developing low to the west, which {{a few days later}} became Hurricane Epsilon. This did not occur, and Tropical Storm Delta began to move to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|When a male detects a female, it chases {{the female}} and begins courtship. Females are larger and slower than males, and many males will escort and intertwine around a single female. The males then align their bodies {{with the female}} and rhythmically contract; the {{resulting}} mass of snakes can remain nearly <b>motionless</b> for several days. After courtship, the snakes copulate for about {{an average of two}} hours.|$|E
5|$|When hunting a {{web spider}} in the prey's web, a P. schultzi walks very slowly towards the prey and then, when {{two to three}} {{centimetres}} away, pauses for some minutes. During this time the P. schultzi quivers very quickly with its whole body at regular intervals. In almost all cases the prey stays <b>motionless.</b> P. schultzi never plucks the web as Portia fimbriata does.|$|E
5|$|A test in 1997 {{showed that}} P. fimbriata′s {{preferences}} for {{different types of}} prey are in the order: web spiders; jumping spiders; and insects. These preferences apply to both live prey and <b>motionless</b> lures, and to P. fimbriata specimens without prey for 7days ("well-fed") and without prey for 14days ("starved"). P. fimbriata specimens without prey for 21days ("extra-starved") showed no preference for different types of prey. The test included as prey several species of web spiders and jumping spiders, and {{the selection of the}} prey species showed no evidence of affecting the results. Insects were represented by the house fly Musca domestica.|$|E
5|$|A test in 1997 {{showed that}} P. labiata from the Philippines and from Sri Lanka have similar {{preferences}} for {{different types of}} prey, and that the order of preference is: web spiders; jumping spiders; and insects. These preferences apply to both live prey and <b>motionless</b> lures, and to P. labiata specimens without prey for 7days ("well-fed") and without prey for 14days ("starved"). P. labiata specimens without prey for 21days ("extra-starved") showed no preference for different types of prey. The test included as prey several species of web spiders and jumping spiders, and {{the selection of the}} prey species showed no evidence of affecting the results. Insects were represented by the house fly Musca domestica.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After the routine maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper <b>motionless</b> for several hours on the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
5|$|Bohor reedbuck {{are active}} {{throughout}} the day, seeking cover during the daytime and grazing in the night. A {{large proportion of}} the whole day is spent on feeding and vigilance. They can easily camouflage in grasses and reeds, and hide themselves rather than running from danger. When threatened, they usually remain <b>motionless</b> or retreat slowly into cover for defense, but if the threat is close, they flee, whistling shrilly to alert the others. It hides from predators rather than forming herds in defense. Many predators, including lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, African wild dogs and Nile crocodiles, prey on the reedbuck.|$|E
5|$|Ellen {{attempts}} to flee but is severely beaten by the possessed Bruce, who throws {{her around the}} cabin. While being strangled, Ellen picks up Bruce's mutilated hand which is still holding the dagger found from before, and she uses it to stab Bruce. A large amount of blood is expended by Bruce, who lies <b>motionless</b> for a moment, only to then continue his assault on Ellen. Ellen mutilates Bruce's body even further with an axe, chopping off nearly every limb from the writhing body. Severely disturbed by the things she has witnessed, Ellen rocks back and forth muttering to herself. The corpse of Scotty suddenly springs up, before turning towards the oblivious Ellen, ready to attack. The screen then cuts to black, leaving the fate of Ellen ambiguous.|$|E
5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} <b>motionless,</b> a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to {{one side or the other}} and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E
5|$|Madonna premiered {{the song}} at a benefit concert at Madison Square Garden {{to raise money}} for medical {{research}} for AIDS. She dedicated the song to the memory of her friend, artist Martin Burgoyne. Madonna has since performed the song on three of her world tours. In 1987, during the Who's That Girl World Tour, she performed the song standing <b>motionless</b> in a single spotlight, wearing a black ensemble with tassels, golden tips and ribbing, designed by Marlene Stewart. Two different performances of the song on this tour {{can be found on the}} videos: Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987, and , filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.|$|E
5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect and his eyes were colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes <b>motionless</b> underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E
5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are made ineffective by movement: a deer or grasshopper may be highly cryptic when <b>motionless,</b> but instantly seen when it moves. But one method, motion dazzle, requires rapidly moving bold patterns of contrasting stripes. Motion dazzle may degrade predators' ability {{to estimate the}} prey's speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Motion dazzle distorts speed perception and is most effective at high speeds; stripes can also distort perception of size (and so, perceived range to the target). As of 2011, motion dazzle had been proposed for military vehicles, but never applied. Since motion dazzle patterns would make animals more difficult to locate accurately when moving, but easier to see when stationary, {{there would be an}} evolutionary trade-off between motion dazzle and crypsis.|$|E
5|$|She was recommissioned {{for service}} on 31 March 1941, {{after which the}} Kriegsmarine {{initially}} planned to send the ship on the commerce raiding operation planned the previous year. Her sister Admiral Scheer was to join Lützow for the operation, and on 12 June, she departed for Norway with an escort of destroyers. British torpedo bombers attacked the ship off Egersund and scored a single hit that disabled her electrical system and rendered the ship <b>motionless.</b> She took on a severe list to port and the port shaft was damaged. The crew effected emergency repairs that allowed her to return to Germany; repair work in Kiel lasted for six months. By 10 May 1942, the ship was finally pronounced ready for action.|$|E
5|$|The European {{nightjar}}, Eurasian nightjar or just nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) is a crepuscular and {{nocturnal bird}} in the nightjar family that breeds across most of Europe and temperate Asia. The Latin generic name refers to the old myth that the nocturnal nightjar suckled goats, causing them to cease to give milk. The six subspecies differ clinally, the birds becoming smaller and paler towards {{the east of the}} range. All populations are migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes individuals difficult to see in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch <b>motionless</b> along a branch, although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail as he flies at night.|$|E
5|$|The Tasmanian {{numbfish}} is {{a fairly}} inactive species that spends {{long periods of time}} buried <b>motionless</b> in sediment. It feeds primarily on polychaete worms (particularly those of the family Maldanidae) and crustaceans (including amphipods, decapods, and tanaids). Nematodes and sipunculids may also be consumed on rare occasions. Juvenile rays consume polychaetes and crustaceans in roughly equal proportions, while adults consume mostly polychaetes. This dietary shift may reflect increasing experience with age, as polychaetes are burrowing animals and thus more difficult to locate and capture than crustaceans. Like other members of its family, the Tasmanian numbfish can defend itself with a modest electric shock. Its predators include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). The tapeworm Anthobothrium hickmani is a parasite of this species.|$|E
5|$|To learn whether errors {{actually}} {{existed in}} Lilienthal's data tables, the brothers used a bicycle {{for a new}} type of experiment. They made a model-size airfoil and a counter-acting flat plate, both according to dimensions Lilienthal had specified, and attached them to an extra bicycle wheel, which they mounted horizontally in front of the handlebars. Pedaling strenuously on a local street to create airflow over the apparatus, they observed that the third wheel rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining <b>motionless</b> as Lilienthal's formula predicted. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of lift and drag–or all of them–were in error.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Portia species, P. fimbriata in Queensland readily invades {{the nests}} of cursorial spiders, {{plucking}} or cutting the nest. If the resident spider eventually leaves the nest, P. fimbriata stalks it. If the resident spider tries to counterattack and then retreats into the nest, P. fimbriata may attack the other spider as it re-enters the nest, or may wait <b>motionless</b> until the prey exits. If a stabbed prey spider retreats into the nest, P. fimbriata in Queensland never enters the nest, but {{waits for the}} prey to move out, and then P. fimbriata kills it.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, the blackmouth {{catshark}} {{is one of}} the most abundant sharks over the upper and middle continental slope. It is nomadic in nature and may be found alone or in groups. Relatively slow, this shark swims with strong eel-like (anguilliform) undulations of its body. It often cruises just above the sea floor, perhaps taking advantage of the ground effect (a reduction in the drag on a wing when close to the ground) to save energy. It has also been seen resting <b>motionless</b> on the bottom. Known predators of the {{blackmouth catshark}} include the kitefin shark (Dalatias licha) and the European flying squid (Todarodes sagittatus). Parasites that have been documented from this species include the tapeworm Ditrachybothridium macrocephalum and the protist Eimeria palavensis.|$|E
5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} nocturnal and {{spend most of}} the day resting <b>motionless</b> on the sea floor. At night, they {{actively}} hunt for molluscs, crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes inside holes and crevices in the reef. Though solitary for most of the year, they form large seasonal aggregations. The zebra shark is oviparous: females produce several dozen large egg capsules, which they anchor to underwater structures via adhesive tendrils. Innocuous to humans and hardy in captivity, zebra sharks are popular subjects of ecotourism dives and public aquaria. The World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered worldwide, as it is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range (except off Australia) for meat, fins, and liver oil. There is evidence that its numbers are dwindling.|$|E
5|$|Clearing Johnston Atoll, John {{turned to}} the {{northwest}} and began strengthening again as shear decreased. On August 27 local time, John reached a secondary peak strength of 135 miles per hour (210 km/h), and shortly thereafter it crossed the International Date Line at approximately 22° N and came under the surveillance of the Guam branch of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). By crossing into the western Pacific, John also became a typhoon and {{was referred to as}} Typhoon John during its time in the western Pacific. Immediately after crossing the Date Line, John again weakened and its forward motion stalled. By September 1, John had weakened to a tropical storm and was nearly <b>motionless</b> just west of the Date Line. There, John lingered for six days while performing a multi-day counterclockwise loop. On September 7, a trough moved into the area and quickly moved John to the northeast. John crossed the Date Line again on September 8 and reentered the central Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are {{on their hands and}} knees in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and <b>motionless</b> for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E
5|$|He {{is said to}} have meditated <b>motionless</b> in a {{standing}} posture (kayotsarga) for a year, during which time climbing plants grew around his legs. However, he was adamant and continued his practice unmindful of the vines, ants, and dust that enveloped his body. According to Jain text Ādi purāṇa, {{on the last day of}} Bahubali's one year long fast, Bharata came in all humility to Bahubali and worshiped him with veneration and respect. A painful regret that he had been the cause of his elder brother's humiliation had been disturbing Bahubali's meditation; this was dispersed when Bharata worshipped him. Bahubali was then able to destroy the four kinds of inimical karmas, including the knowledge obscuring karma, and he attained omniscience (kevala gyana). He was now revered as an omniscient being (Kevali). Bahubali finally attained liberation (moksha) and became a pure, liberated soul (siddha). He is said to be the first Digambara monk to have attained moksha in the present half-cycle of time (Avasarpiṇī).|$|E
5|$|Like all Australasian robins, {{the flame}} robin is a perch and pounce hunter, mainly eating insects, and often {{returning}} to a favourite low perch several times to stand erect and <b>motionless,</b> scanning the leaf-litter for more prey. They are typically seen in pairs (during {{the spring and summer}} breeding season) or in loose companies in more open country in winter, when they more commonly feed on the ground. A field study in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales found no significant difference in foraging behaviour between male and female flame robins. Birds have been recorded foraging for insects in furrows in freshly ploughed fields. In Deniliquin, a flame robin was observed holding one foot forward and pattering the ground repeatedly to disturb ground-dwelling insects, and then watching and snapping up any which emerged; this behaviour is otherwise seen in waders.|$|E
5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} {{observed}} in captivity {{and in the}} wild are most active during the day. In captivity, the loggerheads' daily activities are divided between swimming and resting on the bottom. While resting, they spread their forelimbs to about midstroke swimming position. They remain <b>motionless</b> with eyes open or half-shut and are easily alerted during this state. At night, captives sleep {{in the same position}} with their eyes tightly shut, and are slow to react. Loggerheads spend up to 85% of their day submerged, with males being the more active divers than females. The average duration of dives is 15–30 min, but they can stay submerged for up to four hours. Juvenile loggerheads and adults differ in their swimming methods. A juvenile keeps its forelimbs pressed to the side of its carapace, and propels itself by kicking with its hind limbs. As the juvenile matures, its swimming method is progressively replaced with the adult's alternating-limb method. They depend entirely on this method of swimming by one year old.|$|E
5|$|Matthews died on 23 February 2000, aged 85, {{after falling}} ill while on holiday in Tenerife. Mila had died the {{previous}} year. It was {{a recurrence of}} an illness that he first suffered in 1997. His death was announced on the radio just {{before the start of}} an England v Argentina friendly match. He was cremated following a funeral service in Stoke on 3 March 2000. His funeral was attended by many of his fellow footballers, such as Bobby Charlton and Jack Charlton, Gordon Banks, Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney. His ashes were buried beneath the centre circle of Stoke City's Britannia Stadium, which he had officially opened in August 1997. After his death, more than 100,000 people lined the streets of Stoke-on-Trent to pay tribute. As the cortège wound its way along the 12-mile route, employees downed tools and schoolchildren stood <b>motionless</b> to witness his final passing.|$|E
5|$|Neurophysiologists {{study the}} chemical, pharmacological, and {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases {{where there was a}} medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain <b>motionless</b> for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.|$|E
5|$|Rancho Grande {{was located}} at a {{mountain}} pass in {{a branch of}} the Andes known as the Venezuelan Coastal Range, which was an important migration route for butterflies, and the station proved very lucrative in the study of insects. During his work at Rancho Grande, Beebe broke his leg in a fall from a ladder, and the forced immobility which resulted from having his leg in a cast presented him with a new opportunity for observing the area's wildlife. At his request, he and his chair were transported into the nearby jungle, and as he sat <b>motionless</b> the wild animals around him soon began to go about their business without noticing his presence. His immobility also presented him with the opportunity to spend hours at a time observing a pair of bat falcons through binoculars, documenting the behavior of their two chicks and every prey item fed to them by their parents. His observations documented several behaviors which were new to science, including the first documented example of play in birds.|$|E
