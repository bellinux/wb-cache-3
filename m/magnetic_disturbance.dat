By {{the method}} of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) the {{connection}} of <b>magnetic</b> <b>disturbances</b> in auroral region and mid and low latitude <b>magnetic</b> <b>disturbances</b> at the main phase of a geomagnetic storm is investigated. The search of nonlinear correlations between indices of auroral electrojets intensity (AU, AL) and indices of a ring current intensity (SYM, ASY) confirms a well-known relationship between westward electrojet and asymmetric part of the ring current as well as eastward electrojet and symmetric part. The opportunity of comprehensible neural network recovery of auroral elecrojets intensity indices according to indices of a ring current intensity is proved. Characteristic quantities of forestalling times in development of mid-latitude magnetospheric processes relatively polar processes are determined. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{important}} {{characteristic of}} turbulent reconnection {{is that it}} combines large scale <b>magnetic</b> <b>disturbances</b> (δ B/B ∼ 1) with randomly distributed Unstable Current Sheets (UCSs). Many well known non linear MHD structures (strong turbulence, current sheet(s), shock(s)) lead asymptotically {{to the state of}} turbulent reconnection. We analyze in this article, for the first time, the energization of electrons and ions in a large scale environment that combines large amplitude disturbances propagating with sub-Alfvénic speed with UCSs. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>disturbances</b> interact stochastically (second order Fermi) with the charged particles and they {{play a crucial role in}} the heating of the particles, while the UCS interact systematically (first order Fermi) and play a crucial role in the formation of the high energy tail. The synergy of stochastic and systematic acceleration provided by the mixture of <b>magnetic</b> <b>disturbances</b> and UCSs influences the energetics of the thermal and non-thermal particles, the power law index, and the time the particles remain inside the energy release volume.
