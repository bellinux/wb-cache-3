5|$|Reflecting on {{the twentieth}} anniversary of its release in a {{retrospective}} article on Salon.com, film commentator Scott Mendelson noted the continuing impact that Batman {{has had on}} the motion film industry, including the increasing importance of opening weekend box office receipts; the narrowing window between a film's debut and its video release that caused the demise of second-run movie theaters; the accelerated acquisition of pre-existing, pre-sold properties for film adaptations that can be readily leveraged for <b>merchandizing</b> tie-ins; {{the primacy of the}} MPAA PG-13 as the target rating for film producers; and more off-beat, non-traditional casting opportunities for genre films.|$|E
5|$|The anime {{adaptation}} {{has been}} compared to Sailor Moon due to both having female protagonists; five original team members with signature colors and powers, and similar plot lines. Tokyo Mew Mew received high ratings in Japan with extensive <b>merchandizing</b> tie ins and marketing events to promote the series. When 4Kids announced their licensing of the anime, heavily edited and localized, fans of the series were openly dismayed and began multiple campaigns to convince the company to release an uncut version of the series. After previews of the retooled series were released, viewers were less disappointed, but still annoyed by the cultural shifting and still desired an uncut DVD release. Mew Mew Power became a successful broadcast series for 4Kids, becoming the highest rated 4Kids show {{at the start of the}} fall 2005 season, but it was never released to DVD in North America. The 4Kids dub, rather than original Japanese version, was subsequently licensed for broadcast in France, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Greece, South Africa and Israel.|$|E

2500|$|A related {{contemporary}} ideology, consumerism, {{which encourages}} the personal acquisition {{of goods and}} services, also drives globalization. [...] Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of consumer education into school curricula. Social activists hold materialism is connected to global retail <b>merchandizing</b> and supplier convergence, war, greed, anomie, crime, environmental degradation, and general social malaise and discontent. One variation on this topic is activism by postconsumers, with the strategic emphasis on moving beyond addictive consumerism.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis work aims at {{proposing a}} new {{organization}} of urban <b>merchandize</b> distribution based on mutualized and optimized resources. In this context, our contribution is twofold. On one hand, we develop {{a set of}} models to manage <b>merchandize</b> distribution. We develop a new reservation system that enables customers to request a <b>merchandize</b> transportation service (delivery and collect) or to book a vehicle for self-service purposes. Requests are processed by two main decision modules (1) an online module that immediately searches for a feasible solution for a request, and decides to accept or reject it, and (2) an offline module that looks for optimized solutions starting from the feasible schedule defined by the online module. On the other hand, we develop a new discrete event simulator, called MODUMS which integrates the proposed models, implements such a logistic system and evaluates its economic and environmental impact. MODUMS takes as inputs realistic information about the transportation means, geographic data and demand information requests that are generated according to some probability distributions. It gives as outputs indicators {{on the impact of}} mutualization on the quality of urban logistics in terms of, for example, number of delayed or rejected requests, filling rate of vehicles, total distance and quantity of CO 2...|$|R
