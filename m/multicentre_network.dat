40|$|BackgroundExisting Australasian and {{international}} guidelines outline antibiotic and antifungal measures {{to prevent the}} development of treatment-related infection in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Practice patterns and rates of PD-related infection vary widely across renal units in Australia and New Zealand and are known to vary significantly from guideline recommendations, resulting in PD technique survival rates that are lower than those achieved in many other countries. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if there is an association between current practice and PD-related infection outcomes and to identify the barriers and enablers to good clinical practice. MethodsThis is a <b>multicentre</b> <b>network</b> study involving eight PD units in Australia and New Zealand, with a focus on adherence to guideline recommendations on antimicrobial prophylaxis in PD patients. Current practice was established by asking the PD unit heads to respond to a short survey about practice/protocols/policies and a 2 ̆ 7 process map 2 ̆ 7 was constructed following a face-to-face interview with the primary PD nurse at each unit. The perceived barriers/enablers to adherence to the relevant guideline recommendations were obtained from the completion of 2 ̆ 7 cause and effect 2 ̆ 7 diagrams by the nephrologist and PD nurse at each unit. Data on PD-related infections were obtained for the period 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011. ResultsPerceived barriers that may result in reduced adherence to guideline recommendations included lack of knowledge, procedural lapses, lack of a centralized patient database, patients with non-English speaking background, professional concern about antibiotic resistance, medication cost and the inability of nephrologists and infectious diseases staff to reach consensus on unit protocols. The definitions of PD-related infections used by some units varied from those recommended by the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis, particularly with exit-site infection (ESI). Wide variations were observed in the rates of ESI (0. 06 - 0. 53 episodes per patient-year) and peritonitis (0. 31 - 0. 86 episodes per patient-year). ConclusionsDespite the existence of strongly evidence-based guideline recommendations, there was wide variation in adherence to these recommendations between PD units which might contribute to PD-related infection rates, which varied widely between units. Although individual patient characteristics may account for some of this variability, inconsistencies in the processes of care to prevent infection in PD patients also play a role...|$|E
40|$|Severe {{cutaneous}} {{adverse reactions}} (SCARs) encompass a heterogeneous group of delayed hypersensitivity reactions, which {{are most frequently}} caused by drugs. Our understanding of several aspects of SCAR syndromes has evolved considerably over the previous decade. This review explores evolving knowledge on the immunopathogenic mechanisms, pharmacogenomic associations, in-vivo and ex-vivo diagnostics for causality assessment and medication cross-reactivity data related to SCAR syndromes. Given the rarity and severity of these diseases, multidisciplinary collaboration through large international, national and/or <b>multicentre</b> <b>networks</b> to collect prospective data on patients with SCAR syndromes should be prioritized. This will further enhance a systematised framework for translating epidemiological, clinical, and immunopathogenetic advances into preventive efforts and improved outcomes for patients...|$|R
40|$|Fracture non-unions often complicate {{orthopaedic}} trauma. BMPs (bone morphogenetic proteins) {{are currently}} {{considered the most}} appealing osteoinductive agents. Applications of BMP- 7 since January 2004 were prospectively recorded in a multicentre registry of aseptic femoral non-unions. The study included 30 patients who had undergone a median of 1 revision operation before BMP- 7 application and who were followed up for a median 24 months. In 23 / 30 cases the application of BMP- 7 was combined with revision of the fixation, and in 12 it was combined also with autograft. Non-union healing was verified in 26 / 30 cases in a median period of 6 months. No adverse events were associated with BMP- 7 application. Our case series supports the safety and efficacy of BMP- 7 in femoral non-unions. <b>Multicentre</b> <b>networks</b> and systematic, long-term follow-up of patients may improve understanding of this promising osteoinductive bone substitute...|$|R
40|$|The risk of {{agranulocytosis}} {{associated with}} anti-arrhythmic drugs has been assessed by studying previous drug exposure {{of all cases}} collected through a <b>multicentre</b> surveillance <b>network</b> in a defined geographical area during the period 1980 - 1988. One hundred and eighty-one patients with agranulocytosis (< 500 granulocytes mm~ 3 at least in two different blood counts) were interviewed with a structured questionnaire. Eight cases attributable to anti-arrhythmic drugs were identified, all of them related to aprindine. Data on the consumption of several anti-arrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, aprindine, quinidine•, propafenone) were obtained in order to estimate the risk of agranulocytosis related with the previous use of these drugs. A relevant risk was identified only for aprindine, {{of the order of}} two cases per 1000 patient-years. Our data suggest that the risk of agranulocytosis associated with aprindine is lower than previously found...|$|R
30|$|The {{nature and}} {{complexity}} of BD mean that successful translational research requires the integration of advances in clinical and basic science to develop targeted treatments that are more specific for BD. However, improving {{research in the field}} of severe and complex disorders increasingly requires the development of a critical mass of expertise through broadly based collaborative <b>networks.</b> <b>Multicentre</b> projects maximise the likelihood of recruitment of large clinical cohorts that reflect the heterogeneity of the disorder and facilitate cross-national epidemiological studies, as well as providing subgroups with adequate statistical power to explore pathophysiological and gene-environment interactions and to conduct clinical trials. This type of research is only usually achievable through {{the development and implementation of}} shared research protocols across a large number of centres (Vieta et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|A {{child with}} complex {{congenital}} heart disease in 2008 is very likely to survive a series of surgical and medical interventions, and confront an array of medical and psychosocial stressors that are presently poorly understood. As approaches to medical problems change, careful assessment of those results is essential, and the initial work of the <b>multicentre</b> Pediatric Heart <b>Network</b> is a huge {{step in the right}} direction, setting the stage for proper controlled trials of therapies. Major complications, notably ventricular failure, rhythm problems and thromboembolism, will affect nearly one-quarter of survivors, necessitating further interventions. Appropriate educational and psychosocial support for these children and their families is the next challenge for {{all of us in the}} field of paediatrics. How ironic would it be to have invested so much in early survival, only to allow the child to fail in life itself...|$|R
40|$|Sir, We {{read with}} {{interest}} the study by Koh et al., which continues the discussion on the safety and efficacy of linezolid {{in the treatment of}} multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB). The topic is very important as clinicians seek to optimize the few available choices in treating MDR- and XDR-TB patients. We recently presented the results of a comprehensive, <b>multicentre</b> TBNET (TuBerculosis <b>Network</b> European Trials Group) evaluation of linezolid tolerability and long-term efficacy for the treatment of MDR- and XDR-TB. This study highlighted the risk of adverse events when the standard dosage of 600 mg twice daily that is recommended for infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is administered over longer periods of time. After 32 weeks of treatment with linezolid at a dosage of 600 mg twice daily, > 50...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Community-acquired {{pneumonia}} (CAP) is {{now most}} frequent in elderly patients. CAP {{in the younger}} patient has attracted much less attention. Therefore, we compared patients with CAP aged 18 to, 65 yrs with those aged o 65 yrs. Data from the prospective <b>multicentre</b> Competence <b>Network</b> for Community Acquired Pneumonia Study Group (CAPNETZ) database were analysed for potential differences in baseline characteristics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, microbial investigations, aetiologies, anti-microbial treatment and outcomes. Overall, 7, 803 patients were studied. The proportion of younger patients (aged, 65 yrs) was 52. 3 % (18 to, 30 yrs 6. 4 %;, 40 yrs 17. 1 %;, 50 yrs 29. 4 %). Comorbidity was present in {{only half of the}} younger patients (46. 6 % versus 88. 2 %). Fever and chest pain were more common. Most younger patients presented with mild CAP (74. 0 % had a CURB- 65 score of 0 (confusion of new onset, urea. 7 mmol?L- 1, respiratory rate of o 30 breaths?min- 1, blood pressure, 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure f 60 mmHg, age o 65 yrs)). Overall, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were the most frequent pathogens in the younger patients. Short-term mortality was very low (1. 7 % versus 8. 2 %) and even lower in patients without comorbidity (0. 3 % versus 2. 4 %). Long-term mortality was 3. 2 % versus 15. 9 %, also lower in patients without comorbidity (0. 8 % versus 6. 1 %). Most of the differences found clearly arise after the fifth or within the middle of the sixth decade. CAP in the younger patient is a clinically distinct entity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceObjectives: The {{relation}} between C-Reactive Protein (CRP), depression ă and antidepressant consumption {{has been well}} explored in major ă depressive disorders but not in schizophrenia, which has {{a high rate of}} ă depression comorbidity. The objectives of this study were: (i) to ă determine the prevalence of abnormal CRP levels, depression and ă antidepressant consumption in a multicenter community-dwelling sample of ă subjects with schizophrenia (ii) to determine the association between ă abnormal CRP levels, depression and antidepressant consumption in ă schizophrenia. ă Method: 219 stable patients with schizophrenia (mean age= 31. 6 years, ă 75. 3 % male gender) were systematically included in the <b>multicentre</b> ă <b>network</b> of FondaMental Expert Center for schizophrenia (FACESZ) and ă assessed with a dedicated electronic medical record including the ă Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and Calgary ă Depression Scale for depression. High sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) was ă measured with an assay using nephelometry (Dade Behring). Abnormal CRP ă level was defined by levels > 3 mg/L. Current medication was recorded. ă Results: Overall, 63 subjects (28. 8 %) were found to have abnormal CRP ă levels, 43 (20. 1 %) received a diagnosis of comorbid current depression, ă and 51 (31. 9 %) had ongoing antidepressant treatment. In univariate ă analysis, abnormal CRP levels were found to be significantly associated ă with body mass index (BMI) (p 0. 05). ă In a multivariate model, abnormal CRP was associated with antidepressant ă consumption independently of other confounding variables (adjusted Odds ă Ratio = 2. 8, 95 % confidence interval 1. 226. 62). Metabolic syndrome was ă also independently associated with abnormal CRP (adjusted Odds Ratio = ă 2. 6, 95 % confidence interval 1. 01 - 6. 71). ă Conclusion: Abnormal CRP levels in schizophrenia were found to be ă associated with antidepressant consumption, but not with depression. The ă potential mechanisms were discussed. Antidepressant consumption should ă be systematically recorded in future studies exploring inflammation in ă schizophrenia. Future clinical trials of interventions directed at ă lowering the level of CRP and other inflammatory markers are discussed. ă (c) 2015 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Obsessive-compulsive {{and related}} {{disorders}} (O-CRDs) are highly disabling psychiatric illnesses of early-onset. They {{are responsible for}} considerable morbidity and socioeconomic burden. Existing treatments are usually only partially successful {{and there is an}} urgent need to understand the aetiological factors and neurobiological bases of the disorders in order to develop new and more effective strategies for prevention, early detection and effective treatment. Emerging data from the neurosciences supports the reconceptualisation of obsessive-compulsive disorder as a spectrum disorder, related to but different from the anxiety disorders and closely aligned with other less well understood psychiatric disorders characterised by compulsive acts such as body dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania, skin-picking disorder, hoarding disorder; and possibly extending to tic disorders and other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. A new, O-CRDs research network, supported by the Networks Initiative of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology and comprising leading figures in preclinical and clinical research, has been established. It aims to provide a European perspective on the current debate around internationally-accepted diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies for O-CRDs. Its objectives include; (1) identifying the key outstanding research questions that depend upon cross-centre collaborative investigation, (2) setting a research agenda that is likely to produce an impact on health-outcomes, and (3) strengthening existing projects and collaborative enterprises with these objectives in mind. This paper reviews some of these critical research priorities. By establishing shared multinational databases, collaborative research <b>networks,</b> <b>multicentre</b> studies and joint publications, it is hoped that progress will be achieve...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To explore peri-implant health (and {{relation}} with periodontal status) 4 - 5 years after implant insertion. Study D esign: A practice-based dental research <b>network</b> <b>multicentre</b> study {{was performed in}} 11 Spanish centres. The first patient/month with implant insertion in 2004 was considered. Per patient four teeth (one per quadrant) showing the highest bone loss in the 2004 panoramic X-ray were selected for periodontal status assessment. Bone losses in implants were calculated as the differences between 2004 and 2009 bone levels in radiographs. Results: A total of 117 patients were included. Of the 408 teeth considered, 73 (17. 9 %) were lost in 2009 (losing risk: > 50 % for bone losses ? 7 mm). A total of 295 implants were reviewed. Eight of 117 (6. 8 %) patients had lost implants (13 of 295 implants installed; 4. 4 %). Implant loss rate (quadrant status) was 1. 4 % (edentulous), 3. 6 % (preserved teeth), and 11. 1 % (lost teeth) (p= 0. 037). The percentage of implant loss significantly (p< 0. 001) increased when the medial/distal bone loss was ? 3 mm. The highest (p? 0. 001) pocket depths were found in teeth with ? 5 mm and implants with ? 3 mm bone losses, with similar mean values (? 4 mm), associated with higher rates of plaque index and bleeding by probing. Conclusions: The significant bi-directional relation between plaque and bone loss, and between each of these two parameters/signs and pocket depths or bleeding (both in teeth and implants, and between them) together with the higher percentage of implants lost when the bone loss of the associated teeth was ? 3 mm suggest that the patient?s periodontal status is a critical issue in predicting implant health/lesion...|$|R
