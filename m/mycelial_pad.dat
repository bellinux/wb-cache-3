30|$|Genomic DNA (gDNA) of S. fimicola was {{extracted}} following slight {{modifications of}} a previously described protocol (Pitkin et al. 1996). The strains were grown on cellophane-covered malt extract agar I medium, and mycelia grown on the cellophane were peeled and dipped into liquid nitrogen. The <b>mycelial</b> <b>pad</b> was ground into powder using {{a mortar and}} pestle with liquid nitrogen. The fine powder was homogenized in 500  µl DNA extraction buffer [l 00  mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 % hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), 1.4  M NaCl, 20  mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 2 % polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP- 40) and 1 % mercaptoethanol] and then incubated for 1  h at 65  °C. The cell lysate was extracted with the same volume of phenol:chloroform (1 : 1) and centrifuged at 13, 200  rpm, 4  °C for 15  min, and the supernatants were saved for subsequent chloroform extraction. DNA was precipitated by adding isopropanol and incubated for 15  min at 25  °C. DNA was harvested by centrifuging at 12, 000  rpm, 4  °C for 10  min. The pellet was washed with 70 % ethanol and collected by centrifugation. The DNA pellet was air-dried and re-suspended in sterile distilled water.|$|E
40|$|An action {{spectrum}} for light induced carotenogenesis in V. agaricinum (Link) Corda (ATCC 24668) {{was obtained by}} exposing <b>mycelial</b> <b>pads</b> to monochromatic radiation. Action maxima occurred at 290 (main peak) and 390 nm {{and there was a}} minor peak at 483 nm. An interaction between the blue and UV light occurred. Blue light partly reversed the UV light induction of carotenogenesis when given after, but not when given before UV light. This implies that there are at least 2 photoreceptors involved in carotenogenesis in Verticillium, but phytochrome {{is not likely to be}} one of them...|$|R
40|$|An action {{spectrum}} for light-induced carotenoid biosynthesis in Neurospora crassa was determined in 4 to 20 nm steps from 260 to 800 nm. Four-day, dark-grown <b>mycelial</b> <b>pads</b> of N. crassa {{were exposed to}} varying amounts of monochromatic radiant energy and time. After a 48 -hour incubation period at 6 C, carotenoid content was assayed spectrophotometrically in vivo. The {{action spectrum}} has maxima at 450 and 481 nm in the visible range and at 280 and 370 nm in the ultraviolet. A pigment synthesized by Neurospora whose absorption spectrum resembles the action spectrum is β-carotene...|$|R
50|$|Regarding the pathogenesis, Glue Crust {{essentially}} glues dead twigs {{to living}} branches in the canopy, which prevents the dead twigs from {{falling to the}} ground. If they fell to the ground, they {{would be available to}} be decomposed by other fungi. Hymenochaete corruguta’s individual genotypes can accomplish this gluing by making sclerotized <b>mycelial</b> <b>pads</b> that form a bridge binding the twigs together from various stools. The pads created can also allow for attachment to other trees, not just twigs in the same tree. The fungus essentially can go back and forth between different modes of mycelial development and producing melanized pseudosclerotial plates, and then spreads from branch to branch through these glued together pseudosclerotia.|$|R
40|$|A protein methylase III {{responsible}} for specifically methylating the cytochrome c in Neurospora crassa was partially characterized by using unmethylated horse heart cytochrome c as a substrate. This enzyme utilizes S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor. An {{analysis of the}} distribution of [14 C]methyl groups in the peptides obtained by chymotrypsin digestion of the enzymically methylated cytochrome c showed that all of the radioactivity could be recovered within a single peak after chromatography. This indicates that the enzyme methylates a specific amino acid sequence within cytochrome c. On hydrolysis of the radioactive chymotryptic peptide, Me- 14 C-labelled epsilon -N-mono-methyl-lysine, epsilon-N-dimethyl-lysine and epsilon-N-trimethyl-lysine were identified. The enzyme can easily be extracted from the N. crassa <b>mycelial</b> <b>pads</b> and was purified approx. 30 -fold...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which acetate and related compounds are oxidized by fungi has been a sub-ject of discussion for many years (Foster, 1949; Chain, 1956). In 1919 Raistrick and Clark sug-gested that citrate might be synthesized by a condensation of oxalacetate and acetate. Subse-quently, various organic acids were shown to accumulate when two-carbon compounds are metabolized by washed fungal cells; for example, Chrzaszcz et al. (1932) indicated that acetate, glycolate, malate, succinate, fumarate, citrate, and oxalate were produced when ethanol was added to washed <b>mycelial</b> <b>pads</b> of various species of the genus Penicillium. For years some of these organic acids {{were thought to be}} intermediates in the oxidation of carbohydrates to C 02 and water. After studies with animal tissues had re-vealed the importance of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle as a mechanism for terminal oxida-tion (Krebs, 1940), attention again was focused on the role of this pathway in the fungi. Chain (1956) offers a comprehensive review of work in this field. Most of the data mentioned in Chain's review show that citrate is formed via a C 2 plus 04 con-densation, most likely as is visualized by th...|$|R
40|$|Previous work on {{circadian}} {{rhythms of}} Neurospora crassa {{has been done}} almost exclusively with cultures expressing rhythmic conidiation and growing on solid agar medium. Such conditions severely restrict the kinds of biochemical experiments that can be carried out. We have now developed systems which allow indirect assay of circadian rhythmicity in liquid culture. Neurospora was grown in glucose and acetate liquid media under conditions which result {{in a range of}} growth rates and morphologies. Liquid media were inoculated with conidia and the cultures were grown in constant light for 33 or 48 hours, by which time floating <b>mycelial</b> <b>pads</b> had formed. Experimental pieces of mycelium then were cut and placed in fresh new liquid medium. As controls, other pieces of mycelium were cut and put directly on solid agar medium in race tubes. All cultures were transferred to constant darkness at this time. This light-to-dark transition set the phase of the circadian clock of both the liquid and solid cultures. At various times after the light-to-dark transition, the mycelial pieces in the liquid were transferred in the dark to solid medium in race tubes, where they grew normally and conidiated rhythmically. Comparison of the phase of the rhythm in these race tubes to the controls demonstrated that, under appropriate conditions, the circadian clock of the liquid cultures functions normally for at least two cycles in constant conditions. Using these culture systems, a significantly greater variety of biochemical studies of circadian rhythmicity in Neurospora is now possible...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} in this laboratory (1) {{have demonstrated that}} in Neurospora crassa growth characteristics representing at least two stable states are possible with the same constitution of nuclear genes. If a slow growing strain, designated poky, functions in a cross to wild type as the “maternal” or protoperithecial parent, then all progeny from the cross exhibit the poky character. If the cross {{is made in the}} reverse, or reciprocal manner, that is, with the wild type strain functioning as a protoperithecial parent, then all progeny are normal in growth rate. During the course of the work on inheritance it was observed that <b>mycelial</b> <b>pads</b> from poky were characterized by a red color reminiscent of that of the heme pigments. Examinations of suspensions and extracts of the mold with a spectroscope yielded the information that poky mycelium contains large quantities of a substance having the absorption spectrum characteristic of cytochrome c, whereas the bands corresponding to cytochromes a and b were not visible. All three of these components were detected easily in the wild type strain. The experimental results presented here provide more precise information on the similarities and differences between these two strains with respect to the cytochrome and the succinic acid oxidase systems. Preliminary observations suggested that poliy in Neurospora is analogous to petite in yeast (2) in which abnormalities in the succinic acid oxidase system have been reported, but this analogy is shown here to be only a partial one...|$|R
