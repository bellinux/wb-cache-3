5|$|An acute nosebleed may {{be managed}} {{with a variety}} of measures, such as packing of the nasal cavity with {{absorbent}} swabs or gels. Removal of the packs after the bleeding may lead to reopening of the fragile vessels, and therefore lubricated or atraumatic packing is recommended. Some patients <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> learn packing themselves to deal with nosebleeds without having to resort to medical help.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the {{hardware}} and software behind the fountain's operation were replaced. At the time there were plans to replace LED lighting with incandescent bulbs {{on each of the}} non-video display surfaces and to replace the video surface LEDs. Plensa, who maintained control of the video faces for {{the first two years of}} the fountain's operation, understands that future generations <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> update the faces used in the rotation of videos to reflect changes in humanity going forward. In 2014, an additional 1000 faces were anticipated for 2016.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} reasons why the {{government}} <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> increase the school leaving age, considering it has raised the age numerous times over the 19th and 20th centuries, the last time being in 2015. With past age raisings, the reasons given have been focused mainly on generating more skilled labour by providing additional time for students to gain additional skills and qualifications. In recent years, {{it became apparent that}} most 16 to 18 year-olds have not been motivated to continue their education after completion of their GCSEs, thus increasing the overall unemployment rate given many are unable to find work. The British government hoped that by making education compulsory up to the age of 17 by 2013 and 18 by 2015, it could change this.|$|E

25|$|In {{some areas}} the {{commission}} <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> recommend {{a continuation of}} the existing two-tier structure.

25|$|Whether Assad stays or goes, jihadism now has {{a strong}} {{foothold}} in Syria. The Free Syrian Army <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> dismiss its al-Qaeda allies as irrelevant in order to reassure the West and continue receiving Western support, but the jihadi websites and footage of al-Qaeda fighting in Damascus and Aleppo tell a different story.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} an attacking team's set of six, the attacking team <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> kick (grubber or chip kick) {{the ball}} in to touch and give the {{opposition}} a scrum feed.

25|$|The U.S. {{government}} {{relies on}} recognized tribal organizations {{to determine their}} own membership. Consequently, individuals must apply to their American Indian and Alaska Native tribes directly to establish membership and enrollment. Applicants <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> find out in advance whether the organization accepts blood tests or DNA tests. They may also wish to contact the American Indian & Alaska Native Genetics Resource Center.|$|E
25|$|The debtor must {{deliver a}} copy of the notice to every one of his creditors. The object of this {{requirement}} is to provide further protection to creditors who <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> contest the application or take steps to safeguard their interests.

25|$|Large {{commercial}} and industrial premises may use electronic meters which record power usage in blocks of {{half an hour or}} less. This is because most electricity grids have demand surges throughout the day, and the power company <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> give price incentives to large customers to reduce demand at these times. These demand surges often correspond to meal times or, famously, to advertisements interrupting popular television programmes.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{hand washing}} and not sharing personal items. While treatment {{is not necessary}} some <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> have the lesions removed for cosmetic reasons or to prevent spread. Removal may occur with freezing, opening up the lesion and scraping the inside, or laser therapy. Scraping the lesion can however result in scarring. The medication cimetidine by mouth or podophyllotoxin cream applied to the skin may also be used.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in Crohn's disease, the {{gastrointestinal}} {{aspects of}} ulcerative colitis can generally be cured by surgical {{removal of the}} large intestine, though extraintestinal symptoms may persist.
