50|$|Process {{control and}} energy {{conservation}} {{are the two}} primary reasons for using an adjustable <b>speed</b> <b>drive.</b> Historically, adjustable <b>speed</b> <b>drives</b> were developed for process control, but energy conservation has emerged as an equally important objective.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the onset}} of automation, {{industry}} has relied on adjustable <b>speed</b> <b>drives</b> to accurately control the speed of motors. Recent advances have {{increased the number of}} adjustable <b>speed</b> <b>drives</b> hitting the market. The proper operation of the <b>speed</b> <b>drives</b> requires electrical supply with relatively high power quality which is not the case in most industrial facilities. Power quality problems such as harmonic, sag, swell, flicker, and unbalance can trip the <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> with a wrong message, which is referred as a premature tripping. Although the power quality problems can be mitigated by using custom power devices, they are bulky and costly. Moreover, they themselves might adversely affect the operation of the adjustable <b>speed</b> <b>drive.</b> A comprehensive study done in this thesis presents the overlooked effect of the custom power devices on the <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> stability. It is found that the <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> system might trip due to its interaction with custom power devices. Obviously, it is vital to increase ASD immunity to premature tripping because of poor power quality or custom power. This thesis offers fast, efficient and robust algorithms to achieve this immunity by retrofitting the ASD control unit and integrating the power conditioning function with the adjustable <b>speed</b> <b>drive.</b> Therefore, the power quality problem is mitigated and the drive system performance is significantly enhamced. Such integration requires the modification of the control unit by considering various elements such as envelope tracking, phase-locked loop, symmetrical component extraction, and the controller. Simple but robust and fast algorithms are proposed for such elements based on a newly developed energy operator algorithm. The developed energy operator and the developed algorithms overcome the drawbacks of the existing algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{provides}} an {{efficient way to}} mitigate the interharmonics appearing in the input side of the adjustable <b>speed</b> <b>drives</b> which are created by an imbalance in the motor current. The adjustable <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> consists of VSI and diode rectifier. The present work examines how unbalance in the motor current distorts the inverter dc side current and this appears as interharmonic distortion in the input currents of the AC side. C-type filter and AC choke are designed for the proposed method for mitigation of this harmonics and interharmonics. The proposed method is simulated using MATLAB / SIMULINK software.

40|$|Most motors are {{designed}} to operate at a constant speed and provide a constant output; however, modern technology requires different speeds in many applications where electric motors are used. A variable <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> (VSD) is a device that regulates the speed and rotational force, or output torque of mechanical equipment. Effects of applying VSDs are in both productivity improvements and energy savings in pumps, fans, compressors and other equipment. Variable <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> technology {{and the importance of}} controlling the speed of existing motors have fascinated many attentions in the last years with the advent of new power devices and magnetic materials. This paper is a comprehensive review on applications of VSD in electrical motors energy savings. The aim is to identify energy saving opportunities and incorporated costs of applying variable <b>speed</b> <b>drives</b> to the existing applications of electrical motors. Subsequently, economic analysis, payback period and the effect of current and voltage harmonics generated by VSDs are presented.

Therefore in the competitive markets of today where reducing costs {{is an important part}} of surviving, any methods of reducing the amount of power used in the processes that industry performs will be advantageous. With induction motors so widely used they account for a significant part of the energy requirements of many companies.

If a variable <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> compressor operates continuously at full speed, the switching losses of the frequency converter result in a lower energy efficiency than an otherwise identically sized fixed speed compressor. Where demand remains constant within 5-15% of the total free air delivery flow rate, dual-control compressors configured in a split solution can provide higher efficiency than a VFD.|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays {{centrifugal}} pumps are being {{widely used in}} the commercial, industrial and power plant applications and most of pumps operated by constant <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> system. Therefore, pump consumes a huge energy of each nation's total energy. But it could be operated in variable <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> system which would be provided energy saving. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the pump performance characteristics of the multistage centrifugal pump with the variable drive system. For this study an experimental set up of the system was constructed to achieve the centrifugal pump performances such as H-Q, η-Q, P-Q curves and operating points which interact between performance and system curves. In the variable <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> system, a vector controlled inverter driving (variable voltage variable frequency) was installed in the experimental system. A numerical investigation also applied for getting the pump performances for the validation and reliability of the pump design development and also the pressure and velocity effects in internal flows of the pump are analyzed. For the numerical analysis, the Navier-Stokes equations were discretized by the finite volume method and two equations transport turbulence (SST) model accounts for three dimensional steady flows. In the experiment system, we also carried out system head performance of the three pumps in parallel to compare with one pump system head for its validation. In order to get the energy saving rate using the inverter control variable <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> system instead of the constant <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> system, it is necessary to identify the specific duty cycle of the pump operation cycle and operating system curve of the pump. Hopefully, this paper will be useful as a guide for identifying a method of implementing a variable <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> system with inverter control in the variable flow and pressure system...|$|R

40|$|Fan {{systems are}} {{responsible}} for approximately 10 % of the electricity consumption in industrial and municipal sectors, {{and it has been}} found that there is energy-saving potential in these systems. To this end, variable <b>speed</b> <b>drives</b> (VSDs) are used to enhance the efficiency of fan systems. Usually, fan system operation is optimized based on measurements of the system, but there are seldom readily installed meters in the system {{that can be used for}} the purpose. Thus, sensorless methods are needed for the optimization of fan system operation. In this thesis, methods for the fan operating point estimation with a variable <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> are studied and discussed. These methods can be used for the energy efficient control of the fan system without additional measurements. The operation of these methods is validated by laboratory measurements and data from an industrial fan system. In addition to their energy consumption, condition monitoring of fan systems is a key issue as fans are an integral part of various production processes. Fan system condition monitoring is usually carried out with vibration measurements, which again increase the system complexity. However, variable <b>speed</b> <b>drives</b> can already be used for pumping system condition monitoring. Therefore, it would add to the usability of a variablespeed- driven fan system if the variable <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> could be used as a condition monitoring device. In this thesis, sensorless detection methods for three lifetime-reducing phenomena are suggested: these are detection of the fan contamination build-up, the correct rotational direction, and the fan surge. The methods use the variable <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> monitoring and control options for the detection along with simple signal processing methods, such as power spectrum density estimates. The methods have been validated by laboratory measurements. The key finding of this doctoral thesis is that a variable <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> can be used on its own as a monitoring and control device for the fan system energy efficiency, and it can also be used in the detection of certain lifetime-reducing phenomena...|$|R
