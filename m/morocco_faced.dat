50|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} Morocco largely had kept Polisario troops off by {{building}} a huge berm or sand wall (the Moroccan Wall). The Moroccan army stationed a number of troops roughly {{the same size as}} the entire Sahrawi population to defend the wall, enclosing the Southern Provinces, the economically useful parts of Western Sahara (Bou Craa, El-Aaiun, Smara etc.). This stalemated the war, with no side able to achieve decisive gains, but artillery strikes and sniping attacks by the guerrillas continued, and Morocco was economically and politically strained by the war. <b>Morocco</b> <b>faced</b> heavy burdens due to the economic costs of its massive troop deployments along the Wall.

30|$|Of course, the US in 1890 and Morocco in 2008 {{operated}} {{in a very}} different global context. The US, for example, did not face in 1890 the same level of competition from other countries compared with what <b>Morocco</b> <b>faces</b> today from countries such as India and China. In addition, global trade was not as developed in 1890 as it is today. But the level of economic development in terms of a transition from an agrarian to an industrialized society remains as much of a distinctive feature of an economy today as it was 120 years ago. The global context has changed, but some essential elements of the process of economic development remain true. As described in section two of this paper, this is a distinctive assumption of the literature that relates economic development to FPR.|$|R

50|$|<b>Morocco</b> <b>faces</b> {{multiple}} {{public health}} burdens: infectious diseases, high maternal mortality rates, a growing incidence of noncommunicable diseases, and risks posed by environmental toxins. Inadequate laboratories and surveillance {{as well as}} a lack of technical and research expertise hinder evidence-based decision making. Based on input from IANPHI-funded workshops and public health experts from the U.S. and Norway, Morocco’s National Institute of Hygiene is exploring creation of a new NPHI that would monitor, assess, and respond to health threats. Envisioned is an institute responsible for environmental health, non-communicable diseases, poison control, pharmacovigilence, maternal child health, and research. The NPHI would coordinate public health functions, enhance technical expertise (including new laboratories and training), and strengthen surveillance and health information. Pilot surveillance projects under consideration include assessments of environmental hazards, maternal mortality, and tobacco and other NCD health risks. Morocco also is exploring several partnerships: a twinning program to help build applied research capacity, laboratory design by architecture firm Perkins+Will, and creation of an FELTP by the CDC.|$|R
5000|$|French {{encroachment}} on Morocco {{began in}} 1907, {{with the military}} occupation of the towns of Casablanca and Oujda, following the assassination of some French nationals in Moroccan cities during disorders marked by xenophobic violence. The French military presence outraged domestic opinion in Morocco, but the new Alawite sultan Abd al-Hafid of <b>Morocco,</b> <b>facing</b> severe financial difficulties and dependent on French loans, was unable to do much about it. Some tribal leaders took {{matters into their own}} hands and attacked the French themselves. Notable among these was the Saharan marabout Ma al-'Aynayn, who had previously led the anti-French resistance in Mauritania. In 1910, al-Aynayn crossed the High Atlas with his veiled, camel-riding Saharan troops (nicknamed the [...] "Blue Men"), aiming to liberate Casablanca, but he was defeated by the French at Tadla on 23 June 1910, and forced to retreat to Tiznit (in the Anti-Atlas foothills of the Souss valley), where he died shortly after.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze trade potential versus actual realized trade among North African trading partners. Following the literature on production economics, we built a stochastic frontier gravity model. The underlying assumption is that all deviations from trade potential is not due to white noise but may also be due to inefficiencies. Time-variant country-specific trade efficiency estimates are obtained and analyzed. Our results indicate that Mauritania, as a country both of destination and of origin, is where the region’s trading relationship is the least efficient. Tunisia, followed by <b>Morocco,</b> <b>faces</b> the fewest behind- and beyond-the-border effects. Our analysis of market integration and trade efficiency at the disaggregated level indicates that trade efficiency scores exhibit high variability between categories of products. Moreover, North African market integration is worst when considering the goods from “Textiles; Footwear & Headgear” category. Our estimates indicate that trade efficiency for agricultural products is relatively low, indicating the existence of significant behind- and beyond-the-border inefficiencies. Our estimates also underline the importance of improving domestic policies to encourage entrepreneurial development and business facilities. Working paperNon-PRIFPRI 1; AGRODEPMTI...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{tremendous}} energy challenges <b>Morocco</b> <b>faces,</b> {{and its potential}} role as an exporter of green electricity to Eu-rope, {{the country has been}} particularly targeted by Germany’s efforts to promote the uptake of renewable energies abroad. This paper explores whether ideas and policies in the field of renewable energy effectively traveled through transfer channels established between Germany and Morocco. In particular, the question of how Morocco’s policy ob-jectives shaped the result of transfer processes is discussed, shedding light on a currently under-researched determi-nant for policy transfer. Drawing upon forty-five semi-structured interviews with Moroccan, German, and international stakeholders, as well as card-ranking exercises, the article provides first-hand insights into the dynamics and drivers of Morocco’s “energy transition”. Findings presented in the article show that differing policy objectives did not preclude the transfer of ideas between Germany and Morocco, but shaped its outcome with regard to policy instrument selection. While basic policy orientations in favour of renewable energies were facilitated by transferred knowledge, a perceived in-compatibility between domestic policy objectives and the policy instruments used in the foreign model led to selective les-son-drawing from the German example. This finding underlines the importance for “senders ” who wish to actively pro...|$|R

Results: Phylogenetic and molecular markers analyses showed the Moroccan viruses belonged to the G 1 lineage and likely originated from the Middle East. As known for H 9 N 2 viruses, the Moroccanisolates possess several genetic markers that enhance virulence in poultry and transmission to humans. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that under field conditions H 9 N 2 could have a devastating effect on egg production and mortalities and highlighted a lack of surveillance data on the pathogen in the region...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the last}} few years <b>Morocco</b> has <b>faced</b> a {{continuous}} series of dry seasons, which has put a great stress on its limited water resources. Hence, for some time now Morocco has been considering desalinating seawater to supply fresh water to some areas. In the early 1980 ’s, due to limited energy resources, Morocco was obliged to consider other alternatives to meet its energy demands. A feasibility study for the introduction of a nuclear power plant into the national electrical grid was launched. Even though the study showed that the commercially proven, large size reactors could not be integrated into the grid due to their limited capacity, the national electrical utility continues to pursue its efforts to introduce nuclear energy into the country. Presently, the feasibility study is being updated and a bid invitation specification is being prepared {{with the help of the}} IAEA experts. In response to the increasing need for energy and water, Morocco and some North African countries participated in the IAEA regional project on the feasibility study on using nuclear energy for seawater desalination...|$|R
