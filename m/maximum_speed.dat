5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> would have been about , {{which is about the}} speed of a human sprinter. But he also noted that such estimates depend on many dubious assumptions.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} off-season, Kings Dominion widened the first high-speed turn {{to lower the}} amount of G-force experienced on the ride.

40|$|The known {{relationships}} of speed, gait and body size (derived mainly from mammals) {{are used to}} determine the gaits and theoretical <b>maximum</b> <b>speeds</b> of dinosaurs. Speed estimates are made for 62 dinosaurs (representing 51 genera) and are supplemented with information from comparative anatomy and from dinosaur trackways. It is concluded that smaller bipedal dinosaurs were capable of running at speeds up to 35 or 40 km/h. The so-called "ostrich dinosaurs" are credited with <b>maximum</b> <b>speeds</b> less than 60 km/h, and possibly as low as 35 or 40 km/h. Larger bipedal dinosaurs were probably restricted to walking or slow trotting gaits, with <b>maximum</b> <b>speeds</b> in the range 15 - 20 km/h. Most quadrupedal dinosaurs seem to have been restricted to a walking gait. Stegosaurs and ankylosaurs may have had <b>maximum</b> <b>speeds</b> as low as 6 - 8 km/h. Sauropods may have attained 12 - 17 km/h, and some ceratopsians may have been capable of trotting at speeds up to 25 km/h. On a weight-for-weight basis the speeds of dinosaurs are generally lower than those of mammals...|$|R

5|$|In January 1982, the U.S. Air Force awarded two {{contracts}} to Rockwell worth a combined $2.2 {{billion for the}} development and production of 100 new B-1 bombers. Numerous changes {{were made to the}} design to make it better suited to the now expected missions, resulting in the new B-1B. These changes included a reduction in <b>maximum</b> <b>speed,</b> which allowed the variable-aspect intake ramps to be replaced by simpler fixed geometry intake ramps in the newer design. This reduced the B-1B's radar signature or radar cross-section; this reduction was seen as a good trade off for the speed decrease. High subsonic speeds at low altitude became a focus area for the revised design, and low-level speeds were increased from about Mach0.85 to 0.92. The B-1B has a <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of Mach1.25 at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed D-21 was an American {{reconnaissance}} drone with <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> {{in excess}} of Mach3.3 (2,215mph; 3,564km/h). The D-21 was initially designed to be launched {{from the back of}} a M-21 carrier aircraft, a variant of the Lockheed A-12 aircraft. Development began in October 1962. Originally known by the Lockheed designation Q-12, the drone was intended for reconnaissance deep in enemy airspace.|$|E

30|$|As can be seen, the speeds {{ranging from}} 200 to 320  km/h {{coincide}} {{with each other}} for many HS trains. Nevertheless, generally, with the increase of the <b>maximum</b> design <b>speed,</b> the positive difference between this and the <b>maximum</b> operating <b>speed</b> tends to increase. This particularly happens for the speeds ranging between 270 and 380  km/h. Consequently, at particularly high <b>maximum</b> design <b>speeds</b> (above 300  km/h), it is likely to expect the lower <b>maximum</b> operating <b>speeds</b> for about 10  %– 20  %, as shown in this case.|$|R

5|$|The US Navy {{continued}} {{to expand its}} battlefleet, laying down two ships in most subsequent years until 1920. The US {{continued to}} use reciprocating engines {{as an alternative to}} turbines until the , laid down in 1912. In part, this reflected a cautious approach to battleship-building, and in part a preference for long endurance over high <b>maximum</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Turbines {{also had}} disadvantages. At {{cruising}} speeds much slower than <b>maximum</b> <b>speed,</b> turbines were markedly less fuel-efficient than reciprocating engines. This was {{particularly important for}} navies which required a long range at cruising speeds—and hence for the US Navy, which was planning {{in the event of}} war to cruise across the Pacific and engage the Japanese in the Philippines.|$|E
30|$|Another {{source of}} {{information}} to assist with the classification is the speed profile itself: the <b>maximum</b> <b>speeds</b> within a given profile can be compared against a database of <b>maximum</b> line <b>speeds</b> for routes within a network to help determine location. This can be extended to compare the line speed profile against the measured speed profile throughout the journey.|$|R

5|$|Enzyme rates {{depend on}} {{solution}} conditions and substrate concentration. To find the <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This {{is shown in}} the saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, {{more and more of the}} free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.|$|E

Kondo also brought his own Advanced force forward at <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> so that Junyōs aircraft could join in {{the attacks on the}} U.S. ships. At 08:10, Shōkaku launched a second wave of strike aircraft, consisting of 19 dive bombers and eight Zeros, and Zuikaku launched 16 torpedo bombers at 08:40. Thus, by 09:10 the Japanese had 110 aircraft on the way to attack the U.S. carriers.|$|E
5|$|Polikarpov began {{preliminary}} design of two updated {{versions of the}} I-185 design in February 1943. The I-187 had a M-71F engine of 1,640kW (2,200hp), a bubble canopy, four 20mm cannons, eight RS-82 rockets and an estimated <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of 710km/h (441mph). The I-188 used an improved M-90 engine with 1,552kW (2,080hp) and used the same armament as the I-187, although the fuselage was slimmer {{than that of the}} I-187 because of the slimmer engine.|$|E

The first prototype of the revised version, the Do 17M V1 (D-ABVD) was powered by two DB 600s, and demonstrated impressive performance, including a <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of 425km/h (264mph).|$|E
5|$|The Nino Bixio {{class was}} a pair of {{protected}} cruisers built for the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in the 1910s. The two ships, , and , were built in Castellammare between 1911 and 1914. They were intended to serve as scouts for the main Italian fleet, and as such required a high top speed. They were overweight as built, which prevented them from reaching their intended <b>maximum</b> <b>speed.</b> They were a disappointment in service, especially compared to the earlierand fastercruiser , which cut their careers short.|$|E
5|$|The {{athletics}} {{competition at}} the first Olympics featured a men's long jump competition and a women's competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride {{to allow them to}} take off near the board while still maintaining their <b>maximum</b> <b>speed.</b> In addition to the traditional long jump, a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run-up. A men's version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912.|$|E
