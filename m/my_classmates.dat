500|$|Speaking {{about his}} childhood, Khan {{said that he}} was exposed to a [...] "life beyond movies", and his mother {{described}} him as someone who was [...] "not an easy child [...] He was impulsive [...] spontaneous." [...] As a child, he recalls fond memories of watching his father playing cricket in the garden, and has emphasised his father's education and background as having a lasting impression on how family life was conducted. Khan studied at The Lawrence School, Sanawar in Himachal Pradesh and was later sent to Lockers Park School in Hertfordshire at the age of nine. He next enrolled at Winchester College and explained that [...] "I did not take advantage of my tenure [...] <b>My</b> <b>classmates</b> went on to Oxford and Cambridge, but I was not academically inclined.

[...] Michael Cragg for The Guardian compared the chanting chorus to that of Justice vs. Simian's track, [...] "We Are Your Friends". He called it both [...] "ridiculously cool and a bit naff". In response to the general acclaim from critics, Roberts wished that the track would be well received amongst her peers, saying [...] "I haven't seen one bad review from the single or album samplers – it seems {{too good to be}} true. The response from critics has been amazing. It's like being at school and being told ‘well done’ by the teachers but I want <b>my</b> <b>classmates</b> to like it too. I want the people at home to get something from the record. Then I'll be doubly happy." ...|$|E

500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something <b>my</b> <b>classmates</b> couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E

[...] "I remember that {{at least a third}} of <b>my</b> <b>classmates</b> at elementary school in Wadowice were Jews. At elementary school there were fewer. With some I was on very friendly terms. And what struck me about some of them was their Polish patriotism." [...] It was around this time that the young Karol had his first serious relationship with a girl.

Each time I was unceremoniously marched out of class, in front of the instructor and all <b>my</b> <b>classmates,</b> by a uniformed policeman. Once this occurred during a final exam in accounting. [...] …At each interrogation, I refused to tell them anything. [...] Each time I was amazed that, while I was truly terrified by their tactics and their threats, I was able to stonewall their questions and refuse to give them the answers they were so desperate for. I came to realize that they, as a group, were really a very dumb bunch of redneck, illiterate people, clumsily wielding a vast amount of power over others.|$|E

[...] That was my senior year and I was a ‘new boy’, having just moved to Massillon that summer from the wide open spaces of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. [...] The first day at school several of <b>my</b> <b>classmates</b> came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but I do remember distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games. [...] I can’t remember who we beat, but I do recall, painfully even after this lapse of time, that our friends over at the county seat (Canton, Ohio) took us to the cleaners twice.” ...|$|E

60|$|Having left my {{home for}} the purpose of {{securing}} experience in the world, I had this satisfaction--I was getting it! Very sweet and far away seemed all that beautiful life with Alice and Burton and Hattie at the Seminary, something to dream over, to regret, to versify, something which the future (at this moment) seemed utterly incapable of reproducing. I still corresponded with several of <b>my</b> <b>classmates,</b> but was careful to conceal the struggle that I was undergoing. I told them only of my travels and my reading.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{only fair}} to say that I had risen by this time to the dignity of [...] "boughten shirts," [...] linen collars and [...] "Congress gaiters," [...] and my suit {{purchased}} for graduating purposes was of black diagonal with a long tail, a garment which fitted me reasonably well. It was hot, of course, and nearly parboiled me of a summer evening, but I bore my suffering like the hero that I was, in order that I might make a presentable figure in the eyes of <b>my</b> <b>classmates.</b> I longed for a white vest but did not attain to that splendor.|$|E
60|$|However, I had pondered {{upon this}} scene {{so long and}} had figured my course so exactly that I made all the turns with {{moderate}} degree of grace and succeeded finally in facing my audience without falling up the steps (as several others had done) and so looked down upon my fellows like Tennyson's eagle on the sea. In that instant a singular calm fell over me, I became strangely master of myself. From somewhere above me a new and amazing power fell upon me and in that instant I perceived {{on the faces of}} <b>my</b> <b>classmates</b> a certain expression of surprise and serious respect. My subconscious oratorical self had taken charge.|$|E

60|$|That night, at the Seminary, I met the Alumni {{and spoke}} to them on some subject {{connected}} with {{the early history of}} the school, and in doing so I obtained once again a perception of the barrier which had risen between <b>my</b> <b>classmates</b> and myself. They were not only serious, they were piteously solemn. No one laughed, no one took a light and airy view of life. Once or twice I tried to jest or ventured a humorous remark, but these attempts to lighten the gloom were met with chilling silence. No one whispered or smiled or turned aside. It was like a prayer meeting in the face of famine.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless I came safely away, a neater, {{older and}} graver person, {{walking with a}} manlier stride, and when I confronted <b>my</b> <b>classmates</b> at the Grove school-house on Sunday, I gave {{evidence}} of an accession of self-confidence. The fact that my back hair was now in fashionable order was of greatest comfort to me. If only my trousers had not continued their distressing habit of climbing up my boot-tops I would have been almost at ease but every time I rose from my seat it became necessary to make each instep smooth the leg of the other pantaloon, and even then they kept their shameful wrinkles, and a knowledge of my exposed ankles humbled me.|$|E

Lee Moss, one of <b>my</b> <b>classmates,</b> and in those Seminary days a rival orator, was in my audience, and so was Burton, wordless as ever, and a little sad, for his attempt at preaching had not been successful--his ineradicable shyness had been against him. Hattie was there looking thin and old, and Ella and Matilda with others of the girls I had known eight years before. Some were accompanied by their children.|$|E
