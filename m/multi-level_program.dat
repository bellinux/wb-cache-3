In order to make the comparison of those strategies possible, we show the complexities in terms of memory requirement and execution time.

This paper recalls these rules, but also summarises the different possible strategies for the differentiation of a <b>multi-level</b> <b>program</b> in reverse mode. We focus on the reverse mode, because the computation of derivatives in reverse order (w. r. t. the computation of original variables) makes the problem much more complicated. A lot of strategies {{can be applied to}} generate an adjoint code: these strategies are applied within hand-coded discrete adjoints or within automatically generated adjoints. But they are not necessarily known by both communities, this is why we describe several of them in this paper. Until now, the comparison of these strategies on a code is difficult because no complexity measure has been associated to them. This paper presents complexity measures of the adjoint codes generated using these strategies in terms of execution time and memory requirement. These complexities are based on some elementary measures such as execution time and memory requirement of their sub-programs. For sake of simplicity, in a first phase we neglect the memory management within time costs. In a second phase, we explain how the extra cost first neglected can be accommodated for in the complexity measures...|$|E

The architectural diversity of platform components makes tapping into the platform potential a challenging programming task. This thesis makes an important step in this direction by introducing a novel methodology for automatic generation of structured, <b>multi-level</b> parallel <b>programs</b> from sequential applications. We introduce a novel hierarchical intermediate program representation (HiPRDG) that captures the notions of structure and hierarchy in the polyhedral model used for compile-time program transformation and code generation. Using the HiPRDG as the starting point, we present a novel method for generation of <b>multi-level</b> <b>programs</b> (MLPs) featuring diﬀerent types of parallelism, such as task, data, and pipeline parallelism. Moreover, we introduce concepts and techniques for data parallelism identification, GPU code generation, and asynchronous data-driven execution on heterogeneous platforms with efficient overlapping of host-accelerator communication and computation. By enabling the modular, hybrid parallelization of program model components via HiPRDG, this thesis opens the door for highly eﬃcient tailor-made parallel program generation and auto-tuning for next generations of multi-level heterogeneous platforms with diverse accelerators.

30|$|<b>Multi-level</b> <b>programming</b> problem {{deals with}} an {{optimization}} problem with multiple decision makers who are organized in hierarchical levels. In this setting, {{at least one}} decision maker is located {{at each of the}} hierarchical decision making levels and each controls an independent decision vector for optimizing his/her own objective. In hierarchical (or multi-level) optimization, the constraint domain at each of the upper levels is implicitly determined by a series of optimization problems which must be solved in a predetermined sequence. In the real world, we often encounter situations where there are two or more decision makers in an organization with a hierarchical structure, and they make decisions in turn or at the same time so as to optimize their objective functions (Abo-Sinna and Baky 2006; Azad et al. 2006; Bialas and Karwan 1984; Sakawa et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|Using {{an inverse}} {{function}} transformation approach, Mishra and Ghosh (2006) proposed an interactive method to solve quadratic fractional bi-level problems. However, {{this method is}} computationally demanding as it involves additional steps at each iterations. Moreover, Lachhwani and Poonia (2012) proposed fuzzy goal <b>programming</b> approach for <b>multi-level</b> linear fractional <b>programming</b> problem by constructing a tolerance membership functions for the fuzzily described numerator and denominator part of the objective functions of all levels. To apply this method, decision makers need to change their tolerance value at each iterative step and this might cause a delay in arriving at a satisfactory solution, especially for large problems. Modifying this algorithm, Lachhwani and Nehra (2015) {{came up with an}} algorithm (and its MATLAB implementation) that can possibly solve linear fractional <b>multi-level</b> <b>programming</b> problems. In some other literature (such as Biswas and Bose 2011; Dalman 2016; Emam et al. 2015) a linearization technique, which is proposed in Ignizio (1976), is employed to transform the fractional membership functions to an approximate linear function one. Since this transformation contains only local behavior of the functions, {{there is a possibility that}} the algorithm may produce non-satisfactory solutions for the system.|$|R
40|$|This {{coordination}} of decision authority is noteworthy {{especially in a}} complex multi-level structured organization, which faces multi-objective problems to achieve overall organization targets.

Yet, it is realized that sometimes estimating the coefficients of objective functions in the multi-objective model are difficult when the statistical data contain random and fuzzy information. Hence, this paper proposes a fuzzy goal programming additive model, to solve a multi-level multi-objective problem in a fuzzy environment, which can attain a satisfaction solution. A numerical example of production planning problem illustrates the solution.
