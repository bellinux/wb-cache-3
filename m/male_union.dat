5000|$|In response, U.S. tobacco {{companies}} producing low-priced (5-cent) cigars continued {{the practice of}} hiring and training female cigar workers in preference to men, believing that women [...] "don't drink" [...] and were more reliable, more careful in their work, and more easily managed. The exclusionary attitudes of <b>male</b> <b>union</b> members to females joining the unions meant that most female workers were not union members. [...] Additionally, {{the vast majority of}} female cigar workers did not smoke cigars, thus saving manufacturers the customary three free cigars per day given to male cigar rollers for their personal consumption. However, the preference for women workers did not solve the problem of increasing labor and tobacco costs, and a {{rise in the number of}} strikes by female employees in the low-priced cigar industry after 1910 meant that factory owners could no longer count on the docility of women workers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The trade-displacement {{relationship}} is examined using observations from the 1984 - 2000 Displaced Worker Surveys and corresponding industry data. Increases in import penetration and decreases in import prices correlate with higher displacement rates. Considerable {{variation in the}} effects of import competition on displacement probabilities is found across worker types. For example, the estimated displacement probability for a minority female {{who is not a}} union member but who has completed some college coursework ranges from 6. 44 to 7. 13 percent. This is significantly higher than the range estimated (1. 02 to 1. 24 percent) for college-educated, white, <b>male</b> <b>union</b> members. Setting import competition values equal to zero, we see estimated displacement probabilities for such workers decrease by 0. 05 to 0. 07 percentage points. Non-union, minority female workers with some college education realize reductions of 0. 40 to 2. 56 percentage points in their probabilities. Thus, workers most at risk of displacement are also most affected by import competition...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explains}} {{the structure of}} the temporary or irregular form of employment in South Korea. In Korea, the size of the irregular workers as a percentage of labor force increased from 43. 4 % to 52. 7 % from 1996 to 2005. Both the sheer absolute size and the rapid rate of growth are evidence for the dominance of this form of employment in Korea. However, irregular workers are generally kept deprived of health insurance, unemployment insurance, overtime payments, retirement allowances, and any kind of bonuses. Largely, irregular Korean workers are subject to job insecurity and meager pay rates. While there is the institution of a social security system in place for the irregular workers in Korea, due to the lenient law enforcement of social security obligations, firms find it cost effective to evade giving these benefits and hence employ more and more from the irregular segment of the labor force. Almost 70 % of all irregular workers are females who are employed as part-timers, on-call workers, and day laborers, through temporary agencies, subcontracting companies, and independent contractors. Over time, the powerful dominant enterprises have successfully managed to maintain low wage payments to irregular female workers relative to male workers. Persistence of the wage differentials between male and female irregular workers highlights the cost advantage of hiring female workers and the temporal exit of more male workers from the irregular labor force. There are institutions of labor unions for workers in Korea which are significantly represented by the male workers. The female union membership went down from 36. 7 % in 1980 to 21. 1 % in 2003 whereas that of the <b>male</b> <b>union</b> members increased from 63. 3 % to 78. 9 % in the same period. The lenient laws and cursory light enforcement of regulations by the government and gender discrimination in the trade unions have {{led to the development of}} non-governmental organizations (NGOs) of women worker activists undertaking the lead role in support of irregular worker movements such as the Korean Women Workers’ Association United (KWWAU). However, in South Korea, there are large, conglomerate family-controlled firms with strong ties to the government known as the “chaebol”. The chaebol have an important role in controlling the irregular labor force. The supportive policies regarding the employment of the irregular workers are for the most parts weaved around the interests and benefits of the chaebols. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Soc. Sc. (International Relations) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2014 South Africa is a {{beautiful}} country that is made up by different tribes, clans and races. It is truly a rainbow nation that had struggled enormously against minority rule {{and it was only}} in 1994 that the first democratic election took place. Women were a force to reckon with during the fight against apartheid and during the political negotiations that took place prior to the first democratic election. Their involvement in the negotiations led to policies and frameworks that were meant to ensure gender equality and the promotion of the rights of all women in South Africa irrespective of race and creed. Women, especially black women, had suffered a great deal during apartheid as they {{had to deal with the}} constraints placed against them by the minority regime. They also had to deal with constraints placed against them by by-products of patriarchy at home and in the society. As a result of this women wanted to ensure that the new dispensation was sensitive and aware of their needs. They wanted the new government to ensure gender equality. They stealthily fought for recognition and the right to be heard during the negotiations. Patriarchy played its hand during these negotiations as many <b>male</b> <b>union</b> members held the view that women need not be involved in these negotiations, let alone call for an addition of terms to the negotiations. Despite this, women persevered and gender sensitive policies and laws were crafted. Under the new government South Africa has gained a reputation as a country that is committed to the promotion of gender equality. Its domestic laws and foreign policy show that it is intent on safeguarding gender equality and has a great disdain to any country, person or entity that violates women. It has established proactive national gender frameworks, allows fair discrimination as a way of advancing women, and has equality courts as well as sexual offences courts. However, despite this, South Africa is having grave difficulties in attaining a gender balanced society and furthermore she is besieged by high levels of gender based violence. Women are still exposed to human rights violations and inequalities. This study argues that the reason why South Africa is faced with these grave challenges is because it is a patriarchal society that is divided along gender lines. There is an emphasis on the difference between masculinity and femininity. Men are still seen as the dominant and women as inferior. Patriarchy is a permanent force in South Africa. It is a cause of grave concern as in most cases it hinders the implementation of policies and acts. It also hinders the carrying out of court orders such as the eviction and protection orders. The majority of women, as compared to men, are relegated to low income employment. They are also expected to perform domestic chores and the rearing of their children. Violence against women in South Africa is immense and this is despite the availability of laws and machineries that are meant to protect women. This study argues that patriarchy is the main catalyst of this problem. It breeds and legitimizes all violations and discrimination against women. It teaches male South Africans what it means to be a real man, how a real man is expected to act, what privileges are in store when they act like real men and punishments for any person especially women who contravene these expectations. It also teaches South African women what it means to be real women how a real woman is expected to act, what privileges are in store when they act like real women and punishments for contravening these expectations. Due to this fact gender inequality is difficult to eradicate and is still a problem nineteen years after gaining freedom. Master...|$|E
40|$|Trade union {{membership}} declined in 2002, but {{the importance of}} women will continue to grow, according to Carla Lipsig-Mumm©, Jennifer Curtin and Ingrid Nielsen IN THE midst {{of the war in}} Iraq, the Australian Bureau of Statistics announced news from another battle on Monday: the annual statistics on trade {{union membership}}. The bad news is that after two years of modest {{increase in the number of}} union members, membership declined in 2002. A roller-coaster pattern seems to be emerging. In 1988, union density (trade union members as a proportion of all employees) was 41. 6 per cent. The nadir came in 1997 - 99, when density dropped from 30. 3 per cent to 25. 7 per cent. From then on, although density has been slowly in decline, a modest rise in membership numbers is apparent. In 2002, however, recovery seemingly came to a halt: membership shrank by 69, 000, and density dropped from 24. 5 per cent to 23. 1 per cent. Is Australia unique in this? Throughout the developed world, trade union density has been dropping for at least a decade, but Australian decline has been abrupt and radical in comparison with the European Union, Canada, and even the United States, where the creative hostility of employers and legislation is notorious. Behind the Australian statistics, however, is a quieter story: women’s trade union membership, which had appeared pivotal in slowing the decline in union membership, has once again dropped. Since 1992, women’s trade union membership has declined at a slower rate than their male counterparts. Women’s unionisation rates are now only 3 per cent behind those of men, compared to an 8. 6 per cent difference in 1992. And women represent 43 per cent of total union membership. In part-time jobs, which are being created faster than full-time jobs, the unionisation rates of women were on the rise until 2001, with only a modest drop (0. 5 per cent) in 2002. The number of women trade union members is now higher than the number of <b>male</b> <b>union</b> members in the public sector, where the overall unionisation rate is 46. 5 per cent. But the picture is uneven. Seven out of ten Australian jobs are now in the fast-growing service sector. This sector is Jekyll/Hyde in its make-up, including the best and the worst of jobs, where security and wages are concerned. Within this sector, from 1998 to 2001 the number of women trade unionists in the accommodation and restaurant industries rose by 32 per cent, only to fall back this year. In the personal services, the pattern is volatile: 1998 - 99 saw a 20 per cent increase; 1999 - 2000, a decline of 22 per cent; 2000 - 2001, an increase of 50 per cent; 2001 - 2002, a 33 per cent decline. But women remain the anchor and pivot of future union strength, for two reasons. First, there has been a feminisation of Australian employment patterns, in sectors and employment tenure. Women are clustered in service industries, and in part-time and casual employment. These are the fastest growing sectors of the economy, and women are its heartland. Second, women’s union membership has proven more resistant to free fall than has men’s, partly because of the sector and type of their employment, but perhaps also because of changes in the culture of trade unionism. The union movement’s experimentation with new forms of recruitment, the flexibility and creativity that potential members see in the union they encounter, is a far cry from the image and reality of unionism in the Accord years and earlier. If this is not a feminisation of the culture of trade unionism, it is certainly more hospitable. Perhaps more alarming for union strategists are projections about how many new members will have to be organised in order to maintain current union density over the next five years. Based upon Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force projections and assuming a 6 per cent unemployment rate, the total number of employed persons is expected to increase to approximately 9, 700, 000 by 2007. This means that more than 405, 000 new members will need to be organised in the next five years in order to maintain overall union density at 23. 1 per cent - more than 81, 000 per year. For male employees, membership will need to increase by approximately 54, 000 per year over the next five years to maintain the current density rate of 24. 5 per cent; while for female employees, membership will need to increase by approximately 28, 000 per year over the next five years to maintain the current density rate of 21. 5 per cent. Of course these projections do not take account of the need to maintain the existing membership base. Thus, both recruitment and retention remain important for the long term viability of the trade union movement in Australia, and the challenge is considerable.

40|$|Adequate {{sleep is}} {{paramount}} to athlete recovery and performance, however little is {{know about the}} typical sleep patterns of professional rugby union players during home based training and match-play in the competitive season. AIM: The aim {{of the present study}} was to monitor changes in sleep quantity and efficiency of elite <b>male</b> rugby <b>union</b> players over a twelve night period, which included training and two competitive matches. METHODS: A total of ten elite <b>male</b> rugby <b>union</b> players from a selected team, participated in the study. Athletes sleep quantity and efficiency was monitored over a twelve night period using the Bodymedia sensewear units (BSU). RESULTS: There was a significant difference in sleep quantity (p < 0. 05) on game nights compared to non game night, with players sleeping less on game nights. Time to sleep on game nights was also significantly (p < 0. 05) later than non game nights. There was no significant difference in sleep efficiency or time at wake over the twelve night period. Sleep efficiency is defined as a percentage score calculated by incorporating movement and physiological measures over the sleep duration as determined by the BSU. Also there was no significant difference between sleep parameters on the game nights. The findings show players have significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced sleep following a home game, which is of concern considering the established negative influence of sleep deprivation on cognitive and physical performance. CONCLUSION: This data may assist coaching, medical and performance staff to develop and implement team and individualised sleep monitoring regimes to optimise training and on-field performance...|$|R
