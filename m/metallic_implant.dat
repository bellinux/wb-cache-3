5000|$|T1ρ (T1rho): Molecules have a {{kinetic energy}} {{that is a}} {{function}} of the temperature and is expressed as translational and rotational motions, and by collisions between molecules. The moving dipoles disturb the magnetic field but are often extremely rapid so that the average effect over a long time-scale may be zero. However, depending on the time-scale, the interactions between the dipoles do not always average away. At the slowest extreme the interaction time is effectively infinite and occurs where there are large, stationary field disturbances (e.g., a <b>metallic</b> <b>implant).</b> In this case the loss of coherence is described as a [...] "static dephasing". T2* is a measure of the loss of coherence in an ensemble of spins that includes all interactions (including static dephasing). T2 is a measure of the loss of coherence that excludes static dephasing, using an RF pulse to reverse the slowest types of dipolar interaction. There is in fact a continuum of interaction time-scales in a given biological sample, and the properties of the refocusing RF pulse can be tuned to refocus more than just static dephasing. In general, the rate of decay of an ensemble of spins {{is a function of}} the interaction times and also the power of the RF pulse. This type of decay, occurring under the influence of RF, is known as T1ρ. It is similar to T2 decay but with some slower dipolar interactions refocused, as well as static interactions, hence T1ρ≥T2.|$|E

40|$|The projectional {{nature of}} {{radiogram}} limits its {{amount of information}} about the instrumented spine. MRI and CT imaging can be more helpful, using cross-sectional view. However, the presence of metal-related artifacts at both conventional CT and MRI imaging can obscure relevant anatomy and disease. We reviewed the literature about overcoming artifacts from <b>metallic</b> orthopaedic <b>implants</b> at high-field strength MRI imaging and multi-detector CT. The evolution of multichannel CT has made available new techniques that can help minimizing the severe beam-hardening artifacts. The presence of artifacts at CT from metal hardware is related to image reconstruction algorithm (filter), tube current (in mA), X-ray kilovolt peak, pitch, hardware composition, geometry (shape), and location. MRI imaging has been used safely in patients with orthopaedic <b>metallic</b> <b>implants</b> because most of these implants do not have ferromagnetic properties and have been fixed into position. However, on MRI imaging <b>metallic</b> <b>implants</b> may produce geometric distortion, the so-called susceptibility artifact. In conclusion, although 140  kV and high milliamperage second exposures are recommended for imaging patients with hardware, caution should always be exercised, particularly in children, young adults, and patients undergoing multiple examinations.

This work presents an in vivo study of <b>metallic</b> <b>implant</b> corrosion to measure metallic element accumulation in organs located far from the implant, such as kidneys, livers, lungs and spleens. The studied <b>metallic</b> <b>implant</b> materials were CoCr alloy, Ti, and the experimental alloy MA 956 coated with α-alumina. The implants were inserted in the hind legs of Wistar rats.

According to the results, the highest Cr and Ti concentrations were detected in spleens. Co is mainly found in kidneys, since this element is eliminated via urine. Cr and Ti traces increased significantly in rat organs after the long implantation time. The organs of rats implanted with the α-alumina coated experimental MA 956 did not present any variation in Al content after 12 months, which means there was no degradation of the alumina layer surface. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of knee joint laxity is clinically important but its quantification remains elusive. Calibrated, low dosage fluoroscopy, combined with registered surfaces and controlled external loading may offer possible solutions for quantifying relative tibio-femoral motion without soft tissue artefact, even in native joints. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the accuracy of registration using CT and MRI derived 3 D bone models, as well as <b>metallic</b> <b>implants,</b> to 2 D single-plane fluoroscopic datasets, to assess their suitability for examining knee joint laxity. Four cadaveric knees and one knee implant were positioned using a micromanipulator. After fluoroscopy, the accuracy of registering each surface to the 2 D fluoroscopic images was determined by comparison against known translations from the micromanipulator measurements. Dynamic measurements were also performed to assess the relative tibio-femoral error. For CT and MRI derived 3 D femur and tibia models during static testing, the in-plane error was 0. 4 mm and 0. 9 mm, and out-of-plane error 2. 6 mm and 9. 3 mm respectively. For <b>metallic</b> <b>implants,</b> the in-plane error was 0. 2 mm and out-of-plane error 1. 5 mm. The relative tibio-femoral error during dynamic measurements was 0. 9 mm, 1. 2 mm and 0. 7 mm in-plane, and 3. 9 mm, 10. 4 mm and 2. 5 mm out-of-plane for CT and MRI based models and <b>metallic</b> <b>implants</b> respectively. The rotational errors ranged from 0. 5 ° to 1. 9 ° for CT, 0. 5 – 4. 3 ° for MRI and 0. 1 – 0. 8 ° for <b>metallic</b> <b>implants.</b> The results of this study indicate that single-plane fluoroscopic analysis can provide accurate information in the investigation of knee joint laxity, but should be limited to static or quasi-static evaluations when assessing native bones, where possible. With this knowledge of registration accuracy, targeted approaches for the determination of tibio-femoral laxity could now determine objective in vivo measures for the identification of ligament reconstruction candidates as well as improve our understanding of the consequences of knee joint instability in TKA...|$|R

40|$|Knee joint is an {{important}} part of human body; failure of knee joint may occur mainly because of surface to surface contact of femoral and tibial surfaces owing to the dry out of bursae fluid. The damaged surfaces must be replaced by artificial implants made of metals, ceramics, or composite materials. This process is known as total knee replacement. Three-dimensional physical model of the knee implant is modeled in NX Unigraphics 7. 5 software. This model is imported to ANSYS-WORKBENCH 13, solver used is MECHANICAL-APDL, which is based on Finite Element Method (FEM). The <b>metallic</b> <b>implant</b> is made of porous inside and dense outside. This reduces the overall weight of the implant. The failure of bearing component in knee implant is due to high stresses at the contact regions of femoral component and polyethylene insert causes wear and decreases the life of the implant. New improved knee joint implant is made, which reduces the stresses at the contact regions and increases the life of knee implant. The stiffness of artificial implants is around 110 GPa to 210 GPa, while that of the human bone is around 17 GPa.

30|$|The main {{advantage}} of bioabsorbable materials {{in contrast to}} current cage devices (titanium, PEEK, carbon) {{is the potential for}} degradation over a distinct period of time.

Lucencies have been reported around bone dowel implants in the postoperative period, which {{have been shown to}} resolve. The diagnosis of fusion through <b>metallic</b> <b>implants</b> has been difficult with both false-positive and false-negative results. The literature of imaging these implants is very sparse. Methods. Four interbody constructs were placed in cadaveric spines under different conditions and imaged using both computed tomography and plain film radiography. Results. Plain radiographs could not predict the presence of intraimplant bone whereas computed tomography was accurate. <b>Metallic</b> <b>implants</b> had a 1 – 3 -mm computed tomography artifact limiting peri-implant interpretation. Lucencies could be seen on computed tomography but not on plain radiographs. However, the opposite was also seen. Lucencies around nonmetallic implants were more visible by a 4 : 1 ratio. Conclusions. Potential errors in interpretation were identified including assessment for bridging bone, assessment for lucency, and obscuration of peri-implant detail from metallic artifact. Lucencies were more visible with nonmetallic <b>implants</b> than with <b>metallic</b> constructs.
