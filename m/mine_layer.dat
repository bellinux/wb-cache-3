25|$|In 1939, at {{the start}} of the Winter War, the ability of the Finnish Navy to lay mines was poor. Louhi was at the time the most {{efficient}} Finnish <b>mine</b> <b>layer.</b> The rest of the fleet that could be used in this function consisted of five mine boats of the T class, other surface vessels and submarines, and the civilian vessels commissioned by the Finnish Navy. Only Louhi was able to deploy large mine fields.|$|E

The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred at Inchon, days before the Battle of Incheon; the ROK ship PC-703 sank a North Korean <b>mine</b> <b>layer</b> in the Battle of Haeju Island, near Inchon. Three other supply ships were sunk by PC-703 two days later in the Yellow Sea. Thereafter, vessels from the UN nations held undisputed control of the sea about Korea. The gun ships were used in shore bombardment, while the aircraft carriers provided air support to the ground forces.|$|E

Soon afterwards, an alarm went out in Uskedal warning that three German E-boat fast attack craft were entering the Hardangerfjord. In response, district commander Orlogskaptein (Lieutenant Commander) Ulstrup – the former commander of the <b>mine</b> <b>layer</b> Tyr – gave an oral order that Sæl was to avoid contact with the superior enemy force. Ulstrup felt that the poorly armed, slow and not very manoeuvrable Sæl would not {{stand a chance against}} the three fast and modern opponents.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{acquisition}} in 1944 the Navy {{renamed the}} Auxiliary <b>Mine</b> <b>Layer</b> ACM-11 and, upon reclassification to Minelayer, Auxiliary on 7 February 1945, MMA-11. On 1 May 1945 the name Camanche {{was given the}} vessel. The name had previously been used for an 1863/1864 monitor. As the lead ship of the second group of Army mine planters transferred to Navy the ship gave {{its name to the}} Camanche-class auxiliary mine layers that, with the single exception of the Miantonomah (ACM-13/MMA-13), were immediately placed in reserve and never commissioned, converted or deployed. The ship was sold in 1948 to become the Pilgrim and later the Cape Cod.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 a {{reconstruction}} plan was drawn up: {{seven of the}} remaining boats were to be transformed into flexible units able to serve as gunboat, torpedo boat or fast <b>mine</b> <b>layer.</b> As a result of budget constraints and plans for equivalent modern, all-metal boats, only four of the motosiluranti were converted by the Baglietto shipyards—MS 472, MS 473, MS 474 and MS 481, the others being decommissioned. Extensive changes {{were made to the}} superstructure and hull, including removal of the 533mm torpedo installations; new radio equipment and a radar were installed. The armament included a Bofors 40 mm gun fore, a second Bofors aft, and twin 450mm torpedo launchers or naval mines aft.|$|E

On 8 June 1944, {{he was promoted to}} Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain), backdated to 9 May 1944. In July 1944, Brandi was then appointed U-Admiralstabsoffizier (Asto—officer of the admiralty staff) commander of all U-boat operations in the Gulf of Finland with commanding admiral of the eastern Baltic Sea in Helsinki, under the command of Admiral Theodor Burchardi. Following the loss of the German naval bases in Finland, the German U-boats operated from Danzig, present-day Gdańsk, and Gotenhafen, present-day Gdynia. Their primary area of operations was the passage into the Gulf of Finland. In September–October 1944, Brandi had ordered , , , , , , , [...] and [...] into this area of operations.

On 8/9 October, U-370 sank one Motor Gun Boat and the Finnish trawler No. 764, U-481 sank a Finnish sailboat on 15 October, U-1165 sank one minesweeper and attacked a submarine convoy, U-958 sank two Finnish sailboats, U-1001 torpedoed one trawler on 25 October, and U-475 sank one patrol boat. In November–December 1944, Brandi dispatched U-475, U-958, U-479, U-481, U-679 and U-1165 into the Bottenbusen, {{the northern part of the}} Gulf of Finland, and to the area between Hanko and Rewal. U-679 sank one escort ship and one <b>mine</b> <b>layer</b> and was sunk by the Soviet anti-submarine vessel MO-124 on 9 January 1945. U-481 sank one lighter and probably the [...] on 12 January. U-637 sank one patrol boat.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} system for mining very large spatio-temporal datasets. The system {{comprises}} two main layers: the <b>mining</b> <b>layer</b> and the visualization <b>layer.</b> The <b>mining</b> <b>layer</b> implements a new approach based on a 2 -pass strategy to efficiently support the data-mining process, address the spatial and temporal dimensions of the dataset, and visualize and interpret results. In the first pass, the data objects are grouped according to their close similarity. In the second pass these groups are clustered to produce new models or patterns. The main reason for this 2 -pass strategy is that the datasets are too large for traditional mining and cannot support the interactivity required by the visualization layer...|$|R

50|$|A {{very similar}} engine {{developed}} for the United States Navy was the 540T. This engine used a welded block.
