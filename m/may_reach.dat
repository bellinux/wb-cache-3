5|$|B.sessilis var. sessilis is an autonym that {{encompasses}} the type material of the species. This {{is the most}} widespread variety, occurring from Regans Ford and Moora in the north, south-east to Albany, and inland as far as Wongan Hills, Pingelly and Kulin. Its blue-green leaves are cuneate (wedge-shaped) or oblong, and are usually two to three centimetres long but <b>may</b> <b>reach</b> five.|$|E

5|$|Curves {{that have}} self-crossings <b>may</b> <b>reach</b> {{singularities}} before contracting to a point. For instance, if a lemniscate (any smooth immersed curve {{with a single}} crossing, resembling a figure 8 or infinity symbol) has unequal areas in its two lobes, then eventually the smaller lobe will collapse to a point. However, if the two lobes have equal areas, then they will remain equal throughout {{the evolution of the}} curve, and the isoperimetric ratio will diverge as the curve collapses to a singularity.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat is {{thermal energy}} generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary <b>may</b> <b>reach</b> over 4000°C (7,200°F). The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in {{portions of the}} mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370°C (700°F).|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the {{horticulture}} industry focussed on registered selections of Banksia spinulosa, {{but since the}} late 1990s more and more cultivars of Banksia ericifolia have come on the market, including colour variants and dwarf forms. The latter are particularly attractive as the original plant <b>may</b> <b>reach</b> 6metres in height, and the new cultivars help enthusiasts choose a plant that is right for their conditions and tastes. Banksia ericifolia is also grown for the cut flower industry in Australia, though not {{to the degree that}} the western Australian species such as B.coccinea and B.menziesii are.|$|E

5|$|The Red Canyon Conglomerate, the basal {{member of}} the Moenkopi, fills broad east-flowing paleo{{channels}} carved into the Kaibab Limestone. Some of these channels are up to several tens of feet deep and <b>may</b> <b>reach</b> 200ft (61m) deep in the St. George area. A thin, poorly developed soil, or regolith, formed over the paleotopographic high areas between the channels.|$|E
5|$|The {{global market}} for {{brachytherapy}} reached US$680 million in 2013, {{of which the}} High-Dose Rate (HDR) and LDR segments accounted for 70%. Microspheres and electronic brachytherapy comprised the remaining 30%. One analysis predicts that the brachytherapy market <b>may</b> <b>reach</b> over US$2.4 billion in 2030, growing by 8% annually, mainly driven by the microspheres market as well as electronic brachytherapy, which is gaining significant interest worldwide as a user-friendly technology. The word brachy is Greek for short distance.|$|E

5|$|Viruses <b>may</b> <b>reach</b> {{the lung}} {{by a number}} of {{different}} routes. Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then they touch their eyes or nose. Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the mouth or nose. Once in the upper airway, the viruses may make their way in the lungs, where they invade the cells lining the airways, alveoli, or lung parenchyma. Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex <b>may</b> <b>reach</b> the lungs via the blood. The invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death. When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur. Primarily white blood cells, mainly mononuclear cells, generate the inflammation. As well as damaging the lungs, many viruses simultaneously affect other organs and thus disrupt other body functions. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can arise as a co-morbid condition.|$|E
5|$|Whales were {{historically}} {{common in}} continental and marginal waters such as Hallaniyat Islands, along Indian coasts, Persian Gulf and Gulf of Aden and recent migrations {{into the gulf}} including by cow-calf pairs. It is unknown whether whales seen in the Red Sea originate in this population, however sightings increased since in 2006 even {{in the northern part}} of the sea such as in Gulf of Aqaba. Individuals <b>may</b> <b>reach</b> the Maldives, Sri Lanka, or further east. Humpbacks have been considered rather vagrant into Persian Gulf, however new studies indicate more regular presences can be expected.|$|E
5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV <b>may</b> <b>reach</b> several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E
5000|$|Also on 6 May, Grobba and {{his mission}} flew from Foggia to Rhodes in two Heinkel 111 bombers which were dubbed the [...] "Führer Courier Squadron." [...] The mission was {{accompanied}} by two Messerschmitt 110 fighters. On 9 <b>May,</b> they <b>reached</b> Aleppo in Vichy French-held Syria. On 10 <b>May,</b> the mission <b>reached</b> Mosul and after contacting the Iraqi government, Grobba was told to come to Baghdad as soon as was possible.

5|$|In the {{northern}} areas, the species {{can be found}} in Alaska, Iceland, northern Scandinavia, Greenland and Russia. These are not only particular, specialised species; according to an overview study, more than 150 species were found in the arctic and subarctic regions of Iceland, Greenland, northern Russia and Alaska. These distinctly exceed the tree line. In Greenland, the habitat <b>may</b> <b>reach</b> the 77th latitude line. The Myxogastria species reach their largest biodiversity and highest frequency in forests of temperate regions, which are ideal habitats because of the amount of rich organic material, suitable humidity (not too high) and long-lasting snow cover for snow-inhabiting species.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{occur on}} all continents except Antarctica, and occupy almost all {{terrestrial}} habitats, ranging {{as far north}} as the Arctic Circle in Iceland, Norway, and Central Russia, and as far south as Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. Typically forest floor dwellers, they live in leaf litter, dead wood, or soil, with a preference for humid conditions. In temperate zones, millipedes are most abundant in moist deciduous forests, and <b>may</b> <b>reach</b> densities of over 1,000 individuals per square metre. Other habitats include coniferous forests, deserts, caves, and alpine ecosystems. Some species can survive freshwater floods and live submerged underwater for up to 11 months. A few species occur near the seashore and can survive in somewhat salty conditions.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah, like {{virtually}} all {{species in the}} genus, is a scrambling vine. The stem usually grows along the ground, but will attempt to climb whenever it comes into contact with an object that can support it. The stem is relatively thick (≤30mm) and <b>may</b> <b>reach</b> up to 6 m in length, although it rarely exceeds 3 m. N. rajah does not produce runners as some other species in the genus, but older plants are known to form basal offshoots. This is especially common in plants from tissue culture, where numerous offshoots may form at a young age.|$|E
