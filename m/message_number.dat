50|$|At {{one point}} before World War II, the U.S. FCC defined (at least for {{domestic}} police radio traffic) a station serial number as a sequential <b>message</b> <b>number</b> that was reset {{at the beginning}} of each calendar month.|$|E
50|$|In OpenVMS, {{success is}} {{indicated}} by odd values and failure by even values.The value is a 32 bit integer with sub-fields: control bits, facility number, <b>message</b> <b>number</b> and severity. Severity values are divided between success (Success, Informational) and failure (Warning, Error, Fatal).|$|E
50|$|Multisignature: A multisignature {{represents}} {{a certain number}} of signers signing a given <b>message.</b> <b>Number</b> of signers is not fixed and signers identities are evident from a given multi-signature. A multisignature is much shorter (sometimes constant) than the simple collection of individual signatures.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the general}} {{structure}} of a SYNOP <b>message.</b> <b>Numbers</b> shown here are fixed (group indicators), numbers replacing the x's contain the weather data plus information about the station's position (and speed and direction where applicable).|$|R
50|$|The Nokia Asha 310 also {{contains}} the following messaging features: Instant messaging, Multiple SMS deletion, Text messaging, Automatic resizing of images for MMS, Multimedia messaging, Conversational chat style SMS, Unified inbox for SMS and MMS, Concatenated SMS for long <b>messages,</b> <b>Number</b> screening for <b>messaging,</b> Picture messaging.|$|R
30|$|Proof: The total <b>number</b> of <b>messages</b> MC_QoSLocV SDP of our QoSLocVSDP {{during the}} {{simulation}} period T comprises: {{the total number}} of QoS-based advertisement <b>messages,</b> the total <b>number</b> of QoS-based request <b>messages,</b> the total <b>number</b> of QoS-based election <b>messages,</b> the total <b>number</b> of QoS-based local reply messages and {{the total number of}} QoS-based reply messages. We deduce our theorem from Lemmas 6 - 10.|$|R
50|$|A nonce {{may be used}} {{to ensure}} {{security}} for a stream cipher. Where the same key is used for more than one message and then a different nonce is used to ensure that the keystream is different for different messages encrypted with that key; often the <b>message</b> <b>number</b> is used.|$|E
50|$|For {{ease of use}} {{and general}} {{security}} the large block version is to be preferred when applicable for the following reasons.* A single bit change will change about {{one half of the}} bits of the entire block, leaving no place where the changes start.* There is no choice of mode involved.* Even if the correct usage of always changing the data sent (possibly by a <b>message</b> <b>number)</b> is employed, only identical messages give the same result and the information leakage is minimal.* The <b>message</b> <b>number</b> should always be checked as this redundancy is the check against a random message being accepted.* Cut and join attacks {{do not appear to be}} possible.* If it is not acceptable to have very long messages, they can be broken into chunks say of 60 words and chained analogously to the methods used for DES.|$|E
5000|$|Systems that {{implement}} greylisting work {{fine with}} VERP if the envelope sender follows the above mentioned format. However, some VERP implementations use <b>message</b> <b>number</b> or random key {{as part of}} VERP, which causes each post to the mailing list to be delayed unless the greylisting system treats [...] "similar" [...] sender addresses as being equivalent.|$|E

5000|$|SERVICE MESSAGES: The {{precedence}} of a SVC message {{should be}} {{the same as that of}} the message being serviced. SVC ahead of a <b>message</b> <b>number</b> indicates a service message sent between stations relative to message handling, or delivery. Since they affect timely delivery, they are handled before routine messages. SVC is not a precedence ...|$|E
50|$|Most {{messages}} have {{a somewhat}} maternal tone {{and they often}} ask the faithful to follow Jesus and not deviate from His path. For instance, <b>message</b> <b>number</b> 110 of September 25, 1976, warns against diluting {{the words of the}} Gospel and creating “your own Gospel with your own words” rather than following the original teachings of Jesus.|$|E

In the OS/2, errors are reported in the chosen language of the system, their text being taken from the system message files. The HELP command can then be issued with the error <b>message</b> <b>number</b> to obtain further information.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title is}} a coded <b>message</b> using <b>numbers</b> and the {{corresponding}} letter of the English alphabet; it spells [...] "DEFACTO" [...] (4=D, 5=E, 6=F, 1=A, 3=C, 20=T, 15=O).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} new {{formulation}} of the index coding problem, where instead of demanding a specific message, clients are “pliable ” and are happy to receive any one message they do not have. We prove that with this relaxation, although some instances of this problem become simple, in general the problem remains NP-hard. However, we develop heuristic algorithms that in our (extensive) experimental evaluation required only a logarithmic (in the <b>number</b> of <b>messages)</b> <b>number</b> of broadcast transmissions; this is an exponential improvement over traditional index coding requirements. I...|$|R
50|$|Adding digits in all-caps styled texts may {{multiply}} these confusions, {{which is}} one aim of Leet (intentional pseudo duplicates) and can provide simple means of concealing <b>messages</b> (often <b>numbers).</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>message</b> <b>number</b> is {{selected}} by the station originating the message {{and it must be}} on all messages. It stays with the message {{all the way to the}} point of delivery. The delivering station may need to reply to the station of origin and refer to this number. Use number digits only, no letters, leading zeros, or dashes. Numbers are usually begun with 1 at the start of a year or month at the pleasure of the originating station.|$|E
50|$|The server will {{action the}} message (each <b>message</b> <b>number</b> has a {{specific}} {{meaning to the}} particular process) and respond with a return code. The return code is commonly used to designate whether the process is allowed to proceed or not. The server will usually be written in such way that the manufacturing process flow is mapped and the Server will therefore not allow manufacturing to progress to the next stage if the previous stage is incomplete or failed for some reason.|$|E
5000|$|WMI event tracing is {{an example}} of a {{technology}} that addresses in particular performance of tracing in performance-critical code such as drivers. It can also address the concern of controlling the distribution of sensitive trace information by letting a developer define the human-readable tracing data ( [...] in the example above) separately from the code so that it is not built into the product (in the code, a specific message is referred to by its <b>message</b> <b>number).</b> However, there are some important limitations: ...|$|E

50|$|Each {{computer}} may {{act as a}} server, a client, or both. In {{the server}} configuration a listening socket is opened on a specific port (default port is 99) and the server waits for connection attempts from its clients. The client connects by opening a socket and sending data to the server in the format HeaderData. The header contains information about the message such as the message length, <b>message</b> <b>number</b> which can be anything from 1 to 4,294,967,295 and the part unique identifier or serial number which is limited to 10 digits (9,999,999,999 max). The serial number consists of the year 4 digits, {{the day of the}} year (0-366) 3 digits and a 3 digit sequential number.|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} communications {{mechanism in}} the Microwindows API is the message. A message {{consists of a}} well-known <b>message</b> <b>number,</b> and two parameters, known as wParam and lParam. Messages are stored in an application's message-queue, and retrieved via the GetMessage function. The application blocks while waiting for a message. There are messages that correspond to hardware events, like WM_CHAR for keyboard input or WM_LBUTTONDOWN for mouse button down. In addition, events signaling window creation and destruction WM_CREATE and WM_DESTROY are sent. In most cases, a message {{is associated with a}} window, identified as an HWND. After retrieving the message, the application sends the message to the associated window's handling procedure using DispatchMessage. When a window class is created, its associated message handling procedure is specified, so the system knows where to send the message.|$|E
5000|$|The MMP {{does not}} have its own {{distinct}} doctrine for consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary but relies on the general consecration doctrine provided by the Holy See. The concept of unity and devotion to the Pope also embeds {{the concept of a}} return to the original divine teachings of Jesus which the MMP views as being diluted through modern human interpretations and multiple rationalizations. The concept of leading the faithful to the Virgin Mary is essentially expressed in <b>message</b> <b>number</b> 25 of November 1, 1973, in which priests are asked to gather the faithful around them as [...] "invincible cohort" [...] to follow the path of Jesus. The MMP places special emphasis on the power of praying the Holy Rosary and Eucharistic Adoration as effective means of strengthening the Church.|$|E
