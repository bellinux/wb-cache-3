40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} skills supporting safe and comfortable interaction between humans is their capability to understand intuitively each other’s actions and intentions. At {{the basis of this}} ability is a special-purpose visual processing that human brain has developed to comprehend human motion. Among the first “building blocks” enabling the bootstrapping of such visual processing is the ability to detect movements performed by biological agents in the scene, a skill mastered by human babies in the first days of their life. In this paper, we present a computational model {{based on the assumption that}} such visual ability must be based on local low-level visual motion features, which are independent of shape, such as the configuration of the body and perspective. Moreover, we implement it on the humanoid robot iCub, embedding it into a software architecture that leverages the regularities of biological motion also to control robot attention and oculomotor behaviors. In essence, we put forth a model in which the regularities of biological <b>motion</b> <b>link</b> perception and action enabling a robotic agent to follow a human-inspired sensory-motor behavior.

Multi-body structure-and-motion (MSaM) is {{the problem}} to {{establish}} the multiple-view geometry of an image sequence of a 3 D scene, where the scene consists of multiple rigid objects moving relative to each other.

We give a solution for sequences of several images, full perspective projection, and general rigid motion. It {{can deal with the}} fact that the set of correspondences changes over time, and is robust to outliers. The proposed solution is based on Monte-Carlo sampling and clustering of two-view <b>motions,</b> <b>linking</b> them through the sequence, and model selection to yield the best explanation for the entire sequence. ...|$|R

The 2. 6 Å {{resolution}} crystal structure of Thermotoga maritima CheA (290 - 671) histidine kinase reveals a dimer where the functions of dimerization, ATP binding, and regulation are segregated into domains. The kinase domain is unlike Ser/Thr/Tyr kinases but resembles two ATPases, Gyrase B and Hsp 90. Structural analogies within this superfamily suggest that the P 1 domain of CheA provides the nucleophilic histidine and activating glutamate for phosphotransfer. The regulatory domain, which binds the homologous receptor-coupling protein CheW, topologically resembles two SH 3 domains and provides different protein recognition surfaces at each end. The dimerization domain forms a central four-helix bundle about which the kinase and regulatory domains pivot on conserved hinges to modulate transphosphorylation.

40|$|Finalist of the Best Paper Award on Safety Security and Rescue RoboticsInternational audienceThis paper {{addresses}} the motion planning {{problem of a}} jumping point-robot. Each jump consists in a ballistic <b>motion</b> <b>linking</b> two positions in contact with obstacle surfaces. A solution path is thus a sequence of parabola arcs. The originality of the approach is to consider non-sliding constraints at contact points: slipping avoidance is handled by constraining takeoff and landing velocity vectors to 3 D friction cones. Furthermore the magnitude of these velocities is bounded. The ballistic motion lying in a vertical plane, we transform the 3 D problem into a 2 D one. We then solve the motion equations. The solution gives rise to an exact steering method computing a jump path between two contact points while respecting all constraints. The method is integrated into a standard probabilistic roadmap planner. Probabilistic completeness is proven. Simulations illustrate {{the performance of the}} approach...|$|R

The aim of research is to examine pulsed power supply and oscillating motion pulsating current synchronous drive system, in order to maximize the reactive power usage and increase drive efficiency.

40|$|Critical {{analysis}} of the literature, geomorphologic and geoarchaeological surveys on the mainland and submerged landscape of Campania, allow to evaluate types, entity and rates of ground vertical motions responsible of archaeological heritage submersion and shoreline erosion. Discrimination of vertical <b>motions</b> <b>linked</b> to bradyseism, volcano-tectonic and subsidence are fundamental for the comprehension of coastal morphodinamics from Greek and Roman ages to the current, {{as well as for}} the evaluation of related risk, in order to plan interventions for archaeological heritage safeguard. The ancient sea levels registered along the Campania coastal sectors show geomorphologic elements related to their settlement phases during the Quaternary. Shorelines are often located at various elevations and through different ways, so they supply information about eustatism and volcano-tectonics. The study of archaeological structures allow to deduce both palaeo-sea level traces and ground vertical deformations in the illustrated case studies. In particular, different sectors of the Gulf of Naples were inspected, among which (i) the Vesuvius coast (Castellammare di Stabia-Portici), (ii) the Neapolitan-Phlegrean area (Castel dell’Ovo-Posillipo and Baia-Capo Miseno), (iii) the Phlegrean Islands (Procida, Vivara, Ischia), finally (iv) the Gulf of Gaeta (Torregaveta-Sinuessa). Preliminary results underline differential vertical <b>motions</b> <b>linked</b> to (i) volcano-tectonic, (ii and iii) bradyseism, (iv) complex vertical movements (bradyseism, subsidence, tectonics and volcano-tectonic). The highest values registered (e. g. - 4. 3 m along the Vesuvius coast, - 4. 5 /- 12 m along the Neapolitan-Phlegrean coast, - 3. 5 /- 11 m at Torregaveta-Sinuessa and - 9 /- 4. 5 m in the islands of Vivara and Ischia, respectively) change in the different morphostructural sectors of the Gulf of Naples, resulting usually higher than 2 mm/y which represents the average subsidence rate during the last 130 ky (Tyrrhenian). Among the case studies, the underwater survey of Sinuessa area was particularly interesting: actually, it was possible to reconstruct the coastline morphoevolution phases through the identification of geoarchaeological markers as a carved millstone, 24 Roman pilae, amphorae and anchors fields. The highest value of ground vertical downlift (- 7 m) likely indicates recent tectonic activity.
