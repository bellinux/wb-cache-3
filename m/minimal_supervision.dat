40|$|Summary. Recent {{developments}} of autonomous unmanned vehicles and sensor systems allow automated approaches to surveillance with <b>minimal</b> human <b>supervision</b> or intervention. Indeed {{as the number}} of vehicles increases it becomes increasingly difficult and even impossible for direct human supervision. Our work addresses the generation of team flight plans and controllers that enable a heterogeneous team of UXVs to acquire information for spatial and temporal situational awareness. The paper describes our overall framework and algorithms for the computation of trajectories that maximize spatio-temporal coverage while satisfying hard constraints such as collision avoidance and specifications on initial and final positions. ...|$|R

The consistent linearity of the upgraded BSI platform overcame {{the limitation of}} its predecessor in underestimating the BSI values in patients with a higher (> 5 BSI) tumor burden [7]. Additionally, the upgraded automated BSI demonstrated that with <b>minimal</b> manual <b>supervision,</b> it can standardize the inter-operator variability {{in the assessment of}} change in bone scan. The result demonstrated the reliability of automated BSI in assessing change in bone scan and served as the foundation for future clinical studies.|$|R
50|$|Analyst {{positions}} typically require {{at least}} a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field, and a master's degree may be required. Previous information technology experience - preferably in a similar role - is required as well.

Flexibility, the ability to work well in teams, and the ability to work well with <b>minimal</b> <b>supervision</b> are also preferred traits.|$|E
50|$|Because of the diminished {{need for}} trained labor, {{families}} of slaves on cotton and rice plantations would often remain together, {{bought and sold}} as complete packages. Individual life expectancies were generally shorter, because their skill set was less refined and workers were easily replaced if killed. Cotton and rice plantation owners employed a management technique called “tasking”, in which each slave would receive around one-half acre of land to tend individually with <b>minimal</b> <b>supervision.</b> The weight of the yield from each slave’s plot was interpreted as a direct reflection {{of the quality of}} his work.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} {{the performance and}} usefulness of three semantic background knowledge sources for predicting synonymous anatomical terms across species boundaries. The reference sources under evaluation are UMLS, FMA-OBO and WordNet, which are applied to the anatomical ontologies of mouse and zebrafish. Our {{results show that the}} use of specialized knowledge sources leads to highly accurate predictions, verified through complete manual curation, which can be further improved by combining multiple of said sources. We argue that these three references complement each other in terms of granularity and specificity. From our results we conclude that these references can be used to create reliable ontology mappings with <b>minimal</b> human <b>supervision...</b>|$|R

Being non-hierarchical, there are no bosses, owners, investors, managers or supervisors to direct the work. Therefore work occurs with <b>minimal</b> <b>supervision.</b> Priorities are identified, and results achieved, by the input of those participants who have the most insight into what is required for the task to be done; this is coupled with the agreement and assumption of responsibility of the other participants.|$|E

The Hudson's Bay Company—which was chartered in 1670—had been opening fur trading posts throughout Inuit and First Nations territory.
