5|$|Manta {{rays are}} subject to other {{anthropogenic}} threats. Because <b>mantas</b> must swim constantly to flush oxygen-rich water over their gills, they are vulnerable to entanglement and subsequent suffocation. <b>Mantas</b> cannot swim backwards and, because of their protruding cephalic fins, are prone to entanglement in fishing lines, nets, and even loose mooring lines. When snared, <b>mantas</b> often attempt to free themselves by somersaulting, tangling themselves further. Loose, trailing line can wrap around and cut its way into its flesh, resulting in irreversible injury. Similarly, <b>mantas</b> become entangled in gill nets designed for smaller fish. Some <b>mantas</b> are injured by collision with boats, especially in areas where they congregate and are easily observed. Other threats or factors that may affect manta numbers are climate change, tourism, pollution from oil spills, and the ingestion of microplastics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mantas</b> {{are found}} in warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters. Both species are pelagic; M. birostris migrates across open oceans, singly or in groups, while M. alfredi tends to be resident and coastal. They are filter feeders and eat large quantities of zooplankton, which they swallow with their open mouths as they swim. Gestation lasts over a year and <b>mantas</b> give birth to live pups. <b>Mantas</b> may visit cleaning stations {{for the removal of}} parasites. Like whales, they breach, for unknown reasons.|$|E
5|$|Sites {{at which}} manta rays congregate attract tourists, and manta viewing generates {{substantial}} annual revenue for local communities. Tourist sites {{exist in the}} Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Spain, the Fiji Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, Hawaii, Western Australia and the Maldives. <b>Mantas</b> are popular because of their enormous size {{and because they are}} easily habituated to humans. Scuba divers may get a chance to watch <b>mantas</b> visiting cleaning stations and night dives enable viewers to see <b>mantas</b> feeding on plankton attracted by the lights.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{increasing}} popularity of this dive the conservation {{and protection of}} <b>manta</b> rays has become a priority for dive operators and organizations. <b>Manta</b> rays {{in other parts of}} the Pacific Ocean have been hunted by fishermen as a result of {{the increasing}} demand for <b>manta</b> ray gill plates. Local organizations, such as the <b>Manta</b> Pacific Research Foundation, try to protect the local <b>manta</b> rays and educate the public about <b>manta</b> rays and other sea life. The <b>Manta</b> Pacific Research Foundation's mission is to [...] "study <b>manta</b> rays in their natural habitat, conduct scientific research, provide education programs for the public about <b>manta</b> rays and the marine environment, and to establish and promote global <b>manta</b> ray conservation". As a result of <b>manta</b> rays' fragile biological composition, guidelines to protect the health of the <b>manta</b> rays at this dive have been set forth by The Ocean Recreation council of Hawaii and PADI's Project AWARE. The guidelines are strictly enforced by dive operations that conduct this dive.|$|R
5|$|<b>Mantas</b> {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie on the underside of the head, while in <b>mantas</b> they are right at the front. Manta rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|Swimming {{behavior}} in <b>mantas</b> differs across habitats: when travelling over deep water, they swim {{at a constant}} rate in a straight line, while further inshore they usually bask or swim idly around. <b>Mantas</b> may travel alone or in groups of up to 50. They may associate with other fish species as well as sea birds and marine mammals. <b>Mantas</b> sometimes breach, leaping partially or entirely out of the water. Individuals in a group may make aerial jumps one after the other. These leaps come in three forms: forward leaps where the fish lands head first, similar jumps with a tail first re-entry or somersaults. The reason for breaching is not known; possible explanations include mating rituals, birthing, communication, or the removal of parasites and commensal remoras (suckerfish).|$|E
5|$|<b>Mantas</b> {{move through}} the water by the wing-like {{movements}} of their pectoral fins, which drive water backwards. Their large mouths are rectangular, and face forward as opposed to other ray and skate species with downward-facing mouths. The spiracles typical of rays are vestigial, and <b>mantas</b> must swim continuously to keep oxygenated water passing over their gills. The cephalic fins are usually spiralled, but flatten during foraging. The fish's gill arches have pallets of pinkish-brown spongy tissue that collect food particles. <b>Mantas</b> track down prey using visual and olfactory senses. They {{have one of the}} highest brain-to-body mass ratios and the largest brain size of all fish. Their brains have retia mirabilia which may serve to keep them warm. M. alfredi has been shown to dive to depths of over 400 m, while their relative Mobula tarapacana, which has a similar structure, dives to nearly 2000 m; the retia mirabilia probably serve to prevent their brains from being chilled during such dives into colder subsurface waters.|$|E

5000|$|Project <b>Manta</b> - The <b>manta</b> ray is the world’s largest ray; it is {{an iconic}} species with a {{worldwide}} distribution however recent demand in Asia for <b>manta</b> ray products has led to significant population declines in many regions. This project is a comprehensive study of <b>manta</b> rays (<b>Manta</b> birostris and M. alfredi) to simultaneously enhance knowledge of the species, develop a <b>Manta</b> Identification Database, generate economic and social benefits and {{provide a basis for}} long-term monitoring of its environment.|$|R
5|$|The ancient Peruvian Moche people worshipped {{the sea and}} its animals. Their art often depicts manta rays. Historically, <b>mantas</b> were {{feared for}} their size and power. Sailors {{believed}} that they ate fish and could sink boats by pulling on the anchors. This attitude changed around 1978 when divers around the Gulf of California {{found them to be}} placid and that they could interact with the animals. Several divers photographed themselves with <b>mantas,</b> including Jaws author Peter Benchley.|$|E
5|$|Besides these {{international}} initiatives, {{some countries}} {{are taking their}} own actions. New Zealand has banned the taking of manta rays since {{the introduction of the}} Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to manta fishing as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, the taking of <b>mantas</b> was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen. Fish stocks were surveyed in 2002, and the ban was reintroduced. The taking or killing of <b>mantas</b> in Mexican waters was prohibited in 2007. This ban may not be strictly enforced, but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucatán Peninsula, where manta rays are used to attract tourists.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Hawaii {{became the}} first of the United States to {{introduce}} a ban on the killing or capturing of manta rays. Previously, there was no fishery for <b>mantas</b> in the state, but migratory fish that pass the islands are now protected. In 2010, Ecuador introduced a law prohibiting all fishing for manta and other rays, their retention as bycatch, and their sale.|$|E

5|$|A map of Vilnius {{published}} in 1942, while {{the city was}} under Nazi rule, shows {{the northern part of}} Žirmūnai as Paneriškės, the middle section as Kareiviškės ("place of soldiers") and the southern part, close to the Tuskulėnai Manor, as Mantiškės ("a place named in honour of Mantas"). One of the streets in the area, Enriko Manto Street, referred to Herkus <b>Mantas</b> (Herkus Monte), a hero of the Great Prussian Uprising; today H. Manto Street is a short street in the Šnipiškės elderate ending at the boundary of Žirmūnai.|$|E
5|$|Both {{commercial}} and artisanal fisheries have targeted <b>mantas</b> for their meat and products. They are typically caught with nets, trawls and harpoons. <b>Mantas</b> were once captured by fisheries in California and Australia for their liver oil and skin; {{the latter were}} used as abrasives. Their flesh is edible and is consumed in some countries, but is unattractive compared to other fish. Demand for their gill rakers, the cartilaginous structures protecting the gills, has recently entered Chinese medicine. To fill the growing demand in Asia for gill rakers, targeted fisheries have developed in Philippines, Indonesia, Mozambique, Madagascar, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil and Tanzania. Each year, thousands of manta rays, primarily M. birostris, are caught and killed purely for their gill rakers. A fisheries study in Sri Lanka and India estimated that over 1000 were being sold in the country's fish markets each year. By comparison, M. birostris populations at most of the key aggregation sites {{around the world are}} estimated to have significantly fewer than 1000 individuals. Targeted fisheries for manta rays in the Gulf of California, the west coast of Mexico, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines have reduced populations in these areas dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} listed as {{vulnerable}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer to shore. Areas where <b>mantas</b> congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Indonesia {{has brought}} in a fishing and export ban as it has {{realized}} that <b>manta</b> ray tourism is more economically beneficial than allowing the fish to be killed. A dead <b>manta</b> is worth $40 to $500 while <b>manta</b> ray tourism can bring in $1 million during {{the life of a}} single <b>manta</b> ray. Indonesia has 5.8 million square kilometers (2.2 million square miles) of ocean and this is now the world's largest sanctuary for <b>manta</b> rays.|$|R

5|$|In 2011, <b>mantas</b> became {{strictly}} {{protected in}} international waters {{because of their}} inclusion in the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The CMS is an international treaty organization concerned with conserving migratory species and habitats on a global scale. Although individual nations were already protecting manta rays, the fish often migrate through unregulated waters, putting them at increased risk from overfishing. The IUCN declared M. birostris to be 'Vulnerable with an elevated risk of extinction' in November 2011.|$|E
5|$|Authorities {{were still}} not in {{agreement}} and some {{argued that the}} black color morph was a different species from the mostly white morph. This proposal was discounted by a 2001 study of the mitochondrial DNA of both. A 2009 study analyzed the differences in morphology, including color, meristic variation, spine, dermal denticles (tooth-like scales) and teeth of different populations. Two distinct species emerged: the smaller M. alfredi found in the Indo-Pacific and tropical east Atlantic, and the larger M. birostris found throughout tropical, subtropical and warm temperate oceans. The former is more coastal while the latter is more ocean-going and migratory. A 2010 study on <b>mantas</b> around Japan confirmed the morphological and genetic differences between M. birostris and M. alfredi.|$|E
