5|$|The exponentiation {{operation}} with integer exponents <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> directly from elementary arithmetic operations.|$|E
5|$|The binary {{logarithm}} function <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> as {{the inverse}} function {{to the power}} of two function, which is a strictly increasing function over the positive real numbers and therefore has a unique inverse.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} pet species, {{a variety of}} colors, coat types, and other {{features}} that do {{not appear in the}} wild have either been developed, or have appeared spontaneously. Any individual rat <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.|$|E

5|$|There is no widely agreed criterion-based {{definition}} of a heavy metal. Different meanings may {{be attached to the}} term, depending on the context. In metallurgy, for example, a heavy metal <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> on the basis of density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, and a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E
5|$|Bottom time is {{the time}} spent at depth before {{starting}} the ascent. Bottom time used for decompression planning <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom time is defined for the tables before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom time as the elapsed time between leaving the surface {{and the start of}} the final ascent at 10 metres per minute, and if the ascent rate is slower, then the whole of the ascent time needs to be considered part of the bottom time for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E

5000|$|Functions <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> {{within the}} lexical scope of other functions.|$|R
5|$|Many LARPs have game {{rules that}} {{determine}} how characters can affect {{each other and}} the setting. The rules <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> in a publication or created by the gamemasters. These rules may define characters' capabilities, what can be done with various objects that exist in the setting, and what characters can do during the downtime between LARP events. Because referees are often not available to mediate all character actions, players are relied upon to be honest in their application of the rules.|$|E
5|$|Next, the dissimilarity {{function}} is extended from pairs of points to pairs of clusters. Different clustering methods perform this extension in different ways. For instance, in the single-linkage clustering method, {{the distance between}} two clusters is defined to be the minimum distance between any two points from each cluster. Given this distance between clusters, a hierarchical clustering <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> by a greedy algorithm that initially places each point in its own single-point cluster and then repeatedly forms a new cluster by merging the closest pair of clusters.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals are {{generally}} defined as metals with relatively high densities, atomic weights, or atomic numbers. The criteria used, and whether metalloids are included, {{vary depending on}} the author and context. In metallurgy, for example, a heavy metal <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> on the basis of density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, while a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour. More specific definitions have been published, but none of these have been widely accepted. The definitions surveyed in this article encompass up to 96 out of the 118 known chemical elements; only mercury, lead and bismuth meet all of them. Despite this lack of agreement, the term (plural or singular) is widely used in science. A density of more than 5g/cm3 is sometimes quoted as a commonly used criterion and is used in the body of this article.|$|E

25|$|The angle {{between two}} planes (such as two {{adjacent}} faces of a polyhedron) {{is called a}} dihedral angle. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> as the acute angle between two lines normal to the planes.|$|E
25|$|Operationalize {{means to}} put into operation. Operational {{definitions}} are also used to define system states {{in terms of a}} specific, publicly accessible process of preparation or validation testing, which is repeatable at will. For example, 100 degrees Celsius may be crudely defined by describing the process of heating water at sea level until it is observed to boil. An item like a brick, or even a photograph of a brick, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> in terms of how it can be made.
