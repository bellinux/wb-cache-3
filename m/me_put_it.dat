It is the most {{successful}} for what I tried to do. I succeeded more completely in my view with that than with anything else.|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{figured we}} could win if our offense didn't put us into too many holes", said 35-year-old Colts lineman Billy Ray Smith, who {{was playing in}} his last NFL game, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> this way, they didn't put us into any holes we couldn't get out of".|$|E
2500|$|... "You {{may have}} heard {{bits and pieces of}} my new CD on the Internet. The music, unfortunately, was stolen and {{illegally}} played on various websites. But I promise when you hear the finished version of my CD, you'll understand why I've been so protective of my labor of love. I can't understand why people can't let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out when I'm good and ready... It's funky, folky, electronic and melodic. I hope you like it..." ...|$|E
6000|$|I wrapped {{my tears}} in an ellum leaf [...] And left them under a stone, [...] And now men call me mad because I have thrown [...] All folly from <b>me,</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> aside [...] To leave the old barren ways of men ...|$|R
60|$|He {{glanced at}} a little book on his desk, took it up as if to show <b>it</b> <b>me,</b> then <b>put</b> <b>it</b> down again.|$|R
6000|$|... “Your {{meaning is}} tolerably plain, but I {{have been under}} the screw once,” he said. “Now, I don’t wish to rake up {{anything}} that would be painful, but you know {{just as well as}} I do that if I posed as an old friend of yours it would strengthen your hand. You will excuse <b>me</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> plainly, but that is just what I don’t intend to do.” ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{campaign}} {{began in}} earnest on October 16, 2007, when Colbert officially announced his candidacy on his own 11:30 pm–12:00 am EST Comedy Central program, The Colbert Report. Colbert had earlier appeared on The Daily Show, the program immediately preceding his own on the Comedy Central lineup, but had stated that his final declaration of candidacy would be made on a [...] "more prestigious show". Subsequent to his declaration, Colbert appeared on Meet the Press on October 21, 2007, where he asserted the reality of his campaign: [...] "I'm far realer than Sam Brownback, let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> that way," [...] said Colbert.|$|E
2500|$|Many musicians {{have also}} remarked {{on the quality}} of the album and its {{influence}} on their own work. For example, Elton John said, in his notes for Wonder on the 2003 Rolling Stones list of [...] "The Immortals – The Greatest Artists of All Time" [...] (in which Wonder was ranked number 15): [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> this way: wherever I go in the world, I always take a copy of Songs in the Key of Life. For me, it's the best album ever made, and I'm always left in awe after I listen to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on {{his first}} six novels and his rapid writing {{turnover}} later in his career, DeLillo remarked, [...] "I wasn't learning {{to slow down and}} examine what I was doing more closely. I don't have regrets about that work, but I do think that if I had been a bit less hasty in starting each new book, I might have produced somewhat better work in the 1970s. My first novel took so long and was such an effort that once I was free of it I almost became carefree in a sense and moved right through the decade, stopping, in a way, only at Ratner's Star (1976), which was an enormous challenge for me, and probably a bigger challenge for the reader. But I slowed down in the 1980s and '90s." [...] DeLillo has also acknowledged some of the weaknesses of his 1970s works, reflecting in 2007: [...] "I knew I wasn’t doing utterly serious work, let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She says us <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in a flower," [...] Bruno interrupted, [...] "'cause she doosn't want I to get punished. But it {{were really}} <b>me</b> what <b>put</b> <b>it</b> there. Sylvie were picking Dindledums." ...|$|R
60|$|I replied by {{a sign in}} the affirmative. He inquired next if I {{had brought}} his {{portfolio}} with <b>me.</b> I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> at once into his hand.|$|R
6000|$|PEW. Cap'n, do {{you think}} it wise to quarrel with <b>me?</b> I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> to you now, Cap'n, fairly, as between man and man--{{do you think}} it wise? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Emergency call? For <b>me?</b> <b>Put</b> <b>it</b> through." [...] Kramer came awake, {{brushing}} his hair {{back out of}} his eyes. Alarm plucked at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> to the test," [...] {{she heard}} Mrs. Grantly saying. [...] "Let Miss Story try Planchette. There {{may be a}} further message." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, Amy,' said Philip, {{when the}} flower had been duly admired, 'you must let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into the window, for you. It is {{too heavy for}} you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The thing's {{not as easy}} as it looks," [...] Drummond replied. [...] "Thirlwell's not a fool. If you, want <b>me</b> to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> over, you'll have to come up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is one, I believe, in {{the bottom}} of my trunk; one of my sisters told <b>me</b> she <b>put</b> <b>it</b> there, but I cannot say {{positively}} that I have seen it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What could I do?" [...] demanded Ferris, {{amazed and}} furious {{to find himself}} on the defensive. [...] "His telling <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out of my power to act." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it isn't curly," [...] said Maggie forlornly. [...] "And the matron won't let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> up in curl {{papers at}} night. I just wish I was Lizzie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I HAVE {{left this}} terrible thing about once too often already," [...] and Lord Harry {{took it from}} the table. [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> {{in a place of}} safety." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I am bewitched," [...] said Jenkin, {{giving a}} glance towards his dress, [...] "or that these fool's trappings have made as great an ass {{of me as}} of many I have seen wear them; but let line once be rid of the harness, and if you catch <b>me</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> on again, I will give you leave to sell me to a gipsy, to carry pots, pans, and beggar's bantlings, {{all the rest of}} my life." [...] So saying, he retired to change his apparel.|$|R

60|$|He {{seemed at}} a loss {{what to do with}} the girl's shoe he was still holding in his fist. Finally, looking dully at <b>me,</b> he <b>put</b> <b>it</b> down on the chair from which he had risen.|$|R
60|$|EDSTASTON [startled into speech]. Well, {{that your}} Majesty was--was--[soothingly] Well, let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> this way: {{that it was}} rather natural {{for a man to}} admire your Majesty without being a philosopher.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pa, {{you must}} promise {{me to take}} down the {{mahogany}} bed in your room. It--it was mother's. I {{could not bear to}} see them take that. Let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the garret." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, you {{are neither}} of you going to heaven yet. I have the best hopes of you both, with your proud distinctions--a pair of half-fledged eaglets. Now, what is your {{inference}} from all you have told <b>me?</b> <b>Put</b> <b>it</b> into words." ...|$|E
60|$|Fisc. I warrant you, take no {{care of your}} business; leave <b>it</b> to <b>me,</b> I'll <b>put</b> <b>it</b> {{forward in}} your absence: Go, go, you'll lose your opportunity; I'll be at home before you, and sup with you to-night.|$|R
60|$|The damsel eyed me coldly, {{though at}} the moment I was looking quite my best, diffident yet courteous, a perfect gentleman of the old regime. Then she took the bouquet from <b>me</b> and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> down on the dressing-table.|$|R

60|$|Even as I {{formed the}} {{question}} in my mind, the lady's silvery voice, behind <b>me,</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into words. She had drawn aside the curtains of her litter and she was leaning out, her eyes upon those dancing points of brilliance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ma let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on {{the very}} last minute, and it baked so hard I couldn't pick it off. We can give Belinda that piece, so it's just as well," [...] {{observed}} Betty, taking the lead, as her child was queen of the revel.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Ingleby contritely, with a {{trace of}} confusion. [...] "Certainly not. I would never have offered, only we are such old friends; and I {{think that when you}} brought that hat home after buying it you let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Help <b>me</b> to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on," [...] {{he said in}} a {{voice that}} he strove to render steady. Yet {{scarcely}} had I reached the pile and taken up the breast-plate, when he recoiled again from the task. He broke into a torrent of blasphemy.|$|R
60|$|At that Dr Phelps took a {{metal case}} {{out of his}} waistcoat, glanced at it, glanced at <b>me,</b> and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> back again. He leaned over so close to catch the whisper of my {{breathing}} that there seemed a danger of my losing myself in the labyrinth of his downy ear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{fence with}} <b>me,</b> Mountjoy! I'll <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in a milder way, {{if you prefer}} being humbugged. Do you feel any {{interest}} in that perverse girl of mine?" ...|$|R
