40|$|Explorer 46 was {{launched}} into Earth orbit in August 1972 {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of using double-wall structures to protect against meteoroids. The data from the <b>Meteoroid</b> <b>Bumper</b> Experiment on Explorer 46 is reexamined and it is concluded that most of the impacts originated from an Earth orbiting population. The probable source of this orbiting population is solid rocket motors fired in Earth orbit...|$|E
40|$|What is {{currently}} {{known about the}} orbital debris flux is {{from a combination of}} ground based and in-space measurements. These measurements have revealed an increasing population with decreasing size. A summary of measurements is presented for the following sources: the North American Aerospace Defense Command Catalog, the Perimeter Acquisition and Attack Characterization System Radar, ground based optical telescopes, the Explorer 46 <b>Meteoroid</b> <b>Bumper</b> Experiment, spacecraft windows, and Solar Max surfaces...|$|E
40|$|The Explorer 46 Meteoroid Technology Satellite (MTS) {{launched}} from Wallops Island, Va., August 13, 1972, was configured to fit within the Scout heat shield, 86. 36 cm in diameter. In order to package within this envelope, the <b>meteoroid</b> <b>bumper</b> detector panels {{had to be}} rolled up unpressurized and secured to the spacecraft main structure. After the spacecraft was placed in orbit the panels were unrolled by a deployment system and inflated by a pressurization system...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{radiator}} designs {{which will}} survive the meteoroid hazard of near earth orbit {{for five years}} are evaluated for the 25 kW Power System. Weight comparisons of heat pipe radiators and pumped fluid radiators incorporating <b>meteoroid</b> <b>bumpers</b> are presented for the initial 25 kW Power System and growth versions to 250 kW. The heat pipe concept is enhanced by a new design of the thermal interface between the heat pipe and coolant loop. The results show small weight differences between the advanced heat pipe and pumped fluid concepts for heat loads up to about 50 kW. The heat pipe panels have a weight advantage for larger heat loads...|$|R
40|$|In the past, flight {{experiments}} {{to define the}} meteoroid environment near the Earth and in interplanetary space were undertaken. The effectiveness of <b>meteoroid</b> <b>bumpers</b> was investigated. These flight experiments were aboard Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, and Explorer 46. Hypervelocity impact tests were conducted in the laboratory to study protective structures and the composition of meteoroids from the hundreds of meteor spectra obtained. It was also found that manmade debris presented a similar hazard to spacecraft near the Earth. An assessment of that hazard is made in this paper. An analysis of the collision probability problem with much attention given to the population of small untrackable fragments created during explosions is presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{concept is}} {{presented}} for habitat structures based on stowed rigid conical sections assembled by EVA or autonomously. The structures can be deployed in space or on a lunar or similar planetary environment. MLI (multi layer thermal insulation) is employed for thermal protection. Since they are rigid, the structures also act as <b>meteoroid</b> <b>bumpers.</b> Assembled, the sections form an airtight load reacting habitat or tunnel. A preliminary design and sizing is performed on an exemplary {{section of the}} structure, using the design software SST by PS. A. SST sizes and evaluates isogrid, waffle, skin stringer, sandwich, honeycomb, fluted core, monocoque and other shell structures to arrive at an optimum structural design. With SST, the section is sized for general instability, ultimate and limit strength and skin buckling. In addition, a modal analysis and several trade studies are performed. The SST based design is then imported into a 3 D parametric CAD package, NX 6 by Siemens. Both a 3 D solid model and a 2 D shell model are generated, the latter to drive finite element analysis, associatively linked to each other. To further validate the detailed design, CAE and manufacturing, a CAD-associative shell/beam finite element analysis model is created in NX Simulation 6. Global stiffnesses are compared to the SST results. As part of the FE model verification process, a modal analysis of the section is performed with NX NASTRAN as the solver. A repeating sub-section of the isogrid-stiffened structure is {{cut out of the}} CAD model for future detailed stress analysis using Stresscheck by Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a <b>meteoroid</b> <b>bumper</b> in reducing meteoroid penetrations is discussed. The bumper reduced the penetration flux {{by a factor of}} 30 and demonstrated a weight savings of a factor of 6. 9 in the material needed to resist meteoroid penetration. The method of calculating the penetration flux recommended in the NASA space vehicle design criteria for meteoroid damage assessment was found to be very conservative, and changes are suggested. The optimum distribution of material between a bumper and the main wall is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} {{meteoroid}} flux measurements and models for low orbital altitudes of the Space Station {{has been made}} in order to provide information that may be useful in design studies and laboratory hypervelocity impact tests which simulate micrometeoroids in space for design of the main wall of the Space Station. This report deals with the meteoroid flux mass model, the defocusing and shielding factors that affect the model, the probability of meteoroid penetration of the main wall of a Space Station. Whipple (1947) suggested a <b>meteoroid</b> <b>bumper,</b> a thin shield around the spacecraft at some distance from the wall, as an effective device for reducing penetration, which has been discussed in this report. The equations of the probability of meteoroid penetration, the average annual cumulative total flux, and the equations for the thickness of the main wall and the bumper are presented in this report...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{impact simulation}} is currently performed {{with respect to}} Columbus hull components. The man objectives are to establish a data base for an optimum design of meteoroid/debris protection shields (MDPS) as weil as viewport components, and to obtain input data for numerical models which describe the penetration and perforation processes of <b>meteoroid</b> <b>bumper</b> and viewport systems. As expected, it has been experimentally demonstrated that protection against particles {{in the order of}} 1 cm, at relatively low impact (around 3 km/s), is extremely problematic. Applying usual dual-plate Al bumper techniques would require unrealistically thick and heavy systems in order for safely stop such particles, which are eypected to occur within the low earth orbit space debris complex. Preliminary results obtained with multiplate Al targets as well as hybrid target systems (Al-ceramics, Al-Kevlar) indicate that the situation can be considerably improved with respect to the shielding efficiency at a given areal material density. These investigations are still progress. Results of the test series performed with Al dual-plate systems and with laminated glass targets as viewport components are reported and discussed...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study of}} a flat condenser-radiator with a double fin-tube geometry (closed sandwich) with variable tube side-wall thickness was performed for a Rankine space-power electric-generating system. The analysis of the double fin radiator included consideration of tube and header pressure drops, meteoroid protection for the tubes and headers, along with a detailed presentation of the heat rejection analysis and total weight characteristics. The double fin-tube radiator is compared to a conventional central fin-tube configuration on a heat rejection to weight basis for a four-panel radiator configuration. Both fin and tube geometries are compared {{on the basis of}} the same power level, working fluid temperature, tube and header pressure drop, radiator material, and meteoroid protection criteria. A beryllium radiator for a 1 -megawatt system and a columbium alloy radiator for a 5 OO-kilowatt system, both at a radiating temperature of 1700 R, were chosen for the weight and geometry comparison. The conclusion reached indicates a substantial weight savings can be realized with the double fin-tube arrangement if the tube side-wall thickness can be reduced as a result of a possible <b>meteoroid</b> <b>bumper</b> effect of the enclosing fins. Weight reductions compared to the central fin-tube geometry of up to 32 to 39 percent were shown to be possible for the maximum reduction in side- wall thickness in the two examples considered. This result further substantiated the preliminary conclusions given in an earlier reference that compared the double and central fin-tube configurations neglecting the effects of headers, pressure drops, tube wall temperature drop, and powerplant thermodynamic cycle considerations.
