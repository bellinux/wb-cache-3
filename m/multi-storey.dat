5|$|In 1914 the {{graveyard}} was formally deconsecrated and the headstones {{were removed from}} the site, which became a children's playground in the 1930s and subsequently a <b>multi-storey</b> car park.|$|E
5|$|Anup Mahal is a <b>multi-storey</b> structure, which {{functioned as}} the {{administrative}} {{headquarters of the}} kingdom. It has ornate wooden ceilings with inlaid mirrors, Italian tiles, and fine lattice windows and balconies. It has some gold leaf paintings. It is considered {{as one of the}} “grandest construction”.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} two {{purpose-built}} facilities, other facilities in HCI include a table tennis room, street soccer courts, a judo dojo, three-storey library, a gymnasium, a 400-metre track, a multi-purpose hall, a <b>multi-storey</b> carpark, lecture theatres, general laboratories and classrooms. The 31-metre tall Clock Tower of the school is a national monument, {{the only one in}} a Singapore school.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{construction}} of a pier and a promenade in the 19th century, Sheerness acquired the added attractions of a seaside resort. Industry retains its important place in the town and the Port of Sheerness is one of the United Kingdom's leading car and fresh produce importers. The town is the site of one of the UK's first co-operative societies and also of the world's first <b>multi-storey</b> buildings with a rigid metal frame.|$|E
5|$|The Eccles Spinning and Manufacturing Company {{came into}} being {{following}} a meeting called by the Mayor of Eccles, in which concern was expressed at the decline in local industry. Two earlier Eccles mills had been destroyed by fire, resulting in significant local unemployment. Designed by Potts, Son and Hennings of Manchester, Bolton and Oldham, it was opened in 1906. The imposing mill contained a <b>multi-storey</b> spinning mill, engine house and extensive weaving sheds.|$|E
5|$|The large <b>multi-storey</b> {{spinning}} mills came later, {{and five}} survive today. Mill complexes were built at Kirkhall Lane and Firs Lane in Westleigh, and in Pennington and Bedford. Leigh Spinners is a Grade II* listed building. Mather Lane Mill {{close to the}} Bridgewater Canal is a Grade II listed building. More than 6,000people were employed in textiles in Leigh in 1911.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} been marked as a place for {{expansion}} since the 1960s and appeared on several Government plans for growth. Changes have included the County Square shopping centre, the redevelopment of the Templer Barracks at Repton Park, and the award-winning Ashford Designer Outlet. In the 1970s, a controversial ring road scheme and construction of the <b>multi-storey</b> Charter House building destroyed significant parts of the old town, though some areas were spared and preserved.|$|E
5|$|Vehicular {{access to}} the Quays has been {{improved}} by the construction of Broadway Link Road, which links the site to the M602 motorway at junction 2, and by the provision of car parking. The high-rise 2116 space <b>multi-storey</b> car park was completed in August 2009. It is a pre-cast curved structure clad {{in a mixture of}} aluminium mesh panels and shaded aluminium tiles, comprising 11 floors of parking above the development's energy centre and commercial units.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} airport services are further transportation connections, including rail networks, taxi and shuttle services at curbside pick-up areas, and public buses. Large areas for automobile parking, often in co-located <b>multi-storey</b> car parks, are also typical to find at airports. Some airports provide shuttle services to parking garages for passengers and airport employees. Due to the very large scale of international airports, some have constructed shuttle services to transport passengers between terminals. Such systems operate for example, in Singapore Changi Airport and Zurich Airport.|$|E
5|$|Being {{located just}} inside the Lions' Gate, {{one of the major}} entries to the Old City, the East Jerusalem Development Company {{initially}} intended to excavate the reservoir and build a <b>multi-storey</b> car park at the site. This post-1967 plan was rejected by the waqf authorities who own the plot because they feared that clearance work {{at the base of the}} Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound. Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.|$|E
5|$|Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) {{returns to}} his team in {{spectacular}} fashion, walking {{into the middle of}} a hostage situation involving his team and an alien Blowfish, shooting the intoxicated Blowfish in the head. At the Hub, his team question why he left them, and he simply responds that he had found his Doctor and that he belongs at Torchwood. The team is then alerted to a death near a <b>multi-storey</b> car park, where the team detect energy from the Rift on the corpse. Jack, to even his surprise, gets a hologram message on his vortex manipulator from a person he recognises, and leaves the team to talk to him.|$|E
5|$|Since privatisation, further {{improvements}} to infrastructure have begun at the airport, including expansion of runways, car parks and terminals. The <b>multi-storey</b> carpark outside the terminal was completed between 1995 and August 1997 {{at a cost}} of $49 million, providing 3,100 parking spaces, the majority undercover. This initially four-level structure replaced the previous open air carpark outside the terminal. Work commenced on the six-story 276-room Hilton Hotel (now Park Royal) above the carpark in January 1999, which was completed in mid-2000 {{at a cost of}} $55 million. Expansion of the Qantas domestic terminal was completed in 1999, featuring a second pier and 9 additional aircraft stands.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{four stages}} {{take place in}} power plants, flats, {{underwater}} habitats, and space stations in zero gravity, respectively. Every level is an interior space, and consists of <b>multi-storey</b> rooms and corridors divided by interlocking lifts and doors. The player {{is equipped with a}} jet pack to reach higher areas and perform acrobatic manoeuvres such as backflips and rolls. They can also swim and dive underwater. Robots attack the player with shooting flames should they come into contact. Each stage ends with a boss battle, ranging from fire-breathing flowers to robotic fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{land was}} officially renamed Melville Island in late 1804 or early 1805 {{in honour of}} Henry Dundas, Viscount Melville (who at the time had just been {{appointed}} First Lord of the Admiralty). A wooden barracks-style military prison was constructed to house common prisoners, the cornerstone of which was laid in 1808 and is today preserved as a monument, while a <b>multi-storey</b> building was designed to hold officers. As no exchange system was established with the French, the prison quickly became overcrowded. Some Spanish prisoners were also housed in the prison at this time.|$|E
5|$|There is {{relatively}} little parking {{elsewhere on the}} site, other than the 190-space facility at the Sainsbury's supermarket; this is partly mitigated by the retention of the London Road <b>multi-storey</b> car park, located between Block C and the A23 London Road itself. The residential areas in particular have very few dedicated parking spaces. Block K will have 27 spaces to be shared between the hotel and the office building; nine of these will be for disabled drivers. The master plan proposed 34 (including five on-street spaces), {{all of which were}} allocated to the office building.|$|E
5|$|All these {{increasingly}} {{long distances}} {{came at a}} price, as illustrated by filmmaker Werner Herzog in his 1974 documentary The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner. During both the aforementioned events in Oberstdorf and Planica, several athletes including Steiner had far exceeded {{the limits of the}} hill by 'out-jumping' it or simply 'running out of slope'. Jumps were much further than in the 1950s, during which the old Kongsberger technique was still in use. The results were now potentially fatal each time: athletes were coming only metres away from landing on completely flat ground, or the equivalent of falling from a <b>multi-storey</b> building. Furthermore, only a wool cap and goggles – or no headgear at all – were worn; an antiquated feature left unchanged from the very earliest days of ski jumping more than 150 years prior. In 1979, at their 32nd International Ski Congress in Nice, France, the FIS mandated helmets to be worn by athletes at all ski jumping and flying events.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{work began}} on a {{complete}} redevelopment {{of the station}} building. It opened on 1 July 2001, and featured lifts and generally enhanced facilities. Local roads were enhanced to help speed passengers' journeys {{to and from the}} station, and a new <b>multi-storey</b> car park was built to replace the spaces lost to the Royal Mail facility. A dedicated bus interchange was opened in 2003. In 2006, construction started on a new platform face {{on the north side of}} platform 1, to ease congestion for trains toward Birmingham and London. The new platform, platform 4, was opened on 9 May 2007 by rail minister Tom Harris MP. As part of the reconstruction, the waiting room at the east end of platform 1 was demolished, and replaced with an extended waiting area and customer help desk. Platform 1 was subsequently redesignated platform 3. The work cost £3,000,000, and was funded by Network Rail, with First Great Western contributing £100,000 towards the new waiting room and help desk.|$|E
5|$|Major {{landmarks}} in Leigh are the red sandstone parish {{church and}} across the civic square, Leigh Town Hall and its associated shops on Market Street. The Grade II listed Obelisk that replaced the original market cross is also situated here. Many town centre buildings including the Boar's Head public house are in red Ruabon or Accrington bricks, often with gables and terracotta dressings. There are several large <b>multi-storey</b> cotton mills built along the Bridgewater Canal that are a reminder of Leigh's textile industry but most are now underused and deteriorating despite listed building status. Leigh's War Memorial by local architect J.C. Prestwich is at the junction of Church Street and Silk Street and is a Grade II listed structure. St Joseph's Church and St Thomas's Church {{on opposite sides of}} Chapel Street are both imposing churches using different materials and styles.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 Nav Nirman agitation– {{a protest}} against a 20% hike in the hostel food fees at the L.D. College of Engineering in Ahmedabad– snowballed into a {{movement}} to remove Chimanbhai Patel, then chief minister of Gujarat. In the 1980s, a reservation policy {{was introduced in the}} country, which led to anti-reservation protests in 1981 and 1985. The protests witnessed violent clashes between people belonging to various castes. The city suffered some {{of the impact of the}} 2001 Gujarat earthquake; up to 50 <b>multi-storey</b> buildings collapsed, killing 752 people and causing much damage. The following year, a three-day period of violence between Hindus and Muslims in the western Indian state of Gujarat, known as the 2002 Gujarat riots, spread to Ahmedabad; refugee camps were set up around the city.|$|E
5|$|The town {{suffered}} {{very little}} from the bombing {{runs in the}} Second World War that did damage to many English locations. The worst case in Shrewsbury was in 1940, {{a woman and her}} two grandchildren were killed when a cottage was destroyed on Ellesmere Road, the only local air raid deaths. Therefore, many of its ancient buildings remain intact and there was little redevelopment in the 1960s and 1970s, which arguably destroyed the character of many historic towns in the UK. However, some historic buildings were demolished {{to make way for the}} brutalist architectural style of the 1960s, though the town was saved from a new 'inner ring road' due to its challenging geography. Two notable examples of 1960s/70s construction in Shrewsbury were demolished in the 2000s — the Telecom Tower on Smithfield Road and the <b>multi-storey</b> car park at St Austin's Friars.|$|E
5|$|A {{tradition}} of cottage spinning and weaving and improvements to spinning technology by local inventors, Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton, led to {{rapid growth of}} the textile industry in the 19th century. Crompton, whilst living at Hall i' th' Wood, invented the ] in 1779. Streams draining the surrounding moorland into the River Croal provided the water necessary for the bleach works that were a feature of this area. Bleaching using chlorine {{was introduced in the}} 1790s by the Ainsworths at Halliwell Bleachworks. Bolton and the surrounding villages had more than thirty bleachworks including the Lever Bank Bleach Works in the Irwell Valley. The mule revolutionised cotton spinning by combining the roller drafting of Arkwright's water frame with the carriage drafting and spindle tip twisting of James Hargreaves's spinning jenny, producing a high quality yarn. Self-acting mules were used in Bolton mills until the 1960s producing fine yarn. The earliest mills were situated by the streams and river as at Barrow Bridge, but steam power led to the construction of the large <b>multi-storey</b> mills and their chimneys that dominated Bolton's skyline, some of which survive today.|$|E
5|$|Around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, using as the prototype for the three-arched bridge spanning the Avon an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became {{not just a}} means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge and the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, which it resembles, {{it is one of}} the very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, the owners of the Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath. The Georgian streets in the vicinity of the river tended to be built high above the original ground level to avoid flooding, with the carriageways supported on vaults extending in front of the houses. This can be seen in the <b>multi-storey</b> cellars around Laura Place South of Pulteney Bridge, in the colonnades below Grand Parade, and in the grated coal holes in the pavement of North Parade. In some parts of the city, such as George Street, and London Road near Cleveland Bridge, the developers of the opposite side of the road did not match this pattern, leaving raised pavements with the ends of the vaults exposed to a lower street below.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 2007, Burnley {{revealed}} {{plans for}} a £20 million redevelopment of Turf Moor. The plans also included {{the creation of a}} youth academy at the club's training facility at Gawthorpe Hall in nearby Padiham. The plans were detailed in six phases. In the first phase it was planned to move the changing rooms to the corner between the James Hargreaves Stand and the Jimmy McIlroy Stand. The second phase included the demolition of the Cricket Field Stand, a new stand to be built at that end of the ground that would incorporate a hotel, a restaurant and a newly constructed cricket pavilion, and would be able to accommodate 2,500 fans. The redevelopments also included the construction of a <b>multi-storey</b> car park adjacent to the stadium. Other planned improvements include a new club superstore and other retail outlets, and new business offices {{on the site of the}} current club shop. Revealed in the fifth phase was a transformation of the Bob Lord Stand, which will eventually house a multi-screen cinema. The development of a second tier on the Bob Lord stand was later revealed by Burnley chief executive Paul Fletcher, taking the anticipated capacity of Turf Moor to 28,000 spectators.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-18th century, {{the region}} in and around Chadderton was {{dominated}} by dispersed agricultural settlements. During this period the population was fewer than 1,000, broadly consisting of farmers who were involved with pasture, but who supplemented their incomes by working in cottage industries, particularly fustian and silk weaving. A fulling mill at Chadderton by the River Irk was recorded during the Elizabethan era, and during the Early Modern period the weavers of Chadderton had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers' cottages to produce woollens. Primitive early 18th-century industrialisation developed slowly in Chadderton. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved during the mid-18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger, better, and more efficient equipment became apparent. A water-powered cotton mill was built at Chadderton's Stock Brook in 1776. The damp climate below the South Pennines provided ideal conditions for textile production {{to be carried out}} without the thread drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for industrial-scale manufacture of yarn and fabric for the global market. As the Industrial Revolution advanced, socioeconomic conditions in the region contributed to Chadderton adopting cotton spinning in the factory system, which became the dominant source of employment in the locality. The construction of <b>multi-storey</b> steam powered mills followed, which initiated a process of urbanisation and cultural transformation in the region; the population increasingly moved away from farming and domestic weaving in favour of the mechanised production of cotton goods.|$|E
25|$|Includes a {{bus station}} and a <b>multi-storey</b> car {{park at the}} edge of the main {{shopping}} district.|$|E
25|$|Phase 3 {{began in}} early 2016 on {{expanding}} the train station's <b>multi-storey</b> car park. To {{be completed by}} December 2016, the car park will increase in capacity from 450 to over 800 spaces. The expansion of the <b>multi-storey</b> car park will include a new cycle and motorcycle parking, short stay parking, passenger drop off point and a taxi rank adjacent to the car park. A new entrance will be created.|$|E
25|$|The first {{parts of}} the {{development}} to be completed were the <b>multi-storey</b> car park on Liver Street, and the bus station on Canning Place.|$|E
25|$|By the 1950s, {{with its}} {{continuing}} growth, {{the town was}} becoming congested, and the Council decided on another major redevelopment scheme. The Croydon Corporation Act was passed in 1956. This, coupled with national government incentives for office relocation out of London, led to the building of new offices and accompanying road schemes through the late 1950s and 1960s, and the town boomed as a business centre in the 1960s, with many <b>multi-storey</b> office blocks, an underpass, a flyover and <b>multi-storey</b> car parks.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{costs for}} <b>multi-storey</b> parking {{structures}} {{are estimated to}} cost between $25,000 per space, with underground parking costing around $35,000 per space.|$|E
25|$|A {{dominant}} suburban {{element in}} the Frankston area means its residential property mix is not as diverse as areas that are closer to the Melbourne city centre—as the suburb has minimal <b>multi-storey</b> development. However, as the economic hub as well as gateway to the Mornington Peninsula, Frankston {{has been defined as}} one of the nine activity centres in the metropolitan area of Melbourne in various Victorian state government planning policies—which aim to increase <b>multi-storey</b> property development in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD).|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} 1966, there was also further accommodation, in the school {{buildings}} on Chapel Street, a site now occupied by a <b>multi-storey</b> carpark.|$|E
25|$|The {{best known}} {{building}} of the period {{in the region is}} the ruined 8th-century BC <b>multi-storey</b> tower at Yeha in Ethiopia, believed to have been the capital of D'mt.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} a taxi rank, drop-off/pick-up point, and short- and long-stay car parks {{accessible}} from Fairfield Street. The long-stay <b>multi-storey</b> car park {{is at the}} rear of the station.|$|E
25|$|UDDTs with {{combined}} ventilation {{and collection}} systems {{can also be}} installed in urban <b>multi-storey</b> buildings but only one successful {{example of such a}} design exists: the Gebers collective housing estate in Orhem, Sweden.|$|E
25|$|A new <b>multi-storey</b> brick theatre {{was erected}} around 1810 {{on what was}} at the time the north side of H Street (now Broad). There was an {{orchestra}} section, a first balcony, and an upper balcony, with narrow doorways.|$|E
25|$|The new £36 million Olympia {{leisure centre}} with <b>multi-storey</b> car park was {{scheduled}} to open in late 2012, but only three weeks from the original opening date, the date was pushed back by a further six months.|$|E
