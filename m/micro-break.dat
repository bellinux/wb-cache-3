40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that power MOSFETs can experience an SEGR and continue to function with altered parameters. We propose {{that there are three}} different types of SEGR modes; the <b>micro-break,</b> the thermal runaway, and the avalanche breakdown. Data that demonstrates these stages of device failure are presented as well as a proposed model for the <b>micro-break.</b> Brief discussions of the other modes, based on analysis combined with our interpretations of the older literature, are also given...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of micro-breaks on the attention of an assembly worker, by utilizing wireless electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements. The EEG feature of interest {{for this study was}} the P 300 event-related potential (ERP) component and P 3 a and P 3 b sub-components, as these components reflects the ones attention level. Nine students participated the study and completed the simulated manual assembly task, replicated from one of our industrial partner. We used sustained attention to response task (SART), instead of real industrial information that indicates the beginning of the operation. SART paradigm is “go/no-go” task, and in this version of SART, participants are required to respond to all “go” stimuli, in sense of initiating the action of manual assembly operation, and to withhold the action otherwise. The “no-go” condition was considered as <b>micro-break</b> period, since the participants had approximately five seconds to rest during a continuous simulated working routine. Fifty ERPs preceding and following the “no-go” condition were compared. The results revealed that, on the group level, the values of the amplitude of the P 3 b sub-component, which is related to the higher-level attention processing, were significantly higher for the ERPs following than preceding the <b>micro-break</b> period. This finding indicates that the frequent micro-breaks increase the attention of the manual assembly workers...|$|E
40|$|Alan Hedge, Jeffrey HancockFrequent brief rest breaks, {{known as}} micro-breaks, {{have been shown}} to benefit {{computer}} users by reducing fatigue and possibly preventing musculoskeletal disorders. Various methods of reminding users to take rest breaks have been developed. Initially, efforts focused on the use of break reminder computer software, although potentially this may be disruptive to work patterns. More recently, <b>micro-break</b> reminders have been incorporated into computer equipment and these have been indexed to work activity, and this approach may offer less potential for disrupting work activities. 	A computer mouse has been developed that vibrates in the user's hand after 10 seconds of inactivity. The vibration is intended to remind the user to rest his or her hand in a neutral position while not actively engaging the mouse rather than maintaining a grip on the mouse that requires static muscle contraction. A laboratory experiment was conducted to test this vibrating mouse against a conventional mouse to see how it affected subjects' task performance, task behaviors, and mouse preference. It was hypothesized that the vibrating mouse would increase the number of times subjects removed their hands from the mouse, be minimally disruptive and have no adverse effect on task performance. The study also explored what subjects did with their hand when this was removed from the mouse. 	Eleven female and seven male subjects participated in the experiment. Use of the vibrating mouse (experimental condition) was compared to use of a conventional mouse (control condition) for five consecutive tasks. The first three tasks required the finding and correcting of duplicate words, the finding and correcting of duplicate sentences and the finding and correcting of misspelled words from text passages. The final two tasks were a reading comprehension task, where the subjects answered four multiple-choice questions about a text passage, and a composition task in response to a business scenario. 	Subjects were videotaped to collect data on their behavior while completing the tasks under both conditions. Task time and number of errors were collected as performance measures. User preferences and musculoskeletal discomfort were gathered using two questionnaires, one administered pre test and one post test. 	No differences were found in performance between the two conditions. The vibrating mouse induced more positive task behaviors than the conventional mouse, including significantly more resting behavior (p= 0. 02) and slightly more hand removals (p= 0. 06). The vibrating mouse, however, also induced significantly more negative task behaviors than the conventional mouse, such as increasing the frequency of unsupported hand hovering (p= 0. 00). Nine subjects found that the vibrating mouse was disruptive to their performance during the duplicate word and reading tasks; and eight found that the vibrating mouse was disruptive during the duplicate word task. The effectiveness of the mouse seemed to correspond to task type and also to subjects' mouse use technique. 	Because of technological limitations and a desire to limit extraneous distractions to the subjects during the tasks, the vibration occurrence data was collected by subjects' self reporting the number of vibration occurrences they experienced. This subjectiveness may have compromised the reliability of the vibration frequency data. 	The vibrating mouse shows promise but {{more research is needed to}} understand the conditions under which a vibration occurs and therefore when a user would gain benefits from this mouse. The effects of task type and user technique need to be examined in more detail to determine the nature of these effects before recommendations can be made as to the proper implementation of the vibrating mouse.

40|$|Participants {{in human}} {{computation}} workflows may become fatigued or get bored over long, interminable working hours. This {{leads to a}} slump of motivation and morale, which {{in the long run}} causes reductions in both productivity and work quality. In this paper we propose an initial investigation into possible ways to alleviate worker fatigue and boredom by employing <b>micro-breaks</b> that provide timely relax to workers during long sequences of tasks. We experimentally test <b>micro-breaks</b> on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, showing that <b>micro-breaks</b> can significantly improve worker retention rate as task batches reach hours in length, and appear to increase overall worker engagement and commitment to their work...|$|R
40|$|Organizational {{researchers}} and practitioners are increasingly interested in self-regulatory strategies employees can use at work to sustain or improve their occupational well-being. A recent cross-sectional study on energy management strategies suggested that many work-related strategies (e. g., setting a new goal) are {{positively related to}} occupational well-being, whereas many <b>micro-breaks</b> (e. g., listening to music) are negatively related to occupational well-being. We used a diary study design {{to take a closer}} look at the effects of these energy management strategies on fatigue and vitality. Based on conservation of resources theory, we hypothesized that both types of energy management strategies negatively predict fatigue and positively predict vitality. Employees (N = 124) responded to a baseline survey and to hourly surveys across one work day (6. 7 times on average). Consistent with previous research, between-person differences in the use of work-related strategies were positively associated with between-person differences in vitality. However, results of multilevel analyses of the hourly diary data showed that only <b>micro-breaks</b> negatively predicted fatigue and positively predicted vitality. These findings suggest that taking <b>micro-breaks</b> during the work day may have short-term effects on occupational wellbeing, whereas using work-related strategies may have long-term effects.

40|$|Research has {{suggested}} regular breaks in sedentary office work are im-portant for health, wellbeing and long-term productivity. Although many comput-erized break reminders exist, few {{are based on}} user needs and requirements as determined by formative research. This paper reports empirical findings from a diary-probed interview study with 20 office workers on their perceived barriers and facilitators to taking regular <b>micro-breaks</b> at work. This work makes two contributions to the Persuasive Technology (PT) community: a diagnosis of {{the full range of}} determinants and levers for changing office work break behaviours; a demonstration of applying the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW), an intervention development framework originating from Health chology, to elicit theory-based design rec-ommendations for a potential PT...|$|R
40|$|Break {{activities}} [...] {{deliberate and}} unexpected [...] are common throughout the working day, playing {{an important role}} in the wellbeing of workers. This paper investigates the role of increasingly pervasive ICT in creating new opportunities for breaks at work, what impact the technology has on management of boundaries at work, and the effects these changes have on personal wellbeing. We present a study of the routines of office-workers, where we used images from participants' work-days to prompt and contextualize interviews with them. Analysis of coded photographs and interview data makes three contributions: an account of ubiquitous ICT creating new forms of <b>micro-breaks,</b> including the opportunity to employ previously wasted time; a description of the ways in which staff increasingly bring "home to work"; and a discussion of the emergence of "screen guilt". We evaluate our findings in relation to previous studies, and leave three research implications and questions for future work in this domain...|$|R
40|$|Ultra-precision surface {{grinding}} experiments were conducted at two different grinding conditions (rough and fine) {{to study the}} surface finish of RB-SiC/Si and WC/Co carbides, with Si and Co as binders, respectively. It was found that RB-SiC/Si and WC/Co showed {{two different types of}} surface generation mechanism under the same selected grinding conditions: brittle fractured surface of RB-SiC/Si and plastic deformation surface of WC/Co. Obvious <b>micro-breaks</b> occurred on SiC surface with a coarse grit wheel at higher material removal rate, but it changed to micro-pits at the phase boundary with a fine grit wheel at a lower material removal rate. Nevertheless, the surface characteristic only changed from rough grinding traces to finer for WC/Co. It was found that the surface finish of RB-SiC/Si and WC/Co was closely related to the material brittleness. The surface roughness (Ra) of RB-SiC/Si was limited to be about 20 nm under both rough and fine grinding conditions while about 5 nm (Ra) could be achieved for WC/Co under the fine condition. It was also identified that the surface profile of workpieces was replicated from diamond grits. To explain the difference in wavy surface profile at nanoscale, a simple model was built to illustrate the impact of grit wear. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Existing biomechanical {{evidence}} suggests mechanisms of low back injuries and disorders associated with prolonged stooping. However, no research has tested realistic and more natural stooped work conditions with human {{subjects in the}} investigation of the biomechanical responses of the low back in prolonged stooping. The current study was aimed to explore various biomechanical responses of the low back in more realistic and work-related loading and posture conditions of prolonged stooping. Twenty two subjects performed stooped work tasks for 7 min with periodic <b>micro-breaks</b> in upright standing, and various measures for assessing biomechanical responses of the low back were obtained before, during and immediately after the stooped work period. Study results found significant increases (p < 0. 05) in the range of lumbar flexion and myoelectric activation of the low back muscles after the stooped work period. During stooped work, the low back extensor muscles did not show flexion-relaxation. It could be concluded that the natural and unrestricted stooped work conditions produced similar viscoelastic responses of the low back to what more severe stooping conditions with posture restrictions did in previous research, but could be more fatigue-prone due to low but consistent activation of the low back extensor muscles during stooped work activities. close 0...|$|R
40|$|Student {{mental health}} and {{wellness}} is a critical issue facing {{institutions of higher education}} across Canada. Mental illness is predicted to be the leading cause of disability at Canadian universities. This article looks at recent data on how mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression are affecting academic performance. There is a growing consensus amongst university administrators that student mental health is a campus-wide responsibility. Providing students with healthy and positive methods of relaxing and coping with stress is another way that libraries can support learning and academic success and contribute to a campus culture that is supportive of wellness. Two branches of Memorial University Libraries in Newfoundland, the Queen Elizabeth II (QEII) and Grenfell Campus library, have undertaken initiatives, partially through partnering with the university’s Student Services department, to help decrease students’ anxiety levels during the particularly stressful end of semester. These include extended hours, yoga and mindfulness, pet therapy, <b>micro-breaks,</b> and free hot beverages and snacks. Both branches surveyed students to obtain feedback on these initiatives and determine what impact students felt the initiatives had on their stress levels. These events also garnered positive exposure in both social and local media and provided a great promotional opportunity for the libraries...|$|R
