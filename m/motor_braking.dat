5000|$|Large, high-current ESCs {{are used}} in {{electric}} cars, such as the Nissan Leaf, the Tesla Roadster, Model S, Model X and Model 3, and the Chevrolet Bolt. The energy draw is usually measured in kilowatts (the Nissan Leaf, for instance, uses an 80 kilowatt motor that produces 210 foot-pounds of torque). Most mass-produced electric cars use AC motors, which allow the ESC to capture energy when the car coasts, using the motor as a generator and slowing the car down. The captured energy is used to charge the batteries and thus extend the driving range of the car (this is known as regenerative braking). In some vehicles, such as those produced by Tesla, this {{can be used to}} slow down so effectively that the car's conventional brakes are only needed at very low speeds (the <b>motor</b> <b>braking</b> effect diminishes as the speed is reduced). In others, such as the Nissan Leaf, there is only a slight [...] "drag" [...] effect when coasting, and the ESC modulates the energy capture in tandem with the conventional brakes to bring the car to a stop.|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{friction}} braking torque and <b>motor</b> <b>braking</b> torque {{can be used}} in braking for electric vehicles (EVs). A sliding mode controller (SMC) based on the exponential reaching law for the anti-lock braking system (ABS) is developed to maintain the optimal slip value. Parameter optimizing is applied to the reaching law by fuzzy logic control (FLC). A regenerative braking algorithm, in which the motor torque is taken full advantage of, is adopted to distribute the braking force between the <b>motor</b> <b>braking</b> and the hydraulic braking. Simulations were carried out with Matlab/Simulink. By comparing with a conventional Bang-bang ABS controller, braking stability and passenger comfort is improved with the proposed SMC controller, and the chatting phenomenon is reduced effectively with the parameter optimizing by FLC. With the increasing proportion of the <b>motor</b> <b>braking</b> torque, the tracking of the slip ratio is more rapid and accurate. Furthermore, the braking distance is shortened and the conversion energy is enhanced...|$|E

40|$|Hybrid {{vehicles}} {{usually have}} several braking systems, and braking mode switches are significant events during braking. It {{is difficult to}} coordinate torque fluctuations caused by mode switches because the dynamic {{characteristics of braking systems}} are different. In this study, a new type of plug-in hybrid vehicle is taken as the research object, and braking mode switches are divided into two types. The control strategy of type one is achieved by controlling the change rates of clutch hold-down and <b>motor</b> <b>braking</b> forces. The control strategy of type two is achieved by simultaneously changing the target braking torque during different mode switch stages and controlling the motor to participate in active coordination control. Finally, the torque coordination control strategy is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink, and the results show that the proposed control strategy has a good effect in reducing the braking torque fluctuation and vehicle shocks during braking mode switches...|$|E
