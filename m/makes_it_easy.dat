5|$|Copper is used {{to create}} stills for distilling spirits, for example to make whisky. It's {{malleability}} <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to bend into the various shapes required and allows considerable flexibility in the shaping of the still and associated pipework; the metal also reacts with undesirable sulfur-containing components in the vapor and distillate making for a cleaner product.|$|E

She {{is married}} to actor Daniel Lapaine, with whom she has two children—a daughter and a son—and is an advocate of several charities and causes.|$|E
50|$|Sindhi {{has also}} been {{digitized}} to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to publish Sindhi newspapers, magazines and books. InPage also offers support for Sindhi with the proper fonts and ligatures which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for people to type in the Sindhi language without any difficulty.|$|R
50|$|MXNet {{supports}} both imperative {{and symbolic}} programming, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for developers {{that are used}} to imperative programming to get started with deep learning. <b>It</b> also <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to track, debug, save checkpoints, modify hyperparameters, such as learning rate or perform early stopping.|$|R

5|$|This {{species is}} saprobic, and is found growing in {{groups on the}} ground or on moss-covered {{decaying}} wood, especially amongst fallen pine needles. In North America, fruit bodies appear in the spring and summer, and are fairly common; in Britain, the fungus fruits from winter to spring, and is rare. Its small size and dark color <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to overlook.|$|E
5|$|All {{species of}} cone snails are venomous and can sting painfully when handled, {{although}} many species {{are too small}} to pose much of a risk to humans, and only a few fatalities have been reliably reported. Their venom is a complex mixture of toxins, some fast-acting and others slower but deadlier. The effects of individual cone-shell toxins on victims' nervous systems are so precise as to be useful tools for research in neurology, and the small size of their molecules <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to synthesize them.|$|E
5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to spot the navigator by being the one with red eyes from sleep deprivation.|$|E
50|$|Proponents claim a {{particular}} language <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to express and understand concepts in one area, {{and more difficult}} in others. An example can be taken from the way various programming languages <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to write certain kinds of programs and harder to write others.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to environments {{where the}} {{programmer}} needs to avoid or work around hazards, {{use of a}} non-pipelined processor may <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to program and to train programmers. The non-pipelined processor also <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to predict the exact timing of a given sequence of instructions.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, the Consortium {{proposed}} {{and went on}} to create the vCard and vCalendar technologies. vCards were intended to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> for many people using computers connected to the Internet to exchange contact information, while vCalendars were intended to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> for people to swap scheduling information.|$|R
5|$|The {{skin of a}} {{tiger shark}} can {{typically}} range from blue to light green with a white or light-yellow underbelly. The advantage {{of this is that}} when it is hunting for its prey, when prey looks at the shark from above, the shark will be camouflaged since the water below is darker. And when prey is below the shark and looks up, of course because of the sun, it is lighter so that the light underbelly will also camouflage the shark. This is known as countershading. Dark spots and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures. Its head is somewhat wedge-shaped, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to turn quickly to one side. They have small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini, which enable them to detect electric fields, including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey, which helps them to hunt. Tiger sharks also have a sensory organ called a lateral line which extends on their flanks down most of the length of their sides. The primary role of this structure is to detect minute vibrations in the water. These adaptations allow the tiger shark to hunt in darkness and detect hidden prey.|$|E

25|$|The {{peculiar}} morphology of stalk-eyed flies <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> {{to identify}} their fossils (e.g. in amber); one prehistoric genus that has been discovered in that form is Prosphyracephala.|$|E
25|$|Having the PID {{controller}} {{written in}} Laplace form {{and having the}} transfer function of the controlled system <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to determine the closed-loop transfer function of the system.|$|E
25|$|The strength, hardness, and {{flexibility}} of copper {{make it very}} easy to work with. Copper wiring can be installed simply and easily with no special tools, washers, pigtails, or joint compounds. Its flexibility <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to join, while its hardness helps keep connections securely in place. It has good strength for pulling wire through tight places (“pull-through”), including conduits. It can be bent or twisted easily without breaking. It can be stripped and terminated during installation or service with far less danger of nicks or breaks. And it can be connected {{without the use of}} special lugs and fittings. The combination of all of these factors <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> for electricians to install copper wire.|$|E
50|$|Schedule. The {{national}} television channels were {{only on the}} air {{for part of the}} day. This would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> for transmitting the channels throughout the country. For instance, the Fourth Programme aired from 1300-1740 GMT. This would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> for the Fourth Programme to be aired by satellite.|$|R

25|$|Price ending {{has also}} been used by {{retailers}} to highlight sale or clearance items for administrative purposes. A retailer might end all regular prices in 95 and all sale price in 50.

25|$|The {{road network}} in Sha Tin is well {{developed}} to provide efficient cross-town and local access traffic.

25|$|There are 535 {{access points}} where the Pennine Way intersects with other public rights of way. The route is also crossed by many roads and passes through many villages and towns with good public transport. This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to sample a short {{section of the}} trail, or to split the Pennine Way across several {{holidays}} or long weekends.|$|E
25|$|Another issue {{arises when}} the sample for {{detection}} {{is a relatively}} large molecule, such as DNA or protein. In the application for large molecule, clogging is a concern because {{the small size of}} the nanochannel <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to happen. A low friction coating at inner surface of the channel is desired to avoid blocking of fluid channels in this application.|$|E
25|$|The main {{factors that}} {{contribute}} to high levels of trafficking through Atlanta and Houston are proximity, demographics, and a large migrant labor force. The presence of two large airports provides ways {{in and out of the}} city in Houston and in Atlanta having the worlds busiest and largest airport <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy.</b> Proof for the high level of trafficking in Atlanta and Houston includes the high majority of calls to National Trafficking Hotline coming from The Atlanta Center and Houston.|$|E
