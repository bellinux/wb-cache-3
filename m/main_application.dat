5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>application</b> of {{scandium}} {{by weight}} is in aluminium-scandium alloys for minor aerospace industry components. These alloys contain between 0.1% and 0.5% of scandium. They {{were used in}} the Russian military aircraft, specifically the MiG-21 and MiG-29.|$|E
5|$|Analogue filters {{have played}} an {{important}} part in the development of electronics. Especially in the field of telecommunications, filters have been of crucial importance in a number of technological breakthroughs and have been the source of enormous profits for telecommunications companies. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that the early development of filters was intimately connected with transmission lines. Transmission line theory gave rise to filter theory, which initially took a very similar form, and the <b>main</b> <b>application</b> of filters was for use on telecommunication transmission lines. However, the arrival of network synthesis techniques greatly enhanced the degree of control of the designer.|$|E

5|$|Ceria is {{the most}} widely used {{compound}} of cerium. The <b>main</b> <b>application</b> of ceria is as a polishing compound, for example in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). In this application, ceria has replaced other metal oxides for the production of high-quality optical surfaces. Major automotive applications for the lower sesquioxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles, Cerium(IV) sulfate is used as an oxidising agent in quantitative analysis. Cerium(IV) in methanesulfonic acid solutions is applied in industrial scale electrosynthesis as a recyclable oxidant. Ceric ammonium nitrate is used as an oxidant in organic chemistry and in etching electronic components, and as a primary standard for quantitative analysis.|$|E

25|$|The other <b>main</b> <b>application</b> of THF is as an {{industrial}} solvent for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and in varnishes. It is an aprotic solvent with a dielectric constant of 7.6. It is a moderately polar solvent and can dissolve {{a wide range}} of nonpolar and polar chemical compounds. THF is water-miscible and can form solid clathrate hydrate structures with water at low temperatures.|$|E

25|$|The annual {{consumption}} of antimony(III) oxide in the United States and Europe is approximately 10,000 and 25,000 tonnes, respectively. The <b>main</b> <b>application</b> is as flame retardant synergist {{in combination with}} halogenated materials. The combination of the halides and the antimony {{is key to the}} flame-retardant action for polymers, helping to form less flammable chars. Such flame retardants are found in electrical apparatuses, textiles, leather, and coatings.|$|E
25|$|Lethal {{injection}} is {{the practice}} of injecting one or more drugs into a person (typically a barbiturate, paralytic, and potassium solution) {{for the express purpose}} of causing immediate death. The <b>main</b> <b>application</b> for this procedure is capital punishment, but the term may also be applied in a broader sense to include euthanasia and suicide. It first renders the person unconscious, and then stops the breathing and heart, in that order.|$|E
25|$|The two <b>main</b> <b>application</b> {{areas for}} {{single-use}} medically approved PVC compounds are flexible containers and tubing: containers used for blood and blood components, for urine collection or for ostomy products and tubing used for blood taking and blood giving sets, catheters, heart-lung bypass sets, hemodialysis sets etc. In Europe {{the consumption of}} PVC for medical devices is approximately 85,000 tons each year. Almost one third of plastic-based medical devices are made from PVC.|$|E

25|$|One of the <b>main</b> <b>application</b> of CE in {{forensic}} science {{is the development}} of methods for amplification and detection of DNA fragments using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which has to lead to rapid and dramatic advances in DNA typing in forensic. DNA separations are carried out using thin CE, 50-mm, fused silica capillaries filled with a sieving buffer. These capillaries have excellent capabilities to dissipate heat, permitting much higher electric field strengths to be used than slab gel electrophoresis. Therefore separations in capillaries are rapid and efficient. Additionally, the capillaries can be easily refilled and changed for efficient and automated injections. Detection occurs via fluorescence through a window etched in the capillary. Both single-capillary and capillary-array instruments are available with array systems capable of running 16 or more samples simultaneously for increased throughput.|$|E
