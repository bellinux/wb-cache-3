50|$|The {{operating}} {{life of a}} zinc-air cell is a critical function of its interaction with its environment. The electrolyte loses water more rapidly in conditions of high temperature and low humidity. Because the potassium hydroxide electrolyte is deliquescent, in very humid conditions excess water accumulates in the cell, flooding the cathode and destroying its active properties. Potassium hydroxide also reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide; carbonate formation eventually reduces electrolyte conductivity. <b>Miniature</b> <b>cells</b> have high self-discharge once opened to air; the cell's capacity {{is intended to be}} used within a few weeks.|$|E
5000|$|A {{battery is}} a device {{consisting}} {{of one or}} more electrochemical cells that convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy. Since the invention of the first battery (or [...] "voltaic pile") in 1800 by Alessandro Volta and especially since the technically improved Daniell cell in 1836, batteries have become a common power source for many household and industrial applications. According to a 2005 estimate, the worldwide battery industry generates US$48 billion in sales each year, with 6% annual growth. There are two types of batteries: primary batteries (disposable batteries), which are designed to be used once and discarded, and secondary batteries (rechargeable batteries), which are designed to be recharged and used multiple times. Batteries come in many sizes, from <b>miniature</b> <b>cells</b> used to power hearing aids and wristwatches to battery banks the size of rooms that provide standby power for telephone exchanges and computer data centers.|$|E

Attractive features of this combination are the lack of vibration and a long lifetime for a potentially very small cryocooler.

40|$|The {{analytical}} {{performance parameters}} of four different contactless conductivity detectors for capillary electrophoresis were determined. These detectors were designed either with a <b>miniature</b> <b>cell</b> for versatility, with high voltage excitation for high sensitivity {{or with a}} battery power supply for field application. One of the units is commercially available. The plate numbers and reproducibility of peak areas (typically about 2 %) were very similar, indicating that these parameters are generally limited by the separation and injection procedures rather than the detectors. The linear dynamic ranges are better than 2 orders of magnitude for all detectors and the correlation coefficients were also almost identical. Significant differences were found {{with regard to the}} detection limits. For the detector with a <b>miniature</b> <b>cell,</b> which lacks an in-cell amplifier, the detection limit was typically 1. 5 {micro}M for the inorganic ions tested (K+, Ca 2 +, Na+, Mg 2 +, Li+, Cl-, NO 3 - and SO 42 -), while with the other 3 detectors this parameter was as low as about 0. 1 {micro}M.

40|$|Most rod-shape {{model organisms}} such as Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis utilize two {{inhibitory}} systems for correct {{positioning of the}} cell division apparatus. While the nucleoid occlusion system acts in vicinity of the nucleoid, the Min system was thought to protect the cell poles from futile division leading to DNA-free <b>miniature</b> <b>cells.</b> The Min system is composed of an inhibitory protein, MinC, which acts {{at the level of}} the FtsZ ring formation. MinC is recruited to the membrane by MinD, a member of the MinD/ParA family of Walker-ATPases. Topological positioning of the MinCD complex depends on MinE in E. coli and MinJ/DivIVA in B. subtilis. While MinE drives an oscillation of MinCD in the E. coli cell with a time-dependent minimal concentration at midcell, the B. subtilis system was thought to be stably tethered to the cell poles by MinJ/DivIVA. Recent developments revealed that the Min system in B. subtilis mainly acts at the site of division, where it seems to prevent reinitiation of the division machinery. Thus, MinCD describe a dynamic behavior in B. subtilis. This is somewhat inconsistent with a stable localization of DivIVA at the cell poles. High resolution imaging of ongoing divisions show that DivIVA also enriches at the site of division. Here we analyze whether polar localized DivIVA is partially mobile and can contribute to septal DivIVA and vice versa. For this purpose we use fusions with green to red photoconvertible fluorophores, Dendra 2 and photoactivatable PA-GFP. These techniques have proven very powerful to discriminate protein relocalization in vivo. Our results show that B. subtilis DivIVA is indeed dynamic and moves from the poles to the new septum...|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) is a {{worldwide}} pandemic, which claims approximately 2 million lives annually. Though treatable through chemotherapy, TB still causes 8 - 10 million new infections annually. The problem is {{further complicated by}} the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) the causative agent of TB. The unabated spread of this disease and associated high levels of mortality has prompted the search for new drugs with novel modes of action. The peptidoglycan (PG) component of the cell wall of Mtb is an incredibly complex structure and {{has been the focus of}} antimicrobial development in other organisms. In this study, we characterize PG remodelling N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidases (cell wall amidases) in Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm), a model organism for TB research by gene knockout/knockdown. Cell wall amidases cleave the bond between the stem peptide and the glycan backbone in PG and have been shown to play an essential role in cell growth, cell signalling and antibiotic resistance in other organisms. Our bioinformatics analysis revealed that M. smegmatis encodes three possible amidase homologues designated ami 1, ami 2 and ami 3. Deletion mutagenesis in Msm resulted in successful deletion of ami 1 whilst repeated attempts to delete ami 2 did not yield a knockout mutant, suggesting that ami 2 is essential for growth. Deletion of ami 1 results in the formation of long filaments consisting of 3 to 8 cells attached to each other due to incomplete resolution of the septum. In these filaments, lateral growth at both the internal septation sites and extreme poles resulted in irregular cell width, strongly implicating Ami 1 in bacterial cell division, the maintenance of bacterial cell shape and possibly balancing the growth at the cell pole. Since deletion of ami 2 was not possible, a knockdown strain allowing for anhydrotetracycline (ATC) -regulated conditional gene expression of ami 2 was generated. In this system, withdrawal of ATC results in repression of expression. Expression analysis of ami 2 in this strain revealed that whilst significant gene knockdown was achieved, ami 2 expression was not completely abolished in the absence of the inducer ATC, suggesting the presence of basal level ami 2 expression. The repression of ami 2 expression results in retarded growth, diminished motility, unusual colony morphology consisting of miniature colonies lacking any form of serpentine cording and the formation of <b>miniature</b> <b>cells</b> consisting of globular bulges. These data implicate Ami 2 in bacterial growth and maintenance of bacterial cell shape. Collectively, our data comprise the first demonstration of an important role for peptidoglycan degrading amidases in mycobacterial growth and cell division. Furthermore, the phenotypic defects in colony formation due to deletion or depletion of amidases suggest that these enzymes play an important role in cell-cell communication during colony formation. These data validate this class of enzymes as an untapped, legitimate source of novel targets for anti-tubercular drug discovery...|$|E

The biosensor is based on “membrane-engineered” Vero fibroblast cells immobilized in an alginate matrix. The membrane-engineering process involved the electroinsertion of anti-HBV specific antibodies (anti-HBs, anti-HBe) or antigens (HBsAg) in the membranes of the Vero cells. The attachment of a homologous antigen to the electroinserted antibody (or, respectively, of the antibody to the electroinserted antigen) triggered specific changes to the cell membrane potential that were measured by appropriate microelectrodes, according to the principle of the Bioelectric Recognition Assay (BERA). The sensor was used for screening 133 clinical blood serum samples according to a double-blind protocol. Considerably higher sensor responses were observed against HBV-positive samples, compared with responses against negative samples or samples positive for heterologous hepatitis viruses such as Hepatitis C (HCV) virus. Detection of anti-HBs antibodies was made possible by using a biosensor based on immobilized Vero cells bearing the respective antigen (HBsAg). The observed response was rapid (45 sec) and quite reproducible. Fluorescence microscopy observations showed that attachment of HBV particles to cells membrane-engineered with anti-HBs was associated with a decrease of [Ca 2 +]cyt.

The response of leaf area development to this abrupt decrease in nitrate availability was characterized by following {{the expansion of the}} primary and secondary leaf pairs. The timing of the drop in nitrate supply was when cell division in the epidermis of the primary leaf pair was largely complete. Reducing the availability of nitrate had a strong effect on leaf area expansion. The final leaf size of the primary leaf pair was affected indicating an effect of nitrate availability on cell expansion. By the end of the experiment the secondary leaf pair was only one-third the area of that on control seedlings. The role of epidermal cell turgor pressure in this growth response was assessed by direct measurements with a <b>miniature</b> <b>cell</b> pressure probe. No reduction in cell turgor pressure following the decrease in nitrate availability was detected.
