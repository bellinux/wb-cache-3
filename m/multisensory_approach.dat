40|$|The Roman empire afforded a {{kaleidoscope}} of sensations. Through {{a series of}} multisensory case studies centred on people, places, buildings and artefacts, and on specific aspects of human behaviour, this volume develops ground-breaking methods and approaches for sensory studies in Roman archaeology and ancient history. Authors explore questions such as: what it felt like, and symbolised, to be showered with saffron at the amphitheatre; why {{the shape of a}} dancer’s body made him immediately recognisable as a social outcast; how the dramatic gestures, loud noises and unforgettable smells of a funeral would have different meanings for members of the family and for bystanders; and why feeling the weight of a signet ring on his finger contributed to a man’s sense of identity. A <b>multisensory</b> <b>approach</b> is taken throughout, with each chapter exploring {{at least two of the}} senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. The contributors’ individual approaches vary, reflecting the possibilities and the wide application of sensory studies to the ancient world.

40|$|Constructing {{ideas for}} writing is an {{important}} stage in the writing process. If students cannot brainstorm ideas for writing, they cannot start writing. Moreover, writing a composition with rich content demands greatly on students’ ability of making deep observation and experiencing life. How to enhance students’ ability to brainstorm ideas for writing has raised concerns in teaching writing. Previous research indicated that taking in information through all senses is helpful in arousing one’s deep feelings and generating more ideas for writing. Therefore, this study focused on using a <b>multisensory</b> <b>approach</b> in writing to enhance students’ ability in constructing ideas for writing. The researcher guided students to use multiple sensory modalities (sense of sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste) to observe and experience daily life {{in the hope that}} they can describe things and express emotions in writing. This was an action research which aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a <b>multisensory</b> <b>approach</b> in enhancing students’ ability in constructing ideas for writing. A total of nine Form one students from a local band two school participating in the research. This study adopted quantitative methods, including marking pre-test and protest writings and questionnaires, and qualitative methods, including the evaluation of pre-test and pro-test writings and interviews. First, conducted a questionnaire to find out writing difficulties of students. Then, examined the effectiveness of using a <b>multisensory</b> <b>approach</b> in writing by comparing students’ writing performance in the pre-test and pro-test. Finally, conducted a questionnaire and interviews to collect students comments towards using a multi-sensory approach in writing. The results showed that a multi-sensory approach could effectively enhance students’ ability in constructing ideas for writing and descriptive ability. Using a multi-sensory approach in writing helped students take in sensory messages and hence generate ideas for writing. There were improvements of students’ writing performance in pro-test. Students could write more and also describe something at multiple aspects. Findings of questionnaire and interviews indicated a multi-sensory approach could enhance students’ observation awareness and boost their interests and confidence in writing. 寫前構思是寫作思維過程中重要的階段，學生能否動筆寫作，繼續整個寫作思維過程，取決於他們能否根據題目提取寫作素材，產生寫作意念。而且，要寫作一篇意念完整﹑內容豐富具體的文章，學生更需具備仔細觀察及體會生活的能力。故如何提升學生寫作構思的能力，是寫作教學關注的問題。而根據學者的研究，透過不同感官的資訊輸入，能幫助學生積累個人對不同事物的觀感，產生更多的寫作意念，解決題材記取的困難，使寫作內容更豐富充實。因此，本研究將教授學生運用五感觀察法寫作，引導學生運用五感(視覺﹑聽覺﹑嗅覺﹑觸覺﹑味覺) 去體驗周遭的生活事物，把輸入的感官資訊及個人體會作為寫作的素材，細緻﹑具體地描述出來。 本研究為行動研究，旨在探討利用五感觀察教學法提升學生的寫作構思能力的成效。研究共有九位來自第二組別中文中學的中一級學生參與，並以寫作前測﹑後測﹑問卷調查和個人訪談四個方式收集資料，作量化及質性分析。首先以寫作困難問卷調查了解學生的寫作困難，然後以量表評改的方法對寫作前測與後測進行量化及質性的分析，量度出學生寫作表現的變化。最後以學習成效問卷及個人訪談收集學生對五感觀察法提升寫作構思能力﹑描述能力﹑觀察意識﹑寫作興趣與信心的看法，全面探討運用五感觀察教學法寫作的成效。 研究結果顯示，運用五感觀察教學法寫作能提升學生的寫作構思能力及描述能力。學生透過運用五感觀察法，能從不同感官輸入豐富的寫作素材。前﹑彼測的量化及質性分析顯示，學生寫作的篇幅增加了，並能運用感官描寫手法從多角度描寫人﹑事﹑物。另外，問卷及訪談結果顯示，運用五感觀察法寫作亦能提升學生觀察日常事物的意識及寫作的興趣與信心。published_or_final_versionEducationBachelorBachelor of Education in Language Educatio...|$|E

Abstract: This paper discusses work underway {{to explore the}} use of Lego Serious Play (LSP) as an unconventional means of developing student learning. Designed originally as a thinking tool within the corporate sector, the techniques and applications of LSP are not those conventionally used in developing academic capacities within students. However, experiences with LSP at the London College of Fashion and that of users in other settings offer evidence of its value in aligning with other approaches to learning to provide a non-hierarchical and student-centred lens through which to consider personal growth and subject understanding. This paper suggests that LSP has {{an important role to}} play in supporting <b>multisensory</b> <b>approaches</b> to reflecting on learning, either in tandem with, or instead of writing. While the use of LSP discussed here focuses on its implementation on creative arts courses, it is a highly transferable methodology which can be applied across the spectrum of disciplines and for multiple purposes...|$|R

40|$|Eating and {{drinking}} are, perhaps, {{some of the}} most multisensory events of our everyday life. Take, for instance, flavor, {{which is one of the}} most important elements of such experiences. It is known that flavor is the product of the integration of, at least, gustatory and (retronasal) olfactory cues. Nevertheless, researchers have suggested that all our senses can influence the way in which we perceive flavor, not to mention our eating {{and drinking}} experiences. For instance, the color and shape of the food, the background sonic cues in our eating environments, and/or the sounds that derive from the food's mastication can all influence our perception and enjoyment of our eating and drinking experiences. In this workshop, we were particularly interested in new systems that were designed to enhance people's eating experiences in the context of HFI and which were based on the principles that govern the systematic connections that exist between the senses (e. g., spatiotemporal congruence, semantic congruence, and crossmodal correspondences. This included the experiencing food interactions digitally in remote locations, sensing flavor information from one place, transferring them over the internet digitally, and effectively regenerate at the destination. Further, we were interested in digital interfaces that would bring advantages such as precious controlling, cheaper maintenance, avoid refilling, and avoid calories. Therefore, in this workshop we called for studies on flavor sensing and actuation interfaces, new communication mediums, and persisting and retrieving technologies for HFI. Enhancing social interactions to augment the eating experience was another issue we intended addressed in this workshop. In addition, we wanted to discuss what is possible through multimodal technology and what is not possible without it during this workshop. Factors such as measurement techniques (e. g. mastication, eating speed, food tracking, psychophysiological responses to food consumption), potential for interactivity, and potential for customized experiences were taken into consideration. Finally, applications of <b>multisensory</b> <b>approaches</b> to HFI were also encouraged to submit since they can promote healthy eating habits, design of food-related products (e. g. packaging) and more compelling eating experiences...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The <b>Multisensory,</b> Multicognitive <b>Approach</b> (MMA) {{introduced}} {{in this paper}} is premised {{on the belief that}} the seat of language is in the brain prior to its physical manifestation in the form of speech being in the mouth. Hence, in teaching pronunciation, the identity of speech as a cognitive entity prior to being a physical one should be seriously considered in relevant language learning and teaching situations – more so in L 2 situations than in L 1. The traditional assumption that the ideal and the exclusive sensory modality of teaching pronunciation is the auditory modality is no longer acceptable because a holistic view of speech – in production, transmission and perception – manifests itself not only via the auditory sensory modality, but also equally significantly via the visual and tactile-kinesthetic sensory modalities. It is due to this fact that MMA is described as multisensory, a fact that determines the diversified auditory, visual and tactile-kinesthetic implementational techniques needed for effective and efficient teaching of pronunciation especially to adults. Equally importantly, the multicognitive nature of MMA requires the manipulation of diversified cognitive processes in the form of thinking, associating...|$|R
