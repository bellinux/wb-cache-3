40|$|This {{report is}} an {{explanation}} about actuation system design for solar car. The word actuation is almost same with propulsion. This actuation system involved motor, motor controller and transmission system. Actuation system is vital {{in order to}} make sure solar car able to run smoothly when power is supplied. Without proper actuation system design, the power system design that been developed by other person is useless. This system also crucial to ensure safety to driver when driving solar car. Analyses have been done to select suitable electrical device before the devices have been bought. Besides, in this report, <b>motor</b> mounting <b>bracket</b> have been designed and analyzed in software ALGOR. The purpose is to ensure the bracket can withstand vibration of motor and avoid failure. Comparison between AC motor and DC motor are made to compare the torque and power produced. Solar car use simple transmission which is belt drive. Gear ratio analysis is made to ensure correct ratio and car can move with no problem. Then gear ratio analysis is used to consider which torque converter is suitable. This project is successfully completed when every basic part needed for actuation system is analyzed and designed...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{aluminum}} alloy castings for safety critical structural components such as engine mount brackets, steering knuckles, and control arms, offers significant opportunities for achieving weight reduction in automobiles, {{since they are}} typically about half {{the weight of the}} steel, cast iron, or ductile iron component that they replace. Metal Compression Forming (MCF) is a variant of the squeeze casting process, in which molten metal is allowed to solidify under pressure in order to close porosity and form a sound part. However, the MCF process applies pressure on the entire mold face, thereby directing pressure on all regions of the casting and producing a uniformly sound part. The process is capable of producing parts with properties close to those of forgings, while retaining the near net shape, complexity in geometry, and relatively low cost of the casting process. The paper describes the casting process development involved in the production of an aluminum A 357 alloy <b>motor</b> mount <b>bracket,</b> including the use of a filling and solidification model to design the gating and determine process parameters. Tensile properties of the component are presented and correlated with those of forged components. Limited fatigue properties obtained by fully reversed strain controlled testing are also presented...|$|R
5000|$|McKenzie dories are {{specialized}} to run rapids on rivers, {{and first}} appeared on the McKenzie River in Oregon in the mid-20th century. They have a wide flat bottom for low draft, a narrow bow that is flat, often mistaken for the transom, which instead is pointed. The {{reason for this is}} that the rower faces downstream, therefore the part of the boat which first hits the waves (approaching from behind) must be pointed or very narrow to throw the water to the side. The bow is then widened so that a small outboard <b>motor</b> and/or anchor <b>bracket</b> can be attached. Those unfamiliar with the craft would say that they are rowed backwards. McKenzie dories without a transom are called [...] "double-enders".McKenzie River dories are mainly used by recreational boaters who wish to operate a very responsive boat. Like the Rogue River boats described below, the McKenzie River dory provides a much more responsive boating experience than that of a rubber raft. While the McKenzie River dory is a safe watercraft, operating any dory requires keeping river conditions in mind at all times.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As {{the home}} {{appliances}} are systemized, they have complicatedly assembled structure. It {{is reasonable to}} see the noise problem of home appliance {{in the viewpoint of}} system like vehicle and ship. There are various system analysis methods to resolve the noise problem [1 - 3]. To use system analysis methods, the system information like modal and path properties must be gathered and analyzed. But it takes many times to find out the system properties, so the simpler system analysis methods are needed. The coherence analysis method is useful as the system analysis method, since the method can identify the system property like the relationship between inputs and outputs directly and simply. In the paper, the partial coherence analysis is used for identification of the MISO system of washing machine, in which multi-input signals are vibration signals of <b>motor</b> <b>bracket</b> and an output signal is noise signal of washing machine. The relationship between the noise of washing machine and the vibration of the <b>motor</b> <b>bracket</b> in working status was identified and the parts of bracket closely correlated with noise were also proved by the relationship. And the noise of washing machine was controlled by redesigning the parts of bracket associated with the noise of washing machine based on the coherence function in octave band...|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} the {{frequency}} spectral maps, the frequency spectra are mainly concentrated in the low- and medium-frequency responses below 100  Hz. This result is consistent with that in other studies [21 – 23]. The frequency spectrum of the <b>motor</b> <b>bracket</b> load is concentrated at 20 and 60 HZ. The frequency spectrum of the gearbox bracket load is concentrated below 10  Hz. The torsion load spectrum is concentrated below 10  Hz. The frequency spectrum of the stress response is concentrated at 20 and 60  Hz. Accordingly, a 100  Hz low-pass filter and a 50  Hz band-pass filter are adopted to remove some random disturbances and power-frequency interferences.|$|E
40|$|Aluminium foam can be {{manufactured}} applying {{a variety of}} methods including direct foaming of aluminium alloy melts and advanced metal powder processing. Complex shaped foam components and 3 D shaped sandwich panels consisting of foam cores and alumium face sheets can be produced. The application potential of these materials is discussed for various fields, namely light weight construction, crash energy absorption and thermal or sound insulation. Four case studies are presented a lifting arm for a lorry, a crash box for a car, an impact energy absorber for a tram and a <b>motor</b> <b>bracket</b> for a car. Such studies allow us to assess in which application fields aluminium forms perform well and in which direction future development should be directe...|$|E
5000|$|In 1950 Mercury {{engineers}} {{came out}} with the Super 10 Hurricane, Model KG-7. This motor was based on previous models KE-7 Lightning and KF-7 Super 10. Upgrades included redesigned connecting rods, upgraded aluminum clamp and swivel brackets, a new high RPM magneto, improved porting, an 8 Reed valve cage (as opposed to KE-7 and KF-7’s 4) and larger crankcase opening. Hurricane was also advertised at 10 hp*, way below the actual horsepower developed, Mercury noted this asterisk by stating that horsepower varies with rpm; really the Hurricane could deliver up to 18 hp. Shortly after the introduction of the Hurricane, Mercury came up with their first performance gear case with the capability of mating to a standard driveshaft housing of a KG-7 or similar green top engine of the time. This was named “Quicksilver” and promised an extra 20 to 30% increase in top speed. Essentially, it boasted a significantly slimmer pointed gear case that housed an integrated rubber rotex water pump and forward only 1:1 gears along with the necessary bearings. After a few months of use, Mercury found that the average race boat's transom would not elevate the standard driveshaft housing and quicksilver gear case high enough for peak performance. Rectifying this problem, Mercury developed the Quicksilver driveshaft housing. This new driveshaft housing was three inches shorter which in turn lowered the motor's center of gravity on the boat which helped turning ability, reduced the strain on the boat's transom and <b>motor's</b> clamp <b>brackets,</b> and decreased underwater drag while increasing top speed as less gearcase was below the boat. In addition the motor had a sort-of cut down lower anti-cavitation plate, protruding forward upper anti-cavitation plate (spray plate), a stronger rear-mounted steering bar design, and finally, an exhaust opening above the water surface that reduced exhaust back pressure while increasing noise levels when the boat was on plane. When the dealer installed the quicksilver driveshaft housing and gear case (packaged at $82.25) he had authorization to hand stamp a small [...] "Q" [...] behind the serial numbers on the tag and block. Some did, some did not - and so, the [...] "Stamped Q" [...] came to be. 1951 saw the first production race-ready outboard models; KG-4Q, KG7-Q, and KG-9Q. These motors were pulled off the production line at random, given the quicksilver gear case, driveshaft housing, and [...] "Q" [...] stamp behind the tag serial number and block serial number. These KG-7Qs worked fine on runabouts but were too long for hydroplanes - and the racers made this known to Mercury. So thus was born the 2" [...] shorter [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing in 1952. Right before Mercury released this [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing, they still had several [...] "Q" [...] length driveshaft housings, so they introduced a factory KG-7Q which had a green silk screened Q behind the serial number on the tag and a factory stamped [...] "Q" [...] on the block. These motors are very rare; they fall into the serial range of 532404-532963.|$|R
30|$|The laboratory-calibrated load-stress {{transitive}} relation {{differs from the}} real load-stress {{transitive relation}}. This difference {{is caused by the}} difference between the constraints on the road and those on the laboratory bench, even if the laboratory bench installs the bogie, including spring, axle box, rod, anti-yaw bracket, and other related accessories, according to actual operating conditions. The most significant influencing factors are rigidity matching and gap issues. Different constraint stiffness values and contact gaps in the same direction may offset or increase the stress caused by different loads. Another cause for such a difference is the effect of the changing wheel-rail contact point on the arm of force. Therefore, from a statistical perspective, the optimized load-stress transitive relation is more reasonable than that calibrated by laboratory bench. The stress calculated by the optimized transfer coefficient still exhibits a certain degree of deviation from the measured signal. Such deviation is mainly caused by partial loads. For example, primary vertical damper loads and secondary horizontal damper loads are not measured in this test. Another reason is that elastic vibration phenomenon exists in the local structure (e.g., <b>motor</b> <b>bracket).</b> Overall, load and stress exhibit a linear relationship under the operating conditions.|$|E
