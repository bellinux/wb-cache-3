5|$|In July 1997 an eight-man SASR team {{deployed}} at {{short notice}} to Butterworth in Malaysia to provide close protection and communications to the Australian ambassador and embassy staff in Cambodia if required, {{in preparation for the}} evacuation of Australian nationals in the wake of civil unrest which occurred following a coup in that country. The evacuation operation was subsequently completed successfully, with RAAF C-130s supported by Airfield Defence Guards and other military personnel evacuating 455 Australians and other nationals from Cambodia as part of Operation Vista. Later, following the agreement of a truce in October 1997 which ended the conflict in Bougainville, Australian personnel were deployed as part of the New Zealand-led Truce <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Group,</b> with an SASR officer being included in the reconnaissance party and later serving on its headquarters. In April 1998, Australia took over leadership of the mission, which was renamed the Peace <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Group.</b> Numerous SASR personnel served in Bougainville over a four-year period as part of Operation Bel Isi, both in headquarters positions and as part of the monitoring teams.|$|E
5|$|The {{intervention}} in May 2000 {{was the first}} major deployment of British forces to Sierra Leone during the civil war, but {{was not the first time}} British personnel had served there. In May 1997, a two-man training team from the British Army was sent to train SLA officers but discovered that the SLA's strength was much lower than it had reported. The government was overthrown in a coup before any training could take place. Following the restoration of the elected government by the Economic Community of West African States <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Group</b> (ECOMOG) in February 1998, HMS Cornwall sailed to Freetown with food and medical supplies. Her crew assisted with infrastructure repairs and her helicopter was used to move people and supplies around Sierra Leone until she left in mid-April. As the security situation in Sierra Leone deteriorated later in the year, the Royal Air Force (RAF) conducted a non-combatant evacuation operation under the codename Operation Spartic over Christmas 1998. Approximately 80 people—predominantly British citizens, many of them staff or dependants from the British High Commission—were evacuated over two days.|$|E

5|$|The six SNA brigades around Mogadishu were as of July 2013 largely {{composed}} of officers from various Hawiye sub-clans, with some Marehan-Darod and minorities {{also present in}} certain units. Of the brigades, five primarily consisted of Abgaal, Murosade and Hawadle soldiers. In February 2013 the 2nd Brigade was {{under the command of}} Brigadier General Abdullahi Osman Agey. The 3rd Brigade over the same period comprised 840 fighters, most of whom belong to the Hawiye-Habar Gidir/Ayr clan. The unit was around 30% to 50% smaller in size than the other five brigades that are garrisoned in the larger Banaadir region. Led by General Mohamed Roble Jimale 'Gobale', it occupied an area outside of Mogadishu and Merka and along the Afgoye corridor. The <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Group</b> reported that many 3rd Brigade fighters had been drawn from around 300-strong militias controlled by Yusuf Mohamed Siyaad 'Indha Adde', a close associate of Jimale and the former Eritrean-backed chief of defence for the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia-Asmara. However, Siyaad was by then no longer part of the SNA's official military structures.|$|E

25|$|Tobruk {{played an}} {{important}} role in efforts to end the civil war in Bougainville during the 1990s. In September 1994, she transported an Australian peacekeeping force to Bougainville to protect peace talks which were attempting to end the civil war on the island. These talks were not successful and during the deployment one of the ship's Sea King helicopters was damaged by small arms fire; the first damage sustained by a RAN unit since the Vietnam War. A peace agreement was signed in October 1997, and Tobruk returned to Bougainville in November of that year to deploy a peace <b>monitoring</b> <b>group.</b> The ship made several voyages to the island during the first four months of 1998 to support the peace process. Further voyages to Bougainville took place in September 1998, February 2000 and August 2003; the last of these was to extract the peace <b>monitoring</b> <b>group</b> following the successful conclusion of this mission. Tobruk also participated in a major international exercise in South East Asia in 1999.|$|E

25|$|The {{impetus for}} peace was the {{election}} of Prime Minister Bill Skate, who had previously opposed a military solution. In mid-1997, talks were held in Honiara and Burnham in New Zealand resulting in a truce, as well as agreement to de-militarize the island. An unarmed Truce <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Group</b> (TMG) led by New Zealand and supported by Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu was subsequently deployed. Since then a ceasefire has largely held on the island. Breaking with Ona, Kauona and Kabui entered into peace talks with the Skate government in Christchurch, New Zealand, which culminated in {{the signing of the}} Lincoln Agreement in January 1998. Under the terms of the agreement, PNG began to withdraw its soldiers from the island, and steps were taken to disarm the BRA and BRF, while a multinational Peace <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Group</b> (PMG) under Australian leadership was deployed, replacing the TMG. Legislation to establish a Bougainville Reconciliation Government failed to win approval in the PNG Parliament in December 1998.|$|E

40|$|Long term {{water quality}} <b>monitoring</b> by citizen <b>groups</b> has {{produced}} large data sets, often {{with little or}} no capacity for data analysis beyond basic quality control. It is often beyond the capability of citizen <b>monitoring</b> <b>groups</b> to analyze large sets of water quality data by available data analysis methods, and discern the biological importance of the results within naturally variable systems. To assist citizen <b>monitoring</b> <b>groups</b> with the evaluation of water quality data in their watershed, a new method of analysis was developed and subsequently validated. The method developed, Quantitative Percent Exceedence (QPE), was based on biologically important thresholds, and designed to be carried out by citizen <b>monitoring</b> <b>groups</b> with a basic software package (Microsoft Excel). Sites were categorized by exceedence from the standard using QPE, and compared to clusters obtained from hierarchical cluster analysis. The correlation between these categorizations was verified by X 2 analysis. Categorizations obtained from hierarchical cluster analysis (HCE) were well correlated with those from QPE (p < 0. 001). QPE is an effective method for the categorization of sites based on biologically meaningful data that citizen <b>monitoring</b> <b>groups</b> can use to inform monitoring and remediation efforts in their watersheds, producing results that are statistically comparable to the accepted method of hierarchical cluster analysis.
