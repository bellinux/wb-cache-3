The Davis case, {{the only}} {{case of the}} five {{originating}} from a student protest, began when 16-year-old Barbara Rose Johns organized and led a 450-student walkout of <b>Moton</b> High School. The Gebhart case {{was the only one}} where a trial court, affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court, found that discrimination was unlawful; in all the other cases the plaintiffs had lost as the original courts had found discrimination to be lawful.|$|E
5|$|The PTI3A Stearman was {{the first}} type of {{training}} plane {{to be used in}} teaching the new recruits. The AT6 Texan, and P-40 Warhawk followed as the aircraft of choice over time. Much of the primary flight training was done at <b>Moton</b> Field at Tuskegee. Tuskegee trained over 1,000 black aviators during the war, about half of whom served overseas.|$|E
5|$|A stone coffin {{found during}} the 2012 {{excavation}} was opened {{for the first}} time, revealing a lead coffin inside. An investigation with an endoscope revealed {{the presence of a}} skeleton along with some head hair and fragments of a shroud and cord. The skeleton was at first assumed to be male, perhaps that of a knight called Sir William de <b>Moton</b> who was known to have been buried there, but later examination showed it to be of a woman—perhaps a high-ranking benefactress. She may not necessarily have been local, as lead coffins were used to transport corpses over long distances.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>Moton</b> {{was covered}} with blood, the bullets had missed him. He lay {{motionless}} when the Klansmen reached the car to check on their victims. After the Klansmen left, <b>Moton</b> began searching for help, and eventually flagged down a truck driven by Rev. Leon Riley. Rev Riley was, like <b>Moton</b> and Liuzzo, shuttling civil rights workers back to Selma.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of African-Americans during the disaster endangered Hoover's {{reputation as a}} humanitarian. Local officials brutalized black farmers and prevented them from leaving relief camps, aid intended for African-American sharecroppers was often given instead to the landowners, and black men often were conscripted by locals into forced labor, sometimes at gun point. Knowing the potential damage to his presidential hopes if this became public, Hoover {{struck a deal with}} Robert Russa <b>Moton,</b> the prominent African-American successor to Booker T. Washington as president of the Tuskegee Institute. In exchange for keeping the sufferings of African-Americans quiet, Hoover promised unprecedented influence for African-Americans should he become president. <b>Moton</b> agreed, and following the accommodationist philosophy of Washington, he worked actively to conceal the information from the media.|$|E
25|$|The 322d EOG forms part of {{the lineage}} of the World War II 332d Fighter Group, known as the Tuskegee Airmen. This title refers to all who trained in the Army Air Forces African-American pilot {{training}} program at <b>Moton</b> Field and Tuskegee Army Airfield, Alabama, between 1941 and 1945. It includes pilots, navigators, bombardiers, maintenance and support staff, instructors, and personnel who kept aircraft flying.|$|E
25|$|The command also {{operated}} several specialized {{schools at}} Jackson, Tuskegee, Spence and Clewiston. Jackson Army Air Base {{was the home}} of the Royal Netherlands Flight Academy, which trained pilots for their air force. It also hadd a two-engine school for B-25 Mitchell medium bomber training for Dutch pilots. Riddle Field at Clewiston, Florida was a contract pilot school which taught both primary and basic flight training. Tuskegee Field, Alabama was exclusively for black air cadets, who received their basic and single-engine advanced training by black Army instructors after graduating from the primary school at <b>Moton</b> Field, operated by the Tuskegee Institute.|$|E
25|$|Several African American {{health workers}} and {{educators}} associated with Tuskegee Institute helped the PHS {{to carry out}} its experimentation and {{played a critical role in}} the progress of the study. The extent to which they knew about the full scope of the study is not clear in all cases. Dr. Robert Russa <b>Moton,</b> then president of Tuskegee Institute, and Dr. Eugene Dibble, head of the Institute's John Andrews Hospital, both lent their endorsement and institutional resources to the government study. Registered Nurse Eunice Rivers, who had trained at Tuskegee Institute and worked at its affiliated John Andrew Hospital, was recruited at the start of the study to be the main contact with the participants in the study.|$|E
25|$|The 332d Fighter Group was {{constituted}} on 4 July 1942, and activated on 13 October, predominantly manned with African-American personnel. Consisted of the 100th, 301st and 302d Fighter Squadrons at Tuskegee Army Air Field, Alabama. Trained with P-39 Airacobra and P-40 Warhawk aircraft for {{an extended}} period of time as the Army Air Forces was reluctant to deploy African-American fighter pilots to an overseas combat theater. The 100th Fighter Squadron pre-dates the 332d Fighter Group, being formed on 19 February 1942. The 100th carried out advanced fighter training of graduates of the Tuskegee Institute primary and basic flight training programs for African-American flight cadets at nearby <b>Moton</b> Field. The first class (42-C) of twelve cadets included student officer Captain Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., who served as Commandant of Cadets, began training on 19 July 1941.|$|E
500|$|Sheep {{meat and}} milk {{were one of}} the {{earliest}} staple proteins consumed by human civilization after the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture. [...] Sheep meat prepared for food is known as either mutton or lamb. [...] "Mutton" [...] is derived from the Old French <b>moton,</b> which was the word for sheep used by the Anglo-Norman rulers of much of the British Isles in the Middle Ages. This became the name for sheep meat in English, while the Old English word sceap was kept for the live animal. Throughout modern history, [...] "mutton" [...] has been limited to the meat of mature sheep usually at least two years of age; [...] "lamb" [...] is used for that of immature sheep less than a year.|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt {{supported}} increased {{roles for}} women and African-Americans in the war effort, and began to advocate for women to be given factory jobs a year before it became a widespread practice. In 1942, she urged women of all social backgrounds to learn trades, saying: [...] "if I were of a debutante age I would go into a factory–any factory where I could learn a skill and be useful." [...] Roosevelt learned of {{the high rate of}} absenteeism among working mothers, and she campaigned for government-sponsored day care. She notably supported the Tuskegee Airmen in their successful effort to become the first black combat pilots, visiting the Tuskegee Air Corps Advanced Flying School in Alabama. She also flew with African-American chief civilian instructor C. Alfred [...] "Chief" [...] Anderson. Anderson had been flying since 1929 and was responsible for training thousands of rookie pilots; he took her on a half-hour flight in a Piper J-3 Cub. After landing, she cheerfully announced, [...] "Well, you can fly all right." [...] The subsequent brouhaha over the First Lady's flight had such an impact it is often mistakenly cited as the start of the Civilian Pilot Training Program at Tuskegee, even though the program was already five months old. Eleanor Roosevelt did use her position as a trustee of the Julius Rosenwald Fund to arrange a loan of $175,000 to help finance the building of <b>Moton</b> Field.|$|E

As they were getting gas at a local filling station, they were subject to abusive calls and racist scorn. When Liuzzo stopped at a red light, a car with four white men pulled up alongside her {{who were members of}} the local Ku Klux Klan. When they saw a white woman and a black man in a car together, they followed Liuzzo as she tried to outrun them.

60|$|And there arose vivats within {{doors and}} without; 'escort of three,' amid shoutings and embracings: thus Jourgniac escaped from jury-trial and {{the jaws of}} death.

Maton and Sicard did, either by trial, and no bill found, lank President Chepy finding 'absolutely nothing;' or else by evasion, and new favour of <b>Moton</b> the brave watchmaker, {{likewise}} escape; and were embraced, and wept over; weeping in return, as they well might.|$|E
6000|$|The tocsin is pealing its loudest, {{the clocks}} inaudibly {{striking}} Three, when poor Abbe Sicard, with some thirty other Nonjurant Priests, in six carriages, fare along the streets, from their preliminary House of Detention at the Townhall, westward towards the Prison of the Abbaye. Carriages enough stand deserted on the streets; these six move on,--through angry multitudes, cursing as they move. Accursed Aristocrat Tartuffes, {{this is the}} pass ye have brought us to! And now ye will break the Prisons, and set Capet Veto on horseback to ride over us? Out upon you, Priests of Beelzebub and Moloch; of Tartuffery, Mammon, and the Prussian Gallows,--which ye name Mother-Church and God! Such reproaches have the poor Nonjurants to endure, and worse; spoken in on them by frantic Patriots, who mount even on the carriage-steps; the very Guards hardly refraining. Pull up your carriage-blinds!--No! answers Patriotism, clapping its horny paw on the carriage blind, and crushing it down again. Patience in oppression has limits: we are close on the Abbaye, it has lasted long: a poor Nonjurant, of quicker temper, smites the horny paw with his cane; nay, finding solacement in it, smites the unkempt head, sharply and again more sharply, twice over,--seen clearly of us and of the world. It is the last that we see clearly. Alas, next moment, the carriages are locked and blocked in endless raging tumults; in yells deaf to the cry for mercy, which answer the cry for mercy with sabre-thrusts through the heart.

50|$|Motivated by Hoover's promises, <b>Moton</b> {{saw to it}} {{that the}} Colored Advisory Commission never {{revealed}} {{the full extent of the}} abuses in the Delta, and <b>Moton</b> championed Hoover's candidacy to the African American population. However, once elected President in 1928, Hoover ignored Robert <b>Moton</b> and the promises he had made to his black constituency. In the following election of 1932, <b>Moton</b> withdrew his support for Hoover and switched to the Democratic Party.|$|E

5000|$|During World War I, <b>Moton</b> {{traveled}} to Europe {{on behalf of}} president Woodrow Wilson. His duty {{was to investigate the}} condition of the African American soldiers. He often witnessed discriminatory practices. For example, during his investigation, <b>Moton</b> was confronted by an American general regarding twenty-six alleged cases of rape by black soldiers. The general told <b>Moton</b> that black soldiers were dangerous to themselves and women. <b>Moton</b> challenged these allegations, suggesting discrimination was motivating factor, and encouraged black soldiers to protest against segregation when they returned to the US.|$|E
50|$|He married Elizabeth Hunt Harris in 1905, but {{she died}} in 1906. He married his second wife, Jennie Dee Booth, in 1908.

Johnson; Catherine <b>Moton</b> (Patterson); and Jennie <b>Moton</b> (Taylor). All three married and had families.|$|E
50|$|The {{commission}} {{conducted a}} thorough investigation and reported back to <b>Moton</b> on the deplorable conditions. <b>Moton</b> presented the findings to Hoover, and advocated immediate improvements to aid the flood's neediest victims.

In return, Hoover implied {{that if he were}} successful in his bid for the presidency, <b>Moton</b> and his people would play a role in his administration unprecedented in the nation's history. Hoover also hinted that as president he intended to divide the land of bankrupt planters into small African American-owned farms.|$|E
50|$|Today the <b>Moton</b> School {{stands as}} a {{reminder}} of the struggle for Civil Rights in Education.
