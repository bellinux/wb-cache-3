25|$|In 2008, Bedier founded United Voices for America (UVA), a non-profit, non-partisan civic {{organization}} dedicated to increasing <b>minority</b> <b>participation</b> in America’s political process. One of the first efforts of the new organization was the organization of candidate and issue forums. These large public events brought minority constituents into contact with candidates during the 2008 election year. These forums provided a venue where issues could be identified first hand and voters could reach informed decisions regarding the candidates. Organizing issue forums where elected officials and decision makers can discuss concerns remains an important strategy of United Voices.|$|E

Residents and activist groups in Fayette County, Georgia sued the board of commissioners and school board for maintaining an election system based on at-large voting, which tended to increase {{the power of the}} majority and effectively prevented <b>minority</b> <b>participation</b> on elected local boards for nearly 200 years. A change to single-member districts has resulted in the African-American minority being able to elect representatives of its choice.|$|E

500|$|Eve {{was elected}} to the New York State Assembly in 1966 {{following}} several years of service as an independent ward leader in Buffalo.

Eve rose to prominence in the mid-1960s during Buffalo's civil disturbances and rights. He expanded his notability during the Attica Prison riots. During the Buffalo riot of 1967, Eve attempted to organize formal meetings in order to avert physical confrontations. Eve fought against union policies which disallowed <b>minority</b> <b>participation</b> in apprentice programs that led to high paying union jobs on state construction sites. [...] He threatened New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller that he would lie down in front of bulldozers at one of these sites. In 1968, he delayed construction on the State University of New York at Buffalo's Amherst Campus to push through an agreement that New York State and the unions would promote minority access into the construction industry. [...] The protests by supporters of Eve's effort caused Rockefeller to call for an eleven-month construction moratorium starting in March 1969.|$|E

40|$|Black and Hispanic {{high school}} {{students}} enroll in Advanced Placement (AP) courses at approximately half the rate of white students.

In addition, minority students enroll in AP math, science, and English at lower rates than comparable white students. Magnet schools promote AP participation among white students but reduce participation among college-bound black students. Race-matched role models promote AP-taking among high-achieving black males, and AP incentive programs have the potential to dramati-cally increase <b>minority</b> student <b>participation.</b> Policy implications include reducing the impersonal nature of large high schools by creating smaller “schools-within-a-school ” while maintaining flexibility across academic tracks, eliminating magnet programs, hiring qualified AP teachers to actively mentor minority students, and implementing incentive pro-grams that promote teacher training and provide incentives for student achievement...|$|R

However, in 1977 the NP caucus {{approved}} proposals to bring Coloureds and Indians into central government. In 1982, final constitutional proposals produced a referendum among Whites, and the Tricameral Parliament was approved. The Constitution was reformed the following year to allow the Coloured and Asian <b>minorities</b> <b>participation</b> in separate Houses in a Tricameral Parliament, and Botha became the first Executive State President. The idea was that the Coloured minority could be granted voting rights, but the Black majority were to become citizens of independent homelands. These separate arrangements continued until the abolition of apartheid. The Tricameral reforms led to the formation of the (anti-apartheid) United Democratic Front as a vehicle to try to prevent the co-option of Coloureds and Indians into an alliance with Whites. The battles between the UDF and the NP government from 1983 to 1989 were to become the most intense period of struggle between left-wing and right-wing South Africans.|$|R
