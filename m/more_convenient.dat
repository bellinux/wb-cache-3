5|$|Meanwhile, Norwich {{railway station}} had opened in 1844. Although many Norwich {{residents}} {{were reluctant to}} use the railway, and goods carriers initially found it <b>more</b> <b>convenient</b> to continue to collect goods from the coaching inns, as railway usage gradually {{increased the number of}} coaches and carts calling at the inns slowly dwindled, reducing congestion. In 1899 the Angel inn—renamed the Royal Hotel in 1840 on the occasion of Queen Victoria's wedding—finally closed, and was replaced with George Skipper's Royal Arcade, a shopping centre in the Art Nouveau style.|$|E

5|$|The three-cent nickel piece {{initially}} circulated well, {{but became}} less popular when the five-cent nickel {{was introduced in}} 1866, a larger, <b>more</b> <b>convenient</b> coin, with a value of five cents better fitting the decimal system. After 1870, most years saw low annual mintages for the three-cent nickel, and in 1890 Congress abolished it. The last were struck in 1889; many were melted down to coin more five-cent pieces. The issue is not widely collected, and prices for rare dates remain low {{by the standards of}} American collectible coinage.|$|E
5|$|The three-cent nickel {{piece was}} very popular when it entered {{circulation}} in mid-1865. <b>More</b> <b>convenient</b> than the larger two-cent bronze piece, it largely replaced that coin, starting the two-cent {{on its way}} to decreased popularity and abolition in 1873. The hard alloy, though, caused high levels of die breakage. Between 1865 and 1876, some 17 million three-cent pieces were used by the government to redeem the three-cent fractional currency notes.|$|E
5|$|Thin {{sectioning}} was {{an early}} procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. The process required cutting a coal ball with a diamond saw, then flattening and polishing the thin section with an abrasive.

Although the process could be done with a machine, {{the large amount of}} time needed and the poor quality of samples produced by thin sectioning gave way to a <b>more</b> <b>convenient</b> method.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, demand for pennies was falling in Britain, {{likely due to}} the {{popularity}} of the lighter, <b>more</b> <b>convenient,</b> brass threepence coin. which weighed {{less than a quarter of}} the same value in bronze coins. The immediate aftermath of the war had seen a strong demand for pennies until January 1949, when it dropped off, and in May of that year, the Royal Mint stopped the coin's production. Officials concluded that the fall in demand was permanent due to inflation; its purchasing power was minimal, and many automatic machines no longer took it. The Royal Mint redeemed surplus coppers from the banks for melting beginning in 1951, and by the end of the decade, some £1.2 million worth had been removed from circulation.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s, Brazil {{exported}} 11,000tons of cacao and by 1880 {{this had}} increased to 73,500tons.

Until 1850, rubber production was insignificant, but between 1881 and 1890, it had reached third place among Brazilian exports. This was about 81tons between 1827 and 1830 reaching 1,632tons in 1852. By 1900 {{the country was}} exporting 24,301,452tons of rubber. Brazil also exported around 3,377,000tons of coffee between 1821 and 1860 while between 1861 and 1889 this reached 6,804,000tons.

5|$|Italy's {{position}} in {{the centre of the}} Mediterranean made it unacceptably hazardous to send ships from Britain to Egypt via that route, so British reinforcements and supplies for the area had to travel around the Cape of Good Hope. For this reason, it was <b>more</b> <b>convenient</b> to reinforce General Sir Archibald Wavell's Middle East Command with troops from Australia, New Zealand and India. Nonetheless, even when Britain was threatened with invasion after the Battle of France and equipment was urgently required to re-equip the British Expeditionary Force after its losses in the Dunkirk evacuation, troops and supplies were still despatched to the Middle East Command. A convoy that departed the United Kingdom in August 1940 brought guns, stores, ammunition, and three armoured regiments, including the 7th Royal Tank Regiment, equipped with Matilda II tanks.|$|E

5|$|Significant change {{occurred}} when the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894.

The Weston Canal has been little used since. Although {{it is possible for}} pleasure craft to reach the Weaver from the Ship Canal, it is a commercial waterway, and most leisure users are dissuaded from doing so by the amount of paperwork and the requirements of the operating company.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightness}} of a star, {{as seen from}} Earth, is measured with a standardized, logarithmic scale. This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing {{brightness of}} the star. The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest, Sirius, is of magnitude −1.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega {{was used as a}} baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales. However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux. This approach is <b>more</b> <b>convenient</b> for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} the First World War {{dramatically}} shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed {{in the air as}} much as on the ground: military pilots found them <b>more</b> <b>convenient</b> than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had.

5|$|The main {{advantage}} of composite bows over self bows (made {{from a single}} piece of wood) is their combination of smaller size with high power.
