The objectives {{of this study}} were to assess the adherence level to antihypertensive treatment and to identify its associated factors in a sample of hypertensive patients in Lebanon and Jordan. Methods: We conducted an observational study between May 2011 and September 2012. A total of 1, 470 eligible hypertensive patients were enrolled in our study and followed up for a period of 6 months. Data were collected regarding sociodemographic, health behavior, and hypertension-related characteristics. The {{adherence to}} treatment and the quality of life were self-reported using the <b>Morisky,</b> <b>Green</b> & Levine Scale and the Hypertension Quality of Life Questionnaire. Results: Our results revealed that 55. 9 % of the patients were adherent to their antihypertensive medication. Older age was associated with better adherence, whereas being divorced or widowed, having a poorer quality of life, and being classified as having stage 1 or 2 hypertension {{at the end of the}} study were all associated with poorer adherence. Conclusion: Efforts should be exerted on all levels in order to increase the adherence to antihypertensive treatment through the implementation of educational campaigns.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} {{factors that}} can affect compliance to treatment with neoplastic oral drugs {{in a group of}} cancer patients. METHODS: Interviews were performed on 61 patients diagnosed with cancer and under anti-neoplastic oral therapy in a private hospital. The interviews were carried out using instruments to assess compliance. RESULTS: Most patients (95 %) reported the oral treatment was not difficult. The <b>Morisky</b> and <b>Green</b> Test were positive in 28 % of the patients. Factors that may affect following the treatment were significantly (p< 0. 05) associated with the time variable; patients who presented more difficulty had more treatment time.

The secondary aim was to analyze the impact of suboptimal adherence on clinical and functional outcomes. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of outpatients receiving an oral antipsychotic drug. Medication adherence was assessed combining the 10 -item Drug Attitude Inventory, the <b>Morisky</b> <b>Green</b> Adherence Questionnaire, and the Compliance Rating Scale. Logistic regression was used to determine significant variables associated with suboptimal adherence to medication. Results: Three hundred and three patients were enrolled into the study. The mean age was 45. 9 &plusmn; 12. 8 years, and 59. 7 % were females. Sixty-nine percent of patients showed suboptimal adherence. Disease severity and functioning were significantly worse in the suboptimal group than in the adherent group. Multivariate analysis showed depressive polarity of the last acute episode, presence of subsyndromal symptoms, and substance abuse/dependence to be significantly associated with suboptimal treatment adherence (odds ratios 3. 41, 2. 13, and 1. 95, respectively). Conclusion: A high prevalence of nonadherence was found in an outpatient sample with bipolar disorder. Identification of factors related to treatment adherence would give clinicians the opportunity to select more adequately patients who are eligible for potential adherence-focused interventions.

40|$|Background: COPD, a progressive, partly {{reversible}} {{condition with}} airflow limitation particularly warrants {{the inclusion of}} pharmacists in the healthcare team. Extreme physician scarcity severely limits the implementation of quality healthcare in India. Pharmacist-led educational intervention achieves smoking cessation and improves medication adherence. Objective: This study evaluated {{the effectiveness of a}} clinical pharmacist-led intervention on medication adherence in COPD patients in a teaching hospital. Methods: In an open-labelled randomized controlled study at Kasturba Medical College Hospital, Manipal, India, patients were randomly assigned to two groups (Intervention group [IG] and Control group [CG]), and were matched for socio-demographics and clinical characteristics. Medication adherence was assessed by the <b>Morisky,</b> <b>Green</b> and Levine Medication Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ). In IG, pharmacist intervention placed emphasis on (1) compliance, (2) smoking cessation, (3) exercise, (4) inhaler use and (5) need for timely follow up. The MAQ assessment was repeated at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Data were analysed statistically by SPSS version 20. 0. Results: Out of 328 patients screened during March 2012 to June 2013, 260 were recruited. Of these, 206 completed the follow-up (98 in CG and 104 in IG). Medication adherence improved significantly after pharmacist intervention in IG at all follow-up time points (P< 0. 001). It increased from 49 % at the baseline to 80 % after 24 months (P< 0. 001). Carelessness about taking medicines {{was one of the main}} reasons for non-adherence in COPD patients, but was effectively reduced by the intervention. Conclusions: This is the first randomized controlled trial in India that demonstrates the pivotal role of pharmacist-led educational intervention in improving medication adherence in COPD. Involving non-physician health professionals could be the best strategy, for resource-poor nations like India, because the current physician-centric healthcare has no emphasis on patient education and counseling...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} pharmacological treatment adherence of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, attended in an outpatient pharmacy at a tertiary hospital in northeastern Brazil. MethodsThe analysis of adherence was performed along with caregivers, through a structured questionnaire based on <b>Morisky,</b> <b>Green</b> and Levine, which enabled the categorization of adherence in “highest”, “moderate” or “low” grades, and through evaluating medication dispensing registers, which classified the act of getting medications at the pharmacy as “regular” or “irregular”. Drug Related Problems (DRP) were identified through the narrative of caregivers and classified according to the Second Granada Consensus. Then, a pharmaceutical orientation chart with information about the therapeutic regimen was applied, in order to function as a guide for issues that influenced adherence. ResultsA total of 43 patients was included, with a mean age of 11. 12 years, and 65. 1 % (n= 28) were female. Applying the questionnaire, it was found “highest” adherence in 46. 5 % (n= 20) patients, “moderate” adherence in 48. 8 % (n= 21), and “low” adherence in 4. 7 % (n= 2). Through an analysis of the medication dispensing registers, a lower level of adherence was observed: only 25. 6 % (n= 11) of the participants received “regularly” the medications. Twenty-six DRP was identified, and 84. 6 % (n= 22) were classified as real. There were no significant associations between socio-demographic variables and adherence, although some caregivers have reported difficulty in accessing the medicines and in understanding the treatment.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{integrated}} {{treatment of}} first episode psychosis {{has been shown}} to improve functionality and negative symptoms in previous studies. In this paper, we describe a study of integrated treatment (individual psychoeducation complementary to pharmacotherapy) versus treatment as usual, comparing results at baseline with those at 6 -month re-assessment (at the end of the study) for these patients, and online training of professionals to provide this complementary treatment, with the following objectives: 1) to compare the efficacy of individual psychoeducation as add-on treatment versus treatment as usual in improving psychotic and mood symptoms; 2) to compare adherence to medication, functioning, insight, social response, quality of life, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, between both groups; and 3) to analyse the efficacy of online training of psychotherapists. Methods/designThis is a single-blind randomised clinical trial including patients with first episode psychosis from hospitals across Spain, randomly assigned to either a control group with pharmacotherapy and regular sessions with their psychiatrist (treatment as usual) or an intervention group with integrated care including treatment as usual plus a psychoeducational intervention (14 sessions). Training for professionals involved at each participating centre was provided by the coordinating centre (University Hospital of Álava) through video conferences. Patients are evaluated with an extensive battery of tests assessing clinical and sociodemographic characteristics (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorders, Strauss and Carpenter Prognostic Scale, Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, <b>Morisky</b> <b>Green</b> Adherence Scale, Functioning Assessment Short Test, World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument WHOQOL-BREF (an abbreviated version of the WHOQOL- 100), and EuroQoL questionnaire), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels are measured in peripheral blood at baseline and at 6 months. The statistical analysis, including bivariate analysis, linear and logistic regression models, will be performed using SPSS. DiscussionThis is an innovative study that includes the assessment of an integrated intervention for patients with first episode psychosis provided by professionals who are trained online, potentially making it possible to offer the intervention to more patients.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze {{adherence}} to drug treatment in hypertensive patients enrolled on the Family Health Program in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo State. This transversal study was conducted between August and December 2006, in which 109 patients were interviewed using the <b>Morisky</b> and <b>Green</b> Test to measure adherence level to pharmacotherapy. Variables that may be related to adherence level were also investigated, such as demographic characteristics, health care team and health service related factors, and pharmacotherapy related factors. The test scores were analyzed by two criteria: patients were categorized as "more adherent" if they had a score from 3 to 4 (criterion 1) or a score of 4 (criterion 2); patients with other scores were categorized as less adherent. Of all patients, 79. 8 % and 43. 1 % were classified as "more adherent" according to criterion 1 and criterion 2, respectively. With regard to the possible causes of non-adherence to treatment, statistically significant (p< 0. 05) associations were identified between "trust in the doctor" or "number of antihypertensive drugs used" and the level of adherence, according to criterion 2. These results indicated adequate adherence levels to drug treatment by the patients, and highlighted the importance of professional/patient interaction, trust in the doctor and the attitude by health professionals toward users...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXTO: A não-adesão ao tratamento medicamentoso, em algum grau, ocorre universalmente. É uma das principais causas de insucesso no tratamento das doenças crônicas, tal como a doença de Crohn. OBJETIVO: Em doentes com doença de Crohn, avaliar a prevalência e os fatores de risco associados à baixa adesão ao tratamento medicamentoso. MÉTODOS: No período entre julho de 2006 e julho de 2007 foram incluídos prospectivamente, para avaliação da não-adesão ao tratamento, 100 doentes com doença de Crohn em seguimento clínico no ambulatório de doenças inflamatórias intestinais. Os pacientes responderam ao Teste de Medida de Adesão a Tratamentos de <b>Morisky</b> e <b>Green,</b> modificado. De acordo com este teste, os pacientes foram classificados em dois grupos, {{conforme}} o grau de adesão: adesão e não-adesão. A não-adesão foi subdividida em intencional e não-intencional. Variáveis clínicas, psicológicas e farmacoterapêuticas foram pesquisadas na busca de possíveis fatores associados à não-adesão. RESULTADOS: Entre os pacientes avaliados, 64 % apresentaram escore compatível com não-adesão. O perfil mais frequente de não-adesão foi o do tipo não-intencional, e os pacientes mostraram ter conhecimento e motivação para o tratamento. Na comparação entre os dois grupos observou-se somente uma tendência a não-adesão entre os pacientes mais jovens (P = 0, 07) e de raça não-branca (P = 0, 06). Não houve correlação significativa entre o grau de adesão e as variáveis psicológicas e farmacoterapêuticas. CONCLUSÕES: Em pacientes com doença de Crohn, a prevalência de não-adesão ao tratamento medicamentoso é elevada (64 %). Indivíduos jovens e aqueles não-brancos parecem ser os mais predispostos à não-adesão. Portanto, é preciso estar alerta para sua ocorrência e, caso necessário, implementar medidas que busquem aumentar o grau de adesão destes pacientes. CONTEXT: Non-adherence to therapy, in {{any degree}} {{is a common}} event and occurs in several circumstances. It is one of {{most common cause of}} fail in therapy of chronic diseases and Crohn's disease is not an exception. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in patients with Crohn's disease the prevalence and the risk factors to non-adherence to therapy. METHODS: From July 2006, for 12 months, were included prospectively, for non-adhesion to therapy 100 patients with Crohn's disease that were assisted in a Center for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases of Universitary Hospital of Federal University of Juiz de Fora, MG, in Brazil. A modified <b>Morisky</b> & <b>Green</b> Test for Measure of Adherence to Therapy was answered by all of them. According to test the patients were classified in two groups defined as adherence and non-adherence, respectively, and the last one was separated in intentional and non-intentional adhesion. Clinical, psychological and pharmacotherapeutics variables were sought to find the factors related to non-adherence. RESULTS: Sixty four percent of total group were noticed to have a score of non-adherence to therapy according to used test and non-intentional was {{the most common type of}} behavior in such patients, and they demonstrated to be conscious of therapy. The comparison of adherent and non-adherent patients displayed a significant tendency to occurrence of non-adherence in younger (P = 0, 07) and in non-white patients (P = 0, 06). No correlation was observed in comparison of psychological and pharmacotherapeutics variables and non-adherence. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Crohn's disease the prevalence of non-adherence to therapy is high (64 %). The younger and non-white patients have higher propensity to non-adherence. In such circumstances efforts should be made to look for strategies to deal with this sort of people suffering from Crohn's disease, trying to increase the degree of adherence in this sort of patients...|$|R

There have been several recent symposia on community ecology (Strong et. al., 1984, Diamond and Case, 1987) which have covered {{a wide range of}} topics. The goal of the workshop at Davis was more narrow: to explore the role of scale in developing a theoretical approach to understanding communities. There are a number of aspects of scale that enter into attempts to understand ecological communities. One of the most basic is organizational scale. Should community ecology proceed by building up from population biology? This question and its ramifications are stressed throughout the book and explored in the first chapter by Simon <b>Levin.</b> Notions of <b>scale</b> have long been important in understanding physical systems. Thus, in understanding the interactions of organisms with their physical environment, questions of scale become paramount. These more physical questions illustrate the role scale plays in understanding ecology, and are discussed in chapter two by Akira Okubo...|$|R
