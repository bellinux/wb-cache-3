40|$|The present work {{is aimed}} at the study of a four {{cylinder}} <b>multipoint</b> port <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> gasoline engine combustion, performance and emission characteristics which is retrofitted to run with LPG injection. The findings of the experiments suggest that higher thermal efficiency and therefore improved fuel economy {{can be obtained from}} SI engines running on LPG as opposed to gasoline. The cycle-by-cycle variation of IMEP with LPG combustion can be reduced by advancing the idle ignition timing. The results of the study at wide open throttle opening conditions indicate that there is an increase in the brake thermal efficiency with LPG use in the engine at higher operating speeds when compared to gasoline at the factory set idle ignition timing of 5 o bTDC. The exhaust emissions of CO and HC have reduced considerably. But the NOX emission has increased considerably at elevated engine speeds with LPG fuel when compared to gasoline fuel operation. The results of LPG fuel operation at various idle ignition timings indicate that advancing the timing from 5 o bTDC to 6 o bTDC has resulted in increased brake thermal efficiency, and reduced emissions of CO and HC, compared to retarding the idle ignition timing to 4 o bTDC and 3 o bTDC. However advanced idle ignition timing has an adverse effect on NOX emissions as it increases further...|$|R

50|$|In non-diesel {{internal}} combustion engines, {{gasoline direct injection}} (GDI), also known as petrol direct injection, direct petrol injection, spark-ignited direct injection (SIDI) and fuel-stratified injection (FSI), is a variant of fuel injection employed in modern two-stroke and four-stroke gasoline engines. The gasoline is highly pressurized, and injected via a common rail fuel line directly into the combustion chamber of each cylinder, as opposed to conventional <b>multipoint</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> that injects fuel into the intake tract or cylinder port. Directly injecting fuel into the combustion chamber requires high-pressure injection, whereas low pressure is used injecting into the intake tract or cylinder port.|$|E
50|$|<b>Multipoint</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> (also called PFI, port fuel injection) injects fuel {{into the}} intake ports just {{upstream}} of each cylinder's intake valve, {{rather than at}} a central point within an intake manifold.
