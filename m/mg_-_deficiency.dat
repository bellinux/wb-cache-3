The five edible vegetables studied include Telfaria occidentalis (fluted pumpkin); Talinum triangulare (water leaf); Amaranthus hybridus (Amaranth or pigweed); Vernonia amygdalina (bitter leaf); and Solmun nigrum (garden egg leaf). The metal concentrations in the soil decreased with depth which possibly suggests anthropogenic sources of contamination. The levels of Pb > Ni > Cd in Enyigba top soil was observed to be above the US-EPA Regulatory Limits in that order. Elevated concentrations of heavy metals were recorded in all the vegetable samples from Enyigba Lead mine and they exceeded those of Abakaliki.

NDMA and DMNA {{have been found}} in drinking water, groundwater, and other media and are of concern due their toxicity. The authors evaluated biotransformation ofNDMAandDMNAby cultures enriched from contaminated groundwater growing on benzene, butane, methane, propane, or toluene.

These harmful elements represent {{the basis of a}} range of problems in the food chain, and are a potential hazard for animal and human health. It is therefore important to gauge their absolute and relative concentrations in soils that are used for crop production. In this study the arsenic and heavy metal concentrations in 274 mineral soil samples and 38 organogenic soil samples taken from South Savo province in 2000 were determined using the aqua regia extraction technique. The soil samples were collected from 23 farms. The elements analyzed were arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead and zinc. The median concentrations in the mineral soils were:As 2. 90 <b>mg</b> kg <b>–</b> 1, Cd 0. 084 <b>mg</b> kg <b>–</b> 1, Cr 17. 0 <b>mg</b> kg <b>–</b> 1, Cu 13. 0 <b>mg</b> kg <b>–</b> 1, Hg 0. 060 <b>mg</b> kg <b>–</b> 1, Ni 5. 4 <b>mg</b> kg <b>–</b> 1, Pb 7. 7 <b>mg</b> kg <b>–</b> 1, Zn 36. 5 <b>mg</b> kg <b>–</b> 1.

40|$|The {{morphogenetic}} {{potential of}} leaf callus cultures of Plumbago zeylanica was investigated to develop reliable protocols for shoot regeneration and somaclonal variation. Maximum callus proliferation was obtained Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2. 0 <b>mg</b> L <b>-</b> 1 BAP. The maximum shoot regeneration (16. 3 ± 0. 51) was achieved in five weeks when callus cultured on MS medium containing 0. 75 <b>mg</b> L <b>-</b> 1 BAP, 1. 0 <b>mg</b> L <b>-</b> 1 IAA and NAA each. Regenerated shoots were rooted on half strength MS medium supplemented with 0. 5 <b>mg</b> L <b>-</b> 1 NAA. The rooted plantlets were successfully established in soil.
