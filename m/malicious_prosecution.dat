5|$|Braithwaite and Raghip were {{released}} immediately. Silcott remained {{in jail for}} the 1984 murder of Anthony Smith. He received £17,000 compensation in 1991 for his conviction in the Blakelock case, and in 1995 was offered up to £200,000 in legal aid to sue the police for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The Metropolitan Police {{settled out of court}} in 1999, awarding him £50,000 for false imprisonment and <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution.</b> He was released on licence in October 2003 having served 17 years for Smith's murder.|$|E
5|$|Evidence against Croitoru and Gravelle was {{presented}} {{over the course}} of eight weeks in 2006, but the judge stated that the case against the two accused was not strong. Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant withdrew the charges on June 12, 2006. Following this action by the attorney general, both Croitoru and Andre Gravelle announced plans to file lawsuits against people involved with the prosecution. Gravelle is suing for $25 million, and Croitoru is seeking $15 million for wrongful imprisonment and <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution.</b> Hamilton Police Services was ordered to pay Gravelle $10,000 for court costs. In June 2006, Croitoru also pleaded guilty to the charges of extortion and violating the terms of his bail. As a result, he was forced to forfeit $10,000 of the bail money.|$|E
5|$|To the poorest, Nerva granted allotments of land worth up to 60 million sesterces. He {{exempted}} {{parents and}} their children from a 5% inheritance tax, and he made loans to Italian landowners on the condition that they pay interest of 5% to their municipality to support the children of needy families; alimentary schemes which were later expanded by Trajan, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius. Furthermore, numerous taxes were remitted and privileges granted to Roman provinces. Namely, he abolished abuses of the Fiscus Iudaicus, the additional tax which all Jews throughout the Empire had to pay: some of his coins bear the legend FISCI IUDAICI CALUMNIA SUBLATA (abolition of <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution</b> regarding the Jewish tax).|$|E

In 1847, Starkie became a judge in the Clerkenwell small-debts court.|$|R
5|$|A less violent side to Alexander's {{government}} {{is demonstrated by}} other evidence. Over a century after his time, his administrative decisions were still being cited as precedents. Some of these are known from a surviving edict issued on July 6, 68, {{less than a month}} after Nero's death. This denounces, and introduces measures against, a variety of abuses including inaccurate tax assessments, <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecutions</b> and the imprisonment of debtors by private creditors. The edict's only allusion to the chaotic political situation comes as a call for trust in the benevolence of the new Emperor, Galba, and his ability to put right the wrongs of the past. Alexander was making representations to Galba on behalf of the provincials, presumably representing the desired reforms as the price of loyalty from this vital grain-producing province.|$|R
25|$|Aleynikov {{sued the}} FBI agents who arrested him for <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution.</b> The judge {{dismissed}} {{the case with}} respect to Aleynikov's federal prosecution, finding that the agents were warranted in believing that Aleynikov had violated the National Stolen Property Act and the Economic Espionage Act. Aleynikov's <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution</b> claims in connection with his prosecution in New York state court were stayed pending the District Attorney's appeal of the New York trial court's decision to set aside his conviction.|$|E
25|$|On March 31, 2011, Judge James Beaty {{issued a}} ruling on the Evans et al. case, {{upholding}} claims against Nifong and his hired investigator Wilson for {{conspiracy to commit}} <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{in the course of}} their investigation; the city of Durham for negligence; Nifong, Wilson, and police investigators Gottlieb and Himan for <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution,</b> concealment of evidence, and fabrication of false evidence. However, the players' civil rights claims, which constituted the bulk of their Complaint, were dismissed on the grounds that the applicable civil rights laws pertained only to persons of African-American descent.|$|E

As for making any direct arrangement with your brother Seneca, that is out of the question, since it would be compromising felony, and subject me to punishment; but I can be passive, if I see fit, and your wishes will have great weight with me. The attempt to arrest my uncle and myself, should it ever be made, will only subject its instigators to action for <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecutions,</b> and gives me no concern. It is very doubtful how far we were disguised, {{in the sense of the}} statute, and it is certain we were not armed, in any sense. Without perjury therefore, such a prosecution must fail----" ...|$|R
50|$|After {{losing his}} seat, Bruce was elected for Renfrewshire on 25 January 1869, {{he was made}} Home Secretary by William Ewart Gladstone. His tenure of this office was {{conspicuous}} for a reform of the licensing laws, and {{he was responsible for}} the Licensing Act 1872, which made the magistrates the licensing authority, increased the penalties for misconduct in public-houses and shortened the number of hours for the sale of drink. In 1873 Bruce relinquished the home secretaryship, at Gladstone's request, to become Lord President of the Council, and was elevated to the peerage as Baron Aberdare, of Duffryn in the County of Glamorgan, on 23 August that year. Being a Gladstonian Liberal, Aberdare had hoped for a much more radical proposal to keep existing licensee holders for a further ten years, and to prevent any new applicants. Its unpopularity pricked his nonconformist's conscience, when like Gladstone himself he had a strong leaning towards Temperance. He had already pursued 'moral improvement' on miners in the regulations attempting to further ban boys from the pits. The Trades Union Act 1871 was another more liberal regime giving further rights to unions, and protection from <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecutions.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} decades of the United States grand juries played a major role in public matters. During that period {{counties}} followed the traditional practice of requiring all decisions be made by at least twelve of the grand jurors, (e.g., for a twenty-three-person grand jury, twelve people would constitute a bare majority). Any citizen could bring a matter before a grand jury directly, from a public work that needed repair, to the delinquent conduct of a public official, to a complaint of a crime, and grand juries could conduct their own investigations. In that era most criminal prosecutions were conducted by private parties, either a law enforcement officer, a lawyer hired by a crime victim or his family, or even by laymen. A layman could bring a bill of indictment to the grand jury; if the grand jury found there was sufficient evidence for a trial, that the act was a crime under law, and that the court had jurisdiction, it would return the indictment to the complainant. The grand jury would then appoint the complaining party to exercise the authority of an attorney general, that is, one having a general power of attorney to represent the state in the case. The grand jury served to screen out incompetent or <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecutions.</b> The advent of official public prosecutors in the later decades of the 19th century largely displaced private prosecutions.|$|R
25|$|The five convicted men sued New York City in 2003 for <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution,</b> racial discrimination, and {{emotional}} distress. The city refused {{to settle the}} suits for a decade under then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg, because the city's lawyers felt they would win. However, after Bill de Blasio became mayor and supported the settlement, the city settled the case for $41million in 2014. As of December 2014, the five men were pursuing an additional $52million in damages from New York State in the New York Court of Claims.|$|E
25|$|As of July 2010, only Sandra Dowling {{had been}} {{successfully}} prosecuted. Indicted on 25 felony counts, Dowling eventually {{pleaded guilty to}} patronage for giving a summer job to her daughter, a single class-2 misdemeanor which was not among the original counts, although {{as part of the}} plea bargain she also agreed to recuse herself from the Maricopa County Regional School District. Dowling later filed suit, alleging negligence, <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution,</b> abuse of process and several constitutional violations, although Arpaio won summary judgment against her claims.|$|E
25|$|Scalia's {{criticism}} was echoed by Eleventh Circuit judge Frank M. Hull {{in a case}} reheard to take Quon into account. In March 2010, she had written for a panel deciding Rehberg v. Paulk, {{a case in which}} a Georgia man had sued the Dougherty County district attorney alleging <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution</b> for an investigation into harassing faxes sent to a local hospital. Rehberg had also claimed his privacy was violated by his Internet Service Provider's (ISP) release of his emails from its server in response to a subpoena.|$|E
50|$|After {{completing}} his sentence in 2011 for crimes of racketeering, misusing charity money for boots, uniforms {{and other equipment}} for Islamic fighters in Bosnia and Chechnya, the feds argued that Enaam Arnaout should be stripped of his citizenship and deported. The case against Enaam Arnaout involves allegations that Arnaout lied about his past as a fundraiser for Osama Bin Laden and other mujahideen fighting in Afghanistan when he applied to become a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1993. The MLFA is currently seeking the return of documents and items seized in raids by the government after <b>malicious</b> government <b>prosecution.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of 'beyond reasonable doubt' was expounded in Woolmington v DPP 1935 UKHL 1:Juries are always told that, if conviction {{there is to}} be, the prosecution must prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. This statement cannot mean {{that in order to}} be acquitted the prisoner must “satisfy” the jury. This is the law as laid down in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Davies 29 Times LR 350; 8 Cr App R 211, the headnote of which correctly states that where intent is an ingredient of a crime there is no onus on the defendant to prove that the act alleged was accidental. Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt subject to what I have already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner, as to whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a <b>malicious</b> intention, the <b>prosecution</b> has not made out the case and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained.|$|R
500|$|Hartmann scored his 352nd {{and last}} aerial victory at midday on 8 May 1945, only {{hours before the}} war ended. Along with the {{remainder}} of JG52, he surrendered to United States Army forces and {{was turned over to}} the Red Army. In an attempt to pressure him into service with the Soviet-friendly East German Volksarmee, he was tried on fabricated charges of war crimes and convicted, his conviction being posthumously voided by a Russian court as a <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution.</b> [...] Hartmann was sentenced to 25 years of hard labour and spent 10 years in various Soviet prison camps and gulags until he was released in 1955.|$|E

But when the Ministry of Education decided to no longer wait on the Sangha Council's investigations, and pressed charges on Wat Phra Dhammakaya, the temple responded by suing for <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution.</b> The temple accused several leading people in the Ministry of abusing their position, and petitioned the Constitutional Court, calling the {{religious}} charges a violation of freedom of religion.

2500|$|A second {{civil action}} was then raised suing the Scottish Executive amongst {{others on the}} basis that a <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution</b> had been caused by {{dishonesty}} of the SCRO fingerprint experts. [...] On the morning that this was to be heard, in February 2006, McKie was offered and accepted £750,000 from the Scottish Executive in full settlement of her compensation claim, without admission of liability.

[...] At an earlier stage of the case against the Scottish Executive the Lord Advocate Colin Boyd argued that expert witnesses should always be immune from prosecution [...] even if they gave false evidence.|$|E
2500|$|Defamation is {{tarnishing}} {{the reputation}} of someone; it has two varieties, slander and libel. Slander is spoken defamation and libel is printed or broadcast defamation. [...] The two otherwise share the same features: making a factual assertion for which evidence does not exist. Defamation does not affect or hinder the voicing of opinions, but does occupy the same fields as rights to free speech in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, or Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Related to defamation in the U.S. are the actions for misappropriation of publicity, invasion of privacy, and disclosure. Abuse of process and <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution</b> are often classified as dignitary torts as well.|$|E
2500|$|The LAPD did {{not allow}} Mătăsăreanu to receive medical attention, stating that {{ambulance}} personnel were following standard procedure in hostile situations by refusing to enter [...] "the hot zone," [...] as Mătăsăreanu was still considered to be dangerous, and because there were still reports and/or the belief {{that there was a}} third gunman still loose. Some reports indicate that he was lying on the ground with no weapons for approximately an hour before ambulances arrived, and was groaning in pain and pleading for help. A lawsuit on behalf of Mătăsăreanu's children was filed against members of the LAPD, claiming that Mătăsăreanu's civil rights had been violated and that he was allowed to bleed to death. The lawsuit was tried in United States District Court in February and March 2000, and ended in a mistrial with a hung jury. The suit was later dropped when Mătăsăreanu's family agreed to dismiss the action with a waiver of <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On February 4, 2011, Gerald Guy Brummell of Trenton, Ontario filed a $90,000,000 {{lawsuit against}} 36 OPP officers, {{including}} Julian Fantino, in the Superior Court of Justice in Cobourg Ontario (File 11/11) alleging a conspiracy and coverup {{relating to the}} inappropriate use of the judicial system {{as a tool of}} revenge against Brummell and his family for complaining about a death threat by one of their officers. In early 2014 Superior Court Justice H.K. O’Connell sided with the government that the claim of <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution</b> was not supported by evidence. Brummell has appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. On his web site, Brummell alleged that Fantino was an accessory to the murders of Jessica Lloyd and Marie France Comeau, and claimed OPP were knowledgeable of the earlier crimes of Colonel Russell Williams prior to his murders. [...] The Crown settled the lawsuits brought against them by Williams victims, Larry and Bonnie Jones and [...] Massicotte.|$|E
2500|$|Case No. 11-1436 (C.A. 4), holding: [...] "To recapitulate, we hold as follows. We {{reverse the}} {{district}} court's denial of all defendants' motions {{to dismiss the}} federal claims alleged against them. We reverse the court's denial of the City's motion for summary judgment as to the state common-law claims alleged against it. We affirm the court's denial of Officers Gottlieb and Himan's motions to dismiss the state common-law <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution</b> claims alleged against them. We reverse the court's denial of the officers' motions to dismiss all other state common-law claims. We dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction the City's appeal of the state constitutional claims alleged against it. Finally, we remand the cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion." [...] The only claims to survive this decision were state constitutional claims. Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III concurred, ruling: [...] "A few additional observations may underscore the overblown nature of this case. Plaintiffs have sought to raise every experimental claim and to corral every conceivable defendant. The result is a case on the far limbs of law and one destined, were it to succeed in whole, to spread damage in all directions." ...|$|E
