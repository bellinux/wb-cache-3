25|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} infections {{of the mouth}} {{include the use of}} {{chlorhexidine}} <b>mouth</b> <b>wash</b> in those with poor immune function and washing out the mouth following the use of inhaled steroids. Little evidence supports probiotics for either prevention or treatment even among those with frequent vaginal infections. For infections of the mouth, treatment with topical clotrimazole or nystatin is usually effective. By mouth or intravenous fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B may be used if these do not work. A number of topical antifungal medications may be used for vaginal infections including clotrimazole. In those with widespread disease, an echinocandin such as caspofungin or micafungin is used. A number of weeks of intravenous amphotericin B may be used as an alternative. In certain groups at very high risk, antifungal medications may be used preventatively.|$|E
2500|$|The {{three primary}} {{compounds}} used as sugar substitutes in the United States are saccharin (e.g., Sweet'N Low), aspartame (e.g., Equal, NutraSweet) and sucralose (e.g., Splenda, Altern).

40|$|Background. Postoperative {{sore throat}} {{is a common}} {{complication}} seen after general anesthesia; different methods have been proposed for its prevention and treatment. One of these methods is <b>mouth</b> <b>washing</b> with normal saline. &# 13; Methods. This research was designed and executed to assess the above washing method. In a clinical trial study, two "one hundred cases" groups were selected. In one of them, <b>mouth</b> <b>washing</b> with normal saline was performed. A checklist was designed for data collection; which was filled out twice to reduce recall bias as much as possible; the second time, the checklist was filled out 24 hours after extubation. &# 13; Findings. The cases undergone <b>mouth</b> <b>washing</b> had less sore throat (P < 0. 001). The two groups did not have statistical differences regarding demographic characteristics. &# 13; Conclusion. The results suggest that washing of pharynx before extubation can decrease severity of post operative sore throat...|$|R

Results: In this study, three <b>mouth</b> <b>washes</b> show cytotoxic effect on the cultured cells, at commercially available concentration and even diluted and Irsha was found to be the most toxic one. Cytotoxicity of three mouthwashes was reduced with decreasing concentration. Conclusion: Our results showed that all three solutions were toxic to the cultured fibroblast.

5000|$|Oil pulling is a suggestive misnomer, {{implying}} that something bad is being {{pulled from the}} mouth (toxins and bacteria).

Oil pulling for general health or any other indication is pure pseudoscience. Detox claims are based on nothing, as are all detox claims.

5000|$|Hot {{salt water}} mouth baths (or hot salt water mouth washes, {{sometimes}} abbreviated to [...] "HSWMW") are also routinely used after oral surgery, to keep food debris out of healing wounds {{and to prevent}} infection. Some oral surgeons consider salt water mouthwashes the mainstay of wound cleanliness after surgery. In dental extractions, hot salt water mouthbaths should start about 24 hours after a dental extraction. The term mouth bath implies that the liquid is passively held in the mouth rather than vigorously swilled around, which could dislodge a blood clot. Once the blood clot has stabilized, the <b>mouth</b> <b>wash</b> can be used more vigorously. These mouthwashes tend to be advised about 6 times per day, especially after meals to remove food from the socket.|$|E

50|$|Salt water <b>mouth</b> <b>wash</b> {{is made by}} {{dissolving}} 0.5-1 {{teaspoon of}} table salt into a cup of water, which is as hot as possible without causing discomfort in the mouth. Saline has a mechanical cleansing action and an antiseptic action {{as it is a}} hypertonic solution in relation to bacteria, which undergo lysis. The heat of the solution produces a therapeutic increase in blood flow (hyperemia) to the surgical site, promoting healing. Hot salt water mouthwashes also encourage the draining of pus from dental abscesses. Conversely, if heat is applied {{on the side of the}} face (e.g., hot water bottle) rather than inside the mouth, it may cause a dental abscess to drain extra-orally, which is later associated with an area of fibrosis on the face (see cutaneous sinus of dental origin). Gargling with salt water is said to reduce the symptoms of a sore throat.|$|E
50|$|Initial jewelry {{is usually}} a labret stud or a captive bead ring, {{manufactured}} from high-grade surgical stainless steel, implant-grade titanium, or similar lightweight and inert metal. No matter which type of jewelry is used, the jewelry's diameter and length will be intentionally oversized to allow room for initial swelling. After healing, the jewelry can be replaced with a closer-fitting piece.A home-made saline solution made from non-iodized sea salt and hot distilled or filtered water is a common way to heal a lip piercing and avoid infection. This solution {{can be used to}} rinse out the mouth after eating (or the mouth can be rinsed with non-alcoholic, non-antimicrobial <b>mouth</b> <b>wash)</b> and to soak the outside of the piercing. Anything with alcohol, peroxide, iodine, or any strong soaps should be avoided because they may irritate the fresh piercing, and cause additional swelling and trauma during the healing process. Using peroxide, iodine, teatree oil, conventional antibacterial soap, or dish soap can damage or kill the skin in and around the piercing, extending the healing process. The use of Hydrogen peroxide can damage the piercing site more, resulting in irritation of the piercing. The ornament should be periodically cleansed to prevent bacterial plaque accumulation.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present thesis is to analyse a {{particular}} ritual treatment, the so-called mouth- washing, appearing in diverse rituals of ancient Mesopotamia and its implications for the status of the ritual object treated in this way. Instead of generalizing the function of this element as known from the eponymous <b>Mouth</b> <b>washing</b> ritual for induction of cult images, this thesis considers its employment in all its attested occurrences. The author assumes a strongly metaphorical character of mouth-washing and analyses the concept of purity underlying it. Its shifting significance in different rituals is observed and a typology of these is outlined. A following case study is devoted to the Ritual for covering a kettledrum. A close examination of the sources reveals a possible development of the tradition as well as the ritual's interconnectedness with the <b>Mouth</b> <b>washing</b> ritual. This relation is treated as a case of interrituality, a concept introduced by Burkhard Gladigow. The divine status of the kettledrum is achieved through the ritual for its covering which intentionally employs elements used in the ritual induction of cult images. A special emphasis laid on the kettledrum's status in Seleucid Uruk corresponds with wider socio-historical changes. Methodologically, the offered interpretation rests [...] ...|$|R
