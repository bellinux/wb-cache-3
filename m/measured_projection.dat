5000|$|In X-ray imaging, the {{acquired}} projection images generally {{suffer from}} fixed-pattern noise, {{which is one}} of the limiting factors of image quality. It may stem from beam inhomogeneity, gain variations of the detector response due to inhomogeneities in the photon conversion yield, losses in charge transport, charge trapping, or variations in the performance of the readout. Also, the scintillator screen may accumulate dust and/or scratches on its surface, resulting in systematic patterns in every acquired X-ray projection image. In X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), fixed-pattern noise is known to significantly degrade the achievable spatial resolution and generally leads to ring or band artifacts in the reconstructed images. Fixed pattern noise can be easily removed using flat field correction. In conventional flat field correction, projection images without sample are acquired with and without the X-ray beam turned on, which are referred to as flat fields (F) and dark fields (D).

Since the normal derivative of pressure is not normally measured, the applicability of the formulation is limited in this form. In this paper, alternative derivations of the Fourier shell identity in 1 D, 2 D polar and 3 D spherical polar coordinates are presented. The presented formulations do not require the normal derivative of pressure, thereby lending the formulas directly adaptable for Fourier based absorber reconstructions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cardiac C-arm CT is a {{promising}} technique that enables 3 D cardiac image acquisition and real-time fluoroscopy {{on the same}} system. Retrospective ECG gating techniques have already been adapted from clinical cardiac CT that allow 3 D reconstruction using retrospectively gated projection images of a multi-sweep C-arm CT scan according to the desired cardiac phase. However, {{it is known that}} retrospective gating of projection data does not provide an optimal signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) since the <b>measured</b> <b>projection</b> data is only partially considered during the reconstruction. In this work we introduce a new reconstruction technique for cardiac C-arm CT that provides increased SNR by including additional corrected and resampled filtered back-projections (FBP) from temporal windows outside of the targeted reconstruction phase. We take advantage of several motion corrected FDK-like reconstructions of the subject to increase SNR. In the presented results, using in vivo data from an animal model, the SNR could be increased by approximately 30 percent. ...|$|E

We found that the number of <b>measured</b> <b>projection</b> images and the quality of each measurement (quantified using average signal-noise-ratio) can be combined to a single factor, which is dominant to the constructed model resolution.

40|$|Purpose: Deadtime-count-loss (DTloss) {{correction}} using monitor source (MS) requires: 1) uniform fractional DTloss across FOV, 2) high statistics MS images {{both with}} & without the object. The aims are validating condition 1 {{and developing a}} practical protocol that satisfies conditions 2 with minimal additional study duration. Methods and Materials : SPECT images of non-uniform phantoms (4 GBq 99 mTc) along with MS (20 MBq 99 mTc) attached to each detector were acquired multiple times over 48 hours in photopeak and scatter energy window (EW) using Siemens-SymbiaS and GE-D 670. Planar images of the MS alone were acquired. Photopeak counts for the MS ROIs were > 100 kcts. Fractional DTloss uniformity across the FOV was evaluated by correlating count rates in different ROIs on projection images at different DTloss levels. The correction factor for each SPECT projection at every time point was calculated as the ratio of time-corrected MS count rates with & without the phantom. The DTloss-corrected projections for each SPECT acquisition were decay corrected to one time point. The correction accuracy was assessed against DTloss estimated by paralyzable model. The accuracy of projection-based DTloss correction for SPECT was evaluated. A method to model projection DTloss based on a subset of <b>measured</b> <b>projection</b> DTloss was investigated. The relation of DTloss between photopeak and scatter EW was explored. Results: The fractional DTloss was uniform across the FOV (r > 0. 99), validating condition 1. The MS method was accurate to > 99 % for planar and SPECT. Measured DTloss from 3 -to- 5 projections/detector {{may be used to}} estimate DTloss with accuracy > 98 % for all SPECT projections by modeling DTloss with <b>measured</b> <b>projection</b> rate.
