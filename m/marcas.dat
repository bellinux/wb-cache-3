5|$|Recognizing at {{an early}} age that he had an incisive mind for politics, <b>Marcas</b> had allied himself with an unnamed man of some fame who lacked wisdom and insight. They became a team, with the other man serving as the public face and <b>Marcas</b> as the advisor. Once his {{associate}} had ascended into office, however, he abandoned <b>Marcas,</b> then hired and abandoned him again. <b>Marcas</b> was left poor and unknown, resigned to duplicate the writing of others for very little pay.|$|E

5|$|Balzac {{began using}} {{characters}} from earlier works in his 1835 novel Le Père Goriot, {{and made the}} technique a hallmark of his fiction. In the case of Z. <b>Marcas,</b> the narrator– Charles Rabourdin, whose identity is only revealed {{at the end of}} the story– is in fact the son of a central character from Balzac's 1837 tale La Femme supérieure. The title character of that story is married to Xavier Rabourdin, who is unjustly ignored for a promotion to the head of his civil service department. At the end of the La Femme supérieure, Rabourdin pledges to his wife that they will enjoy success in the world of business. His son's poverty in Z. <b>Marcas</b> is evidence of his failure.|$|E
5|$|Although Z. <b>Marcas</b> {{features}} {{characters from}} other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism– both hallmarks of Balzac's style– it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership {{had led to}} mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France {{were in danger of}} being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest in the years to come.|$|E

5|$|Balzac {{published}} Z. <b>Marcas</b> in {{the first}} issue of the Revue Parisienne, 25 July 1840. It was republished a year later under the title La Mort d'un ambitieux ("The Death of an Ambitious Man"), in a collection from various authors called Le Fruit défendu ("Forbidden Fruit"). Shortly before his death, Balzac placed the story in the Scènes de la vie politique section of his collection La Comédie humaine.|$|E
5|$|Z. <b>Marcas</b> is a novelette by French author Honoré de Balzac first {{published}} in 1840. Set in contemporary Paris, it describes {{the rise and fall}} of a brilliant political strategist who is abandoned by the politicians he helps into power. Destitute and forgotten, he befriends a pair of students who live next door to him in a boarding-house. The story follows their many discussions about the political situation in France.|$|E
500|$|Charles Rabourdin's {{interactions}} with <b>Marcas</b> echo the difficulties {{he saw in}} his father's government career. As critic Herbert J. Hunt notes, <b>Marcas</b> [...] "represents in the political sphere what Rabourdin represents in the administrative sphere". Allan H. Pasco echoes this point: [...] "Charles has had the lesson of futility from two tutors: his father and <b>Marcas.</b> Outstanding men have no future in politics, in the administration, or in business– {{at least not in}} France." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to his distinctive name, Z. <b>Marcas</b> has a remarkable appearance which his neighbors notice immediately. The story's first line refers to his [...] ("striking") appearance. As usual in his later work, Balzac describes <b>Marcas</b> by relating him to an animal: [...] "L'animal de <b>Marcas</b> était le lion. Ses cheveux ressemblaient à une crinière, son nez était court, écrasé, large et fendu au bout comme celui d'un lion, il avait le front partagé comme celui d'un lion par un sillon puissant, divisé en deux lobes vigoureux." [...] ("The animal for <b>Marcas</b> was the lion. His hair was like a mane, his nose was short and flat; broad and dented at the tip like a lion's; his brow, like a lion's, was strongly marked with a deep median furrow, dividing two powerful bosses.") ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Z. <b>Marcas</b> nonetheless represents a fiery drive {{to succeed in}} the world of politics, an acute mind seeking to do good in the public sphere. One critic calls him [...] "ambition in its pure state". Like other persons of genius in La Comédie humaine, <b>Marcas</b> is seen as a reflection of Balzac's own ego and desire. Like <b>Marcas,</b> the author dreamed of fame and positive influence; as Balzac believed himself to be, the character is dismissed and manipulated by mediocre minds. Even their work habits– toiling at their desks throughout the night– are similar.|$|E
500|$|Although Balzac's Revue Parisienne {{lasted only}} three issues, Z. <b>Marcas</b> has {{remained}} a moderately popular story. Hunt notes that it has [...] "only subsidiary value", but biographer André Maurois calls it [...] "an admirable tale". Robb notes that Z. <b>Marcas</b> was an important herald of political realities to come, and provided a warning to the political class of the time.|$|E

500|$|Z. <b>Marcas</b> himself {{appears in}} one other Balzac story, Un prince de la bohème, {{which the author}} revised twice before it {{appeared}} in its final form. In the 1846 edition, the character of Marcel has been changed to Marcas; but {{this may have been}} a printer's error. As Anthony Pugh explains: [...] "This detail is inexplicable; the principal character of Z. <b>Marcas,</b> who does not otherwise appear outside his own story, seems a very unlikely candidate for the role. Could it be a misprint?" ...|$|E
500|$|Z. <b>Marcas</b> {{includes}} many {{other examples of}} realist detail as well. The students live in shabby environs, furnished by [...] ("only a scrap of thin carpet"). They share [...] ("a tawny twig of Turkish tobacco") with their neighbor, and the three discuss political personalities drawn directly from recent history, including William Pitt the Elder and the Voltigeurs. Still, realist detail is not commonly in the foreground of commentary about Z. <b>Marcas.</b> As Hunt explains, it is mostly remembered [...] "as a vehicle for a characteristic Balzacian whimsy".|$|E

500|$|Balzac {{was known}} for his use of realism, {{including}} exquisite detail when describing people and locations. His fanaticism about the name Z. <b>Marcas</b> is cited {{as an example of the}} author's [...] "zeal" [...] for [...] "close local color". Balzac's belief in the connection between one's name and one's destiny is brought to the fore; the pattern demonstrated in Z. <b>Marcas</b> reflects many in the larger collection of Balzac's work. As critic Charles Affron puts it: [...] "The creator of a universe so tied up with inner rhythms and resounding with so many echoes does not hesitate to imply that the germs of a character's failure can be found in the physical qualities of his name." [...] This idea came to Balzac from Laurence Sterne, as he acknowledged in his 1841 story Ursule Mirouët: [...] ("Should we not agree with Sterne in recognizing the occult power in names, which sometimes mock and sometimes define the characters of their possessors?") ...|$|E
500|$|Balzac insisted to Gozlan that by {{searching through}} the streets of Paris, they would find a name {{suitable}} for a character he had imagined, a political genius thwarted by the mediocrity of the time.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Low {{levels of}} daily energy {{expenditure}} (insufficient {{physical activity and}} increased sedentary time) {{have been associated with}} adverse health outcomes in young people. The Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and Adolescents (<b>MARCA)</b> is a computerized, self-report, use-of-time tool that can assess daily energy expenditure. The study aim was to validate the <b>MARCA</b> for the estimation of energy expenditure in young people, using the criterion standard doubly labeled water. MATERIALS/METHODS: Over a 15 day assessment period, 32 participants (10 - 18 years) completed the <b>MARCA</b> and underwent a doubly labeled water protocol. Indirect calorimetry was used to assess resting metabolic rate. Total daily energy expenditure (TEE) and activity-related energy expenditure (AEE) were estimated from both the <b>MARCA</b> and doubly labeled water. Association and agreement between methods for TEE and AEE were assessed using Spearman correlations and Bland-Altman plots, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to doubly labeled water, the <b>MARCA</b> over-estimated TEE by an average of 50 kcal/day (limits of agreement - 1 589 to 1 490 kcal/day) and under-estimated AEE 105 kcal/day (limits of agreement - 1 404 to 1 614 kcal/day). The <b>MARCA</b> showed strong correlation with doubly labeled water for TEE (rho= 0. 70, p< 0. 0001) and moderate correlation for AEE (rho= 0. 56, p= 0. 0009). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the <b>MARCA</b> indicated moderate validity for the assessment of daily TEE and AEE. The wide limits of agreement indicate the <b>MARCA</b> has greater utility for group-level rather than individual-level estimates...|$|R
