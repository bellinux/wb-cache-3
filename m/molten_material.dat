5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal. In addition to melting the base metal, a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of <b>molten</b> <b>material</b> (the weld pool) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material. Pressure may also be {{used in conjunction with}} heat, or by itself, to produce a weld. Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.|$|E

25|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{consensus of}} Earth and planetary scientists is that tektites consist of terrestrial debris that was ejected during {{the formation of}} an impact crater. During the extreme conditions created by an hypervelocity meteorite impact, near-surface terrestrial sediments and rocks were either melted, vaporized, or some combination of these and ejected from an impact crater. After ejection from the impact crater, the material formed millimeter- to centimeter-sized bodies of <b>molten</b> <b>material,</b> which as they re-entered the atmosphere, rapidly cooled to form tektites that fell to Earth to create a layer of distal ejecta hundreds or thousands of kilometers away from the impact site.|$|E
25|$|The first {{important}} {{event in the}} geologic evolution of the Moon was the crystallization of the near global magma ocean. It is not known with certainty what its depth was, but several studies imply a depth of about 500km or greater. The first minerals to form in this ocean were the iron and magnesium silicates olivine and pyroxene. Because these minerals were denser than the <b>molten</b> <b>material</b> around them, they sank. After crystallization was about 75% complete, less dense anorthositic plagioclase feldspar crystallized and floated, forming an anorthositic crust about 50km in thickness. The majority of the magma ocean crystallized quickly (within about 100 million years or less), though the final remaining KREEP-rich magmas, which are highly enriched in incompatible and heat-producing elements, could have remained partially molten for several hundred million (or perhaps 1 billion) years. It appears that the final KREEP-rich magmas of the magma ocean eventually became concentrated within the region of Oceanus Procellarum and the Imbrium basin, a unique geologic province that {{is now known as}} the Procellarum KREEP Terrane.|$|E

Loewenstein remarks on the {{intensity}} of Laura's passion: [...] "The presentation of a woman as a joyfully aggressive person is, in itself, a rare achievement in 1957". A 2002 retrospective of Bannon's books claims [...] "there were more explicit and nuanced representations of sexuality in those paperbacks than could be found almost anywhere else". Author Suzana Danuta Walters represents the eroticism in Bannon's books {{as a form of}} rebellion. In the Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review, Jenifer Levin writes, [...] "Know this: Beebo lives.

2500|$|Although {{portions}} {{of the center of}} the reactor core had been vaporized briefly, very little corium was recovered. The fuel plates showed signs of catastrophic destruction leaving voids, but [...] "no appreciable amount of glazed <b>molten</b> <b>material</b> was recovered or observed." [...] Additionally, [...] "There is no evidence of <b>molten</b> <b>material</b> having flowed out between the plates." [...] It is believed that rapid cooling of the core was responsible for the small amount of <b>molten</b> <b>material.</b> There was insufficient heat generated for any corium to reach or penetrate the bottom of the reactor vessel. The reactor vessel was removed on November 29, 1961 without incident. The only holes {{in the bottom of the}} vessel were the ones bored through with borescopes to determine the condition of the melted core.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} Korean {{sodium-cooled}} fast reactor (SFR) program, early dispersion of the molten metal fuel within a subchannel is suggested as an inherent safety {{strategy in the}} initiating phase of a hypothetical core disruptive accident (HCDA). This safety strategy provides a negative reactivity driven by the melt dispersion; therefore, it could reduce the possibility of occurrence of a severe recriticality event. In the initiating phase, the melt could be injected into the subchannel horizontally by the internal pressure of the fuel pin. Complex phenomena occur during intermixing of the melt with the coolant after the horizontal injection of the melt. It is rather difficult to understand the several combined mechanisms that occur {{that are related to}} the dispersion and fragmentation of the melt. Thus, it seems worthwhile to study the horizontal injection of melt at lower temperatures, which could help to observe the dispersion phenomenon and understand the fragmentation mechanism. In this work, for a parametric study, tests were performed under structural conditions, coolant void conditions, and boiling conditions. As a result, in some cases, the injected <b>molten</b> <b>materials</b> were stuck around the injection hole. On the other hand, the <b>molten</b> <b>materials</b> were dispersed upward sufficiently well under the boiling condition when R 123 was used as the coolant.

2500|$|Partially molten basalt in {{the mantle}} wedge moves upwards {{until it reaches}} {{the base of the}} {{overriding}} crust. Once there, the basaltic melt can either underplate the crust, creating a layer of <b>molten</b> <b>material</b> at its base, or it can move into the overriding plate in the form of dykes. If it underplates the crust, the basalt can (in theory) cause partial melting of the lower crust due to the transfer of heat and volatiles. Models of heat transfer, however, show that arc basalts emplaced at temperatures 1100–1240°C cannot provide enough heat to melt lower crustal amphibolite. [...] Basalt can, however, melt pelitic upper crustal material. [...] Andesitic magmas generated in island arcs, therefore, are probably the result of partial melting of the crust.|$|E
2500|$|In large impacts, {{as well as}} {{material}} displaced and ejected to form the crater, significant volumes of target material may be melted and vaporized together with the original impactor. [...] Some of this impact melt rock may be ejected, {{but most of it}} remains within the transient crater, initially forming a layer of impact melt coating the interior of the transient cavity. [...] In contrast, the hot dense vaporized material expands rapidly out of the growing cavity, carrying some solid and <b>molten</b> <b>material</b> within it as it does so.

2500|$|During subduction, the subducted oceanic {{crust is}} {{submitted}} to increasing pressure and temperature, leading to metamorphism. Hydrous minerals such as amphibole, zeolites, chlorite etc. (which {{are present in}} the oceanic lithosphere) dehydrate as they change to more stable, anhydrous forms, releasing water and soluble elements into the overlying wedge of mantle. Fluxing water into the wedge lowers the solidus of the mantle material and causes partial melting. [...] Due to the lower density of the partially <b>molten</b> <b>material,</b> it rises through the wedge until it reaches the lower boundary of the overriding plate. Melts generated in the mantle wedge are of basaltic composition, but they have a distinctive enrichment of soluble elements (e.g. potassium (K), barium (Ba), and lead (Pb)) which are contributed from sediment that lies {{at the top of the}} subducting plate. Although there is evidence to suggest that the subducting oceanic crust may also melt during this process, the relative contribution of the three components (crust, sediment, and wedge) to the generated basalts is still a matter of debate.|$|E
2500|$|More than 400 {{million years}} ago, in the Devonian Period, the plate {{tectonics}} {{movement of the}} Earth's crust allowed <b>molten</b> <b>material</b> to bubble up from the Earth's interior.

[...] The unique landscape of Peggy's Cove and surrounding areas was subsequently carved [...] by the migration of glaciers and the ocean tides. [...] About 20,000 years ago, an ice ridge moved south from Canada's Arctic region covering much of North America. [...] Along with {{the ebb and flow of}} the glaciers, the ice ridge eventually melted and shifted and in the process scooped away and scoured large sections of rock, vegetation, and topsoil. As melted land glaciers flowed back to the oceans the changing tidal flows and rising sea levels filled the scarred areas with water, forming coves and inlets. [...] Large boulders composed of 415-million-year-old Devonian granite, called glacial erratics, were lifted by the ice and carried for long distances before being deposited upon the landscape as the ice receded, leaving rugged barrens. [...] The movement of the glacial ice and rocks left scouring marks in the bedrock that are still visible.|$|E
