25|$|Forest floors under stands {{dominated}} by white spruce respond {{in ways that}} vary with site conditions, including the disturbance history of the site (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Composition, biomass, and <b>mineral</b> <b>soil</b> {{physical and chemical properties}} are affected. In Alaska, the accumulation of organic layers (to greater thicknesses in mature stands of spruce than those in hardwood stands on similar sites) leads to decreased soil temperatures, in some cases leading to the development of permafrost (Viereck 1970a, b, Viereck et al. 1983). Acidity of the <b>mineral</b> <b>soil</b> sampled at an average depth of 17nbsp&cm in 13 white spruce stands on abandoned farmland in Ontario increased by 1.2 pH units over a period of 46 years (Brand et al. 1986).|$|E

500|$|The ectomycorrhizal {{structures}} of H.peckii are among {{a few in}} the Bankeraceae that have been studied in detail. They are characterized by a plectenchymatous mantle—a layer of tissue made of hyphae tightly arranged in a parallel orientation, or palisade, and which rarely branch or overlap each other. These hyphae, along with adhering <b>mineral</b> <b>soil</b> particles, are embedded in a gelatinous matrix. The hyphae of the ectomycorrhizae can become chlamydospores, an adaptation that helps the fungus tolerate unfavorable conditions. Chlamydospores of H.peckii have a peculiar structure—markedly distinct from those of other Bankeraceae—with thick, smooth inner walls and an outer wall that is split radially into warts. The most striking characteristic of the ectomycorrhizae {{as a whole is}} the way the black outer layers of older sections are shed, giving a [...] "carbonized appearance". The majority of the underground biomass of the fungus is concentrated near the surface, most likely as [...] "mycelial mats"—dense clusters of ectomycorrhizae and mycelium. The mycelium is also known to extend far beyond the site of the fruit bodies, as far as [...] away.|$|E

Whereas spatial autocorrelation could be detected for the C loads in the humus layers neither the C amounts in <b>mineral</b> <b>soils</b> nor in living forest trees/dead wood were spatially autocorrelated.

30|$|In boreal conifer forests, {{nitrogen}} (N) is {{the most}} common fertilizer on <b>mineral</b> <b>soils</b> (Saarsalmi and Mälkönen 2001) whereas phosphorus (P) and potassium are used in peatland forests. Fertilizers developed for <b>mineral</b> <b>soils</b> often include some phosphorus, in addition to nitrogen, especially when Norway spruce stands are fertilized (Kukkola and Saramäki 1983; Hedwall et al. 2014). Forests that have been under slash and burn cultivation in the past often suffer from the lack of boron, resulting in growth disturbances. These disturbances are easily mitigated by boron fertilizers (Bergh et al. 2014). Wood ash and lime are also used as forest fertilizers (e.g. Nohrstedt 2001).|$|R

However, experimental work of Tsuchiya and Shimogaki [12] reported that conifer species showed higher Al and Si concentrations in bark ashes than wood ashes but that hardwood species showed the opposite tendency. One explanation for this discrepancy may be the contamination of <b>mineral</b> <b>soils</b> [5]. While the bark sample of the experimental work of Tsuchiya and Shimogaki [12] was washed before ash was generated in a muffle furnace, the bark pellet fuel combusted in our studies seemed to contain <b>mineral</b> <b>soils</b> that contaminated during harvesting and processing.

I sought to characterize soils and foliage associated with four common canopy tree species (Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, and bigleaf maple) in mixed-species old-growth forests of the Oregon Coast Range and to determine whether and how soils differ among the tree species. Sampling was replicated at eight forest sites to assess the generality of tree-species soils relationships across this region.

Foliar nutrient concentrations, which reflect active nutrient cycling by the trees, were also determined for C, N, P, Ca, Mg, and K. Results were analyzed with respect to two complementary conceptual models of tree species-soils relationships. In a depth-based model, trees were inferred to influence soil properties if surface <b>mineral</b> <b>soils</b> (0 to 10 cm) differed beneath the canopies of tree species, but deeper <b>mineral</b> <b>soils</b> (10 to 20 cm) did not.

40|$|International audience& Context Prediction of {{the effect}} of harvests and climate change (CC) on the changes in carbon stock of forests is {{necessary}} both for CC mitigation and adaptation purposes. & Aims We assessed the impact of roundwood and fuelwood removals and climate change (CC) on the changes in carbon stock of Finnish forests during 2007 – 2042. We considered three harvest scenarios: two based on the recent projections of roundwood and fuelwood demand, and the third reflecting the maximum sustainable cutting level. We ap-plied two climate scenarios: the climate was in the state that prevailed around year 2006, or it changed according to the IPCC SRES A 1 B scenario. & Methods We combined the large-scale forestry model MELA with the soil carbon model Yasso 07 for <b>mineral</b> <b>soils.</b> For soils of drained, forested peatlands, we used a method based on emission factors. & Results The stock change of trees accounted for approxi-mately 80 % of the total stock change. Trees and <b>mineral</b> <b>soils</b> acted as carbon sinks and the drained peatland soils as a carbon source. The forest carbon sink increased clearly in both of the demand-based scenarios, reaching the level of 13 – 20 Tg C/year (without CC). The planned increase in the use of bioenergy reduced the forest sink by 2. 6 Tg C/year. CC increased the forest carbon sink in 2042 by 38 %– 58 % depending on the scenario. CC decreased the sink of <b>mineral</b> <b>soils</b> in the initial years of the simulations; after 2030, the effect was slightly positive. CC increased the emissions from the drained peatland soils. & Conclusions It is likely that forest land in Finland acts as a carbon sink in the future. The changes in carbon stocks of trees, <b>mineral</b> <b>soils,</b> and peatland soils respond differently to CC and fuelwood and roundwood harvests...|$|R
