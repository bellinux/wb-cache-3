These projects {{have been at the}} forefront of recent tieback technology development, and have been as diverse as the Norsk Hydro Troll Pilot subsea separation system and the Petrobras SBMS <b>multiphase</b> pump <b>project,</b> to new downhole gauges with remote, real time monitoring, such as the Shell ETAP program. Many of these projects have already been installed or are scheduled for phased installation over the next year or two. Optical fiber has been critical to these programs for a variety of reasons, ranging from data security for fiscal metering subsea through communication bandwidth and electrical noise immunity, to CAPEX reduction for Integrated Service Umbilicals for very deep-water installation (> 2000 m). Many of the goals for the tieback community can be achieved only with the aid of fiber-optic communication. Long step-out distances, or eventually tieback to shore, can benefit from fiber’s unrepeated communication distances of greater than 100 km. High-power, subsea pumps needed to pressure boost fluids over these step-out distances need electrical noise immunity, inherent in optical fiber. Umbilicals designed for long step-outs can be more cost efficient using optical fiber in high-density, small cable designs. While the control systems for complex subsea installations need increased bandwidth, which can easily be supplied by optical fiber, while wet-mate hybrid connectors allow modular installation...|$|R
40|$|Nonprofit {{organizations}} play {{a pivotal}} role in recent efforts to devolve public responsi-bilities to lower levels of government and other sectors. The capacity of these organiza-tions to serve as the public safety net, however, has come under question. This <b>multiphase</b> research <b>project</b> focused on the impact of welfare reform on community-based nonprofits in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. The study includes surveys, focus groups, and a case study. Results to date strongly suggest that, in spite of their importance to the welfare reform effort, the capacity of smaller nonprofits to adopt the business-oriented approach required to meet the expectations of government contracts is profoundly limited. This study dis-cusses the implications of these findings for an enduring issue in political theory, the role of nonprofits as schools or laboratories of citizenship, and suggests that the loss of their public character is in danger of going unnoticed. Nonprofit organizations play {{a pivotal role}} in ongoing efforts to devolve fed-eral government programs and transfer public responsibilities to the local level. In the era of welfare reform, the capacity of social service organizations to serve as the public safety net in the manner implied by devolution propo-nents has come under question. Partnership between governments and the nonprofit sector has undergone significant stress as it is transformed by wel-fare and related policy initiatives; the long-term effects of these changes on both partners are still imperfectly understood (Salamon, 1995; Smith, 1995). Devolution refers to the collective efforts to shift responsibility for federal programs down to the state and local level. The driving force behind these changes is the idea that social programs run by the federal government have been ineffective, unwieldy, and excessively expensive (Gold, 1996).

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{advocated}} that {{interventions to}} improve clinical practice {{should be developed}} using a systematic approach and intervention development methods should be reported. However, previous interventions aimed at ensuring that older people receive appropriate polypharmacy have lacked details on their development. This study formed part of a <b>multiphase</b> research <b>project</b> which aimed to develop an intervention to improve appropriate polypharmacy in older people in primary care. Methods The target behaviours for the intervention were prescribing and dispensing of appropriate polypharmacy to older patients by general practitioners (GPs) and community pharmacists. Intervention development followed a systematic approach, including previous mapping of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) to key domains from the Theoretical Domains Framework that were perceived by GPs and pharmacists to influence the target behaviours. Draft interventions were developed to operationalise selected BCTs through team discussion. Selection of an intervention for feasibility testing was guided by {{a subset of the}} APEASE (Affordability, Practicability, Effectiveness/cost-effectiveness, Acceptability, Side-effects/safety, Equity) criteria. Results Three draft interventions comprising selected BCTs were developed, targeting patients, pharmacists and GPs, respectively. Following assessment of each intervention using a subset of the APEASE criteria (affordability, practicability, acceptability), the GP-targeted intervention was selected for feasibility testing. This intervention will involve a demonstration of the behaviour and will be delivered as an online video. The video demonstrating how GPs can prescribe appropriate polypharmacy during a typical consultation with an older patient will also demonstrate salience of consequences (feedback emphasising the positive outcomes of performing the behaviour). Action plans and prompts/cues will be used as complementary intervention components. The intervention is designed to facilitate the prescribing of appropriate polypharmacy in routine practice. Conclusion A GP-targeted intervention to improve appropriate polypharmacy in older people has been developed using a systematic approach. Intervention content has been specified using an established taxonomy of BCTs and selected to maximise feasibility. The results of a future feasibility study will help to determine if the theory-based intervention requires further refinement before progressing to a larger scale randomised evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Lynch {{syndrome}} is a hereditary cancer with confirmed carriers {{at high risk}} for colorectal (CRC) and extracolonic cancers. The purpose of the current study was to develop a greater understanding of the factors influencing decisions about disease management post-genetic testing. Methods The study used a grounded theory approach to data collection and analysis as part of a <b>multiphase</b> <b>project</b> examining the psychosocial and behavioral impact of predictive DNA testing for Lynch syndrome. Individual and small group interviews were conducted with individuals from 10 families with the MSH 2 intron 5 splice site mutation or exon 8 deletion. The data from confirmed carriers (n = 23) were subjected to re-analysis to identify key barriers to and/or facilitators of screening and disease management. Results Thematic analysis identified personal, health care provider and health care system factors as dominant barriers to and/or facilitators of managing Lynch syndrome. Person-centered factors reflect risk perceptions and decision-making, and enduring screening/disease management. The perceived knowledge and clinical management skills of health care providers also influenced participation in recommended protocols. The health care system barriers/facilitators are defined in terms of continuity of care and coordination of services among providers. Conclusions Individuals with Lynch syndrome often encounter multiple barriers to and facilitators of disease management that go beyond the individual to the provider and health care system levels. The current organization and implementation of health care services are inadequate. A coordinated system of local services capable of providing integrated, efficient health care and follow-up, populated by providers with knowledge of hereditary cancer, is necessary to maintain optimal health. </p...|$|E

The first phase of this project included surveys of both current UMMS medical students and donors concerning their perceptions of such a program. A five‐question survey administered via Qualtrics software was electronically mailed to all current medical students at UMMS, and a survey was mailed to registered and potential donors requesting information from the UMMS on anatomical donations. A total of 224 medical student responses (response rate 33 %) and 54 donor responses (response rate 27 %) were received. Seventy‐four percent of students and 81 % of donors reported they would participate in this program if it existed. Students and donors supported the implementation of this program for varying reasons, though many felt strongly they {{would not want to}} participate in a donor interview program. These qualitative results support those of previous studies that show a majority of students desire a closer personal relationship with the donor, and these are the first results to be reported on donor perceptions of a donor interview program. Although many students and donors are in favor of instituting this program, others feel strongly that such an experience could be traumatic. The causes of these differing reactions need to be further explored, and the opinions of those who object to this study will be respected by maintaining voluntary participation in future phases of this study.

40|$|Objective: There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in {{the potential benefits of}} public involvement (PI) in health and social care research. However, there has been little examination of values underpinning PI or how these values might differ for different groups with an interest in PI in the research process. We aimed to explore areas of consensus and conflict around normative, substantive and process-related values underpinning PI. Design: Mixed method, three-phase, modified Delphi study, conducted {{as part of a larger}} <b>multiphase</b> <b>project.</b> Setting: The UK health and social care research community. Participants: Stakeholders in PI in research, defined as: clinical and non-clinical academics, members of the public, research managers, commissioners and funders; identified via research networks, online searches and a literature review. Results: We identified high levels of consensus for many normative, substantive and process-related issues. However, there were also areas of conflict in relation to issues of bias and representativeness, and around whether the purpose of PI in health and social care research is to bring about service change or generate new knowledge. There were large differences by group in the percentages endorsing the ethical justification for PI and the argument that PI equalises power imbalances. With regard to practical implementation of PI, research support infrastructures were reported as lacking. Participants reported shortcomings in the uptake and practice of PI. Embedding PI practice and evaluation in research study designs was seen as fundamental to strengthening the evidence base.

40|$|Background: Treatment {{resistance}} {{is a common}} problem in therapy of depression causing psychological strain in patients and excessive costs. Reduction of residual symptoms {{reduces the risk of}} relapse significantly, therefore full remission should be the aim. The present studies examined prospects for improvement of antidepressant therapy to avoid (respectively overcome) resistance to therapy. Methods: Effectiveness of algorithm guided therapy in inpatient depressive patients was examined within the <b>multiphase</b> German Algorithm <b>Project</b> (GAP). 148 patients in GAP 2 were treated using a standardized stepwise drug treatment regimen (SSTR) or treatment as usual (TAU). Groups were compared respectively their direct treatment costs and total time in hospital, followed by a cost effectiveness analysis. In GAP 3 429 patients were randomly assigned into one of five trial arms. Beside the evaluation of prevalence of anxious depression and the definition of clinical and sociodemographic correlates, treatment outcome was compared between patients with anxious and nonanxious depression and effectiveness of algorithm guided treatment was determined. In a further study a group psychotherapy intervention (Euthymic Therapy = ET) was evaluated in a randomized controlled design with 46 (partially) remitted depressive outpatients. Results: SSTR resulted in GAP 2 with a higher remission rate (while study duration: SSTR: 54. 05 %; TAU: 39. 19 %, χ 2 = 3. 3; p= 0. 07. While total time in hospital: SSTR: 68. 92 %; TAU: 47. 30 %, χ 2 = 7. 1; p= 0. 008) and was more cost effective than TAU (study duration: SSTR: 20035 € (SD+/- 15970 €), TAU: 38793 € (SD+/- 31853 €), p<= 0. 0001. Total time in hospital: SSTR: 31285 € (SD+/- 23451 €), TAU: 38581 € (SD+/- 28449 €), p<= 0. 041). Anxious depression had a prevalence of 49 %. Anxious depressive patients required a longer time to remission (30 +/- 2. 8 days in nonanxious depression vs. 40 +/- 3. 4 days in anxious depression; log-rank Test, χ 2 = 16. 99, p= 0. 000) and had a lower probability to reach remission [48. 6 % vs. 61. 5 %, OR= 0. 63 (95 % CI 0. 42 - 0. 92); p= 0. 018]. Like the control group´s psychoeducational intervention ET caused a reduction of depressive residual symptoms. This effect remained relatively stable over a period of three months [BDI: F(1. 674) = 5. 668; p= 0. 008, r= 0. 37. HAMD- 21 : F(1. 857) = 4. 282; p= 0. 020; r= 0. 33]. Concerning self-care ET showed by trend a superior effect compared to the control group. Conclusion: Algorithm guided treatment results in a higher remission rate and therefore in cost reduction. Anxious depression is a risk factor for nonresponse to antidepressant treatment and shows the necessity of identifying specific treatment strategies to avoid, respectively overcome treatment resistance and chronic clinical courses. ET seems to be an effective method particularly for the treatment of residual symptoms and thus expands the range of effective therapies...|$|R
40|$|Objective To explore {{areas of}} {{consensus}} and conflict {{in relation to}} perceived public involvement (PI) barriers and drivers, perceived impacts of PI and ways of evaluating PI approaches in health and social care research. Background Internationally and within the UK the recognition of potential benefits of PI in health and social care research is gathering momentum and PI is increasingly identified by organisations as a prerequisite for funding. However, there is relatively little examination of the impacts of PI and how those impacts might be measured. Design Mixed method, three-phase, modified Delphi technique, conducted {{as part of a}} larger MRC <b>multiphase</b> <b>project.</b> Sample Clinical and non-clinical academics, members of the public, research managers, commissioners and funders. Findings This study found high levels of consensus about the most important barriers and drivers to PI. There was acknowledgement that tokenism was common in relation to PI; and strong support for the view that demonstrating the impacts and value of PI was made more difficult by tokenistic practice. PI was seen as having intrinsic value; nonetheless, there was clear support for the importance of evaluating its impact. Research team cohesion and appropriate resources were considered essential to effective PI implementation. Panellists agreed that PI can be challenging, but can be facilitated by clear guidance, together with models of good practice and measurable standards. Conclusions This study is the first to present empirical evidence of the opinions voiced by key stakeholders on areas of consensus and conflict in relation to perceived PI barriers and drivers, perceived impacts of PI and the need to evaluate PI. As such it further contributes to debate around best practice in PI, the potential for tokenism and how best to evaluate the impacts of PI.

This manuscript is {{the first part of}} a larger geophysical <b>multiphase</b> <b>project</b> [...] lead by LANL [...] that aims to develop comprehensive modeling tools for large-scale, atmospheric, transient-buoyancy dusty jets and plume (e. g., plinian clouds, nuclear ''mushrooms'', ''supercell'' forest fire plumes) and for boundary-dominated geophysical multiphase gravity currents (e. g., dusty surges, diluted pyroclastic flows, dusty gravity currents in street canyons). LES is a partially deterministic approach constructed on either a spatial- or a temporal-separation between the large and small scales of the flow, whereas RANS is an entirely probabilistic approach constructed on a statistical separation between an ensemble-averaged mean and higher-order statistical moments (the so-called ''fluctuating parts''). Within this specific multiphase context, both turbulence approaches are built up upon the same phasic binary-valued ''function of presence''. This function of presence formally describes the occurrence [...] or not [...] of any phase at a given position and time and, therefore, allows to derive the same basic multiphase Navier-Stokes model for either the RANS or the LES frameworks. The only differences between these turbulence frameworks are the closures for the various ''turbulence'' terms involving the unknown variables from the fluctuating (RANS) or from the subgrid (LES) parts. Even though the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic models for RANS and LES have the same set of Partial Differential Equations, the physical interpretations of these PDEs cannot be the same, i. e., RANS models an averaged field, while LES simulates a filtered field. In this manuscript, we also demonstrate that this multiphase model fully fulfills the second law of thermodynamics and fulfills the necessary requirements for a well-posed initial-value problem. In the next manuscripts, we will further develop specific closures for multiphase RANS, LES, and hybrid-LES...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Prenatal {{records are}} {{potentially}} powerful tools for {{the translation of}} best-practice evidence into routine prenatal care. Although all jurisdictions in Canada use standardized prenatal records to guide care and provide data for health surveillance, their content related to risk factors such as maternal smoking and alcohol use varies widely. Literature is lacking on how prenatal records are developed or updated to integrate research evidence. This <b>multiphase</b> <b>project</b> aimed to identify key contextual factors influencing decision-making and evidence use among Canadian prenatal record committees (PRCs), and formulate recommendations for the prenatal record review process in Canada. Methods Phase 1 comprised key informant interviews with PRC leaders across 10 Canadian jurisdictions. Phase 2, was a qualitative comparative case study of PRC factors influencing evidence-use and decision-making in five selected jurisdictions. Interview data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Phase 3 involved a dissemination workshop with key stakeholders to review and refine recommendations derived from Phases 1 and 2. Results Prenatal record review processes differed considerably across Canadian jurisdictions. PRC decision-making was complex, revealing the competing functions of the prenatal record as a clinical guide, documentation tool and data source. Internal contextual factors influencing evidence use included PRC resources to conduct evidence reviews; group composition and dynamics; perceived function of the prenatal record; and expert opinions. External contextual factors included concerns about user buy-in; health system capacities; and pressures from public health stakeholders. Our recommendations highlight the need for: broader stakeholder involvement and explicit use of decision-support strategies to support the revision process; a national template of evidence-informed changes {{that can be used}} across jurisdictions; consideration of both clinical and surveillance functions of the prenatal record; and dissemination plans to communicate prenatal record modifications. Conclusions Decision-making related to prenatal record content involves a negotiated effort to balance research evidence with the needs and preferences of prenatal care providers, health system capacities as well as population health priorities. The development of a national template for prenatal records would reduce unnecessary duplication of PRC work and enhance the consistency of prenatal care delivery and perinatal surveillance data across Canada...|$|E
40|$|Mixed method, three-phase, {{modified}} Delphi technique, conducted {{as part of}} {{a larger}} MRC multiphase project: [URL] is a freely-available open access publication. Please cite the published version which is available via the DOI link in this recordAbstract Objective To explore areas of consensus and conflict in relation to perceived public involvement (PI) barriers and drivers, perceived impacts of PI and ways of evaluating PI approaches in health and social care research. Background Internationally and within the UK the recognition of potential benefits of PI in health and social care research is gathering momentum and PI is increasingly identified by organisations as a prerequisite for funding. However, there is relatively little examination of the impacts of PI and how those impacts might be measured. Design Mixed method, three-phase, modified Delphi technique, conducted {{as part of a}} larger MRC <b>multiphase</b> <b>project.</b> Sample Clinical and non-clinical academics, members of the public, research managers, commissioners and funders. Findings This study found high levels of consensus about the most important barriers and drivers to PI. There was acknowledgement that tokenism was common in relation to PI; and strong support for the view that demonstrating the impacts and value of PI was made more difficult by tokenistic practice. PI was seen as having intrinsic value; nonetheless, there was clear support for the importance of evaluating its impact. Research team cohesion and appropriate resources were considered essential to effective PI implementation. Panellists agreed that PI can be challenging, but can be facilitated by clear guidance, together with models of good practice and measurable standards. Conclusions This study is the first to present empirical evidence of the opinions voiced by key stakeholders on areas of consensus and conflict in relation to perceived PI barriers and drivers, perceived impacts of PI and the need to evaluate PI. As such it further contributes to debate around best practice in PI, the potential for tokenism and how best to evaluate the impacts of PI. These findings have been used in the development of the Public Involvement Impact Assessment Framework (PiiAF), an online resource which offers guidance to researchers and members of the public involved in the PI process.

40|$|Our {{contemporary}} American food {{system has}} created complex environments for decisions and actions around food, and those decisions {{have implications for}} culture, health, natural resources, social relations, and the economy. And yet, as scholars, {{we do not understand}} the particulars of how people actually cook for themselves and their families. This study explores how race and socioeconomic class interact with individual experience of 2 ̆ 2 food agency, 2 ̆ 2 or personal capacity to plan and prepare meals within one 2 ̆ 7 s food environment. It is one stage in a <b>multiphase</b> <b>project</b> developing a comprehensive theory of food agency, applicable in any context; a scale for measuring that agency; and a cooking pedagogy for increasing it. This research was based on an explanatory sequential mixed methods design: a qualitative follow-up to quantitative research (see Creswell 2 ̆ 6 Plano Clark, 2011). It is an in-depth qualitative investigation with low-income participants of color, a population that had previously not been included in the development of food agency theory. The study 2 ̆ 7 s population was a mix of Drexel University students and community residents of Mantua, in Philadelphia, PA, and was recruited from Drexel 2 ̆ 7 s Healthy Cooking Techniques summer course. Data collection included semi-structured interviews and survey administration, and also utilized food agency scale survey responses. Analysis and results are divided into two papers, one narrative, and one a comparison between quantitative components of the food agency scale and corresponding qualitative data. Narrative analysis reinforces the notion that food agency is incredibly complex and self-referential. People with high self-efficacy around food may feel like they have a high level of agency, even if they can identify ways that societal structures impede them. Mixed-methods analysis reveals aspects of food agency that are not reflected by the scale: specifically, strategies for procuring food; environmental and financial impediments to that procurement; and aspiration for greater self-sufficiency and healthfulness in preparing food. Participants are intentional and skillful in resisting economic and environmental obstacles to feeding themselves. They want to be supported in building skills for that daily endeavor. The food agency scale does not gauge many of the strategies with which they resist obstacles, and therefore might be better cast as a cooking action scale, rather than a measure of comprehensive food agency...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundMany {{barriers}} to cervical cancer screening for Hispanic {{women have been}} documented, but few effective interventions exist. The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends increasing cervical cancer screening through various methods. Building on this evidence, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded the research and testing phases for an evidence-based and theoretically grounded intervention designed to increase cervical cancer screening among never and rarely screened Hispanic women of Mexican descent. In this article, we describe the development process of the AMIGAS (Ayudando a las Mujeres con Informaci 33 n, Gu 3, y Amor para su Salud) intervention, highlight the integration of scientific evidence and community-based participatory research principles, and identify opportunities for dissemination, adaptation, and implementation of this intervention. MethodsThe AMIGAS team was a collaboration among researchers, promotoras (community health workers), and program administrators. The multiyear, <b>multiphase</b> <b>project</b> was conducted in Houston, Texas; El Paso, Texas; and Yakima, Washington. The team completed several rounds of formative research, designed intervention materials and methodology, conducted a randomized controlled trial, created a guide for program administrators, and developed an intervention dissemination plan. ResultsTrial results demonstrated that AMIGAS was successful in increasing cervical cancer screening among Hispanic women. Adaptation of AMIGAS showed minimal reduction of outcomes. Dissemination efforts are underway to make AMIGAS available in a downloadable format via the Internet. ConclusionsDeveloping a community-based intervention that is evidence-based and theoretically grounded is challenging, time-intensive, and requires collaboration among multiple disciplines. Inclusion of key stakeholders 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 din particular program deliverers and administrators 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 dand planning for dissemination and translation to practice are integral components of successful intervention design. By providing explicit directions for adaptation for program deliverers, relevant information for program administrators, {{and access to the}} intervention via the Internet, AMIGAS is available to help increase cervical cancer screening among Hispanic women and other women disproportionately affected by cervical cancer. 200 - 2002 - 00573 /PHS HHS/United States 200 - 2008 - 27956 /PHS HHS/United States 200 - 98 - 0102 /PHS HHS/United StatesCC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United StatesS 1166 - 19 / 21 /PHS HHS/United StatesU 48 -DP 000057 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States 2015 - 10 - 13 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 23930983 PMC 460353...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} an {{appendix}} to the Hawaii WindHUI {{efforts to develop}} and operationalize short-term wind forecasting and wind ramp event forecasting capabilities. The report summarizes the WindNET Phase 1 efforts on the Big Island of Hawaii and includes descriptions of modeling methodologies, use of field validation data, results and recommendations. The objective of the WindNET project {{was to investigate the}} improvement that could be obtained in short-term wind power forecasting for wind generation facilities operating on the island grids operated by Hawaiian Electric Companies through the use of atmospheric sensors deployed at targeted locations. WindNET is envisioned as a <b>multiphase</b> <b>project</b> that will address the short-term wind forecasting issues of all of the wind generation facilities on the all of the Hawaiian Electric Companies' island grid systems. The first phase of the WindNET effort (referred to as WindNET- 1) was focused on the wind generation facilities on the Big Island of Hawaii. With complex terrain and marine environment, emphasis was on improving the 0 to 6 hour forecasts of wind power ramps and periods of wind variability, with a particular interest in the intra-hour (0 - 1 hour) look-ahead period. The WindNET project was built upon a foundation that was constructed with the results from a previously completed observation targeting study for the Big Island that was conducted as part of a project supported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and interactions with the western utilities. The observational targeting study provided guidance on which variables to measure and at what locations to get the most improvement in forecast performance at a target forecast site. The recommendations of the observation targeting study were based on the application two techniques: (1) an objective method called ensemble sensitivity analysis (ESA) (Ancell and Hakim, 2007; Torn and Hakim, 2008; Zack et al, 2010); and (2) a subjective method based on a diagnostic analysis of large ramp events. The analysis was completed for both the wind farm on the southern tip of the Big Island and on the northern tip of the island. The WindNET project was designed to also deploy sensors to validate the Big Island observational targeting study and enhance operator's understanding of predominate causes of wind variability conditions at the wind facilities. Compromises had to be made with the results from the observation targeting study to accommodate project resource limitations, availability of suitable sites, and other factors. To focus efforts, field sensor deployment activities focused on the wind facility on the southern point of Big Island...|$|E
40|$|Project W- 314, (97 -D- 402) Tank Farm Restoration and Safe Operations is a multi-year, <b>multiphase</b> <b>project</b> {{established}} to upgrade selected 200 East and West Area Tank Farms {{to support the}} long-term mission of waste storage, retrieval, and transfer for vitrification. Key drivers for these upgrades include the planned timetable for transfer of waste to the privatized vitrification facility, regulatory compliance requirements (i. e., Washington State and Federal Regulations), and the Tri-Party Agreement (TPA). The previous baseline scope for Project W- 314 was established based upon tank farm system assessments performed five to six years ago and {{was reflected in the}} previous baseline cost estimate, the Accelerated Replanning Estimate, completed in July 1997. The Accelerated Replanning Estimate splits the project into two phases: Phase 1 provides upgrades necessary to assure reliable waste retrieval and transfer to the anticipated vitrification plant. Phase 2 provides upgrades to selected primary and annulus tank farm ventilation systems that are required for compliant waste transfer, as well as other compliance-based upgrades to existing River Protection Project (WP) facilities and systems. The Accelerated Replanning Estimate provided the basis for Baseline Change Request TWR 97 - 066, which identified Phases 1 and 2 as $ 95 million and $ 206. 5 million, respectively. Following completion of the Accelerated Replanning Estimate, several changes occurred that prompted a decision to rebaseline Phase 1, and subsequently Phase 2. Paramount among these was the delay in the Privatization schedule (90 % case), lessons learned (in the year since the Accelerated Planning Report had been completed), and the adoption of an alternate waste transfer system route. The rebaselined cost of phase 1, $ 157 million, was substantially higher than the Accelerated Replanning Estimate {{for a number of reasons}} more thoroughly discussed in the Phase 1 Rebaseline Report, HNF- 3781, January 1999. Since the July 1997 Accelerated Replanning Estimate there have also been changes to the tank farm authorization basis and Programmatic needs. For example, Tank Farm Operations has been installing new Continuous Air Monitors (CAMS) and liquid level measuring devices in order to achieve desired monitoring improvements years earlier than provided by Phase 2. In summary, the decision to rebaseline Phase 2 was prompted by: (1) the shifting of selected Phase 2 scope to Phase 1 during the Phase 1 rebaselining, (2) changes in the authorization basis, (3) programmatic needs, and (4) the dated nature of the existing scope definition. Figure 1. 1 presents a summary of the key changes born the previous baseline and their collective impact on the cost of Phase 2...|$|E
