40|$|The {{presence}} of methane-bearing shallow sediments in the Adriatic Sea {{has been known}} since the fifties, but {{little is known about}} the benthic foraminiferal assemblages associated with them. One seep and two control cores were collected in the Bonaccia field (central Adriatic Sea) at a water depth of 80 m to investigate the possible influence of the release of gas from marine reservoirs on these foraminiferal assemblages. The seep core was drilled inside a pockmark in the vicinity of an active mud-volcano. Two control cores were collected in nearby areas unaffected by {{presence of}} methane. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages from the seep core are comparable to those from the seep-free cores and are composed of species common in the central Adriatic Sea. However, foraminiferal density in the seep-core is remarkably lower than in the control ones cores. Besides, calcitic foraminiferal tests from the seep core revealed unusual trends in stable carbon isotope composition. Even though not within the same range, a similar trend was observed throughout the seep core for the ä 13 C values of Gavelinopsis lobatulus, Cassidulina carinata, and Bulimina marinata. In particular, negative carbon isotope values were recorded for Gavelinopsis lobatulus at the top of the core where methane seeps were detected and deep inside the core sediments (50 cm). These findings seem to point to temporal variations in seep activity, proving that the ä 13 C values of foraminiferal tests reflect hydrocarbon release and may hence be used to reconstruct seep activity history.

40|$|Background: Telephone surveys {{based on}} samples of {{landline}} telephone numbers {{are widely used}} to measure the prevalence of health risk behaviours such as smoking, drug use and alcohol consumption. An increasing number of households are relying solely on mobile telephones, creating a potential bias for population estimates derived from landline-based sampling frames which do not incorporate mobile phone numbers. Studies in the US have identified significant differences between landline and mobile telephone users in smoking and alcohol consumption, but there has been little work in other settings or focussed on illicit drugs. Methods: This study examined Australian prevalence estimates of cannabis use, tobacco smoking and risky alcohol consumption based on samples selected using a dual-frame (mobile and landline) approach. Respondents from the landline sample were compared both to the overall <b>mobile</b> <b>sample</b> (including respondents who had access to a landline) and specifically to respondents who lived in mobile-only households. Bivariate comparisons were complemented with multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for the effects of basic demographic variables. Results: The landline sample reported much lower prevalence of tobacco use, cannabis use and alcohol consumption than the <b>mobile</b> <b>samples.</b> Once demographic variables were adjusted for, {{there were no significant differences}} between the landline and mobile respondents on any of the alcohol measures examined. In contrast, the <b>mobile</b> <b>samples</b> had significantly higher rates of cannabis and tobacco use, even after adjustment. Weighted estimates from the dual-frame sample were generally higher than the landline sample across all substances, but only significantly higher for tobacco use. Conclusions: Landline telephone surveys in Australia are likely to substantially underestimate the prevalence of tobacco smoking by excluding potential respondents who live in mobile-only households. In contrast, estimates of alcohol consumption and cannabis use from landline surveys are likely to be broadly accurate, once basic demographic weighting is undertaken...|$|R

40|$|New {{astronomy}} projects generate observation images continuously {{and these}} images are converted into tabular catalogs online. Furthermore, each such new <b>table,</b> called a <b>sample</b> <b>table,</b> is compared against a reference table on the same patch of sky to annotate the stars that match those in the reference and to identify transient objects that have no matches. This cross match must be done within {{a few seconds to}} enable timely issuance of alerts as well as shipping of the data products off the pipeline. To perform the online cross match of tables on celestial objects, we propose two parallel algorithms, zoneMatch and gridMatch, both of which divide up celestial objects by their locations in the spherical coordinate system. Specifically, zoneMatch divides the observation area by the declination coordinate of the celestial sphere whereas gridMatch utilizes a two-dimensional grid on the declination and the right ascension. With the reference table indexed by zones or grid, we match the stars in the <b>sample</b> <b>table</b> through parallel index probes on the reference. We implemented these algorithms on a multicore CPU as well as a desktop GPU, and evaluated their performance on both synthetic data and realworld astronomical data. Our results show that gridMatch is faster than zoneMatch at the cost of memory space and that parallelization achieves speedups of orders of magnitude.
