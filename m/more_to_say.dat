Its remarks on Genius are fresh, though tantalizing in their brevity, and it defends the Moderns with both neatness and energy. Much of its advice is cautious and commonplace—but {{such was the}} tradition of the poetical treatise on verse. Appearing within two years of Collier's first attack upon the stage, it reinforces some of that worthy's contentions, but we are not aware of its having had much effect.|$|E

[...] At the Las Vegas debate Biden seemed to attack all his opponents when he stated, [...] "I know there's <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> Campbell.

She said that they had deceived the court by not telling about her reluctance to share her thoughts with them. [...] She insisted that the ministers testify under oath, which they were very hesitant to do. [...] Magistrate Simon Bradstreet said that [...] "she would make the ministers sin if they said something mistaken under oath", but she answered that if they were going to accuse her, [...] "I desire it may be upon oath."

500|$|In later years, Voorhis had <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{about the}} reasons for his defeat.

[...] In November 1962, after Nixon's defeat in the California gubernatorial race, Voorhis appeared on Howard K. Smith's [...] program on ABC in the episode entitled [...] "The Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon" [...] and complained about the way Nixon had conducted himself in the 1946 race. [...] Voorhis's appearance was overshadowed by the controversial participation of Nixon adversary Alger Hiss. [...] In 1972, Voorhis authored a book, The Strange Case of Richard Milhous Nixon, in which he stated that Nixon was [...] "quite a ruthless opponent" [...] whose [...] "one cardinal and unbreakable rule of conduct" [...] was [...] "to win, whatever it takes to do it".

500|$|Ratajkowski {{says that}} she enjoys freedom of sexual {{expression}} [...] "while still being a feminist", and is outspoken about using her celebrity to support the empowerment of women and women's sexuality. Amanda Hess of Slate questioned whether she is a feminist or an opportunist exploiting feminism. In The New York Times, Ratajkowski expressed her frustration that [...] "society somehow feels that women can't manage to be political, feminist and a sex symbol". She has called society's reaction to the naked female form [...] "weird". As a woman who enjoys expressions of the body ranging from ballet to pornography, Ratajkowski feels that she can be nude in her professional work and also support equality for women. British GQ Charlie Burton stated {{that she is a}} feminist with <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> than others. He said that her message is one of sexual empowerment, because sex should not feel like a service and should be beneficial to all involved parties. Wolf said Ratajkowski is a modern feminist in a Harper's Bazaar interview of Ratajkowski, in which Ratajkowski defended her form of feminism.|$|E

Written in the key of E minor, the track is set in common time at a moderate tempo of 70 beats per minute. [...] Lyrically, [...] "DNA" [...] uses scientific vocabulary to portray themes of love and obsession. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman wrote that the song lionises a strong man. 4Music's Trent Maynard said that it paints a moody picture of love and deep seated biological compatibility. The chorus includes the lyrics, [...] "It's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA / It's in his DNA / And he just takes my breath away, b-b-b-breath away / I feel it every day / And that's what makes a man, not hard to understand / Perfect in every way, I see it in-his-face / Nothing <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> it's in his D-D-D-D-DNA". Leigh-Anne Pinnock does the song's half-spoken half-rapped middle eight in a spooky tone, mentioning, [...] "It's all about his kiss, contaminates my lips, our energy connects, it's simple genetics, I'm the X to his Y". Music website, Popjustice, likened the song to British girl group, the Spice Girls, writing, [...] "'DNA' is the 'Say You'll Be There' to the 'Wannabe' of 'Wings'".|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{controversy}} of his game, Ledonne became an unwitting spokesman for the games industry, facing the medium's opponents in debates and forums. The furor resulting from Slamgate was called out by Ledonne and others in the media as a sign that video games had not yet outgrown the traditional stereotype of children's games. Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that despite being confused and tawdry, Super Columbine Massacre [...] "symbolizes a growing understanding that videogames have <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> than 'shoot the enemies and pick up health.'" [...] Authors Andreas Jahn-Sudmann and Ralf Stockmann consider controversial video games such as Super Columbine Massacre and the Grand Theft Auto [...] "Hot coffee mod" [...] evidence of sociopolitical tensions present between gamers and older generations. The game and others like it continue to {{be at the center of}} the video games as art debate, and Gamasutra credited Super Columbine Massacre and Slamgate as having two highly positive and far-reaching effects; first, forcing print game journalism to focus on the issue; and second, the [...] "evangelization of the notion that games can be as meaningful and important as other media, even if the example is offensive to the sensibilities of most Americans [...] To win is to lose, but to play is to experience an enrichment that cannot be scored." ...|$|E

[...] Eusebius McKaiser, a radio talk show host and former Mckinsey employee said, of Bartons' statement in an article headlined [...] "Why Mckinsey is not Innocent", that [...] "I sometimes wonder whether corporations think we are a bunch of fools incapable of seeing excrement for what it is."

[...] The Financial Mail, a weekly financial magazine, published an editorial strap-lined [...] "McKinsey's tone deaf fudge" [...] entitled [...] "McKinsey: Would I lie to you?" [...] describing the list of excuses provided by Barton in his statement as improbable and that the statement did not go nearly far enough to explain how Mckinsey and Trillian earned R1.6bn in 6 months without a lawful contract. [...] The article went on to describe Mckinsey's behaviour as being, if not corruption, then certainly greed and profiteering.|$|E

IGN called the show {{a prime example of}} the [...] "sophisticated, intelligent brand of children's programming" [...] during Nickelodeon's golden age. The A.V.

[...] New York compared the series' humor, in retrospect, to that of Office Space (1999) and praised the subversive, anti-corporate stories.|$|E

Bart said of the album, [...] "We recorded a demo which was released as an EP on cassette last year. The reaction was very positive. We were still searching for direction at that time, experimenting with keyboards and femme vox. The music is much more focused now as we have found our sound.

I think we had <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> as musicians this time in the studio as well. Our objective was to keep the aggression and not to loose our edge.
