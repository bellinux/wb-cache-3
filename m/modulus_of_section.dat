40|$|Analysis and Experiment were {{undertaken}} on {{the change}} of the resistance from material accompanying {{the progress of the}} fracture surface in the impulsive bending test of a pre-fatigued carbon steel in low temperatures. The S 35 C carbon steel was tested by the Chalpy impulse testing machine， for five pre-fatigue levels between 0 and 10 ^ 5 cycles and also five impulse testing temperature levels between　十 30 and　− 90 ℃. 　The impulsive resisting energy per a unit area （abbreviated by lREU hereafter）of the total fracture surface of pre-fatigued specimens was denoted by u and that of nonpre- fatigued ones by u_ 0. For distinction between the IREU of the fracture surface of the pre-fatigued zone and that of the non-pre-fatigued one in one total fracture surface，IREU proportional to the former and to the latter were respectively denoted　v and v_ 0. The change of the impulsive resisting force along with the progress of the impulsive fracture （abbreviated by CIRF hereafter）was observed by the synchroscope. 　　 1 ）CIRF seemed to be influenced by the stress concentration {{at the front of the}} progressing fracture surface，the slope of u value from the bottom of the notch to the interior of the specimen and {{the change of}} the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>section</b> of the not-yet fractured part. 　　 2 ）The more pre-fatigued and the lower the tested temperature， the less u. 　For the same pre-fatigue level u/u_ 0 lessened along with the lowering of the temperature， reached the minimum value about the ductility transition temperature and began to increase thereafter. 　　 3 ）v/v_ 0 was constantly about 0. 13 　for any pre-fatigue and the test temperature.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for flexural <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> laminated composites derived from the analysis of a flexural-section composed of several ductile and brittle layers of different moduli. The derivation {{is based on the}} assumption that the tension and compression zones of the laminated composite are symmetrical with respect to the neutral axis and thus, half <b>of</b> the <b>section</b> is needed to analyze for complete derivation <b>of</b> flexural <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> the whole <b>section.</b> This composed <b>of</b> two ductile layers of higher moduli providing in both tension and compression zones to maintain the equilibrium conditions during flexure.

It is concluded that this factor is different from the usual one which is obtained under uniaxial loadings. Despite the fragile nature of brittle layers of the composite, it has been found that the inclusion of two ductile layers into the laminated cementitious composites makes it fully ductile material owing to the synergetic action between the layers of two components...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{propagation}} of cracks along {{the span of}} the reinforced concrete structures results in a reduction of structural stiffness. The Indonesia National Code SNI 2847 - 2002, which refers to the ACI 318 M- 2008, mandates the reduction of this moment of inertia by 35 %. This reduction-number is generalized for all the reinforcement ratios. As a consequence, this {{will lead to a}} deviation in actual behaviour, since a dissimilar reinforcement ratio will result in a different stiffness <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> the <b>section</b> under consideration. A non-linear Finite Element Model (FEM) based on the anisotropic material approach, is currently being developed to generate the relationship of the flexural rigidity factor {{as a function of the}} reinforcement ratio...|$|R

Although a medial axis/surface {{may appear to be}} similar to the corresponding mid-surface of the solid, it stores information regarding the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> the <b>section.</b> Based on this feature of medial axes, an innovative and computationally inexpensive solidification interpolation method is proposed in this paper. The method offers a compromise solution between traditional numerical methods and the geometry driven Section Modulus methods. Even though the proposed method may not be as accurate as traditional numerical methods, it gives a rapid “feel” of the design to its creator during the interrogation stage. The solidification results are compared with a Finite Element simulation as well as the simple Section Modulus method. The potential benefits of this technique can be realised during an optimisation cycle where repetitive calculations are needed even for small design changes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{consider}} the application of discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods, defined on agglomerated meshes consisting of general polytopic elements, to the numerical approximation of partial differential equation problems posed on complicated geometries. Here, {{we assume that the}} underlying computational domain may be accurately represented by a geometry-conforming fine mesh; the resulting coarse mesh is then constructed based on employing standard graph partitioning algorithms. To improve the accuracy of the computed numerical approximation, we consider the development of goal-oriented adaptation techniques within an automatic mesh refinement strategy. In this setting, elements marked for refinement are subdivided by locally constructing finer agglomerates; should further resolution of the underlying fine mesh T_f be required, then adaptive refinement of T_f will also be undertaken. As an example of the application of these techniques, we consider the numerical approximation of the linear elasticity equations for a homogeneous isotropic material. In particular, the performance of the proposed adaptive refinement algorithm is studied for the computation of the (scaled) effective Young's <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> a <b>section</b> <b>of</b> trabecular bone...|$|R

30|$|The {{notion of}} {{asymptotic}} pointwise contractions {{was introduced in}} [6]. Then it was also studied in [7] where, by means of ultrapower techniques, different results {{about the existence of}} fixed points and convergence of iterates were proved. In [8] new proofs were presented but this time after applying only elementary techniques. Very recently, in [1], these techniques were applied in CAT(0), where the authors attend to the Bruhat-Tits inequality for CAT(0) spaces in order to obtain such results. In the present paper we show that actually most of those results still hold for general uniformly convex metric spaces under mild conditions on the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> convexity. In <b>Section</b> 3 we focus on single-valued mappings and, in particular, on mappings which are asymptotically pointwise contractive/nonexpansive to study the existence of fixed points, convergence of Picard's iterates, and the structure of their sets of fixed points. As a technical result we need to show that bounded sequences in these spaces have a unique asymptotic center which, as a by-product, leads to Kirk's Fixed Point Theorem. In Section 4 we study different problems regarding set-valued mappings in these spaces. The main technical difficulty to achieve similar results to those shown in [1] is that now we cannot count on the existence of fixed points for nonexpansive set-valued mappings for the kind of spaces we deal with. Finding fixed point for set-valued nonexpansive mappings in uniformly convex metric spaces was first studied by Shimizu and Takahashi [9], where the existence of fixed points was guaranteed under stronger conditions on the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> convexity and the additional condition of metric convexity of the space. The fact {{that we do not have}} that the metric are convex will make the problem more complicated and this will take us to impose new conditions on the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> convexity which we will relate with the geometry of the space.|$|R

For this reason, methods must be found for the utilization of wood ash. One solution is {{to use it as}} a stabilizing material in forest roads. The pozzolanic characteristic of ash is used to bind the gravel in the road base. Wood ash is expected to reduce the need for gravel on forest roads and at the same time to enhance the load bearing capacity of forest roads. Two different untreated wood ashes were used in two mixture ratios, each on a 50 meter long forest road section, to investigate the load bearing capacity. The ashes were selected by their different properties: high lime and low heavy metal content, production of ashes in Austrian biomass power plants with various furnace technologies and disposal costs. Mixing depth was 0. 50 m and the road base was covered by a 0. 10 m thick surface layer.
