Muscle growth in the neonatal period may be very sensitive to variations in early nutrition, but {{little is known about}} long-term effects of infant feeding on muscle strength. Methods. In 2, 983 community-dwelling older men and women born 1931 - 1939, we examined the relationship between their type of <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> in infancy and their muscle strength in adult life. Information about <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> for each participant was abstracted from their infant record; grip strength was measured using a Jamar dynamometer. Results. Sixty percent (1, 783) of the participants were breastfed only, 31 % (926) were breast-and bottle-fed, and 9 % (274) were bottle-fed only. There were no differences in type of <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> between men and women or according to social class at birth. Among the men studied, grip strength was related to the type of <b>milk</b> <b>feeding,</b> such that greater exposure to breast milk in infancy was associated with greater grip strength in adult life (p =. 023). This association remained after adjustment for the effects of a range of confounding influences (birthweight, infant growth, height, age at measurement, adult diet, and level of physical activity). In contrast, the type of <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> in infancy was not related to grip strength among the women studied (p =. 807). Conclusions.

40|$|In Mediterranean environments, forage {{production}} for livestock is both difficult and costly due to erratic rainfall. As an alternative, barley, oat and triticale {{can be used}} as dual-purpose autumn-sown cereals, thus serving as winter grazing and grain for feed. The present study was aimed at estimating the influence of different management systems (dual-purpose with one and two grazings, soft-dough harvest for silage, full maturity grain only) on grain yield, forage and whole plant production, and on quality-related traits of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and oat (Avena sativa L.). The trials were conducted over 2 years (1998 / 1999 and 1999 / 2000) in a Southern Italy Mediterranean environment using a flock of sheep for grazing and mechanically clipping the plots, thus simulating the dual-purpose, to obtain forage samples for analyses. Effect of the years was not significant, whereas both crops underwent significant reductions of grain yield, harvest index, thousand kernel weight and seeds/m(2) in the dual-purpose plots but not in the grain only plots. The most drastic yield reduction was recorded in oat after two grazings by comparison to the ungrazed treatment (2. 4 t/ha versus 3. 9 t/ha). Grain protein content was not affected by dual-purpose in oat, and it was independent of the number of grazings in barley. Barley had a higher production of total biomass and <b>milk</b> <b>feed</b> units than oat in the dual-purpose management systems, except for the soft-dough and grain only treatments. In addition, barley reacted positively to both the dual-purpose systems (one and two grazings). More specifically, whole plant biomass increased from 9. 6 t/ha when grown for grain only to 13. 6 t/ha in the single grazing system, and <b>milk</b> <b>feed</b> units similarly increased, from 7680 to 9216 MFU/ha. Green forage quality was comparable between the two cereals, even though barley whole plants showed lower fibre content, especially after two grazings. The soft-dough stage of both crops had better forage quality parameters, nevertheless, the lower biomass yields and total <b>milk</b> <b>feed</b> units (in the case of barley) rendered this system non-profitable for the environment studied. Barley demonstrated a clear superiority for the dual-purpose systems in Mediterranean Italy and should thus be preferred to oat, except when using oat to interrupt barley monocropping.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{absorption}} and utilisation {{of dietary}} fat as an energy supplement was studied in 15 healthy preterm infants. They were given two formulae for periods of one week. The standard low solute feed supplied 6 g fat and 476 kJ (114 cal) per kg. The {{high energy feed}} supplied 10 g of the same fat and 623 kJ (149 cal) per kg. Fat supplementation resulted in increased absorption (signi-ficantly higher chylomicron levels) without steatorrhoea or metabolic disturbance, apparently unchanged differential absorption of fatty acids, and a significantly higher rate ofweight gain (mean 25 9 ± 4 6 compared with 20 - 3 ± 4. 4 g/ 24 h). A high energy formula prepared with supplements of complex dietary fat is therefore of potential value in ensuring the adequate nutrition and growth of preterm infants. The gastrointestinal energy losses of preterm infants are high 1 and increase the already consider-able energy requirements for growth which, if not met, may place infants at risk from malnutrition.

Feeding cues were identified using a validated list of communication cues (NCAST). The frequency of each cue during the beginning, middle, {{and end of the}} meal was recorded. There were 22 feeding cues identified during the feeds, with significantly more frequent disengagement cues expressed than engagement cues.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} {{association}} between duration of breast <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> and cognitive ability at 7 - 8 years in a birth cohort of very low birthweight infants.  DESIGN— 280 survivors from a national birth cohort of 413 New Zealand very low birthweight infants born in 1986 were assessed at age 7 - 8 years on measures of verbal and performance intelligence quotient (IQ) using the WISC-R. At the same time mothers were questioned {{as to whether they}} had elected to provide expressed breast milk at birth and the total duration of breast <b>milk</b> <b>feeding.</b>  RESULTS—Some 73 % of mothers provided expressed breast milk and 37 % breast fed for four months or longer. Increasing duration of breast <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> was associated with increases in both verbal IQ (p < 0. 001) and performance IQ (p < 0. 05) : children breast fed for eight months or longer had mean (SD) verbal IQ scores that were 10. 2 (0. 56) points higher and performance IQ scores that were 6. 2 (0. 35) points higher than children who did not receive breast milk.

When data from individual infants were examined a possible temporal relation between the occurrence of GOR and central apnoea was seen in only two infants; in each case, detailed examination suggested that apnoea was more closely associated with sleep than with GOR.

40|$|Membrane {{distillation}} is {{an emerging}} technology to concentrate liquid products while producing high quality water as permeate.

Water vapour migrates from the <b>milk</b> <b>feed</b> side to the permeate side by the vapour pressure {{difference between the two}} sides of a hydrophobic membrane. Unlike pressure driven membrane filtration high solid concentrations are achievable. Experimental results show that concentrations of 50 % total solids can be achieved for milk, which makes membrane distillation a competitor to evaporation. In experiments for skimmed milk, ranging from 40 to 60 °C, the flux was found to increase with higher feed temperatures. For skimmed milk with 25 % total solids, at 60 °C an initial flux of around 16 kg/m 2 per hour was achieved. Due to gradual fouling built the flux declined to 8 kg/m 2 per hour after 15 hours. At concentrations of 50 % total solids the flux declined to 3 kg/m 2 per hour. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to investigate the size and morphology of the fouling layer. Images indicated homogeneous fouling layers with a thickness depending on the process temperature; lower temperature resulted in thinner fouling layer. Most plausible reason is the lower driving force and transmembrane flux. These lab scale experiments showed promising fluxes, which still can be improved, that are a good starting point for the development of large scale production units...|$|E

Apparent digestibility values and statistical differences (A,B: P< 0. 01) for OM were: 69. 7 A% (P 23), 76. 2 B% (P 48) and 67. 5 A% (S), for crude protein: 70. 9 % (P 23), 74. 7 % (P 48) and 74. 3 % (S). A positive nitrogen balance was observed with the following values: 2. 8 g/d (F 20), 3. 8 g/d (F 38) and 3. 8 g/d (S). Nutritive value of diets was: 0, 74 A (F 20), 0, 83 B (F 38) and 0, 71 A (S) French <b>Milk</b> <b>Feed</b> Unit/kg.

40|$|The {{rate and}} extent of {{estimated}} energy mobilization {{and the relationship between}} fat depth at the rib and thurl and body condition score (BCS) were investigated in Jersey and Holstein cows in early lactation. Twenty-six cows were paired by breed, parity, and calving date, and were individually fed a total mixed ration ad libi-tum from parturition through 120 d in <b>milk.</b> <b>Feed</b> intake and milk production were measured daily; body weight (BW), BCS, subcutaneous fat depth, milk composition, and concentration of plasma nonesterified fatty acids were measured every 2 wk. Estimated tissue energy balance (TEB) was calculated using 1989 NRC equa-tions. Net energy intake was greater in early lactation for Holsteins compared with Jerseys, 37. 8 and 28. 2 Mcal/d, respectively. Milk energy was greater for Hol-steins relative to Jerseys, 30. 5 versus 21. 2 Mcal/d. Fat depth and BCS did not differ between breeds. A positive relationship existed between fat depth and BCS for Jerseys; however, there was no significant relationship for Holsteins. The best-fit regression model for pre-dicting TEB for Holsteins and Jerseys in early lactation included week of lactation, milk composition, and BCS. Jerseys remained in negative TEB for a shorter period of time relative to Holsteins. The TEB nadir was − 6. 19 and − 12. 9 Mcal/d, for Jerseys and Holsteins, respec-tively. Expressed as a proportion of metabolic BW (BW 0. 75), net energy intake did not differ between breeds, yet milk energy and estimated tissue energy loss were greater for Holsteins compared with Jerseys.

40|$|Summary: Thirty-six {{neonates}} {{were randomly}} assigned to 2 groups of 18 neonates each. In the pacifier group, infants were given a pacifier before <b>milk</b> <b>feeding.</b> Newborns in the control group were fed without preprandial use of a pacifier. Doppler measurement of peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, and Pourcelot resistance index in the superior mesenteric artery was performed in both groups. Peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities were significantly increased after pacifier suck-ing in the preprandial stage. The resistance index decreased significantly after <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> but not after pacifier sucking. The feeding volume was not affected by preprandial pacifier sucking.
