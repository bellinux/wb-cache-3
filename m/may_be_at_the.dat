5|$|When {{copulation}} takes place, {{the male}} butterfly or moth places a capsule of sperm (spermatophore) in a receptacle {{of the female}} (called the corpus bursae). The sperm, when released from the capsule, swims directly into or via a small tube into a special seminal receptacle (spermatheca), where the sperm is stored until it is released into the vagina for fertilisation during egg laying, which may occur hours, days, or months after mating. The eggs pass through the ovipore. The ovipore <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of a modified ovipositor or surrounded {{by a pair of}} broad setose anal papillae.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} player's turn batting or plate {{appearance is}} complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball {{that results in}} the team's third out, {{even if it is}} recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to dualism, monism {{does not accept}} any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia. In Indian and Chinese philosophy, monism is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are physicalist. Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science. However, a variety of formulations (see below) are possible. Another form of monism, idealism, states that the only existing substance is mental. Although pure idealism, {{such as that of}} George Berkeley, is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called panpsychism, according to which mental experience and properties <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and David Ray Griffin.|$|E

25|$|Most spiders do {{not cause}} bites {{that are of}} importance. For a bite to be significant, {{substantial}} envenomation is required. Bites from the widow spiders involve a neurotoxic venom which produces a condition known as latrodectism. Symptoms may include: pain which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bite or involve the chest and abdomen, sweating, muscle cramps and vomiting among others. Bites from the recluse spiders cause the condition loxoscelism, in which local necrosis of the surrounding skin and widespread breakdown of red blood cells may occur. Headaches, vomiting and a mild fever may also occur. Other spiders that can cause significant bites include: the Australian funnel-web spider and South American wandering spider.|$|E

2500|$|In other dialogues, the Sophist, Statesman, Republic, and the Parmenides, Plato himself {{associates}} {{knowledge with}} the apprehension of unchanging Forms and their relationships {{to one another}} (which he calls [...] "expertise" [...] in Dialectic), including through the processes of collection and division. More explicitly, Plato himself argues in the Timaeus that knowledge is always proportionate to the realm from which it is gained. In other words, if one derives one's account of something experientially, because the world of sense is in flux, the views therein attained will be mere opinions. And opinions are characterized {{by a lack of}} necessity and stability. On the other hand, if one derives one's account of something by way of the non-sensible forms, because these forms are unchanging, so too is the account derived from them. That apprehension of forms is required for knowledge may be taken to cohere with Plato's theory in the Theaetetus and Meno. Indeed, the apprehension of Forms <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of the [...] "account" [...] required for justification, in that it offers foundational knowledge which itself needs no account, thereby avoiding an infinite regression.|$|E
2500|$|Members of the Royal Family, {{including}} the sovereign, take on honorary appointments—known as royal appointments—related to army regiments or air force or navy units; {{a practice that}} {{is thought to have}} originated with the appointment of Princess Louise, Duchess of Connaught, as Colonel-in-Chief of the 199th Battalion in 1917. The appointment, intended as an honour for regiments and units and to reinforce loyalty to the Crown, is made by the Crown-in-Council (the monarch or the governor general acting on the advice of Cabinet) and the appointee—known as an honorary—acts akin to a patron and holds the role either for life or until voluntarily stepping down or the unit or regiment is disbanded. Positions include colonel-in-chief, captain general, commodore-in-chief, admiral, and others. Requests for a royal honorary are made by the reigment or unit through the chain of command and a holder is indended to be a [...] "guardian of Regimental traditions and history, promot the regiment's identity and ethos and [...] an advisor to the Commanding Officer on virtually all issues excluding operations." [...] They will carry out a number of associated duties, such as attending regimental dinners, presenting new colours, trooping the colour, and viewing field training exercises. Attendance and participation in these events <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> direction of the ministers of the Crown or the regiment itself.
