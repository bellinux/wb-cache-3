25|$|Ground system {{provision}} {{is the responsibility}} of either a participating ANSP or an aircraft operator. Aircraft operators often contract out the function to either DSP or to a separate service provider. Messages from aircraft, especially automatically generated ones, can be pre-configured according to <b>message</b> <b>type</b> so that they are automatically delivered to the appropriate recipient just as ground-originated messages can be configured to reach the correct aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{approach}} {{that can be}} used with some languages involves having different data structures, but all have the initial fields, including the next (and prev if double linked list) references in the same location. [...] After defining separate structures for each type of data, a generic structure can be defined that contains the minimum amount of data shared by all the other structures and contained at the top (beginning) of the structures. [...] Then generic routines can be created that use the minimal structure to perform linked list type operations, but separate routines can then handle the specific data. [...] This approach is often used in message parsing routines, where several types of messages are received, but all start with the same set of fields, usually including a field for <b>message</b> <b>type.</b> [...] The generic routines are used to add new messages to a queue when they are received, and remove them from the queue in order to process the message. [...] The <b>message</b> <b>type</b> field is then used to call the correct routine to process the specific type of message.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Agent {{communication}} languages (ACLs) invoke {{speech act}} theory and define individual <b>message</b> <b>types</b> {{by reference to}} particular combinations of beliefs and desires of the speaker (feasibility preconditions). Even when the mental states are restricted to a small set of nested beliefs, {{it seems that there}} might be a very large number of different possible preconditions, and therefore a very large number of different <b>message</b> <b>types.</b> With some constraints on the mental attitude of the speaker, we enumerate the possible belief states that could serve as preconditions for individual <b>message</b> <b>types,</b> and we identify how these states correspond to different possible <b>message</b> <b>types.</b> We then compare these with FIPA’s primitive <b>message</b> <b>types.</b> Our approach clarifies the nature of core <b>message</b> <b>types</b> in an ACL, and perhaps settles issues concerning just how many, and what types of, speech acts should be seen as primitive in such languages. ...|$|R
