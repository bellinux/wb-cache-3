5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a <b>magnesium</b> <b>alloy)</b> was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E

5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco <b>magnesium</b> <b>alloy</b> castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E

25|$|The M7A was an open-wheeled {{single-seater}} with a mid-mounted engine {{driving the}} rear wheels. The chassis was a bathtub-type (i.e. open-topped) monocoque made from 22-gauge aluminium alloy and 20-gauge <b>magnesium</b> <b>alloy</b> panels glued and riveted {{together and to}} three steel bulkheads. The monocoque terminated behind the driver's seat and the engine {{was used as a}} stressed part of the chassis, bolted directly to the rearmost bulkhead. The gearbox was then attached behind the engine, and the rear suspension – consisting of lateral top links, twin radius arms and reversed wishbones– attached to the gearbox and the rear bulkhead. The front suspension – upper and lower lateral links and radius arms – and the steering column were attached to the two bulkheads in front of the driver. Coilover springs and Koni dampers mounted outside of the body were employed front and rear.|$|E
25|$|From the {{inception}} of the design, priority was given to easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operating from forward airfields. To this end, the entire engine cowling was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle latches. A large panel under the wing centre section could be removed {{to gain access to the}} L-shaped main fuel tank, which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit bulkhead. Other, smaller panels gave easy access to the cooling system and electrical equipment. The engine was held in two large, forged, Elektron <b>magnesium</b> <b>alloy</b> Y-shaped legs, one per side straddling the engine block, which were cantilevered from the firewall. Each of the legs was secured by two quick-release screw fittings on the firewall. All of the main pipe connections were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and electrical equipment plugged into junction boxes mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes, a potential step to the eventual adoption of the unitized-powerplant Kraftei engine mounting concept used by many German combat aircraft designs, later in the war years.|$|E

However, the corrosion performance of most <b>magnesium</b> <b>alloys</b> {{is not good enough}} for the increasingly diverse practical applications. The Cooperative Research Centre for Cast Metals Manufacturing (CAST) is an Australian research organisation established to cope with the problems associated with development and application of light metals. Corrosion and prevention of <b>magnesium</b> and its <b>alloys</b> has been an important part of CAST’s research program since 1995.

In Formula One form by 1978 it delivered about 520bhp at 12,000rpm, about 50bhp more than the Cosworth DFV engines used by most teams, {{as well as a}} peak 324lb-ft of torque (439 N·m).

40|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>alloys</b> {{have been}} widely {{explored}} as potential biomaterials, but several limitations to using these materials have prevented their widespread use, such as uncontrollable degradation kinetics which alter their mechanical properties. In an attempt to further the applicability of <b>magnesium</b> and its <b>alloys</b> for biomedical purposes, two novel <b>magnesium</b> <b>alloys</b> Mg-Zn-Cu and Mg-Zn-Se were developed with the expectation of improving upon the unfavorable qualities shown by similar magnesium based materials that have previously been explored. The overall performance of these novel <b>magnesium</b> <b>alloys</b> has been assessesed in three distinct phases of research: 1) analysing the mechanical properties of the as-cast <b>magnesium</b> <b>alloys,</b> 2) evaluating the biocompatibility of the as-cast <b>magnesium</b> <b>alloys</b> {{through the use of}} in-vitro cellular studies, and 3) profiling the degradation kinetics of the as-cast <b>magnesium</b> <b>alloys</b> through the use of electrochemical potentiodynamic polarization techqnique as well as gravimetric weight-loss methods. As compared to currently available shape memory alloys and degradable as-cast alloys, these experimental alloys possess superior as-cast mechanical properties with elongation at failure values of 12 % and 13 % for the Mg-Zn-Se and Mg-Zn-Se alloys, respectively. This is substantially higher than other as-cast <b>magnesium</b> <b>alloys</b> that have elongation at failure values that range from 7 - 10 %. Biocompatibility tests revealed that both the Mg-Zn-Se and Mg-Zn-Cu alloys exhibit low cytotoxicity levels which are suitable for biomaterial applications. Gravimetric and electrochemical testing was indicative of the weight loss and initial corrosion behavior of the alloys once immersed within a simulated body fluid. The development of these novel as-cast <b>magnesium</b> <b>alloys</b> provide an advancement to the field of degradable metallic materials, while experimental results indicate their potential as cost-effective medical devices. ...|$|R

500|$|Experiments {{with the}} flame fougasse {{continued}} and it rapidly evolved. The fuel mixture {{was at first}} 40% petrol and 60% gas-oil, a mixture calculated to be useless as a vehicle fuel. A concoction of tar, lime, and petrol gel known as 5B was also developed. [...] "5B was dark coloured, sticky, smooth paste which burned fiercely for many minutes, stuck easily to anything with which it came in contact and did not flow on burning." [...] Early flame fougasse designs had a complex arrangement of explosive charges: a small one at the front to ignite the fuel and a main charge at the back to throw the fuel forward. An important discovery was that including <b>magnesium</b> <b>alloy</b> turnings (the waste product of machining magnesium pieces in a lathe) with the main charge {{at the rear of}} the barrel would give reliable ignition. This eliminated the need for a separate ignition charge and its associated wiring. The alloy of about 90% magnesium and 10% aluminium was, at the time, known under the trade name Elektron.|$|E
500|$|Against {{the trend}} {{set by the}} Lotus 21 in 1961, the BT19's suspension, which {{controls}} the relative motion of the chassis and the wheels, is outboard all round. That is, the bulky springs and dampers are mounted {{in the space between}} the wheels and the bodywork, where they interfere with the airflow and increase unwanted aerodynamic drag. Tauranac persisted with this apparently conservative approach based on wind tunnel tests he had carried out in the early 1960s, which indicated that a more complicated inboard design, with the springs and dampers concealed under the bodywork, would provide only a 2% improvement in drag. He judged the extra time needed to set up an inboard design at the racetrack to outweigh this small improvement. At the front the suspension consists of unequal length, non-parallel double wishbones. The front uprights, the solid components upon which the wheels and brakes are mounted, were modified from the Alford & Alder units used on the British Triumph Herald saloon. The rear suspension is formed by a single top link, a reversed lower wishbone and two radius rods locating cast <b>magnesium</b> <b>alloy</b> uprights. Wheels were initially 13inches (330mm) in diameter, but soon upgraded to [...] at the rear, and later still 15in at the front as well. These increases enabled the use of larger, more powerful brakes.
