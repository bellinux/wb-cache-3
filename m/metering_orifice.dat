50|$|A {{second problem}} with the {{conventional}} carburettor was its good performance in steady conditions, but poor progression: its dynamic ability to respond, such as when suddenly opening the throttle. This could give 'flat spots' in performance, or required great additional complexity to the carburettor such as multiple chokes, emulsion tubes and accelerator pumps. The Fish carburettor metered its fuel flow through a calibrated tapered groove, connected directly to the accelerator pedal and the throttle butterfly. The fuel <b>metering</b> <b>orifice</b> was controlled in immediate proportion to the throttle position, {{in a similar manner}} to the motorcycle slide carburettor. Between the float chamber and the venturi, an additional chamber, unique to the Fish design, contains the metering arm and groove. The arm is attached to the throttle spindle, moves with it, and is drilled with a hollow channel supplying fuel to the jets on the throttle spindle. This arm has an inlet hole at its end, which is a simple drilling and not of precise size. The hole passes over the metering groove, which is a radial arc in one wall of the chamber and it is the width of this groove which is precisely controlled, so as to accurately meter the fuel. As the throttle arm moves to the wide-throttle position, the arm sweeps across to the wider part of the groove, allowing more fuel to flow. The arm is close-fitting within the width of the chamber. As it moves, this close fit has the effect of a vane pump and acts as an accelerator pump to force additional fuel into the jet when the throttle is first opened.|$|E
40|$|Small engine carburetors {{have been}} used for over 100 years and their continual {{development}} has produced a mechanical device that although simple in principle is difficult to control in practice. This study aims to develop a mathematical model of the air and fuel delivery process that occurs in the idle path that can predict the air-to-fuel ratio in small engines. A one-dimensional model was created that incorporates single phase air and fuel flow effects using an electrical circuit analog. The model incorporates dynamic fuel flow effects due to inertia, and was coupled to the engine airflow via input data provided by commercial engine simulation software. The methodology developed for the idle path creates a foundation on which to build a transition system and the boundary conditions that control it. A simplified model of the main path circuit was also created that incorporates single phase inertial effects and was used to provide boundary conditions to the idle path model. Finally, a dynamic sensitivity analysis of the idle path was conducted to analyze which elements of the idle path control the fuel flow response. The second part of this study addressed the results of the sensitivity analysis. The idle discharge <b>metering</b> <b>orifice</b> has the largest effect on the air-to-fuel ratio delivered to the engine by the idle path. An experiment was created to characterize two-phase orifices representative of the idle discharge <b>metering</b> <b>orifice.</b> The data produces an empirical correlation {{that can be used to}} predict the pressure loss across the <b>metering</b> <b>orifice.</b> The correlation displays results that are inconsistent with the homogeneous assumption and highlights the need for further research in this area...|$|E

40|$|A {{new concept}} {{for the design}} of a {{residential}} oil burner is presented involving a low pressure, air atomizing nozzle. Advantages of this approach, relative to conventional, pressure atomized burners include: ability to operate at very low excess air levels without smoke, ability to operate at low (and possibly variable) rates, reduced boiler fouling, and low NO{sub x}. The nozzle used is a low pressure, airblast atomizer which can achieve fuel spray drop sizes similar to conventional nozzles and very good combustion performance with air pressure as low as 5 inches of water (1. 24 kPa). A burner head has been developed for this nozzle and combustion test results are presented {{in a wide variety of}} equipment including cast iron and steel boilers, warm air furnaces, and water heaters over the firing rate range 0. 25 gph to 1. 0 gph (10 to 41 kW). Beyond the nozzle and combustion head the burner system must be developed and two approaches have been taken. The first involves a small, brushless DC motor/fan combination which uses high fan speed to achieve air pressures from 7 to 9 inches of water (1. 74 to 2. 24 kPa). Fuel is delivered to the atomizer at less than 1 psig (6. 9 kPa) using a solenoid pump and flow <b>metering</b> <b>orifice.</b> At 0. 35 gph (14 kW) the electric power draw of this burner is less than 100 watts. In a second configuration a conventional motor is used with a single stage fan which develops 5 to 6 inches of water pressure (1. 24 to 1. 50 kPa) at similar firing rates. This burner uses a conventional type fuel pump and <b>metering</b> <b>orifice</b> to deliver fuel. The fuel pump is driven by the fan motor, very much like a conventional burner. This second configuration is seen as more attractive to the heating industry and is now being commercialized.

40|$|When {{flow through}} a {{hypersonic}} blowdown tunnel is {{initiated by the}} bursting of a diaphragm, expansion of the process gas into the downstream vacuum of the facility creates a strong rarefaction wave.

By examining the three methods in conjunction, tradeoffs between complexity and physical accuracy can be analyzed. Ultimately, this study shall lead to the design of an experiment to verify the accuracy of the three methods...|$|E
