[...] He realized that in getting an education archaeologists, “…spend much of their time learning phonemics, personality and culture, esoteric kinship systems, strange customs of primitive peoples, and so forth and do not have time for fields like botany, zoology, pollen analysis, soils, and geology – all disciplines they will have to use”. [...] In order to rectify this, MacNeish began to involve experts outside of archaeology in many of his field studies.

Monographs on The Hague, Gouda, Leiden, Nijmegen, Tilburg and Zwolle are recent examples. Five of these were written by a team of authors, although the book on Zwolle was the work of only one historian, as in the old days. Although these books differ too much to constitute a ‘standard format’, as advocated by urban historian Pim Kooij, they are comparable enough to provide insights into parallel developments. The integration of new disciplines such as urban archaeology has been extraordinarily fruitful. The continuous publication of urban histories helps to further accentuate the image of the Dutch past, particularly its local diversity. </p...|$|R

40|$|There is much {{merit in}} {{limiting}} one’s projects to a scale {{at which they}} might ac-tually be completed. Mathematics, and Ba-nach space theory in particular, has any number of <b>multi-volume</b> <b>publications</b> where the authors and/or the publishers ran out of steam before providing the details enticingly promised in Volume 1. In the case of Ba-nach space theory, such problems were often intimately connected to the perceived lack of momentum in the subject in the 1970 s and 1980 s. Fortunately (at least {{for those of us}} who work in this area), the prepara-tion of obituaries was a little premature and much deep and interesting research contin-ues to be done. I am pleased to say that the Handbook of the Geometry of Banach Spaces project has not at all suffered from any loss of mo-mentum.

Soc. Gazette 30 (2003), 168 – 169.) The style of the Handbook is to provide carefully written articles, each devoted to an important and current topic in Banach space research.

This <b>multi-volume</b> major <b>publication</b> is the most up-to-date and comprehensive collection of these documents. Presented chronologically in their original languages with English translations and with commentaries incorporating the results of recent research, the documents provide an essential and accessible resource for anyone interested in Handel and his music.

In charting his activities in Germany, Italy and Britain, the documents also offer a valuable insight into broader eighteenth-century topics, such as court life, theatrical history, public concerts and competition between music publishers. This volume includes family documents from Halle, then covers Handel's early career in Germany and Italy, followed by the period in which he became an established composer for London's Italian opera company while also writing the Water Music and the Utrecht Te Deum for the British court...|$|R

40|$|International audienceJoseph Needham (1900 - 1995) is {{well-known}} for many essay-articles {{as well as}} for being the author, or rather the editor, of Science and Civilisation in China, a <b>multi-volume</b> encyclopaedia whose <b>publication</b> began in 1954 and which deals with virtually every aspect of the history of science and technology in China. However, this is not the sum of Needham’s career and broader activities. To evoke a few other dimensions of this multi-faceted man, Christian-Socialist Needham began his scientific life as a biochemist, specializing in embryology. He experienced and denounced the rise of fascism and National Socialism in Europe, later contributing to the war effort as the Director of the Sino-British Cooperation Office in Chongqing between 1942 and 1946. This position was his first significant engagement for a worldwide scientific cooperation, a task he carried on while being, from 1946 to 1948, the first head of UNESCO’s Natural Sciences Section. The article interprets against this background Needham’s suspicion towards the comparative method in the history of science. It seeks to identify the origins of Needham’s standpoint on this topic, suggesting that the historian Lucien Febvre and his project of a history of mankind in the context of immediate post-war UNESCO might have had a deep influence on Needham in this respect. Finally, the chapter outlines a suggestion for carrying out comparative method in ways that could avoid the traps Needham identified...|$|R
40|$|This {{introductory}} essay explores some of {{the critical}} contexts for {{an exploration of the}} historiography of Irish art.

This is particularly important, given the conditions of the development of the discipline from the mid-nineteenth century. Finally, further areas for exploration and investigation in the critical historiography of Irish art are suggested, including the impact and future role of digital technologies...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{outlines}} and describes the proposals and dynamics {{of research on}} the art of the eastern territories of the former Commonwealth conducted after 1989 - namely Red Ruthenia and Podolia, the lands lost by Poland in 1945 to the USSR (and now within the limits of Ukraine). Two academic centres dominated in this field: the Institute of Art History of the Jagiellonian University in Cracow and Warsaw’s Institute of Art of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University. Extensive inventory work undertaken from 1992, three years after Poland regained independence, resulted in the monumental publication Materiały do dziejów sztuki sakralnej na dawnych ziemiach wschodnich (Materials for the History of Religious Art in the former Eastern Territories), edited by Jan Ostrowski, including a monographic study of Roman Catholic churches and monasteries in the former Ruthenian, Novogródek and Vilnius Voivodeships. The magnitude of this <b>multi-volume</b> <b>publication</b> can only be compared to the monumental Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego (Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland), published a century earlier. The present article also includes projects undertaken by other academic centres (primarily inventory work of sepulchral art, as well as numerous other publications, mainly conference proceedings). The role of material research in the field of “first art history” has proven to be very inspiring. Eastern studies have led to many spectacular discoveries and introduced new scholarly material, significantly contributing to the knowledge of Polish art history - mainly in modern art, but also applicable to the artistic heritage of the 19 th century and the inter-war period, particularly architecture. An important consequence of the “eastern” inventory work is the training of a new set of art historians (a whole generation even), specialized in the field of inventory and archival research...|$|E

The publication was approved by Cabinet in 1969. R G Neale, Professor of History at Queensland University, was appointed Editor of Historical Documents in 1970. The first Editorial Advisory Board was established in 1971. The aim of this series is to make primary source material in Australian foreign policy available to a wider public. During the period 1939 - 1949, foreign policy is very closely linked to Australian defence policy and the document volumes draw on the records of the Department of Defence as well as the records of the Department of External Affairs. The research and editing process has ensured that the volumes contain a balanced selection of documents illustrating stages in the development of Australian foreign policy. The records consist of folders of copies, some with accompanying notes, made since 1971 of original records considered for inclusion. As each volume contains only a few hundred documents, very few of the thousands of documents copied were published. The contents and subjects covered are broad, including significant WWII documents such as war cabinet agendum and minutes from 1939 - 44; and major world events such as Hitler's peace offensive; the fall of France May 1940; appeals to Roosevelt; war crimes; refugees; Imperial Defence; League of Nations; post war planning and Pacific rim events concerning Japan, New Guinea, Timor and US Pacific interests.
