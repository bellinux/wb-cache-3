During {{the closing of the}} coal mining era, most of the businesses left the square and moved to the <b>main</b> <b>drag</b> of Rt. 45, constructed in 1926. The courthouse built by John W. Gaddis was replaced with a modern, more efficient building in 1967 after the older building was condemned. Over the years, the architecture that graced Harrisburg square has slowly turned to rotting older structures mixed in with a hodge-podge of newer updated buildings. Currently there are a few privately owned downtown renovation projects in progress on and around the square.|$|E

The war created a great demand for energy, which was satisfied by expanded strip mining operations throughout the Harrisburg Coal Fields. Shortly after World War II, {{it became clear}} that coal was losing favor to other energy sources such as oil and natural gas. In contrast to other cities in the United States that prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes of Saline County began to quickly diminish. Harry Truman stopped briefly in Harrisburg during his whistlestop tour in September 30, 1948, giving some hope for economic recovery for the region. Without hesitating, the long parade of police, buses, and accompanying cars sped through town. Poplar street, at that time the <b>main</b> <b>drag</b> through town, was crowded with multitudes of persons for its entire length. It was reported by the Daily Register Newspaper that cars were lined along Route 13 all the way from Marion and on to Eldorado on Route 45. In 1950 Assistant State Attorney General of Illinois, George N. Leighton, Represented parents in a proceeding which desegregated the public schools of Harrisburg.

25|$|After 1910 steady {{population}} decline {{was driven}} {{by the lack of}} significant population in outlying areas, migration to larger urban centers, and the absence of dynamic economic factors to generate wealth. The hardware store closed in 1928 and the bank, like thousands of other undercapitalized small-town banks in the United States, went out of business in 1929 or 1930 {{in the aftermath of the}} stock market crash of 1929. U.S. Census bureau data indicates that the population fell to 102 in 1920, 80 in 1930, rose slightly to 89 in 1940, and fell to 62 in 1950, 35 in 1960 and 24 in 1970. As local establishments burned down or went out of business they were not replaced, and finally the post office was discontinued in 1980 when the census bureau pegged Tenney's population at 19. Today the only remaining business in town is the elevator. The only commercial building remaining on the <b>main</b> <b>drag</b> is the former James Bigsby general store, later the G.A. Klugman general store, which also housed the post office until its closing in 1980. The building was vacant for several years, but was recently purchased and is being rehabilitated.|$|E
2500|$|Fly-reel drag {{systems have}} two {{purposes}} 1.)

There are four <b>main</b> <b>drag</b> systems that are used with the fly reel {{and these are the}} ratchet-and-pawl, caliper drags, disc drags, and center-line drags. [...] The ratchet-and-pawl drag clicks automatically while the spool is spinning. [...] The caliper drag causes the calipers to brush up against the reel spool. [...] A disc drag is when pressure is applied on the plates which then applies pressure on the spool. Center-line drags also known as the best kind of drag because the pressure is directly on the spool close to the axis of rotation.|$|E

Simmer In Your Hotseat was released in 2004 on Boston-based indie label Endless Recordings. The first album received a positive reception, and earned the band an opening gig for the Arcade Fire shortly after its release.

2500|$|In 1971, Phoenix {{cemented}} {{the precedent}} of previous ad-hoc zoning decisions with {{the adoption of}} the Central Phoenix Plan, which envisioned unlimited building heights along Central Avenue. The new plan, however, did not sustain long-term development of the Central Corridor. Only a few office towers were constructed along North Central during this decade and none approached the scope of projects constructed during the previous decade. Instead, downtown resurged in popularity during the 1970s, witnessing a flurry of construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s. [...] In 1979, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages—each with its own village core where greater height and density is permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture. [...] Phoenix officially turned from its roots as a city built around its two <b>main</b> <b>drags</b> to a city of many nodes later connected by freeways. The cluster of high-rises north of Thomas Road became part of the Encanto village core.|$|R

In his extremity the poor boy uttered a wild cry for help, but he shouted in vain, for there was no one else at work in the level. But Zackey was not the boy to give way to despair, or to act thoughtlessly, or in wild haste in this emergency. He suddenly recollected that there was a rope somewhere about the level. He sought for and found it. Fastening an end of it round the body of the man, under the armpits, he so arranged that the knot of the loop should reach a few inches beyond his head, and on this part of the loop he spread a coat, which thus formed a support to the head, and prevented it being dragged along the ground. While engaged in this operation the poor boy was well-nigh suffocated with smoke, and had to run back once to where the air was purer in order to catch a breath or two. Then, returning, he seized the rope, passed it over his shoulder, and bending forward with all his might and <b>main</b> <b>dragged</b> the man slowly but steadily along the floor of the level to a place where the air was comparatively pure.|$|R
