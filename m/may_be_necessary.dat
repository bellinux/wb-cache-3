5|$|Hereditary {{recurrent}} pneumothorax or pulmonary cysts {{are associated}} with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary.</b>|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{data sets}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> for certain phasing methods. For example, MAD phasing {{requires}} that the scattering be recorded at least three (and usually four, for redundancy) wavelengths of the incoming X-ray radiation. A single crystal may degrade too much during the collection of one data set, owing to radiation damage; in such cases, data sets on multiple crystals must be taken.|$|E
5|$|Surgical {{exploration}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> {{to obtain}} a suitable biopsy and to accurately stage a patient with cholangiocarcinoma. Laparoscopy {{can be used for}} staging purposes and may avoid the need for a more invasive surgical procedure, such as laparotomy, in some patients. Surgery is also the only curative option for cholangiocarcinoma, although it is limited to patients with early-stage disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, {{job training and}} social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. In {{those who do not}} improve with other antipsychotics clozapine may be tried. In more serious situations where there is risk to self or others involuntary hospitalization <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary,</b> although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.|$|E

5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, repeaters <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E

5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} folding patterns that have flat-folded states, {{it does not}} describe the folding process needed to reach that state. For some folding patterns, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping {{the rest of the}} paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For rigid origami (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} in 1998, Kiedis and Flea {{decided it was time}} to fire their guitarist. Navarro was furious when confronted by Kiedis and Flea, but {{eventually}} accepted his termination. The Chili Peppers were fighting, and on the verge of breaking up. Flea was beginning to question the band's future and thought it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to break the band up. He made one last attempt to keep the band together, asking Frusciante to rejoin. Frusciante had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program after more than five years of heroin addiction, and gladly accepted the invitation.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary,</b> usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E

5|$|For {{aerodynamic}} aircraft which operate {{relative to}} the air, winds affect groundspeed, {{and in the case}} of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind may play a significant or solitary role in their movement and ground track. The velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off with a tailwind <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> under certain circumstances, a headwind is generally desirable. A tailwind increases takeoff distance required and decreases the climb gradient.|$|E
5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{is performed}} {{to measure the}} opening pressure, {{as well as to}} obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to exclude alternative diagnoses. If the opening pressure is increased, CSF may be removed for transient relief (see below). The CSF is examined for abnormal cells, infections, antibody levels, the glucose level, and protein levels. By definition, all of these are within their normal limits in IIH. Occasionally, the CSF pressure measurement may be normal despite very suggestive symptoms. This may be attributable to the fact that CSF pressure may fluctuate {{over the course of the}} normal day. If the suspicion of problems remains high, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to perform more long-term monitoring of the ICP by a pressure catheter.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{shift workers}} have {{difficulty}} maintaining a healthy sleep-wake schedule due to night or irregular work hours. Shift {{workers need to}} be strategic about napping and drinking caffeine, as these practices <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> for work productivity and safety, but should be timed carefully. Because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake, additional sleeping environment changes should include reducing disturbances by turning off phones and posting signs on bedroom doors to inform others when they are sleeping.|$|E

5|$|TBI is {{frequently}} difficult to diagnose and treat. Early diagnosis {{is important to}} prevent complications, which include stenosis (narrowing) of the airway, respiratory tract infection, and damage to the lung tissue. Diagnosis involves procedures such as bronchoscopy, radiography, and x-ray computed tomography to visualize the tracheobronchial tree. Signs and symptoms vary based on the location and severity of the injury; they commonly include dyspnea (difficulty breathing), dysphonia (a condition where the voice can be hoarse, weak, or excessively breathy), coughing, and abnormal breath sounds. In the emergency setting, tracheal intubation {{can be used to}} ensure that the airway remains open. In severe cases, surgery <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to repair a TBI.|$|E
5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E
5|$|A {{new game}} {{mechanic}} {{to the series}} {{is the use of}} a slate found on all the Ages. These slates can be carved using the mouse to create shapes and symbols. The use of the slate is necessary to communicate with a shadowy race of creatures known as the Bahro. The Bahro understand certain symbols drawn on the slate and will respond to them; the creatures also retrieve the slate and return it to its original space if the player drops it. Slate symbols can cause environmental changes such as rain or increased wind, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> for solving puzzles. The slate cannot be carried everywhere due to its size. For example, the player will have to leave the slate behind if they want to climb a ladder.|$|E
