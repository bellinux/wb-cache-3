The EF5 tornado that struck Hackleburg and Phil Campbell eventually damaged <b>main</b> <b>power</b> lines coming from Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant further to the northeast.

5|$|In April 2010, {{after months}} of {{political}} pressure, the government passed the 18th Amendment, which reduced the President to a ceremonial figurehead by stripping {{the office of the}} power to dissolve Parliament, to dismiss the Prime Minister, and to appoint military chiefs. The amendment also lifted the restriction of two terms as Prime Minister, which enabled Zardari's foremost political rival, Nawaz Sharif, to seek a third term. The amendment was passed with virtually unanimous support in Parliament and Zardari himself espoused the legislation because of political pressure. After the 18th Amendment, Zardari's <b>main</b> <b>power</b> derived from his position as leader of the PPP, which controls the largest bloc in Parliament.|$|E

Richard left England in May 1194, and Longchamp accompanied him to the continent, never to return to England; Longchamp returned to the Emperor's court in 1195. Richard continued to use Longchamp in diplomacy—although it was Geoffrey who arranged a truce with King Philip in 1194—as well as retaining the bishop as chancellor, but the <b>main</b> <b>power</b> in England was now Hubert Walter.

It would appear this plan was never developed fully. Though the later H-22 was given the E-1, the F-2 remained the H-20s <b>main</b> <b>power</b> plant.

5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter {{out of the}} war. Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the <b>main</b> <b>power</b> of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.|$|E
5|$|The {{agreement}} between Henry and Rhys was to last until Henry's death in 1189. When Henry's sons rebelled {{against him in}} 1173 Rhys sent his son Hywel Sais to Normandy to aid the king, then in 1174 personally led an army to Tutbury in Staffordshire to assist at the siege of the stronghold of the rebel Earl William de Ferrers. When Rhys returned to Wales {{after the fall of}} Tutbury, he left a thousand men with the king for service in Normandy. King Henry held a council at Gloucester in 1175 which was attended by a large gathering of Welsh princes, led by Rhys. It appears to have concluded with the swearing of a mutual assistance pact for the preservation of peace and order in Wales. In 1177 Rhys, Dafydd ab Owain, who had emerged as the <b>main</b> <b>power</b> in Gwynedd, and Cadwallon ap Madog from Rhwng Gwy a Hafren swore fealty and liege homage to Henry at a council held at Oxford. At this council the king gave Meirionnydd, part of the kingdom of Gwynedd, to Rhys. There was some fighting in Meirionnydd the following year, but Rhys apparently made no serious attempt to annex it.|$|E

5|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up {{a new era in}} Chola–Chalukya relations. SaktivarmanI, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja CholaI. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the <b>main</b> <b>power</b> in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Helen passed through, cleanup efforts began as power crews had to remove downed trees before fixing power lines. The <b>main</b> <b>power</b> {{lines in the}} city were {{restored}} within 24hours and rural areas were stated to have their power back {{within a day or}} two. Two days after the storm, 500 homes remained without electricity and frustrated residents were further angered after discovering that the Power and Water agency was in control of tree removal and not emergency services. With the power company in charge of clearing downed trees, they stated that their crews would only be dealing with cases involved power lines. Residents with trees in their yards or even on their homes were told to contact private contractors to remove them. By 9January, more than 100 homes were still without power in northern Darwin, resulting in angry outcries from those still left in the dark. Cleanup efforts dragged on for more than two months as debris was still present in Darwin in March. Removal of tree stumps took through at least mid-April as the cost to remove downed trees exceeded A$1million (US$882,000). Due to the damage wrought by Helen, its name was retired following its usage. However, it was not replaced by any particular name as a new naming scheme was implemented the following season.|$|E
