40|$|A {{model that}} {{allows one to}} predict the {{tracking}} performance of the Block 4 receiver {{in the presence of}} a continuous wave radio frequency interference is discussed. Experimental and analytical results are provided for a typical Deep Space Network operational mode. Simulation and experimental results show good agreement with theoretical prediction for the static phase error and out-of-lock values. Predicted phase jitter is consistently lower than the experimental and simulated results by a factor of one-half for small interference to signal ratio (ISR) when the offset frequency is small. For large ISR, good agreement is observed. The analytical model assumes a noiseless condition, which is valid only when the loop is operated at strong signal levels. Experimental data indicate, however, that even at the <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> signal <b>level</b> of 10 -dB carrier margin, reasonably good prediction can still be obtained.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{discussed}} the accumulation Vogršček. The main purpose {{was to assess the}} energy potential of the accumulation Vogršček taking into account the actual use of water for irrigation. In the first part we described the dam. In the second part we reviewed the hydrological data and other project documentation available about the accumulation. Then we calculated the water balance of the accumulation. We took into account all losses, biological minimum and need for irrigation. In the third part we calculated the energy production for the variant, in which we took into account the hypotheses that in the first year accumulation only fills up and that the water level in the reservoir should at all times be above the <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> water <b>level.</b> The last hypothesis says that the accumulation is full at normal <b>operating</b> water <b>level.</b> In the fourth part we calculated energy production for the second variant - optimized system, which considered the same first two hypotheses as did the third part. In this part we also took into account that the water level of the accumulation at end of March every year has to be at least at normal <b>operating</b> water <b>level</b> and that the reservoir is full at maximum water level. In both variants, we performed the calculation for several different scenarios, so that we gradually increased the installed power flow and tried to figure out when the production of energy is at its maximum. In the last part, we designed all the technical parameters of the powerhouse, sketched a design and calculated the cost of the investment that would be required to build such power plant. The objective was to determine whether the investment {{in the construction of the}} power plant was justified and provide a comparison with the original study of energy use done by the IBE...|$|R
30|$|The dam’s {{operation}} {{depends on}} the level of head water which must be between a <b>minimum</b> and maximum <b>operating</b> <b>level</b> of 240 and 278  feet (ft) respectively. Some of the turbines are shutdown during periods with water levels below 240  ft and this usually result in load shedding of electricity (i.e. a planned electrical power shutdown in parts of the country to prevent the collapse of the entire power system). In addition, the inlet surface of the dam stands at 226  ft: this is the “critical” level above which water can run through the penstocks to generate electrical power. Thus, the generation of electricity from the dam will come to a complete halt for water levels below 226  ft. On the other hand, during spells of high water levels close to 278  ft, the excess water is spilled to avoid overflow or dam failure. The spillage usually causes flooding in communities downstream with its attending destruction to lives and properties.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{renewable}} energy (RE) sources, primarily wind and solar generation, is poised to grow significantly within the Indian power system. The Government of India has established a target of 175 gigawatts (GW) of installed RE capacity by 2022, including 60 GW of wind and 100 GW of solar, up from 29 GW wind and 9 GW solar {{at the beginning of}} 2017. Using advanced weather and power system modeling made for this project, the study team is able to explore operational impacts of meeting India’s RE targets and identify actions that may be favorable for integration. Our primary tool is a detailed production cost model, which simulates optimal scheduling and dispatch of available generation in a future year (2022) by minimizing total production costs subject to physical, operational, and market constraints. Our team comprises a core group from the Power System Operation Corporation, Ltd. (POSOCO), which is the national grid operator (with representation from the National, Southern, and Western Regional Load Dispatch Centers) under Ministry of Power, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), and a broader modeling team that includes Central Electricity Authority (CEA), POWERGRID (the central transmission utility, CTU), and State Load Dispatch Centers in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Andhra Pradesh. Our model includes high-resolution wind and solar data (forecasts and actuals), unique properties for each generator, CEA/CTU’s anticipated buildout of the power system, and enforced state-to-state transmission flows. Assuming the fulfillment of current efforts to provide better access to the physical flexibility of the power system, we find that power system balancing with 100 GW of solar and 60 GW of wind is achievable at 15 -minute operational timescales with minimal RE curtailment. This RE capacity meets 22 % of total projected 2022 electricity consumption in India with annual RE curtailment of 1. 4 %, in line with experiences in other countries with significant RE penetrations (Bird et al. 2016). Changes to operational practice can further reduce the cost of operating the power system and reduce RE curtailment. Coordinating scheduling and dispatch over a broader area is the largest driver to reduce costs, saving INR 6300 crore (USD 980 million) annually when optimized regionally. Lowering <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>levels</b> of coal plants (from 70 % to 40 %) is the biggest driver to reduce RE curtailment—from 3. 5 % down to 0. 76 %. In fact, this operating property is more influential than faster thermal generation ramp rates in lowering the projected levels of curtailment. While this study does not answer every question relevant to planning for India’s 2022 RE targets, it is an important step toward analyzing operational challenges and cost saving opportunities using state-of-the-art power system planning tools. Further analysis can build upon this basis to explore optimal renewable resource and intrastate transmission siting, system stability during contingencies, and the influence of total power system investment costs on customer tariffs...|$|R

The results were the following. The maximum operating speed on the last 200 m of the tangent (V 85 max_ 200) is higher than the operating speed at the midpoint of the tangent. The operating speed in the midpoint of the curve overestimates the <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> speed on curve (V 85 min,c). A relationship between the point along the curve where the <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> speed is achieved and the geometric features of the tangent-curve transition was defined.
