2500|$|The Leclerc has an eight-cylinder SACM (now Wärtsilä) V8X-1500 1,500hp Hyperbar {{diesel engine}} and a Renk AG [...] {{automatic}} transmission, with five forward and two reverse gears. The official maximum speed by road is 72km/h and 55km/h cross country (speeds {{in excess of}} 80km/h were reported on road). The maximum range is given as 550km, and can be extended to 650km with removable external tanks. The [...] "hyperbar" [...] system integrates a Turbomeca TM 307B gas turbine in the engine, acting both as a turbocharger and an APU giving auxiliary power to all systems when the main engine is shut down. The Hyperbar name comes from the unusually high boost pressure of 7.5 bar and the resulting <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressure</b> of 32.1 bar. To compare, the largest diesel engine in the world (the Wärtsila RTA96) has a <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressure</b> of 18.6 bar.

2500|$|A {{peripheral}} {{intake port}} gives the highest <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressure,</b> however, side intake porting produces a more steady idle, {{because it helps}} to prevent blow-back of burned gases into the intake ducts which cause [...] "misfirings", caused by alternating cycles where the mixture ignites and fails to ignite. Peripheral porting (PP) gives the best <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressure</b> throughout the rpm range, but PP was linked also to worse idle stability and part-load performance. Early work by Toyota led to {{the addition of a}} fresh air supply to the exhaust port, and proved also that a Reed-valve in the intake port or ducts improved the low rpm and partial load performance of Wankel engines, by preventing blow-back of exhaust gas into the intake port and ducts, and reducing the misfire-inducing high EGR, at the cost of a small loss of power at top rpm. David W. Garside, the developer of the Norton rotary engine, who proposed that earlier opening of the intake port before top dead center (TDC), and longer intake ducts, improved low rpm torque and elasticity of Wankel engines. That is also described in Kenichi Yamamoto's books. Elasticity is also improved with a greater rotor eccentricity, analogous to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine. Wankel engines operate better with a low-pressure exhaust system. Higher exhaust back pressure reduces <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressure,</b> more severely in peripheral intake port engines. The Mazda RX-8 Renesis engine improved performance by doubling the exhaust port area compared with earlier designs, and there has been specific study of the effect of intake and exhaust piping configuration on the performance of Wankel engines.|$|E

In passenger cars, the KERS may reduce the amount of thermal energy needed to reaccelerate the car following a deceleration recovering part of the braking energy. This translates in a first, significant fuel energy saving. Also considering the KERS torque boost increasing the total torque available to accelerate the car, large engines working at very low brake <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressures</b> and efficiencies over driving cycles may also be replaced by small higher power density engines working at much higher brake <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressures</b> and therefore much higher part load efficiencies.

2500|$|In {{the event}} of a combat or {{emergency}} situation, the mixture control may be moved to the auto rich position, providing extra fuel to the engine, or in military aircraft, into military position, if the aircraft is so equipped. [...] When in the military position, the Anti-Detonation Injection (ADI) system is activated, injecting the ADI fluid into the engine intake system. [...] The pressure in the ADI system moves the derichment diaphragm in the fuel control to close off the derichment jet, reducing the fuel flow to a leaner mixture which produces higher engine power by raising the <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressure.</b> This causes the cylinder head temperature to increase to a very high level, which dramatically increases the risk of detonation (see: engine knocking). Adding the ADI fluid raises the mean octane level of the charge preventing pre-ignition and also lowers the cylinder temperatures to a more acceptable level. As this operation takes the engine well beyond its normal design limits, this power setting is not suitable for prolonged use. Once the ADI fluid is exhausted or if the mixture control valve is moved out of the military position, the fuel control derichment diaphragm pressure is lost, and the derichment jet is opened once again for normal fuel flow.|$|E
2500|$|Mazda's RX-8 {{car with}} the Renesis engine met California State fuel economy requirements, {{including}} California's low emissions vehicle (LEV) standards. This was achieved {{by a number of}} innovations. The exhaust ports, which in earlier Mazda rotaries were located in the rotor housings, were moved to the sides of the combustion chamber. This solved the problem of the earlier ash buildup in the engine, and thermal distortion problems of side intake and exhaust ports. A scraper seal was added in the rotor sides, and some ceramic parts were used in the engine. This approach allowed Mazda to eliminate overlap between intake and exhaust port openings, while simultaneously increasing the exhaust port area. The side port trapped the unburned fuel in the chamber, decreased the oil consumption, and improved the combustion stability in the low-speed and light load range. The HC emissions from the side exhaust port Wankel engine are 35–50% less than those from the peripheral exhaust port Wankel engine, because of near zero intake and exhaust port opening overlap. Peripheral ported rotary engines have a better <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressure,</b> especially at high rpm and with a rectangular shaped intake port. [...] However, the RX-8 was not improved to meet Euro 5 emission regulations and was discontinued in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The power a Formula One engine {{produces}} {{is generated}} by operating {{at a very high}} rotational speed, up to 15,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). This contrasts with road car engines of a similar size which typically operate at less than 6,000 rpm. The basic configuration of a naturally aspirated Formula One engine had not been greatly modified since the 1967 Cosworth DFV and the <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressure</b> had stayed at around 14 bar MEP. Until the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal valve springs used to close the valves. The speed required to operate the engine valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power loss to drive the camshaft and the valves {{to the point where the}} loss nearly offset the power gain through the increase in rpm. [...] They were replaced by pneumatic valve springs introduced by Renault, which inherently have a rising rate (progressive rate) that allowed them to have extremely high spring rate at larger valve strokes without much increasing the driving power requirements at smaller strokes, thus lowering the overall power loss. [...] Since the 1990s, all Formula One engine manufacturers used pneumatic valve springs with the pressurised air allowing engines to reach speeds of over 20,000rpm.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} weakly and strongly stratified turbulent convection on the <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> Lorentz force, and especially on the <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> magnetic <b>pressure.</b> Earlier studies with isotropically forced non-stratified and stratified turbulence {{have shown that the}} contribution of the turbulence to the mean magnetic pressure is negative for mean horizontal magnetic fields that are smaller than the equipartition strength, so that the <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> magnetic <b>pressure</b> that takes into account the turbulence effects can be negative. Compared with earlier cases of forced turbulence with an isothermal equation of state, we find that the turbulence effect is similar to or even stronger in the present case of turbulent convection. This is argued to be due to the anisotropy of turbulence in the vertical direction. Another important difference compared with earlier studies is the presence of an evolution equation for the specific entropy. Mean-field modelling with entropy evolution indicates that the negative <b>effective</b> magnetic <b>pressure</b> can still lead to a large-scale instability which forms local flux concentrations, even though the specific entropy evolution tends to have a stabilizing effect when applied to a stably stratified (e. g. isothermal) layer.

These three fuels were tested under an engine speed of 1500 rpm with various brake <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressures</b> (BMEPs). The results indicated that PCO can be used well in the diesel engine without engine modification, and that BD 20 {{can be used as}} a good alternative fuel to reduce the exhaust pollution. In addition, at low engine loads (0. 13 MPa and 0. 26 MPa), the combustion pressure of PCO is the smallest, compared with BD 20 and ULSD, because the lower calorific value of PCO is lower than that of ULSD. However, at high engine loads (0. 39 MPa and 0. 52 MPa), the rate of heat release (ROHR) of BD 20 is the highest because the canola oil biodiesel is an oxygenated fuel that promotes combustion, shortening the ignition delay period.

With this increasing number of degrees of freedom (DoFs) for engines and the consequent considerable calibration effort required to optimize engine performance, traditional manual engine calibration or optimization methods are reaching their limits. An automated and efficient engine optimization approach is desired. In this paper, interdisciplinary research on a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) -based global optimization approach is developed for a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine. The performance of the HCCI engine optimizer is demonstrated by the cosimulation between an HCCI engine Simulink model and a Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA 2) -based multiobjective optimizer Java code. The HCCI engine model is developed by Simulink and validated with different engine speeds (1500 - 2250 r/min) and indicated <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressures</b> (IMEPs) (3 - 4. 5 bar).

The model was validated with measured steady state air and fuel flow rates and indicated and brake <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressures.</b> The model provides satisfactory accuracy and demonstrates the ability of the approach to produce fairly accurate steady state maps of BMEP and BSFC.

Satisfactory measurement of small IMEP and derivation of FMEP at low loads is also a major issue. Measurements of fuel consumption were then collected during warm up for different configurations of the cooling system, with a standard mechanical water pump (MWP) and an electrical water pump (EWP), at a constant BMEP and engine speed.

Modeling friction during warm-up, when temperatures of head metal, block metal, coolant and oil are well below hot steady values and decoupled to some extent (split or no flow coolant tests) proves to be challenging.

The model of a 6 -cylinder turbocharged engine (Holset HDX 55 V) was calibrated using an experimental BSFC map to predict engine exhaust thermodynamic conditions such as exhaust mass flow rate and exhaust temperature under various operating conditions. These engine exhaust conditions were then utilized to feed the inlet conditions for both the ORC and turbocompounding models, evaluating the available exhaust energy to be recovered by each technology. Firstly the ORC system model was simulated to obtain the power that can be generated from the system. Having this additional power converted to useful work, the BSFC was observed to reduce around 2 – 5 % depending upon engine’s speed and BMEP. The initial model of the engine was then modified by considering a second turbine representing turbocompounding heat recovery system. The BSFC was increased due to the back-pressure from the second turbine, but the energy generated from the turbine was sufficient to reduce the BSFC further. However, by application of turbocompounding no improvement in BSFC was achieved at low engine’s speeds.
