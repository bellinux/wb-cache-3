25|$|However, neither {{group of}} {{countries}} was pro-gender {{equality in the}} sense that policies aimed at equal rights between the sexes are popular. In Arab countries, 82% of survey respondents believe that a man has <b>more</b> <b>right</b> to a job than a woman while 63% of respondents from the non-Arab countries felt the same way. These researchers attributed these attitudes to the strong religious identity and adherence of respondents thus implicating Islam in promoting gender inequality in majority Muslim nations.|$|E
25|$|The unwholesome states (akusala) are {{described}} in the Buddhist texts, as those relating to thoughts, emotions, intentions, and these include pancanivarana (five hindrances) - sensual thoughts, doubts about the path, restlessness, drowsiness, and ill will of any kind. Of these, the Buddhist traditions consider sensual thoughts and ill will needing <b>more</b> <b>right</b> effort. Sensual desire that must be eliminated by effort includes anything related to sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touch. Ill will that must be eliminated by effort includes any form of aversion including hatred, anger, resentment towards anything or anyone.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, newly {{discovered}} documents {{revealed that the}} total illegal catch was even larger. The accounting based on that information showed that the Soviet whaling fleets caught 529 right whales from 1962 to 1968 in the eastern North Pacific, plus 152 <b>more</b> <b>right</b> whales in the Sea of Okhotsk in 1967 and 1968, {{for a total of}} 661 right whales. Catches were distributed in the Bering Sea (115), eastern Aleutian Islands (28), Gulf of Alaska (366), Sea of Okhotsk (132), and other areas (20). Detailed information on catches of 112 right whales taken in May/June 1963 shows a broad distribution in offshore waters of the Gulf of Alaska, consistent with 19th century historical whaling records. Other major areas in which right whales were caught include south of Kodiak Island, western Bristol Bay (southeastern Bering Sea), and the central Sea of Okhotsk off eastern Sakhalin Island. The catches primarily involved large mature animals, thus greatly inhibiting recovery of right whales in these regions.|$|E

In the second round, the electors voted at 61.56% or 9,434 votes for Nicolas Sarkozy against 38.44% or 5,890 votes for Ségolène Royal, a result <b>more</b> <b>right</b> in relation to the national average that was, in the second round, 53.06% for Nicolas Sarkozy and 46.94% for Ségolène Royal. For this presidential election, the turnout rate was very high. There were 19,774 registered voters on electoral lists in Aix, 81.18% or 16,053 voters participated in the rounds, and the abstention rate was 18.82% or 3,721 votes, with 4.54% or 729 votes having a spoilt or unmarked ballot, and finally 95,46% or 15,324 votes were cast.|$|E
25|$|With the {{emergence}} of a compromise government between the <b>more</b> <b>right</b> wing Liberals and the more moderate conservatives, as manifested in the constitutional monarchy, the lack of development and further notable reforms in the country led the more left wing Liberal party, made up mostly of middle class partisans, to reformulate its policy objectives. Thus was born a Republican Party that advocated radical liberal reforms such as universal suffrage, the end of the privileges of the Catholic Church and rents given to the nobles, and above all, the overthrow of a political elite discredited by its corruption and incompetence. The country went into debt and was increasingly dependent on the northern provinces of the country. The humiliation of submitting to the ultimatum of 11 January 1890 issued by Great Britain, an allied nation, was undoubtedly a cathartic episode. Britain demanded that Portugal surrender what are now Zambia and Zimbabwe and abandon its plans to acquire lands in this part of Africa that it needed to connect Angola and Mozambique.|$|E
25|$|Layton did {{not seek}} {{election}} to the House of Commons by running in a by-election, as is the tradition among new party leaders without a seat. Instead, he waited until the 2004 federal election to contest the riding of Toronto—Danforth against Liberal Dennis Mills. With no seat in the House of Commons, he appointed the runner-up, longtime Winnipeg-area MP Bill Blaikie, as parliamentary leader. Although he had no parliamentary seat, Layton was noted for drawing considerable attention from the Canadian mass media. Much of his rhetoric involved attacking the policies of then Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin as conservative, and arguing {{the ideology of the}} Liberal Party of Canada had shifted in a <b>more</b> <b>right</b> wing direction. Another focus of Layton's leadership was to focus the party's efforts on Quebec, one of the party's weaker provinces. One of his opponents in the leadership race, Pierre Ducasse, was the first Québécois to run for leader of the NDP. After the race, Layton appointed Ducasse as his Quebec lieutenant and party spokesperson.|$|E

500|$|Although arguably {{barred from}} doing so, Parliament began debating a regency. In the House of Commons, Charles James Fox {{declared}} his {{opinion that the}} Prince of Wales was automatically entitled to exercise sovereignty during the King's incapacity.

He even stated that, without parliamentary authority [...] "the Prince of Wales had no <b>more</b> <b>right...</b> to assume the government, than any other individual subject of the country." [...] Though disagreeing on the principle underlying a regency, Pitt agreed with Fox that the Prince of Wales would be the most convenient choice for a regent.|$|E

[...] That Crédit Mobilier was a corrupt organization had been a secret badly kept, even mentioned on the floor of Congress, and editor Sam Bowles wrote at the time that Garfield, in his positions on committees dealing with finance, [...] "...had no <b>more</b> <b>right</b> to be ignorant in a matter of such grave importance as this, than the sentinel has to snore on his post." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Kunis {{replaced}} Lacey Chabert in {{the role}} of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy, created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. MacFarlane added: [...] "What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost <b>more</b> <b>right</b> for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, {{but there was something about}} Mila– something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work." [...] Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007. She also voiced Meg in the Family Guy Video Game!. Kunis described her character as [...] "the scapegoat." ...|$|E
500|$|The last {{of these}} pamphlets, Taxation No Tyranny (1775), was a defence of the Coercive Acts and a {{response}} to the Declaration of Rights of the First Continental Congress of America, which protested against taxation without representation. Johnson argued that in emigrating to America, colonists had [...] "voluntarily resigned the power of voting", but they still had [...] "virtual representation" [...] in Parliament. In a parody of the Declaration of Rights, Johnson suggested that the Americans had no <b>more</b> <b>right</b> to govern themselves than the Cornish people, and asked [...] "How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?" [...] If the Americans wanted to participate in Parliament, said Johnson, they could move to England and purchase an estate. Johnson denounced English supporters of American separatists as [...] "traitors to this country", and hoped that the matter would be settled without bloodshed, but he felt confident that it would end with [...] "English superiority and American obedience". Years before, Johnson had stated that the English and the French were just [...] "two robbers" [...] who were stealing land from the natives, and that neither deserved to live there. After the signing of the 1783 Peace of Paris treaty, marking the colonists' defeat of the British, Johnson was [...] "deeply disturbed" [...] with the [...] "state of this kingdom".|$|E
500|$|The series {{garnered}} more {{controversy in}} 2005 {{with the release}} of the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, when a Real Canadian Superstore grocery store accidentally sold several copies before the authorised release date. The Canadian publisher, Raincoast Books, obtained an injunction from the Supreme Court of British Columbia prohibiting the purchasers from reading the books in their possession. A comment by a media lawyer that [...] "there is no human right to read" [...] led to a debate in the public sphere about whether free access to information was a human right. Michael Geist, the Canada Research Chair of Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in response, [...] "The copyright law claim was particularly puzzling. While copyright law does provide copyright owners with a basket of exclusive rights, the right to prohibit reading is not among them. In fact, copyright law has very little to say about what people can do with a book once they have purchased it." [...] Free-speech activist Richard Stallman posted a statement on his blog calling for a boycott until the publisher issued an apology. Solicitors Fraser Milner and Casgrain, who represented Raincoast and formulated the legal argument for the embargo, have rebutted this, saying that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies only to the government, not to private litigation, and does not offer any protection of the right to read in any case, and the innocent purchasers of the Harry Potter book had no <b>more</b> <b>right</b> to read it than if they had come into possession of someone's secret diary.|$|E
