25|$|However, after a {{successful}} rehabilitation, the next opportunity for Hadlee {{to claim the}} test wicket world record was against India in India in 1988. After touring India in 1976 Hadlee, plagued by stomach troubles, had decided never to play cricket there again, however the opportunity to <b>make</b> <b>history</b> was too strong a lure to pass up.

25|$|The 2007 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race saw Wild Oats XI {{equal the}} 59-year-old record of Morna, by winning a hat-trick of line honours titles.

25|$|In 1889, South Africa {{became the}} third test-playing nation when it played against England at Port Elizabeth. Soon after, a 2nd test was played at Cape Town. However, these two matches, {{as was the}} case with all early matches {{involving}} the erstwhile 'South African XI' against all touring teams, did not receive the status of official 'Test' matches until South Africa formed the Imperial Cricket Conference with England and Australia in 1906. Neither did the touring English team organized by Major Warton even claim to be representing the English cricket team; the matches were marketed as 'Major Warton's XI' v/s 'South African XI' instead. Even the players who participated did not know that they had played international cricket, and the side that played South Africa was regarded to be of weak county strength. The team was captained by C.A. Smith, a decent medium pacer from Sussex, and for two of the Major Warton's XI, Basil Grieve and The Honourable Charles Coventry, the two Tests constituted their entire first-class career. Even so, the nascent, fledgling 'South African XI' was very weak, losing both tests comfortably to England, English spinner Johnny Briggs claiming 15-28 in the second Test at Cape Town. However, Albert Rose-Innes did <b>make</b> <b>history</b> by becoming the first South African bowler to take a five-wicket haul in Tests at Port Elizabeth.|$|E
