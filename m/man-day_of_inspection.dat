50|$|Though no one {{returned}} {{after the end}} of the SL-4 mission in February 1974, the crew left a bag filled with supplies to welcome visitors, and left the hatch unlocked. NASA discouraged any discussion of additional visits due to the station's age, but in 1977 and 1978, when the agency still believed the Space Shuttle would be ready by 1979, it completed two studies on reusing the station. By September 1978, the agency believed Skylab was safe for crews, with all major systems intact and operational. It still had 180 <b>man-days</b> <b>of</b> water and 420 <b>man-days</b> <b>of</b> oxygen, and astronauts could refill both; the station could hold up to about 600 to 700 <b>man-days</b> <b>of</b> drinkable water and 420 <b>man-days</b> <b>of</b> food. Before SL-4 left they did one more boost, running the Skylab thrusters for 3 minutes which added 11 km in height to its orbit. Skylab was left in a 433 by 455 km orbit on departure. At this time, the NASA-accepted estimate for its re-entry was nine years.|$|R

The ancient Mediterranean practice was to build the outer hull first, and the ribs afterwards. To secure and strengthen the hull, cables (hypozōmata) were employed, fitted in the keel and stretched by means of windlasses.

However, much of the construction was supervised by his subordinates. Captain H. Young surveyed the route, completing this task by June 1817. Bridges were indeed needed, and an additional $5,000 was appropriated in March 1818. Major Perrin Willis took command of the construction gang, then numbering about fifty, in April 1819, when the road reached the Pearl River.

Monthly distances walked per year vary significantly across years (H =  44.04, p <  0.001) and aside from the distances covered in 2006 and 2007 that did not differ, all the distances differed significantly.

50|$|Although Germany {{had about}} double the {{population}} of Britain (80 million versus 40 million), it had to use far more labor to provide food and energy. Britain imported food and employed only a million people (5% of the labour force) on farms, while Germany used 11 million (27%). For Germany to build its twelve synthetic oil plants with a capacity of 3.3 million tons a year required 2.4 million tons of structural steel and 7.5 million <b>man-days</b> <b>of</b> labor. (Britain imported all its oil from Iraq, Persia and North America). To overcome this problem, Germany employed millions of forced laborers and POWs; by 1944, they had brought in more than five million civilian workers and nearly two million prisoners of war—a total of 7.13 million foreign workers.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{treatment}} of the inspection-system design problem when inspection is unreliable and subject to classification errors. Our approach, based on the theory of Error-Correcting Codes (ECC), leads to the development <b>of</b> a Self-Correcting <b>Inspection</b> (SCI) decision rule that does not require complete knowledge <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> error probabilities. We show that the proposed rule assures correct classification, if the number <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> errors {{is less than a}} certain number. We analyze the performance of the SCI decision rule under different inspection situations, including some situations that are uncommon in the field of error-correcting codes. Then, we show how the underlying mathematical structure can be applied to determine the number <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> and the level <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> reliability in order to minimize the sum of inspection-related costs. The practical contribution of this work lies in that it expands the ability of the designer <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> systems to deal with cases where there is very little or no information regarding the reliability <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> operations. 1.

50|$|Estimates of the {{manpower}} {{needed to build}} Stonehenge put the total effort involved at millions of hours of work. Stonehenge 1 probably needed around 11,000 man-hours (or 460 <b>man-days)</b> <b>of</b> work, Stonehenge 2 around 360,000 (15,000 man-days or 41 years). The various parts of Stonehenge 3 may have involved up to 1.75 million hours (73,000 days or 200 years) of work. The working of the stones is estimated to have required around 20 million hours (830,000 days or 2,300 years) of work using the primitive tools available at the time. Certainly, the will to produce such a site must have been strong, and an advanced social organization would have been necessary to build and maintain it. However, Wally Wallingtons work suggests that Stonehenges construction may have required fewer man-hours than previously estimated.|$|R

40|$|Inspection {{has been}} an {{increasingly}} important feature of central monitoring {{of education in the}} 1990 s. This article examines the technical reliability <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> processes in initial teacher training, drawing extensively on methodology and procedures adopted by the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) between 1996 and 1998. A definition of reliability is advanced and tested against the procedures <b>of</b> <b>inspection,</b> especially by examining the security of internal and external judgements at the pass/fail borderline and the moderation and training procedures deployed by OFSTED. The methodology <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> is found to be insufficiently reliable for the consequences which flow from it. Tensions are explored between the technicist model <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> underlying OFSTED initial teacher training procedures and the 'informed conoisseurship' model hitherto deployed by members of Her Majesty's Inspectorate. In consequence, there are unresolved tensions between the expressed aspiration for 'improvement through inspection' and the use <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> to police compliance...|$|R
