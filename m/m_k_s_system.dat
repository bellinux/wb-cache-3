40|$|The {{principal}} {{changes that}} I {{have made in}} preparing this revised edition of the book are the following. (i) Carefuily selected worked and unworked examples {{have been added to}} six of the chapters. These examples have been taken from class and degree examination papers set in this University and I am grateful to the University Court for permission to use them. (ii) Some additional matter on the geometrieaI application of veetors has been incorporated in Chapter 1. (iii) Chapters 4 and 5 have been combined into one chapter, some material has been rearranged and some further material added. (iv) The chapter on int~gral theorems, now Chapter 5, has been expanded to include an altemative proof of Gauss's theorem, a treatmeot of Green's theorem and a more extended discussioo of the classification of vector fields. (v) The only major change made in what are now Chapters 6 and 7 is the deletioo of the discussion of the DOW obsolete pot funetioo. (vi) A small part of Chapter 8 on Maxwell's equations has been rewritten to give a fuller account of the use of scalar and veetor potentials in eleetromagnetic theory, and the units emploYed have been changed to the <b>m.</b> <b>k.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|As {{the steel}} is tested {{for all types}} of tests viz, compressive, tensile test, shear test, torsion test, etc. This paper {{provides}} an experimental investigation for the compressive strength of Cold – Formed light gauge steel plain (stiffened) tubular sections. The test specimens were brake pressed from high strength structural steel sheets. In addition, the test strengths were compared with the design strengths calculated using the Indian Standard and North American Specification for Cold –Formed steel structures. Compression members are linear members in which axial forces act to cause elongation (stretch). Such members can sustain loads up to the ultimate load, at which stage they may fail by rupture at a critical section. However, if the gross area of the member yields over a major portion of its length before the rupture load is reached, the member may become non – functional due to excessive elongation. I. S. 801 - 1975 is in Working Stress Method (W. S. M.) and in (<b>M.</b> <b>K.</b> <b>S.)</b> <b>system.</b> So it is required to study Allowable Stress Design (A. S. D.), Load and Resistance-Factor-Design (L. R. F. D.) and Limit State Method (L. S. M.). It is revealed that the design strengths predicted by the Specification and Standard are generally very conservative. It is observed that some specimen show lower strength than the value predicted by the American Iron and Steel Institute...|$|E
40|$|THE {{importance}} of the velocity {{of light in the}} development of electrical theory and practice is sometimes overlooked and in this review special emphasis will therefore be given to this aspect of the work and to the determinations of the velocity by electrical methods. It will moreover be assumed at the outset that in accordance with theory the value is independent of the frequency of the waves. The electrical, radio, and optical methods are all measurements of the same constant and the different titles of the various papers are merely indications of the particular technique employed. If there are discrepancies in the results then the theory must be re-examined; but so far no significant discrepancies have been found. The suggestion that light consists of an electromagnetic radia [...] tion was first made rather tentatively by Faraday in 1846, and ten years later Weber and Kohlrausch obtained a, value by an electrical method which was in good agreement with Fizeau's optical value. Faraday's suggestion, and this experimental support, were much in Maxwell's mind when he wrote his famous paper on the electromagnetio field. It may be regarded as an experimental faot which stimulated the formulation of electromagnetio theory rather than as a deduction made from it, as is often supposed. The early electrical methods are described as the determination of the ratio of the electromagnetic to the electrostatic unit, and to see how this arose it is necessary to consider the historical development ofelectrical units. Coulomb's law of the force between two charges ql and q. at a, distance d in a medium of relative per-mittivity 8 is to-day written in the <b>M.</b> <b>K.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>system</b> of units as: F = gIg.

The distance graph G(Z, Dm, <b>k,</b> <b>s)</b> has as vertex set all integersZ and edges connecting i and j whenever | i−j | ∈Dm, <b>k,</b> <b>s.</b> This paper investigates chromatic {{numbers and}} circular chromatic {{numbers of the}} distance graphs G(Z, Dm, k,s).
