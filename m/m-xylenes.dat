40|$|In {{this paper}} there is {{presented}} {{the results of}} acoustic research of velocity and absorption in three pure liquids: thiophene, p-, and <b>m-xylenes</b> and the mixtures of these liquids and CCl 4 with xylenes. The measurements for the mixtures of thiophene were provided by Eggers method at the frequencies between 0. 3 and 5 MHz and pure liquids by pulse method in the frequency range between 10 MHz and 10 GHz, all at the temperature of 293. 15 K, but for tiophene at 281 & 333 K. The result of absorption in both thiophene and CCl 4 shows that in the observed relaxation processes, caused by Kneser processes, take part all vibrational degrees of freedom. The process {{can be described as}} a vibrationa relaxation with one relaxation time. In the mixtures absorption decreased with increasing the quantity of xylenes, as is predicted by theory for gases and these results suggest that the absorption is probably due to the same phenomenon as in gases...|$|E
40|$|Fuel-oil {{contamination}} of groundwater and waterways is common throughout the world. The fuel components methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and o-, p- and <b>m-xylenes</b> (BTEX) compounds {{are most likely}} to reach a borehole after a contamination event, and also those that pose the greatest risk. Various gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) methods are available for the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) but many of these are not suitable for rapid and combined analysis of MTBE and BTEX. Here we describe and validate a simple and reliable method that fulfils these requirements. The method is quick: 48 samples can be analysed in a 24 hour period using the Precept II 1 autosampler and therefore is suitable for high throughput work. Validation of our experiments is presented in the form of linearity, precision and intra-day repeatability of standards as well as limits of detection and limits of quantification for the range 1 ÿ 20 mg/l. This MTBE/BTEX analytical method developed was used to study the optimization of a modular post-abstraction remediation system incorporating air-stripping and granular activated carbon (GAC) technologies (Hall, 2004), from which a selection of sample data is presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of {{experiments}} to investigate interactions between industrial solvents and common medications the interaction between <b>m-xylene</b> and aspirin was studied. As both these substances are metabolised and excreted as glycine conjugates there would possibly be competition for this conjugation pathway. Five male volunteers were exposed on separate occasions to <b>m-xylene</b> by inhalation (100 ppm), aspirin (1500 mg) by mouth, and <b>m-xylene</b> and aspirin together under controlled conditions in an exposure chamber. Urine and blood samples were collected and analysed for <b>m-xylene,</b> aspirin, and their metabolites. The amounts of the major glycine conjugates produced from <b>m-xylene</b> (m-methylhippuric acid) and aspirin (salicyluric acid) were significantly reduced by about 50 % when <b>m-xylene</b> and aspirin were coadministered. There {{appears to be a}} mutual inhibition on the formation of the respective glycine conjugates. It is suggested that the inhibition is due to competition for either the enzymes, acyl-CoA synthetase, or glycine N-acylase. These findings have implications in the biological monitoring of workers exposed to <b>m-xylene...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} differences in excretion of toluene and <b>m-xylene.</b> After intraperitoneal injection of toluene or <b>m-xylene</b> (5 mmole per kg body weight) to Wistar female rats, urine and expired air were collected regularly. The concentrations of toluene and <b>m-xylene</b> in expired air were determined spectrophotometrically. Their urinary metabolites hippuric acid and m-methylhippuric acid were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The results were: 1. The excretion rates in expired air for 10 hours after the administration of toluene and <b>m-xylene</b> were 37. 7 % and 13. 1 % respectively. After the injection of toluene, the excretion rate per hour of the vapor in expired air increased rapidly, and reached a maximum (6. 1 %) in 2 hours, then decreased in a half-life of 4. 87 hours. The maximum excretion rate of <b>m-xylene</b> per hour was 1. 6 % in 3 or 4 hours; thereafter, the excretion rate decreased more slowly than in the case of toluene. 2. The total excretion rate in urine for 48 hours after administration was 29. 0 % for toluene and 43. 5 % for <b>m-xylene.</b> Urinary excretion of <b>m-xylene</b> is apparently higher than that of toluene, in contrast to expiratory excretion. Following the administration of toluene, about 14 % had been eliminated as hippuric acid in the 0 - 10 and 10 - 24 hours' urine. The concentration of hippuric acid had returned to normal in the 24 - 48 hours' urine. m-Methylhippuric acid in the 0 - 10 hours' urine was 13. 7 % of m-xylene; in the 10 - 24 hours' urine it was 22. 3 %; moreover, 7. 5 % was found even in the 24 - 48 hours' urine. From these results, it is estimated that the velocity of urinary excretion of <b>m-xylene</b> is less than that of toluene. 3. The total excretion rate of toluene in urine and expired air was 51. 9 % and that of <b>m-xylene</b> was 26. 9 %, for 10 hours after the administration. Furthermore, the excretion rate of both 10 hours' expired air and 48 hours' urine, was 66. 7 % for toluene and 56. 6 % for <b>m-xylene.</b> 4. The ratio of 48 hours' urinary excretion to 10 hours' expiratory excretion was 0. 77 for toluene and 3. 58 for <b>m-xylene.</b> These results indicate that toluene was excreted more in expired air than in urine whereas <b>m-xylene</b> was mainly excreted in urine...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} previous subacute treatment with ethanol could modify the kinetics of <b>m-xylene</b> in humans. A group of six volunteers was exposed twice to either 100 or 400 ppm of <b>m-xylene</b> during two hours (between 0800 and 1000). Ethanol was given orally {{in the early evening}} on each of two consecutive days before exposures (total ethanol intake of 137 g). Such ethanol pretreatment affected the kinetics of <b>m-xylene</b> but only at the high exposure (400 ppm). The modifications were: (1) decreased concentration of <b>m-xylene</b> in blood and alveolar air during and after exposure; (2) increased urinary excretion of m-methylhippuric acid at the end of exposure. Ethanol treatment also enhanced the elimination of antipyrine in saliva. Overall, this study showed that the effect of enzyme induction on the metabolism of <b>m-xylene,</b> after ethanol ingestion, depends on the exposure concentration and is not likely to occur as long as the exposure concentrations remain under the current maximum allowable concentration (100 ppm) in the workplace...|$|R
40|$|Catalytic {{transformation}} of three methyl benzenes (toluene, <b>m-xylene,</b> and 1, 2, 4 - trimethylbenzene) {{has been investigated}} over USY-based FCC zeolite catalyst in a novel Riser Simulator at different operating conditions. The effect of reaction conditions on the variation of isomerization to disproportionation products ratio (I/D), distribution of trimethylbenzene (TMB) isomers (1, 3, 5 -to- 1, 2, 3 -) and values of pxylene/ o-xylene (P/O) ratios are reported. The sequence of reactivity of the three alkyl benzenes was found to decrease {{as the number of}} methyl group per benzene ring decreases, as follows: 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene > <b>m-xylene</b> > toluene. This is true at all temperatures investigated over the USY zeolite. Toluene was found unreactive in our reaction condition. Effectiveness factor (eta(ss)) of both 1, 2, 4 -TMB and <b>m-xylene</b> have been estimated. While <b>m-xylene's</b> eta(ss) was close to unity at all condition, 1, 2, 4 -TMB's eta(ss) was less than that of <b>m-xylene.</b> The effectiveness factor was estimated from the quasi-steady state approximation modeling of the experimental data involving a decay function based on 'Time on Stream' (TOS).

40|$|The {{ability of}} NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites to adsorb <b>m-xylene</b> and toluene was studied experimentally. Thus, the {{adsorption}} isotherms of two volatile organic compounds, toluene and <b>m-xylene,</b> on NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX were measured at 298, 308, 318, and 333 K using a vacuum microbalance system. The toluene and the <b>m-xylene</b> were chosen because {{they belong to}} the same chemical family. The experimental data obtained were correlated with different existing adsorption isotherm models such as the Langmuir model, the Freundlich model, the Fowler-Guggenheim model, the Hill-De Boer model and the Sips model. The Langmuir model is well adapted to the description of <b>m-xylene</b> and toluene adsorption on NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites at all four temperature. The Sips model is also found to be well adapted to describe the adsorption of toluene on to NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites at all four temperature. The Freundlich model, the Fowler-Guggenheim model, and the Hill-De Boer model were not satisfactory. The adsorption affinity of <b>m-xylene</b> on NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites is sufficiently greater than the affinity of toluene. The adsorption affinity of <b>m-xylene</b> and toluene decreased in the following order NaY>NaX>BaX>KY>BaY. These results demonstrate the high capacity of NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites to remove vapors of <b>m-xylene</b> and toluene at very low concentrations. However, in the volumetric method, the accuracy of the data depends on the precision with which the equilibrium pressure is measured. Besides, the existence of dead volume, the value of which is never known with high precision, is a source of error. That is why, the gravimetric method remains the most accurate method for measuring gas-solid equilibrium data for pure gases...|$|R

Substrates that supported growth were toluene, p-methylbenzyl alcohol, p-tolualdehyde, p-toluic acid, and the analogous m-methyl derivatives, including <b>m-xylene.</b> Cell extracts prepared from Pseudomonas Pxy after growth with either p-xylene or <b>m-xylene</b> oxidized the p- and m-isomers of tolualdehyde {{as well as}} p-methylbenzyl alcohol. The same cell extracts also catalyzed a “meta” fission of both 3 - and 4 -methylcatechol.

All of the enrichment cultures demonstrated complete depletion of toluene and partial depletion of o-xylene within 3 months of incubation. The depletion of o-xylene was correlated to and dependent on the metabolism of toluene. No losses of benzene, p-xylene, or <b>m-xylene</b> were observed in these initial enrichment cultures. However, <b>m-xylene</b> was degraded by a subculture that was incubated on <b>m-xylene</b> alone. Complete carbon, nitrogen, and electron balances were determined for the degradation of toluene and <b>m-xylene.</b> These balances showed that these compounds were mineralized with greater than 50 % conversion to CO 2 and significant assimilation into biomass.

Characterization of strains with mutations in structural genes of this pathway demonstrates that the inducers of the enzymes responsible for further degradation of m-toluate include <b>m-xylene,</b> m-methylbenzyl alcohol, and m-toluate, whereas the inducers of the enzymes responsible for oxidation of <b>m-xylene</b> to m-toluate include <b>m-xylene</b> and m-methylbenzyl alcohol but not m-toluate.

40|$|International audienceBackground The genetic {{network of}} the TOL plasmid pWW 0 {{of the soil}} {{bacterium}} Pseudomonas putida mt- 2 for catabolism of <b>m-xylene</b> is an archetypal model for environmental biodegradation of aromatic pollutants. Although nearly every metabolic and transcriptional component of this regulatory system is known to an extraordinary molecular detail, the complexity of its architecture is still perplexing. To gain an insight into the inner layout of this network a logic model of the TOL system was implemented, simulated and experimentally validated. This analysis made sense of the specific regulatory topology out {{on the basis of}} an unprecedented network motif around which the entire genetic circuit for <b>m-xylene</b> catabolism gravitates. Results The most salient feature of the whole TOL regulatory network is the control exerted by two distinct but still intertwined regulators (XylR and XylS) on expression of two separated catabolic operons (upper and lower) for catabolism of <b>m-xylene.</b> Following model reduction, a minimal modular circuit composed by five basic variables appeared to suffice for fully describing the operation of the entire system. In silico simulation of the effect of various perturbations were compared with experimental data in which specific portions of the network were activated with selected inducers: <b>m-xylene,</b> o-xylene, 3 -methylbenzylalcohol and 3 -methylbenzoate. The results accredited the ability of the model to faithfully describe network dynamics. This analysis revealed that the entire regulatory structure of the TOL system enables the action an unprecedented metabolic amplifier motif (MAM). This motif synchronizes expression of the upper and lower portions of a very long metabolic system when cells face the head pathway substrate, <b>m-xylene.</b> Conclusion Logic modeling of the TOL circuit accounted for the intricate regulatory topology of this otherwise simple metabolic device. The found MAM appears to ensure a simultaneous expression of the upper and lower segments of the <b>m-xylene</b> catabolic route that would be difficult to bring about with a standard substrate-responsive single promoter. Furthermore, it is plausible that the MAM helps to avoid biochemical conflicts between competing plasmid-encoded and chromosomally-encoded pathways in this bacterium...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} gamma rays on the {{electrical}} properties of <b>m-xylene</b> {{have been studied}} {{as a function of}} temperature. The variation of the direct current (d. c) electrical conductivity (ionic conductivity), pH and bulk electrical potential of the sample with gamma radiation have been examined in the temperature range of 5 oc to 50 oc. Also the variation of ionic conductivity, pH and bulk electrical potential with temperature was measured for non-irradiated sample and also for irradiated sample at different doses of 30. 20, 80. 60, 110. 90 and 141. 10 mGy respectively. The activation or bonding energy H of each sample was computed at different irradiation dose levels to indicate resistance to radiolysis. The result showed a marked difference between the values of ionic conductivity, pH and bulk electrical potential of irradiated and non irradiated samples studied. There is a decrease in both electrical conductivity and bulk electrical potential with temperature, the pH value increases with temperature. This study is useful in understanding how reactive <b>M-xylene</b> is to radiation and how gamma radiation affect the electrical properties of <b>M-xylene.</b> The result obtained in this study provides reference data on the effect of gamma rays on <b>M-xylene,</b> and this can stimulate further research work in this area...|$|R
40|$|ArticleIn this paper, {{a report}} on {{modelling}} and sensitivity studies of a laboratory-scale extractor type catalytic membrane reactor having a nanocomposite MFI-alumina membrane tube as separation unit is presented. Meta-xylene isomerization over Pt-HZSM- 5 catalyst was conducted in the reactor and the results compared with model output. Sensitivity of the model to changes in certain design parameters (membrane thickness, membrane porosity, membrane tortuosity and reactor size) was evaluated for in-depth understanding of the fundamental behaviour of the system during <b>m-Xylene</b> isomerization. The model output deviated from the experimental results with percentage errors of 17 %, 29 %, 0. 05 % and 19. 5 % for p-Xylene yield in combined mode, p-Xylene selectivity in combined mode, p-Xylene selectivity in permeate-only mode and <b>m-Xylene</b> conversion, respectively. Despite {{the discrepancy between the}} experimental results and the model output due to the to quality of data employed in the simulation and assumptions adopted for model simplification, the model could explain the behaviour of e-ZCMR during <b>m-Xylene</b> isomerization over Pt-HZSM- 5 catalyst and also adaptable to e-ZCMRs of different configurations such as hollow fibre MFI-alumina membrane-based e-ZCMRs. However, acquisition of accurate kinetics and diffusion data through experimentation is essential to improve on the model. As expected, the sensitivity analysis revealed that membrane porosity, membrane tortuosity, membrane effective thickness and reactor size play a significant role on the performance of the e-ZCMR during the isomerization. Although, this model is of a preliminary nature, still it provides useful assistance in understanding the fundamental behaviour of e-ZCMR during <b>m-Xylene</b> isomerization and offers a platform upon which further modelling studies on <b>m-Xylene</b> isomerization in e-ZCMR can be built. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract A {{strictly}} anaerobic bacterium, strain OX 39, {{was isolated}} with o-xylene as organic substrate and sulfate as electron acceptor from an aquifer at a former gasworks plant contaminated with aromatic hydrocarbons. Apart from o-xylene, strain OX 39 grew on <b>m-xylene</b> and tolu-ene {{and all three}} substrates were oxidized completely to CO 2. Induction experiments indicated that o-xylene, <b>m-xylene,</b> and toluene degradation were initiated by dif-ferent specific enzymes. Methylbenzylsuccinate was iden-tified in supernatants of cultures grown on o-xylene and <b>m-xylene,</b> and benzylsuccinate was detected in superna-tants of toluene-grown cells, thus indicating that degrada-tion was initiated in all three cases by fumarate addition to the methyl group. Strain OX 39 was sensitive towards sul-fide and depended on Fe(II) in the medium as a scavenger of the produced sulfide. Analysis of the PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA gene revealed that strain OX 39 affiliates with the gram-positive endospore-forming sulfate reducers of the genus Desulfotomaculum and is the first hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacterium in this genus...|$|R
40|$|Control of coating solvent vapors by {{adsorption}} on {{activated carbon}} in {{the automotive industry}} can {{be affected by the}} presence of humidity. As a foundation to better understand the adsorptive behavior of these organic solvents, in this investigation, adsorption of <b>m-xylene</b> in the presence of water vapor on granular activated carbon was studied. Single component (<b>m-xylene</b> and water vapor) adsorption experiments were first conducted as prerequisites for the binary component (<b>m-xylene</b> with water vapor) studies. The dynamic method of gas adsorption technique (passing a flux composed of carrier gas and adsorbate vapor through a fixed bed adsorbent and subsequently analyzing the outlet adsorbate concentrations) was used throughout this research. The experimental results were then compared with predictive models to capture the dominant features of the data. For the equilibrium and kinetic studies of water vapor adsorption, an online digital hygrometer was used in conjunction with an electronic balance. Relative humidity values from 18 to 96...|$|R
