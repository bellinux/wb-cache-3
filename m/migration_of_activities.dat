End users of the data range from instrument scientists to global change and climate researchers to federal agencies and foreign governments. Many of these users apply data mining techniques to large volumes of data (up to 1 TB) received from the GES DAAC. However, rapid advances in processing power are enabling increases in data processing that are outpacing tape drive performance and network capacity. As a result, the proportion of data that can be distributed to users continues to decrease. As mitigation, we are migrating more data mining and mining preparation activities into the data center {{in order to reduce the}} data volume that needs to be distributed and to offer the users a more useful and manageable product. This <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> faces a number of technical and human-factor challenges. As data reduction and mining algorithms are normally quite specific to the user's research needs, the user's algorithm must be integrated virtually unchanged into the archive environment. Also, the archive itself is busy with everyday data archive and distribution activities and cannot be dedicated to, or even impacted by, the mining activities. Therefore, we schedule KDD 'campaigns' (similar to reprocessing campaigns), during which we schedule a wholesale retrieval of specific data products, offering users the opportunity to extract information from the data being retrieved during the campaign...|$|E

40|$|We analyse the {{seismicity}} pattern including b-value in {{the north}} Sumatra–Great Nicobar region from 1976 to 2004.

40|$|Late Mesozoic-Cenozoic {{igneous rocks}} cover {{a large area}} in southwestern United States and {{northern}} Mexico, which extends over several provinces with contrasting structural and petrotectonic characteristics and lithospheric structure. Chemical and petrographic data show magmatic arc affinities, particularly for the calc-alkaline suites, supporting a genetic link with the plate convergence process between the North American and the Farallon and Kula plates. However, {{the width of the}} magmatic arc (in excess of 1100 km) and the trench-arc gap (estimated from paleogeographic reconstructions) are in marked contrast when compared to the ranges observed in contemporary subduction zone-magmatic arc systems. Geochronological and stratigraphic studies have documented apparent east-west <b>migration</b> patterns <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> which sup¬port that the magmatic province {{is the result of a}} long-term evolution of the convergent continental margin. The wide magmatic province defined by the space-time pattern of geochronological data is referred to as a spatial magmatic arc. Several models with changing geometrical, kinematic and dynamic relationships are discussed: (1) variable subduction dip-constant depth and range of melting (magma generation zone); (2) variable dip-variable depth and range of melting; (3) low-angle subduction and variable trench-arc gap (lateral <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> trench due to variable dip in the shallow zone and sediment accretion); (4) extensional tectonism; and (5) intra-arc and back-arc extension. The space-time pat¬terns show that the spatial magmatic arc was displaced away from the trench up to 450 km between 120 Myr to 55 Myr, and then back towards the trench between 30 Myr to 20 - 15 Myr. The width of the spatial magmatic arc increased up to 550 km from 120 Myr to 70 Myr and then remained fairly constant up to 20 Myr. Igneous rocks at the easternmost end of the magmatic arc occur in the Gulf alkaline province, whose geochemical and petrographic characteristics show a transition from subduction related to intraplate extension, in agreement with a model of low-angle subduction and lateral <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> during the Tertiary...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An {{integrated}} tectono-stratigraphic {{analysis of}} the East Tanka fault zone, Suez rift, indicates fault growth by linkage of initially isolated fault segments {{that is consistent with}} fault growth models based on displacement–length (D-L) scaling laws. During the initial 2. 4 Ma of rifting, the East Tanka fault zone was composed of two en-echelon fault segments c. 1 – 1. 5 km long, separated by a hanging-wall intrabasin high that controlled the geometry of depocentres filled with continental deposits. Alluvial fan conglomerates were fed through the region between the two fault segments, and form a discrete coarse-grained body, preserved in the immediate hanging wall of the fault zone. Subsequent stratigraphic patterns indicate that the two faults hard-linked to form a single fault zone c. 3. 5 km long. Hard linkage of the segments resulted in <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> the zone of maximum displacement and subsidence into the zone of linkage. Uplift due to the <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> caused modification <b>of</b> drainage in the footwall of the fault zone that terminated the growth of the alluvial fan. This study demonstrates the need to integrate structural and stratigraphic data when attempting to reconstruct the temporal and spatial evolution of normal fault zones. Additionally, the fault dynamics illustrated have implications for tectono-stratigraphic models of rift basins, and syn-rift stratigraphic evolution...|$|R
40|$|Relations between spatial {{attention}} and motor intention were investigated {{by means of}} an EEG potential elicited by shifting attention to a location in space {{as well as by the}} selection of a hand for responding. High-density recordings traced this potential to a common frontoparietal network activated by attentional orienting and by response selection. Within this network, parietal and frontal cortex were activated sequentially, followed by an anterior-to-posterior <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> culminating in the lateral occipital cortex. Based on temporal and polarity information provided by EEG, we hypothesize that the frontoparietal activation, evoked by directional information, updates a task-defined preparatory state by deselecting or inhibiting the behavioral option competing with the cued response side or the cued direction of attention. These results from human EEG demonstrate a direct EEG manifestation of the frontoparietal attention network previously identified in functional imaging. EEG reveals the time course of activation within this network and elucidates the generation and function of associated directing-attention EEG potentials.

The factor is present in medium conditioned by mast cells as well as lysates of mast cells. The stimulatory effect of mast cells on migration is specific for capillary endothelial cells. Furthermore, mast cells have no mitogenic activity for capillary endothelial cells.
