2500|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{determine}} the porosity of aerogel: the three main methods are gas adsorption, <b>mercury</b> <b>porosimetry,</b> and scattering method. In gas adsorption, nitrogen at its boiling point is adsorbed into the aerogel sample. The gas being adsorbed is dependent {{on the size of the}} pores within the sample and on the partial pressure of the gas relative to its saturation pressure. [...] The volume of the gas adsorbed is measured by using the Brunauer, Emmit and Teller formula (BET), which gives the specific surface area of the sample. [...] At high partial pressure in the adsorption/desorption the Kelvin equation gives the pore size distribution of the sample. [...] In <b>mercury</b> <b>porosimetry,</b> the mercury is forced into the aerogel porous system to determine the pores' size, but this method is highly inefficient since the solid frame of aerogel will collapse from the high compressive force. [...] The scattering method involves the angle-dependent deflection of radiation within the aerogel sample. [...] The sample can be solid particles or pores. [...] The radiation goes into the material and determines the fractal geometry of the aerogel pore network. [...] The best radiation wavelengths to use are X-rays and neutrons. [...] Aerogel is also an open porous network: the difference between an open porous network and a closed porous network is that in the open network, gases can enter and leave the substance without any limitation, while a closed porous network traps the gases within the material forcing them to stay within the pores. The high porosity and surface area of silica aerogels allow them to be used in a variety of environmental filtration applications.|$|E

Therefore, in this paper Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) samples were impregnated with a hot melting amid wax. The apparent densities were measured with helium pycnometry and <b>mercury</b> intrusion <b>porosimetry.</b> The pore size distribution was determined by using <b>mercury</b> intrusion <b>porosimetry</b> and samples were visualized with 3 D X-ray tomography. The remaining air void spaces were calculated with all three methods. The apparent densities ranged from 1. 18 g cm-³ till 1. 19 g cm-³ for treated pine and 1. 21 g cm-³ till 1. 23 g cm-³ for treated beech. As {{a result of the}} wax impregnation, the pore volume decreases from 65 - 68 % to 12 - 13 % for pine and from 53 - 58 % to 7 - 9 % for beech. The pore size distribution shifts to smaller pores. The ratio of the micropores measured by <b>mercury</b> intrusion <b>porosimetry</b> is overestimated. On the one hand blocked large pores are compressed by the movement of wax deposits under high pressure during the <b>mercury</b> intrusion <b>porosimetry</b> (“movement-effect”).

Non-invasive 3 D X-ray imaging detects such macropores but the size of the detected pores is limited by the obtained resolution.

The porosities and pore size distributions of consolidated pigments were measured using <b>mercury</b> <b>porosimetry.</b> Prior to this work, <b>mercury</b> <b>porosimetry</b> was rarely used in this field due to problems associated with the conventional interpretation of <b>mercury</b> <b>porosimetry</b> data. These problems were examined and two limitations of <b>mercury</b> <b>porosimetry</b> were addressed. Firstly, the shrinkage of compressible samples causes an apparent increase in void volume and secondly, large void spaces shielded by smaller ones are not intruded until anomalously high applied pressures of mercury are reached. The first limitation was overcome by means of a new correction procedure which, uniquely, also allows the measurement of the bulk modulus of the continuous solid phase of a porous sample. Shielding effects have been taken into account by means of a software package known as Pore-Cor, which generates a three dimensional structure which has both a mercury intrusion curve and porosity in close agreement with experiment. It has also been possible to calculate the permeabilities and tortuosity of the simulated structure and this provides realistic and useful values, which may not be measured experimentally. <b>Mercury</b> <b>porosimetry</b> and a range of specialised absorption techniques, including liquid porosimetry, were used to characterise the porous structures of a highly filled paper which had been calendered using a range of different conditions.
