40|$|The {{study for}} the {{development}} of a <b>microbender</b> based on conducting polymer actuators and finalized for the handling of cells is here presented. The device is similar to other proposed wet systems but it works in dry conditions. We would like to use the actuators to release under control different substances to stimulate in different ways the cells. We have developed a special deposition device capable of managing small quantities of material. The thickness and height of polymer deposited can be controlled by variation the polymer concentration and the deposition speed. The bending device is constituted of two electroactive polymer (EAP) elements made of conducting polymers (CP) with an interposed film of solid polymer electrolyte, SPE and two electrodes which give the electrochemical stimulation to the EAP. To foresee the response of these actuators, we modified a model proposed for piezoelectric materials and adapted to describe the behavior of CP's and we used also finite element model analysis to simulate its bending...|$|E
40|$|Water sensing systems using {{distributed}} detection techniques {{through which}} {{the presence or absence}} of water may be monitored and located along the length of an optical fibre have numerous potential applications in, for example, district heating systems and the water distribution network. A number of configurations based on silica fibres have been demonstrated in the past but there is understandable user caution since in all these configurations the water needs to be in close contact with the fibre itself. Consequently any minor damage to coatings – and these are typically exposed – allows water seepage to the surface of the silica and consequent vulnerability to catastrophic degradation. In this paper we assess the prospects which a plastic fibre base system may offer as a prospective distributed monitoring system for water and – potentially – for other aqueous parameters such as pH and ionic concentration which could be addressed using different interface detection materials. The principal benefit of plastic optical fibres lies in their ruggedness when exposed to water. The basic principle which we shall exploit is based upon configuring a cable structure in which the parameter to be monitored – here water – causes an interface material to swell. In turn this swelling material forces the optical fibre into contact with a mircobend inducing structure causing detectable optical loss. Varying the swelling material can assist in optimising the response to either particular aqueous solutions and/or to limitations imposed by other parameters such as temperature. Based upon our previous experience with silica fibre we investigated graded index POF as the optical transmission medium and assessed its sensitivity to microbend induced losses, both as a function of the period of the microbend applied and of the amplitude of the peak to peak displacements introduced by the <b>microbender</b> from the mutual axis of the fibre. Full details of these results will be presented in the paper but in summary we found that significantly greater displacements are required for POF and for the silica fibres and consequently the interface swelling material needs to offer significantly greater (by at least an order of magnitude) swelling capability in response to the aqueous trigger than we found with the silica precursor. These observations have significant implications for the design of a sensor system and we have produced a preliminary demonstration which certainly responds to the aqueous trigger but because of the different characteristics of the fibre response the sensor responds much more slowly and in the early configurations also exhibits more hysteresis. However for many applications for which a one off trigger is all that is required the convenience of the POF format and the inherent construction and architecture simplicity offer significant compensating benefits. Again more details will be presented in the final paper...|$|E
