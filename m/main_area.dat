5|$|After {{becoming}} an extratropical cyclone, Chantal maintained scattered convection near its center, though its <b>main</b> <b>area</b> of convection and clouds extended to its north. Midday on August 1, the cyclone struck Newfoundland along the Avalon Peninsula, hitting the Placentia Area with full force. It subsequently intensified to attain winds of near hurricane-force. On August 3 the cyclone underwent a final weakening {{trend in the}} far northern Atlantic Ocean, and on August 5 the extratropical remnants of Chantal merged with another extratropical cyclone {{to the east of}} Iceland.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>area</b> of inhabitation of Bantu ethnic {{minorities}} in Somalia {{has historically been}} in village enclaves in the south, particularly between the Jubba and Shebelle river valleys {{as well as the}} Bakool and Bay regions. Beginning in the 1970s, more Bantus began moving to urban centres such as Mogadishu and Kismayo. The displacement caused by the onset of the civil war in the 1990s further increased the number of rural minorities migrating to urban areas. As a consequence of these movements, Mogadishu's traditional demographic makeup changed significantly over the years.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} on August30, the subtropical ridge caused Leslie to turn west-northwestward. By the early on August31, the storm featured well-define outflow in all directions {{and the center of}} circulation was close to the <b>main</b> <b>area</b> of convection. Intensity estimates around that time indicated sustained wind speeds of 70mph (110km/h). However, intensification halted later on August31 as wind shear increased over the storm, causing convection to become displaced from the center. Early on September1, an eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery; however, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} the feature was displaced from the low-level center. The storm became increasingly disorganized, with the circulation displaced from the main convective area several hours later.|$|E

5|$|Alderson's {{situation}} worsened at the Battle of Festubert in May 1915, {{when the}} Canadian Division {{failed to make}} any headway and suffered nearly 2,500 casualties. Another operation a month later, the Second Battle of Givenchy, cost 366 casualties for no appreciable gain. Again, Alderson was not solely at fault in these actions and he remained popular with British Army Headquarters, Prime Minister Borden and with his men, resulting in promotion to command the entire Canadian Expeditionary Force when a second Division arrived late in 1915. Despite this popularity, Sam Hughes continued to hold a grudge against Alderson and opposed him in political circles, taking offense at Alderson's refusal to accept promotions made by Hughes or Carson of untried Canadian officers and instead promoting veteran British officers in their place. The <b>main</b> <b>area</b> of argument {{between the two men}} however was again over the Ross rifle.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} on September21 Harvey {{accelerated}} slightly and turned southeastward. Although {{the center of}} the storm was poorly defined at the time and located to the northwest of the <b>main</b> <b>area</b> of thunderstorm activity, convection was strong in nature. Later that day the storm curved towards the east while approaching Florida. At around 1700UTC on September21 Harvey made landfall near Everglades City, Florida with sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h). The storm further accelerated across the Florida Peninsula and quickly merged with a developing storm off the coast of South Carolina at 0600UTC on September22. Although the remnants of Harvey became unidentifiable later that day, Environment Canada reported that the system crossed Newfoundland before dissipating on September24.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Jeanne {{steadily}} weakened while crossing eastern Hispaniola, and on September 17 it briefly weakened to {{tropical depression}} status after reaching open waters. Its original circulation dissipated {{as a new}} one reformed closer to the <b>main</b> <b>area</b> of thunderstorms. Turning northward, Jeanne slowly reorganized and again reached hurricane status on September 20. It executed a clockwise loop to the west, weakening due to upwelling upon reaching its path again. Jeanne encountered favorable conditions as it continued westward, and it reached major hurricane status before crossing the northern Bahamas on September 25. The next day, it struck Martin County, Florida in nearly the same location as Hurricane Frances just weeks before. Jeanne weakened over land while turning the northwest, deteriorating to tropical depression status over Georgia on September 27. It turned northeastward, becoming extratropical on September 28 before dissipating on September 29 after merging with a cold front.|$|E

5|$|Of the 21,000 civil {{aircraft}} {{registered in the}} UK, 96 per cent are engaged in GA operations, and annually the GA fleet accounts for between 1.25 and 1.35 million hours flown. The single most common class of aircraft is the fixed-wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, but the <b>main</b> <b>area</b> of growth over the last 20 years {{has been in the}} use of more affordable aircraft, such as microlights, amateur built aeroplanes, and smaller helicopters. There are 28,000 Private Pilot Licence holders, and 10,000 certified glider pilots. Some of the 19,000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in GA activities. Although GA operates from more than 1,800 aerodromes and landing sites, ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips, over 80 per cent of GA activity is conducted at 134 of the larger aerodromes. The GA industry, which is around 7 per cent the size of its CAT cousin, employs 12,000 people, and contributes £1.4 billion to the UK economy.|$|E

The divisions of Army Group South were brought up to full strength in late April and early May. The strategic objective was illustrated after the victories of Erich von Manstein and the 11th Army in the Crimea.

5|$|After {{reaching}} peak winds, Tropical Storm Chantal became disorganized {{while the}} center became ill-defined and situated to the west-southwest of the <b>main</b> <b>area</b> of convection; {{this was due}} to unfavorable upper-level winds, although computer models continued to forecast a more favorable upper-level environment. By early on August20, Hurricane Hunters reported several low-level circulations embedded within a large low pressure area. Later that day, wind shear decreased when the storm moved into the Gulf of Honduras. Chantal became much better organized, again reaching peak winds of 70miles per hour (110km/h) before making landfall early on August21 near the border of Mexico and Belize. Initially, the storm was forecast to cross the Yucatán Peninsula and Bay of Campeche and make a second landfall in the state of Veracruz. Chantal slowly weakened over land while moving slowly across northern Belize. Convection decreased markedly late on August21, and early the next day Chantal weakened to tropical depression status. The upper- and middle-level circulations turned to the northeast while the low-level circulation turned to the west-southwest further inland. Weakening continued, and late on August22 Chantal dissipated over the Mexican state of Tabasco.|$|E

5|$|When Henry V died in 1422, Northumberland was {{appointed}} {{member of the}} council appointed to govern during the minority of Henry VI. He might {{have been involved in}} an embassy to the Council of Siena in 1423, but still his <b>main</b> <b>area</b> of responsibility lay in the border region. In the council, he seems to have belonged to the circle around Bishop Henry Beaufort, and he followed Beaufortnow cardinalto peace negotiations at Berwick in 1429. As Warden of the East March, he was constantly occupied with peace negotiations and defence of northern England, but his efforts were constantly frustrated, and in 1434 he resigned his commission. The next year, Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, equally exasperated by the lack of royal support, gave up his commission as Warden of the West March. Northumberland {{was appointed}} joint warden with the earl of Huntingdon of both marches for one year, during which time, although suffering defeat by the Earl of Angus at the Battle of Piperdean, he was able to repel a siege on Roxburgh by James I of Scotland. In 1440 he was once more appointed Warden of the West March, and this time held the position until his death.|$|E
