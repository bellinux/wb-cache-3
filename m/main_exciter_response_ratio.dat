40|$|ABSTRACT Physiological {{stress was}} studied in {{broilers}} {{using a new}} model employing continuous release of adre-nocorticotropin (ACTH). A total of 42 adaptive response parameters were evaluated. A treatment <b>response</b> <b>ratio,</b> P-value transformation, and stress score were determined for each parameter. The treatment <b>response</b> <b>ratio</b> was calculated by dividing the maximum response of the ACTH-treated birds for each parameter by the average response of control (CON) birds in all cases in which maximum response of ACTH-treated birds exceeded the average response of CON. This treatment <b>response</b> <b>ratio</b> is designated hereafter as ACTH/CON ratio. In those cases in which average response of CON exceeded maxi-mum response of ACTH-treated birds, the reciprical equation was employed (i. e., CON/ACTH ratio).

40|$|The {{changes in}} serum trypsin {{concentration}} have been measured in 47 subjects {{for up to}} 2 hours after a Lundh meal. In 18 healthy controls, mean fasting trypsin concentration was 285 +/- 125 ng/ml (mean +/- 2 SD). The maximum increase after the Lundh meal (the trypsin <b>response</b> <b>ratio)</b> was 6. 7 +/- 7. 5 %. Six patients with chronic renal failure had elevated fasting serum trypsin concentrations (range 460 - 1100 ng/ml) but trypsin <b>response</b> <b>ratios</b> fell within the control range. Of five patients with relapsing pancreatitis, two had raised and three normal or low fasting trypsins.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the accuracy of screening postmortem whole blood for oxycodone using the ratio of the oxycodone immunoassay response to the response for the specimen obtained with a general opiate-class immunoassay. Fifty eight specimens which were negative for opiates and 158 postmortem whole blood specimens positive for opiates including 66 specimens known to contain oxycodone were assayed. Specimens were diluted 1 : 5 with assay buffer and analyzed by both the Neogen Oxymorphone/Oxycodone ELISA and the Neogen Opiate Group ELISA (Neogen Corporation, Lexington KY). The oxycodone equivalents in ng/mL from the Oxymorphone/Oxycodone ELISA were divided by the morphine equivalents in ng/mL from the Opiates ELISA to obtain an Oxycodone/Opiates <b>Response</b> <b>Ratio.</b> This ratio was compared with the GC/MS data for all specimens and for opiate positive specimens. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis suggested that optimum relative <b>response</b> <b>ratio</b> was 2. 0. The sensitivity of the ELISA <b>response</b> <b>ratio</b> for the presence of oxycodone at a <b>response</b> <b>ratio</b> cutoff of 2. 0 was 89. 4 % ± 3. 8 % and the specificity was 88. 1 % ± 3. 2 %.

Cross-link interactions are {{necessary in order to}} ensure simultaneous responses in the accommodation and vergence systems. The crosslink interactions are represented most comprehensively by the response AC/A (accommodative vergence) and CA/C (vergence accommodation) ratios, although the stimulus AC/A ratio is measured clinically, and the stimulus CA/C ratio is seldom measured in clinical practice. The present study aims to quantify both stimulus and response AC/A and CA/C ratios in a binocularly normal population, and determine the relationship between them. 25 Subjects (mean±SD age 21. 0 ± 1. 9 years) were recruited from the university population. A significant linear relationship was found between the stimulus and <b>response</b> <b>ratios,</b> for both AC/A (r 2 = 0. 96, p< 0. 001) and CA/C ratios (r 2 = 0. 40, p< 0. 05).

Consumption of medications was acknowledged by placing the thumb on the device. Some patients performed this acknowledgement repeatedly and unconsciously.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty five participants were selected because they had i) excess acknowledgements described above or ii) Impulsive-Compulsive Behaviours or iii) neither of these. A blinded assessor applied clinical scales to measure Impulsive-Compulsive Behaviours, cognition, depression, anxiety and apathy. A <b>Response</b> <b>Ratio,</b> representing the number of acknowledgements/number of doses (expressed as a percentage) was tightly correlated with ratings of Impulsive-Compulsive Behaviours (r² =  0. 79) in 19 / 25 subjects.

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{was performed}} to draw general conclusions concerning the impact of mechanized harvesting operations on the forest soil. Log <b>response</b> <b>ratios,</b> based on soil bulk density, were used to quantify the impact. Although it is generally assumed that clay and silt are more vulnerable than sand textures, the <b>response</b> <b>ratios</b> for clay and sand are similar. Here, the impact is maximal at the 0 - 10 cm depth class (13 to 14 %), and decreases towards the 20 - 30 cm soil layer. For these two textures, the initial bulk density has a strongly significant negative influence on the <b>response</b> <b>ratio</b> as further compaction is prevented by high soil strength. In contrast with general assumptions, bulk densities for silt soils show almost no change, possibly due to relatively high initial bulk densities. For all textures a significant positive relationship exists between the <b>response</b> <b>ratio</b> and the machine weight. Therefore, the deployment of very heavy machines has to be restricted and adjusted to {{the intensity of the}} job. For loam, the number of passages also exerts a significant positive influence on the compaction degree, approaching a constant value at higher traffic intensities. As the results shows that clay and sand are vulnerable for compaction, and that it is generally assumed that silt textures are also prone to soil damage, traffic should be restricted on all textures. Moreover, the high impact from the first passage(s), the compacted initial state of many forest soils and the long recovery period, also count in favour of permanent skid trails...|$|R

The relations between reinforcement ratios obtained from the two schedules and the <b>ratios</b> of <b>responses</b> and time spent on the schedules were described by Baum's (1974) generalized matching equation.

When responding was maintained by both schedules, a period of no responding on either schedule immediately after fixed-interval reinforcement typically was followed by high-rate responding on the variable-ratio schedule. At short fixed-interval values, when a changeover to the fixed-interval schedule was made, responding usually continued until fixed-interval reinforcement was obtained; at longer values, a changeover back to the variable-ratio schedule usually occurred when fixed-interval reinforcement was not forthcoming within a few seconds, and responding then alternated between the two schedules every few seconds until fixed-interval reinforcement finally was obtained...|$|R
