5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States <b>means</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E
25|$|Weaving is the {{technique}} of playing a succession of bells by changing which bell is in each hand as required. This is used by bass and solo or small-ensemble ringers. The large size and weight of bass bells makes four-in-hand ringing impractical and impossible, and often a solo or small-ensemble ringer will need to {{move up and down}} a range of bells, possibly sharing them with others. This technique <b>means</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two bells can be rung in short succession, using the table to damp and free the hand to pick up the next bell. If the ringing sequence requires bells to be rung in tonal order, this technique often results in a weaving pattern as the ringer must often reach across his or her body for the next bell.|$|E
25|$|On rare occasions, blood {{products}} are contaminated with bacteria. This {{can result in}} a life-threatening infection known as transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection. The risk of severe bacterial infection is estimated, as of 2002, at about 1 in 50,000 platelet transfusions, and 1 in 500,000 red blood cell transfusions. Blood product contamination, while rare, is still more common than actual infection. The reason platelets are more often contaminated than other {{blood products}} is that they are stored at room temperature for short periods of time. Contamination is also more common with longer duration of storage, especially if that <b>means</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 5 days. Sources of contaminants include the donor's blood, donor's skin, phlebotomist's skin, and containers. Contaminating organisms vary greatly, and include skin flora, gut flora, and environmental organisms. There are many strategies in place at blood donation centers and laboratories {{to reduce the risk of}} contamination. A definite diagnosis of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection includes the identification of a positive culture in the recipient (without an alternative diagnosis) as well as the identification of the same organism in the donor blood.|$|E

Therefore {{they must have been}} in darkness before Christ's coming; and men did not know as much about life and immortality before Christ's coming as they know--or ought to know--now.|$|R

500|$|Article 9(1) {{states that}} persons may be {{deprived}} of life or personal liberty [...] "in accordance with law". In Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980), {{an appeal to the}} Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from Singapore, it was held that the term law <b>means</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just legislation validly enacted by Parliament, and includes fundamental rules of natural justice. Subsequently, in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal held that such fundamental rules of natural justice embodied in the Constitution are the same in nature and function as common law rules of natural justice in administrative law, except that they operate at different levels of the legal order. A related decision, Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010), apparently rejected the contention that Article 9(1) entitles courts to examine the substantive fairness of legislation, though it asserted a judicial discretion to reject bills of attainder and absurd or arbitrary legislation. In the same case, the Court of Appeal held that law in Article 9(1) does not include rules of customary international law.|$|E
500|$|Jurisdictions such as India, Malaysia and the United States {{interpret}} the same term {{in their respective}} constitutions broadly. In the United States Supreme Court case Munn v. Illinois (1877), Justice Stephen Johnson Field stated that the term life <b>means</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> mere animal existence. Rather, the definition extends to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed. His rationale was that the term should not be [...] "construed in any narrow or restricted sense". Indian courts have likewise adopted a broad interpretation of life in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution to mean more than mere existence – instead, it includes the right to livelihood {{and the right to}} a healthy environment. Subsequently, in Samatha v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1997), the meaning of life was expanded to include the right to live with human dignity; and to the provision of minimum sustenance, shelter, and those other rights and aspects of life that make life meaningful and worth living. Similarly, Justice Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati held in Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India (1984) that the expression life included the right to be free from exploitation, and to the basic essentials of life included in the Directive Principles of State Policy that appear in the Indian Constitution.|$|E

2500|$|Sonnet 28 {{is one of}} 154 sonnets {{written by}} the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare, it was first {{published}} in 1609. The sonnet {{is a part of the}} Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man — usually referred to as [...] "the young man" [...] or the [...] "friend". Shakespeare's use of [...] "friend" [...] <b>means</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just of a sexual nature, it highlights the Renaissance ideal of male fidelity and equality. From sonnets 18 to 126, Shakespeare writes about his relationship with the said young man.

2500|$|Under CRTC rules, American {{networks}} are offered on a [...] "4 + 1" [...] basis, meaning that a cable company may offer any four American commercial networks and PBS on basic cable; other American networks {{can only be}} offered on a pay tier. In most cities, this means that The CW and MyNetwork TV are not available on basic cable because of lower demand for those networks. However, cable providers in border cities {{have been allowed to}} offer all American networks on basic cable that are available over the air in that market, even if that <b>means</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> four commercial {{networks are}} provided.

[...] What the Brotherhood neglected to understand is that democracy <b>means</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> simply holding elections. [...] Real democracy requires inclusiveness, compromise, respect for human and minority rights, and a commitment to the rule of law. [...] Morsi and his inner circle did not embrace any of these principles and instead chose to consolidate power and rule by fiat. [...] As a result the Egyptian people and their economy suffered greatly. It is now up to the Egyptian military to demonstrate that the new transitional government can and will govern in a transparent manner and work to return the country to democratic rule. [...] We are encouraged that a broad cross-section of Egyptians will gather to rewrite the constitution. [...] All parties in Egypt must show restraint, prevent violence, and prepare to be productive players in the future democratic Egypt. [...] We encourage the military to exercise extreme caution moving forward and support sound democratic institutions through which the people and future governments can flourish.|$|E
