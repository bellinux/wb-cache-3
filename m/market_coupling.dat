The primary target of the <b>market</b> <b>coupling</b> is to assure a deeper integration of regional power markets.

Consequently, price levels among the individual market areas converge. By this procedure, not only the security of supply can be increased but the price volatility on relevant power markets can be moderated and the power sale and purchase can become more effective.The Czech, Slovak, Hungarian and Romanian NRAs, TSOs and PXs jointly implemented the extension of CZ-SK-HU <b>Market</b> <b>Coupling</b> to Romanian day-ahead electricity market (4M MC) on 19 November 2014 based on PCR solution.|$|E

An important aspect is the modeling of energy prices, with the aim of forecasting these. The Hourly Price Forward Curve (HPFC) is an important tool in this context, and much work is devoted to this topic. An approach, combining statistical and fundamental models, has been implemented. The original HPFC was usable only for a single price area. His group has been developing it for several areas through the incorporation of <b>market</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanisms. Another application is the valuation of pumped hydro storage plants in the new market conditions. Non-linear learning techniques are used to better capture seasonal variations.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} the European Unions’ {{effort to}} create an integrated pan-European electricity market based on “market coupling” as the proposed allocation mechanism for interconnector transfer capacity. Thus, the thesis’ main focus is if <b>market</b> <b>coupling</b> leads to a price convergence in interlinked markets and how it affects the behavior of electricity price data. The applied research methods are a qualitative, structured literature review and a quantitative analysis of electricity price data. The quantitative analysis relies on descriptive statistics of absolute price differentials and on a Cointegration analysis according to Engle & Granger (1987) ’s two step approach. Main findings are that implicit auction mechanisms such as <b>market</b> <b>coupling</b> are more efficient than explicit auctions. Especially the method of price coupling leads to a price convergence in involved markets, to social welfare gains and reduces market power of producers, as shown on {{the example of the}} TLC <b>market</b> <b>coupling.</b> The <b>market</b> <b>coupling</b> initiative between Germany and Denmark, on the other hand, is evaluated as less successful and illustrates the complexity and difficulties of implementing <b>market</b> <b>coupling</b> initiatives.
