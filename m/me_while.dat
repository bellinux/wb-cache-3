500|$|Many {{fans and}} the press {{interpret}} the song as referring to a psychedelic experience due to lines such as [...] "purple haze all in my brain" [...] and [...] "'scuse <b>me</b> <b>while</b> I kiss the sky". [...] However, Hendrix and those closest to him never discussed any connection between psychedelic drugs and the song, although Shapiro admits that, at the time, {{to do so would}} have been [...] "professional suicide". Chandler, who claimed he was present when Hendrix wrote it, later denied suggestions that Hendrix did so while under the influence of psychedelics. [...] Commenting on the lyrics, Shadwick concludes [...] "the music [...] to tell the larger story. [...] Poised effectively between the twin intoxicants of drugs and desire, they could be interpreted to the listener's taste". [...] In concert, Hendrix sometimes substituted lyrics for comic effect; [...] "'scuse <b>me</b> <b>while</b> I kiss the sky" [...] was rendered [...] "'scuse <b>me</b> <b>while</b> I kiss this guy" [...] (while gesturing towards Mitchell), [...] "'scuse <b>me</b> <b>while</b> I kiss that policeman" [...] (at a near riot in Los Angeles), or [...] "'scuse <b>me</b> <b>while</b> I fuck the sky" [...] (during a downpour in Seattle).|$|E

500|$|With a {{past as a}} musician, I {{remember}} sometimes {{feeling like}} the audience was against <b>me</b> <b>while</b> I was on stage [...] Even if that wasn't noticeable in any way, I still {{felt as if they}} all disliked me, or at least, misunderstood me, deep inside. That paranoia was kind of firmly rooted inside of me—the fear of being the wrong artist in front of the wrong audience. Thus, the idea for 'She's Madonna' deals with that.|$|E

500|$|For Final Fantasy X-2, regular series {{composer}} Nobuo Uematsu {{was replaced}} by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi of The Bouncer fame. Among the game's more notable tracks are two vocalized songs: the J-pop-style [...] "Real Emotion" [...] and a more slowly-paced ballad, [...] "1000 Words". The Japanese versions of the songs are sung by Kumi Koda, a Japanese music artist who also performed motion capture for the [...] "Real Emotion" [...] opening full motion video and provided the voice of Lenne in the Japanese version of the game. The English versions of the songs are sung by Jade Villalon of Sweetbox. She released extended versions of the songs she sang as bonus tracks on the Japanese release of her album, Adagio. Koda also released her own English versions of the songs on her CD single Come with <b>Me.</b> <b>While</b> similar, the lyrics of Koda Kumi's versions differ from those sung by Jade Villalon.|$|E
500|$|As a man, Richardson {{was on the}} {{one hand}} deeply private and on the other flamboyantly unconventional. Frank Muir said of him, [...] "It's the Ralphdom of Ralph that one has to cling to; he wasn't really quite like other people." [...] In Coveney's phrase, [...] "His oddness was ever startling and never {{hardened}} into mere eccentricity." [...] Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study eating his pencils, or take a pet mouse out for a stroll, but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues. Tynan wrote in The New Yorker that Richardson [...] "made me feel that I have known this man all my life and that I have never met anyone who more adroitly buttonholed <b>me</b> <b>while</b> keeping me firmly at arm's length." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{her first}} appearance, Laura San Giacomo plays Harmony Chase, {{a woman who}} hires Keith to {{investigate}} her cheating husband. The two were both series regulars on the NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me!. The two actors had maintained a close friendship after their sitcom was cancelled, and when Rob Thomas brought up a romantic storyline for Keith to Colantoni, he suggested Giacomo for the role. Giacomo accepted the role, later stating, [...] "It {{was kind of a}} no-brainer situation for me. I love Rico, love working with him, and it was just as much fun as I thought it would be." [...] In addition to sharing in-jokes about Just Shoot <b>Me!</b> <b>while</b> on set, Colantoni also remembered what a good actress he thought she was in their earlier days. After the first appearance, both Colantoni and Giacomo lobbied for more storylines together. Thomas was open to the possibility, saying, [...] "I wouldn't hesitate to go back to this, because I was really happy with how it played out." [...] Giacomo would go on to appear on three episodes of the show.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Sinatra {{released}} Watertown, one of {{his most}} acclaimed concept albums, with music by Bob Gaudio (of the Four Seasons) and lyrics by Jake Holmes. However, it sold a mere 30,000 copies that year and reached a peak chart position of 101. He left Caesars Palace in September that year after an incident where executive Sanford Waterman pulled a gun on him. He performed several charity concerts with Count Basie at the Royal Festival Hall in London. On November 2, 1970, Sinatra recorded the last songs for Reprise Records before his self-imposed retirement, announced the following June at a concert in Hollywood {{to raise money for the}} Motion Picture and TV Relief Fund. He finished the concert with a [...] "rousing" [...] performance of [...] "That's Life", and stated [...] "Excuse <b>me</b> <b>while</b> I disappear" [...] as he left the stage. He told LIFE journalist Thomas Thompson that [...] "I've got things to do, like the first thing is not to do [...] at all for eight months... maybe a year", while Barbara Sinatra later claimed that Sinatra had grown [...] "tired of entertaining people, especially when all they really wanted were the same old tunes he had long ago become bored by". While he was in retirement, President Richard Nixon asked him to perform at a Young Voters Rally in anticipation of the upcoming campaign. Sinatra obliged and chose to sing [...] "My Kind of Town" [...] for the rally held in Chicago on October 20, 1972.|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you on my lips / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way {{they looked at each other}} and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get <b>me</b> <b>while</b> I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E
