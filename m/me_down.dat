5|$|Ultimately, {{given the}} {{negative}} {{reaction to the}} Never Let <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> album and this tour, Bowie found himself creatively exhausted and in low critical standing. Bowie {{decided to return to}} making music for himself, and, having been put in touch with Reeves Gabrels through his publicist for the Glass Spider Tour, Bowie formed his band Tin Machine in 1989 and retired his back catalogue of songs from live performance with his Sound+Vision Tour in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Glass Spider is {{a concert}} film by English writer, singer and actor David Bowie. The release was sourced from eight shows {{during the first}} two weeks of November 1987 at the Sydney Entertainment Centre in Australia during the last month of the Glass Spider Tour. The 86-show tour, which also visited Europe, North America and New Zealand, was in support of Bowie's album Never Let <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> (1987). Originally {{released}} in 1988 on VHS, the tour was choreographed by Toni Basil, directed by David Mallet, and produced by Anthony Eaton. The VHS was released by MPI Home Video in the US and by Video Collection International in the UK.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, the band's new line-up {{embarked}} {{on a large scale}} world tour. Beginning on 10 May 2005 at the London Astoria, and finishing on 31 March 2006 in front of a sold out gig in Mexico City, Oasis played more live shows {{than at any time since}} the Definitely Maybe tour, visiting 26 countries and headlining 113 shows for over 3.2 million people. The tour passed without any major incidents and was the band's most successful in more than a decade. The tour included sold out shows at New York's Madison Square Garden and LA's Hollywood Bowl. A rockumentary film made during the tour, entitled Lord Don't Slow <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> directed by Dick Carruthers was released in October 2007. A second DVD included live footage from an Oasis gig in Manchester from 2 July 2005.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets <b>me</b> <b>down.</b> I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E

5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took <b>me</b> <b>down</b> some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F.

25|$|Tie Me Up! Tie <b>Me</b> <b>Down!</b> {{made its}} world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival to a {{polarized}} critical reaction. In the USA, the film received an X rating by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), and the {{stigma attached to}} the X rating marginalized {{the distribution of the}} film in the country. Miramax, who distributed the film in the US, filed a lawsuit against the MPAA over the X rating, but lost in court. However, in September 1990, the MPAA replaced the X rating with the NC-17 rating. This was helpful to films of explicit nature, like Tie Me Up! Tie <b>Me</b> <b>Down!,</b> that were previously categorized with pornography because of the X rating.|$|E

25|$|Foote's first novel, Tournament, was {{published}} in 1949. It was inspired by his planter grandfather, who had died two years before Foote's birth. For his next novel, Follow <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> (1950), Foote drew heavily from the proceedings of a Greenville murder trial he attended in 1941 for both the plot and characters.|$|E
25|$|Almodóvar's {{next film}} {{marked the end}} of the {{collaboration}} between him and Carmen Maura, and the beginning of a fruitful collaboration with Victoria Abril. Tie Me Up!

25|$|Also in 1989, Miramax {{released}} two arthouse films, The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, {{and director}} Pedro Almodóvar's film Tie Me Up! Tie <b>Me</b> <b>Down!,</b> {{both of which}} the MPAA rating board gave an X-rating, effectively stopping nationwide release for these films. Weinstein sued the MPAA over the rating system. His lawsuit was later thrown out, but the MPAA introduced the NC-17 rating two months later.|$|E

25|$|This certain look transcended {{into the}} R {{world in the}} mid 1990s when Jodeci came onto the scene, who were crooners but with more edgy and sexual look.

25|$|Thile is {{featured}} in the documentary Bluegrass Journey, {{along with the rest}} of Nickel Creek. He has also appeared on a number of other artists' recordings, including Béla Fleck's Perpetual Motion, playing arrangements of Baroque, Impressionist, Classical and other styles of music with Fleck and Edgar Meyer; Jam Session, with Mark O'Connor, Frank Vignola, Bryan Sutton, and Jon Burr; the Dixie Chicks' Home, Kate Rusby's Awkward Annie, Julie Fowlis's Cuilidh, Dolly Parton's Little Sparrow, Dierks Bentley's Up on the Ridge, and Sarah Jarosz's Song Up in Her Head and Follow <b>Me</b> <b>Down.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{populate}} the film with many characters, {{as in his}} previous films, here the story focuses on the compelling relationship at its center: the actress and her kidnapper literally struggling for power and desperate for love. The film's title line Tie Me Up! is unexpectedly uttered by the actress as a genuine request. She does not know if she will try to escape or not, and when she realizes she has feelings for her captor, she prefers not {{to be given a}} chance. In spite of some dark elements, Tie Me Up! Tie <b>Me</b> <b>Down!</b> can be described as a romantic comedy, and the director's most clear love story, with a plot similar to William Wyler's thriller The Collector.|$|E
