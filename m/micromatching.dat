40|$|A compact {{femtosecond}} Ti:sapphire amplifier {{system is}} reported using single-stage multipass configuration with high beam quality. A {{high dispersion glass}} stretcher {{and a pair of}} double prisms for compression are introduced based on broadband femtosecond seed pulses. The non-grating-based pulse stretcher and compressor are advantageous to increase high beam quality and to reduce the high-order dispersion. A Gaussian filter is used to reduce the gain narrowing effect in amplification. The compact femtosecond Ti:sapphire nine-pass amplifier delvers pulses with a duration of 26 fs and an energy of 800 mu J at 7 mJ pumping pulses energy at 1 kHz. The 1 -kHz femtosecond amplifier with a high beam quality and high stability is very suitable for ultrafast physics research applications, such as attosecond science, ultra-precision <b>micromatching,</b> and THz wave generation...|$|E

Users drag terms {{on top of their}} associated definitions to remove them from the grid, and try to clear the grid in the fastest time possible. <b>Micromatch</b> is a related matching game geared towards mobile devices and devices with small screens. Users may access the <b>Micromatch</b> mode on non-mobile devices by manually editing the URL in Match mode to use [...] "micromatch" [...] instead of [...] "match." [...] Match was previously attributed as [...] "Scatter". Though the name of the study mode changed, the game itself did not.|$|R
