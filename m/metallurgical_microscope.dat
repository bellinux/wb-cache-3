Copper Electrode {{was used as a}} tools in this research. EDM is a thermal process that uses spark discharge to erode electrically conductive materials, it’s primarily used for hard metals that very difficult to machine with traditional techniques. EDM tests on a mild steel workpiece were conducted on a sodick AQ 55 L (ATC) EDM Die-Sinking Machine. The surface Roughness tester Series Mahrsurf XR 20 is used to measure Ra and the surface microstructure was examined with a <b>metallurgical</b> <b>microscopes.</b> The EDM machining parameters those were used were peak current, IP (9 A and 18 A), discharge voltage (90 V and 120 V), servo voltage, SV (20 V and 60 V), pulse on-time (100 μs and 300 μs) and pulse off-time (500 μs and 700 μs). The full factorial design of experiment (DOE) from STATISTICA software was used to generate the arrangement of the experiment parameter and the software was used to analyze the effect of each parameter on the machining characteristics.

The agglomeration behavior of PTFE in ethanol and MPL were investigated by laser diffraction, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and <b>metallurgical</b> <b>microscopes.</b> The electronic resistance, pore size distribution, gas permeability and surface hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties were also characterized for prepared gas diffusion layers (GDLs). It was shown that PTFE water dispersion system suffered flocculating when dispersed in ethanol and this agglomeration behavior was reduced by employing Nafion ionomer. With the increase in the Nafion ionomer adopted in the MPL, not only the decreased hydrophobic property was shown in the MPL, but the decreased PTFE particle size was also achieved, which results in improved crosslink of carbon and pores themselves as well as the volume loss of pores in micron scale. The increased gas permeability and electronic conductivity of the GDL made the one employing the PTFE dispersion system with 1 % Nation content own its advantages as the cathode diffusion layer for a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) under near-ambient conditions.
