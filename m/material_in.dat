40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{indicate}} the feature and problem of Patriotism Education of kindergarten in the People’s Republic of China. This study focuses on the kindergarten teaching materials of Beijing and Shanghaia total of 128 teaching materials are the object of analysis. Content Analysis is the method used in analyzing kindergarten teaching materials. This study concludes 2 results. 1) kindergarten teaching <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> Beijing focused on “patriotism” while kindergarten teaching <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> Shanghai focused on “caring”. Frequency of words related to “caring” of kindergarten teaching materials is remarkably higher than its frequency of kindergarten teaching <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> Beijing. 2) Both kindergarten teaching <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> Beijing and Shanghai mentioned valuable themes in term of Patriotism Education. However, traditional culture is taking large proportion of Patriotism Education. Why kindergarten teaching <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> Beijing focused on “patriotism” while kindergarten teaching <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> Shanghai focused on “caring”? This study put the focus on constitute of main editor of two publishers. It was revealed that the arguments of main editors are reflected on the kindergarten teaching materials. Moreover, kindergarten teaching <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> Shanghai are under the control of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission...|$|R

5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to <b>material</b> <b>in</b> Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts.

5|$|Also if {{assuming}} a radius of one AU, then {{there may not}} be sufficient building <b>material</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System to construct a Dyson shell. Anders Sandberg estimates that there is 1.82 kg of easily usable building <b>material</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of 600kg/m2—about 8–20cm thick on average, depending on the density of the material. This includes the hard-to-access cores of the gas giants; the inner planets alone provide only 11.79 kg, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of just 42kg/m2.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies.

40|$|Abstract In an {{atmosphere}} of {{dramatic increase in the}} application of composite <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> aerostructures to benefit from features offered by them, there is a significant need for designing the supply chain of these <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> order to keep them safe from critical quality issues.

5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of <b>material</b> <b>in</b> both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E

40|$|Use {{of solid}} waste in place of {{conventional}} <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> civil engineering structures preserves natural resources and energy and avoids expensive and/or potentially harmful waste disposal. Many studies are investigating the application of waste <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> civil engineering structures. However, {{in an effort to}} find out new areas of waste materials utilization, the environmental impact of the installation of such <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> building structures often remains neglected. This study focused on the environmental aspect of the application of currently investigated waste <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> Croatia with an emphasis on heavy metal content. Heavy metal concentration in steel slag, river sediment, and biomass ash was measured, and the possibility of their use in road construction in accordance with currently valid legislation was assessed...|$|R
