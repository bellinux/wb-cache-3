40|$|Abstract Background Neonatal <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> {{among black}} infants {{are lower than}} {{neonatal}} <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> among white infants at birth weights Methods We used data on births in the United States in 1997 after excluding those with a birth weight Results Perinatal <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> (calculated per convention) were lower among blacks than whites at lower birth weights and at preterm gestational ages, while blacks had higher <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> at higher birth weights and later gestational ages. With the fetuses-at-risk approach, mortality curves did not intersect; blacks had higher <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> at all gestational ages. Increases in birth rates and (especially) growth-restriction rates presaged gestational age-dependent increases in perinatal mortality. Similar findings were obtained in comparisons of smokers versus nonsmokers. Conclusions Formulating perinatal risk based on the fetuses-at-risk approach solves the intersecting perinatal mortality curves paradox; blacks have higher perinatal <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> than whites and smokers have higher perinatal <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> than nonsmokers at all gestational ages and birth weights. </p...|$|R

Although {{alcohol poisoning}} <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> was comparatively high in the former Soviet Republics Russia and Belarus, even during the later-Soviet period, the alarming rise that has occurred during the post-Soviet period means that these countries have one of the highest alcohol poisoning <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in the world. Aims: To estimate the aggregate level effect of alcohol on the alcohol poisoning <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in Russia and Belarus. Method: Trends in alcohol poisoning <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> and alcohol sales per capita from 1970 to 2013 in Russia and Belarus were analyzed employing an ARIMA analysis. Results: Alcohol sales is a statistically significant associated with alcohol poisoning <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in both countries, implying that a 1 -l increase in per capita alcohol sales is associated with an increase in the alcohol poisoning <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> of 9. 0 % in Russia and of 8. 1 % in Belarus.

40|$|There are {{substantial}} geographic variations in {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD) <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in England that may in part be {{due to differences in}} climate and air pollution. An ecological cross-sectional multi-level analysis of male and female CHD <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in all wards in England (1999 – 2004) was conducted to estimate the relative strength of the association between CHD <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> and three aspects of the physical environment - temperature, hours of sunshine and air quality. Models were adjusted for deprivation, an index measuring the healthiness of the lifestyle of populations, and urbanicity. In the fully adjusted model, air quality was not significantly associated with CHD <b>mortality</b> <b>rates,</b> but temperature and sunshine were both significantly negatively associated (p< 0. 05), suggesting that CHD <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> were higher in areas with lower average temperature and hours of sunshine. After adjustment for the unhealthy lifestyle of populations and deprivation, the climate variables explained at least 15 % of large scale variation in CHD <b>mortality</b> <b>rates.</b> The results suggest that the climate has a small but significant independent association with CHD <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in England...|$|R

5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65.

5|$|Aspirin {{overdose}} can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, {{a single}} large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, {{higher than normal}} doses are taken {{over a period of}} time. Acute overdose has a <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/l following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate.|$|E

Such a senescence rate is generally estimated from parameters of a mathematical model fitted to these <b>mortality</b> <b>rates.</b> However, such models have limitations and underlying assumptions. Notably, they do not fit <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> at young and old ages. Therefore, we developed a method to calculate senescence rates from the acceleration of mortality directly without modeling the <b>mortality</b> <b>rates.</b> We applied the different methods to age group-specific mortality data from the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association Registry, including patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis, who are known to suffer from increased senescence rates (n = 302, 455), and patients with a functioning kidney transplant (n = 74, 490). From age 20 to 70, senescence rates were comparable when calculated with or without a model. However, when using non-modeled <b>mortality</b> <b>rates,</b> senescence rates were yielded at young and old ages that remained concealed when using modeled <b>mortality</b> <b>rates.</b> At young ages senescence rates were negative, while senescence rates declined at old ages. In conclusion, the rate of senescence can be calculated directly from non-modeled <b>mortality</b> <b>rates,</b> overcoming the disadvantages of an indirect estimation based on modeled <b>mortality</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
