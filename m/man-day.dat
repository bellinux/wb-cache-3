Labour productivity is also a key concept of construction planning efforts and has a direct interrelationship with the triple constraint mentioned above. The present study reports an investigation of construction labour productivity described as numerical values, i. e. <b>man-day</b> values. First, a general knowledge was given concerning the concept “labour productivity”. Here, the system which is the source of labor productivity rates in Turkey was also introduced and its criticism was carried out. Toward this aim, labour productivity rates of the most fundamental two work items of any construction project (formwork-erecting and reinforcement-fixing) were obtained by means of a questionnaire survey applied to planning engineers, site/project managers, and chief executive officers of about 82 general contractors in the construction industry in Turkey.

50|$|Row and {{industrial}} crops were more remunerative than grain, or at worst provided their cultivators with extra income or consumables (hence {{they were called}} `cash crops'). Their cultivation spread steadily during the late 19th and earlier 20th centuries, and they were increasingly grown as part of improved crop-rotations (see below). Flax and potatoes were grown in the west, north-west, Central Industrial Region and the Urals; sugar-beet in the northern Ukraine and Central Agricultural region; sunflower in south-eastern Russia and the southern Ukraine; cotton in central Asia and Transcaucasia. By 1917 most vegetables {{and industrial}} crops were grown by the peasants. By this time sugar-beet was the only culture to be grown mainly on large estates (and this too largely fell into peasant hands {{as a result of}} the Revolution). These cultures require much more work than grain (hence called `intensive cultures'). Before the mechanization of agriculture potatoes needed 64 <b>man-days</b> of labour a year per desyatin (1 desyatin is about 1.1 hectare), flax or cotton up to 110 <b>man-days,</b> sugar-beet as much as 180.

The various parts of Stonehenge 3 may have involved up to 1.75 million hours (73,000 days or 200 years) of work. The working of the stones is estimated to have required around 20 million hours (830,000 days or 2,300 years) of work using the primitive tools available at the time. Certainly, the will to produce such a site must have been strong, and an advanced social organization would have been necessary to build and maintain it. However, Wally Wallingtons work suggests that Stonehenges construction may have required fewer man-hours than previously estimated.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design; development {{and testing of}} a personal computer-based system to schedule basic training for Federal Armed Forces of Germany (Bundeswehr) conscripts. Each quarter 20, 000 conscripts undergo three months of basic training in over 100 different units. The training objectives fit in 450 training topics which are currently scheduled in a time consummg manual process. An interactive PASCAL program with a graphical user interface heuristically constructs a schedule and accommodates manual changes. The heuristic uses a clock advancing selection algorithm followed by an improvement algorithm. After pre-assigning topics that require a special facility or instructor, the heuristic schedules the remaining topics while satisfying all prerequisites. Extensive testing of the program on realistic data shows that the software produces a high quality schedule with face validity and requires less than ten minutes on an IBM 80486 DX- 2 66 MHz personal computer to construct a schedule for one quarter. It is estimated that quarterly data entry, schedule review and revision with the program would require 1. 5 man-days; {{this is a significant}} savings compared to the 10 to 15 <b>man-days</b> currently needed without the program.
