5|$|In August 2012, {{a scarlet}} ibis {{escaped from the}} zoo and went on the loose in the city after a {{squirrel}} had chewed {{a hole in the}} netting at the top of its cage. Keepers noticed it was missing and later that day it was spotted more than 3 <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> Dundas Street, near the city centre. The ibis was missing for nearly a week before being recaptured four miles from the zoo.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees are Northern Hemisphere animals. When {{red clover}} was {{introduced}} as a crop to New Zealand {{in the nineteenth}} century, it {{was found to have}} no local pollinators, and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year. Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators. In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens, of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied. As planned, red clover was soon being produced from locally-grown seed. Bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses. The New Zealand population of buff-tailed bumblebees naturally colonised Tasmania, 1,500 <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> <b>in</b> 1992.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the major UEFA competitions, Manchester City have also played a number of first team fixtures in other, more minor multi-national competitions. As winners of the 1970 League Cup, Manchester City played against the Coppa Italia winners Bologna in the Anglo-Italian League Cup. The competition started the previous year, {{as a way of}} enabling 1969 League Cup winners Swindon Town to play European opposition. For the first leg in Bologna, the City team stayed over 100km (60 <b>miles)</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> the coastal resort of Rimini, and took a relaxed attitude to proceedings. City lost the match 1–0, and drew 2–2 at home, losing the competition.|$|E

5|$|Kenney assumed {{command of}} the Allied Air Forces on 4 August. Three days later, he instituted a {{sweeping}} reorganization of the Allied Air Forces. The Australian components were assigned to RAAF Command under Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, while the American components were consolidated into the reformed Fifth Air Force under Kenney's personal command. On paper, the organization followed the orthodox pattern, consisting of V Fighter Command under Brigadier General Paul Wurtsmith, V Bomber Command under Walker, and an Air Services Command under Major General Rush B. Lincoln. But Kenney realized {{that he would have}} to maintain his headquarters near MacArthur's GHQ, which moved to Brisbane on 20 July, while the fighting was thousands of <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> New Guinea, with the Fifth Air Force's principal forward bases around Port Moresby. Moreover, Walker's headquarters was in Townsville, as heavy and medium bombers were based there and only staged through Port Moresby. Accordingly, Kenney appointed Whitehead as deputy Fifth Air Force commander, and commander of the Advanced Echelon (ADVON) in Port Moresby.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E
5|$|The ground {{originally}} had {{a capacity of}} about 12,000, but club officials decided that {{was not enough to}} give them any hope of joining the Football League. Some expansion took place in 1887, but in 1891 Newton Heath used what little financial reserves they had to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000spectators. However, this transaction put the club at odds with the railway company, who refused to contribute any finance to the deal. The two organisations began to drift apart from then onwards, and in 1892 the club attempted to raise £2,000 in share capital to pay off the debts incurred by the expansion of the ground. The split also led the railway company to stop paying the rent due on the ground to the cathedral, who {{at about the same time}} decided to increase the rent. Under increasing financial pressure, especially as the cathedral authorities felt it inappropriate for the club to charge admission to the ground, an eviction notice was served on the club in June 1893. The club's management had been searching for a new stadium since the first eviction attempt in May the previous year, and they were able to move to a new ground on Bank Street, three <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> Clayton. It proved impossible though to take the two grandstands to the new ground, and they were sold for £100.|$|E

5|$|Following Manchester United's first league {{title in}} 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, {{it was decided}} that Bank Street was too {{restrictive}} for Davies' ambition and the club would have to move to a new stadium five <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> Old Trafford. Bank Street was sold to the Manchester Corporation for £5,500 and leased back to the club on a monthly basis until the new stadium was complete. Bank Street played host to just 5,000 spectators for its final game on 22 January 1910; a 5–0 home win over Tottenham Hotspur. Manchester United's move away from Bank Street seemed to have come at the perfect time, as, only {{a few days after the}} Tottenham match, one of the stands was blown down in a storm. The roof of the grandstand was blown across the road, landing on the houses opposite, and the stand was left in tatters. The Tottenham match was meant to have been played at Old Trafford, but building problems at the new ground had caused the fixture to revert to Bank Street. Despite the destruction of the Bank Street End stand, the club's reserve team continued to use the ground for matches until the expiry of the lease on 1 January 1912. The remaining timber at the site was then sold to Keyley Bros. for £275. The site had various industrial uses for the next 80 years, until it was cleared for inclusion in the new Manchester Velodrome in the early 1990s. The actual site occupied by the stadium now serves as the Velodrome car park, while a red plaque attached to a house opposite marks the site as part of United's history.|$|E
