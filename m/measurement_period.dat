25|$|Before the {{publication}} of Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home, Sheldrake invited Richard Wiseman, Matthew Smith, and Julie Milton to conduct an independent experimental study with the dog Jaytee. They concluded that their evidence did not support telepathy as {{an explanation for the}} dog's behaviour, and proposed possible alternative explanations for Sheldrake's conclusions, involving artefacts, bias resulting from experimental design, and post hoc analysis of unpublished data. The group observed that Sheldrake's observed patterns could easily arise if a dog were simply to do very little for a while, before visiting a window with increasing frequency the longer that its owner was absent, and that such behaviour would make sense for a dog awaiting its owner's return. Under this behaviour, the final <b>measurement</b> <b>period,</b> ending with the owner's return, would always contain the most time spent at the window. Sheldrake argued that the actual data in his own and in Wiseman's tests did not bear this out, and that the dog went to wait at the window sooner when his owner was returning from a short absence, and later after a long absence, with no tendency for Jaytee to go to the window early in the way that he did for shorter absences.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Section 5.3, short <b>measurement</b> <b>periods</b> for quick load {{adaptation}} results in slightly less overall throughput, i.e., reduced overall network performance. Although smaller buffers improve the network performance, short <b>measurement</b> <b>periods</b> still typically come with reduced throughput. Faster load adaptation resulting in both high overall network performance and targeted proportional throughput differentiation {{may be possible}} by using information below the socket interface. In particular, information on the queuing delay that appears at the MAC layer would provide a quicker feedback on contention and overload than changes in detected throughput and loss at the application layer.|$|R

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the wall composition on the electric consumption when the air conditioner was continuously in use inside the building, the indoor air temperature of the experimental house was maintained at a specific temperature. The <b>measurement</b> <b>periods</b> were summer (July 25, 2008 –September 15, 2008) and winter (December 1, 2008 –March 31, 2009). An air conditioner (Daikin INDUSTRIES, S 28 GTSS-W) was used inside the each house. The air conditioner’s energy consumption efficiency was 5.77 for cooling and 6.27 for heating. The air conditioner was set at three cooling temperatures during the summer (24, 26, and 28  °C) and three heating temperatures during the winter (20, 24, and 28  °C). For each condition, air conditioning was used for 3 – 5  days. During <b>measurement</b> <b>periods,</b> windows were closed.|$|R

40|$|The first EMEP {{intensive}} <b>measurement</b> <b>periods</b> {{were held}} in June 2006 and January 2007. The measurements aimed to characterize the aerosol chemical compositions, including the gas/aerosol partitioning of inorganic compounds. The measurement program during these periods included daily or hourly measurements of the secondary inorganic components, with additional measurements of elementaland organic carbon (EC and OC) and mineral dust in PM 1, PM 2. 5 and PM 10. These measurements have provided extended knowledge regarding the composition of particulate matter and the temporal and spatial variability of PM, {{as well as an}} extended database for the assessment of chemical transport models.

The range of magnetic field exposure was 0. 001 – 0. 50 µT during the ambient period and 0. 41 – 1. 21 µT during the intervention period.
