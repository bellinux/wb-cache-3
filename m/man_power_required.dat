40|$|In {{the process}} of Producer Gas Production; clinker/ash {{is formed as a}} waste material. This clinker is removed by {{equipment}} named as Ash Bowl which rotates on the “Guide Roller” by the application of hydraulic pressure. This process having many problems like formation of large size clinker which require excess hydraulic pressure, guide roller is unable to scatter the hydraulic pressure equally in all the direction on the ash bowl to crush the clinker, more hydraulic pressure is required for the movement of the ash bowl, more time is required to replace the guide roller for its maintenance. In order to eliminate above mention problems, guide roller has been replaced by the thrust bearing which improves productivity by reducing break down time, reducing total <b>man</b> <b>power</b> <b>required</b> & reducing maintenance cost...|$|E

At present the hydraulic press depend on the fixing of die inside the mould cavity with help of mechanical wedges. This kind of die fixing take around four hours and three men for fixing it after every cycle to produce {{a limited number of}} bricks. This project is mainly concentrated to avoid the time consumption and reduce the number of <b>man</b> <b>power</b> <b>required</b> to fix the die. For that the wedges can be replaced with the help of pneumatic cylinder having the capacity to withstand 200 bar pressure to lock the die. The drafting is done by using the solidworks (2012) software and the structural analysis is done by using ANSYS workbench 14. 0 according to the standards.

40|$|The present {{research}} concentrates on automation of retail process that involves customers. One can save on total <b>man</b> <b>power</b> <b>required</b> {{to manage a}} physical retail store and store tills if RFID at item level is implemented in a retail store. One can reduce number of persons at Security / Payment till required at store counter and exit. Although RFID can automate and reduce human errors at payment counters. A commercial transaction takes place the moment a customer (buyer) reaches the store exit gate. The proposed solution implemented will cut down operational cost for retail stores and a business can pass the benefit to customers. It will ease customer shopping by extending shopping hours in retail physical stores. The work that {{has been carried out}} to produce a conceptual system that implements and integrates a RFID based message system with existing transactional based E-commerce applications. The research conducts a comparative overview of the various technological frameworks, together with transaction and data transfer. The researched and the applied architecture for the proposed prototype system minimize changes on the existing applications and network design. The results of the experiment using a prototype are analyzed. The study concludes with the reviews and considers how the issues highlighted may be addressed in order to achieve an improved framework through discussing possible solutions. The prototype system has been successfully developed. With the prototype one can achieve objective of unattended store. The tests have demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} make such system with required security, reliability and scalability. ...|$|E

In this system used various type of sensor such as Temperature, Humidity, pH, Moisture 1, Moisture 2, light intensity, PH_EC sensor. The system measures nitrogen (N), potassium (K), phosphorus (P) using PH_EC sensor in the soil according to soil condition the appropriate fertilizers are mixed in the soil for increasing the crop productivity. Also the System measure moisture, temperature, humidity and light intensity, pH according to that appropriate action will be taken. All the sensors are interface to the ARM 7. The processer will process the data display it and as well as control the solenoid valve when moisture is 20 percent then valve will ON and moisture is 80 percent then valve will OFF. The main advantages of this system are to reduce the <b>man</b> <b>power,</b> electricity, save water and improve the production. With the help of this system the farmer can handle the large field very easily. Keywords—PH EC Sensor for the measurement of N, P, K sensor...|$|R
40|$|Background: Studies {{across the}} country have {{reported}} a decline in the rate of HIV and HBsAg in the urban population and {{there is a lack of}} data on rate and pattern of theses infections in the rural part. To conduct community based seroprevalence studies, funds, facilities and <b>man</b> <b>power</b> are <b>required.</b> Clinical data collected by hospitals can help in estimating the disease burden due to these viruses in the community. In this backdrop, the present study was designed to estimate the seropositivity for these viruses in a hospital based population. Materials and Methods: Patients reporting to this hospital with various diagnoses, who were advised to undergo HIV and HBsAg testing, were included in this study. The HIV testing was done as per the NACO guidelines and HBsAg was confirmed with two different tests. All the data was analysed by Chi-square test. Results: A year wise seropositivity showed significant decline in HIV and HBsAg cases from this part of the country. The overall seropositivty for HIV and HBsAg was 1. 25 % and 2. 0 % respectively. Male predominance was observed with maximum positivity among the active age group. Maximum positivity rate of 76 % and 74 % fo...|$|R
40|$|The actual {{effectiveness}} of the American anti-war movement from 1964 - 68 and its attempts to sway the policy of President Johnson's administration {{on the topic of}} the Vietnam War is debatable. While popular myth has exaggerated the role of protestors in stopping the war, the movement failed to alter state policy on the war in any serious fashion. The anti-war movement could not develop a universal policy of their aims, differing from a gradual exit from Vietnam to a complete anarchist overthrow of the American system, and as such were unable to lobby the government effectively. Within the war itself, however, the Johnson administration and the United States Military encountered a stronger stimulus to reconsider their involvement: the inability to adapt to a guerilla war, the immense <b>man</b> <b>power</b> and resources <b>required</b> to ensure victory, and ultimately the communist Tet offensive of 1968 pushing American forces back.

In {{the cotton}} zone of Central African Republic, farmers have diversified their {{activities}} despite {{the weakness of}} the family <b>man</b> <b>power.</b> This study was to understand management practices of <b>man</b> <b>power</b> that allowed farmers to insure the diversification of their activities. The progress of this study is based on a close follow up of 30 farms during three agricultural seasons. In addition observations on the global management practices of farms, coupled to discussions with the farmers and their family, has allowed to complete data collected during the follow up. Results have shown that farmers have realized the diversification of activities by having recourse to the external work force which represented on an average 42 % of the total <b>man</b> <b>power</b> used on the exploitation. This diversification has allowed them to have monetary incomes all along the year and has limited risks of unbalance between incomes and expenses, leading to the stability of treasury.

50|$|Since {{mechanical}} {{power can be}} defined as force times velocity, in one dimension, and force is equivalent to mass times acceleration, then the minimum <b>power</b> <b>required</b> for a wheelie can be expressed as the product of mass, velocity, and the minimum acceleration required for a wheelie:Thus the minimum <b>power</b> <b>required</b> is directly proportional to the mass of the vehicle and to its velocity. The slower a vehicle is moving, the less <b>power</b> is <b>required</b> to perform a wheelie, and that is without even considering the <b>power</b> <b>required</b> to overcome air drag, which increases with the cube of velocity.

This study aimed to assess the human resources in Shahid Kaamyab and Shahid Hashemi Nejad hospitals of Mashhad. Material and Methods : In this cross-sectional descriptive study, two hospitals affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences were assessed in 2013. The study tool included 14 standard checklists derived from the Ministry of Health and Medical Education's <b>man</b> <b>power</b> standards. The collected data contained <b>man</b> <b>power</b> data of all departments, paraclinical, logistics, wards of participating hospitals and their bed occupancy rate. The data were analyzed using SPSS 16. Results : The findings showed that comparing to the Ministry's standards, the assessed hospitals confronted with shortages in human resources. The hospitals demonstrated shortages in <b>man</b> <b>power</b> in physical therapy, pharmacy, laundry, office, and nursing units.
