5|$|Ninja Gaiden was Team Ninja's first action title. Its initial concept {{had nothing}} in common with the {{original}} Ninja Gaiden series that was released for the NES. However, for retail reasons Tecmo wanted to retain a link with the previous games, which had many adherents in the West, so Itagaki was asked to rethink his ideas to target the foreign market. Analysing the earlier games, he concluded that their violence appealed to players, and included gory content, such as beheadings, in the Xbox game to retain that spirit. He also aimed to make his new game hard but alluring; it would challenge players on their reflexes rather than on their memories of layouts and timings. His team made a point of designing smoothly-flowing gameplay with high-quality animations that reacted quickly to the player's input. Itagaki paid homage to the earlier Ninja Gaiden series by including updated versions of foes and special attacks. Team Ninja based their 3D computer models, from the pistols of the henchman upwards, on real world material. Character models were taken from studies of human anatomy, and the team hired martial artists in order to digitally capture their movement. Rather than import the motion captures directly into the game, however, the animators used them as templates to give a sense of realism to the game characters' exaggerated movements. Itagaki found it <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> design nonhuman creatures than human enemies.|$|E

Ellipsometry is also becoming <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> researchers in other disciplines such as biology and medicine. These areas pose new challenges to the technique, such as measurements on unstable liquid surfaces and microscopic imaging.|$|E
25|$|If {{skills and}} customs don't {{work in the}} new situation, these die out, or those holding them do. Children adapt {{naturally}} to the new situation, and immediately useful customs and skills are <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> them than reading and writing.

25|$|Coincidentally {{there was}} a circus in Charlottetown during the conference, and it was much <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> the {{majority}} of the population. There was no one working at the public wharf at the foot of Great George Street when the Canadian delegates arrived on the steamship SS Victoria, so Prince Edward Island representative William Henry Pope had to handle receptions by himself, including rowing out to greet the new arrivals. The Canadian delegates stayed each night on board the SS Queen Victoria, as circus-goers and the Maritime delegates had taken up the accommodations in town.|$|E
25|$|Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001), {{directed}} by Christophe Gans, {{is a popular}} feature film based on the legend. The film took several creative liberties {{in order to make}} the story <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> a general audience. Rather than a wolf or wolf-dog crossbreed, the movie portrays the creature as the offspring of a lion crossbred with another unknown big cat, equipped with armor to make it seem more threatening. The Beast is the instrument of the film's eponymous secret organisation, which attempts to undermine public confidence in the king and ultimately take over the country by stating that the Beast is a divine punishment for the King's indulgence of the modern embrace of science over religion.|$|E
25|$|Keillor formed most of {{his ideas}} for Lake Wobegon while working at public radio station KSJR {{on the campus of}} St. John's University in Collegeville; Avon, where he lived; and local towns such as Albany, Freeport, Cold Spring, Richmond, Rockville, St. Joseph, St. Stephen, St. Wendell and Holdingford. Stearns County was {{predominantly}} German and Catholic in the 1970s, and the second most Catholic county in the USA (second only to New Orleans). In order to balance the religious and ethnic demography of the physical location in Stearns County with the rest of Minnesota, Keillor 'imported' the Lutheran and Scandinavian elements into the mythical town, making it more identifiable and therefore <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> the rest of the state.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 17th to 19th centuries, boxing bouts were {{motivated}} by money, as the fighters competed for prize money, promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result. The modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908. In their current form, Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited {{to three or four}} rounds, scoring is computed by points {{based on the number of}} clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts. Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an Automated Boxing Scoring System, which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> spectators. Professional boxing remains by far the most popular form of the sport globally, though amateur boxing is dominant in Cuba and some former Soviet republics. For most fighters, an amateur career, especially at the Olympics, serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation for a professional career.|$|E

500|$|In January 1995, Thompson {{presented}} a draft to Lee, Doran, co-producer Laurie Borg, and others {{working on the}} production, {{and spent the next}} two months editing the screenplay based upon their feedback. Thompson would continue making revisions throughout production of the film, including altering scenes to meet budgetary concerns, adding dialogue changes, and changing certain aspects to better fit the actors. Brandon's confession scene, for instance, initially included flashbacks and stylised imagery before Thompson decided it was [...] "emotionally <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> let Brandon tell the story himself and find it difficult." ...|$|E

500|$|Two film {{industry}} trade journals gave the film positive reviews. Todd McCarthy of Variety felt Adamson's direction had a [...] "surer sense of cinematic values" [...] and praised the improved special effects, the [...] "timeless" [...] locations and production design. On the performances, he felt [...] "the four kids overall have more character {{and are therefore}} <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> watch than they were before, and Italian actor Castellitto registers strongly with evil that's implacable but not overplayed." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter noted the film was darker than its predecessor, with [...] "the loss of innocence theme ... significantly deepened". He highlighted Peter Dinklage's performance, which [...] "outmaneuver the title character as Narnia's most colorful new inhabitant";.|$|E
500|$|The teleplay {{was written}} by Kenneth Biller and Taylor; Biller wrote the A-story {{that focused on the}} swarm of alien creatures while Taylor focused on the B-story of Kes' elogium. [...] Instead of writing from Digg's full prose story, Biller worked from a seven-page treatment. [...] Biller [...] reacted to the plot with the thought: [...] "a show about eating and sex — these are things I know a lot about…" [...] Biller {{explained}} in a later interview that he fought for Neelix and Kes to already be living together and having sex when drafting the teleplay, but he was shot down by Taylor and Rick Berman out of concern for Kes' young age {{and that it would be}} <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> show the couple grappling with this for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle {{criticized the}} story, pacing, and Phoenix's character. He also opined {{that the film}} was [...] "a lot <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> think about than watch". J. R. Jones of the Chicago Reader gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, praising the {{performances}} of Phoenix and Johansson, but also criticizing Phoenix's character, calling him an [...] "idiot". He also criticized the lack of realism {{in the relationship between}} Phoenix and Johansson's characters. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice opined that Jonze was [...] "so entranced with his central conceit that he can barely move beyond it", and criticized the dialogue as being [...] "premeditated." [...] However, she also praised Johannson's performance, calling it [...] "the movie's saving grace" [...] and stating that Her [...] "isn't just unimaginable without Johansson—it might have been unbearable without her".|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the animals}} living in Jockey's Ridge have adapted to the environment. Most of them are nocturnal to combat the summer heat, so {{visitors}} don't see them.

500|$|In {{writing the}} script for [...] "Subway", Yoshimura wanted the Pembleton {{character}} to be confronted with his own mortality, a theme that had continued from the previous season in which the character suffered a stroke. Although Pembleton does not typically discuss his own feelings, Yoshimura {{wanted him to be}} placed in a situation in which he not only discussed death, but is also led by the unique circumstance of Lange's subway incident to confide his stroke experience to an almost complete stranger. From the beginning of the writing process, Yoshimura specifically wanted the Lange character to be mean and unpleasant, rather than the nice and innocent victim more typically portrayed in such television episodes: [...] "Tragedy can happen to jerky people too and I think it'd be much <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see how that kind of character's circumstances transcends the typical cliched TV kind of victim." ...|$|E
500|$|Development then shifted {{focus to}} the enemies. Landers were given the ability to capture humans, and a new enemy was devised from the mechanic: [...] "Mutants", {{captured}} humans that had turned hostile. The Mutants added a rescue element to the game that Jarvis believed made it <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> players and encouraged them to continue playing. The element of making a [...] "comeback" [...] from a dire situation {{was applied to the}} planet as well. Jarvis felt it mimicked {{the ups and downs of}} real life. [...] "Bombers", enemies which release floating bombs on the screen, were added next. More enemies were added to create different gameplay elements. [...] "Swarmers" [...] and [...] "Pods" [...] were designed to attack the spaceship as opposed to the astronauts. [...] "Baiters" [...] were included to add pressure to the player by preventing them from lingering. The enemies quickly follow the spaceship to collide with it, and were based on a similar enemy in Asteroids.|$|E
500|$|Production {{designer}} Cory Kaplan {{explains how}} she was attracted {{to the idea of}} using primitive materials when she states, [...] "We all see super-tech now, but the idea of low-tech was much <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> me, much more visual. So, you take elements of rock and steel and chisel them into interesting shapes." [...] She also describes the creation of the set by stating, [...] "I found the backdrop from Alien, and Bill Roe lit it very dimly and put it behind. And it was just this rotating platform with this humongous dental piece that could rotate around as well and pull his face apart." [...] According to Makeup Supervisor Cheri Montasanto-Medcalf, Matthew Mungle helped {{in the creation of the}} alien torture machine by making the cheeks and putting the hooks in. The makeup supervisor adds that the hooks would actually stretch out and that David Duchovny [...] "sat pretty good through all that." ...|$|E

500|$|... "A New Day in the Old Town" [...] was co-written by {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman and co-creator J.J. Abrams, with Goldsman also {{serving as}} director. In the DVD special features, actor Joshua Jackson explained {{the second season}} begins {{less than a day}} after the previous season's finale, [...] "so the characters have only just barely had a chance to catch their breath from all the madness in the first season, and launch right back into the second one". Co-executive producer Jeff Pinkner considered beginning the second season directly after first season's final scene between Olivia and William Bell, but changed his mind because {{he thought it would be}} <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> show how Olivia's disappearance and reappearance affected the Fringe team, as well as the rest of the season. The scene between Olivia and Bell is consequently not shown until the season's fourth episode, [...] "Momentum Deferred". The premiere began the [...] "gun arc" [...] storyline, which commenced with Olivia hurtling out of her SUV and becoming too weak to control her gun during her physical recovery, and ended with the killing of the shapeshifter posing as Charlie Francis in [...] "Momentum Deferred".|$|E
500|$|Derek Yu from The Indie Games Source {{compared}} {{the game with}} Portal and stated that Chung was able to develop [...] "an impeccable flair for graphic design" [...] while manufacturing Gravity Bone.

[...] Yu elaborated that it had [...] "enough panache in its two levels to make it somewhat of an indie sleeper hit {{of the end of}} 2008." [...] An editor from The Refined Geek was pleased with Gravity Bone and its sequel, Thirty Flights of Loving, awarding them each a score of 8 out of 10 and stating, [...] "the enjoyment from these games comes from noticing all the subtle environmental clues and then using your imagination to draw the connecting dots." [...] The editor commented that both games highlight story elements over graphics and technical innovations, saying each game's [...] "true strength comes from its ability to tell a story in the extremely short time frame." ...|$|E
500|$|The South China Morning Post {{praised the}} game's formula, noting that it {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} previous open-ended Maxis games. Comparing to SimCity 2000, the review remarked that it was <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> watch people live out their lives in a tower rather than to observe cars moving around. They also appreciated the [...] "homely" [...] feeling of SimTower, in contrast with other Sim games such as SimEarth and SimLife, which they felt were too universal to take on a personal identity. Benjamin Svetkey of Entertainment Weekly praised the game and commented that it is [...] "more fun than [...] sounds". However, he stated that the gameplay may be too much for fans of the series. A reviewer for Next Generation panned the game, saying it lacks the bustling interactivity of previous games in the Sim franchise: [...] "There are bug infestations and the occasional fire with which to deal, but most of the time, SimTower sees you standing around waiting for cash reserves to grow in order to add more floors. Not much fun at all." [...] Australia's The Age found SimTower a pleasing return to form for Maxis, after the release of the disappointing SimFarm. Lisa Karen Savignano of Allgame stated that the game had decent graphics and sound. However, she also felt that SimTower had good replay value due to the non-linear gameplay, giving the game 4 stars out of 5.|$|E
