5|$|<b>Matić</b> {{took part}} in Chelsea's trophy {{ceremony}} in full kit despite being suspended, similar to what Terry had done after Chelsea won the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final with him suspended. Mourinho did not concur with the official man of the match award going to Terry, stating that the honour {{should have gone to}} Thibaut Courtois and Filipe Luís for their performances against Liverpool, and Andreas Christensen for his performance against Shrewsbury Town.|$|E
5|$|Since {{their first}} {{competitive}} match, more than 750 players {{have made a}} competitive first-team appearance for the club, {{many of whom have}} played between 25 and 99 matches. Dimas, Tahar El Khalej and Nemanja <b>Matić</b> all fell one short of 100 appearances, as they all moved elsewhere while the season was ongoing. Four former players went on to be first-team managers: Cosme Damião, Ribeiro dos Reis, Vítor Gonçalves and Cândido Tavares. Hugo Leal, who appeared 41 times for the club, is the youngest player to have played for Benfica. He was 16 years and 335 days when he played against Sporting de Espinho on 20 April 1997. Axel Witsel and Ederson hold the club record sale at €40 million each, while Raúl Jiménez is the record purchase at €21.8 million. Nemanja <b>Matić</b> is the only player listed to have been selected as Primeira Liga Player of the Year. Of the players still at the club, Raúl Jiménez is the closest to 100 appearances; he has played in 94 matches.|$|E
5|$|As of 8 August 2017, a {{total of}} 465 players have played fewer than 25 {{competitive}} matches for the club. Four former players – John Scott, Ted Buckle, Eddie Lewis and Michael Clegg – each made 24 appearances during their spell at Manchester United. The most recent players to make their debuts for the club are Swedish defender Victor Lindelöf, Serbian midfielder Nemanja <b>Matić</b> and Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku on 8 August 2017 in the 2017 UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea midfielder Nemanja <b>Matić</b> was {{suspended}} for the final, due to a two-match ban he received for pushing over Burnley's Ashley Barnes in a league match on 21 February 2015. Another central midfielder for the club, John Obi Mikel, missed the match through a knee injury. Due to Matić's absence, Kurt Zouma – usually a central defender – moved into defensive midfield, with Gary Cahill introduced into Zouma's previous position. Chelsea made four other changes from their draw with Burnley: Petr Čech started in goal in place of Thibaut Courtois, César Azpilicueta at left-back instead of Filipe Luís, and Ramires and Willian came into the midfield {{at the expense of}} Juan Cuadrado and Oscar. Chelsea set up with a three-man attack, with Eden Hazard and Willian wide of Diego Costa.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea were {{predicted}} {{to line up}} in a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Willian and Eden Hazard as wide men. Mourinho doubted the fitness of Diego Costa and Gary Cahill going into the match – the former aggravated his hamstring during a pre-season game against Barcelona. Arsenal were expected to line up similarly to Chelsea, with Walcott furthest forward and Mesut Özil in his preferred position as playmaker. Midfielder Jack Wilshere was ruled out of selection, having sustained an ankle injury during training. Arsenal's top scorer of the previous season, Alexis Sánchez, was rested, having won the 2015 Copa América with Chile earlier in the summer. The teamsheets showed Loïc Rémy starting the match for Chelsea up front and Cesc Fàbregas partnering <b>Matic</b> in midfield. As expected Petr Čech started in goal for Arsenal; the goalkeeper moved from Chelsea in search of first-team football.|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas {{was linked}} with a {{move away from}} the London after he was an unused {{substitution}} in the 2016–17 Premier League opener against West Ham. On 20 August 2016, Fàbregas once again started on the bench against Watford, entering the match in the second half to replace Nemanja <b>Matić</b> and creating an assist for Diego Costa, who scored the winner in a 2–1 victory. In the post-match press conference, Fàbregas earned the praise of manager, Conte, for his inspiring performance in the comeback win as well as the attitude he shows during training sessions. Fàbregas's first two goals of the season came in an EFL Cup tie against Leicester City on 20 September, both coming within two minutes of each other in extra time to win the game 4–2, the victory moving Chelsea on to the Round of 16.|$|E

5|$|Then 25-year-old Marc Burns, an Auburn University {{graduate}} from Port-of-Spain on Trinidad, represented Trinidad and Tobago in the 100meters at Beijing. His participation marked his third Olympic games (2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens) {{and his second}} time running the event for Trinidad and Tobago. Burns raced during the August 14 qualification round in the ninth heat, where he completed his race in 10.46seconds. Burns came in second and tied Slovenia's <b>Matic</b> Osovnikar, falling behind Qatari sprinter Samuel Adelebari Francis (10.40seconds). Burns and Osovnikar finished ahead of Honduran athlete Cruz Rolando Palacios Castillo (10.49seconds). Tying Osovnikar and Germany's Tobias Benjamin Unger for 38th place out of 80 athletes, Burns advanced to quarterfinals.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea, {{in their}} usual home strip of blue, kicked-off the match and {{immediately}} lost possession when Walcott dispossessed <b>Matic.</b> Walcott sent {{the ball to}} Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose cross on the right forced a punch from Thibaut Courtois. Francis Coquelin conceded a free kick in the sixth minute having fouled Willian inside Chelsea's half, though nothing came of the set piece. Fàbregas went down under the challenge of Per Mertesacker in Arsenal's penalty area soon afterwards, but his appeal for a penalty kick was turned down by referee Anthony Taylor and play resumed. Chelsea, having settled the slower of the two teams, began to dominate ball possession and won two early corners, {{both of which were}} easily dealt with. In the 17th minute, Nacho Monreal's charge forward was stopped by Cahill; the Chelsea defender in the process of making that challenge had suffered a nose bleed. A free kick for Arsenal presented a chance for Walcott to score, but his header goalwards was saved.|$|E
