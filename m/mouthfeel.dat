5|$|The {{following}} May, {{the band}} entered Zero Return Studios in Atlanta with drummer Curt Wells as producer {{for their first}} album in almost a decade. On January 25, 2005, Magnapop released <b>Mouthfeel</b> on Amy Ray's record label Daemon Records and supported it with a tour through the United States. By 2005, Fletcher had left the group, and drummer Chad Williams had been recruited to replace him on two weeks prior to the first show on the <b>Mouthfeel</b> tour that included an appearance at South by Southwest. One of these performances was recorded for the band's first live album—Magnapop Live at Maxwell's 03/09/2005—which they released independently through online music distributors including eMusic, the iTunes Store, and Rhapsody. In May 2006, the band completed a tour of Belgium and The Netherlands and returned to Atlanta to begin work on the followup to <b>Mouthfeel.</b> They continued touring Europe in 2007 and completed writing and recording for a new album sometime prior to 2008, with the album initially slated {{to be released in}} summer 2009. These sessions recorded with Brian Paulson were released as Chase Park on September 4, 2009, through digital distributors by the band's own, newly created label, The Kraft Records.|$|E
5|$|Draught {{beer from}} a {{pressurised}} keg using a lever-style dispenser and a spout {{is the most}} common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. Nitrogen produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense head and a creamy <b>mouthfeel.</b> Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called beer balls. In traditional pubs, the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beer's logo and trademark.|$|E
5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and <b>mouthfeel.</b> Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|E
5|$|Magnapop {{have been}} defined genre-wise as power pop by {{multiple}} rock critics, and their performances have drawn comparisons with punk, new wave, and surf rock. Reviewers have {{commented on the}} band's pop-influenced songwriting, specifically their employment of guitar hooks and simple chord structure. To that end, they have been compared to Mould's previous work {{as a member of}} Sugar and Hüsker Dü, as well as fellow Georgia-based rock acts such as Guadalcanal Diary and Let's Active and alternative rock pioneers Pixies and The Replacements. The album Rubbing Doesn't Help represented a stylistic shift for the band away from their more pop-inspired material toward more guitar-oriented rock, but their comeback with <b>Mouthfeel</b> returned to the more pop-inspired sound of Hot Boxing.|$|E
25|$|The {{change in}} <b>mouthfeel</b> {{is related to}} the {{increase}} in pH, but may also be due to the production of polyols, particularly the sugar alcohols erythritol and glycerol. Another factor that may enhance the <b>mouthfeel</b> of wines that have gone through malolactic fermentation is the presence of ethyl lactate which can be as high as 110mg/l after MLF.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenolic}} {{content in}} wine {{refers to the}} phenolic compounds—natural phenol and polyphenols—in wine, which include {{a large group of}} several hundred chemical compounds that affect the taste, color and <b>mouthfeel</b> of wine. These compounds include phenolic acids, stilbenoids, flavonols, dihydroflavonols, anthocyanins, flavanol monomers (catechins) and flavanol polymers (proanthocyanidins). This large group of natural phenols can be broadly separated into two categories, flavonoids and non-flavonoids. Flavonoids include the anthocyanins and tannins which contribute to the color and <b>mouthfeel</b> of the wine. The non-flavonoids include the stilbenoids such as resveratrol and phenolic acids such as benzoic, caffeic and cinnamic acids.|$|E
25|$|The texture is also heavily {{influenced}} by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus have a smoother texture and <b>mouthfeel,</b> regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} of adding sugar to grape must {{has been part}} of the process of winemaking since the Romans added honey as a sweetening agent. While not realizing the chemical components, Roman winemakers were able to identify the benefits of added sense of body or <b>mouthfeel.</b>|$|E
25|$|The wine {{has been}} {{described}} as 'velvety' or 'unctuous'. The characteristic fruit flavor is plum, sometimes tending towards prune. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, Pomerols can have, in addition to the characteristic plum notes, honeyed spice, truffles, peppermint, chocolate, roasted nuts and raisin notes with a creamy, sometimes buttery <b>mouthfeel</b> and supple tannins.|$|E
25|$|Master of Wine Clive Coates {{describes}} the wines having rich flavours of chocolate, black cherries and mocha with a silky smooth <b>mouthfeel.</b> Younger examples {{will have a}} fresh raspberry flavour typical of Grenache. In regards to food and wine pairing, Coates notes that Maury {{are one of the}} rare wines that pair well with chocolate desserts.|$|E
25|$|Usually, an {{emulsifying}} agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, {{though a}} few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes {{at the cost of}} a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them {{to reduce the amount of}} cocoa butter while maintaining the same <b>mouthfeel.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{primary role}} of malolactic {{fermentation}} is to deacidify wine. It can also affect the sensory {{aspects of a}} wine, making the <b>mouthfeel</b> seem smoother and adding potential complexity in the flavor and aroma of the wine. For these other reasons, most red wines throughout the world (as well as many sparkling wines and nearly 20% of the world's white wines) today go through malolactic fermentation.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen {{levels in}} the wine can have an {{influence}} on many sensory aspects of the resulting wine, including the synthesis of many aromatic compounds. Fusel alcohols are made by the degradation of amino acids though {{in the presence of}} high levels of ammonia and urea their production is reduced. When available nitrogen is limited, the levels of glycerol and trehalose, which may influence <b>mouthfeel,</b> are higher.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the {{principle}} in practice would be a wine that someone acquires when it is 9 years of age, but finds it dull. A year later the drinker finds this wine very pleasing in texture, aroma and <b>mouthfeel.</b> Under the Coates Law of Maturity the wine {{will continue to be}} drunk at an optimal maturation for that drinker until it has reached 20 years of age at which time those positive traits that the drinker perceives will start to fade.|$|E
25|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} {{tends to}} create a rounder, fuller <b>mouthfeel.</b> Malic acid is typically associated with the taste of green apples, while lactic acid is richer and more buttery tasting. Grapes produced in cool regions tend to be high in acidity, much of which comes from the contribution of malic acid. Malolactic fermentation generally enhances the body and flavor persistence of wine, producing wines of greater palate softness. Many winemakers also feel that better integration of fruit and oak character can be achieved if malolactic fermentation occurs during the time the wine is in barrel.|$|E
25|$|In red wine, up to 90% of the wine's {{phenolic}} content {{falls under}} the classification of flavonoids. These phenols, mainly derived from the stems, seeds and skins are often leached out of the grape during the maceration period of winemaking. The amount of phenols leached is known as extraction. These compounds contribute to the astringency, color and <b>mouthfeel</b> of the wine. In white wines the number of flavonoids is reduced due to the lesser contact with the skins that they receive during winemaking. There is on-going study into {{the health benefits of}} wine derived from the antioxidant and chemopreventive properties of flavonoids.|$|E
25|$|Pakistani {{dishes are}} known for having {{aromatic}} and sometimes spicy flavors. Some dishes contain liberal amounts of oil, which contribute to a richer, fuller <b>mouthfeel</b> and flavour. Brown cardamom, green cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, and black pepper are {{the most commonly used}} spices in the making {{of a wide variety of}} dishes throughout Pakistan. Cumin seeds, chili powder, turmeric and bay leaves are also very popular. In the Punjab province, it is further diluted with coriander powder. Garam masala (a mixture of aromatic spices) is a very popular blend of spices used in many Pakistani dishes.|$|E
25|$|Malic acid can {{be further}} reduced during the {{winemaking}} process through malolactic fermentation or MLF. In this process, bacteria convert the stronger malic acid into the softer lactic acid; formally, malic acid is polyprotic (contributes multiple protons, here two), while lactic acid is monoprotic (contributes one proton), and thus has only half the effect on acidity (pH); also, the first acidity constant (pKa) of malic acid (3.4 at room temperature) {{is lower than the}} (single) acidity constant of lactic acid (3.86 at room temperature), indicating stronger acidity. Thus after MLF, wine has a higher pH (less acidic), and a different <b>mouthfeel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{benefits}} associated with lees contact deals with the influence on the wine of the mannoproteins released during the autolysis of the yeast cells. Composed primarily of mannose and proteins, with some glucose, mannoproteins are often bound in the cell wall of yeast with hydrophobic aroma compounds that become volatilized as the cell wall breaks down. Not only does the release of mannoproteins impart sensory changes in the wine but they can contribute to tartrate and protein stability, help enhance the body and <b>mouthfeel</b> of the wine as well as decrease the perception of bitterness and astringency of tannins.|$|E
25|$|Cabernet Franc shares many of {{the same}} {{phenolic}} and aroma compounds as Cabernet Sauvignon but with some noticeable differences. Cabernet Franc tends to be more lightly pigmented and produces wines with the same level of intensity and richness. Cabernet Franc tends to have a more pronounced perfume with notes of raspberries, blackcurrants, violets and graphite. It is often characterized by a green, vegetal strike that can range from leaves to green bell peppers. It has slightly less tannins than Cabernet Sauvignon and tends to produce a wine with a smoother <b>mouthfeel.</b> New World examples of Cabernet Franc tend to emphasize the fruit more and may delay harvesting the grapes to try to minimize the green leafy notes.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} between free-run and pressed juice is that pressed juice often has lower acidity levels, higher potassium and pH level, more phenolic compounds such as tannins and more suspended solids such as natural gum and proteins. Some of these attributes can be positive {{influences on the}} wine with the increased phenolics offering more body, aroma characteristics (such as the varietal aromas from terpenes) and aging potential. Other attributes may have more negative influence such as increased astringency and bitterness, precursor for browning pigments in white wine, <b>mouthfeel</b> and balance issues (as well as potential microbial instability) from the increased pH and the enhance need for fining agents {{to assist in the}} clarification and stabilization of the wine with the increase in suspended solids.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of alcohol (particularly ethanol) {{in the wine}} contributes {{much more than just}} intoxication. It has an immense impact of the weight and <b>mouthfeel</b> of the wine as well as the balance of sweetness, tannins and acids. In wine tasting, the anaesthetic qualities of ethanol reduces the sensitivity of the palate to the harsh effects of acids and tannins, making the wine seem softer. It also plays a role during the ageing of wine in its complex interaction with esters and phenolic compounds that produce various aromas in wine that contribute to a wine's flavor profile. For this reason, some winemakers will value having a higher potential alcohol level and delay harvesting until the grapes have a sufficiently high concentration of sugars.|$|E
25|$|Coteaux du Layon Villages AOC A sub-appellation of the Coteaux du Layon AOC, this wine region covers six communes {{along the}} Layon river that have {{historically}} produced wines of high quality. The six communes are Beaulieu-sur-Layon, Faye-d'Anjou, Rablay-sur-Layon, Rochefort-sur-Loire, Saint-Aubin-de-Luigné and Saint-Lambert-du-Lattay. According to wine expert Tom Stevenson, there are noticeable {{differences among the}} wines produced by each commune (all made from Chenin blanc) with the wines of Beaulieu-sur-Layon being characterized by their light aromas; Faye-d'Anjou wines having a distinctive brushwood aroma; Rablay-sur-Layon wines {{tend to be the}} most bold and round; the wines of Rochefort-sur-Loire tend to be full bodied and have the most aging potential; Saint-Aubin-de-Luigné wines are characterized by their delicate aromas that develop over time and the wines of Saint-Lambert-du-Lattay often have very round <b>mouthfeel</b> and robust flavors.|$|E
25|$|Tannins {{refer to}} the diverse group of {{chemical}} compounds in wine that can affect the color, aging ability and texture of the wine. While tannins cannot be smelled or tasted, they can be perceived during wine tasting by the tactile drying sensation and sense of bitterness that they can leave in the mouth. This {{is due to the}} tendency of tannins to react with proteins, such as the ones found in saliva. In food and wine pairing, foods that are high in proteins (such as red meat) are often paired with tannic wines to minimize the astringency of tannins. However, many wine drinkers find the perception of tannins to be a positive trait—especially as it relates to <b>mouthfeel.</b> The management of tannins in the winemaking process is a key component in the resulting quality.|$|E
25|$|Tasting {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the sensory analysis (also referred to as organoleptic analysis) of wine. Employing a trained or consumer panel, oenologists may perform a variety of tests on the taste, aroma, <b>mouthfeel</b> and appeal of wines. Difference tests are important in determining whether different fermentation conditions or new vineyard treatments alter the character of a wine, something particularly important to producers who aim for consistency. Preference testing establishes consumer preference, while descriptive analysis determines the most prominent traits of the wine, some of which grace back labels. Blind tasting and other laboratory controls help mitigate bias and assure statistically significant results. Many large wine companies now boast their own sensory team, optimally consisting of a Ph.D. sensory scientist, a flavor chemist and a trained panel.|$|E
25|$|Mannitol {{increases}} {{blood glucose}} {{to a lesser}} extent than sucrose (thus having a relatively low glycemic index) so is used as a sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Although mannitol has a higher heat of solution than most sugar alcohols, its comparatively low solubility reduces the cooling effect usually found in mint candies and gums. However, when mannitol is completely dissolved in a product, it induces a strong cooling effect. Also, it has a very low hygroscopicity – it does not pick up water from the air until the humidity level is 98%. This makes mannitol very useful as a coating for hard candies, dried fruits, and chewing gums, and it is often included as an ingredient in candies and chewing gum. The pleasant taste and <b>mouthfeel</b> of mannitol also makes it a popular excipient for chewable tablets.|$|E
25|$|As {{red wine}} ages, the harsh tannins of its youth {{gradually}} {{give way to}} a softer <b>mouthfeel.</b> An inky dark color will eventually lose its depth of color and begin to appear orange at the edges, and then later eventually turning brown. These changes occur due to the complex chemical reactions of the phenolic compounds of the wine. In processes that begin during fermentation and continue after bottling, these compounds bind together and aggregate. Eventually these particles reach a certain size where they are too large to stay suspended in the solution and precipitate out. The presence of visible sediment in a bottle will usually indicate a mature wine. The resulting wine, with this loss of tannins and pigment, will have a paler color and taste softer, less astringent. The sediment, while harmless, can have an unpleasant taste and is often separated from the wine by decanting.|$|E
25|$|The Chardonnay grape {{itself is}} very neutral, {{with many of}} the flavors {{commonly}} associated with the grape being derived from such influences as terroir and oak. It is vinified in many different styles, from the lean, crisply mineral wines of Chablis, France, to New World wines with oak, and tropical fruit flavors. In cool climates (such as Chablis and the Carneros AVA of California), Chardonnay tends to be medium to light body with noticeable acidity and flavors of green plum, apple, and pear. In warmer locations (such as the Adelaide Hills and Mornington Peninsula in Australia and Gisborne and Marlborough region of New Zealand), the flavors become more citrus, peach, and melon, while in very warm locations (such as the Central Coast AVA of California), more fig and tropical fruit notes such as banana and mango come out. Wines that have gone through malolactic fermentation tend to have softer acidity and fruit flavors with buttery <b>mouthfeel</b> and hazelnut notes.|$|E
25|$|The {{generally}} hot {{climate of}} the Barossa Valley usually means that the grapes become ripe very easily {{with high levels of}} sugars and low levels of acids. Winemaking in the Barossa Valley often utilizes the process of acidification in order to add balance to the wine. The high alcohol levels from the fermented sugars may be offset by various winemaking practices including reverse osmosis and adding water to the must. Historically, winemakers in the Barossa Valley have utilized very short maceration periods that limit {{the amount of time that}} the wines spends in contact with the skin. Often the wine is racked off the skins into oak wine barrels before fermentation is even completed. While this does mean that supplemental tannins might need to be added, this short maceration often leaves the wines with a smooth <b>mouthfeel.</b> The extensive use of oak is also a characteristic of Barossa Valley winemaking with American oak, with its more aggressive dill and coconut aroma notes, often used more than French oak.|$|E
25|$|After fermentation, the must is {{normally}} high in malic acid and producers {{will put the}} wine through malolactic fermentation to soften the wine. The process of chaptalization, adding sugar to the grape must to boost alcohol levels, has been a controversial issue for Beaujolais winemakers. Historically, Beaujolais producers would pick grapes at ripeness that were at minimum potential alcohol levels of 10-10.5% and then add sugar in order to artificially boost the alcohol levels to the near the maximum of 13-13.5%. This created wines lacking structure and balance {{to go with the}} high alcohol body and <b>mouthfeel.</b> The recent trend towards higher quality wine production has limited the use of chaptalization in the premium levels of Beaujolais wine. Filtering the wine in order to stabilize it is practiced to varying degrees by Beaujolais winemakers. Some producers who make Beaujolais on a large commercial scale will filter the wine aggressively to avoid any impurity or future chemical reactions. This can have the negative side effect of diminishing some of the wine's unique fruit character and leave a flavor that critics have described as Jell-O-like.|$|E
25|$|The Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine sub-appellation is {{the most}} {{productive}} and notable region of Muscadet, producing {{more than three-quarters of}} the region's entire production. (In contrast, the Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire AOC only produces around 20% of the amount of wine of Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine) In fact, more AOC Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine is produced on a yearly basis than in any other single AOC in the entire Loire Valley. The appellation is located east and south around the city of Nantes and is named after the rivers Sèvre and Maine that flow through it. Vineyard soil composition varies throughout the region and can range from the granite and schist hillsides around the village of Saint-Fiacre-sur-Maine to the predominantly clay based soils of Vallet. The most ideally situated vineyards are located around the villages of La Chapelle-Heulin, St-Fiacre, Vallet and Vertou Around 45% of the wine made Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine is aged sur lie. The wines made in this style tend to be slightly fuller body and can have some of the texture and <b>mouthfeel</b> of a white Bourgogne AOC. Well made examples will have a balance of fruit, acidity and texture.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{winemaking}} decisions where a producer's style {{can come}} through is {{the decision of}} whether or not to destem the grapes prior to crushing and fermentation. The presence of stems provide channels for the juice to percolate through the mass of grape skins that will form the cap during fermentation. This cap needs to be managed well and kept in constant contact with the juice in order to extract the color and phenolic compounds that will affect the flavor and aroma of the wine. While stems can help with this cap management, they also provide an additional source of tannins that may be extracted into the wine. The degree of tannin extraction desired will be up to the winemaker with some tannins adding to the <b>mouthfeel</b> and aging potential of the wine while too much can make the wine seem harsh, bitter and out of the balance. The length of maceration, whether or not the wine stays in contact with its skin throughout the entire fermentation period, as well as the temperature that the wine is kept at throughout that fermentation will have an influence on the extraction of the color, tannins and phenols. The temperature of fermentation will also affect the volatilizing of the compounds that contribute to the aroma of the wine.|$|E
500|$|Magnapop is an American {{rock band}} based in Atlanta, Georgia. Formed in 1989, the band has {{consistently}} included songwriting duo Linda Hopper as vocalist and Ruthie Morris on guitar. Magnapop first achieved {{recognition in the}} Benelux countries of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg through the festival circuit and have remained popular in Europe throughout their career. After modest success in the United States in the mid-1990s with the singles [...] "Slowly, Slowly" [...] and [...] "Open the Door" [...] {{and a series of}} albums produced by Michael Stipe, Bob Mould, and Geza X, the band went on an extended hiatus due to the dissolution of their record label. They returned with a new rhythm section in 2005 on the Daemon Records release <b>Mouthfeel.</b> The band has continued to perform and record since this reunion and have self-released two more albums. Magnapop's musical style is noted for blending the pop vocals and melodies of Hopper with the aggressive, punk-influenced guitar-playing of Morris and her back-up vocal harmonies.|$|E
2500|$|Ropiness is {{manifested}} as {{an increase in}} viscosity and a slimey or fatty <b>mouthfeel</b> of a wine. In France the fault is known as [...] "graisse", which translates to fat. The problem stems from the production of dextrins and polysaccharides by certain lactic acid bacteria, particularly of the genera Leuconostoc and Pediococcus.|$|E
2500|$|Although low to {{moderate}} air flow {{is important for}} producing a good-quality aged raw pu'er, it is generally agreed by most collectors and connoisseurs that raw pu'er tea cakes older than 30 years should not be further exposed to [...] "open" [...] air since it {{would result in the}} loss of flavors or degradation in <b>mouthfeel.</b> The tea should instead be preserved by wrapping or hermetically sealing it in plastic wrapping or ideally glass.|$|E
2500|$|... "Open the Door" [...] is a 1996 single by Magnapop {{released}} by Play It Again Sam Records as a CD maxi-single, two-track CD [...] and 7" [...] on red viny [...] A promotional CD and 10" [...] were {{released by}} Priority Records. Live {{recordings of the}} song appear on the German edition of 2005's <b>Mouthfeel</b> and the live album Magnapop Live at Maxwell's 03/09/2005. A music video was created for the song in 1996.|$|E
