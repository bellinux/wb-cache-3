500|$|Danny Antonucci, who {{has worked}} in {{animation}} since the 1970s, decided to create his first solo work. Tired of people thinking that animation was only for children, he wanted to create a [...] "character that people would believe in". Due to his Italian heritage, Antonucci wanted his character to be an Italian immigrant who would blame America for all of his problems. Originally named [...] "Lupo the Barber", Antonucci eventually settled on the name [...] "Lupo the Butcher". This character was inspired by his father and uncle. After the short was finalized, Antonucci was pleased with his creation, and felt that the three-and-a-half <b>minute</b> <b>movie</b> [...] "worked out". It was produced by Marv Newland's International Rocketship Limited. Released in 1987, it was shown at Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation. Antonucci went on to found a.k.a Cartoon, Inc., with which he would create The Brothers Grunt and Ed, Edd n Eddy.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{no limit}} on movie length. The average movie length is between 30 seconds and 3 minutes, but user created films {{can be as}} long as budget will allow (although a 10-minute film might require over 20 game years of filming). In sandbox mode however, a {{director}} can have the movie shoot automatically with the correct options turned on, allowing a 15–20 <b>minute</b> <b>movie</b> made in about a minute. If this is chosen, however, the movie's crew rating will be announced as [...] "awful". Once the actors, extras, director and crew are assigned to a film, production begins, with the entire staff of the film travelling between sets to film the movie. The sandbox mode allows films to be created without undergoing the lengthy production process, and with budgets of over $100 million. A film {{can be one of}} five genres: action, comedy, horror, romance or science fiction. The main effect genre choice has is that real world events affect popularity of different genres. (The Vietnam War decreases popularity of action, the Space Race increases the popularity of science fiction, World War II decreases the popularity of horror, the post-war period increases the popularity of horror, and the Great Depression increases the popularity of comedy.) ...|$|E
