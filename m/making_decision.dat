Blackford was reappointed again in 1833 by Governor Noah Noble and in 1840 by Samuel Bigger who were both of same party as Blackford. Democratic Governor Whitcomb at first refused to reappoint Blackford because of his age in 1847. He {{nominated}} four different replacements for Blackford but the Indiana Senate refused to confirm them, forcing Whitcomb to give in and reappoint Blackford. Whitcomb likewise had refused to reappoint the other two members of the court, leaving Blackford as the only justice on the court for nearly a year while the governor wrangled with the General Assembly over the issue. In both 1826 and 1847, Blackford was {{the only member of the}} court to be reappointed, based largely on his popularity and the fame of his reports. His fellow court members had been ejected because of their age, or their slow pace in <b>making</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the {{relationship}} between educational preparation, clinical experience, and the nurses’ self-perceived <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> characteristics. The characteristics analyzed were frequency of <b>making</b> <b>decisions,</b> difficulty in <b>making</b> <b>decisions,</b> influential factors in <b>decision</b> <b>making,</b> and process used in <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b> The retrospective correlational design used a convenience sample of 93 associate and baccalaureate degree nurses from hospitals within Midwestern United States. Informed consent for the study was assumed by the completion and return of the demographic data form and the two questionnaires: Clinical <b>Decision</b> <b>Making</b> in Nursing (Jenkins, 1985) and the <b>Decision</b> <b>Making</b> Questionnaire (Pardue, 1987). Confidentiality of the subjects was maintained through the use of coding. There were no foreseeable risks or discomforts. Eight hypotheses were developed and analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance and post-hoc univariate analysis. The results indicated no significant differences in frequency of <b>making</b> <b>decisions,</b> difficulty in <b>making</b> <b>decisions</b> or process used in <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> between baccalaureate and associate degree nurses. The only significant difference in influential factors was in the factor of “stress”. No significant differences existed for frequency, difficulty, or process used between experienced and inexperienced nurses. However, a significant difference was found in the influential factors of <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> between the two groups. The areas of difference were “experience” and “role-modeling”.

When the condition is fulfilled, a branch activates exactly {{only one of the}} outgoing control flows and deactivates the others. The counterpart of a branch is a merge. A merge may have two or more incoming flows and one outgoing control flow. A merge synchronizes an activated and the deactivated alternatives.
