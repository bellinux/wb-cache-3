40|$|Waste {{management}} in the leather industry worldwide {{is an issue of}} major importance for both solid and liquid wastes. It has been recognised that there are major environmental impacts from the poorly managed disposal of such wastes and these have a clear health impact upon human society. Within Europe, under EU driven legislation, the costs of wastes management are increasing rapidly and there is a clear need to research improved methods to cost effectively deal with leather industry wastes. Biodegradation (anaerobic), as a management option, of solid wastes from the leather industry is an area that is attracting increased interest in recent years as being a technique that has wide public acceptability as well as process efficiency. However, tanning agents that prolong the lifetime of leather goods {{have a negative impact on}} biodegradation and this needs to be addressed before efficient treatment can occur. To drive the agenda this research has the aims of • Highlighting the effects of tanning agent on anaerobic digestion. • Understanding the mechanism(s) by which different leather tannages can biodegraded. • Developing a process to reverse the action of tannage. Leather solid wastes were anaerobically digested using Serum Bottle Assays (SBA). The effect of a range of vegetable, <b>mineral</b> and aldehyde <b>tanning</b> agents of leather on the rate of anaerobic digestion was assessed. Common tanning agents used included; myrica, valonea, glutaraldehyde and chrome. To further identify key factors for cost effective anaerobic digestion, tanned hide powders and tanned leathers were also pre-treated using autoclaving, liming, enzymes etc, in an attempt to determine whether tannage may be reversed. Major techniques used in the research include: anaerobic digestion, Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP), Total Solids contents (TS), Gas Chromatography (GC) and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Hydrolysable tannins are less resistant to anaerobic digestion than condensed tannins. However, enzymatic pre-treatment reduces the resistance and this offers a new effective pre-treatment route. Thermal pre-treatment also decreased resistance to anaerobic digression especially for chrome, glutaraldehyde, myrica and tannic acid tanned leathers. Chemical pre-treatment also generally lowered the resistance to anaerobic digestion. Selective pre-treatment offers a means of improving the cost effectiveness of anaerobic digestion of leather and therefore enabling a new waste management method to be adopted by the industry. A relationship emerges, in some cases, between chemical structure of tanning agent and inhibition of anaerobic digestion. This offers the possibility of producing new, designed organic tanning agents with, suitable properties, to be adopted by the industiy, The research agenda within the leather industry is still ongoing and recommendations for future research are addressed...|$|R

40|$|Ecological {{pressures}} on chromium have now forced the leather industry {{to look for}} possible alternatives. A vegetable- aluminum combination tannage has been studied, with special attention being given to intended final product. Aluminum is <b>mineral</b> <b>tanning</b> agents that are widely used to stabilize collagens in the leather industry. In this study, the crosslinking of vegetable and aluminum, with collagens, have been explored. This kind of chrome free tannage give us leathers with shrinkage temperature around 125 oC, elongation at break 65. 6 %, tensile strength 38 N/mm 2, and tear strength 98 N/mm. The chemical properties of the combination tanned leathers {{are found to be}} quite normal. Among the combination system evaluated, a vegetable pretannage followed by retannage with basic aluminum sulphate was found to produce stronger leather with the durable characteristics. In contrast, pre-tanning with aluminum possibly tightens the collagen fiber network, preventing high molecular weight vegetable tannins from interacting with collagen fibres. Optimal results were obtained when 10 % (w/w) vegetable tannins (garad) and 2 % Aluminum sulphate was used...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{alternative}} <b>mineral</b> <b>tanning</b> agents investigated for replacing chromium, titanium (IV) -based salts {{are one of}} the most promising ones for the development of novel and cleaner tanning processes in the leather industry. The molecular mechanism of the solvation of titanyl salts and their interaction with masking agents was investigated in the present work. A computational study based on the quantum mechanical density functional theory was carried out, focusing on the behavior of complexes between titanyl oligomers of suitable length and different masking agents. The optimized structure of a titanyl octamer was calculated. Different carboxylic acids, and their corresponding anions, containing at least two polar functional groups suitable for the complexation of the titanyl, were considered as masking agents: glycolic, lactic, malic, citric, and phthalic acid. The most significant geometric and energetic parameters of the different titanyl-masking agent complexes were calculated. The results obtained indicate that the lactic acid system shows the best binding energies and the best flexibility. The OH–CRR’–COOH structure appears to be well fitted to complex the titanyl chain. The effect of the R and R’ sidechains on complex stabilization seems to be related to electrostatic factors (presence of charge) rather than to steric hindrance...|$|E
40|$|In today's move to "sustainable production" {{the leather}} industry, {{as well as}} many other {{industries}} is recognized as a polluting one. Traditional chemical operations are polluting because of the levels of inorganic chemical waste. Process chemicals which are not consumed within the reactions necessary to convert collagen to leather are currently discharged to waste. These are usually applied during bulk production, such as inorganic agents from beam house and tanning processes, e. g. lime, sulphide, ammonium salts, sulphuric acid and sodium chloride, <b>mineral</b> <b>tanning</b> agents – mainly Cr(III) and the less common Al(III), Zr(III), Ti(III), Fe(III) salts -, whereas depending on the tanning process and the leather article produced organic chemical waste discharged comprises aldehydic and polyphenolic tanning products, bating enzymes, organic carboxylic acids and excess electrolyte stable synthetic fat liquors. It is rare for chemicals and water to be recovered for re-use from several of these process steps. Moreover, tanners worldwide are required to operate within strict legislative boundaries. Serious drawbacks continuously arise concerning the chrome–tanning process in leather industry and the environmental hazardous consequences of chromium containing effluents. In order to overcome this impediment, a great deal of research has been focused on developing chrome–free tanning methods in the past years, such as titanium tanning. In the present study, Ti–Al tanned bovine leather was characterized by means of SEM microscopy, EDAX elemental analysis, ATR–FTIR spectroscopy, thermogravimetry TGA, and differential scanning calorimetry DSC techniques. ...|$|E
40|$|Leather is a {{high tech}} {{material}} with different application fields, such as automotive, manufacturing of leatherwear articles or clothing and footwear. Leather is a biomaterial obtained by processing animal skins. Unfortunately, raw animal hides are practically inutilizable, due to their microbiological instability and are affected by rotting. Microbiological stability is achieved by tanning, when the protein is crosslinked, followed by drying. After crosslinking and drying, the new material shows the required properties of sustainability, availability and an esthetically pleasing aspect to the touch, making it available across its entire range of applications. From a structural point of view the animal skins are constituted of collagen, which is a fibrilar protein {{with a high degree}} of supramolecular organization in triple helix form that endows softness, elasticity and mechanical strength. High quality standards and lack of toxicity are required in all cases. Leather colour changes during exposure to light radiations are considered a consequence of the presence of some products with weak photochemical resistance during fabrication. The study aims to compare changes in properties of leathers obtained using <b>mineral</b> <b>tanning</b> agents such as Cr III salts and those obtained with the more environment-friendly technology using acid hydrolysis. Accelerated aging studies were conducted on tanned leathers by exposing the samples to UV radiation with different irradiation doses and two wavelengths (254 and 365 nm) under controlled humidity and temperature conditions. Structural changes caused by irradiation were studied by FTIR. Colour changes on the sample surfaces were assessed during irradiation with the CIEL a*b* system.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia QuímicaAs preocupações ambientais associadas à indústria dos curtumes centram-se no curtume com crómio, uma das etapas mais poluentes de todo o processo. Actualmente, 80 a 90 % das peles, em todo o mundo, são curtidas com crómio (wet blue), é do interesse de todos a busca por um processo isento de crómio, de forma a obter um couro mais ecológico, o wet white. A pele é formada por uma rede complexa de fibras de colagénio que são estabilizadas através da formação de cross-links inter e intramoleculares, que lhe confere as propriedades físicas. Quando aquecidas em água essas fibras encolhem, devido ao processo de desnaturação, a temperatura à qual ocorre é designada por temperatura de encolhimento (Ts). O curtume vai criar ligações que conferem maior estabilidade às fibras elevando a sua Ts. Uma das vantagens do crómio como agente de curtume é a elevada estabilidade hidrotérmica que confere ao couro, obtendo Ts {{superior}} a 100 ºC. Foram desenvolvidos processos com diferentes agentes de curtume, de forma a encontrar alternativas ao crómio. Efectuaram-se ensaios de curtume mineral, com crómio, zircónio e silicatos; curtume vegetal, com extracto de mimosa, quebracho e genipina; curtume sintético, com tanino sintético, resina acrílica e gluteraldeído; e finalmente curtumes mistos, combinando processos dos curtumes anteriores. Foi avaliada a estabilidade hidrotérmica das peles processadas pelos métodos desenvolvidos pela determinação das Ts (norma ISO 3380 e banho termostatizado). Usou-se a calorimetria diferencial de varrimento (DSC), de forma a determinar a variação de entalpia associada à desnaturação do colagénio. Para um estudo mais detalhado foi realizada a análise dos espectros FTIR-ATR permitindo identificar alterações na estrutura da pele, quer na sequência do processo de curtume, quer após o encolhimento da pele. Os resultados obtidos que permitem propor processos alternativos ao crómio, com elevadas Ts e menos poluentes, um dos quais já com implementação na indústria. The {{environmental concerns}} {{generated by the}} tanning industry focuses on chrome tanning, {{one of the most}} polluting parts of the process. Currently, 80 to 90 % of the hides worldwide are tanned using chrome (wet-blue). The effort to produce chrome-free leather, a wet white, in order to obtain a more ecological leather is increasing. The fibrous structure of hide is formed by a complex matrix of collagen fibers that stabilizes through inter- and intra-molecular cross-links, which gives them physical properties. Shrinkage temperature (Ts), or denaturation, is one aspect of hydrothermal stability that is the response of leather to heat in the presence of water. Tanning process gives fiber higher stability which results on an increasing of the leather Ts. One of the advantages of chrome tanned leather is the high shrinkage temperature, typically above 100 ºC. Other tanning agents were used to develop new ways of finding alternative chromiumfree leather processes. <b>Mineral</b> <b>tanning</b> agents, as chromium, zirconium and silicates; vegetal tanning agents, as genipin, mimosa and quebracho; syntans, acrylic resin, gluteraldehyde and also different combinations of the previous agents were used. The hydrothermal stability of the leather samples was evaluated by measuring the Ts (through ISO 3380 and water bath) and by differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements, allowing the study of enthalpy changes, which are associated with the denaturation of collagen. For a more detailed study a FTIR-ATR spectra analysis were performed to verify changes in the hide structure, resulting from tanning processes as well as of denaturation process. The results of this work showed that other tanning agents, with lower environmental impact, can be effective at increasing the thermal stability of leather. One of the developed processes is already being implemented in the industry...|$|E
40|$|La {{migration}} et la spéciation de Cr, de Cu et de Pb sont étudiées sur le sol d'une colonne alimentée par les eaux usées de tanneries. La localisation des métaux est évaluée à l'aide du schéma d'extractions sélectives préconisé par Legret et al. (1988). Les résultats ont montré que l'horizon superficiel renferme des teneurs en métaux très élevées. Parmi les métaux étudiés, le Cr s'avère retenu essentiellement dans la phase résiduelle mais il se présente aussi sous des formes plus mobiles. Le Cu est principalement associé avec la phase résiduelle et organique. Le Pb est lié aux phases acido-soluble et réductible. De ce fait, l'épandage des eaux usées de tanneries, sans aucun traitement préalable, peut être une source de contamination des sols et des eaux souterraines, notamment pour le Cr. In Morocco, {{the town}} of Marrakesh, as {{in other areas of}} the country, is subject to multiple daily aggressions generated by industrial pollution, in particular from tanneries. The tannery waste water is discharged directly into the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems without any preliminary processing. In order to evaluate the danger that can be generated by tannery effluents in the receiving ecosystems, and to study the ecotoxicological and environmental impact resulting from that chemical treatment of these effluents, we determined, before and after treatment, the inhibitory effect of the two most polluted effluents originating from manufactured leather: liming-deliming and chromium tanning. The purpose of our investigation was thus to evaluate the acute toxicity of the chromium tanning and epilage-coat waste waters before and after chemical treatment. The invertebrate Daphnia pulex was used for the toxicity test and the toxicity due to these industrial waste waters was evaluated by regression analysis. The processing carried out on the chromium tanning waste water consisted of precipitation with sodium carbonate at different pH values. The treatment of liming-deliming wastewaters consisted of an elimination and recovery of the sulphide compounds without carrying out their degradation. The chromium level was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry with graphite furnace atomization. The results of the toxicity test showed that the investigated chromium tanning and liming-deliming effluents presented were toxic, with respective IC 50 - 24 h values of 0. 15 and 3. 36 (expressed as dilution ratios). This toxicity could be explained by high levels of chromium, sulphides and organic matter in these waste waters. It is however difficult to correlate the IC 50 values obtained with those of the physical-chemical parameters. The tested effluents are very complex matrices. On the other hand, we noticed a notable difference between these two effluents. The <b>mineral</b> <b>tanning</b> effluent is contaminated with chromium and organic matter, whereas the second is especially rich in organic matter and sulphide. The total chromium concentration corresponding to the IC 50 - 24 h value of the raw chromium tanning effluent is lower than that which would be expected on the basis on the known toxicity of K 2 Cr 2 O 7, showing the toxicity of raw chromium waste waters is due not only to chromium, but also to other chemicals used during the manufacturing process of leather. After processing by chemical precipitation, the IC 50 - 24 h values increased from 0. 15 to 26. 6 and from 3. 36 to 11. 1 respectively, for the chromium tanning and the epilage-coat effluents. Consequently, these treated sewages can be classified as low toxicity wastes. The comparison of the results is very difficult considering that the test conditions and the physicochemical and heavy metal characteristics of the effluents vary enormously over time, without forgetting the physicochemical composition of the experimental solution used by standard OECD (fresh water) and the standard ISO (synthetic water). From where necessity to vary tests for determining well the degree of an effluent toxicity which the effects appear differently at various levels trophic. The diminution observed in the toxicity of the effluents is linked to a reduction of suspended matter (95 %), COD (55 %), Cr (90 %) and sulphides (50 %). Hence, this treatment presents at least two advantages. The first is environmental as just mentioned. The second is economic since chromium can be recycled for reuse in leather tanning. The results suggest that the recovered chromium is similar to commercial tanning chromium. These results also show that the fixing of chromium does not depend on the nature of the treated skin. In fact, a technical and economic analysis showed that proposed treatment can be economically beneficial (3112, 5 $ per 1000 tons of skins) ...|$|E
