5000|$|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints {{teaches that}} no one should arouse sexual {{feelings}} outside of marriage, including those towards members of the same sex. The LDS church recognizes that feelings of same-sex attraction may not change or be overcome in this earth life, and expect all un-married members, gay or straight, to abstain from any and all sexual relations outside of heterosexual marriage. The LDS church maintains that feelings and inclinations toward the same sex (i.e., homosexual feelings or [...] "temptations") are not inherently sinful, but engaging in homosexual behavior is in conflict with the [...] "doctrinal principle, based on sacred scripture … that marriage {{between a man and a}} woman is essential to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children." [...] Those who experience same-sex attraction should continually exercise self-control and reliance on the atonement of Jesus Christ in order to refrain from acting on such feelings. The LDS church strongly opposes same-sex marriage and teaches that marriage is only to be between a man and a woman, and that this is essential to God's eternal plan.
