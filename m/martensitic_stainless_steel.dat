5|$|Elwood Haynes (October 14, 1857– April 13, 1925) was an American inventor, metallurgist, {{automotive}} pioneer, entrepreneur and industrialist. He {{invented the}} metal alloys stellite and <b>martensitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and designed {{one of the}} earliest automobiles made in the United States. He is recognized for having created the earliest American design that was feasible for mass production and, with the Apperson brothers, he formed the first company in the United States to produce automobiles profitably. He made many advances in the automotive industry.|$|E
5|$|He {{applied for}} another patent on an alloy he called {{stainless}} steel, {{now known as}} <b>martensitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel.</b> The Patent Office rejected his application {{saying that it was}} not a new alloy. Haynes conceded their point, but submitted a second application and supplied a sample showing the stainlessness of his alloy when created using his exact proportions of metals, and it was granted. At the urging of his wife, he created the first set of stainless steel silverware for her personal use. The first piece of stainless steel was forged by Homer Dan Farmer in Haynes laboratory. It was a large meat knife and was donated to the Haynes Museum by the family of Dan Heflin, grandson of Homer Dan Farmer. In later years he claimed to have created stainless steel because she did not enjoy polishing their silver tableware. British metallurgist Harry Brearley independently produced an identical alloy around the same time and applied for an American patent and found that one already existed. Brearley had also created other innovations for the metal, but they were of little value without the stainless steel patent. He sought out Haynes and the two decided to pool their findings in a single company to produce the alloy. Haynes sold his stainless steel patent in 1918 to the American Stainless Steel Company, a company Brearley had created with the assistance of investors in Pennsylvania. In exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until the patent expired in 1930. The stock he received as payment allowed him to gain a seat among the company's board of directors and he installed his son, March, to represent him. The income from the transaction led Haynes to begin the accumulation of a large fortune.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{research}} {{consisted of}} implementing and evaluating an empirical mathematical model to reproduce analytically the dilatometric behavior of ASTM 420 A and ASTM 440 C <b>martensitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> widely used for manufacturing surgical tools. <b>Martensitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> can be subdivided into three subgroups: low-carbon, medium-carbon and high-carbon steels. The microstructure {{of each group}} is also characteristic as needlelike martensitic; very fine martensitic; and ultra-fine martensitic containing carbides. The proposed method was based on experimental data obtained from the dilatometric testing of the steel samples applying low heating rates. It was possible to determine the formation of phase fields near the equilibrium conditions.

After a hardening process at 1040 °C and annealing at 160 °C the blades achieve an average hardness of 56 HRC.

40|$|The Task No. 1, (Part-II) of the {{recently}} concluded project “The effect of changing from MSF to RO water on the internal corrosion of Line-C (Line 3) ” was concerned with the Slow Strain Rate Testing (SSRT).

P., there is a possibility of hydrogen embrittlement of the material due to hydrogen ingress. Owing to nonavailability of SSRT during the execution of Line-C project, this task could not be carried out and was initiated only when the SSRT machine (manufactured by M/s Cortest, U. K.) was acquired by R&D Center. In SSRT, a tensile specimen is subjected to a steadily increasing stress in a given environment. This procedure results in rupture of surface films and thus tends to eliminate initiation time required for surface crack to form. The test is continued till the specimen fails, the ductility and strength parameters coupled with surface morphology of the fracture provide information about the mode of failure. <b>Martensitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> 410, 420 and 431 in environments of air or sal...|$|R

50|$|<b>Stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> {{because of}} their high {{chromium}} content, tend to behave differently with respect to weldability than other steels. Austenitic grades of <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> {{tend to be the}} most weldable, but they are especially susceptible to distortion due to their high coefficient of thermal expansion. Some alloys of this type are prone to cracking and reduced corrosion resistance as well. Hot cracking is possible if the amount of ferrite in the weld is not controlled - to alleviate the problem, an electrode is used that deposits a weld metal containing a small amount of ferrite. Other types of <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> such as ferritic and <b>martensitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> are not as easily welded, and must often be preheated and welded with special electrodes.|$|R

50|$|Common {{among all}} of the {{different}} specifications and types are the following steps: Prior to passivation, the object must be cleaned of any contaminants and generally must undergo a validating test {{to prove that the}} surface is 'clean.' The object is then placed in an acidic passivating bath that meets the temperature and chemical requirements of the method and type specified between customer and vendor. (Temperatures can range from ambient to 60 degrees C {140 degrees F}), while minimum passivation times are usually 20 to 30 minutes). The parts are neutralized using a bath of aqueous sodium hydroxide, then rinsed with clean water and dried. The passive surface is validated using humidity, elevated temperature, a rusting agent (salt spray), or some combination of the three. However, proprietary passivation processes exist for <b>martensitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> which is difficult to passivate, as microscopic discontinuities can form in the surface of a machined part during passivation in a typical nitric acid bath. The passivation process removes exogenous iron, creates/restores a passive oxide layer that prevents further oxidation (rust), and cleans the parts of dirt, scale, or other welding-generated compounds (e.g. oxides).|$|E

50|$|Given {{that the}} turbine blades {{in a water}} turbine are {{constantly}} exposed to water and dynamic forces, {{they need to have}} high corrosion resistance and strength. The most common material used in overlays on carbon steel runners in water turbines are austenitic steel alloys that have 17% to 20% chromium to increase stability of the film which improves aqueous corrosion resistance. The chromium content in these steel alloys exceed the minimum of 12% chromium required to exhibit some atmospheric corrosion resistance. Having a higher chromium concentration in the steel alloys allows for a much longer lifespan of the turbine blades. Currently, the blades are made of martensitic stainless steels which have high strength compared to austenitic stainless steels by a factor of 2. Besides corrosion resistance and strength as the criteria for material selection, weld-ability and density of the turbine blade. Greater weld-ability allows for easier repair of the turbine blades. This also allows for higher weld quality which results in a better repair. Selecting a material with low density is important to achieve higher efficiency because the lighter blades rotate more easily. The most common material used in Kaplan Turbine blades are stainless steel alloys (SS). The different alloys used are SS(16Cr-5Ni), SS(13Cr-4Ni), SS(13Cr-1Ni). The <b>martensitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> alloys have high strength, thinner sections than standard carbon steel, and reduced mass that enhances the hydrodynamic flow conditions and efficiency of the water turbine. The SS(13Cr-4Ni) has been shown to have improved erosion resistance at all angles of attack through the process of laser hardening. It is important to minimize erosion in order to maintain high efficiencies because erosion negatively impacts the hydraulic profile of the blades which reduces the relative ease to rotate.|$|E
