5000|$|Q: <b>Multiplier-Quotient</b> <b>Register</b> (18 bit), stores {{the last}} {{significant}} half of result after multiplication and division. It can be also used as extension of Accumulator ...|$|E
5000|$|Arithmetic unit II {{performed}} both arithmetic {{and addressing}} operations. It had four registers. P was the program counter, R and E were special-purpose, and Q, {{which was used}} for 32-bit operations (with A as the high-order word), or 48-bit operations (with A and B). Q also served as the <b>multiplier-quotient</b> <b>register</b> for multiplication and division.|$|E
50|$|The PDP-6 was infamous {{because of}} the 6205 board, a large (11 Ã— 9 inches) board which {{contained}} 1 bit of arithmetic register (AR), memory buffer (MB), and <b>multiplier-quotient</b> <b>register</b> (MQ) (thus there were 36 of these). It had 88 transistors, a two-sided PC etch, two 18-pin and two 22-pin connectors (two {{on each side of}} the module). Because of all these connectors, swapping this module was a major undertaking, and the mechanical coupling made it highly likely that fixing one fault would cause another. There was also a great fear of powering off a PDP-6, since it would generally result in at least one 6205 board failing.The experience with the 6205 led the designers of the first models of PDP-10, the KA10 and KI10, to use only small boards. It was not until the KL10 that large boards were used again.|$|E
