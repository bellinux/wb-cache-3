25|$|Fossil {{teeth and}} a partial jaw from hominins {{assumed to be}} ancestral to H. floresiensis were {{discovered}} in 2014 and described in 2016.

25|$|Another {{influential}} {{example of}} top-down control emerged from Jane Lubchenco’s experiments on New England rocky shores, which {{demonstrated that the}} herbivorous snail L. littorea exerts control on the diversity and succession of tide pool algal communities (Lubchenco and <b>Menge</b> 1978). One hypothesis that arose from Lubchenco’s work (Little and Kitching 1996) was that predation by the green crab (Carcinus maenas) influences rocky shore algal communities by regulating L. littorea abundances.|$|E

Even after a crossover with three soaps, Freunde fürs Leben, Forsthaus Falkenau and Unser Lehrer Doktor Specht, the soap was canceled after 313 episodes. Sat.1 tried {{to get into the}} soap business as well, after successfully airing the Australian soap opera Neighbours, which was dropped in 1995 due to the talk show phenomenon that took over most of the daytime schedules of German networks. The network first tried to tell a family saga with So ist das Leben – die Wagenfelds, before failing with Geliebte Schwestern. RTL II made its own short-lived attempt with Alle zusammen - jeder für sich.|$|E
500|$|Cunningham {{claimed a}} third victory on 15 February 1941. The Luftwaffe carried out air attacks on Liverpool and Humberside. Over Newton Abbot, Devon, he engaged a He 111 from Kampfgeschwader 27 (KG 27). It crashed outside Totnes. The bomber, 1G+FR, {{belonging}} to 7./KG 27 was completely destroyed. Leutnant Eberhard Beckmann {{and his crew}} were killed. The fifth victory eluded Cunningham for some time. On 12 March he was twice vectored onto enemy aircraft by Rawnsley. He could only claim a Ju 88 and He 111 damaged. On {{the night of the}} 3 April 1941 he accounted for his fourth enemy aircraft. Although claimed as a He 111, the identity of the aircraft was likely the Ju 88A-5, Werknummer ("factory number") 4224, code V4+AR of 7./KG 1 on a mission to raid Avonmouth. Leutnant Ernst <b>Menge</b> and his crew; [...] Wilhelm Hahn, Robert König, and Wilhelm Schreiber posted missing in action. On the night of the 7 April he became a fighter ace. A He 111 of 9./KG 26 was intercepted as its bombers attacked Portsmouth and Portland Harbour. Leutnant Erwin Hartmann crashed into the Channel with his crew. A No. 87 Squadron RAF pilot, Flight Lieutenant Derek Harland Ward claimed the victory as he saw a glow which he fired at before it hit the sea. However, Cunningham was credited with the victory as the Heinkel was about to crash. The 87 Squadron war diary acknowledged the fact in its entry for that night.|$|E

2500|$|In 1844, Heine wrote {{series of}} musical feuilletons over several {{different}} music seasons discussing {{the music of}} the day. His review of the musical season of 1844, written in Paris on April 25, 1844, is his first reference to Lisztomania, the intense fan frenzy directed toward Franz Liszt during his performances. However, Heine was not always honorable in his musical criticism. In April 1844 he wrote to Liszt suggesting that he might like to look at a newspaper review he had written of Liszt's performance before his concert; he indicated that it contained comments Liszt would not like. Liszt took this as an attempt to extort money for a positive review and did not meet Heine. Heine's review subsequently appeared on April 25 in Musikalische Berichte aus Paris and attributed Liszt's success to lavish expenditures on bouquets and to the wild behaviour of his hysterical female [...] "fans." [...] Liszt then broke relations with Heine. Liszt was not the only musician to be blackmailed by Heine for the nonpayment of [...] "appreciation money." [...] Meyerbeer had both lent and given money to Heine, but after refusing to hand over a further 500 francs was repaid by being dubbed [...] "a music corrupter" [...] in Heine's poem Die <b>Menge</b> tut es.|$|E

50|$|Hominin fossils at Mata <b>Menge,</b> in {{particular}} the mandible, are smaller than those of Homo floresiensis.

30|$|The {{majority}} of herbaceous species in rosemary scrub are gap specialists, and are most abundant, {{have the greatest}} survival, and highest seed production {{in the years immediately}} following fire (Hawkes and <b>Menges</b> 1996, <b>Menges</b> and Kimmich 1996, <b>Menges</b> 1999). As time-since-fire increases, gaps close while shrub, litter, and lichen covers increase and herbaceous species are outcompeted (<b>Menges</b> and Hawkes 1998). Gap sizes are smallest in long-unburned areas and largest between six and ten years post-fire; herb cover increases with gap area (<b>Menges</b> et al. 2008). <b>Menges</b> et al. (2008) found that sites greater than ten years post-fire have a wide amount of variation in gap area. Site-to-site variation in microhabitat cover may help to explain variation in seed density among different time-since-fire age classes (Navarra, University of Central Florida, unpublished data). Environmental variables such as elevation may explain why some sites retain greater amounts of open space than others (Hawkes and <b>Menges</b> 1996) and thus sustain higher cover of herbs, leading to larger yearly inputs into the seed bank. Increased variability of gap area as time-since-fire increases and dominance of the seed banks by scrub herbs may explain why, at the community level, only recently burned sites showed distinctive patterns of seed density, while sites ranging from six years post-fire to long-un-burned exhibited considerable overlap.|$|R
