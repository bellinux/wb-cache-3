5|$|The Sicilian apothecaries' ounce {{was divided}} in 10drachms. Since the scruple was divided in only 20grains, {{like in the}} {{northern}} countries, an ounce consisted of 600grains. This was not too different from the situation in <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> mediterranean countries, where an ounce consisted of 576grains.|$|E

25|$|Work on {{the cross}} started in 1292, later than <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> A great part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work was done by one Ralph de Chichester. No part survives. The precise {{location}} is unknown.|$|R
50|$|By 2013 a {{total of}} 27 dialogues with the Dalai Lama had been hosted, eleven books had been {{published}} relating the first thirteen dialogues to the public (see publications) and DVDs or videos published on <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|R
5|$|Unlike <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> German half-tracks, the Sd.Kfz. 8 {{was almost}} always used as a tractor for heavy {{artillery}} pieces and was not modified for other roles.|$|E
5|$|Unlike <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> major antisemitic films {{produced}} during the Third Reich, {{it was a}} great box-office success in Germany and abroad. It ranked sixth out of the thirty most popular German films of the war years.|$|E
5|$|A yoga {{system that}} predated the Buddhist school is Jain yoga. But since Jain sources postdate Buddhist ones, it is {{difficult}} to distinguish between the nature of the early Jain school and elements derived from other schools. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> contemporary yoga systems alluded in the Upanishads and some Pali canons are lost to time.|$|E
50|$|Evacuation was {{hampered}} by <b>the</b> overcrowding <b>of</b> lifeboats and <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> several boats to fire. Some passengers {{were able to}} reach the water via the gangways and rope ladders. Two ships alerted by distress signals managed to save <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|R
50|$|IGN's Craig Harris {{noted that}} the game was better than <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> in <b>the</b> Army Men series, and was {{impressed}} with the map size. However, he pointed out that the password system implemented in the game was ungainly and could only be used in-between the large levels.|$|R
50|$|In 1907 the Marine Department {{acquired}} an 805-ton gun boat and converted her to New Zealand's first training ship NZS Amokura. Over the next 14 years, 527 boys trained in her, 25 of them {{going on to}} naval service and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> into <b>the</b> merchant marine.|$|R
5|$|After the Ottoman defeat, {{the fleet}} was laid {{up at the}} Golden Horn and left largely {{unattended}} for the following twenty years. During this period of inactivity, Mesudiye received a minor modernization at the Tersâne-i Âmire shipyard on the Golden Horn. At {{the start of the}} Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Mesudiye was found to be unfit for combat, as were <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> major warships of the fleet. On 15 May Mesudiye and several other warships attempted to hold a training exercise, which only highlighted the poor state of training of the ships' crews.|$|E
5|$|After {{their first}} {{victory of the}} season, the Flyers were {{challenged}} by the Muncie Offers More AC. The game was labelled as the Muncie City Championship. Since <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> local teams' seasons were finished, both Muncie teams hired as many as 20 players for the game. The field was muddy, which caused Offers More AC to fumble the ball several times. In the third quarter, the Flyers scored two touchdowns {{to give them a}} 14–0 lead going into the fourth quarter. The Flyers added 10 more points—a touchdown and a field goal—in the final quarter to win the Championship 24–0.|$|E
5|$|Among more {{negative}} reviews include Jason Hughes of TV Squad, who commented that several jokes in the episode did not work, {{such as the}} reveal that Krusty the Clown has been sleeping with Sideshow Mel's wife for several years, though he did enjoy <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> jokes and applauded the development of Nelson's character.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> {{population}} <b>of</b> Lhasa prefectural-level city {{is about}} 500,000, of whom about 80% are ethnic Tibetan and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> are ethnic Han Chinese.

25|$|A {{timetable}} of 1874 {{showed some}} 9 departures daily from the Junction, {{although there was}} only one through train daily along <b>the</b> whole length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line, a journey of some 5½ hours. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> terminated at Hopton, but clearly all these workings passed through this Cromford wharf site.|$|R
500|$|T1 – This variant {{used two}} M2 Browning heavy machine guns on a Bendix mount on a 4×4 truck. This model, like <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> was a prototype.

5|$|As a {{founding}} member of the Association Française pour l'Avancement des Sciences, Lemoine presented what became his best-known paper, Note sur les propriétés du centre des médianes antiparallèles dans un triangle at the Association's 1874 meeting in Lille. The central focus of this paper concerned the point which bears his name today. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> results discussed in the paper pertained to various concyclic points that could be constructed from the Lemoine point.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{production}} difficulty and high price, lutetium has very few commercial uses, especially {{since it is}} rarer than <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> lanthanides but is chemically not very different. However, stable lutetium {{can be used as}} catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation, hydrogenation, and polymerization applications.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 7th centuryBC, the Iron-Age Etruscan civilization (Latin: Etrusci) was dominant in the region. Like <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> peoples in the region, the Romans warred against the Etruscans. By the close of the century, the Romans had lost their struggle for independence, and the Etruscans had conquered Rome, establishing a military dictatorship, or kingdom, in the city.|$|E

50|$|Following the elections, the NPO {{merged into}} the People's Party. However, in the {{build-up}} to the 1932 elections the party began to disintegrate over <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> separation from India; members in favour (largely former Nationalist Party members) left {{to join the}} Separation League whilst <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> joined <b>the</b> Anti-Separation League.|$|R
50|$|In 1907 the Marine Department {{acquired}} the 805 ton Royal Navy gun boat HMS Sparrow. This was {{converted into a}} training ship and renamed NZS Amokura.

5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} charged 33 JNA officersincluding Brčić who {{was tried}} in absentia and convicted to 15 years in prisonfor the bombardment of Split, Šolta and Brač. Brčić, {{who later became}} a high-ranking officer of the Montenegrin Navy, was arrested in Naples in late 2007 when he travelled to a NATO function. He was not extradited to Croatia. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> charged officers were also tried in absentia. , fifteen officersincluding Brčićwere convicted, one was acquitted and seventeen cases were ordered by the Supreme Court of Croatia to be retried because of irregularities during previous trials.|$|E
5|$|During {{the times}} of Vasabha, Mahasena (274–301) and Dhatusena, the {{construction}} of large irrigation tanks and canals was given priority. Vasabha constructed 11 tanks and 12 canals, Mahasen constructed 16 tanks and a large canal, and Dhatusena built 18 tanks. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> kings have also built irrigation tanks throughout Rajarata, the area around Anuradhapura. By {{the end of the}} Anuradhapura Kingdom, a large and intricate irrigation network was available throughout Rajarata to support the agriculture of the country.|$|E
5|$|It {{was freed}} of Kotte control in 1467; its {{subsequent}} rulers directed their energies towards consolidating its economic potential by maximising revenue from pearls and elephant exports and land revenue. It was less feudal than <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> regional kingdoms {{on the island}} of Sri Lanka of the same period. During this period, important local Tamil literature was produced and Hindu temples were built including an academy for language advancement.|$|E
50|$|All seven <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men {{charged with}} treason and <b>the</b> murder <b>of</b> Archduke Franz Ferdinand were convicted. Under Austro-Hungarian law, capital {{punishment}} {{could not be}} imposed on someone who was under <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 20 when they had committed the crime. Grabež and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> therefore received <b>the</b> maximum penalty <b>of</b> twenty years in prison.|$|R

50|$|Guillaume de Machaut wrote 42 ballades set to music. A {{few of them}} set two or {{even three}} poems to music simultaneously, with {{different}} texts sung in different voices. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> have a single texted voice with either one or two untexted (instrumental) accompanying voices. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> notable writers <b>of</b> ballades in <b>the</b> 15th century was François Villon.|$|R
5|$|Mercury is used {{primarily}} for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications. It is used in some thermometers, especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures. A still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in fluorescent lamps, while <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive Galinstan alloy.|$|E
5|$|Molluscs' circulatory {{systems are}} mainly open. Although {{molluscs}} are coelomates, their coeloms {{are reduced to}} fairly small spaces enclosing the heart and gonads. The main body cavity is a hemocoel through which blood and coelomic fluid circulate and which encloses <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> internal organs. These hemocoelic spaces act as an efficient hydrostatic skeleton. The blood contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin as an oxygen-carrier. The heart consists {{of one or more}} pairs of atria (auricles), which receive oxygenated blood from the gills and pump it to the ventricle, which pumps it into the aorta (main artery), which is fairly short and opens into the hemocoel.|$|E
5|$|Once the VIII Corps was at Koblenz, Patton took {{most of its}} {{divisions}} {{away for}} an operation with XII Corps further up the river at Mainz, leaving Middleton with some corps units (mostly artillery) and a single division, the 87th Infantry. Middleton asked Patton if he could take Koblenz with the 87th, eliciting a laugh from the army commander. Middleton pressed him to let him try, and with the commander's approval {{he was able to}} take the city, which only had about 500 defenders. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> German troops were {{on the other side of}} the Rhine not wanting to get trapped between the Rhine and the Moselle Rivers.|$|E
50|$|Also {{development}} {{problems with}} the B-29 meant that only 16 of them were really airworthy. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> were in AAF modification centers, located near the Bell-Marietta and Martin-Omaha plants and at air bases in Kansas, undergoing a series of modifications and changes necessitated by <b>the</b> lessons <b>of</b> air combat over Europe. Also, engine fires were still plaguing the B-29 program.|$|R
50|$|Greenall {{was one of}} a host {{of young}} players brought to Blackpool by Alan Ball during his short {{managerial}} reign at <b>the</b> club. Unlike <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> however, he remained at the club for years and developed into a dependable defender. He eventually took over the central role, combining with captain Steve Hetzke and Mike Conroy to form a successful defensive partnership.|$|R
