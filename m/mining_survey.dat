40|$|In {{response}} to the request to research government rules and regulations that are relative to <b>Mine</b> <b>Survey</b> and could impact on global mining companies in different countries in Africa, a framework has been established to assist and support many companies working in these countries. The framework guides investigations in determining the legal risks to the Company in general and <b>Mine</b> <b>Surveying</b> in particular. Legally appointed personnel fall directly under this risk profile. Furthermore, the primary activities and overlying acts and regulations form workable matrices to address all areas of compliance and risk within the <b>Mine</b> <b>Surveying</b> areas of responsibility. The framework {{takes into account the}} supporting activities which operate within the acts and regulations. These departments are generally not directly accountable to the legislation, but form part of the mining value chain and depend on <b>Mine</b> <b>Surveying</b> results and service. It is therefore appropriate that the investigation into the international component of the framework was conducted as well. The links to international codes and practices were established with special reference to <b>Mine</b> <b>Surveying</b> association and participation. The mining process was researched in its entirety. It was found that there are numerous government departments and associated laws prescribing compliance for Mine Surveyors. The framework describes the various levels of work so that all risk to people, property and equipment is tabled and applicable working standards and guidelines are put in place to mitigate such risk. A uniform standard can guide all Mine Surveyors in establishing the Survey Manual. This manual of standards drives levels of accuracy and therefore training and development of the individual Mine Surveyor. The major finding was that <b>Mine</b> <b>Survey</b> cannot be researched alone as it interfaces with several other mining departments, legal structures and possible international codes. This research has reported on the Ghanaian portion of a global mining company. The Company’s business units in other countries have been benchmarked as well. South African based mining companies have strong <b>Mine</b> <b>Survey</b> structures, while in countries such as Canada and Australia, <b>Mine</b> <b>Surveying</b> is a sub section of Engineering.

50|$|Half of the {{participants}} in a BNAmerica’s <b>mining</b> <b>survey</b> believe that political and legal uncertainty will slow mining investment in Latin America in 2017.

Some companies are looking towards consolidation, automation, and owner-operated mines to lessen the impacts of rising costs.|$|E

From the spectrum and photometry, we estimate a WD mass of 0. 92 (+ 0. 28,- 0. 32) Msun. Together with the orbital parameters of the binary, this implies that the unseen companion must be more massive than 1. 62 (+ 0. 20,- 0. 25) Msun, and is in all likelihood either a neutron star or a black hole.
