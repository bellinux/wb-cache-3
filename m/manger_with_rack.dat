40|$|Adenosine {{protects the}} heart from {{adrenergic}} overstimulation. This adenoprotection includes the direct anti-adrenergic action via adenosine A 1 receptors (A 1 R) on the adrenergic signaling pathway. An indirect A 1 R-induced attenuation of adrenergic responsiveness involves the translocation of PKC-ɛ to t-tubules and Z-line of cardiomyocytes. We investigated with sarcomere imaging, immunocytochemistry imaging, and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) whether A 1 R activation of PKC-ɛ induces the kinase translocation to receptor for activated C kinase 2 (RACK 2) in isolated rat and mouse hearts and whether phospholipase C (PLC) is involved. Rat cardiomyocytes {{were treated with}} the A 1 R agonist chlorocyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) and exposed to primary PKC-ɛ and <b>RACK</b> 2 antibodies <b>with</b> secondaries conjugated to Cy 3 and Cy 5 (indodicarbocyanine), respectively. Scanning confocal microscopy showed that CCPA caused PKC-ɛ to reversibly colocalize <b>with</b> <b>RACK</b> 2 within 3 min. Additionally, rat and mouse hearts were perfused and stimulated with CCPA or phenylisopropyladenosine to activate A 1 R, or with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate to activate PKC. RACK 2 was immunoprecipitated from heart extracts and resolved with SDS-PAGE. Western blotting showed that CCPA, phenylisopropyladenosine, and phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate in the rat heart increased the PKC-ɛ co-IP <b>with</b> <b>RACK</b> 2 by 186, 49, and > 1, 000 %, respectively. The A 1 R antagonist 8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 -dipropylxanthine prevented the CCPA-induced co-IP <b>with</b> <b>RACK</b> 2. In mouse hearts, CCPA increased the co-IP of PKC-ɛ <b>with</b> <b>RACK</b> 2 by 61 %. With rat cardiomyocytes, the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol increased sarcomere shortening by 177 %. CCPA reduced this response by 47 %, an action inhibited by the PLC inhibitor U- 73122 and 8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 -dipropylxanthine. In conclusion, A 1 R stimulation of the heart is associated with PLC-initiated PKC-ɛ translocation and association <b>with</b> <b>RACK</b> 2...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this study, the {{evolutionarily}} conserved intracellular adaptor protein, receptor of activated C kinase 1 (RACK 1) {{was identified}} as a novel interaction partner of protein inhibitor of activated STAT 2 (PIAS 2) using a yeast two-hybrid screening system. The direct interaction and co-localization of <b>RACK</b> 1 <b>with</b> PIAS 2 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining analysis, respectively. The 5 th to 7 th Trp-Asp 40 (5 – 7 WD 40) repeats of RACK 1 were identified as the minimal domain required for interaction with PIAS 2 by deletion analysis. Furthermore, multiple PIAS 2 -domains, particularly the ‘PINIT’ and RLD domains, bind the RACK 1 5 – 7 WD 40 domain.
