5000|$|Consumer advocate, Ralph Nader, {{issued a}} series of attacks on vehicle safety issues from GM - {{particularly}} the Chevrolet Corvair - in his book Unsafe at Any Speed, written in 1965. Being the first major action taken by Nader, he soon established {{his reputation as a}} crusader for safety. GM was then accused of sending spies after him. [...] "A woman at the supermarket confronted me and said, 'How {{would you like to have}} a talk on foreign affairs?' This wasn't a classroom, this was a supermarket, I was buying cookies - I don't think she wanted to talk about foreign affairs, I think she wanted to talk about domestic affairs", Nader said in the 2006 documentary An Unreasonable Man. Agents were supposedly trying to fix his mind and get him to engage in sexual activity. [...] "Mother would get calls saying, 'We've got a package for <b>Mr.</b> Ralph <b>Nader</b> at 9 AM.' There would also be threats like, 'You better back off, buddy boy'", said Claire, Nader's sister. GM was put on trial for attempting manipulation with Nader, Robert Kennedy and numerous other notable figures present at the trial. In the end, the CEO apologized to Nader; however, Nader continued to work against General Motors.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Ralph Nader's role in the 2000 presidential election, Public Citizen disassociated itself from its founder.Progressive magazine Mother Jones wrote about the so-called [...] "rank-and-file liberals”,who faulted Nader’s U.S. presidential run in 2000 for taking votes away from Al Gore, thus ensuring George Bush’s victory. Mother Jones {{also pointed out that}} Nader’s association with Public Citizen was causing fundraising problems. Mother Jones cited a letter by Public Citizen to its readership with the disclaimer: [...] "Although Ralph Nader was our founder, he has not held an official position in the organization since 1980 and does not serve on the board. Public Citizen—and the other groups that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Nader</b> founded—act independently." ...|$|E

Watt." [...] Wrote Pope {{in a letter to}} the New York Times dated November 1, 2000:Our membership did rise, but <b>Mr.</b> <b>Nader</b> ignores the harmful consequences of the Reagan-Watt tenure. Logging in national forests doubled. Acid rain fell unchecked. Cities were choked with smog. Oil drilling, mining and grazing increased on public lands. A Bush administration promises more drilling and logging, and less oversight of polluters. It would be little solace if our membership grew while our health suffered and our natural resources were plundered.|$|E
