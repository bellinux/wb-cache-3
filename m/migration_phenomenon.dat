50|$|The {{national}} {{net migration}} rate in Mexico is negative, estimated at -4.32 migrant per 1,000 population. The {{great majority of}} Mexican emigrants have moved to the United States of America. This <b>migration</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is not new, {{but it has been}} a defining feature in the relationship of both countries for most of the twentieth century. Since World Wars I and II, the United States government approved the recruitment of Mexican workers in their territory, and tolerated unauthorized migration to obtain additional farm and industrial workers to fill the necessary spots vacated by the population in war, and to supply the increase in the demand for labor. Nonetheless, the United States unilaterally ended the program as a result of activities of civil rights groups. In spite of that, emigration of Mexicans continued {{throughout the rest of the}} century at varying degrees. It grew significantly during the 1990s and has continued to do so in the first years of the 2000s. In fact, it has been estimated that 37% of all Mexican immigrants to the United States in the 20th century arrived during the 1990s. In 2000 approximately 20 million American residents identified themselves as either Mexican, Mexican-Americans or of Mexican origin, making it the sixth most cited ancestry of all US residents.|$|E

5000|$|Around 70% of all British Pakistanis {{trace their}} origins {{to the region}} of Mirpur in Azad Kashmir, northeastern Pakistan; {{including}} the towns of Dadyal, Chakswari, Islamgarh, Khari Sharif and surrounding villages. Some also originate from the neighbouring districts of Bagh, Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Neelum, Bhimber and Kotli. Mirpuri and Potohari, spoken natively by Mirpuri immigrants, figure among the most commonly spoken languages of the British Pakistani community after English. Whilst these people may identify as [...] "Kashmiris", {{most of them are}} not ethnic Kashmiris; rather, their native regions came under the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir in 1846. The first generation migrant Mirpuris were not highly educated, and being from rural settlements, had little or no experience of urban living in Pakistan. Migration from Mirpur and its adjacent areas started soon after the second world war as the majority of the male population of this area and the Potohar region worked in the British armed forces, as well as to fill labour shortages in industry. But the mass <b>migration</b> <b>phenomenon</b> accelerated in the 1960s, when, for improving water supply, the Mangla Dam project was built in the area, flooding the surrounding farmlands. Up to 5,000 people from Mirpur (five percent of the displaced) resettled in Britain. The British contractor undertaking the project provided assistance to the displaced Mirpuris. More Mirpuris joined their relatives in Britain after availing government compensation and liberal migration policies. Cities with large concentration of Mirpuris are Manchester, Bradford, Birmingham, Leeds and Luton. Today, there are an estimated 700,000 people from Azad Kashmir residing in the UK.|$|E
5000|$|A {{second phase}} of the spread of the Dhammakaya {{tradition}} in the UK started {{in the wake of the}} Thai <b>migration</b> <b>phenomenon</b> - one monk from Wat Phra Dhammakaya, Pathum Thani being sent to study for a bachelor's degree at University of Oxford in 1986 and attracting a succession of English people to visit Wat Phra Dhammakaya in Thailand in the period 1987-1991. Phra Maha Wirat Manikanto completed an MA in Buddhist Studies at the University of Bristol in 1997 and during his stay built up a group of Thai supporters mostly from London and Cheltenham who started to organize the first Sunday of the month celebrations from 1998. These were initially at a house in Bristol in 1997. From 21 April 1999 a small house was rented in Wimbledon (within earshot of Wat Buddhapadipa), with Phra Maha Wirat as abbot and Phra Jirasak Caranasampanno, two laymen, Anuchit Treerattanajutawat and Phibul Choompolpaisal supporting the monks while studying for master's degrees in London universities and for a short time a laywoman Sriwan. The tradition registered as a non-profit organization “the Dhammakaya International Society of the United Kingdom” or ‘DISUK’ on 16 April 2002. Later in the same year, in keeping with Dhammakaya Foundation’s policy of rotating personnel, Phra Asadang Siripuñño took over as abbot, moving the temple to a much larger rented premises in Norbury on 7 July 2002. The temple was named Wat Charoenbhavana London. A new abbot, Phrakru Sangharak Wairot Virojano and Phra Thammasarn Cittabhārano took over the running of the temple for the Buddhist lent of 2003. DISUK was granted charitable status on 26 May 2004. At the same time the search continued for a permanent premises for the London temple.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Aim of {{this paper}} is to provide {{reflection}} about research on <b>migration</b> <b>phenomena</b> and especially on the specific contribute of the geographical analysis to it. The issue is initial-ly concerned with the need of recouping a wider perspective and a scientific detach in approaching <b>migration</b> <b>phenomena,</b> in order to put them into the correct interpretative frame. This is especially important with regard to the current events. This result can be obtained by following some steps: first by resuming the classic theo-retical bases of the discipline (geography and economic geography), then by looking at the past scientific literature with a special attention given to territorial contests far from Europe. Finally it is fundamental to take into account the main global demographic (and then consequently geopolitical and geoeconomic) trends that lie behind migration pro-cesses. The paper also invites geographers for becoming more engaged in sharing the evidence of their studies with a larger audience and not only within the Academic community. The research outcomes in this field could be very useful to the common citizens in or-der to fight the misguiding information system that is very actively at work in Italy, es-pecially regarding <b>migration</b> <b>phenomena...</b>|$|R

The values of migration flows (for a permanent residence), related to inter- and intraregional flows constitute a dependent variable. As explanatory variables GDP per capita and registered unemployment rate, for which separate gravity models were specified, including also geographical distance, were selected. Estimation results provide an evaluation of an intensity and direction influence of explanatory variables on <b>migration</b> <b>phenomena.</b> Voivodships about relatively good economic situation are the centres of population inflow (particularly from neighbouring regions) and their net migration is positive.

40|$|Microchannels {{can be used}} {{to induce}} <b>migration</b> <b>phenomena</b> of micron sized {{particles}} in a fluid. Separation processes, like microfiltration, could benefit from particle <b>migration</b> <b>phenomena.</b> Currently, microfiltration is designed around maximum flux, resulting in accumulation of particles in and on the membrane. In this paper it is shown that starting the design at the particle level will result in a new microfiltration process. The behaviour of suspensions between 9 and 38 volume% was studied by confocal scanning laser microscopy; migration as a result of shear-induced diffusion was observed in a rectangular microchannel with nonporous walls. Particles segregated on size within the first 10 cm of the channel. To illustrate this, at 20 volume% of small (1. 53 µm) and large (2. 65 µm) particles each, the larger particles migrated {{to the middle of the}} channel, while the small particles had high concentrations near the walls. The small particles could then be collected from their position close to the permeable walls, e. g. membranes, where the pore size of the membrane is no longer the determining factor for separation. Guidelines for using this phenomenon in a microfiltration process were derived and the selectivity of the process was experimentally evaluated. The small droplets could be removed from the mixtures with a membrane having pores 3. 7 times larger than the droplets, thereby minimizing accumulation of droplets in and on the membrane. As long as the process conditions are chosen appropriately, no droplet deposition takes place and high fluxes (1. 7 × 103 L h- 1 m-² bar- 1) can be maintained...|$|R
