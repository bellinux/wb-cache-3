40|$|Warp in lumber is {{a serious}} problem for the {{building}} industry. In particular, material from small-diameter logs experiences excessive twist. This paper presents a new sawing technique to minimize the problem of twist in material from small-diameter logs. Almost all the studs sawn from small-diameter logs twist in the same positive direction. By rotating the logs during sawing, it is possible to produce studs with a small negative pre-twist. The studs will twist as normal as a result of drying, but, due to the negative pre-twist, the studs will become straighter after drying. To test this new method of sawing, two studs (50 by 100 mm) were sawn from each log. One of the studs was sawn with a small negative pre-twist and the other was sawn to be straight. A total of 100 logs were sawn, resulting in 200 studs. Directly after sawing, the pre-twisted material had a <b>mean</b> <b>twist</b> of - 6 mm/ 100 mm/ 2 m, while the material that was sawn straight had a twist of 0. 1 mm/ 100 mm/ 2 m.

For sufficiently high twist we show that coiling is actually favoured by elastic energy relaxation, when the deformation energy is due to curvature and the <b>mean</b> <b>twist</b> of the filament. We give estimates for the writhing process based purely on curvature information and the number of coils produced.

40|$|Large-scale land {{conversion}} {{for agriculture}} in Brazilian Amazonia is occurring at persistently high rates. Basin-wide net {{land use and}} land cover changes imply substantially different situations between distinct regions and states due to different agricultural policies. This research used eight landscape metrics to quantify and investigate the spatial patterns of cattle pasture and cropland throughout the states of Pará, Mato Grosso, Rondônia, and Amazonas. These metrics were patch density (DEN), mean patch size (MPS), largest patch index (LPI), mean edge density (MED), <b>mean</b> <b>twist</b> number (TWI), corrected perimeter-to-area ratio (CPA), fractal dimension (FDI), and fragmentation index (FRG). A total of 1852 patches were analyzed, originating from 86 samples in 71 different plots, covering a total of 177, 500 km 2 throughout all four states. Principal component analysis showed a partial overlap in the spatial pattern of agricultural patches between all states. The largest percentage of variance was explained by patch area metrics, which {{can be related to}} the different approaches in agricultural policies, but no clear division between the states was identified in this dimension. The metrics quantifying patch shape were de facto independent of deforestation area, and related to the second principal component axis. Although some overlap in this dimension was present as well, these metrics proved a possible measure for discerning the patterns of agriculture attached to a certain state. Different land use policies are hypothesized to lead to more heterogeneity in landscape patterns in an early stage, yet the increasing influence of both cropland and pasture agriculture eventually leads to more uniform landscapes in which spatial differences gradually disappear. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{statistical}} mechanical framework, {{based on a}} variational approximation, to describe closed loop plectonemes. This framework incorporates weak helix structure dependent forces into {{the determination of the}} free energy and average structure of a plectoneme. Notably, due to their chiral nature, helix structure dependent forces break the symmetry between left and right handed supercoiling. The theoretical approach, presented here, also provides a systematic way of enforcing the topological constraint of closed loop supercoiling in the variational approximation. At large plectoneme lengths, by considering correlation functions in an expansion in terms of the spatial <b>mean</b> <b>twist</b> density about its thermally averaged value, {{it can be argued that}} topological constraint may be approximated with by replacing twist and writhe by their thermal averages. A Lagrange Multiplier, containing the sum of average twist and writhe, can be added to the free energy to conveniently inforce this result. The average writhe can be calculated through the thermal average of Gauss integral in the variational approximation. Furthermore, this approach allows for a possible way to calculate finite size corrections due to the topological constraint. Using interaction energy terms from the mean-field Kornyshev-Leikin theory, for parameter values that correspond to weak helix dependent forces, we calculate the free energy, fluctuation magnitudes and mean geometric parameters for the plectoneme. We see a slight asymmetry, where interestingly enough left handed supercoils have looser structure than right handed ones, although a lower free energy, unlike what previous ground state calculations would suggest.

40|$|We study {{gradients}} of {{the energetic}} ion intesity observed {{at the edge}} of the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL) by the energetic ion anisotropy spectrometer (EPAS) on International Sun Earth Explorer 3 (ISEE 3). In particular, we have determined the velocity of the boundary relative to the spacecraft in the direction perpendicular to the tail axis and the angle which the boundary normal makes to the spacecraft spin axis for 1160 PSBL encounters at X(sub GSM) greater than - 240 R(sub E). By asuming that, on average, the edge of the PSBL is parallel to the cross-tail current sheet, we are then able to determine a number of properties of the structure, orientation and motion of the deep geomagnetic tail. We conclude the following: (1) Most crossings of the edge of the PSBL are caused by transverse motuion of the entire tail induced by solar wind direction variations, although some are caused by reconfiguration of the tail due to geomagnetic activity. (2) The typical velocity of the PSBL (and hence of the tail) in the direction perpendicular to the tail axis is 50 - 85 km/s. (3) The average twist of the tail is near zero, with the edge of the PSBL (and by inference the cross-tail current sheet) lying parallel to the ecliptic plane (however, large twists are found in individual events and the distribution of twists is broad, with one standard deviation of approximately 50 deg. (4) The width of the distribution decreases with downtail distance. (5) The variation of the distributions with cross-tail position reveals that this decreas in width is most likely due to the edge of the PSBL being concave, or significantly flared at the tail flanks, in the near-Earth region. (6) During days on which the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) has 'away' sector structure, the north lobe of the trail is twisted on average towards dawn by 7. 0 +/- 2. 4 deg. (7) During days on which the IMF has 'toward' sector structure, the north lobe is tilted towards duskby 3. 8 +/- 2. 3. (8) A subset of events for which IMP 8 solar wind data are available show that, for southward IMF BH(sub z) the tail has a <b>mean</b> <b>twist</b> of - 12. 3 +/- 5. 0 deg for IMF B(sub Y) greater than 0 and 5. 5 +/- 3. 8 deg for IMF B(sub Y) less than 0 (positive twist angles correspond to a tilt of the northern lobe towards dusk). (9) For northward IMF B(sub z) the tail has a twist of - 23. 9 +/- 5. 0 deg for IMF B(sub Y) greater than 0 and 13. 4 +/- 6. 0 deg for IMF B(sub y) less than 0. Hence the tail appears more twisted on average for the IMF B(sub Z) northward case. (10) The distribution of tail twist is wider for lower levels of geomagnetic activity, indicating that the tail is able to twist more at lower levels of activity. (11) The data set reveals no evident effect of the earth's dipole wobble; tail orientation appears to be controlled by the solar wind and IMF, such that the GSE coordinate system may be appropriate for the study of field and plasma structures in the distant tail region...|$|E

40|$|The Sun, by {{the virtue}} of its {{proximity}} to Earth, serves as an excellent astrophysical laboratory for testing our theoretical ideas. The Sun displays a plethora of visually awe-inspiring phenomena including flares, prominences, sunspots, corona, CMEs and uncountable others. It is now known {{that it is the}} magnetic field of the Sun which governs all these and also the geomagnetic storms at the Earth, which owes its presence to the interaction between the geomagnetic field and the all-pervading Solar magnetic field in the interplanetary medium. Since the solar magnetic field affects the interplanetary space around the Earth in a profound manner, it is absolutely essential that we develop a comprehensive understanding of the generation and manifestation of magnetic fields of the Sun. This thesis aims at developing a state-of-the-art dynamo code SURYA 1 taking into account important results from helioseismology and magnetohydrodynamics. This dynamo code is then used to study various phenomenon associated with solar activity including evolution of solar parity, response to stochastic fluctuations, helicity of active regions and prediction of future solar cycles. Within last few years dynamo theorists seem to have reached a consensus on the basic characteristics of a solar dynamo model. The solar dynamo is now believed to be comprised of three basic processes: (i) The toroidal field is produced by stretching of poloidal field lines primarily inside the tachocline – the region of strong radial shear {{at the bottom of the}} convection zone. (ii) The toroidal field so formed rises to the surface due to magnetic buoyancy to form active regions. (iii) Poloidal field is generated at the surface due to decay of tilted active regions – an idea attributed to Babcock (1961) & Leighton (1969). The meridional circulation then carries the poloidal field produced near the surface to the tachocline. The profile of the solar differential rotation has now been mapped by helioseismology and so has been the poleward branch of meridional circulation near the surface. The model I describe in this thesis is a two-dimensional kinematic solar dynamo model in a full sphere. Our dynamo model Surya was developed over the years in stages by Prof. Arnab Rai Choudhuri, Dr. Mausumi Dikpati, Dr. Dibyendu Nandy and myself. We provide all the technical details of our model in Chap. 2 of this thesis. In this model we assume the equatorward branch of the meridional circulation (which hasn’t been observed yet), to penetrate slightly below the tachocline (Nandy & Choudhuri 2002, Science, 296, 1671). Such a meridional circulation plays an important role in suppressing the magnetic flux eruptions at high latitudes. The only non-linearity included in the model is the prescription of magnetic buoyancy. Our model is shown to reproduce various aspects of observational data, including the phase relation between sunspots and the weak, efficient. An important characteristic of our code is that it displays solar-like dipolar parity (anti-symmetric toroidal fields across equator) when certain reasonable conditions are satisfied, the most important condition being the requirement that the poloidal field should diffuse efficiently to get coupled across the equator. When the magnetic coupling between the hemispheres is enhanced by either increasing the diffusion or introducing an α ff distributed throughout the convection zone, we find that the solutions in the two hemispheres evolve together with a single period even when we make the meridional circulation or the α effect different in the two hemispheres. The effect of diffusive coupling in our model is investigated in Chap. 3. After having explored the regular behaviour of the solar cycle using the dynamo code we proceed to study the irregularities of the Solar cycle. We introduce stochastic fluctuations in the poloidal source term at the solar surface keeping the meridional circulation steady for all the numerical experiments. The dynamo displays oscillatory behaviour with variable cycle amplitudes in presence of fluctuations with amplitudes as large as 200 %. We also find a statistically significant correlation between the strength of polar fields at the endofone cycle and the sunspot number of the next cycle. In contrast to this there exist a very poor correlation between the sunspot number of a cycle and the polar field formed at its end. This suggests that during the declining phase of the sunspot cycle poloidal field generation from decaying spots takes place via the Babcock-Leighton mechanism which involves randomness and destroys the correlation between sunspot number of a cycle and the polar at its end. In addition to this we also see that the time series of asymmetries in the sunspot activity follows the time series of asymmetries in the polar field strength with a lag of 5 years. We also compare our finding with available observational data. Although systematic measurements of the Sun’s polar magnetic field exist only from mid- 1970 s, other proxies can be used to infer the polar field at earlier times. The observational data indicate a strong correlation between the polar field at a sunspot minimum and the strength of the next cycle, although the strength of the cycle is not correlated well with the polar field produced at its end. We use these findings about the correlation of polar fields with sunspots to develop an elegant method for predicting future solar cycles. We feed observational data for polar fields during the minima of cycle n into our dynamo model and run the code till the next minima in order to simulate the sunspot number curve for cycle n+ 1. Our results fit the observed sunspot numbers of cycles 21 - 23 reasonably well and predict that cycle 24 will be about 30 – 35 % weaker than cycle 23. We fit that the magnetic diffusivity in the model plays an important role in determining the magnetic memory of the Solar dynamo. For low diffusivity, the amplitude of a sunspot cycle appears to be a complex function of the history of the polar field of earlier cycles. Only if the magnetic diffusivity within the convection zone is assumed to be high (of order 1012 cms− 1), we are able to explain the correlation between the polar fiat a minimum and the next cycle. We give several independent arguments that the diffusivity must be of this order. In a dynamo model with diffusivity like this, the poloidal field generated at the mid-latitudes is advected toward the poles by the meridional circulation and simultaneously diffuses towards the tachocline, where the toroidal field for the next cycle is produced. The above ideas are put forward in Chap. 6. We next come to an important product of the dynamo process namely the magnetic helicity. It has been shown independently by many research groups that the mean value of the normalized current helicity αp= B (Δ×B) /B 2 in solar active regions is of the order of 10 − 8 m− 1, predominantly negative in the northern hemisphere, positive in the southern hemisphere. Choudhuri (2003, Sol. Phys., 215, 31) developed a model for production of the helicity of the required sign in a Babcock-Leighton Dynamo by wrapping of poloidal field lines around a fluxtube rising through the convection zone. In Chap. 7 we calculate helicities of solar active regions based on this idea. Rough estimates based on this idea compare favourably with the observed magnitude of helicity. We use our solar dynamo model to study how helicity varies with latitude and time. At the time of solar maximum, our theoretical model gives negative helicity in the northern hemisphere and positive helicity in the south, in accordance with observed hemispheric trends. However, we fit that during a short interval at the beginning of a cycle, helicities tend to be opposite of the preferred hemispheric trends. After calculating the sign and magnitude of helicity of the sunspots we worry about the distribution of helicity inside a sunspot. In Chap. 8 we model the penetration of a wrapped up background poloidal field into a toroidal magnetic flux tube rising through the solar convective zone. The rise of the straight, cylindrical flux tube is followed by numerically solving the induction equation in a comoving Lagrangian frame, while an external poloidal magnetic field is assumed to be radially advected onto the tube with a speed corresponding to the rise velocity. One prediction of our model is the existence of a ring of reverse current helicity on the periphery of active regions. On the other hand, the amplitude of the resulting twist depends sensitively on the assumed structure (ffvs. concentrated/intermittent) of the active region magnetic field right before its emergence, and on the assumed vertical profile of the poloidal field. Nevertheless, in the model with the most plausible choice of assumptions a <b>mean</b> <b>twist</b> comparable to the observational results.

We say the heart to express emotion, the head to denote thought; and thought and emotion are words borrowed from sensible things, and now appropriated to spiritual nature. Most of the process by which this transformation is made, is hidden from us in the remote time when language was framed; but the same tendency may be daily observed in children. Children and savages use only nouns or names of things, which they convert into verbs, and apply to analogous mental acts.|$|R
50|$|FTTB (fiber-to-the-building or -basement) {{is a form}} of fiber-optic {{communication}} delivery that necessarily {{applies only}} to those properties that contain multiple living or working spaces. The optical fiber terminates before actually reaching the subscribers living or working space itself, but does extend to the property containing that living or working space. The signal is conveyed the final distance using any non-optical <b>means,</b> including <b>twisted</b> pair, coaxial cable, wireless, or power line communication.|$|R

We apply these inequalities to study cohomology of the fixed points set of a symplectic torus action. We show {{that in this case}} our inequalities are perfect, i. e. they are in fact equalities.

40|$|For a given quasitriangular Hopf algebra H {{we study}} {{relations}} between the braided group ˜ H ∗ and Drinfeld’s twist. We show that the braided bialgebra structure of ˜ H ∗ is naturally described by <b>means</b> of <b>twisted</b> tensor powers of H and their module algebras. We introduce universal solution to the reflection equation (RE) and deduce a fusion prescription for RE-matrices. Key words: reflection equation, twist, fusion procedure.

40|$|International audienceThe natural {{character}} of plant fibres was {{often cited as}} a disadvantage which results in the scattering of their properties. This work aims at studying the influence of this scattering on the stiffness of an epoxy-flax fibres twill fabric ply. Elastic coefficients were estimated using an analytical model in an elliptical configuration based {{on the use of}} the classical laminate theory. Most of flax fibre elastic coefficients were obtained in the literature; in addition, a flax fibre Poisson's ratio of 0. 498 was estimated from an experimentally inverse approach. Then, the use of the analytical model evidenced that the Young's moduli of woven composite were strongly correlated to longitudinal and transversal fibre ones; moreover, the fibre transversal modulus had a significant impact on the Poisson's ratios of the composite. As regards to the yam configuration and architecture, we showed that the <b>mean</b> <b>twisting</b> angle significantly affected stiffness and Poisson's ratio of the composite; in the same way, the importance of waviness described by its waviness ratio was underlined whereas the scattering into yam morphology had low influence on composite performances when the waviness ratio was high.

40|$|Although carbon {{nanotubes}} {{consist of}} honeycomb carbon, {{they have never}} been fabricated from graphene directly. Here, it is shown by quantum molecular-dynamics simulations and classical continuum-elasticity modeling, that graphene nanoribbons can, indeed, be transformed into carbon nanotubes by <b>means</b> of <b>twisting.</b> The chiralities of the tubes thus fabricated can be not only predicted but also externally controlled. This twisting route is an opportunity for nanofabrication, and is easily generalizable to ribbons made of other planar nanomaterials. Comment: 9 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
