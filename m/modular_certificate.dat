We prove non-repudiation from a mild extension of theSDH assumption, which we introduce and justify meticulously. 1 Introduction We introduce mesh signatures, which are similar in spirit and purpose to the ring signatures of Rivest, Shamir, and Tauman [27], and extend them in a few crucial ways. Ring signatures are pseudonymous signatures that are issued {{in the name of a}} &quot;ring &quot; of users, and created by one of them without the participation of the others, in a way that preserves the instigator's anonymity. The canonical application is for an individual &quot;to leak a secret &quot; non-repudiably on behalf of a crowd. Technically, ring signatures can be viewed as a witness-indistinguishable disjunction of regular signatures, but because of this, only people who have previously published a verification key are eligible to be enrolled in such a crowd. Ring signatures can thus only ever implicate individuals who, by the very act of publishing their key, are proclaiming their consent...|$|E

They are made using artificial reefs underwater, to counter illegal fishing and Promote the attraction of marine organisms and in particular ensure a particular environment type nursery, sparking a natural food chain capable of supporting juveniles of different species. The underwater barriers have been realized with <b>modular</b> structures <b>certificates</b> type "sea-friendly", according to the UNI EN ISO 14001 : 2004 for the sector artificial barriers, pre-assembled on the ground by means of bolts of stainless steel marine at low-carbon. The structures were lowered into the sea and geo-referenced, to form a "reef" of "atolls", of about 250, 000 a m 2 at a bathymetry within 15 and 20 m of depth. The facilities are equipped with holes and space irregulars that reproduce a natural environment and have a pyramidal shape. Those pyramids are easily colonized by fouling and provide shelter and a chance to reproduction for many aquatic organisms, particularly for the fish species of high market value. The objectives of the artificial reefs are: on the one hand encouraging the repopulation of the marine areas concerned {{and at the same time}} achieve a optimal high productivity and reduce the fishing effort using the sustainable fishing methods from the environmental point of view, compatible with the system of barriers / atolls of the reef artificial, entrusting the management of a fishery to an cooperative organization type OP (Organization of Production), able to organize and manage a coordinated system of fishing and regulated by specific rules based on monitoring and sampling for the certification the presence and consistence of the biomass, the seasonal of fishing operations, compliance with the quantity of fishing and the selectivity of fishing techniques. The system so designed would allow sustainable production of species of fish of high commercial value and proper management of the marine protected area that will provide new income opportunities for small commercial fishing, as well as ensuring the protection and recovery of the sea vast areas...|$|R
40|$|This work based {{study is}} not only a stand alone project but can also be read in {{conjunction}} with other work based studies carried out by members of the Society of Practising Veterinary Surgeons (SPVS) Doctorate Group. This group worked through the National Centre for Work Based Learning Partnerships (NCWBLP) based at Middlesex University. The customisation of the studies was carried out by the Professional Development Foundation (PDF). The purpose of the group was to facilitate the development of postgraduate veterinary education in general practice in order to maintain lifelong learning within the profession. Within this framework this study sets out to investigate the difficulties faced by practitioner researchers in publication. The aim of the study is to increase not only the number of manuscripts published by practitioners but also {{to increase the number of}} practitioners carrying out publication. To achieve these aims the author has evaluated the existing veterinary peer reviewed journal journals with a view to answering the question “does the veterinary profession in the UK need a new peer reviewed journal?” The author of the study has written a book to aid practitioners with publication. The sparse veterinary literature is reviewed together with the relevant medical literature. A historical analysis was carried out on the four most commonly read veterinary peer reviewed journals, the Veterinary Record (VR), the Equine Veterinary Journal (EVJ), Equine Veterinary Education (EV) and the Journal of Small Animal Practice (JSAP). Five separate case studies were carried out on successful practitioner authors, successful practitioner authors, editors of peer reviewed veterinary journals, newly qualified veterinary surgeons and final year veterinary students. The quantitative and qualitative results were recorded ethically and analysed. These results were then critically discussed and commented on. The methods of learning, experienced by the practitioner author were reflected upon. Conclusions were then reached. These showed that the main reason for lack of publication by practitioners was the relatively few manuscripts submitted by relatively few practitioners. There was no bias shown by editors against practitioner authors. Some improvements were suggested for the journals but it was concluded that at the present time there was no need for a new veterinary peer reviewed journal. However EVJ, EVE and JSAP have agreed to have a major drive to increase practitioner input. The benefits of the project to the profession were recorded. They included a regular updated list of successful practitioner authors willing to help less experienced colleagues, with publication, to be shown on the web page of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS). The agreement of the RCVS scientific committee to encourage in-practice research by co-ordinating funding. The agreement of DEFRA to regularly fund a residential course on in-practice research for practitioners at Cambridge Veterinary School and to fund resulting pieces of practitioner research. The agreement of the editor of the VR to appoint a sub-editor to help with publication of these projects. The whole doctorate group project, of designing an award for advanced veterinary general practice, was accomplished. The <b>modular</b> <b>certificate</b> was accepted by the RCVS. This certificate was designed to have other modules added. The project by the author included the designing and acceptance of three additional modules to allow an award in equine dentistry. Lastly a secondary finding of the project, that newly qualified veterinary graduates were under considerable pressure in practice, was exposed. The author at a local level took action. The British Veterinary Association observed this. Consultations were carried out. A new graduate mentoring project was then successfully launched nationally. The author played a key role in this initiative both nationally and locally...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{it has become}} {{increasingly}} evident that nextgeneration systems will be strongly distributed, networked heterogeneous systems of systems. New corresponding computing paradigms have been coined along the way, such as Ubiquitous Computing, Ambient Intelligence, and, more recently, Cyber-Physical Systems. It is expected that such systems will be open with respect to dynamic integration and adaptive with respect to dynamic changes in their environments. Considering that many application domains of such next-generation systems are inherently safety-critical, it is a common requirement for them to be safe - despite being open and adaptive. However, established safety assurance and certification approaches, both state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art ones, are not applicable to that context. As a first solution approach, this thesis presents a framework that enables conditional safety certification for open adaptive systems. <b>Modular</b> conditional safety <b>certificates</b> (ConSerts) are introduced as the core solution concept. ConSerts contain a series of formalized guarantee-demand relationships and can be composed and evaluated at runtime. The evaluation result can be interpreted as a runtime safety certificate that supports the autonomous decision of whether the integrated system is currently safe to run or not. For the operationalization of ConSerts, adequate support for dynamic integration and adaptation as well as appropriate modularization concepts and mapping functions have been established. Moreover, it is shown how the ConSert models can be transformed into a suitable runtime representation, and mechanisms and protocols have been defined that operate on these runtime representations to conduct the dynamic evaluation of dynamically integrated systems of systems. Finally, it is elaborated how the presented approach can be integrated with established engineering methodologies to provide guidance with respect to the required safety engineering backbone for conditional safety certification in concrete settings. The results of the validation show that the approach is feasible and can be operationalized effectively, thus potentially opening up a path towards approaches to runtime safety certification of open adaptive system. At the same time, these results highlight limitations and areas of future improvement...|$|R
