50|$|In 75 BC Caecilius Metellus and Pompey {{advanced}} {{from the}} Pyrenees and Sertorius and Perpenna (another rebel commander) from Lusitania. Metellus defeated Perpenna. Pompey and Sertorius then hastily {{engaged in an}} indecisive battle by the River Sucro in order to fight {{before the arrival of}} Caecilius Metellus. Pompey wanted to fight alone and Sertorius wanted only one opponent. Sertorius defeated Afrianius, Pompey’s lieutenant, on the left wing. Pompey was having the better on the other wing. Sertorius intervened there, rallied his men, stopped their retreat and routed the other enemy wing. Pompey was seriously wounded in the thigh. However, while Sertorius left his right wing Afrianius routed this wing. The next day the two sides prepared for the continuation of the battle. However, Metellus approached and Sertorius withdrew as he often did as part of his guerrilla tactics. Soon after this Sertorius defeated Pompey near Seguntia. Pompey lost nearly 6,000 men and Sertorius half of that. Memmius, the most capable of Pompey's commanders, also fell. Metellus defeated Perpenna, who lost 5,000 men. According to Appian the next day Sertorius attacked his camp unexpectedly, but he withdrew because Pompey was approaching. According to Plutarch, instead, there was a battle and Metellus was struck by a spear. His men rallied and pushed the enemy back. Sertorius withdrew to a mountain stronghold and repaired its walls to lure the Romans into a siege and sent officers to collect troops from other towns. He then made a sortie, passed through the enemy lines and joined his new force. He resumed his guerrilla tactics and cut off the enemy's supplies with widespread raids. Pirate tactics at sea disrupted <b>maritime</b> <b>supplies.</b> This forced the two Roman commanders to separate. Metellus went to Gaul. Pompey wintered among the Vaccaei and suffered shortages of supplies. When Pompey spent most of his private resources on the war he asked the senate for money, threatening to go back to Italy with his army if this was refused. The consuls Lucius Licinius Lucullus was canvassing for the command of the Third Mithridatic War. He feared that Pompey would leave the Sertorian War to take on the Mithridatic one. It was thought that this war would bring glory with little difficulty. Thus, he ensured that the money was sent to ensure that Pompey remained in Hispania.|$|E

40|$|D. Phil. The {{progress}} of the South African economy relies heavily upon earnings from physical exports, which depend increasingly upon the competitiveness in global markets of the <b>maritime</b> <b>supply</b> chains that serve the country. Competition in world markets is becoming increasingly stronger as production resources are obtained globally and subsequently the competition exists between the effectiveness of whole supply chains rather than only production costs. South Africa therefore has great interest in ensuring that its <b>maritime</b> <b>supply</b> chains compare with world best practice. Amongst other things, this world best practice requires those chains to function as entities structured to serve their logistical purpose, i. e. {{that it should not}} include links consisting of separate transport businesses. In practice, this requires that links traditionally provided by third parties be structurally integrated as cost centres instead of profits centres in the chains. Such integrated <b>maritime</b> <b>supply</b> chains will inevitably only be developed by the intervention of chain leaders. South Africa’s major supply chains conveying commodities and manufactured products are examined {{in order to determine the}} scope for the integration of their links as a means of raising their efficiency as ‘complete chains’. Features of selected <b>maritime</b> <b>supply</b> chains serving other countries that could serve as models for the structuring of South Africa’s are identified. Transnet’s role in the existing <b>maritime</b> <b>supply</b> chains in accordance with the policy of the Government is examined and attention is focused on the under-investment in recent years that has led to the deterioration in the company’s performance. The rejection by the Government of the privatisation of the core assets of the railways and ports in favour of public-private partnerships, as a means of overcoming the problems, is considered in order to conclude whether a solution will be forthcoming in that manner. Special consideration is given to Transnet’s proposed spending of R 40 bn on infrastructure projects and attention is focused on the fact that this will not address all the problems. The marine links in South Africa’s <b>maritime</b> <b>supply</b> chains are currently provided by foreigners. Virtually all South Africa’s bulk exports are sold free-on-board, which concedes control over the shipping of the cargo to foreign importers. Reasons for such arrangements are complex and chartering by South African exporters in order to maintain control is often not feasible, although it is done in the fruit trade and by Australian exporters of iron ore competing with South African exporters. Ship owning by South Africans will facilitate new legislation to increase the market share of citizens in the country’s exports and imports, but price-wise market entry will be difficult and it is debatable whether exporters will make use of their services. In the liner trades, the trend is for shipping companies to integrate port and overland links into their services, and the efficiency of South Africa’s container supply chains will need to be raised in that manner. The criteria for determining <b>maritime</b> <b>supply</b> chain efficiency and the integration of the links of particular South African chains based on their cost structures, as well as the leadership needed to pursue such development, are motivated. Proposals are also made for the integration of the links of the iron ore and coal supply chains under the leadership of public-private partnerships, as well as for a container supply chain incorporating both a dedicated terminal in the Port of Ngqura and the railway between Coega and Gauteng, under the leadership of a liner shipping company or consortium of companies. The conclusion is reached that the present role of Transnet in accordance with the declared policy of the Government is not conducive to improving <b>maritime</b> <b>supply</b> chain efficiency through the structural integration of the links. It is also concluded that the efficiency of the chains could be raised through private leadership with public participation, subject to a change in the Government’s policy towards the role of Transnet in order to allow such leadership.

40|$|Macroeconomic freight {{transport}} models serve as decision support for transport policy development. To evaluate infrastructure investments or policy measures these tools need {{to capture the}} underlying complexity of {{freight transport}} networks in a sufficient way. Recent developments in this field outline possibilities to combine aggregated and disaggregated approaches in freight transport modelling in order to integrate more realistic freight agent behaviour. In contrast to aggregated models, disaggregated approaches are able to simulate the decision behaviour on the microlevel of an individual decision maker. In <b>maritime</b> container <b>supply</b> chains liner carriers or their brokers/agents and freight forwarders face a variety of interconnected logistical choices such as carrier, port, mode, route, shipment, or inventory choice.

40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} the {{different}} concepts of “vulnerability” used in <b>maritime</b> <b>supply</b> chains, {{and to develop a}} novel framework with supporting models to identify and analyze the relevant vulnerabilities in the chains. A real case of the Maersk shipping line in its Asia-Europe route is studied to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework. We find that the investigated network has stronger robustness against random failures than that when facing deliberate attacks. Furthermore, to identify vulnerable nodes (i. e. ports) of the network, two different types of analysis are undertaken through a multi-centrality model and a robustness analysis model, respectively. Consequently, the vulnerabilities estimated through robustness analysis can ascertain those by the classical centrality methods when they appear on both analysis results. More importantly, the similarity between the two outcomes can help gain more confidence on the accuracy in terms of the identification of the vulnerabilities in the system, while the difference (if any) such as those identified by the robustness analysis but not by the centrality analysis (or vice versa) can trigger a further investigation to find the comprehensive vulnerable nodes against different threats/hazards.

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} - Systematic {{integration}} of supply chain interfaces enables port industries to compete effectively in the global marketplace. The purpose {{of this paper}} is to explore the integration issues in port operations and furthermore identify the necessary components of an Integrated Logistics Platform (ILP) that can be used as a framework for systematic integration. Design/methodology/approach - To prepare this paper, a study of the logistics literature was conducted together with an indepth case study. To analyze the data, a theoretical model was developed using a well known supply chain management (SCM) framework and value-chain mechanism. The study examines three elements related to port industries; network structures, key business processes and selected management components. Findings - The key elements for successful implementation of the ILP revealed from the case studies are: supply chain coordination, business processes integration and system optimization. Associated with these key elements, two value-chain mechanisms were assumed to be imperative: combined transport carrying capacity and the automatic match between the facility-based operations and the transport distribution network. Practical implications (if applicable) - The framework presented in this paper is valuable for companies within the port industry. It will furthermore benefit all members of the <b>maritime</b> <b>supply</b> chains and useful for developing corporate customer value.
