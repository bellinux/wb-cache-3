25|$|The Endowed School was {{inspected}} by OFSTED in 2003 and 2008. In 2003 the inspectors' overall evaluation was that 'this {{is a very}} good school.' In 2008 the inspectors agreed with the School's own self-evaluation that the School is providing 'a satisfactory standard of education' and that 'many elements are good'. The 2003 OFSTED inspection had identified <b>modern</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>languages</b> as unsatisfactory. However, in 2008 the inspectors noted {{that there had been a}} 'great improvement in the leadership of <b>modern</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>languages</b> since the last inspection.' An OFSTED inspection has recently taken place, the school received a 'satisfactory' in most areas, pupil's behavior being one of the best, rated as 'good', while the maths department was the least achievable. OFSTED stated that the improvement in maths and English was a minor improvement and more work should be done to improve. From parents, they noted that many teachers have been on leave, saying that it disrupts their child's learning capabilities.|$|E
25|$|The Middlebury College Language Schools {{offers a}} Doctor of Modern Languages. Unique to Middlebury, the D.M.L. prepares teacher-scholars in two <b>modern</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>languages,</b> helping them develop as {{teachers}} of second-language acquisition, literature, linguistics, and language pedagogy. Middlebury also offers summer language immersion programs in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, and Spanish to {{middle and high}} school students through the Middlebury-Monterey Language Academy.|$|E

Besides English, the standard modern languages are French and German, although schools can replace one of these modern languages with Spanish, Turkish, Arabic, or Russian. Additionally, schools in Friesland teach and have exams in West Frisian, and schools across the country teach and have exams in Ancient Greek and Latin for secondary school (called Gymnasium or VWO+).|$|E

Chemistry and physics {{are the most}} popular Pre-U subjects, closely followed by history and English literature. Philosophy and theology are also popular. There is no great number of GCSE choices either: all boys sit IGCSEs in at least two of three sciences, Maths, English, GCSE Latin, and usually three or four other subjects which include: <b>modern</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>languages,</b> Greek, Geography, Art, DT and Music.|$|E
25|$|The {{teaching}} of <b>modern</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>languages</b> at Newcastle predates {{the creation of}} Newcastle University itself, as in 1911 Armstrong College in Newcastle installed Albert George Latham, its first professor of modern languages. Often in the School's history, the high quality of its teaching, research and student experience have been recognised. In the 2015 edition of the Guardian University Guide, the school was ranked 14 out of 63. In the 2014 edition of the Sunday Times Good University Guide, Iberian Studies, French and German in the School were each placed in the top ten for their subject across the UK. (East Asian Studies does not feature in this Guide.) In the 2013 National Student Survey, Spanish in the School came 6th in the UK for overall student satisfaction, and German came 7th.|$|E
25|$|The School of Modern Languages at Newcastle is {{also very}} active in {{outreach}} work. It is the Lead Institution in the North East Routes into Languages Consortium and together with the Durham University, Northumbria University, the University of Sunderland, the Teesside University and a network of schools, undertakes work activities of discovery of languages for the 9 to 13 years pupils. This implies having festivals, Q sessions, language tasters, or quizzes organised, {{as well as a}} web learning work aiming at constructing a web portal to link language learners across the region. There is a range of on-campus activities like the Linguacast On-Campus: 10 and 12 years pupils come and learn more about the practice and teaching of language; they visit Newcastle campus to produce <b>Modern</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>languages</b> (MFL) web material and study it back in school. The SML provides structures from their linguistic communities so as to set up taster or revisions sessions.|$|E

2500|$|Justice McReynolds wrote two early {{decisions}} {{using the}} Fourteenth Amendment to protect civil liberties: Meyer v. Nebraska , and Pierce v. Society of Sisters [...] Meyer involved {{a state law}} that prohibited the teaching of <b>modern</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>languages</b> in public schools. Meyer, who taught German in a Lutheran school, was convicted under this law. McReynolds wrote that the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment included an individual's right [...] "to contract, to engage {{in any of the}} common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, to establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his conscience, and generally to enjoy privileges, essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men". These two decisions survived the post-Lochner era.|$|E
6000|$|There is, however, a {{thing that}} was once done in schools as a {{convenient}} accomplishment, and which has--with that increase in communication which is the salient material fact of the nineteenth century--developed in Western Europe to the dimensions of a political necessity, {{and that is the}} teaching of one or more <b>modern</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>languages.</b> The language-teaching of all previous periods has been done with a view to culture, artistic, {{as in the case of}} Elizabethan Italian, or intellectual as with English Latin. But the language- teaching of to-day is deliberately, almost conscientiously, not for culture. It would, I am sure, be a very painful and shocking thought indeed to an English parent to think that French was taught in school with a view to reading French books. It is taught as a vulgar necessity for purposes of vulgar communication. The stirring together of the populations that is going on, the fashion and facilities for travel, the production of the radii from the trading foci, are rapidly making a commonplace knowledge of French, German, and Italian a necessity to the merchant and tradesman, and the ever more extensive travelling class. So that so far as Europe goes, one may very well regard this modern modern-language teaching as--with the modern mathematics--an extension of the trivium, of the apparatus, that is, of thought and expression. [Footnote: In the United States there is less sense of urgency about modern languages, but sooner or later the American may wake up to the need of Spanish in his educational schemes.] It is an extension and a very doubtful improvement. It is a modern necessity, a rather irksome necessity, of little or no essential educational value, an unavoidable duty the school will have to perform. [Footnote: In one way the foreign language may be made educationally very useful, and that is as an exercise in writing translations into good English.] ...|$|E
