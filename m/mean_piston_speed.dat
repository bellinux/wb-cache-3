Measurements were made of the cylinder pressure during the inlet stroke and of the power output and volumetric efficiency. Measurements were also made, with the engine not running, to determine the resistance and mass of air in the inlet valve port at various crank angles. Results of analysis indicate that mass has an appreciable effect, but friction plays the major part in restricting flow. The observed fact that the volumetric efficiency is considerably less than 100 percent is attributed to thermal effects.

40|$|Development of an {{apparatus}} capable of hosting combustion processes at volumetric compression ratios {{in excess of}} 100 : 1 and <b>mean</b> <b>piston</b> <b>speeds</b> of order 100 m/s has been successfully completed. Non-reacting gas compression tests indicate that the current piston/ring design is capable of achieving pressures as high as 90 % of their isentropic values (based on volume) with a repeatability of about 1 %. These values are more than adequate for a systematic investigation of combustion at extreme states. Two preliminary, light-load combustion tests have just been conducted using methanol and diesel as fuels. While these initial results are more symbolic than systematic, they indicate that our strategies for fuel injection, injection synchronization, and energy (work) extraction are also functioning correctly, {{and that we are}} well positioned to investigate the requirements for combustion under very high-speed, extreme compression conditions. In a parallel effort, we continue to investigate what is possible in the design space of ultra-high efficiency engines. While previous efforts focused on batch engine geometries (i. e., piston-cylinder), efforts during the past year have focused on understanding efficiency optimization for steady-flow (i. e., turbine) engines. Although similar in many respects, a key difference is the inability of these engines to provide reversible work interactions. Although still leading to a form of the same extreme-states principle that led to the experimental work cited above, this research shows that there exist intrinsic limitations on the state to which the working fluid may be compressed due to the inherent irreversibilities of the turbomachinery. Equally important, is that our preliminary assessment indicates that these states are well outside of the current engine operating envelope such that the possibility exists for significant improvement in the efficiency of steady flow combustion engines...|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigates the}} flow {{characteristic}} in novel cylinder head at various port size and runner length. Novel cylinder head engine is a design engine that operates in a 4 -stroke operational cycle. This engine uses a second opposed piston in designed cylinder head that moves at half the cyclical {{rate of the}} main piston, thus giving six piston movements per cycle. Functionally, the second piston replaces the valve mechanism of a conventional engine. Intake and exhaust poppet valve is replaced with two-stroke reed valve and exhaust port similar with two-stroke engine mechanism. The flow in a pipe of an engine exhaust and/or inlet system is treated as one dimensional. This means that the pressures, temperatures and flow velocities obtained from {{the solution of the}} gas dynamic equations represent mean values over the cross-section of the pipes. 1 -d simulation tool used in this investigation is GT-power. Simulation runs with limitation of port size not exceed 70 % size of cylinder head and exhaust length is limit to length of the motorcycle. The parameters investigated are volumetric efficiency of engine at difference engine <b>speed</b> and <b>mean</b> <b>pistons</b> <b>speed.</b> The parameter to investigate is flow rate during motoring only. The engine speed is limited to 4000 rpm related to maximum torque of original engine. Volumetric efficiency is increase with bigger intake port and smaller exhaust port. Elongations of the exhaust pipes give an improvement potential of the engine efficiency. The optimal value to choose in the novel cylinder head from the simulation result is at intake port size of 24 mm and exhaust port 16 mm as it has the optimal efficiency.

The Triumph vertical twin used a ball on the timing side, and a roller on the other, with the oil feeding through a separate bronze bush in the outer right hand engine side cover.Whereas the Norton 650SS 646.44 cc had a bore and stroke of 68 x 89 mm giving [...] @ 6,800 rpm, the Triumph T120 Bonneville 649.31 cc had a bore and stroke of 71 x 82 mm giving [...] @ 6,500 rpm.

40|$|In {{four-stroke}} S. I. engines, {{direct injection}} allows reducing fresh charge temperature (fuel evaporation heat is subtracted from air, not from inlet valves and ducts), with benefits for volumetric efficiency, combustion efficiency and knocking resistance that allows higher compression ratios [1 - 3]. As a result, engine power and fuel economy increase. If direct injection {{is associated with}} charge stratification, further benefits in fuel economy occur at partial loads, due to lower combustion temperatures, unthrottled operation and smaller heat flow to combustion chamber walls [4]. However, direct injection is justified only if it leads to significant improvements in engine performance compared to the most performing indirect injection systems. This explains {{the progress of the}} direct injection & charge stratification technique from wall-guided to purely air-guided spray, up to the most recent technique consisting in self-guided spray by outward-opening injectors. This last solution reduces flow field constraints and renders stratification less sensitive to engine operating conditions changes. As well, these injectors give significant benefits in homogeneous-charge operation especially when dealing with high-performance engines, since they improve charge micro-homogeneity and fuel distribution at high engine speeds. This occurs somewhat independently from any particular flow field feature and combustion chamber shape. In consequence, more freedom is allowed in combustion chamber design that can be better aimed at achieving high thermal and volumetric efficiency and as well permits simple and hence light pistons, required by high-performance engines with high <b>mean</b> <b>piston</b> <b>speeds.</b> Accordingly, a numerical study has been conducted, aimed at verifying the feasibility and at predicting the benefits of direct injection by outward-opening injectors, in the case of Lamborghini V 12 engine, presently equipped with an indirect injection system.

In fact, before NASCAR instituted the gear rule, Cup engines were capable of operating more than 10,000 rpm.

At the backbone 1.5- to 2.0-mile tri-oval tracks of NASCAR, the engines produce over 850 hp running 92-9400 rpm for 500 miles, 600 mi for the Coca-Cola 600 Charlotte race.|$|E
50|$|Two {{of these}} engines, the {{enlarged}} single-row Hornet B described {{here and the}} R-1830 Twin Wasp, were of near-identical displacement (1860 vs. 1830), although the fourteen-cylinder Twin Wasp was more complex and costly than the nine-cylinder, single-row Hornet B. The Twin Wasp {{was by far the}} more powerful engine though, even in its early versions it produced 800 bhp to the Hornet B's 575 bhp. Having more cylinders per the same displacement also creates a smoother engine, since the individual pistons are smaller and lighter, and the stroke is shorter, which reduces the vibration of reciprocation, and therefore crew and mechanical fatigue. The reduced stroke also allows for a higher maximum RPM limit, since the <b>mean</b> <b>piston</b> <b>speed</b> is reduced, the distance the piston has to cover per each engine revolution being shorter. Having a shorter stroke but a higher rpm limit for the same displacement reduces the peak torque levels, but allows for a higher maximum horsepower rating. A further advantage was the reduced diameter of the Wasp: 48 inches compared to 57. This reduced drag, and the relatively large diameter of the Hornet would also have been a serious drawback for visibility if used in a small single-engined aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The mean of any {{function}} {{refers to}} the average value. In the case of <b>mean</b> <b>piston</b> <b>speed,</b> taken in a narrow mathematical sense, it is zero because half {{of the time the}} piston is moving up and half of the time the piston is moving down; this is not useful. The way the term is usually used is to describe the distance traveled by the piston per unit of time, taking distance positive in both up and down senses. It is related to the rate that friction work is done on the cylinder walls, and thus the rate that heat generated there.This is sort of a non-puzzle. It represents a specification to be designed to rather than as a result of. I'm not an ME but I have built many engines of various types over the years and the mean piston velocity {{is a function of the}} revolutions per minute, that is, the piston at a specific rpm is going to be the same at the peak of the graph as it is at the trough, that is at 286.071 degrees on the crankshaft if the rpm is held consistent. At 0 and 180 degrees, the piston velocity is zero.Piston velocity is a test of the strength of the piston and connecting rod subassembly. The alloy used to make the piston itself is what determines the maximum velocity that the piston can reach before friction coefficients, heat levels and reciprocating stress overcome the maximum levels that the piston can sustain before it begins to fail structurally. As the alloy tends to be fairly consistent across most manufacturers, the maximum velocity of the piston at a given rpm is determined by the length of the stroke, that is, the radius of the journal of the crankshaft.The most common engine types in production are built to square, or below square. That is, a square engine has the same diameter of cylinder bore as the total length of the stroke from 0 to 180 degrees, whereas in an undersquare engine, the total length of the stroke is less than the diameter of the bore. The latter is mostly used in higher performance engines where the torque curve approaches the peak of the maximum piston velocity. Generally in this type of engine, the volume of the cylinder can be artificially enhanced with turbochargers or superchargers, increasing the amount of fuel/air available for combustion.An example is found in Formula 1 racing engines, where the cylinder diameter is substantially greater than the length of the stroke, resulting in higher available rpm but necessitating greater requirements of the strengths of connecting rods and pistons and higher temperature tolerances for bearings. The cylinder diameter in these engines are fairly small (under 45 mm) and the stroke is less than that, depending on the torque curve and maximum available rpm as designed by the builder. Peak torque is reached at higher rpm and is spread over a wider range of rpm. The specifications of these are known factors and can be designed to.Torque is a function of the length of the stroke, the shorter the stroke, the less available torque at lower rpm, but the piston velocity can be taken to much greater speeds, meaning higher engine rpm. These types of engines are much more delicate and require a much higher level of precision in the moving parts than square or oversquare engines. Up until the early 1960s, the focus by designers was on torque rather than piston velocity, probably due to material considerations and machining technologies. As materials have improved, engine rpm has increased.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The charge burn {{characteristics}} of a four-cylinder port-fuel-injected spark ignition engine fitted with a dual independent variable-valve-timing system have been investigated experimentally. The influence of valve timings on the flame development angle and the rapid burn angle is primarily associated with valve overlap values and internal gas recirculation. Conditions examined cover light to medium loads and engine speeds up to 3500 r/min. As engine loads and speeds exceeded about 6 bar net indicated mean effective pressure and 3000 r/min respectively, combustion duration was virtually independent of the valve timing setting. At lower speeds and work output conditions, valve timing influenced burn angles through changes in dilution mass fraction, charge density, and charge temperature. Of these, changes in dilution mass fraction had the greatest influence. Increasing the dilution by increasing the valve overlap produced an increase in both burn angles.

40|$|In {{order to}} measure {{in-cylinder}} flow of direct injection diesel engine accurately by laser doppler velocimeter (LDV) with frequency tracker, a new data acquisition technique was developed.

Velocity measurements in circumferential direction were made at the position apart from the inside of the cylinder head by 13 mm {{near the center of the}} cylinder. Test engine has a cylinder bore of 102 mm and a stoke of 106 mm. Mean velocity and velocity fluctuation were derived from statistical analysis of LDV data and the reliability was investigated by calculating the confidence interval. The experimental results are as follows. (1) Velocity distribution histogram within a crank angle interval of 5 degrees can be approximated to gaussian distribution. (2) Even if the number of sampling data varies with crank angle, mean velocity and velocity fluctuation can be acquired accurately during intake and compression stroke by obtaining 10000 velocity data in many engine cycles. Lack of data in a certain crank angle interval can be indicated in confidence interval distribution. (3) Velocity fluctuation is about a half of the maximum mean velocity in intake stroke. but in compression stroke it is low and varies little.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} the power-to-weight ratio, small, air-cooled utility engines are designed for WOT performance. Low-speed, light-load conditions suffer due to high residual gas retention, poor volumetric efficiency and an unfavorable in-cylinder flow field {{that can lead to}} heat release past EVO. Conditions with significant heat release past EVO have been found to contribute as a dominant HC emissions source at low-speed and lightload. The effects of a dual spark configuration, an alternate spark location, and bulk flow improvement through swirl enhancement were investigated on a single-cylinder, air-cooled utility engine. A steady flow analysis of various swirl enhancement techniques was conducted on a steady flow bench with a swirl adaptor to obtain a global view of the intake flow angular momentum. Through in-cylinder pressure recording and exhaust gas sampling, a single-zone heat release and ring-pack model were utilized to analyze combustion and emissions performance. A similar operating condition was defined and explored to determine the light-load performance of various engine designs to isolate characteristics leading to improved performance. It was found that a dual spark configuration advances combustion leading to a reduction in burn duration, but increased burning rate only occurs when the flame fronts are held independent. With a retarded combustion phasing strategy, HC and NOX emissions were reduced independent of speed and load due to lower ring pack loading and a favorable post-oxidation environment. Conditions with significant heat release past EVO through retarded combustion phasing were found to not increase HC emissions; an oxidation reaction was still in effect. A port blockage that induced a tangential flow was found to significantly improve the part-throttle steady flow swirl coefficient leading to a greater global swirl ratio. Engine combustion tests using this blockage indicated a significant advance of combustion leading to decreased burn duration and reduced COV independent of speed and load. Due to the improved burn rate, lean operating conditions were explored and resulted in a significant reduction in HC emissions, but increased NOX leading to a negligible change in the HC+NOX parameter from the rich condition.
