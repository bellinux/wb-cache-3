5|$|The Coatbridge accent {{has been}} {{categorised}} as <b>making</b> <b>less</b> {{use of the}} Scots tongue and exhibiting a tendency to stress the 'a' vowel differently from general Scots usage. Examples of this are seen the pronunciation of the words stair (sterr), hair (herr), fair (ferr) and chair (cherr). This different enunciation {{has been attributed to}} the impact of successive influxes of Ulster Catholic immigrants into Coatbridge. However, the distinctiveness of the Coatbridge accent and pronunciation has diminished as the various surrounding populations (especially Glasgow) have mingled with that of Coatbridge.|$|E

College graduates are 24.5%, people without a high school degree are 22.6%, and people with college experience without a bachelor's degree are 28.4%.

Households <b>making</b> <b>less</b> than $15,000 a year are 40.8%; although that is largely {{a function of the}} 27% of residents who are full-time college students.

25|$|The misery index, {{defined as}} the {{inflation}} rate added to the unemployment rate, shrank from 19.33 when he began his administration to 9.72 when he left, the greatest improvement record for a President since Harry S.

In terms of American households, the percentage of total households <b>making</b> <b>less</b> than $10,000 a year (in real 2007 dollars) shrank from 8.8% in 1980 to 8.3% in 1988 while the percentage of households making over $75,000 went from 20.2% to 25.7% during that period, both signs of progress.|$|E
25|$|Such {{collusion}} {{in other}} industries had been ruled to be restraint of trade {{in violation of}} the Sherman Antitrust Act. Players had two options to resist it and become free agents. They could ask to be released from their contracts (which they rarely were), or hold out and refuse to report until the year was up, forfeiting their pay in the process. While star players were able to exercise some leverage this way, most who held out were often traded to other teams and wound up <b>making</b> <b>less</b> money.|$|E

25|$|Jackson and Williams (1985) {{proposed}} {{that if someone}} feels that others in the group are slacking or that others will slack, he will lower his effort to match that of the others. This can occur whether {{it is apparent that}} the others are slacking or if someone simply believes that the group is slacking. For example, in the Latane et al. study above, if a participant heard the others <b>making</b> <b>less</b> noise than anticipated, he could have lowered his effort in an attempt to equal that of the others, rather than aiming for the optimum.|$|E
25|$|The recent {{moves away}} from {{intervention}} buying, subsidies for specific crops, reductions in export subsidies, have changed the situation somewhat. In the past years intervention has been reduced or abolished in all sectors. After two decades of significant CAP reforms, farmers can now respond to market signals and increase production {{to react to the}} higher prices. Although the new decoupled payments were aimed at environmental measures, many farmers have found that without these payments their businesses {{would not be able to}} survive. With food prices dropping over the past thirty years in real terms, many products have been <b>making</b> <b>less</b> than their cost of production when sold at the farm gate.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, President Barack Obama {{signed the}} Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This law {{extended}} {{the statute of}} limitations on cases where a worker found that they were receiving discriminatory pay, allowing them to sue and receive recompense more than six months after they received the pay. This was seen as a victory for those fighting against the gender wage gap, because if a woman {{at the end of her}} career found that she had been <b>making</b> <b>less</b> money than men who were doing the same work, she now had more than six months from the date of her last pay check to file a claim and possibly receive the wages that were denied.|$|E
40|$|The second goal of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the {{relationship}} between competition, innovation and productivity. As empirical evidence for this relationship is hardly available for the Netherlands, chapter 4 fills this gap by using Dutch (aggregate) firm level data. Chapter 5 examines the link between competition and product innovation at the firm level. It particularly analyzes the effect of product differentiation related to <b>making</b> products <b>less</b> close substitutes, and hence <b>making</b> markets <b>less</b> competitive. ...|$|R

25|$|Full {{retirement}} age spouses and divorced spouses (married over 10 years before divorce) {{are entitled to}} the higher of 50% of the wage earners benefits or their own earned benefits. A low salary worker and his full {{retirement age}} spouse <b>making</b> <b>less</b> {{than or equal to}} $791/month with 40 quarters of employment credit and at full retirement age (65 if born before 1938, 66 if born from 1938 to 1954 and 67 if born after 1960) could retire with 135% of his indexed average salary. A full retirement age worker and his full retirement age spouse making the ceiling income or more would be eligible for 43% of the ceiling FICA salary (29% if single) and even less if making more than the ceiling income.|$|E
25|$|Another {{concern is}} the rate of uninsured people in the US. In June 2014, Gallup–Healthways Well–Being {{conducted}} a survey {{and found that the}} uninsured rate is going down. 13 percent of U.S. adults are uninsured in 2014. This is a decrease from the percentage at 17 percent in January 2014 and translates to roughly 10 million to 11 million individuals who gained coverage. The survey also looked at the major demographic groups and found each is making progress towards getting health insurance. However, Hispanics, who have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group, are lagging in their progress. Under the new health care reform, Latinos were expected to be major beneficiaries of the new health care law. Gallup found that the biggest drop in the uninsured rate (3 percentage points) was among households <b>making</b> <b>less</b> than $36,000 a year.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 2002–03 season, Nabokov held out, refusing to sign San Jose's {{proposed}} contract. After <b>making</b> <b>less</b> than $1 million the previous two seasons, he felt he deserved an increase in salary, speculated to be around $4 million per season. He missed five games before the team signed him to a two-year contract worth slightly more than $3.5 million per season. Both Nabokov and the Sharks had a poor season, with the team missing the playoffs {{for the first time in}} six years, and Nabokov only winning 19 games, and finishing with a losing record. This was improved upon in 2003–04 though, as Nabokov's 31 wins helped the team reach the playoffs again, where they reached the third round for the first time in team history. A further two-year extension signed in 2004 saw him earn almost $4.5 million per year.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after Obama's 2012 re-election, Congressional Republicans and Obama again faced {{off over}} the final fate of the Bush tax cuts. Republicans sought to make all tax cuts permanent, while Obama sought to extend the tax cuts only for those making under $250,000. Obama and Congressional Republicans came to an {{agreement}} on the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which made permanent the tax cuts for individuals <b>making</b> <b>less</b> than $400,000 a year (or less than $450,000 for couples). For earnings greater than that amount, the income tax increased from 35% to 39.6%, which was the top rate before {{the passage of the}} Bush tax cuts. The deal also permanently indexed the alternative minimum tax for inflation, limited deductions for individuals making more than $250,000 ($300,000 for couples), permanently set the estate tax exemption at $5.12 million (indexed to inflation), and increased the top estate tax rate from 35% to 40%. Though many Republicans did not like the deal, the bill passed the Republican House in large part {{due to the fact that}} the failure to pass any bill would have resulted in the total expiration of the Bush tax cuts.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, 2011, Obama {{announced}} that he would seek re-election in the 2012 presidential election. Obama did not face any significant rivals for the 2012 Democratic nomination. Obama's Republican opponent in the general election, former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, advocated for lower taxes, spending cuts, an increase in defense spending, and a repeal of Obamacare (which was ironically based on a Massachusetts healthcare plan developed under Romney). Obama's campaign was based in Chicago and run by many former members of the White House staff and members of the successful 2008 campaign. Obama won re-election with 332 (out of a total of 538) electoral votes and 51.1% of the popular vote, making him the first person since Dwight Eisenhower to twice win 51 percent of the vote. According to exit polls, Obama won a majority of the vote from women, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, people under 45, people <b>making</b> <b>less</b> than $50,000 per year, people inhabiting large or mid-sized cities, liberals, moderates, the unmarried, gays, and people with no college education, some college education, or graduate degrees. In addition to the presidential election victory, the Democrats also picked up seats in both houses of Congress, but Republicans retained control of the House.|$|E
25|$|President Reagan's tenure {{marked a}} time of {{expanded}} economic prosperity for many Americans. The misery index sank to 9.72 {{from a high of}} 19.33, the greatest improvement record for a President since Harry S. Truman left office. In terms of American households, the percentage of total households <b>making</b> <b>less</b> than $10,000 a year (in real 2007 dollars) shrunk from 8.8% in 1980 to 8.3% in 1988 while the percentage of households making over $75,000 went from 20.2% to 25.7% during that period. However, the number of Americans below the poverty level did not decline at all. The number of children, ages 18 years and younger, below the poverty level increased from 11.543 million in 1980, 18.3% of children, to 12.455, 19.5%, in 1988. Also, the situation of low income groups was affected by the reduction of social spending, and inequality increased. The share of total income received by the 5% highest-income households grew from 16.5% in 1980 to 18.3% in 1988 and the share of the highest fifth of income increased from 44.1% to 46.3% in same years. In contrast, the share of total income of the lowest fifth of households fell from 4.2% in 1980 to 3.8% in 1988 and the second poorest fifth from 10.2% to 9.6%.|$|E

During his term as governor, he was successful in having Utah replace its progressive income tax with a top rate of 7%, with a flat tax of 5%; cut the statewide sales tax rate from 4.75% to 4.65% and sales tax on unprepared food from 4.70% to 1.75%; and raise motor vehicle registration fees. He proposed a 400% increase in cigarette taxes, but the measure was never signed into law. In 2008, he successively proposed tax credits for families purchasing their own health insurance, as well as income tax credits for capital gains and solar projects.|$|E
500|$|Later in February, Specter accused Sestak of mistreating his {{employees}} and disobeying {{state and federal}} minimum wage laws by severely underpaying his House staff. Citing Federal Election Commission reports, Specter claimed ten of Sestak's sixteen campaign staffers were <b>making</b> <b>less</b> than minimum wage {{and that they were}} so underpaid they were eligible for food stamps. He also noted that Sestak's three highest-paid staffers were members of his family, including his brother Richard Sestak, who worked as campaign manager. T.J. Rooney, a Specter supporter, wrote a letter to Sestak expressing concern about the potential violation of minimum wage laws, which read: [...] "It is inconceivable to me that our standard bearer wouldn’t be paying his workers the minimum wage". Sestak responded by acknowledging his staff could make more money elsewhere, but said [...] "they choose to work hard and make some sacrifices because they know {{how important it is to}} elect someone to the United States Senate who shares their principles".|$|E
