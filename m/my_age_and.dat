5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man of <b>my</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E
25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people <b>my</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E
25|$|In an oral history, Lopez-De La Cruz remembered some {{circumstances}} {{of being a}} female labor organizer. “It was very hard being a woman organizer. Many of our people <b>my</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> older were raised with the old customs where the husband rules and the wife obeys… Neighbors in Parlier were for the union, {{but they were not}} taking orders from women.” She suggested reforms to make the union more inclusive to women, for example her “suggestion” to add women to the all male ranch committee of Christian Brothers Wine Company, and her push to end a ban on women pruning, making higher paying work available to women’s crews at the Christian Brothers Wine Company. She also remembered how women took the lead in volunteering for store front picket lines and engaging customers in conversations about the struggle. Aside from being an efficient and passionate organizer, Lopez-De La Cruz is remembered for her incredible wit. Many stories have survived of her ability to invoke humor and justice in situations. For example, after being red bated at a picket line at a Fresno Safeway in the mid 1960s and being asked by a white man “how do you say communists in Spanish?”, she responded “Ustedes Ganaran” (You shall win), and the man went on to passionately shout the phrase while UFW members looked on and laughed.|$|E

500|$|While {{playing the}} {{juvenile}} lead in Bird in Hand at the Royalty Theatre in June 1928, Olivier began {{a relationship with}} Jill Esmond, {{the daughter of the}} actors Henry V. Esmond and Eva Moore. Olivier later recounted that he thought [...] "she would most certainly do excellent well for a wife...

500|$|In 1983, on her {{way back}} from Paris, Steinberg began dancing in the studio of Moses Pendleton, who had founded the modern dance company Pilobolus. She had been {{attracted}} to Pilobolus growing up: [...] "I was taller than most girls <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> I thought that was a company I could be with because the women were always lifting the men." [...] There she joined up with Daniel Ezralow, Jamey Hampton, and Ashley Roland, and the four created the Connecticut-based, dancer-illusionist company MOMIX. From 1983 to 1986, Steinberg toured nationally with MOMIX. The group became known for their visual humour, contorted positions, and Trompe-l'œil effects.|$|E

500|$|We {{disliked the}} English {{language}} in the past. I disliked it because I was forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to learn it because of <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> perhaps I would not be willing to do it because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in any way by flogging their idea of [...] "Hindi Imperialism" [...] to the maximum extent possible. So, it is up to my friends in Uttar Pradesh to have a whole India; it is up to them to have a Hindi-India. The choice is theirs.|$|E
500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, <b>my</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> things. I think I got to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E
500|$|The next {{task was}} to remove and replace the telescope's Science Instrument Command and Data Handling Unit, or SIC, a {{computer}} that sends commands to Hubble's science instruments, and formats science data for transmission to the ground. This was the item that failed in September 2008, delaying STS-125 while engineers prepared a replacement part for the mission, and the crew trained for the new task. While {{the failure of the}} SIC did not disable the telescope, replacing the unit restores the redundancies. The final major {{task was to}} install the Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM), which includes the [...] Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) that will allow spacecraft in the future to dock with the telescope, and to safely de-orbit the telescope {{at the end of its}} life. Feustel also installed two of four Latch Over Center Kits, or LOCKs, that make opening and closing Hubble's large access doors easier for the remaining spacewalks. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:12 UTC, for a time of seven hours and twenty minutes. It was the nineteenth spacewalk devoted to servicing the telescope, and brought the total time in servicing Hubble to one hundred thirty-six hours, thirty minutes. Due to the length of the spacewalk, and the delay in beginning, the crew was over an hour behind their scheduled timeline for the day, but worked through the post-EVA activities and evening activities without problems, and got to sleep only slightly behind their scheduled time. During the mission status briefing, David Leckrone, Hubble Project Senior Scientist, noted he was very relieved that the camera was replaced successfully, and noted that the problems with the bolt caused some concern, [...] "I don't normally reveal <b>my</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> I'm not going to here, but I can tell you I'm five years older now than I was when I came to work this morning, we can sleep pretty well tonight, knowing that's been accomplished." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{negotiations}} with the Soviet Union failed in 1939, Mannerheim withdrew his resignation on 17 October. At age 72, he became commander-in-chief of the Finnish armed forces after the Soviet attack on 30 November. In {{a letter to his}} daughter Sophie, he stated, [...] "I had not wanted to undertake the responsibility of commander-in-chief, as <b>my</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> my health entitled me, but I had to yield to appeals from the President of the Republic and the government, and now for the fourth time I am at war." ...|$|E

2500|$|Christina Aguilera was {{recorded}} between 1998 and 1999, with Ron Fair {{serving as the}} album's executive producer. The label reportedly spent $1 million on writers, producers and voice lessons. According to Fair, [...] "She {{was very much a}} raw talent, so building a collection of songs that would become her first album was a time-consuming process. We wanted to find the ones that could knock the door down and put her up there." [...] The album was built around pop songs, which was against Aguilera's will, since she wanted a more R album. She further explained during an interview for The Washington Post: [...] "I was held back a lot from doing more R ad-libbing. They clearly wanted to make a fresh-sounding young pop record and that's not always the direction I wanted to go in. Sometimes they didn't get it, didn't want to hear me out because of <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> that was a little bit frustrating. Since all the success, it's a little easier to get my opinions across." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keaton's {{first major}} hit since 1996 came in 2003's Something's Gotta Give, {{directed}} by Nancy Meyers and co-starring Jack Nicholson. Nicholson and Keaton, aged 66 and 57 respectively, {{were seen as}} bold casting choices for leads in a romantic comedy. Twentieth Century Fox, the film's original studio, reportedly declined to produce the film, fearing that the lead characters were {{too old to be}} bankable. Keaton commented about the situation in Ladies' Home Journal: [...] "Let's face it, people <b>my</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> Jack's age are much deeper, much more soulful, because they've seen a lot of life. They {{have a great deal of}} passion and hope—why shouldn't they fall in love? Why shouldn't movies show that?" [...] Keaton played a middle-aged playwright who falls in love with her daughter's much older boyfriend. The film was a major success at the box office, grossing US$125million in North America. Roger Ebert wrote that [...] "Nicholson and Keaton bring so much experience, knowledge and humor to their characters that the film works in ways the screenplay might not have even hoped for." [...] The following year, Keaton received her fourth Academy Award nomination for her role in the film.|$|E
2500|$|Tendulkar's {{allegations}} {{were supported by}} former teammates such as Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and V. V. S. Laxman. Zaheer called Chappell a [...] "control freak" [...] and said, [...] "After he was appointed {{the coach of the}} Indian team, he once came upto me and told [...] "Zaheer, you will not be playing for India till I remain the coach". He also added that the two-year term under Chappell was [...] "easily the worst and darkest phase" [...] that he could remember. Harbhajan said, [...] "Chappell destroyed Indian cricket {{to such an extent that}} it required at least 3 years to again get back on track. The worst part was some players in that team, who sucked upto the coach and would supply selective misinformation creating bigger rifts". He also talked about the email leak, [...] "Sourav was batting out there in the middle and this man was typing a critical e-mail against Sourav, sitting right there in that dressing room. He had no interest in the proceedings of the match. There were seven guys that he wanted to get rid of. Sourav was his primary target followed by myself, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh". Laxman was also critical of Chappell in saying that Chappell took Indian cricket [...] "backwards" [...] during his coaching tenure. Laxman also recalled an incident from 2006, [...] "This happened in 2006 at the Wankhede Stadium when India played versus England. Yuvraj Singh was picked ahead of me. We were going to the West Indies for a four-Test series after that and he asked me if I would open. I mentioned in 2000 I had decided I would not open anymore after it didn't work for me in the first four years. I was consistent in the middle order since 2000. Chappell asked me <b>my</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> said - Don't you think 31 is too young an age to sit at home? I was astonished to hear this. I had a very good run under him. I was the second highest run scorer under him." ...|$|E
