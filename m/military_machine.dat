5|$|According to Historian Alexander Mikaberidze, the French Army {{remained}} the finest army of its day {{by a good}} margin. It had been {{the legacy of the}} French King and its fusion with the formations of the French revolution and Napoleon's reforms had transformed it into a <b>military</b> <b>machine</b> that had dominated Europe since 1805. Each corps of the French Army was in fact its own mini-army capable of independent action.|$|E
5|$|The Tupolev Tu-75 was a {{military}} transport variant of the Tu-4 bomber, as was a similar airliner, the Tu-70, both using a new, purpose-designed fuselage. The first Soviet <b>military</b> <b>machine</b> of this class, it was equipped with a rear fuselage loading ramp. It was not placed into production because the VVS {{decided it would be}} cheaper to modify its existing Tu-4s for the transport mission and to use its existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin Il-12 transports.|$|E
5|$|To sustain this <b>military</b> <b>machine</b> {{and meet}} other state expenses, {{large amounts of}} revenue were necessary. Greater Poland had some natural {{resources}} used for trade, such as fur, hide, honey and wax, but those surely did not provide enough income. According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, Prague in Bohemia, a city built of stone, was the main center for the exchange of trading commodities {{in this part of}} Europe. From Kraków, the Slavic traders brought tin, salt, amber and whatever other products they had, most importantly slaves; Muslim, Jewish, Hungarian and other traders were the buyers. The Life of St. Adalbert, written {{at the end of the}} 10th century by John Canaparius, records the fate of many Christian slaves sold in Prague as the main curse of the time. Dragging of shackled slaves is shown as a scene in the bronze 12th-century Gniezno Doors. It may well be that the territorial expansion financed itself by being the source of loot, of which the captured local people were the most valuable part. The scale of the human trade practice is arguable, however, because much of the population from the defeated tribes was resettled for agricultural work or in the near-gord settlements, where they could serve the victors in various capacities and thus contribute to the economic and demographic potential of the state. Considerable increase of population density was characteristic of the newly established states in eastern and central Europe. The slave trade not insufficient to meet all revenue needs, the Piast state had to look for other options.|$|E

25|$|Lastly, the Mali Empire, {{like its}} Songhai competitor, {{had failed to}} {{modernize}} its <b>military</b> <b>machine.</b> This was not for lack of trying, however. Previous mansas had {{tried in vain to}} purchase firearms or firearm-equipped mercenaries from the Portuguese to no avail. The Mali Empire went to war with the same methods it had been using since the days of Sundjata but without the unity or scale of its past armies.|$|E
25|$|During {{his reign}} the Marwari horse was introduced, {{becoming}} Shah Jahan's favourite, and various Mughal cannons were mass-produced in the Jaigarh Fort. Under his rule, the empire became a huge <b>military</b> <b>machine</b> and the nobles and their contingents multiplied almost fourfold, {{as did the}} demands for more revenue from the peasantry. But due to his measures in the financial and commercial fields, it {{was a period of}} general stability—the administration was centralised and court affairs systematised.|$|E

25|$|He {{is often}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest military commanders of all time, with innovative use of combined arms. His most notable military victory was the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631). With a superb <b>military</b> <b>machine,</b> good weapons, excellent training, and effective field artillery, backed by an efficient government that could provide necessary funds, Gustavus Adolphus was poised to make himself a major European leader. He was killed a year later, however, at the Battle of Lützen (1632). He was ably assisted in his efforts by Count Axel Oxenstierna, the Lord High Chancellor of Sweden, who also acted as regent after his death.|$|E

The post of commander-in-chief was abolished, and Trotsky gained full control of the Red Army, responsible only to the Communist Party leadership, whose Left Socialist Revolutionary allies had left the government over Brest-Litovsk. With the help of his deputy Ephraim Sklyansky, Trotsky {{spent the rest of the}} Civil War transforming the Red Army from a ragtag network of small and fiercely independent detachments into a large and disciplined <b>military</b> <b>machine,</b> through forced conscription, party-controlled blocking squads, compulsory obedience and officers chosen by the leadership instead of the rank and file. He defended these positions throughout his life.|$|E

25|$|The Janissary corps were {{distinctive}} in {{a number}} of ways. They wore unique uniforms, were paid regular salaries (including bonuses) for their service, marched to music (the mehter), lived in barracks and were the first corps to make extensive use of firearms. A Janissary battalion was a close-knit community, effectively the soldier's family. By tradition, the Sultan himself, after authorizing the payments to the Janissaries, visited the barracks dressed as a janissary trooper, and received his pay alongside the other men of the First Division. They also served as policemen, palace guards, and fire fighters during peacetime. The Janissaries also enjoyed far better support on campaign than other armies of the time. They were part of a well-organized <b>military</b> <b>machine,</b> in which one support corps prepared the roads while others pitched tents and baked the bread. Their weapons and ammunition were transported and re-supplied by the cebeci corps. They campaigned with their own medical teams of Muslim and Jewish surgeons and their sick and wounded were evacuated to dedicated mobile hospitals set up behind the lines.|$|E
500|$|The central premise {{behind the}} story of [...] "The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor" [...] was to {{showcase}} both the true danger posed by the Flood and {{the inner workings of}} the Covenant <b>military</b> <b>machine,</b> to dispel the image that the Covenant [...] "simply stand around waiting for the Chief to blast them". The story was written by Lee Hammock with art provided by Simon Bisley. Hammock described the process of writing the story as a [...] "heady task" [...] since he had to respect Halo fans' knowledge of the characters and canon, ensuring that [...] "characters that [...] know as a part of themselves are portrayed aptly". These difficulties were mitigated by the knowledge that fans were not as intimately connected to the history of the character of Rtas as they were to the likes of the Master Chief; this allowed ample room to expand 'Vadumee's background in sync with the Halo canon while permitting the writer to [...] "bring something new to the table".|$|E

2500|$|In 1972 {{there was}} {{distinct}} {{weaknesses in the}} coordination of armor, artillery and infantry, with the three fronts of advance failing to support one another satisfactorily. Armored forces were often committed in penny packets, with lack of effective infantry support and artillery co-operation, making them vulnerable to US and ARVN countermeasures. The logistics system was also unable to support the [...] of full-scale conventional battle. By 1975, these weaknesses had been substantially corrected, and a sophisticated <b>military</b> <b>machine</b> attained a rapid victory. The Ho Chi Minh Trail was increasingly a network of paved roads easing the logistical flow for the Offensive and tactical concentration and coordination of infantry, armor and artillery was much tighter.|$|E
2500|$|The Ottoman armies were {{distinguished}} from their contemporaries in the West not by numerical predominance {{of its military}} forces but by the thoroughness of the administrative backup and general support that maintained them in the field.
