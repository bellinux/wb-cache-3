5|$|Lexie takes {{part in a}} {{surgery on}} a patient named Alison Clark (Caroline Williams) and informs her husband Gary Clark (Michael O'Neill) {{that it was a}} success. However, moments later Alison suffers a stroke and falls into a coma that she is deemed {{unlikely}} to wake from. As Alison had signed a DNR form, Lexie is forced to turn off the machine keeping her alive, despite Gary begging her to stop. After failing in an attempt to sue the hospital, a grief-stricken <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clark</b> later returns to the hospital with a gun, seeking revenge on Lexie, Derek and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). After witnessing <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clark</b> shoot a nurse dead, Mark shields Lexie during the shooting and the pair attempt to save a critically wounded Alex. Seeking supplies, Lexie heads out into the hospital and comes face to face with <b>Mr</b> <b>Clark</b> who attempts to shoot her, but she is saved by a SWAT team member who wounds Clark at the last moment allowing her to escape. Lexie and Mark proceed to save Alex's life, but Lexie is disappointed and irritated when a delirious Alex calls for his ex-wife, Izzie, while nearly dying instead of Lexie. After a showdown with Richard, Gary Clark eventually commits suicide, having killed eleven people and wounding another seven, as well as causing Meredith to suffer a miscarriage.|$|E
5|$|Sporadic privately {{operated}} ferry services between Adolphustown and Stone Mills (Glenora) {{were initially}} a primitive affair. In October 1835 a <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clark</b> from Cobourg tipped {{out of the}} bark canoe ferrying him to Glenora and was buried without an inquest; a year earlier, a Rev. Mathew Miller from Cobourg had drowned after falling through the February ice. The road itself was no better, barely adequate for horse and rider but unfit to run stagecoach lines.|$|E

25|$|Fields Mill on Broom Hill burnt down in 1875. In Dickens' {{times the}} Miller was a <b>Mr</b> <b>Clark,</b> but {{the owner was}} Mr Field. Mr Field was an amateur musician, who kept a piano, a harp and a barrel organ in his sitting room. It is said that the organ was bought from Loose Church, and so fixed that the power from the mill turned the organ's handle. Dickens would visit the mill on his walks, {{and listen to the}} organ music.|$|E

Ernst Harth as Burly Man, David-Paul Grove as Doc, and Gabe Khouth as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clark.</b> The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Public curiosity over Clark's {{condition}} and {{his return to}} television helped Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 2006 draw in over 20 million viewers throughout the night, and score a 7.1 audience share among the key demographic of 18- to 49-year-olds. Reaction to Clark's appearance was mixed. While some TV critics (including Tom Shales of The Washington Post, {{in an interview with}} the CBS Radio Network) felt he was not in good enough shape to do the broadcast, stroke survivors and many of Clark's fans praised the emcee for being a role model for people dealing with post-stroke recovery. The New York Times Brian Stelter compared Seacrest's new role as co-host of Rockin' Eve to being like a [...] "traffic cop", [...] "tossing to bands and correspondents and to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clark</b> for the countdown." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2005, {{after an}} {{internal}} investigation by an independent counsel appointed by Fox, which included interviews with Abdul, Clark and other witnesses, the investigators concluded that Clark’s claims of a sexual relationship “have not been substantiated by any corroborating evidence or witnesses, including those provided by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clark,</b> and Ms. Abdul expressly denies that any such relationship ever existed." [...] The investigators further added that [...] "Ms. Abdul acknowledges that she had telephone conversations with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clark</b> {{while he was a}} contestant. Their accounts of those conversations, however, differ greatly and no evidence was uncovered to resolve the conflicts in their accounts." [...] The network announced that Abdul could continue her judging duties on future seasons of American Idol, adding, [...] "The line is whether it affects the outcome of the competition....It is the sanctity of the competition that is first and foremost." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "In another case, {{there was}} a very sick woman... Notwithstanding the {{critical}} condition of the woman, he [...] had the roof taken down to a small bit over the woman's bed."

2500|$|At {{the height}} of the débâcle, Abdul {{appeared}} in a Saturday Night Live skit, making light of the situation. While Fox launched an investigation, Abdul received numerous calls of support from celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey and Kelly Ripa; Barbara Walters addressed the camera during an episode of ABC's The View to say she was sad to be part of an operation that would report Clark's flimsy tabloid claims under the guise of a news story. In August 2005, the Fox network confirmed that she would be returning to the show, as the investigation had found [...] "insufficient evidence that the communications between <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clark</b> and Ms. Abdul in any way aided his performance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Corey Clark {{was also}} disqualified {{from the show}} because, {{according}} to the Idol producers, Clark had a police record he had not disclosed to the show. [...] However, in 2005, contestant Corey Clark alleged {{in an interview on}} ABC's Primetime Live and in a book, They Told Me to Tell the Truth, So... The Sex, Lies and Paulatics of One of America's Idols, that he and judge Paula Abdul had an affair while he was on the show and that this contributed to his removal. Clark also alleged that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show and tips on song choice. [...] A subsequent investigation by an independent counsel hired by Fox [...] "could not corroborate the evidence or allegations provided by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clark</b> or any witnesses". [...] Paula Abdul was therefore considered exonerated but an [...] "enhanced non-fraternization policy" [...] was put in place after the investigation.|$|E

60|$|I found <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clark</b> in his counting-room, and I had {{not talked}} with him five minutes before I began to suspect that, if a treasonable {{understanding}} existed between Wilkinson and the Spanish government, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clark</b> was innocent of it. He being the only prominent American in the place, it was natural that Wilkinson should have formed with him a business arrangement {{to care for the}} cargoes he sent down. Indeed, after we had sat for some time chatting together, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clark</b> began himself to make guarded inquiries on this very subject. Did I know Wilkinson? How was his enterprise of selling Kentucky products regarded at home? But I do not intend to burden this story with accounts of a matter which, though it has never been wholly clear, has been long since fairly settled in the public mind. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clark</b> was most amiable, accepted my statement that I was travelling for pleasure, and honored Monsieur Chouteau's bon (for my purchase of the miniature had deprived me of nearly all my ready money), and said that Mr. Temple and I would need horses to get to Les Iles.|$|E
5000|$|On 26 July 2012, BBC News {{reported}} Keith Vaz, {{chairman of}} the Home Affairs Committee, as saying in hindsight that <b>Mr</b> <b>Clark's</b> departure had been [...] "totally unnecessary" [...] and had happened because [...] "everyone panicked".
