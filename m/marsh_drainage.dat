50|$|The {{study group}} wrote six treatises in the {{following}} year: four of them were published and quickly became regarded as masterpieces among that part of natural philosophy dedicated {{to the study of}} earthquakes, their reputation lasting through the following two centuries. The essays were essential in disproving emerging theories that blamed the earthquake on the drainage of the many Duchy's swamps and their reclamation as fertile agricultural lands. One of the leading theories at the time was that earthquakes were caused by subterranean winds, excited by change in temperature. The winds should have escaped through the <b>marshes,</b> but <b>drainage</b> compromised the process so the winds grew in pressure and caused shocks.|$|R

40|$|In this study, I examine channel form in {{restored}} and natural tidal marshes {{to understand how}} marshes evolve from salt ponds and agricultural fi elds to naturally functioning tidal marshes. I examined the channel morphology of two marshes {{near the mouth of}} the Napa River in Solano County, California ‚Äì one natural marsh approximately 100 years old (‚Äúcentennial marsh‚Äù) and one restored in 1995 ‚Äì using mapping techniques in ArcView GIS. I followed the techniques of a previous analysis done by Phil Williams and Associates (PWA) in 2003 on four other {{restored and}} natural marshes in the North San Francisco Bay and examined channel sinuosity, bifurcation ratios, length ratios, and drainage density (Garrity 2003). By combining my results with the results of the other four marshes, I have found that the data no longer fully conforms with the trends found by PWA. Both studies found that bifurcation ratios and length ratios of fi rst order channels tend to be larger for younger marshes. However, the contribution of my data shows that PWA‚Äôs observation that drainage density decreases with age is not entirely true. Instead, with the addition of data from the Napa centennial <b>marsh,</b> <b>drainage</b> density conforms more closely with the fi ndings of Steel and Pye (1997) that indicated drainage density increases with age up until about 150 years old and then decreases. Combining all of the data reveals that sinuosity tends to increase for 2 nd order channels with the age of the marsh...|$|E
40|$|The USFWS and Stantec are {{investigating}} the restoration or enhancement of {{a portion of the}} Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge north of Chiloquin OR. The conceptual design of the wetland and riverine habitat restoration is a complex project with a variety of very unique parameters. The land form of the Klamath marsh was primarily formed by the eruption of Crater Lake‚Äôs Mount Mazama. The Euro-American agricultural period drained much of the Marsh and created a series of drainage and irrigation channels with structures that inhibit fish passage. The <b>marsh</b> <b>drainage</b> that has occurred during the agricultural period has also limited the beneficial habitat for many wildlife species, including the prelisted Oregon Spotted Frog. The project goals and objects are numerous and include restoring the natural hydrology of the marsh. Other goals are related to fisheries, wildlife and achieving the optimal land use. It is important for the USFWS to be able to balance many conflicting goals and objectives to gain a consensus with the project stakeholders. The design team has been working with the USFWS to identify valley and streams of reference sections of the Williamson River to serve as and design surrogate to enhance the hydrology and habitat of the marsh. The project location is located in a transition of valley types and varies between losing and gaining stream reaches. A landscape based approach as evaluated concept designs for both a single threaded design reach of the Williamson River as well as an anastomosing River reach. Alternative approaches have been evaluated to accomplish the fish passage goals {{as well as the other}} project goals and objectives.
