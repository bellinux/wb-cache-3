The upper and old layers of shell do not here scale off so readily as {{in many of the}} foregoing species; and hence an unusually large proportional length of each valve projects freely above the sack; and the valves are of unusual thickness. The capitulum is very nearly as wide at its summit as at its base, owing to the divergence of the apices of the valves. The scuta and terga are articulated together by a conspicuous fold, which, when seen from vertically above, (Pl. IX, fig. 1 a´,) appears like a deep wedge-formed notch in the terga. On the exterior surfaces of the valves, the teeth on the successive rims are approximate; on the inner surfaces, the rims are covered by strong yellow membrane, which is generally fringed with small horny spines.|$|E

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Pilot valves are {{considered}} as one of most common types of valves in the industry today. They are widely-used because their design is simple, they are available in wide range of number of ports, they have high efficiency and smooth flow rate, and {{they are easy to}} operate and maintained. They are used in many applications like aircraft flight control, machinery, and automobiles etc. In this thesis, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been implemented practically to estimate the spool displacement of the <b>main</b> <b>valve</b> in a hydraulic system. The system includes a supply pressure feeding a three-way pilot valve, which controls a four-way <b>main</b> <b>valve.</b> Based on the mathematical equations, Matlab/Simulink models of the pilot valve and system components were made to compare with experimental data and used in EKF. Extended Kalman filter algorithm has employed to estimate the displacement of the <b>main</b> <b>valve</b> in presence of random noise and distortions again taking into account the noise measurement.

Interlocks are rarely used for upper, unmanned stages where failure of the interlock would cause loss of mission, but are present on the SSME, to shut the engines down prior to liftoff of the Space Shuttle. In addition, detection of successful ignition of the igniter is surprisingly difficult, some systems use thin wires that are cut by the flames, pressure sensors have also seen some use.|$|E

A second valve, after a delay, engaged the turbopump clutch. HP cocks were opened by a single hydraulic piston, driven by fuel pressure controlled through a third timed valve. Both fuel and oxidiser first flowed through a small pilot valve for ignition, before their <b>main</b> <b>valves</b> opened. Correct opening of all four valves was monitored by the timer control, to ensure a safe mixture.|$|E

40|$|Hydro {{power plants}} are {{operated}} {{in a different}} manner than {{what they used to}} be, due to increased focus on economy, and less on operating on best efficiency point. This creates new challenges related to wear and tear of the plant. In order to maintain and avoid degradation, the need for control is increased. Installing sensors in a hydro power plant may be difficult, and modeling and estimating parameters could be a solution. This thesis will cover real time modeling of flow systems, with particular focus on the Kalman filter. The filter {{is an important part of}} control engineering, but the utilization in hydro power seems to be limited. The goal of this thesis is to understand how the Kalman filter works for hydro power applications, and how it can be implemented in LabVIEW. The Kalman filter investigated is the nonlinear Discrete Extended Kalman filter. The case chosen is the estimation of flow, based on two different pressure losses. The Kalman filter program was run at different operating points in order to investigate the filters function on the dynamics of the system. The experimental rig used was the existing Swirl rig at the Water Power lab at NTNU. Some modifications had to be made in order for the rig to fit the experiment specifications. One of the <b>main</b> <b>valves</b> were changed, and some extra pressure outlets were made. Both flowmeters, absolute pressure transducers and differential pressure transducers were used for the experiment, all of these calibrated by the calibration program presented. The calibration includes uncertainty analysis. Both the calibration program and the Kalman filter program is presented step by step in order to describe the features and logic behind the programming. The main part of the results seemed to coincide with the Kalman filter theory. The estimations of the flow based on pressure loss over the valve seemed to follow the measured values, but the estimations for the pressure loss over the swirl generator did not. Some of the estimations showed reduction in loss compared to the measurements. These and more results are presented and discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Project Morpheus {{liquid oxygen}} (LOX) / liquid methane rocket engines {{demonstrated}} acousticcoupled combustion instabilities during sealevel groundbased testing at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) and Stennis Space Center (SSC). Highamplitude, 1 T, 1 R, 1 T 1 R (and higher order) modes {{appear to be}} triggered by injector conditions. The instability occurred during the Morpheusspecific engine ignition/start sequence, and did demonstrate the capability to propagate into mainstage. However, the instability was never observed to initiate during mainstage, even at low power levels. The Morpheus main engine is a JSCdesigned ~ 5, 000 lbfthrust, 4 : 1 throttling, pressurefed cryogenic engine using an impinging element injector design. Two different engine designs, named HD 4 and HD 5, and two different builds of the HD 4 engine all demonstrated similar instability characteristics. Through the analysis of more than 200 hot fire tests on the Morpheus vehicle and SSC test stand, a relationship between ignition stability and injector/chamber pressure was developed. The instability has the distinct characteristic of initiating at high relative injection pressure drop (dP) at low chamber pressure (Pc); i. e., instabilities initiated at high dP/Pc at low Pc during the start sequence. The high dP/Pc during start results during the injector /chamber chillin, and is enhanced by hydraulic flip in the injector orifice elements. Because of the fixed mixture ratio of the existing engine design (the <b>main</b> <b>valves</b> share a common actuator), it is not currently possible to determine if LOX or methane injector dP/Pc were individual contributors (i. e., LOX and methane dP/Pc typically trend {{in the same direction}} within a given test). The instability demonstrated initiation characteristic of starting at or shortly after methane injector chillin. Colder methane (e. g., subcooled) at the injector inlet prior to engine start was much more likely to result in an instability. A secondary effect of LOX subcooling was also possibly observed; greater LOX sub cooling improved stability. Some tests demonstrated a lowamplitude 1 L 1 T instability prior to LOX injector chillin. The Morpheus main engine also demonstrated chug instabilities during some engine shutdown sequences on the flight vehicle and SSC test stand. The chug instability was also infrequently observed during the startup sequence. The chug instabilities predictably initiated at low dP/Pc at low Pc. The chug instabilities were always selflimiting; startup chug instabilities terminated during throttleup and shutdown chug instabilities decayed by shutdown termination...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{hydraulic}} low pressure winch {{system has been}} modeled using bond graph theory. The hydraulic winch system {{is assumed to be}} installed on an offshore vessel affected by environmental forces and disturbances such as waves and currents. The hydraulic system powering the winch consists mainly of two pilot operated 3 / 3 -directional valves controlled by two 4 / 3 -directional valves and a hydraulic motor. The system also includes a pressure relief valve, check valves, pump systems, piping and filters. The 3 / 3 -directional valves are the main focus in the model and are therefore modeled with less simplifications compared to the other subsystems. A thorough model study has been initiated to figure out the model limitations, sensitivity of model parameters and the ability to simplify the derived model without loosing essential dynamics and characteristics. The effects of variable bulk modulus and fluid inertia in the 3 / 3 -directional valves have been studied by comparing different step responses and motor load characteristics. The observations and results from this model analysis laid the groundwork for control of the hydraulic motor. A clear relation between the main valve displacements and the motor velocity and torque in 4 / 3 valve configuration gave reasons to believe that manual motor control done by the winch operator through control of the valve displacements was possible. Adaptive PID controllers were used as inner controllers to control the control slides in the <b>main</b> <b>valves.</b> These controllers were later on replaced with PD-controllers when outer control was derived because the adaptive controllers tended to be a bit slow. Simplified state equations describing the motor dynamics were derived for control design purposes. The state equations extracted from the bond graph model showed high complexity, containing logic and discrete quantities, and were not suitable for control design. Model based speed- and torque controllers, based on sliding mode and backstepping control theory, were derived based on the simplified equations and implemented in the model. Different load cases were initiated to test the two controllers. A lumped wire-load model containing hydrodynamics, wire- and reel dynamics and environmental disturbances such as current and heave motions of the vessel were added in the total winch model to test the controllers in different operations with varying conditions and environments. The results from these controller tests gave reason to believe that a combination of these two controllers would be favourable in certain operations and would give increased safety in extreme cases such as stuck load and loss of load. The derived speed and torque controller were put into a hybrid controller framework and a switching algorithm was designed with focus on switching stability and wanted functionalities for the winch system. It was observed that switching stability and winch functionality were closely connected and different winch operations were essential {{in the design of the}} switching algorithm. Dwell time and tracking error switching were used as the main controller switching restrictions together with functionality based switching conditions. Different simulations were initiated to test the hybrid controller such as stuck load, loss of load and landing of a load at the sea floor. A Luenberger observer was derived to estimate the motor load and the motor velocity by using the simplified state equations and the differential pressure across the hydraulic motor as measurement in order to ensure redundancy in the control system and be able to control the hydraulic winch even though the decoder measuring the hydraulic motor velocity fails. </p...|$|E
