To perform live VM <b>migrations,</b> usage <b>statistics</b> collected by servers are evaluated and the servers that may be offloaded are selected. VMs that belong to the servers that may be offloaded are scattered to other active servers provided that the user-perceived performance is sustained. Overall, jobs submitted by users should be consolidated to as few servers as possible and the servers that host no job can be put in stand-by or hibernate mode, thus achieving an overall power reduction. Data Center management authorities may take advantage of such a monitoring entity in order to decrease energy consumption attributed to computing, storage and networking elements of data centers...|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is thus two-fold: 1) to provide a {{descriptive}} overview of how the mobility patterns of men and women have changed over time, and 2) to provide exploratory analysis of the factors that influence particular <b>migration</b> patterns. Descriptive <b>statistics</b> and bivariate means comparison tests (t-tests and analysis of variance tests) are used to explore how specific characteristics of the mobility experiences of men and women differ (or do not). Given the limited data available on the post-Soviet mobility patterns of both men and women, and particularly since 2008, this tactic contributes to a significant knowledge gap by mapping the major contours of migration movements.|$|R

As part of its planned Migration Program, the federal government allocates places each year for people wanting to migrate permanently to Australia. The 2010 – 11 Migration Program, announced on 11 May 2010, allocates a total of 168 700 places, made up of 113 850 places in the skill stream, 54 550 places in the family stream and 300 special eligibility places. Australia’s immigration policies have evolved from focussing on attracting migrants for the purpose of increasing Australia’s population to attracting workers and temporary (skilled) migrants {{in order to meet the}} needs of the economy.

That is why this paper aims to understand the dynamics behind the prospective Turkish migration into EU after membership and to provide a sound basis for its complicated nature. In order to do that, different theories of migration have been categorized at different levels of approaches and analyzed to understand the reasons for migration. To set the relationship between theory and reality of <b>migration,</b> the <b>statistics</b> on countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 have been used. After identifying the reasons why citizens of these new member states migrate, the prospective Turkish migration has been analyzed accordingly. It has been found out that the reasons for Turkish migration will be mostly the same as those for new member states’ citizens. As a result of this, it has been concluded that the prospective Turkish migration will be so diverse and complicated and that the direction of migration will not only be from Turkey to Europe but also from Europe to Turkey...|$|R

50|$|Having worked {{within the}} fields of socialization, family {{research}} and history of sociology, Heckmann {{began to focus on}} migration and integration research with his habilitation (The Federal Republic: A country of immigration?, Klett-Cotta, Stuttgart, 1981). Socio-structural analysis evidenced a status of belonging of the so-called guest workers; in addition historical and internationally comparative analysis demonstrated that Germany had been transformed into a country of immigration. Conceptual and theoretical works of Heckmann contribute to a theory of minorities, to the concept of ethnic colony, to the dimensional analysis of integration processes and to the theory of prejudice as both attitude and ideology. Much of this found in his book “Ethnische Minderheiten, Volk und Nation. Soziologie inter-ethnischer Beziehungen (Enke 1992). Since the foundation of the efms, Heckman has led numerous empirical research as well as practice-oriented projects. The efms’s projects mainly concern migration theory, <b>migration</b> <b>statistics,</b> migration politics, citizenship, urban and educational integration, studies on discrimination as well as evaluations of implemented policies and measures (for more information, please visit efms.de).

50|$|After World War Two, Malta's Emigration Department {{would assist}} emigrants {{with the cost}} of their travel. Between 1948 and 1967, 30 per cent of the {{population}} emigrated. After 1962, Maltese people required vouchers to migrate to the UK, but these were relatively easy to obtain from the Emigration Department until 1971. The Emigration Department would arrange for prospective migrants to be interviewed by British firms in order to allow their passage to the UK to fill labour shortages. At this time, it was also common for Maltese women to marry British military servicemen, and for Maltese to join British merchant ships. <b>Migration</b> <b>statistics</b> recorded in Malta and the UK differ {{in terms of the number}} of Maltese migrants recorded. Maltese statistics suggest that 8,282 people left Malta for the UK between 1963 and 1970 (inclusive), with 949 recorded as returning. British statistics, meanwhile, suggest that 8,110 Maltese migrants arrived in the same period, excluding students, diplomats, seamen, visitors and their families. Between 1946 and the late 1970s, over 140,000 people left Malta on the assisted passage scheme, with 57.6 per cent migrating to Australia, 22 per cent to the UK, 13 per cent to Canada and 7 per cent to the United States.|$|E
40|$|My {{bachelor}} thesis {{explores the}} connection between international migration and gender. Gender, defined as a social, not a biological term, has {{a huge impact on}} the <b>migration</b> process. <b>Statistics</b> and expert studies that have been gender sensitive since 1970 s demonstrate that women form half of the amount of the international migrants depending on the world region and representing a wide range of the kinds of international migration: family formation and reunification, labour migration, illegal and forced migration. Women and children represent the most threatened group of migrants; in various phases of their migration they often face discrimination, and emotional and physical abuse. To give a solution to these problems it is necessary for the STUDIES {{to pay more attention to}} the specific needs of both genders and the problems they both have to face. It is then possible to adjust the politics of migration and the activity of various non-governmental organizations which deal with the migrants more efficiently. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the studies of {{the connection between}} migration and gender further, and fill in gaps in gender sensitive studies.

40|$|The {{presence}} of finite-size particles in a channel flow {{close to the}} laminar-turbulent transition is simulated with the Force Coupling Method which allows two-way coupling with the flow dynamics. Spherical particles with channel height-to-particle diameter ratio of 16 are initially randomly seeded in a fluctuating flow above the critical Reynolds number corresponding to single phase flow relaminarization. When steady-state is reached, the particle volume fraction is homogeneously distributed in the channel cross-section (φ= 5 %) except in the near-wall region where it is larger due to inertia-driven <b>migration.</b> Turbulence <b>statistics</b> (intensity of velocity fluctuations, small-scale vortical structures, wall shear stress) calculated in the fully coupled two-phase flow simulations are compared to single-phase flow data in the transition regime. It is observed that particles increase the transverse r. m. s. flow velocity fluctuations and they break down the flow coherent structures into smaller, more numerous and sustained eddies, preventing the flow to relaminarize at the single-phase critical Reynolds number. When the Reynolds number is further decreased and the suspension flow becomes laminar, the wall friction coefficient recovers {{the evolution of the}} laminar single-phase law provided that the suspension viscosity is used in the Reynolds number definition.

Today, universities cannot carry out their functions by isolating themselves from social and humanitarian issues and crises. Instead, in addition to their three common functions (training-educating, research, public service) they should also adopt as their missions the prevention and solution of global terrorism, global warming, natural disasters, crises, global starvation, inequity in income distribution, inadequate health and education services, regional conflicts and disasters due to global <b>migration.</b> The <b>statistics</b> on global terrorism and high armaments expenditure, global starvation, regional conflicts, expenditures made to achieve peace, unequal distribution of income, inadequate health and education services, global migration, global unemployment, environmental pollution, global warming and poverty require the intervention of universities both qualitatively and quantitatively.With the aim of seeking answers to the question “What can world universities do in order to prevent the global problems? ”, the following themes have been discussed during the congress.|$|R

Using a newly constructed crosscountry of data series for remittances covering a large sample of developing countries, we relate the interaction between remittances and financial development and its impact on growth. We analyze how a country''s capacity to use remittances and its effectiveness in doing so might be influenced by local financial sector conditions. Given the difficulty of borrowing in developing countries, we explore the hypothesis that remittances can substitute for a lack of financial development and hence promote growth. The empirical analysis shows that remittances can promote growth in less financially developed countries. This relationship controls for the endogeneity of remittances and financial development using a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach, does not depend on the particular measure of financial sector development used, and is robust to a number of sensitivity tests.

Previous attempts to map the flows between origins and destinations have suffered from problems of occlusion usually requiring some form of generalisation, such as aggregation or flow density estimation {{before they can be}} visualized. This can lead to loss of detail or the introduction of arbitrary artefacts in the visual representation. Here, we propose mapping OD vectors as cells rather than lines, comparable with the process of constructing OD matrices, but unlike the OD matrix, we preserve the spatial layout of all origin and destination locations by constructing a gridded two‐level spatial treemap. The result is a set of spatially ordered small multiples upon which any arbitrary geographic data may be projected.

However, despite of efforts in providing guidelines, countries often differ not only in the data-collection and weighting model to reduce the non-response bias, but also in the operationalization of concepts such as migrants or minorities, and in the phrasing of the questions in their surveys, including the EU-Labor Force Survey (EU-LFS) and the EU-Survey on Income and Living Conditions (Huddleston et al., 2013, p. 33).

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the question}} of why people want to stay in the county-side has been analysed from an economic-historic perspective. The specific research question has been: Using which formal economic means of sustenance could those who remained in Ängersjö parish ensure their survival in the years 1950 to 1990 ? A number of different types of sources have been used, including income tax registers, data on <b>migration,</b> agricultural <b>statistics,</b> parish registers, interviews, and printed public statistics. The population of Ängersjö parish decreased through the entire period of investigation. In the early 1950 s the population pyramid in Ängersjö resembled Sweden’s quite considerably. After this point, the tendencies towards depopulation grew stronger. By the early 1990 s, the population had returned to the levels of the early 1800 s, i. e. before the forest became valuable. This time, however, the proportion of older inhabitants was much larger. Most of the remaining households supported themselves through wage labour in the forestry sector, which essentially was a male preoccupation. At the margin, supplementary incomes, such as the renting of cottages and capital revenues, could add to household earnings, and contributions by women probably played an important part in that context. In addition, informal economic activities, such as berry-picking and the exchange of labour, could expand the means of support by a maximum of 20 percent. In spite of all these efforts, most of the remaining households earned less than an average Swedish industrial worker. The income differences could to some degree be compensated by lower housing and living costs, but many households probably enjoyed a lower material standard of living. Demonstrably, most of the remaining inhabitants of Ängersjö were willing to pay the economic price associated with the “feelings of freedom” or the upkeep of their ancestral home of which many inhabitants spoke.

40|$|Genetic {{datasets}} {{can be used}} to date evolutionary events, even {{on recent}} time scales if sufficient data are available. We used statistics calculated from multilocus microsatellite datasets to estimate population ages in data generated through coalescent simulations and in samples from populations of known age in a metapopulation of Daphnia magna in Finland. Our simulation results show that age estimates improve with additional loci and define a time frame over which these statistics are most useful. On the most recent time scales, assumptions regarding the model of mutation (infinite sites vs. stepwise mutation) have little influence on estimated ages. In older populations, size homoplasy among microsatellite alleles results in a downwards bias for estimates based on the infinite sites model (ISM). In the Finnish D. magna metapopulation, our genetically derived estimated ages were biased upwards. Potential sources of this bias include the underlying model of mutation, gene flow, founder size, and the possibility of persistent source populations in the system.

40|$|Based on the <b>Migration</b> Board's <b>statistics</b> report, {{the number}} of {{children}} that has gone missing within a time interval of 4 years (2010 - 2014) comprises 1331 children in total, of whom 146 are girls and 1185 are boys. A rising interest about what has happened to those children created a fundamental platform for this thesis. By reading Åkerman’s report from 2012, and the book De förlorade barnen: en rapport by Mikkelsen and Wagner (2013) the curiosity grew deeper. The research questions that were established were divided into three parts. Their aim is to examine which organization or public authority has the main responsibility for asylum seeking children that arrives to Sweden by themselves, if the quality of the reception has changed since the municipalities took over the responsibility, and what is/has been publicly done to strengthen the protection concerning the individual child. The aim {{of this study is to}} authentically answer the research questions, using a qualitative text analysis and an implement model. The qualitative textual analysis is primarily based on reports from Gunnarsson (2008), the Cabinet Office (2011), and a report from the National Swedish Board of Health and Welfare published in 2012. Further reports and books are used in order to authenticate the legitimacy of the arguments and facts that is accounted for in this thesis. The implementation model that is used is an implement problem shaped by Pressman and Willdawsky. The model is used in order to force the problems that solemnly appear in this thesis. The conclusion establishes that within the distinctive reports it exists different views, but also similarities. The various texts establish that despite a set of rules and regulations there has been a considerable ambiguity among the involved parties, in who holds the greatest responsibility for the asylum-seeking children.
