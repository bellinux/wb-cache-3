By ensuring the detailed consideration of structural needs throughout the entire lifetime of an aircraft and focusing on the structural integration of needed past capabilities, Smart Intelligent Aircraft Structures will allow aircraft designers to seriously consider conformal morphing technologies. The reduced drag during take-off, cruise and landing for future and ecologically improved civil aircraft wings can be achieved through naturally laminar wing technology, by incorporating a gapless and deformable leading edge device with lift providing capability. Such a <b>morphing</b> <b>structure</b> typically consists of a flexible outer skin and an internal driving mechanism (Figure 1).Current aircraft designs already employ winglets aimed at increasing the cruise flight efficiency by induced drag reduction. Smart intelligent Structures propose a state of the art technology that incorporates a wingtip active trailing edge, which could be a means of reducing winglet and wing loads at key flight conditions.|$|E
40|$|Morphing {{structures}} have {{a multitude}} of potential applications in many engineering fields. Control surfaces for aircraft, pumps and valves for artificial organs or any application where a complex motion is required and can benefit from incorporating a <b>morphing</b> <b>structure.</b> The ability of a <b>morphing</b> <b>structure</b> to change its shape or configuration can potentially allow designs and functionality that {{would be impossible to}} realize without morphing. The focus of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility and operation of a structural shape <b>morphing</b> <b>structure.</b> Structural shape morphing is defined as shape change through material modulus changes. This allows fewer actuators, fewer moving parts and lower energy consumption to effect the same change in configuration as a traditional shape change structure. The <b>morphing</b> <b>structure</b> examined was designed and created specifically for this work and is composed almost entirely of polymer materials. The design utilizes electrical voltage to control the structural stiffness and motion of the structure independently. A review of literature covering fabrication and modeling in morphing structures, polymer actuators, variable modulus materials and variable stiffness structures is presented. A conceptual design for a shape <b>morphing</b> <b>structure</b> is fabricated and refined and an analytical model is developed for the structure to predict its response to applied voltages. The morphing structure’s capabilities are measured through experimental testing and the predictions of the analytical model are compared to the results. We demonstrate shape morphing by deforming the structure with an actuator, increasing the effective structural modulus and then removing the actuation force. Our tests show a fixed shape change in the structure of up to 20 % of the total deformation. Feasibility is also discussed for real-world applications and suggested areas for further exploration on the topic are presented...|$|E

40|$|A {{recently}} recognized {{application of}} lattice materials is shape morphing technology, where a structure {{is expected to}} take a predefined shape in response to a change in environmental (temperature, pressure, etc.) or loading conditions. In a shape <b>morphing</b> <b>structure</b> that uses a 2 D lattice material as the basis, one or more struts in the lattice are replaced by actuators. The shape of the structure is then changed by extending or shortening the lengths of these actuators. The shape <b>morphing</b> <b>structure</b> is stiff against external loads, yet triggering an actuator to morph the structure’s shape results in a minimal amount of internal energy storage. In the last two decades, most of the studies in shape morphing technology have focused on the Kagome lattice materials, which have superior properties such as in-plane isotropy, high specific stiffness and strength, and low energy requirement for actuation of its truss members. The Kagome lattice is a member of a large family of (semi-) regular tessellations of the plane. Two fundamental questions naturally arise: 1) What makes a lattice material suitable for actuation? 2) Are there other tessellations more effective than the Kagome lattice for actuation? This research tackles both questions, by comparing an alternative lattice material, the hexagonal cupola, with the Kagome lattice in terms of mechanical/actuation properties. Finally, a new criterion is formulated that will hopefully further facilitate the future search for lattice materials suitable for actuation.

This provides a feasible approach of controlling the deformation of the bistable shell through adjusting the applied temperature field.

Experimental and numerical studies {{in the fields of}} helicopter and wind turbine blade research have shown the potential of shape morphing in reducing blade loads. However, because of the large size of modern wind turbine blades, more similarities can be found with wing morphing research than with helicopter blades. Morphing technologies are currently receiving significant interest from the wind turbine community because of their potential high aerodynamic efficiency, simple construction and low weight. However, for actuator forces to be kept low, a compliant structure is needed. This is in apparent contradiction to the requirement for the blade to be load carrying and stiff. This highlights the key challenge for <b>morphing</b> <b>structures</b> in replacing the stiff and strong design of current blades with more compliant structures.

Many unsymmetric laminates {{have more than one}} stable room-temperature shape and can be snapped through from one stable shape to another. In this new concept for <b>morphing</b> <b>structures,</b> one or more piezoelectric actuators are bonded to unsymmetric laminates, and are then used to snap the laminate from one shape to another. The actuator would be used to change shape, but would not be required to maintain the shape. Using the Rayleigh-Ritz technique, several models are devel-oped to predict the interaction between the base laminate and the actuator. In particular, the volt-age (applied to the actuator) needed to snap the laminate is predicted. The NASA-LaRC Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC) actuator is chosen as the actuator of choice for this work. A laminate is manufactured, an actuator is bonded to the laminate, and experiments are performed.

40|$|One of the {{possibilities}} {{for the next generation}} of smart high-lift devices is to use a seamless <b>morphing</b> <b>structure.</b> A passive composite variable-stiffness skin as a solution to the dilemma of designing the structure to have high enough stiffness to withstand aerodynamic loading and low stiffness to enable morphing is proposed. The variable-stiffness skin is achieved by allowing for a spatial fibre angle and skin thickness variation on a morphing high-lift system. The stiffness distribution is tailored to influence the deformation of the structure beneficially. To design a realistic stiffness distribution, it is important to take aerodynamic and actuation loads into account during the optimization. A two-dimensional aero-servo-elastic framework is created for this purpose. Skin optimization is performed using a gradient-based optimizer, where sensitivity information is found through application of the adjoint method. The implementation of the aero-servo-elastic environment is addressed and initial optimization results presented. The results indicate that a variable-stiffness skin increases the design space.

An original technological process, which {{was applied to}} produce chiral components for aerospace <b>morphing</b> <b>structures,</b> is critically analysed and a new approach is proposed. The objective of such approach is the production of thin-walled chiral composite structures with enhanced strength properties by using a more feasible technology. According to the new methodology, chiral honeycombs with polygonal nodes are obtained by assembling thin-walled prismatic composite tubes. Numerical models are developed to investigate the behaviour of such topologies. A comparison with the performances of chiral honeycombs with cylindrical nodes is presented, showing that the new configuration can provide negative Poisson's ratios that tend to the theoretical limit of − 1 as the stiffness of the polygonal nodes is increased. Thereafter, a method to fill partially the nodes is proposed and numerically assessed, to enhance {{at the same time}} the auxetic behaviour and the mechanical properties of the chiral honeycomb.
