25|$|At {{the first}} race in Argentina, {{he felt the}} car was {{difficult}} to handle and on a fast lap, the front wing became detached striking his helmet. In the race, Hunt retired due to an electrical fault. In Brazil, he retired on lap 6 due to instability under braking caused by a loose steering rack. During qualifying in South Africa, the brakes on his car failed. He <b>managed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> collide with the wall, but only finished 8th in the race. He retired at the Spanish Grand Prix after 26 laps. At Zolder, a new Wolf WR8 was raced but Hunt crashed into a barrier hard enough to bounce back onto the track. After failing to finish the 1979 Monaco Grand Prix, the race where six years previously {{he had made his}} debut, Hunt made a statement on 8 June 1979 to the press announcing his immediate retirement from F1 competition, citing his situation in the championship. Despite going into retirement, he continued to work to promote his personal sponsors Marlboro and Olympus.|$|E
25|$|At Spa, he {{qualified}} 4th, but {{suffered from}} anti-stall {{for the third}} time in 2009 and he found himself last, but missed the first lap crash which took out four drivers including teammate Button. While the safety car was out he pitted and changed strategy which enabled him to climb back up to 7th. During the last three laps the car had an engine oil leak, but he still managed to finish, before his car caught fire in the pit lane after the race. At Monza, he qualified 5th, despite carrying more fuel to try a different strategy with only one stop. After passing Kovalainen at the start, Barrichello <b>managed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> lose too much time, as he had the advantage of just one stop against Hamilton, Räikkönen and Sutil's two stop strategy. By Hamilton's second pit stop, Button and Barrichello were running first and second. Hamilton tried to pressure Button by forcing his car, but on the last lap he crashed, giving third place to Räikkönen, and fourth to Sutil. Barrichello won the 11th race in his Formula One career, and gained more points on Button in their fight for the world title.|$|E
25|$|Furtwängler campaigned to {{convince}} Nazi leaders {{to abandon their}} plans. According to historian Fred K. Prieberg, he conducted concerts (often with the Vienna Philharmonic) {{in the presence of}} German leaders during this period in exchange for the conservation of the orchestra. He organized several concerts of Austrian music in Berlin and Vienna for Hitler, to highlight Austrian culture. The Nazi leadership, who wanted {{to take advantage of this}} situation, invited Furtwängler in 1938 to conduct Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg with the Vienna Philharmonic in Nürnberg for the Nazi party congress. Furtwängler accepted to conduct, as long as the performance was not during the party congress. Hitler eventually accepted Furtwängler's conditions: the concert took place on 5 September and the political event was formally opened the following morning. This concert, along with one given in Berlin in 1942 for Hitler's birthday, led to heavy criticism of Furtwängler after the war. However, Furtwängler had <b>managed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> participate in the party congress. He had also succeeded in conserving the Vienna Philharmonic, and the musical collections of Vienna and the Vienna Opera, where he persuaded Hitler and Goebbels to agree to the appointment of Karl Böhm as artistic director. At the Vienna Philharmonic, as at the Berlin Philharmonic, Furtwängler succeeded in protecting 'half-Jews' or members with 'non-aryan' wives until the end of the war (these were exceptional cases in Germany during the Nazi period). However, in contrast to his experience with the Berlin Philharmonic, he could not save the lives of 'full-blooded' Jews: they were persecuted, with a number dying in concentration camps.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{considers}} [...] "Photograph" [...] a [...] "gorgeous collaboration" [...] between Starr and Harrison, a {{track that}} [...] "ranks... {{among the very}} best post-Beatles songs {{by any of the}} Fab Four". Robert Rodriguez describes it as [...] "an elegantly produced ballad" [...] and Starr's [...] "signature tune as a solo artist". Rodriguez continues: [...] "The ersatz Wall of Sound somehow <b>managed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> swamp the lead vocal and Harrison harmony, while embodying the best qualities of the Beatles' singles: hummable and familiar, yet fresh and enduring." [...] In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner wrote of how the song's [...] "grand, sweeping arrangement" [...] was reminiscent of Harrison's [...] "own recent cosmic productions". Author Elliot Huntley similarly acknowledges the extent of Harrison's influence on this and other tracks on Ringo while rueing that [...] "Photograph" [...] marks the only formal co-composition by the two ex-Beatles. Huntley describes the song as the album's [...] "stand-out track" [...] and [...] "by a country mile, the commercial high-point" [...] for Starr as a songwriter. Former Mojo editor Mat Snow recognises it as [...] "perhaps the single best song of [...] career" [...] and the [...] "emotional heart" [...] of the album.|$|E

Hambro credited Roy Eldridge, a mentor from his initial years with Gene Krupa's band, for his being able to shun narcotics. When Hambro was just 19, Roy forced him to watch a band member inject heroin, and stay to watch its effects, with a stern warning not {{to get involved with}} drugs.|$|E
