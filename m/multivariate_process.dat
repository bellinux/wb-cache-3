50|$|Many {{chemical}} {{problems and}} applications of chemometrics involve calibration. The {{objective is to}} develop models {{which can be used}} to predict properties of interest based on measured properties of the chemical system, such as pressure, flow, temperature, infrared, Raman, NMR spectra and mass spectra. Examples include the development of multivariate models relating 1) multi-wavelength spectral response to analyte concentration, 2) molecular descriptors to biological activity, 3) <b>multivariate</b> <b>process</b> conditions/states to final product attributes. The process requires a calibration or training data set, which includes reference values for the properties of interest for prediction, and the measured attributes believed to correspond to these properties. For case 1), for example, one can assemble data from a number of samples, including concentrations for an analyte of interest for each sample (the reference) and the corresponding infrared spectrum of that sample. Multivariate calibration techniques such as partial-least squares regression, or principal component regression (and near countless other methods) are then used to construct a mathematical model that relates the multivariate response (spectrum) to the concentration of the analyte of interest, and such a model can be used to efficiently predict the concentrations of new samples.|$|E

40|$|In {{real life}} we always come across autocorrelated <b>multivariate</b> <b>process</b> where the present process {{is related to}} the {{previous}} process. This type of process can be modeled using the traditional multivariate time series models and then the process control can be conducted based on the residual which becomes univariate in nature. However, in this paper, we show that many time series are governed by a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) process. In this case, instead of time series modeling, we only need an appropriate transformation {{to come up with the}} condition required in the traditional <b>multivariate</b> <b>process</b> control. Therefore, under GBM process, traditional <b>multivariate</b> <b>process</b> control can be used on the transformed time series data.

The {{first part of}} this thesis is devoted to properties which <b>multivariate</b> counting <b>processes</b> may possess. Such properties are, for example, the Markov property, the multinomial property and regularity. With regard to regularity we study the properties of transition probabilities and intensities. The second part of this thesis restricts the class of all <b>multivariate</b> counting <b>processes</b> by additional assumptions leading to different types of <b>multivariate</b> mixed Poisson <b>processes</b> which, however, are connected with each other. Using a multivariate version of the Bernstein-Widder theorem, it is shown that <b>multivariate</b> mixed Poisson <b>processes</b> are characterized by the multinomial property. Furthermore, regularity of <b>multivariate</b> mixed Poisson <b>processes</b> and properties of their moments are studied in detail. Throughout this thesis, two types of stability of properties of <b>multivariate</b> counting <b>processes</b> are studied: It is shown that most properties of a <b>multivariate</b> counting <b>process</b> are stable under certain linear transformations including the selection of single coordinates and summation of all coordinates.

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of a <b>multivariate</b> <b>process</b> {{with the use}} of multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) charts has received considerable attention. However, in practice, the use of MSPC chart typically encounters a difficulty. This difficult involves which quality variable or which set of the quality variables is responsible for the generation of the signal. This study proposes a hybrid scheme which is composed of independent component analysis (ICA) and support vector machine (SVM) to determine the fault quality variables when a step-change disturbance existed in a <b>multivariate</b> <b>process.</b> The proposed hybrid ICA-SVM scheme initially applies ICA to the Hotelling T 2 MSPC chart to generate independent components (ICs). The hidden information of the fault quality variables can be identified in these ICs. The ICs are then served as the input variables of the classifier SVM for performing the classification process. The performance of various process designs is investigated and compared with the typical classification method. Using the proposed approach, the fault quality variables for a <b>multivariate</b> <b>process</b> can be accurately and reliably determined...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMost of the {{researches}} {{developed for}} single response and multi response optimization problems {{are based on}} the normality assumption of responses, while this assumption does not necessarily hold in real situations. In the real world processes, each product can contain correlated responses which follow different distributions.

In this paper a new approach is presented based on <b>multivariate</b> <b>process</b> capability index and NORTA inverse transformation for multi response optimization problem with mixed continuous-discrete responses. In the proposed approach, assuming distribution function of the responses is known in advance based on historical data; first we transform the multivariate mixed continuous-discrete responses using NORTA inverse transformation to obtain multivariate normal distributed responses. Then the <b>multivariate</b> <b>process</b> capability index is computed in each treatment. Finally, for determining the optimum treatment, the geometric mean value of <b>multivariate</b> <b>Process</b> Capability Index (PCI) is computed for each factor level and the most capable levels are selected as the optimum setting.
