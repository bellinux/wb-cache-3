40|$|PR 65 is the two-layered (α-α solenoid) HEAT-repeat (Huntingtin, {{elongation}} factor 3, a subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A, PI 3 kinase target of rapamycin 1) scaffold of protein phosphatase PP 2 A. Molecular dynamics simulations predict that, at forces expected in living systems, PR 65 undergoes (visco-) elastic deformations {{in response to}} pulling/pushing on its ends. At lower forces, smooth global flexural and torsional changes occur via even redistribution of stress along the hydrophobic core of the molecule. At intermediate forces, helix–helix separation along one layer (“fracturing”) leads to global relaxation plus loss of contact in the other layer to unstack the affected units. Fracture sites are determined by unusual sequences in contiguous interhelix turns. Normal mode analysis of the heterotrimeric PP 2 A enzyme reveals that its ambient conformational fluctuations are dominated by elastic deformations of PR 65, which introduce a mechanical linkage between the separately bound regulatory and catalytic subunits. PR 65 -dominated fluctuations of PP 2 A {{have the effect of}} opening and closing the enzyme’s substrate binding/catalysis interface, as well as altering the positions of certain catalytic residues. These results suggest that substrate binding/catalysis are sensitive to mechanical force. Force could be imposed from the outside (e. g., in PP 2 A’s response to spindle tension) or arise spontaneously (e. g., in PP 2 A’s interaction with unstructured proteins such as Tau, a microtubule-associated Alzheimer’s-implicated protein).

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJames S. DrouillardA {{series of}} studies were {{conducted}} to evaluate extrusion processing of finishing diets on growth performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality attributes of feedlot cattle. Extruded diets were processed in a 24 : 1 (length/diameter) corotating, fully intermeshing twinscrew extruder (model BCTG- 62, Bühler AG CH- 9240, Uzwil, Switzerland). In Experiment 1, extrusion processing of corn based diets decreased dry matter intake (DMI) and improved gain efficiency (G:F) by 15 % compared to heifers fed steam-flaked corn (SFC) diets. Carcass characteristics were not different between treatments. Steaks from heifers fed SFC diets were juicier and had a less pronounced off-flavor than steaks from heifers fed extruded diets. In Experiment 2, average daily gain (ADG), DMI, G:F, carcass characteristics, and meat quality attributes were not different between heifers fed SFC and extruded processed corn diets. In Experiment 3, we evaluated different degrees of extrusion processing by altering the level of process water added to the extruder. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>inputs,</b> die pressure, die temperature, and torque of drive motor decreased {{as the level of}} water added to the extruder increased from 4 % to 12 %. Water addition did not affect DMI or ADG of feedlot heifers. However, live body weight (BW) and G:F decreased as the level of process water increased. Gain efficiency (carcass-adjusted basis) was 3 % greater for extruded corn diets processed with 4 % water compared with SFC diets and was 6 % poorer than SFC diets when processed with 12 % water. Apparent total tract digestibility was not different, but IVDMD improved with increasing levels of water. Improvements in G:F when fed extruded feed was variable among the 3 studies. This may be due, in part to severe infestation by European Starlings during Experiment 1. Impact of feed depredation by starlings was therefore evaluated. Starlings consumed 86 % of the SFC diet offered to them compared to, none of the extruded corn diets. In addition, starlings preferentially selected for the energy dense portion of the rations (steam-flaked corn). Therefore, it is plausible that a portion of the 15 % improvement in G:F observed in Experiment 1 for heifers fed extruded corn diets can be attributed to differences in feed depredation by starlings. Finally, two studies were conducted to evaluate extrusion processing of sorghum-based diets. In the first experiment, DMI was greater and G:F was poorer for heifers fed extruded sorghum diets compared to heifers fed steam-flaked sorghum (SFS) diets. However, carcass characteristics and meat quality attributes were not different. In the second study, particle size of the ground sorghum added to the extruder was evaluated. Processing sorghum to a smaller particle size (581 μm) prior to extrusion processing decreased DMI, improved G:F, and increased apparent total tract digestibility compared with larger particle sizes (1, 264 μm). However, heifers fed SFS diets were still more efficient that heifers fed extruded diets made with either particle size of sorghum. Overall, this research suggests that extruding complete diets into homogeneous pellets may improve G:F of cattle fed corn-based diets while reducing feed depredation of starlings. It is also clear from our results that G:F is improved to a greater extent to processing diets under high shear conditions (i. e., high <b>mechanical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>inputs)</b> than when processed under low shear conditions...|$|R

A list of 73 XMM-Newton and 28 Chandra detections of {{point-like}} X-ray {{sources in the}} field is provided; a substantial fraction of them are likely stellar objects in the Milky Way due to the low Galactic latitude location of IC 10. The brightest source in the IC 10 field, X- 1, has a mean 0. 3 - 8. 0 keV luminosity of ∼ 1. 2 × 10 38 erg s − 1 and shows a large variation by a factor of up to ∼ 6 on time scales of ∼ 10 4 s during the XMM-Newton observation. The X-ray spectra of the source indicate the presence of a multi-color blackbody accretion disk with an inner disk temperature Tin ≈ 1. 1 keV. These results are consistent with the interpretation of the source as a stellar mass black hole, probably accreting from a Wolf-Rayet star companion. We infer the mass of this black hole to be ∼ 4 M ⊙ if it is not spinning, or a factor of up to ∼ 6 higher if there is significant spinning. We also detect an apparent diffuse soft X-ray emission component of IC 10. An effective method is devised to remove the X-ray CCD-readout streaks of X- 1 that strongly affect the study of the diffuse component in the XMM-Newton and Chandra observations. We find that the diffuse X-ray morphology is oriented along the optical body of the galaxy and is chiefly associated with starburst regions.

40|$|In {{agricultural}} production, {{disturbance of}} the soil by cultivation occurs regularly. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>energy</b> applied in this way can have a adverse effect on soil stability, a lowering of soil organic matter (S_OM), and a increase in CO 2 emissions. These changes result in unwanted environmental consequences and compromise the ability of soil to maintain a competitive and sustainable agricultural industry. As agricultural systems evolve, it becomes important to develop a indication of their sustainability with regard to soil structure, well before any serious consequences become apparent. The am of this work was to quantify the effect of <b>mechanical</b> <b>energy</b> (in particular tillage) on soil structural stability {{and the loss of}} SOM. New laboratory techniques were devised in which <b>mechanical</b> <b>energy</b> was applied to a range of soils at different water contents with measurements made of stability and the mineralization of SOM. Techniques used for characterising stability involved measuring mechanically-dispersed clay, cm using a turbid metric technique and the proportion of water stable aggregates (> 250 m). A re-examination of the statistical theory of brittle fracture showed that soil friability, F 1, could be quantised using the coincident of Variation of tensile-strength of a population of similar sized aggregates. Specific energies associated with different cultivation practices, were simulated using a falling weight and results indicated that the sensitivity of soil to mechanical damage was essentially zero at soil water contents below the plastic limit (wpL). With increasing soil water content, sensitivity to destabilization increased sharply. The empirical model to characterise these phenomena was evaluated under field conditions where the energy consumption of different tillage implements, operating at different soil water contents, was measured directly. Good agreement between the level of destabilization measured in the field and those in the laboratory was obtained at similar specific energy values. C. W. Watts, 2003. Cranfield University, Silsoe. The field experiments also showed that increased levels of cm following tillage were responsible for stronger and less friable day aggregates. More experiments on a soil with SOC values ranging from all to 32 g/kg enabled the original model to be refined, linking cm, SOC and soil water content to disruptive energy. This {{led to the development of}} a index, S, which quantise the sensitivity of soil to destabilization by <b>mechanical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> and provides a method for identifying soils at risk. The effect of <b>mechanical</b> <b>energy</b> on the mineralization of SOC was measured using the falling-weight. Mineralization was characterised by measuring soil respiration using data-logging, conductinetric respirometers, built to monitor CO 2 emissions following applications of <b>mechanical</b> <b>energy.</b> Changes in respiration were characterised by the respiration ratio, rr (defied a respiration following the application of energy divided by basal respiration). Higher values of, rr, were associated with greater energy levels, particularly on soils with lower SOC. Increased respiration was also measured following tillage in the field, particularly from soils following tillage at high energy levels where the effect lasted for several weeks. In this work three physically based measures of soil quality (S, F 1 and rr) have been used to quantify the effects of tillage of different intensities on soil structural stability and the loss of organic matter. Parameters common to these measures of soil quality are SOC content, soil-water content and tillage intensity. Results of this work indicate that organic matter, physically protected by stable soil structures, can b exposed to mineralization when the structure in destabilized during tillage, particularly a the soil becomes wetter (w>w 1 ºL). The practical consequences of this work concluded that increasing the levels of SOC, cultivating the soil at water contents below the plastic limit and a reduced <b>energy</b> <b>input,</b> provide the best practical approach to maintaining soil physical quality. The new methodologies developed here have helped improve understanding of the effects of <b>mechanical</b> <b>energy</b> on soil structural condition.

Furthermore, the experimental results showed, that even lower temperatures of 17 C are sufficient thus reducing the demand for cooling capacity. During the operation, the compressor achieved stable compression of hydrogen from 7 bar more than 220 bar. The specific productivity of the compressor achieved values up to 67. 2 lH 2 kg 1 h 1...|$|R

Flotation {{is one of the most}} widely used processes in the beneficiation of minerals. The process is characterized by a number of important sub-processes each with their own set of critical variables. These include: • The pulp phase which is influenced by variables such as pH, Eh, the nature of the chemical reagents used, the chemical state of the surface of the ore particles, etc. • The reactor in which the process occurs, viz. the flotation cell, which is influenced by factors such as aspect ratio, degree of agitation, <b>mechanical</b> design criteria, <b>energy</b> <b>input,</b> aeration processes, etc. • The froth phase which is arguably the heart of the process and probably the least well understood but which is influenced by factors such as size and shape of the solid particles in the froth, the nature of the surfactant used, the aeration rate, the water recovery rate, the froth depth, etc...|$|R
40|$|Superbubbles {{surrounding}} OB associations provide ideal laboratories {{to study}} the stellar energy feedback problem because the stellar <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> can be estimated from the observed stellar content of the OB associations and the interstellar thermal and kinetic energies of superbubbles are well-defined and easy to observe. We have used DEM L 192, also known as N 51 D, {{to carry out a}} detailed case study of the energy budget in a superbubble, and we find that the expected amount of stellar <b>mechanical</b> <b>energy</b> injected into the ISM, (18 +- 5) x 10 ^ 51 ergs, exceeds the amount of thermal and kinetic energies stored in the superbubble, (6 +- 2) x 10 ^ 51 ergs. Clearly, a significant fraction of the stellar <b>mechanical</b> <b>energy</b> must have been converted to other forms of energy. The X-ray spectrum of the diffuse emission from DEM L 192 requires a power-law component to explain the featureless emission at 1. 0 - 3. 0 keV. The origin of this power-law component is unclear, but it may be responsible for the discrepancy between the stellar <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> and the observed interstellar energy in DEM L 192.
