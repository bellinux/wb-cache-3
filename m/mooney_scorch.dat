40|$|The {{dependence}} of the <b>Mooney</b> <b>scorch</b> time and cure index on the blend ratio of chlorosulphonated polyethylene/natural rubber (CSM/SMR 20 CV) and chlorosulphonated polyethylene/chlorinated natural rubber (CSM/Pergut S 40) blends were determined in the temperature range from 120 oC to 160 oC using a Monsanto Mooney viscometer. Semi-efficient vulcanization systems {{were used for the}} study. The morphology of the fracture surface of the crosslinked systems was determined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the scorch time decreased with increasing SMR 20 CV and Pergut S 40 contents. This observation is attributed to the increasing solubility of sulfur, as the content of SMR 20 CV and Pergut S 40 in the composition increased. For temperatures greater than 140 oC, the {{dependence of}} the scorch time on blend ratios diminishes, as enough thermal energy is available to overcome the activation energy of vulcanization. The differing curing characteristics of the two blends is explained by the compatibility factor of the respective blend. Morphological analysis of the blends shows a very satisfactory agreement...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} substances {{were used}} as additives: maleated rosin modified with oleic acid, containing maleopimaric acid (≈ 50 %) which did not react with maleic anhydride rosin acids; rosin-itaconic ac-id adduct, containing up to ≈ 50 % of citraconopimaric acid as a mixture of two isomers; octylimide of rosin-itaconic acid adduct; imide of maleated rosin and aniline, containing up to ≈ 50 % of N-phenylimide of maleopimaric acid; imidoamide of maleated rosin and aniline, containing maleo-pimaric acid anilide N-phenylimide; imidoamide of maleated rosin and p-anisidine, containing maleopimaric acid p-methoxyphenylamide N-(p-methoxyphenyl) imide. Their uses as processing aids in rubber compounds based on synthetic isoprene rubber are considered. Processing parameters, such as <b>Mooney</b> viscosity, <b>scorch</b> resistance, kinetic characteristics of vulcanization of the rubber mixtures with nitrogen adducts of rosin are investigated...|$|R
