5|$|Although {{water is}} vital for life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol is not well understood, mostly because methods such as nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale. Even the structure of pure water is poorly understood, due {{to the ability of}} water to form structures such as water clusters through hydrogen bonds.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} is {{the design}} and manufacture of artificial nucleic acid structures for technological uses. In this field, nucleic acids are used as non-biological engineering materials for nanotechnology rather than as the carriers of genetic information in living cells. Researchers in the field have created static structures such as two- and three-dimensional crystal lattices, nanotubes, polyhedra, and arbitrary shapes, and functional devices such as molecular machines and DNA computers. The field is beginning {{to be used as}} a tool to solve basic science problems in structural biology and biophysics, including applications in X-ray crystallography and nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> of proteins to determine structures. Potential applications in molecular scale electronics and nanomedicine are also being investigated.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, almost 150 {{years after}} the Byne's disease was first {{mentioned}} in the literature, Norman H. Tennent and Thomas Baird published an extensive study on the subject. Their deep analysis, involving many complex and sophisticated techniques such as X-Ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> finally revealed {{the true nature of}} the decaying process. They identified the substances involved (the calcium salts), as well as the chemical reactions that originated them. They concluded that Byne's disease is not actually a disease, and is in fact caused by simple chemical reactions which occur in the presence of acidic vapors originating from the immediate environment in which the specimens are stored.|$|E

In 2010, in close {{cooperation with the}} Center for Protein Folding Machinery, these drug leads began to be tested on biological tissue. In 2011, Folding@home completed simulations of several mutations of Aβ that appear to stabilize the aggregate formation, which could aid {{in the development of}} therapeutic drug therapies for the disease and greatly assist with experimental nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> studies of Aβ oligomers.

25|$|Deuterium oxide is used {{in nuclear}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> when using water as solvent if the nuclide of {{interest}} is hydrogen.

25|$|The {{differences}} {{are much more}} pronounced in vibrational spectroscopy such as infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, and in rotational spectra such as microwave spectroscopy because the reduced mass of the deuterium is markedly {{higher than that of}} protium. In nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> deuterium has a very different NMR frequency (e.g. 61 MHz when protium is at 400 MHz) and is much less sensitive. Deuterated solvents are usually used in protium NMR to prevent the solvent from overlapping with the signal, although deuterium NMR on its own right is also possible.|$|E
25|$|In nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (NMR), {{chemical}} shift is usually expressed in ppm. It represents {{the difference of}} a measured frequency in parts per million from the reference frequency. The reference frequency depends on the instrument's magnetic field and the element being measured. It is usually expressed in MHz. Typical {{chemical shift}}s are rarely {{more than a few}} hundred Hz from the reference frequency, so chemical shifts are conveniently expressed in ppm (Hz/MHz). Parts-per notation gives a dimensionless quantity that does not depend on the instrument's field strength.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, the {{sensitivity}} of nuclear magnetic resonance signals is also dependent {{on the presence of}} a magnetically susceptible nuclide and, therefore, either on the natural abundance of such nuclides or on the ability of the experimentalist to artificially enrich the molecules, under study, with such nuclides. The most abundant naturally occurring isotopes of hydrogen and phosphorus (for example) are both magnetically susceptible and readily useful for nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> In contrast, carbon and nitrogen have useful isotopes but which occur only in very low natural abundance.|$|E
50|$|Within an atom, only s-orbitals have non-zero {{electron}} density at the nucleus, so the contact interaction only occurs for s-electrons. Its major manifestation is in electron paramagnetic <b>resonance</b> and nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopies,</b> {{where it is}} responsible for the appearance of isotropic hyperfine coupling. Roughly, the magnitude of A indicates {{the extent to which the}} unpaired spin resides on the nucleus. Thus, knowledge of the A values allows one to map the singly occupied molecular orbital.|$|R

25|$|Like nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>{{spectroscopy}},</b> Mössbauer spectroscopy probes tiny {{changes in}} the energy levels of an atomic nucleus in response to its environment. Typically, three types of nuclear interactions may be observed: an isomeric shift, {{also known as a}} chemical shift; quadrupole splitting; and magnetic splittings due to the Zeeman effect or hyperfine splitting. Due to the high energy and extremely narrow line widths of gamma rays, Mössbauer spectroscopy is a very sensitive technique in terms of energy (and hence frequency) resolution, capable of detecting change in just a few parts per 1011.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{pulses of}} {{different}} shapes, frequencies and durations in specifically designed patterns or pulse sequences allows the spectroscopist to extract {{many different types}} of information about the molecule. Multi-dimensional nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> is a kind of FT NMR in which {{there are at least two}} pulses and, as the experiment is repeated, the pulse sequence is systematically varied. In multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance there will be a sequence of pulses and, at least, one variable time period. In three dimensions, two time sequences will be varied. In four dimensions, three will be varied.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) {{is a physical}} phenomenon in which nuclei in a magnetic field absorb and re-emit electromagnetic radiation. This energy is at a specific resonance frequency which depends {{on the strength of}} the magnetic field and the magnetic properties of the isotope of the atoms; in practical applications, the frequency is similar to VHF and UHF television broadcasts (60–1000MHz). NMR allows the observation of specific quantum mechanical magnetic properties of the atomic nucleus. Many scientific techniques exploit NMR phenomena to study molecular physics, crystals, and non-crystalline materials through nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> NMR is also routinely used in advanced medical imaging techniques, such as in {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI).|$|E
