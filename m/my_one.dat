[...] "I knew when I got the assignment," [...] he told a reporter in 2005, [...] "it {{was going to be}} an emotional thing. We had feelings, but we had to put them in the background. We knew it was going to kill people right and left. But <b>my</b> <b>one</b> driving interest was to do the best job I could so that we could end the killing as quickly as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|McCain was {{mentioned}} as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination beginning in 1997, but he took few steps to pursue it, instead concentrating on his 1998 senate re-election. [...] The decision of General Colin Powell not to run helped persuade McCain {{that there might be}} an opening for him. [...] McCain later wrote that he had a [...] "vague aspiration" [...] of running for president for a long time. [...] He would also be candid about his motivation: [...] "I didn't decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism. In truth, I wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to become president. I was sixty-two years old when I made the decision, and I thought it was <b>my</b> <b>one</b> shot at the prize." ...|$|E

[...] On references or [...] "easter eggs" [...] in the season, Rosenberg explained that [...] "A little is always there and in the writer’s room we have some fanboys that know all this stuff and they’re all geeking out with different stuff....a lot of references are to the [...]" [...] She also said that nods to the larger MCU are in the season, with each episode having a [...] "little something in it." ...|$|E

500|$|... "My Moment" [...] is a self-empowerment {{song that}} lasts {{for three minutes}} and twenty-five seconds. It is {{composed}} in the key of E major, simply using three major chords (E, B, and A, respectively). According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, the song [...] "is addressing all those haters who didn't necessarily get her last viral smash, [...] "Friday". Black starts singing the lyrics [...] "Weren't you {{the one who said}} that I would be nothing?/ Well, I'm about to prove you wrong/ I'm {{not the only one who}} believes in something/ <b>My</b> <b>one</b> wish is about to come true." [...] As the song goes, Black addresses her negative reception even more, singing, [...] "Haters, said I'll see you later/Can't talk to you right now/I'm getting my paper". [...] "My Moment" [...] features a simple mid-tempo melody with a prominent uses of garish keyboards on its background. Uses of pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune on Black's vocals were also noticed.|$|E
500|$|The {{installment}} {{has been}} very positively received by the show's cast and crew. Series creator Steve Franks was asked by iTunes in 2009 to select his twelve favorite episodes {{to be put on}} a special DVD release. The collection, titled Psych: Twelve Episodes That Will Make You Happy, contained four episodes from the first season, including [...] "Spellingg Bee". When describing the episode, Franks stated that [...] "The Spellingg Bee has <b>my</b> <b>one</b> of my favorite scenes in the run of the show when Shawn takes over for the spellmaster and has to investigate a murder while making up words for the contestants to spell". In 2013, iTunes asked stars James Roday and Dulé Hill to select their 20 favorite episodes from the show. The DVD collection was titled Psych: James and Dule's Top 20, with [...] "Spellingg Bee" [...] was selected as #14 on the collection, picked by Roday. Three other episodes from the first season were also selected.|$|E
500|$|On 11 February 1965, Starr married Maureen Cox, whom he {{had first}} met in 1962. By this time the stress and {{pressure}} that went along with Beatlemania had reached a peak for him. He received a telephoned death threat before a show in Montreal, and resorted to positioning his cymbals vertically {{in an attempt to}} provide protection from would-be assassins. The constant pressure of the Beatles' fame affected their live performances; Starr commented: [...] "We were turning into such bad musicians ... there was no groove to it." [...] He was also feeling increasingly isolated from the musical activities of his bandmates, who were moving past the traditional boundaries of rock music into territory that often did not require his accompaniment; during recording sessions he spent countless hours playing cards with their road manager Neil Aspinall and roadie Mal Evans while the other Beatles perfected tracks without him. In a letter published in Melody Maker, a fan asked the Beatles to let Starr sing more; he replied: [...] " [...] quite happy with <b>my</b> <b>one</b> little track on each album".|$|E

500|$|With Indicud, {{on several}} tracks Cudi took a {{backseat}} in vocals to rather showcase his production skills. [...] "The {{focus was on}} producing the record for Kendrick, I wanted to shine as a producer first. I wanted to show that side off {{more than anything else}} and that's why I had <b>my</b> <b>one</b> verse then let Kendrick go ape-sh-- crazy all over the rest of it." [...] As for the A$AP Rocky feature on [...] "Brothers," [...] Cudi explained that he made the decision to go with a minimal hook and let the Harlem rapper dominate the track: [...] "I felt like that was a perfect beat for A$AP to get on there and speak some truths and talk to the younger generation, because he's in a place where a lot of kids are up to him and Kendrick. I just wanted to hear him say something a little bit more thoughtful, and he did that — he showed up. I was blown away by his craftsmanship, his professionalism and his overall mojo." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Love began {{composing}} {{an album}} with songwriter Linda Perry of 4 Non Blondes, titled America's Sweetheart, also reuniting with drummer Patty Schemel. Love signed with Virgin Records to release it, and began recording it in France in 2003. America's Sweetheart {{was released in}} February 2004, and received mixed reviews from critics. Charles Aaron of Spin called it a [...] "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's Live Through This" [...] and awarded it eight out of ten stars, while The Village Voice said: [...] " [...] willing to act out the dream of every teenage brat who ever {{wanted to have a}} glamorous, high-profile hissyfit, and she turns those egocentric nervous breakdowns into art. Sure, the art becomes less compelling when you've been pulling the same stunts for a decade. But, honestly, is there anybody out there who fucks up better?" [...] The album sold less than 100,000 copies. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame: [...] "America's Sweetheart was <b>my</b> <b>one</b> true piece of shit. It has no cohesive thread. I just hate it", she said in a 2014 interview. Shortly after the record was released, Love told Kurt Loder on TRL: [...] "I cannot exist as a solo artist. It's a joke." ...|$|E
500|$|On the tour, {{the dynamic}} nature of Bradman's batting contrasted sharply with his quiet, solitary off-field demeanour. He was {{described}} as aloof from his teammates {{and he did not}} offer to buy them a round of drinks, let alone share the money given to him by Whitelaw. Bradman spent a lot of his free time alone, writing, as he had sold the rights to a book. On his return to Australia, Bradman was surprised by the intensity of his reception; he became a [...] "reluctant hero". Mick Simmons wanted to cash in on their employee's newly won fame. They asked Bradman to leave his teammates and attend official receptions they organised in Adelaide, Melbourne, Goulburn, his hometown Bowral and Sydney, where he received a brand new custom-built Chevrolet. At each stop, Bradman received a level of adulation that [...] "embarrassed" [...] him. This focus on individual accomplishment, in a team game, [...] "...permanently damaged relationships with his contemporaries". Commenting on Australia's victory, the team's vice-captain Vic Richardson said, [...] "...we could have played any team without Bradman, but we could not have played the blind school without Clarrie Grimmett". A modest Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying [...] "I have always endeavoured to do my best for the side, and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches. <b>My</b> <b>one</b> idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 1921, Stieglitz's {{photographs}} of O'Keeffe {{were included in}} a retrospective exhibition at the Anderson Galleries. Stieglitz started photographing O'Keeffe when she visited him in New York City to see her 1917 exhibition, and continued taking photographs, {{many of which were}} in the nude. It created a public sensation. When he retired from photography in 1937, he had made more than 350 portraits of her. In 1978, she wrote about how distant from them she had become, [...] "When I look over the photographs Stieglitz took of me-some of them more than sixty years ago—I wonder who that person is.

2500|$|Broadway audiences welcomed musicals that {{varied from}} {{the golden age}} style and substance. John Kander and Fred Ebb {{explored}} the rise of Nazism in Germany in Cabaret, and murder and the media in Prohibition-era Chicago, which relied on old vaudeville techniques. Pippin, by Stephen Schwartz, was set {{in the days of}} Charlemagne. Federico Fellini's autobiographical film 8½ became Maury Yeston's Nine. At the end of the decade, Evita and Sweeney Todd were precursors of the darker, big budget musicals of the 1980s that depended on dramatic stories, sweeping scores and spectacular effects. At the same time, old-fashioned values were still embraced in such hits as Annie, 42nd Street, <b>My</b> <b>One</b> and Only, and popular revivals of No, No, Nanette and Irene. [...] Although many film versions of musicals were made in the 1970s, few were critical or box office successes, with the notable exceptions of Fiddler on the Roof, Cabaret and Grease.|$|E
2500|$|... "Now, {{people are}} coming back and almost {{adopting}} it as their own anthem, and it's hard, I think, to write an anthem that's not cheesy, and I hope {{that this could be}} something in that category. I hope this could be {{one of those things where}} it's like, 'Yeah, I want to put my fist up and feel proud and feel strong. But I also don't want to be cheesy, it's a fine line, and I think 'Firework' ... would be like the opus or <b>my</b> <b>one</b> song — if I had to pick a song to play — 'cause it has a great beat. But it also has a fantastic message. Many people refer to the lines 'like the 4th of July; however the original lyrics were 'like a firefly' as they reminded me of fireworks at night whenever I saw them. However the trend caught on and in live performances I now sing 4th of July, which happens to make great sense for the song name." ...|$|E
