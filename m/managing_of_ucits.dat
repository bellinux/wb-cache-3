We do not find any conclusive evidence that the less regulated hedge funds outperform alternative Ucits funds on a risk adjusted basis, even though we find some cross-sectional evidence. We also find a significant difference in level of risk between hedge funds and alterna-tive Ucits funds with the latter bearing less risk. This is anticipated due to the limits on risk and leverage under the Ucits regulation...|$|R
