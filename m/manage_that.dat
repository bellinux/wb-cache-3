The ongoing construction took up parking spaces, which spurred the village government to institute valet parking. The parking service has remained since the construction finished. A private contractor has {{an agreement with the}} village for three employees to <b>manage</b> <b>that</b> part of the lot. An additional section of the station parking lot is privately owned. The valet service has no extra charge.|$|E
5|$|Irwin coached Toronto during 1897 and 1898. He faced {{arrest on}} a libel charge in 1898, which stemmed from {{comments}} made by Irwin about {{the actions of the}} Philadelphia ownership during his time there. Though Irwin turned himself in, it appears that he was never arrested. In 1898, Irwin traded some of his best players to the Washington major league team. The moves were seen as particularly suspect when Irwin was named the Washington manager shortly thereafter. After 1899, Irwin did not return to the major leagues as a coach. He returned for a subsequent term as Penn's coach in 1900, but he left in 1902. In August 1902, Irwin was signed as an NL umpire for the remainder of that season. Irwin, who had previously only filled in for one three-day umpiring stretch in 1881, umpired his first NL game on August 7, 1902. His last umpiring appearance came {{with the end of the}} 1902 season on October 3. In fifty games as an umpire, Irwin ejected nine players, including future Hall of Fame inductees Roger Bresnahan and Fred Clarke. Irwin, who had retained partial ownership of the Toronto club, then returned to <b>manage</b> <b>that</b> team for a couple of seasons.|$|E
25|$|Bethel Woods {{operates}} {{the museum and}} offers programs nine months a year. It was hoped that the opening the center will help revive tourism, which has suffered in the region following the closure of many resorts following {{the decline of the}} Borscht Belt. While Sullivan County has struggled, at times, with the legacy of Woodstock, officials hope the museum will help <b>manage</b> <b>that.</b> Bethel is already benefiting from the opening of the performing arts center in 2006, and has led to increased development in the town, along the Route 17B corridor, and in nearby Kauneonga Lake (formerly North White Lake), and is seen as one of the county's larger economic development programs, despite the initial controversy surrounding some of its funding.|$|E

25|$|Following his wife's death, {{he began}} discerning a {{vocation}} {{to join a}} monastery, perhaps in France. One day, while discussing his vocation with the sister of Thomas Hussey, the Bishop of Waterford, a band of ragged boys passed by. She pointed to them, and cried:"What! Would you bury yourself in a cell on the continent rather than devote your wealth and your life to the spiritual and material interest of these poor youths?"After settling his business affairs in 1802, Rice {{devoted his life to}} prayer and charitable work, particularly with the poor and marginalised of Waterford. In 1802, when he established a makeshift school in a converted stable in New Street, Waterford, he found the children were so difficult to <b>manage</b> <b>that</b> the teachers resigned. This prompted him to sell his thriving business to another prominent Roman Catholic merchant, a Mr. Quan, and devote himself to training teachers who would dedicate their lives to prayers and to teaching the children free of charge. Despite the difficulties involved, Edmund's classes were so popular that another temporary school had to be set up on another of his properties, this time in nearby Stephen Street.|$|E
25|$|The 1921 session saw {{a renewed}} {{struggle}} over public education. In the previous session, the far reaching, innovative legislation {{known as the}} “School Code of 1919” was enacted. This act completely reworked public education in Delaware by empowering a state superintendent to set standards, consolidated hundreds of tiny local school districts into countywide districts, established a 180-day school year, and provided for a County board of education to appropriate funding through the county property tax. It was hotly debated then, and only narrowly passed. The opponents were poised to repeal the whole legislation in 1921, but through much effort, proponents managed a compromise, the “School Law of 1921”. It lessened the standards, including the 180-day school year, but most importantly moved the funding from the counties to the state through an income tax. To <b>manage</b> <b>that</b> funding, it replaced the county boards of education with a State board of education and a State School Tax Commissioner. The whole effort was a personal mission of Pierre S. du Pont. He was prominent among those who persuasively argued its passage, {{not only in the}} General Assembly, but in hundreds of small gatherings around the state. And it was his personal $5,000,000 contribution, given over 20 years, which made possible much of the reconstruction of suitable buildings to meet the standards established.|$|E

[...] Turner discusses a moment from the episode where Marge tells her sisters, [...] "Homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's just a very complicated man", after which Homer breaks a plate {{over his head and}} shouts [...] "Wrong!" [...] Turner writes that this [...] "revelatory moment" [...] is illustrative of [...] "several of the best-known aspects of Homer's character: his impulsiveness, his inherent silliness, his evident, even physical stupidity".|$|E

500|$|To {{move forward}} with this unified design, Valve sought a game designer, but found no one {{suitable}} for the job. Instead, Valve decided to create the [...] "cabal", initially a group of six individuals from across all departments that worked primarily for six months straight in six-hour meetings four days a week. The cabal was responsible for all elements of design, including level layouts, key events, enemy designs, narrative, {{and the introduction of}} new gameplay elements relative to the story. The collaboration proved successful, and once the cabal had come to decisions on types of gameplay elements that would be needed, mini-cabals formed from other departments most affected by the choice were formed to implement these elements. Membership in the main cabal rotated, since commitment required created burnout. The cabal produced a 200-page design document detailing nearly every aspect of the game. They also produced a 30-page document for the game's narrative, and hired a writer, novelist Marc Laidlaw, to help <b>manage</b> <b>that</b> script for the game to assure in-game consistency. The soundtrack was composed by Kelly Bailey.|$|E

Many were quick to point to Guardiola's lack of coaching experience, but Cruyff said, [...] "The biggest test for a coach at a team like Barça is the strength to make decisions {{and the ability to}} talk to the press, because they don't help and you have to <b>manage</b> <b>that.</b> After that, it's easy for those who know football.

2500|$|MyFC was {{engineered}} by former football journalist Will Brooks. [...] Brooks initially estimated MyFC's purchase fund at £1,375,000 if 50,000 people were {{to sign up}} as members. All members have voting rights on certain decisions in the club purchased by MyFC and they will collectively <b>manage</b> <b>that</b> club, by making many of the decisions usually made by the manager and others, through a voting system on the MyFootballClub website. However, they do not actually hold any shares. The watershed figure of 50,000 registrations expressing interest in participation was passed on 31 July 2007, {{with a total of}} 53,051 registrations completed at that time. At that point, MyFC began collecting payments from those who had registered as well as any new people who signed up subsequently, opening what MyFootballClub described as [...] "phase 2". [...] Paid-up members would participate in a non-binding vote on takeover preference, with Leeds United initially leading the member voting, followed by Cambridge United and Nottingham Forest.|$|E
