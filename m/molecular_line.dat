5000|$|His {{philosophical}} essay [...] "Is a {{new life}} possible?" [...] co-translated into English has been published as a peer-reviewed essay by the Edinburgh University Press (Deleuze Studies). It {{remains one of the}} most downloaded Deleuze Studies papers since 2013, and is an attempt to present an overview of Deleuze's philosophy through the concept of lines of life. In his dialogues with Claire Parnet, Deleuze asserts that: [...] "Whether we are individuals or groups, we are made of lines" [...] (Deleuze and Parnet 2007: 124). In A Thousand Plateaus (with Guattari), Deleuze calls these kinds of 'lifelines' or 'lines of flesh': break line (or segmental line, or molar line), crack line (or <b>molecular</b> <b>line)</b> and rupture line (also called line of flight) (Deleuze and Guattari 2004a: 22). Luis de Miranda explains the difference between these three lines, how they are related to the 'soul', and how a singular individual or group can arise from the play of the lines. Eventually, he introduces the concept of 'Creal' to develop the Deleuzian figure of the 'Anomal', the so(u)rcerer.|$|E
50|$|Diffuse {{clouds are}} of astronomical {{interest}} because {{they play a}} primary role in the evolution and thermodynamics of ISM. Observation of the abundant atomic hydrogen in 21 cm has shown good signal-to-noise ratio in both emission and absorption. Nevertheless, HI observations have a fundamental difficulty when they are directed at low mass regions of the hydrogen nucleus, as the center part of a diffuse cloud: the thermal width of the hydrogen lines are of the same order as the internal velocities of structures of interest, so cloud components of various temperatures and central velocities are indistinguishable in the spectrum. <b>Molecular</b> <b>line</b> observations in principle do not suffer from this problem. Unlike HI, molecules generally have excitation temperature Tex ≪ Tkin, so that emission is very weak even from abundant species. CO and •OH are the most easily studied candidate molecules. CO has transitions in a region of the spectrum (wavelength < 3 mm) where there are not strong background continuum sources, but •OH has the 18 cm emission, line convenient for absorption observations. Observation studies provide the most sensitive means of detections of molecules with subthermal excitation, and can give the opacity of the spectral line, which is a central issue to model the molecular region.|$|E

It is shown that the shapes of <b>molecular</b> <b>lines</b> are sensitive to details of the cloud structure and evolutionary state and are thus useful in inferring the cloud density, temperature, chemical composition, age, and initial conditions. The calculations have successfully reproduced and explained several observed cloud properties, including abundances of complex molecular species and the apparent depletion of CO in dense cores...|$|R

In these fields, four cloud cores {{were selected for}} closer investigation. The <b>molecular</b> <b>line</b> observations at 13 CO, C 18 O, and N 2 H+ were made with the 20 -m radio telescope in Onsala Space Observatory, Sweden.

The hydrogen column densities were estimated from both the <b>molecular</b> <b>line</b> and the dust continuum observations. Radiative transfer models were created for both the continuum and line data. The <b>molecular</b> <b>line</b> emission maxima were approximately where the dust continuum emission maxima were. The <b>molecular</b> <b>line</b> observations indicate that the studied cores are quite stable and show low turbulence. No clear detections of outflows were found in any of the cores. The column densities estimated from the dust continuum observations were 1 - 5 times the column densities derived from the <b>molecular</b> <b>line</b> observations. The column densities derived from the <b>molecular</b> <b>line</b> observations were also considerably lower than what is expected for protostellar cores. When comparing the masses estimated from the <b>molecular</b> <b>line</b> observations to virial and Bonnor-Ebert masses, the mass estimates were considerably lower and it seems that the cores are not on the verge of collapsing. The column density estimates derived from dust emission, however, are in line with the ones expected from prestellar cores and even {{in the light of the}} <b>molecular</b> <b>line</b> observations, there is no reason to doubt these data.

Towards L 1521 F-IRS, carbon-chain lines of CH 3 CCH (50 - 40), C 4 H (17 / 2 - 15 / 2), and C 3 H 2 (212 - 101) are 1. 5 - 3. 5 times stronger than those towards IRAM 04191 + 1522, and the abundances of the carbon-chain molecules towards L 1521 F-IRS are 2 to 5 {{times higher than}} those towards IRAM 04191 + 1522. Mapping observations of these carbon-chain <b>molecular</b> <b>lines</b> show that in L 1521 F the peak positions of these carbon-chain <b>molecular</b> <b>lines</b> are {{different from each other}} and there is no emission peak towards the VeLLO position, while in IRAM 04191 + 1522 these carbon-chain lines are as weak as the detection limits except for the C 3 H 2 line. The observed chemical differentiation between L 1521 F and IRAM 04191 + 1522 suggests that the evolutionary stage of L 1521 F-IRS is younger than that of IRAM 04191 + 1522, consistent with the extent of the associated outflows seen in the 13 CO (1 - 0) line. The non-detection of the organic <b>molecular</b> <b>lines</b> of CH 3 OH (6 - 2 - 7 - 1 E) and CH 3 CN (60 - 50) implies that the warm (~ 100 K) molecular-desorbing region heated by the central protostar is smaller than ~ 100 AU towards L 1521 F-IRS and IRAM 04191 + 1522, suggesting the young age of these VeLLOs.
