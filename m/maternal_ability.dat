60|$|Now {{the right}} to bear {{children}} without taking a husband could not be confined to women who are superfluous in the monogamic reckoning. There is the practical difficulty that although in our population there are about a million monogamically superfluous women, yet it is quite impossible to say of any given unmarried woman that {{she is one of the}} superfluous. And there is the difficulty of principle. The right to bear a child, perhaps the most sacred of all women's rights, is not one that should have any conditions attached to it except in the interests of race welfare. There are many women of admirable character, strong, capable, independent, who dislike the domestic habits of men; have no natural turn for mothering and coddling them; and find the concession of conjugal rights to any person under any conditions intolerable by their self-respect. Yet the general sense of the community recognizes in these very women the fittest people to have charge of children, and trusts them, as school mistresses and matrons of institutions, more than women of any other type when it is possible to procure them for such work. Why should the taking of a husband be imposed on these women as the price of their right to maternity? I am quite unable to answer that question. I see a good deal of first-rate <b>maternal</b> <b>ability</b> and sagacity spending itself on bees and poultry and village schools and cottage hospitals; and I find myself repeatedly asking myself why this valuable strain in the national breed should be sterilized. Unfortunately, the very women whom we should tempt to become mothers for the good of the race are the very last people to press their services on their country in that way. Plato long ago pointed out the importance of being governed by men with sufficient sense of responsibility and comprehension of public duties to be very reluctant to undertake the work of governing; and yet we have taken his instruction so little to heart that we are at present suffering acutely from government by gentlemen who will stoop to all the mean shifts of electioneering and incur all its heavy expenses for the sake of a seat in Parliament. But what our sentimentalists have not yet been told is that exactly the same thing applies to maternity as to government. The best mothers are not those who are so enslaved by their primitive instincts that they will bear children no matter how hard the conditions are, but precisely those who place a very high price on their services, and are quite prepared to become old maids if the price is refused, and even to feel relieved at their escape. Our democratic and matrimonial institutions may have their merits: at all events they are mostly reforms of something worse; but they put a premium on want of self-respect in certain very important matters; and the consequence is that we are very badly governed and are, on the whole, an ugly, mean, ill-bred race.|$|E

Little is known of how other sources of maternal human capital contribute to her children`s health. This paper investigates the differential returns on child health of three sources of maternal human capital: schooling, cognitive ability and childhood background. Conditional on schooling and mother`s height, we first analyze the effect of <b>maternal</b> cognitive <b>ability</b> on her children`s health. Next, we relax the assumption of mother`s schooling and reasoning ability as predetermined variables and study {{the extent to which}} both returns reflect observed mother`s childhood endowments. We conclude by investigating the importance of mother`s schooling and cognitive ability in enhancing her offspring`s health during first-time motherhood. Results show <b>maternal</b> cognitive <b>ability</b> {{is an important factor in}} improving her children`s health. We find these returns robust to the inclusion of mother`s observed childhood endowments. However, estimates of mother`s schooling drop by 30 percent when we control for these variables. This suggests that unlike mother`s schooling, maternal returns to cognitive ability on child health are less likely to reflect mother`s childhood background. Finally, we find <b>maternal</b> reasoning <b>ability</b> to be an important factor in improving her children`s health in first-time motherhood. Our analysis is based on information gathered in the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS- 1), which administered Raven`s Colored Progressive Matrices, and collected anthropometric outcomes.

50|$|The {{energetics}} of gestation {{and growth}} (EGG) hypothesis offers a direct {{challenge to the}} obstetrical dilemma hypothesis, equating the constraints on gestation and parturition to the energy restrictions of the mother. It {{has been shown that}} using both professional athletes and pregnant women, there is an upper limitation to the amount of energy a woman can produce before it cause deleterious effects: approximately 2.1x their basal metabolic rate. During pregnancy the growing brain mass and length in the neonate correspond to more energy needed to sustain it. This results in a competing balance between the fetus‚Äôs demand for energy and the <b>maternal</b> <b>ability</b> to meet that demand. At approximately 9 months gestation, the fetus‚Äôs energy needs surpasses the mother‚Äôs energy limitation, correlating with the average time of birth. The newly born infant can then be sustained on breast milk, which is a more efficient, less energy demanding mechanism of nutrient transfer between mother and child. Additionally, this hypothesis demonstrates that, contrary to the obstetrical dilemma, an increased pelvic size would not be deleterious to bipedalism. Studying the running mechanics of males and females, it was shown that an increased pelvic size related to neither an increased metabolic nor structural demand on a woman.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the oldest}} breeds of cattle, the Chianina {{originates}} {{in the area of}} the Valdichiana, from which it takes its name, and the middle Tiber valley. Chianina cattle have been raised in the Italian regions of Tuscany, Umbria and Lazio for at least 2200 years. Columella, writing about types of oxen in about 55 AD, says [...] "Umbria vastos et albos ..." [...] (VI.I.2), which in the first English translation is [...] "Umbria has such as are huge, and of a white colour". Chianina oxen were the principal source of agricultural power in the area until displaced by mechanisation and the collapse of the mezzadria system following the Second World War; they were in use in agriculture until at least 1970 and are still used in processions such as the corteo storico of the Palio di Siena. From 1931 breeders began to favour selection of animals more suited to meat production, with shorter limbs, longer bodies and more heavily muscled rump and thighs; recently, selection is based also on factors such as growth rate, meat yield and, in cows, <b>maternal</b> <b>ability.</b> While one source reports a herdbook dating from 1856, others date the institution of the Libro Genealogico ("genealogical herdbook") to 1933, when a breed standard was established and commissions were set up by the then Ministero dell'Agricoltura e delle Foreste (ministry of agriculture and forestry) to identify, mark and register morphologically suitable animals; the standard of the Chianina breed was fixed by ministerial decree of 7 August 1935. A private register was previously kept by the largest cattle breeder of the Sienese Valdichiana, the Eredi del conte Bastogi of Abbadia di Montepulciano, and a group of breeders had in 1899 formed a society, the Societ√† degli Agricoltori della Valdichiana (society of farmers of the Valdichiana), of which a principal aim was the establishment of a herdbook.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} weaning {{is related to}} a {{critical}} or threshold body weight attained by offspring among large-bodied mammals; the anthropoid primates, ungulates and pinnipeds. While weaning weight was allometrically related to maternal weight in interspecific comparisons, it was isometrically related to neonatal weight. When a neonate had grown to four times its birth weight it was weaned. Differences between taxonomic groups were found only among the fasting phocids, where weanlings attained a lower, but proportional, weight. The duration of lactation was only weakly allometrically related to maternal or neonatal weight, and varied between individuals intraspecifically {{as a function of}} maternal condition. The time to weaning appears to be ecologically sensitive rather than to reflect interspecific life-history variation, in that, irrespective of the time to weaning, similar proportional weights appear to be attained.

40|$|Optimization of {{selection}} of beef breeds for suckling herds is little developed withm the European Economic Community (E. E. C.) {{because of the}} small proportion of suckling cows and the very different systems of management of the latter.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to gain {{knowledge}} about the genetic background of different aspects of <b>maternal</b> <b>ability</b> in sows. Today‚Äôs selection for increased litter size at birth will put higher demands on the sow‚Äôs ability {{to take care of}} her litter, and may cause problems with increasing piglet mortality and decreasing piglet growth.

The studied traits are different measures of piglet mortality, piglet birth weight, piglet growth, sow behaviour and sow body condition. Both direct genetic effects and maternal genetic effects influenced traits measured on the piglet. The maternal effect was more important than the direct effect for all traits measured prior to weaning. Piglet birth weight was favourably genetically correlated to survival of live born piglets. However, we found unfavourable genetic correlations between stillbirth and birth weight of the piglet. This indicates that selection for increased birth weight is not a recommendable strategy to improve piglet survival at birth.

There is less research, however, on which factors contribute to the parents 2 ÃÜ 7 use of positive parenting strategies. Some evidence suggests that factors such as the parents 2 ÃÜ 7 emotional competencies, along with the child 2 ÃÜ 7 s temperament and the family environment, influence parenting behaviors (Belsky, 1984). This study explored predictors of positive parenting, including maternal emotion expressivity and emotion regulation, child temperament traits, <b>maternal</b> cognitive <b>ability,</b> <b>maternal</b> perception of social support, and single parenting. Participants were 104 African-American, at-risk young mothers and their children. Positive parenting was observed during a mother-child semi-structured play task, and coded using the Parenting Interactions with Children: Checklist of Observations Leading to Outcomes (PICCOLO; Roggman et. al). It was expected that the PICCOLO would demonstrate strong scale validity and reliability for this sample. It was hypothesized that mothers 2 ÃÜ 7 emotion expressivity and regulation would predict their use of positive parenting behaviors. An exploratory hypothesis also predicted that mothers 2 ÃÜ 7 emotion skills would moderate the relation between child temperament traits and the PICCOLO domains. Multiple regression and hierarchical linear regressions were used to conduct statistical analyses. Maternal emotion expressivity and regulation were not significant predictors of positive parenting, when controlling for child temperament, <b>maternal</b> cognitive <b>ability,</b> single parenting, and maternal perception of support. One exception was that the reported strength of the mothers 2 ÃÜ 7 emotional expressions was negatively associated with the total PICCOLO score.

40|$|Background Maternal {{smoking in}} {{pregnancy}} lowers birthweight. It is unclear, however, whether smoking during pregnancy lowers offspring IQ, and, if it does, {{whether it is}} through the smoking effect on fetal growth. Method Representative samples of low birthweight (, 2500 g) and normal birthweight children born in 1983 ‚Äì 85 from inner-city and suburban communities in southeast Michigan, USA were assessed at ages 6, 11, and 17, using Wechsler intelligence tests. Smoking during pregnancy was ascertained from mothers at the first assessment; and smoking at any time was ascertained at the first and second assessment. Generalized estimating equation models were used, with children‚Äôs IQ at all three assessments as outcomes (n 5 798). Results Without adjustment, offspring of mothers who smoked during pregnancy scored 6. 8 IQ points lower than offspring of mothers who never smoked, on average. Low birthweight children scored 5. 4 IQ points lower than normal birthweight children, on average. The statistical association of maternal smoking with offspring IQ was confounded by maternal characteristics, chiefly, <b>maternal</b> cognitive <b>ability</b> as measured by IQ and education; adjustment for these factors eliminated the association. By contrast, adjustment for maternal IQ and education as well as smoking during pregnancy had a negligible effect on the low birthweight-related IQ deficit. Low birthweight did not mediate the association of smoking and lowered IQ in offspring.

An extra day (per month) of time-investment by a typical visiting father enhances child health by just over 10 % of a standard deviation. This estimate is not biased by the effect of child health on father-involvement or omitted <b>maternal</b> <b>ability,</b> thereby eliminating endogeneity biases that plague existing studies. The result has implications regarding the role of a father's time in enhancing child health, especially in fragile families...|$|E
40|$|Research on kidding {{ability of}} ewes had been {{conducted}} at Singorojo, Kendal Resident. The {{aim of the}} research was to find out a <b>maternal</b> <b>ability</b> of ewes giving a birth more than two kids (n = 26 head). The sample was chosen by using purposive randomized sampling. Result showed that there was no significantly difference between sample and both single and twins, based on body weight. body height, body length, chest width, chest depth, facial profile, hip hair and udder shape. Characteristic of facial profile, hip hair and udder shape of sample found showed that there was difference between sample goats and both Kacang and Ettawah Crossbred Goats at 3 head (11, 54...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Newborn‚Äôs first {{approach}} to the world {{takes place in the}} relationship with his/her mother. He/she builds his/her-own experiences from mother's repertoire of facial expressions, voices, gestures. Contemporarily, the process of becoming mother entails a wide range of changes, which may lead to psychopathology conditions, among which post-partum depression is the most common. This disease is known to negatively influence <b>maternal</b> <b>abilities</b> and produce feelings of greater struggle in caring the infant, sense of guilty and poor self-efficacy. Motor development represents the principal field of observation in helping to infer infant's needs, feelings and intentions. Its investigation may be a powerful means to understand the influence of maternal attitudes (e. g. depressive-symptoms) on infant motor-development. Aims of the study: The main aim of this research was to investigate the characteristics of motor- development in infants aged 1 - 11 months, and if/how maternal depressive-symptomatology may influence infant's motor-development during his/her first year of life. Material&Methods: Data were collected within the wider Italian-validation-project of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale-II (PDMS- 2). Participants included 123 infants (1 - 11 months old) with their mothers. Infants were tested with PDMS- 2 and mothers‚Äô symptomatology was screened with SCL- 90 -TR and CES-D. All dyads belong to non-clinical population. We calculated correlational- and regression-analysis between PDMS- 2,SCL- 90 and CES-D. Results: The best predictor of infants‚Äô motor-performance is the age in months. Perceived maternal somatization negatively predicted infants‚Äô Fine-Motor-scores. On the contrary, positive correlations were found between depressive perceived symptoms, InterpersonalSensitivity, Hostility and Paranoid Ideation and infants Gross- Motor abilities, especially Locomotion. Conclusions: Results suggest that mother's perceived symptoms influence the ability of the infant to move trough the space, while perceived levels of somatization negatively predict his/her fine- motor development. Age-in-months is the most accurate predictor of motor-performance. Further analyses are needed to better understand relationship between maternal-symptomatology and infant motor-skills...|$|R
40|$|About half of 2, 581 low-income mothers {{reported}} reading {{daily to}} their children. At 14 months, {{the odds of}} reading daily increased by the child being fi rstborn or female. At 24 and 36 months, these odds increased by <b>maternal</b> verbal <b>ability</b> or education and by the child being fi rstborn or of Early Head Start status. White mothers read more than did Hispanic or African American mothers. For English-speaking children, concurrent reading was associated with vocabulary and comprehension at 14 months, and with vocabulary and cognitive development at 24 months. A pattern of daily reading over the 3 data points for English-speaking children and daily reading at any 1 data point for Spanish-speaking children predicted children‚Äôs language and cognition at 36 months. Path analyses suggest reciprocal and snowballing relations between maternal bookreading and children‚Äôs vocabulary...|$|R
40|$|Failure {{to thrive}} and {{insufficient}} milk are common reasons given for terminating breast-feeding early. Mothers often doubt their natural ability to successfully suckle a young infant. This perceived inadequacy may be reinforced by health professionals who advise supplemental formula feeds to ensure rapid weight gain before an accurate diagnosis has been made. The growth of healthy infants depends on maternal milk production, milk transfer at the breasts, and {{the quantity and}} quality of milk intake by the baby. Problems with any one of these areas can present as failure to thrive. The author focuses on a diagnostic approach to failure to thrive in a breast-fed infant and outlines ways to assess <b>maternal</b> lactation <b>ability,</b> milk production, milk transfer, and milk intake. The diagnosis of failure to thrive is often simple and follows sound physiological and anatomical principles...|$|R
