40|$|Rapeseed samples {{collected}} from different processing stages {{were obtained from}} one commercial crushing plant for the present investigation. The samples included (A) whole seeds, (B) flaked seeds, (C) press cakes, (D) solvent extracted meal, (E) desolventized meal and (F) cooled, desolventized meal. Frozen and/or glycol met hacrylate-embedded sections of the samples were examined using the techniques of fluorescence microscopy. Mechanical crushing tended to disrupt cell walls. After cooking and expeller pressing, individual protein bodies fused to form large masses encompassing phytin containing globoids. Storage lipids also coalesced into larger droplets. Most of the oil was removed after solvent extraction and was absent inside cotyledon cells after desolventization. The final meal product contained primarily hull and cotyledon fragments. The cotyledon fragments consisted of an amorphous protein matrix embedded with phytingloboids and supported by a network of broken cell walls. The structural and microchemical organization of the hull were not much affected by the processing. Phenolic compounds, <b>mucilage,</b> <b>cell</b> wall poly saccharides, chlorophyll, storage proteins and lipids could be detected by various fluorescence microscopic techniques...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} leaf anatomy {{was undertaken}} on some Coelostegia species (C. griffithii, C. borneensis and C. chartacea) and also Ceiba pentandra Gaertn. (Bombacaceae) as an outgroup species. The study includes transverse section of laminas and margins using sliding microtome. Leaf clearing was made using Basic Fuchsin in 10 % of KOH. The presence of <b>mucilage</b> <b>cell,</b> types of trichomes, types of laminar venation, presence of schlerenchyma cells and druses {{are common in}} all species studied. All Coelostegia species studied, have a unique characteristic in which solitary crystal is present exactly on above vascular bundles touching the adaxial epidermal and forms a structure-like girder. Coelostegia species can be distinguished by the margin outline, types of venation and in {{the presence or absence}} of trichomes. This study also showed that there were seven characters that can be used to differentiate between Coelostegia and Ceiba pentandra. The characters were swollen tracheid on the leaf laminar venation, pattern of vascular bundle in the petiole and midrib, the presence and types of crystal, the presence and types of trichomes, mucilagenous canals, hypodermis, collenchyma and schlerenchyma in the medullary vascular bundle in the petiole and in the leaf lamina. This study showed that the combination of anatomical characteristics has taxonomic value that can be useful for distinguishing species...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and distribution}} patterns of oil and/or <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells,</b> i. e. idioblasts, in the leaf of 37 Annona species are described. Idioblasts are always {{present in the}} spongy parenchyma in all species {{and in most cases}} also in the palisade parenchyma. Usually both oil <b>cells</b> and <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> occur; in some species either oil or mucilage idioblasts are present. Their number ranges from few to abundant Both idioblast types possess a suberized wall layer. <b>Mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> are significantly larger than oil cells. The distribution patterns of oil and/or <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> often do not coincide with the current classification into sections. Leaf features such as lamina thickness, the presence of sclereids in the mesophyll, crystals in the adaxial epidermis, hairs, an adaxial hypodermis, a thickened cuticle and the presence of a papillate abaxial epidermis and sunken stomata are compared with the distribution of oil and <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells.</b> Following an analysis of the systematic value of oil and <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> it is concluded that combinations and frequencies of oil and <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> are often useful in species identification, and sometimes indicate relationships between species. In general, the significance of oil and <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> as phylogenetic markers is extremely limited as shown in tentative cladistic analyses of leaf anatomical characters...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and distribution}} patterns {{of oil and}} <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> in the leaf of 150 species of Cinnamomum are described. Idioblasts are always present in the palisade and the spongy parenchyma. Usually both oil and <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> occur; in some species either oil or <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> are present. Both types of idioblasts possess a suberized wall layer. The idioblasts vary between species in size/ shape, stainability and number. Variations in the distribution pattern can partly {{be explained by the}} proposed homology of the oil and <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells.</b> Other leaf anatomical characters are also mentioned, such as lamina and cuticle thickness, bundle sheath extensions, sclerification of the epidermal, the palisade, and the spongy parenchyma cells, number of palisade layers, presence or absence of a hypodermis, the indumentum and papillate abaxial epidermal cells, and the venation pattern. Most species differ from each other in only one or few leaf anatomical characters (including oil and <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells).</b> A great many combinations in character distribution were observed. However, the distribution pattern in approximately one-fifth of all studied species deviated largely from the typical leaf anatomical character distribution pattern occurring in the majority of Cinnamomum species. There was a maximum of seven differing features out of the sixteen features studied. Within this group almost all neotropical Cinnamomum species are included. The latter species lack sclerified epidermal cells and almost all have penninerved instead of the generally occurring triplinerved leaves. Cluster analyses based on all leaf anatomical features studied revealed that the distribution patterns of the oil and <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> play a significant part in the grouping of the species. Therefore oil and <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> possess at least some diagnostic value within the genus Cinnamomum. The systematic significance of oil and <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> at the infrageneric level remains uncertain for lack of a detailed infrageneric classification of Cinnamomum for comparison with the idioblast distribution patterns...|$|R

Freyn and Sint. ex Iljin, have studied. Except of A. angulata that <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> {{observed}} both in epidermis and mesophyll of leaves, in the others <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> confined to epidermis cells. All of species have <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> in the petals. The area of the mucilaginous elements in the leaves and petals of species determined planimetrically on definite cross-sections was studied as a comparative element to the mucilage content determined by extracting the raw mucilage by Hot Extraction Method (HEM) and then by comparing the dry weight, comparison between species was done. A correlation between the greater area of the mucilaginous elements and the mucilage content measured by methods mentioned was shown, basing on different microscopic examination of cross-sections of the organs fixed and stained with ruthenium red. The results were shown that mucilage content in the leaves of Malva neglecta {{was more than the}} others and mucilage content in petals of Malva neglecta was more than the others...|$|R
40|$|In some plant species, {{including}} Arabidopsis, fertilization induces the epidermal {{cells of}} the outer ovule integument to differentiate into a specialized seed coat cell type with a unique morphology and containing large quantities of polysaccharide mucilage (pectin). Such seed coat <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> are necessary for neither viability nor germination under normal laboratory conditions. Thus, the Arabidopsis seed coat offers a unique system with which to use genetics to identify genes controlling cell morphogenesis and complex polysaccharide biosynthesis and secretion. As {{a first step in}} the application of this system, we have used microscopy to investigate the structure and differentiation of Arabidopsis seed coat <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells,</b> including cell morphogenesis and the synthesis, secretion, and extrusion of mucilage. During seed coat development in Arabidopsis, the epidermal {{cells of the}} outer ovule integument grow and differentiate into cells that produce large quantities of mucilage between the primary cell wall and plasma membrane. Concurrent with mucilage production, the cytoplasm is shaped into a column {{in the center of the}} <b>cell.</b> Following <b>mucilage</b> secretion the cytoplasmic column is surrounded by a secondary cell wall to form a structure known as the columella. Thus, differentiation of the seed coat <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> involves a highly regulated series of events including growth, morphogenesis, mucilage biosynthesis and secretion, and secondary cell wall synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Members {{of the genera}} Hieracium and Pilosella are model {{plants that}} are used to study the {{mechanisms}} of apomixis. In order to have a proper understanding of apomixis, knowledge about the relationship between the maternal tissue and the gametophyte is needed. In the genus Pilosella, previous authors have described the specific process of the "liquefaction" of the integument cells that surround the embryo sac. However, these observations were based on data only at the light microscopy level. The main aim of our paper was to investigate the changes in the integument cells at the ultrastructural level in Pilosella officinarum and Hieracium alpinum. We found that the integument peri-endothelial zone in both species consisted of <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells.</b> The <b>mucilage</b> was deposited as a thick layer between the plasma membrane and the <b>cell</b> wall. The <b>mucilage</b> pushed the protoplast to the centre of the cell, and cytoplasmic bridges connected the protoplast to the plasmodesmata through the mucilage layers. Moreover, an elongation of the plasmodesmata was observed in the <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells.</b> The protoplasts had an irregular shape and were finally degenerated. After the cell wall breakdown of the <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells,</b> lysigenous cavities that were filled with mucilage were formed...|$|R
50|$|Dictyopteridium is an {{elongate}} leaf like structure adnate to {{the upper}} surface of ordinary-appearing leaves of Glossopteris. It bore numerous ovules on its lower side which was folded over and filled with <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells.</b> Pollen still {{found its way into}} the pollen chambers of these protected seeds, and fertilization was by means of motile sperm with helical cilial bands.|$|R
50|$|Urticalean {{families}} span a {{wide range}} of morphological features—deciduous or evergreen trees, vines, shrubs, annuals and some succulents. Leaves also vary though they tend to share brochidodromous or palmately pinnate venation, often associated with lobing or compounding in the leaf blade. Among Moraceae, Urticacae and Cecropiaceae, <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> and latex production is common. However, Cannabaceae, Ulmaceae, and Celitdaceae do not produce this material despite the presence of laticifers.|$|R
40|$|Leaf {{structure}} of the three southern African genera of Icacinaceae was examined by light and scanning electron microscopy. Diagnostic characters include the stoma and trichome type, and lamina characters, such as <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells,</b> pectic warts and ‘unidentified cell inclusions’. In southern Africa both Cassinopsis Sond. and Pyrenacantha Hook. have cyclocytic stomata, {{as opposed to the}} anomocytic type of Apodytes E. Mey. Ex Arn. The presence of a stomatal ridge in A. dimidiata is a useful character in separating this species from the other two southern African members of this genus. A peristomal rim in Cassinopsis tinifolia Harv. and its absence in C. ilicifolia (Hochst.) Kuntze allow the separation of these two species. The indumentum of Pyrenacantha consists of simple (unmodified), ‘globular’ and ‘uncinate’ trichomes, whereas that of Apodytes and Cassinopsis consists of simple hairs. <b>Mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> were found only in members of Apodytes. Intercellular, predominantly wart-like pectic protuberances are present in the mesophyll of mature leaf samples of A. geldenhuysii Van Wyk & Potgieter and Cassinopsis. Small, irregularly shaped, yellowish cell inclusions were found subepidermally to the abaxial epidermis in C. ilicifolia. Their chemical composition and function (if any) is still unknown...|$|R
40|$|In the {{mesophyll}} of Teucrium polium L. leaves, isolated or grouped idioblastic secretory cells {{occur in}} contact with the distal (adaxial) vessel elements of the vascular bundles. They appear to originate from one or more bundle sheath cells and their intracellular space is entirely occupied by the secretory material. The latter has a glycoproteinaceous constitution (mucilage), as histochemical tests showed. Idioblastic cells, therefore, correspond to typical <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells.</b> <b>Mucilage</b> seems to {{play a crucial role in}} the adaptation of the plant to unfavourable environmental conditions...|$|R
50|$|The species {{assigned}} to the Crossosomatales have in common that the flowers are positioned solitary, with {{the base of the}} calyx, corolla, and stamens fused into a tube-shaped floral cup, the sepals overlapping, with the outermost smaller than inner ones. The inside of the casings of the pollen grains have horizontally extended thin regions (or endo-apertures). The gynoecium is placed on a short stalk, the papillae on the stigma consist of two or more cells, the ovary locules taper upwards, and the protective cell layer (or integument) surrounding the ovule leaves a zigzag opening (or micropyle). Some cell clusters have bundles of long yellow crystals, <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> are present, and seeds have a smooth, woody seed skin.|$|R
40|$|A new {{epiphyllous}} Lejeuneaceae genus, Papillolejeunea is described. It is a segregate of Lejeunea, {{characterized by}} a large, 2 - 4 celled, stout, papilla like first (distal) tooth on a well developed, inflated lobule, while the second (proximal) tooth is reduced, blunt, hidden with the usually involuted free lobule margin. Four new species are described within the genus. One, Papillolejeunea balazsii, forms the Section nov. Papillolejeunea {{and the type of}} the genus, characterized by large number of serially arranged <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> on the dorsal surface and margin of the lobe, at the margin of amphigastria and on the perianth keels. Three further species, Papillolejeunea candida, Papillolejeunea papuana and Papillolejeunea touwii constitute the Section nov. Candidae, where no such dorsal and marginal glands occur.

40|$|Hardwickia mopane (mopane) leaves {{collected}} in the Northern Province (South Africa), Zimbabwe, Botswana, Malawi and Namibia {{have been used in}} a comparative study of leaflet and petiole anatomy. Morphological and anatomical features of leaflets and petioles collected from dwarf mopane and woodland mopane in the Messina area, South Africa was also compared. The material represents a wide range of habitats, environmental conditions and growth forms. For the anatomical investigations, use was made of cleared leaves, resin sections, light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy Features such as leaf movement, bundle sheath anatomy, presence of epidermal <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells,</b> stress metabolites and terpenoids are related to drought stress and predation.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{determine}} what happens with plasmodesmata when mucilage is secreted into the periplasmic space in plant cells. Ultrastructural analysis of the periendothelial zone <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> was performed on examples of the ovule tissues of several sexual and apomictic Taraxacum species. The cytoplasm of the periendothelial zone cells was dense, filled by numerous organelles and profiles of rough endoplasmic reticulum and active Golgi dictyosomes with vesicles that contained fibrillar material. At {{the beginning of the}} differentiation process of the periendothelial zone, the cells were connected by primary plasmodesmata. However, during the differentiation and the thickening of the <b>cell</b> walls (<b>mucilage</b> deposition), the plasmodesmata become elongated and associated with cytoplasmic bridges. The cytoplasmic bridges may connect the protoplast to the plasmodesmata through the mucilage layers in order to maintain cell-to-cell communication during the differentiation of the periendothelial zone cells...|$|R
40|$|Pollination {{triggers}} {{not only}} embryo development {{but also the}} differentiation of the ovule integuments to form a specialized seed coat. The <b>mucilage</b> secretory <b>cells</b> of the Arabidopsis thaliana seed coat undergo a complex differentiation process in which cell growth {{is followed by the}} synthesis and secretion of pectinaceous mucilage. A number of genes have been identified affecting <b>mucilage</b> secretory <b>cell</b> differentiation, including MUCILAGE-MODIFIED 4 (MUM 4). mum 4 mutants produce a reduced amount of mucilage and cloning of MUM 4 revealed that it encodes a UDP-L-rhamnose synthase that is developmentally up-regulated to provide rhamnose for mucilage pectin synthesis. To identify additional genes acting in mucilage synthesis and secretion, a screen for enhancers of the mum 4 phenotype was performed. Eight mum enhancers (men) have been identified, two of which result from defects in known <b>mucilage</b> secretory <b>cell</b> genes (MUM 2 and MYB 61). Our results show that, in a mum 4 background, mutations in MEN 1, MEN 4, and MEN 5 lead to further reductions in mucilage compared to mum 4 single mutants, suggesting that they are involved in mucilage synthesis or secretion. Conversely, mutations in MEN 2 and MEN 6 appear to affect mucilage release rather than quantity. With the exception of men 4, whose single mutant exhibits reduced mucilage, none of these genes have a single mutant phenotype, suggesting that they would not have been identified outside the compromised mum 4 background...|$|R

The achene surface sculpture in Artemisia is determined by the complexes of <b>mucilage</b> containing <b>cells</b> located in the exocarp. Significant variation of pericarp surface sculpture was revealed in the species with wide distribution area – A. arctica and A. furcata. It is determined that Artemisia is rather uniform in its achene surface structure. None of the distinguished types of the achene surface structure is characteristic to any particular section or subgenus. <b>Mucilage</b> containing <b>cell</b> complexes are not a character of the genus, since similar cell complexes are typical for some other taxa of the tribe Anthemideae as well. However, the details of the sculpture discovered by means of SEM are good additional characters for identification of some species or particular groups of species...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{concerning}} the ultrastructure of the periendothelial zone integumentary cells of Asteraceae species arescarce. The {{aim was to}} check whether and/or what kinds of integument modifications occur in Onopordum acanthium. Ovule structure was investigated using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and histochemistry. For visualization of calcium oxalate crystals, the polarizing microscopy was used. The periendothelial zone of integument in O. acanthium is well developed and composed of <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> near the integumentary tapetum and large, highly vacuolated cells at the chalaza and therefore they differ from other integumentary cells. The cells of this zone lack starch and protein bodies. Periendothelial zone cells do not have calcium oxalate crystals, in contrast to other integument cells. The disintegration of periendothelial zone cells was observed in a mature ovule. The general ovule structure of O. acanthium is similar to {{other members of the}} subfamily Carduoideae, although it is different to “Taraxacum”, “Galinsoga” and “Ratibida” ovule types...|$|R
40|$|Theobroma {{species have}} {{economic}} importance {{due to their}} use in the cosmetic and food industries, mainly {{in the production of}} chocolate. However, the anatomy of their vegetative structures remains poorly studied. The goal {{of this study was to}} describe the anatomical features of Theobroma grandiflorum, T. speciosum and T. subincanum to contribute to the biological knowledge of these species, as well as provide support to the biotechnological studies of native fruit plants of the Amazon. Leaves at different developmental stages were collected and analyzed under light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Sessile and stalked stellate trichomes and digitiform glandular trichomes were observed in the expanded leaves of T. grandiflorum and T. subincanum. These species were also similar in the morphology of the midrib, the organization of the mesophyll and the presence of starch grains in the midrib pith cells. Claviform glandular trichomes and <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> in the epidermis occurred only in the expanded leaves of T. speciosum.

A publicly available microarray database was screened with expression visualization tools, and was complemented by in-lab microarray experiments between wild type and known MSC mutants to identify candidate cell wall genes highly expressed at the time of <b>mucilage</b> synthesis. Several <b>cell</b> wall genes were also chosen based on their putative functions which would implicate them in mucilage synthesis. Phenotyping of mutant lines obtained for the cell wall candidate genes revealed no abnormal mucilage phentoypes in single or select double mutant lines.

Anatomical differences in terms of thickness of cuticle, vascular bundle, xylem and phloem were analyzed in both normal and fasciated stems. The <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> {{were higher in the}} fasciated form of Opuntia microdasys than that in the normal form. Water status in terms of total water content (TWC), water deficit and relative water content (RWC) was influenced by fasciation. Genetic variations were tested in normal and fasciated stems using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprints and SDS-PAGE of soluble protein extracts. SDS-PAGE protein and RAPD analysis confirmed that normal and fasciated tissues were genetically different. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) yielded different polymorphic banding patterns that were unique to each primer and distinguishable over all samples. The PCR results of normal and fasciated samples were significantly different in cases of primers P 1, P 2 and P 3. These results indicate that occurrence of fasciation in Opuntia microdasys, Opuntia cylindrica, Huernia primulina and Euphorbia lactea is an epigenetic mutation of tissues...|$|R

During development of heteromorphic leaves, epidermal appendages (wax crystals and trichomes) and special <b>cells</b> (<b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> and crystal idioblasts) increased in all leaf types while chloroplast ultrastructure and stomatal characters show maximum photosynthetic activity in dentate ovate and rhombic leaves. Also, functional analysis by subordinate function values shows that the maximum adaptability to adverse stress was exhibited in the broad type of mature leaves. The 12 heteromorphic leaf types are classified into three major groups by hierarchical cluster analysis: young, developing and mature leaves. Mature leaves can effectively obtain the highest stress resistance by combining the protection of xerophytic anatomy from drought stress, regulation of water uptake in micro-environment by mucilage and crystal idioblasts, and assistant defense of transpiration reduction through leaf epidermal appendages, which improves photosynthetic activity under arid desert conditions.

Diversity in stomatal type, midrib and petiole vascularisation, sclerenchyma support, foliar sclereids, <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells,</b> secretory cavities, and cristarque cells provide evidence in favour of a separate family status {{of the members of the}} Linaceae complex.

Irvingiaceae (often treated in or near Simaroubaceae) show similarities with the Linaceae complex, albeit more closely to the Hugoniaceae than to the Ixonanthaceae to which they have been transferred by some authors. Ctenolophon seems unrelated, but leaf anatomy gives no strong clues for its true affinities. Lepidobotrys may be related to the Linaceae complex, but its leaf anatomy is also in good agreement with treatment in or near the Oxalidaceae. Within the Ixonanthaceae, Phyllocosmus deserves generic status next to Ochthocosmus on account of the exclusive occurrence of tracheoidal idioblasts in the latter and lack thereof in the former.

40|$|ABSTRACT Floral {{secretory}} {{structures are}} {{usually associated with}} the attraction of pollinators, but may also {{play an important role}} in the mechanisms of plant protection. This study aimed to show the diversity of secretory structures present in the developing flowers of 15 legume species belonging to different clades and to associate them with functions other than the pollinator attraction. Buds, flowers and developing axis of inflorescence were processed for surface, histological, and ultrastructural analyses. The species investigated displayed a wide diversity of secretory structures in developing flowers such as phenolic cells and/or tissues, mucilaginous cells, secretory cavities, secretory trichomes and colleters. Each type of secretory structure exhibited variation in morphology and location in the flower and/or axis of inflorescence depending on the species. Special <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells,</b> secretory cavities, secretory trichomes and colleters have great potential for comparative morphological studies due to their diversity of forms or restricted occurrence to certain taxa, contributing to a more robust morphological data base for the new clades emerging in Leguminosae. The scarcity of reports about floral secretory structures of Leguminosae seems to be more related to deficient sampling than to the absence of such structures in the group, which highlights the need for further investigation...|$|R

Potential synapomorphies for Chrysobalanaceae s. l. are the following shared features: floral cup; flowers obliquely monosymmetric; sepals congenitally united at base; sepals of unequal size (outer two shorter); fertile stamens concentrated on the anterior side of the flower and sometimes united into a strap; staminodes absent in the posteriormost antepetalous position; anthers extremely introrse, with thecae almost in one plane; endothecium continuous over the dorsal side of the connective; dorsal anther pit; gynoecium completely syncarpous up to the stigma; carpel flanks slightly bulged out transversely and thus carpels demarcated from each other by a longitudinal furrow; flowers with dense unicellular, non-lignified hairs, especially on the gynoecium; light-coloured, dense indumentum on young shoots and inflorescences. Potential synapomorphies for Chrysobalanaceae[*]+[*]Euphroniaceae include: spur in floral cup; clawed petals; lignified hairs on petals; nectary without lobes or scales and mostly annular. Potential synapomorphies for Dichapetalaceae[*]+[*]Trigoniaceae include: special <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells</b> in sepals in mesophyll (in addition to epidermis); anthers almost basifixed; gynoecium synascidiate up to lower style; nectary with lobes or scales and semi-annular...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{combination}} of review and original data on floral structure and diversity in the two earliest diverging lineages of the Ericales, i. e. the balsaminoids, comprising Balsaminaceae, Marcgraviaceae and Tetrameristaceae, and the polemonioids, comprising Fouquieriaceae and Polemoniaceae. Each clade is strongly supported in molecular studies, while structural synapomorphies have largely been lacking. For the balsaminoid families, we compare floral morphology, anatomy and histology among selected taxa and find that the entire clade is strongly supported by the shared presence of nectariferous tissue in the floral periphery, thread-like structures on anthers, truncate stigmas, secretion in the ovary, as well as <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells,</b> raphides and tannins in floral tissues. A possible sister group relationship between Balsaminaceae and Tetrameristaceae is supported by the shared presence of post-genital fusion of filaments and ovary and a star-shaped stylar canal. For polemonioids, we document unexpected diversity of floral features in Polemoniaceae, partly providing structural links to Fouquieriaceae. Features include cochlear and quincuncial corolla aestivation, connective protrusions, ventrifixed anthers and nectariferous tissue in the base of the ovary. In addition, we outline future directions for research on floral structure in the Ericales and briefly discuss the general importance of structural studies for our understanding of plant phylogeny and evolution...|$|R
40|$|Following pollination, the {{epidermal}} {{cells of}} the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ovule undergo a complex differentiation process that includes the synthesis and polar secretion of pectinaceous mucilage followed by {{the production of a}} secondary cell wall. Wetting of mature seeds leads to the rapid bursting of these <b>mucilage</b> secretory <b>cells</b> to release a hydrophilic gel that surrounds the seed and is believed to aid in seed hydration and germination. A novel mutant is identified where mucilage release is both patchy and slow and whose seeds display delayed germination. While developmental analysis of mutant seeds reveals no change in <b>mucilage</b> secretory <b>cell</b> morphology, changes in monosaccharide quantities are detected, suggesting the mucilage release defect results from altered mucilage composition. Plasmid rescue and cloning of the mutant locus revealed a T-DNA insertion in AtBXL 1, which encodes a putative bifunctional β-d-xylosidase/α-l-arabinofuranosidase that has been implicated as a β-d-xylosidase acting during vascular development. Chemical and immunological analyses of mucilage extracted from bxl 1 mutant seeds and antibody staining of developing seed coats reveal an increase in (1 → 5) -linked arabinans, suggesting that BXL 1 is acting as an α-l-arabinofuranosidase in the seed coat. This implication is supported by the ability to rescue mucilage release through treatment of bxl 1 seeds with exogenous α-l-arabinofuranosidases. Together, these results suggest that trimming of rhamnogalacturonan I arabinan side chains is required for correct mucilage release and reveal a new role for BXL 1 as an α-l-arabinofuranosidase acting in seed coat development...|$|R
40|$|Anatomy of Brazilian Cereeae (subfamily Cactoideae, Cactaceae) : Arrojadoa Britton & Rose, Stephanocereus A. Berger wâBrasilicereus Backeberg). Arrojadoa, Stephanocereus and Brasilicereus are endemic Brazilian Cereeae, {{occurring}} {{along the}} Espinhaço Range, in the campos rupestres, cerrados and caatingas, from northern Minas Gerais to southern Bahia. The genera are columnar, erect to semi-erect cacti, {{except for one}} species, A bahiensis, which is globose. This study describes the anatomy of dermal, fundamental and vascular systems, aiming to find diagnostic characters for the genera and species. Basal portions of stems were sectioned transversely and longitudinally, and stained with Astrablue and Safranin. The species share a uniseriate epidermis, with thick cuticle; well developed collenchymatic hypodermis, containing prismatic crystals; cortex with numerous <b>mucilage</b> <b>cells,</b> druses and vascular bundles; outside cortex as a palisade parenchyma; periderm composed of lignified cork cells alternating with suberized cells; pheloderm consisting of a few layers of thin-walled cells; phloem composed of solitary or multiple of two to three sieve tube elements, companion cells, axial and radial parenchyma; secondary xylem with solitary to multiple vessels, with simple perforation plates and alternate bordered to semi-bordered pits; axial parenchyma scanty vasicentric to incomplete; libriform septate fibres; large rays. Unlignified parenchyma {{is seen in the}} secondary xylem, varying from a few cells to bands among axial and radial elements. The following are considered diagnostic characters: the shape of lignified phellem cells, cubic to radially elongate, which individualizes S. leucostele; an underdeveloped hypodermis and the occurrence of sclereids in the cortex are exclusive to Brasilicereus markgrqfii...|$|R
5000|$|Pandorina is a genus {{of green}} algae {{composed}} of 8, 16, or sometimes 32 cells, held together at their bases {{to form a}} sack globular colony surrounded by <b>mucilage.</b> The <b>cells</b> are ovoid or slightly narrowed at one end to appear keystone- or pear-shaped. Each cell has two flagella with two contractile vacuoles at their base, an eyespot, and a large cup-shaped chloroplast {{with at least one}} pyrenoid. [...] The colonies co-ordinate their flagellar movement to create a rolling, swimming motion. Pandorina shows the beginnings of the colony polarity and differentiation seen in Volvox since the anterior cells have larger eyespots. Molecular sequencing has shown that Pandorina is paraphyletic with respect to Volvulina.|$|R
