5|$|Joe Shea got up {{and started}} calmly with {{a report on the}} state of the investigation. But within a <b>minute,</b> <b>he</b> was rambling, and in another thirty seconds, he was incoherent. I looked at him and saw my father, in the grip of {{dementia}} praecox. It was horrifying and fascinating at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Symes was loaned to League Two Burton Albion on 31 January 2013, {{until the}} end of the season. He made his debut two days later, away to bottom-placed AFC Wimbledon, and {{equalised}} for a 1–1 draw in the 36th <b>minute.</b> <b>He</b> scored 4 goals in 15 appearances as the team made the play-offs, being eliminated by his former employers Bradford.|$|E
5|$|Bent {{made his}} first {{appearance}} of 2010–11 in the opening match, a 2–2 draw with Birmingham City on 14 August and opened the scoring with a penalty in the 24th <b>minute.</b> <b>He</b> scored the winning goal with stoppage time penalty as Sunderland beat Manchester City 1–0 on 29 August. Bent scored the equaliser during stoppage time to earn Sunderland a 1–1 draw against Arsenal on 18 September. He then scored twice in Sunderland's 2–2 draw at Liverpool.|$|E
50|$|Santos can {{memorize}} a shuffled deck {{of cards}} in three <b>minutes.</b> <b>He</b> can also remember 100 new faces and names in 15 <b>minutes.</b> <b>He</b> remembered 24 new faces and names in under five minutes {{in an interview with}} NBC News.|$|R
2500|$|... at 28:25 {{minutes and}} 32:15 <b>minutes</b> <b>he</b> talks about Rendlesham.|$|R
60|$|After {{playing the}} fish {{for nearly five}} <b>minutes</b> <b>he</b> reeled him in rapidly.|$|R
5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per <b>minute.</b> <b>He</b> {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. This ability to move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after doing long periods of aerobatics.|$|E
5|$|In December 1964, Baxter played brilliantly {{to set up}} a 2–0 win for Rangers in an away {{game against}} Rapid Vienna in the European Cup. With the game won, rather than play out time Baxter's {{confidence}} over-extended into arrogance to make fun of his opponents with the ball. In the last <b>minute</b> <b>he</b> went to 'nutmeg' an opponent, who was having none of it and broke Baxter's leg with his challenge. This was to be a watershed for Baxter. During the four months in which he was unable to play he began drinking to his detriment; this ultimately was to curtail his playing career and his life.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} season in the Portuguese capital, Gauld scored his first goal of the B-team's {{campaign}} on 26 August 2015, {{the only one of}} the away match at S.C. Covilhã in the 84th <b>minute.</b> <b>He</b> followed this on 12 September with a strike in a 4–0 triumph at Oriental. Gauld matched his goal tally in Segunda Liga from the previous season on 3 October, when he opened a 1–1 draw at FC Famalicão, and succeeded it on 28 November with his fourth goal of the campaign, assuring the same result at Gil Vicente F.C.|$|E
60|$|He {{sighed and}} closed his eyes. In a few <b>minutes</b> <b>he</b> was asleep.|$|R
60|$|At the end {{of another}} silent ten <b>minutes,</b> <b>he</b> rose to his feet.|$|R
60|$|Kit {{gave him}} a cigar, {{but after a few}} <b>minutes</b> <b>he</b> threw it away.|$|R
5|$|Marquinhos {{began the}} 2014–15 season on 2 August in the Trophée des Champions, playing the whole 90 minutes as PSG won 2–0 against Guingamp at the Workers Stadium in Beijing. In the 32nd <b>minute,</b> <b>he</b> gave away a penalty kick by fouling Claudio Beauvue, but Salvatore Sirigu saved the penalty shot from Mustapha Yatabaré. His first {{goal of the}} season came in a 2–0 win at Caen on 24 September, heading in Javier Pastore's corner.|$|E
5|$|Pogba {{made his}} Premier League debut against Stoke City on 31 January 2012, {{replacing}} Javier Hernández in the 72nd <b>minute.</b> <b>He</b> made another substitute appearance against West Bromwich Albion on 11 March. Four days later, {{he made his}} European debut in the second leg of the team's UEFA Europa League round of 16 tie against Spanish club Athletic Bilbao; he appeared as a substitute in the 2–1 away defeat, coming on for Michael Carrick in the 63rd minute as Manchester United lost the tie 5–3 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|The same {{cauldron}} {{was used}} as in the 1932 Summer Games. The orchestra played The Olympian composed and conducted by Philip Glass. The torch enters the stadium carried by Rafer Johnson, he completes a lap as mechanical steps rise {{from the center of}} the peristalses. He climbs the stairs and stands and faces the crowd as The Olympian is still being played. After a <b>minute,</b> <b>he</b> lights the gas powered Olympic rings that connect with the Olympic cauldron. The flame is lit to the cheers from the crowd. The athlete and judges oaths are taken and a children's chorus appears. They perform ode to joy.|$|E
60|$|Meeks hurried away. In twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>he</b> {{was back}} again, with a beaming face.|$|R
50|$|On January 19, 2008, Mark Jackson from Altrincham, UK, {{flew over}} Kilimanjaro. In doing so {{he broke the}} record for the highest {{altitude}} attained in a microlight, 24262 ft, and the fastest climb to 20000 ft (25 <b>minutes).</b> <b>He</b> also broke the British record for the fastest climb to 10000 ft (19 <b>minutes).</b> <b>He</b> did the flight with Eve Jackson.|$|R
60|$|After sitting {{thinking}} {{for a few}} <b>minutes</b> <b>he</b> called to Pierre, who was sitting outside.|$|R
5|$|Tonelli {{retired after}} the Games. His aquatic success was not derived from any {{physical}} advantage, {{as he was}} relatively small for a swimmer. He was only 185cm tall and weighed 70kg, with relatively small hands and feet. Tonelli felt that his success was based around his ability to make fast starts from the blocks, and attributed his success to his mental approach {{and his ability to}} convert his energy into a fast swim in under one <b>minute.</b> <b>He</b> had a deliberate strategy of making himself nervous before the race, feeling that he thrived on pressure.|$|E
5|$|Torres {{made his}} first {{appearance}} of the 2010–11 season in the opening match, a 1–1 draw with Arsenal on 14 August 2010, entering the game as a substitute in the 74th <b>minute.</b> <b>He</b> scored his first goal {{of the season with}} the winner in a 1–0 victory over West Brom on 29 August 2010, his 50th goal at Anfield in all competitions. Torres scored the winning goal in a 2–1 victory at home to Blackburn Rovers on 24 October 2010, his first goal since August. He scored his final goals for Liverpool in a 3–0 win away at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 22 January 2011.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 97,952, Albion {{took the lead in}} the first half when Clive Clark scored in the 7th <b>minute.</b> <b>He</b> scored again later in the half to give Albion a 2–0 lead at half-time. QPR reduced the deficit in the 63rd minute when Roger Morgan scored and then {{levelled}} the match 12 minutes later courtesy of a goal by Rodney Marsh. Mark Lazarus scored a third goal for QPR in the 81st minute, as QPR won the match 3–2 to win the League Cup for the first time.|$|E
60|$|His head ached greatly, and {{for several}} <b>minutes</b> <b>he</b> could not {{remember}} what had happened.|$|R
60|$|In a few <b>minutes</b> <b>he</b> {{had reached}} the General, and thrown himself from his saddle.|$|R
60|$|Snagsby hesitated and went. Within five <b>minutes</b> <b>he</b> reappeared with {{a handful}} of buff-covered papers.|$|R
5|$|After {{his success}} in Belgium with Gent, Mido signed a five-year {{contract}} with Eredivisie team Ajax in 2001. He suffered a concussion during their UEFA Cup match with Limassol, after colliding with a defender. He made his return for the team against Heerenveen, a match which Ajax lost 5–1. However, he was sent off against Twente, after kicking Spira Grujić whilst trying to beat him to the ball, {{for which he was}} later given a three-match ban. He returned for Ajax against Vitesse, coming on as a substitute in the 75th <b>minute.</b> <b>He</b> failed to be selected for the substitutes bench against Feyenoord in March 2002, which was due to a minor clash with manager Ronald Koeman, and Mido left for a short vacation in Cairo. Mido scored in Ajax's victory over Utrecht in the KNVB Cup final, meaning he ended the 2001–02 season with the Dutch League and Cup double.|$|E
5|$|Carruthers {{made his}} first {{appearance}} of 2010–11 in the opening match, a 2–1 home defeat to Kidderminster Harriers on 14 August 2010, {{in which he was}} substituted in the 65th <b>minute.</b> <b>He</b> suffered a knee injury in a 3–0 home victory over Altrincham on 28 August 2010 and it was believed this would keep him out of the team for a month. Carruthers made his return as an 81st-minute substitute in a 2–0 victory away to Kidderminster in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round on 23 October 2010. His first start since August 2010 came in a 3–0 home victory over League Two club Rotherham United in an FA Cup first round replay on 17 November. He scored his first goal of the season in the 87th minute of a 2–1 defeat away to Darlington on 23 April 2011. His season finished with 29 appearances and 1 goal and was released by York on 23 June 2011.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro {{began his}} 2015 season with wrist pain {{and was not}} sure whether he would play Sydney and the Australian Open. However, at the last <b>minute</b> <b>he</b> decided to play both tournaments. He had not played a tournament since February 2014, but he started the 2015 Apia International Sydney with a straight-sets win against Sergiy Stakhovsky. In the second round, his {{opponent}} was world No. 19 and top seed Fabio Fognini. It was a tough test for del Potro, but he proved to be stronger than the Italian. Del Potro was through to the quarterfinals, but lost to Mikhail Kukushkin in two tiebreakers. After his Sydney campaign, {{he was drawn to}} play Jerzy Janowicz {{in the first round of}} the 2015 Australian Open, del Potro withdrew due to his wrist injury. Del Potro played in Miami and was not seen for nearly a year, undergoing surgery again in June 2015.|$|E
60|$|And for {{the space}} of several <b>minutes</b> <b>he</b> lay there, quiet, indulging his {{grotesque}} fancy.|$|R
60|$|Poirot hopped down briskly, {{and went}} inside. In a few <b>minutes</b> <b>he</b> was back again.|$|R
60|$|For {{some twenty}} <b>minutes</b> <b>he</b> {{remained}} there smacking his thighs, his shoulders heaving with glee.|$|R
5|$|Following Martyn Woolford's {{departure}} from York, Brodie {{played on the}} left wing in the 1–0 away victory over Crawley Town on {{the opening day of}} the season. His first goal of the season came after being assisted by Simon Rusk in a 2–2 away draw with Northwich Victoria. After coming on as a substitute in the 68th <b>minute,</b> <b>he</b> was sent off in the 76th minute of a 3–1 away defeat against Wrexham on 7 October 2008, after initially being shown a yellow card for kicking the ball away and then receiving a second card for a tackle on Carl Tremarco, which resulted in him being suspended for York's match against Woking.|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas {{started in}} {{the centre of the}} front three of a 4–3–3 {{formation}} against Italy in Spain's opening Group C match, essentially acting as a false 9. In the 64th <b>minute</b> <b>he</b> scored the equaliser after Italy had taken the lead in the 61st minute; the game finished in a 1–1 draw. He then scored his second goal of the tournament in the next group stage match against Ireland, which ended in a 4–0 win to Spain. When Spain faced Portugal in the semi-finals and the game remained scoreless at the end of extra time, Fàbregas scored the winning penalty of the shootout as Spain prevailed 4–2. In the final against Italy, Fàbregas started and provided the assist to David Silva for the game's opening goal, en route to a 4–0 Spain victory.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May 2010, Fahey won {{his first}} senior cap for the Republic of Ireland in a 2–1 win against Paraguay at the RDS Arena, {{replacing}} Damien Duff in the 77th <b>minute.</b> <b>He</b> made his first start against Argentina on 12 August, in the first international match at the new Aviva Stadium. Fahey scored his first goal for the Republic of Ireland eight minutes into his competitive debut, coming off the bench to score the only goal in a Euro 2012 qualifying win over Armenia in Yerevan on 3 September 2010. On his first competitive start, in a 1–1 draw against Slovakia in Zilina on 12 October, Fahey delivered the free kick that led to Ireland's goal, scored by Sean St. Ledger. In February 2011, he scored his second goal for Ireland in a 3–0 defeat of Wales in the 2011 Nations Cup, and his third came in March 2011, a penalty against Uruguay.|$|E
