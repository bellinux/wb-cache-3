5|$|In the post-apocalyptic environment, {{ammunition}} is a {{rare and}} essential commodity. Pre-apocalypse, <b>military-grade</b> ammunition is used as currency. Players can avoid consuming all the valuable currency by using lower quality bullets made within the Metros. Due to the scarcity of ammunition, a crucial aspect of gameplay is scavenging. The player can loot corpses and the environment for spare ammunition, as well as weapons and other items. The <b>military-grade</b> ammunition {{can be used to}} purchase other ammunition, weapons, and items within most of the Metro stations. Weapon attachments, such as scopes and silencers, which improve weapon efficiency, can be purchased with these bullets.|$|E
5|$|Large {{stockpiles}} of weapons-grade plutonium were built up {{by both the}} Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War. The U.S. reactors at Hanford and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina produced 103tonnes, and an estimated 170tonnes of <b>military-grade</b> plutonium was produced in the USSR. Each year about 20tonnes of the element is still produced as a by-product of the nuclear power industry. As much as 1000tonnes of plutonium may be in storage with more than 200tonnes of that either inside or extracted from nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|The first {{policeman}} {{to arrive}} on the scene noticed wires running from the van's dashboard through a hole into the back and {{reported that he had}} found the bomb. Forensic experts later estimated that the bomb weighed 1,500–1,600 kg (3,300–3,500 lb) and was a mixture of semtex, a <b>military-grade</b> plastic explosive, and ammonium nitrate fertiliser, a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA. Components of what may have been a tremble trigger were also found later, designed to detonate the bomb if it was tampered with.|$|E

The ACU and its component materials are manufactured by the existing industrial infrastructure which produced the now-obsolete BDU. Official <b>military-grade</b> ACUs are made of 50% nylon and 50% cotton. All other blends are not official issue.|$|E
25|$|Rifle Scopes to Russia: On September 11, 2008, a Grand Jury in the Middle District of Pennsylvania indicted Boris Gavrilov, D Compas Ltd, and Kiflet Arm {{on charges}} of {{illegally}} exporting <b>military-grade</b> and dual-use rifle scopes to Russia without the required U.S. government licenses. Gavrilov {{is believed to be}} a resident of Israel. D Compas is located in Israel, while Kiflet Arm is located in Humboldt, Texas. Extradition proceedings for Gavrilov have commenced.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{there was}} much {{confused}} information from police sources as to the origin, method, and even timings of the explosions. Forensic examiners had thought initially that <b>military-grade</b> plastic explosives were used, and, as the blasts were {{thought to have been}} simultaneous, that synchronised timed detonators were employed. This hypothesis changed as more information became available. Home-made organic peroxide-based devices were used, according to a May 2006 report from the British government's Intelligence and Security Committee. The explosive was triacetone triperoxide.|$|E
25|$|Set in {{the near}} future Germany, it portrays hideous demonic being called Demoniacs or Amalgams on the prowl on German soil attacking civilians and were said to be from the dead. The Bundezpolizei {{establishes}} an anti-Demoniac unit called the Xenogenesis Assault Team, armed with <b>military-grade</b> weapons and equipment to protect the German populace from Demoniacs and to spearhead anti-Demoniac operations. Individuals who are able to control the Demoniac powers and use them to fight against them on their own terms or to destroy the world are called Blassreiters.|$|E
25|$|Soichiro {{seems to}} be a sword expert: he prefers to use the sword instead of his wife's Luger P08 pistol and has trained with Saeko Busujima's father. Later he entrusts Saeko with a katana made with <b>military-grade</b> steel at an {{industrial}} weapons factory. When the zombies breach the estate, he and his troops fight them off. He tells Takashi Komuro to go save Rei's parents, and entrusts Kouta Hirano with protecting Saya. While the Takagis {{and the rest of the}} estate survivors fight against the horde, Soichiro comments that they are proud of their daughter and the friends she has made.|$|E
25|$|The game {{takes place}} in Pacific City, a dystopian {{metropolis}} that was suffering from an increase in crime rate. Criminal syndicates namely the Los Muertos, Volk, and Shai-Gen have taken control of many of its territory, and they are armed with <b>military-grade</b> weapons that {{made it difficult for}} law enforcement to combat them. A secret organization known as the Agency took it upon themselves to eliminate the city's organized crime using their wide resources and genetically modified human beings called Agents. The Agent successfully brought down each criminal syndicates but it was later found out that it was the Agency itself who supplied the criminals with weapons. They planned for the city to go down in anarchy so that they can step in, stop the criminals and be hailed heroes when they themselves take over.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the fourth}} edition, skill and ability checks worked as follows: all {{actions in the}} game, {{from the use of}} skills to making attacks in combat, are first given a target number that {{reflects}} the difficulty of the action which is then raised or lowered by various modifying factors, such as environmental conditions, the condition of the character, the use of mechanical aids, and so forth. The player then rolls a number of dice equal to their level in the relevant skill, and the number of dice rolled that meet or exceed the target number determines if the character is successful performing the action and the degree of success the character has. As an example, a character with a high firearms skill not only has a better chance at hitting a target than someone with a lower ranked skill, but also is more likely to cause more damage to the target. Target numbers may exceed 6, in which case any dice that show a 6 have to be re-rolled (a target number of, e.g., 9 is reached by rolling a 6 followed by at least a 3; thus, a target number of 6 and one of 7 are identical, except extra dice rolls are not allowed for target number 7 or greater). For even higher target numbers, this procedure has to be repeated; thus, an action with a target number of 20 (like attempting to procure <b>military-grade</b> weaponry) will only succeed if three successive dice rolls result in sixes, and the fourth gives at least a 2. For any dice-roll a roll of 1 always counts as a failure. This system allows great flexibility in setting the difficulty of an action.|$|E

He gives Jenna a <b>military-grade</b> experimental drug currently being tested on rats to stay awake. At the same time, Tracy believes that having enough money to pay FCC fines means that he can say anything on television, and he says to Liz, [...] "I can even say what Ernest Borgnine whispered to me." [...] As a result, Tracy curses on The Martha Stewart Show, and after learning that the show's advertisers are pulling out, due to his actions, decides to sponsor the show. Meanwhile, Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, Jack Donaghy, desperately tries to find a name for a pocket microwave oven that is not offensive in any language. With Liz gone, Jack assigns the TGS writing staff, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell), J. D. Lutz (John Lutz), Josh Girard (Lonny Ross), and Sue LaRoche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway), to this task.

2500|$|Forerunners of the Israeli Air Force {{were the}} Palestine Flying Service {{established}} by the Irgun in 1937, and Sherut Avir, the air wing of the Haganah. The Israeli Air Force formed on May 28, 1948, shortly after Israel declared statehood and found itself under attack. The force consisted of a hodge-podge of commandeered or donated civilian aircraft converted to military use. A variety of obsolete and surplus ex-World War II combat-aircraft were quickly sourced by various means to supplement this fleet. The backbone of the IAF consisted of 25 Avia S-199s (purchased from Czechoslovakia, essentially Czechoslovak-built Messerschmitt Bf 109s), and 60 Supermarine Spitfire LF Mk IXEs, the first of which, [...] "Israel 1" [...] was locally assembled from British abandoned spare parts and a salvaged engine from an Egyptian spitfire {{with most of the}} rest purchased from Czechoslovakia. Creativity and resourcefulness were the [...] foundations of early Israeli military success in the air, rather than technology (which, at the inception of the IAF, was generally inferior to that used by Israel's adversaries). The majority, 15 out of the first 18 pilots in 101 Squadron (Israel), of the IAF's first <b>military-grade</b> pilots in 1948 were foreign volunteers (both Jewish and non-Jewish), mainly World War II veterans who wanted to collaborate with Israel's struggle for independence, {{with the rest of the}} <b>military-grade</b> pilots being Israeli WWII veterans, whereas pilots from Sherut Avir were mainly locals who flew light civilian aircraft for supply, reconnaissance, and makeshift ground attack with hand-thrown light bombs and hand fired light machine guns.|$|E
