5|$|Weizsäcker {{worked for}} <b>Mannesmann</b> between 1950 and 1958, as a {{scientific}} assistant until 1953, as a legal counsel from 1953, and {{as head of the}} department for economic policy from 1957. From 1958 to 1962, he was head of the Waldthausen Bank, a bank owned by relatives of his wife. From 1962 to 1966, he served {{on the board of directors}} of Boehringer Ingelheim, a pharmaceutical company.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} work {{was carried out}} by over 5,000 workers, mostly German engineers drafted in from several companies including <b>Mannesmann,</b> Gute Hoffnungshütte, Krupp and the Vereinigte Stahlwerke, supplemented by 430 miners recruited from the Ruhr and Soviet prisoners of war who were used as slave labourers. The intensive Allied bombing campaign caused delays, but {{construction work}} continued nonetheless at a high pace underground. The original plans had envisaged having the first battery of five guns ready by March 1944 and the full complement of 25 guns by 1 October 1944, but these target dates were not met.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mannesmann</b> mills {{can produce}} tubes {{as large as}} 300mm (12in) in diameter.|$|E
25|$|Rotary {{piercing}} is a {{hot working}} metalworking process for forming thick-walled seamless tubing. There are two types: the <b>Mannesmann</b> process and Stiefel process.|$|E
25|$|The Stiefel {{process is}} very similar to the <b>Mannesmann</b> process, except that the convex rollers are {{replaced}} with large conical disks. This allows for larger tubes to be formed.|$|E
25|$|Although the Zeitschrift {{was never}} revived, the Institute {{nevertheless}} published {{a series of}} important sociological books, including Sociologica (1955), a collection of essays, Gruppenexperiment (1955), Betriebsklima, a study of work satisfaction among workers in <b>Mannesmann,</b> and Soziologische Exkurse, a textbook-like anthology intended as an introductory work about the discipline.|$|E
25|$|From 1969 to 1980, <b>Mannesmann</b> Demag and MBB cooperated {{to build}} the Cabinentaxi urban {{transportation}} system in Germany. Together the firms formed the Cabintaxi Joint Venture. They created an extensive PRT technology that was considered fully developed by the German government and its safety authorities. The system {{was to have been}} installed in Hamburg, but budget cuts stopped the proposed project before the start of construction. With no other potential projects on the horizon, the joint venture disbanded, and the fully developed PRT technology was never installed. Cabintaxi Corporation, a US-based company, obtained the technology in 1985, and remains active in the private-sector market for transportation systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{fortress}} of Bu Njem, which had only captured from its Ottoman garrison in 1914, was the forward Italian {{post in the}} Sirtica. The interior was either evacuated (Waddan, Hun and Suknan) or its posts left to isolated garrisons besieged by the Senussi and Bedouin. The Senussi objective of expelling the Italians, coincided with Ottoman war aims. In 1914, the British chose to appease the Senussi but the accession of Italy to the entente in May 1915 led to the British applying pressure to the Senussi to recognise the Italian occupation and stopping cross-border trade. The Senussi became more dependent on German and Ottoman imports and had to move to find food. The attempt by <b>Mannesmann,</b> a German agent, to fabricate a diplomatic incident on 15 August failed but the economic crisis caused by the British embargo pushed the Senussi towards war. The Ottoman sultan appointed Sayed Ahmed the governor of Tripolitania and Ahmed published the caliphal decree of jihad against the infidel British and their allies.|$|E
500|$|U-156 {{along with}} U-502 again {{departed}} from Lorient {{under the protection}} of a pathfinder on 22 April 1942 destined for the Caribbean Sea. Prior to the departure Dietrich von dem Borne, who had been severely wounded on the second patrol, was replaced by Oberleutnant zur See of the Reserve Gert <b>Mannesmann.</b> Chief engineer Wilhelm Polchau reported to Hartenstein on 6 May that the diesel compressor had malfunctioned. Hartenstein radioed [...] under the command of Robert-Richard Zapp to assist. On 10 May U-156 and U-66 rendezvoused and exchanged [...] of fuel oil for the necessary spare parts, and the fuel compressor was repaired. U-156 sighted the first steamer in the early afternoon on 12 May, the first of twelve ships—eleven merchantmen and one warship—attacked on this patrol, ten of which were sunk.|$|E
2500|$|CK Hutchison {{group has}} the {{reputation}} of being an astute asset trader. It [...] builds up new businesses and sells them off when shareholder value could be created. Huge profits were obtained in the sale of its interest in Orange to <b>Mannesmann</b> Group in 1999, making a profit of $15.12billion. In 2006 Li sold 20% of Hutchison's ports business to Singapore rival PSA Corp., making a $3.12billion profit on a $4billion deal.|$|E

The company designed, developed and produced digital typesetting systems: Scantext 1000, launched in 1981 and Scantext 2000, launched in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990, {{following}} {{the liberalization of}} the German telecommunications market, <b>Mannesmann</b> {{set up a new}} business sector and established Germany's first cellular network carrier in private ownership known as D2 <b>Mannesmann.</b> The network company was called <b>Mannesmann</b> Mobilfunk GmbH. It was the main competitor to Germany's incumbent carrier, Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile, also known as D1.Additionally, <b>Mannesmann</b> extended its telecommunications division with integrated services covering mobile and fixed network telephony, Internet, and TeleCommerce with companies in Germany, Italy, UK and Austria ...|$|E
50|$|The Europe-wide {{telecommunication}} {{branch of}} <b>Mannesmann</b> was extraordinarily successful {{and so in}} 1999 the <b>Mannesmann</b> Group hatched a plan to spin off the other divisions. Through a stock exchange flotation {{under the name of}} <b>Mannesmann</b> Atecs AG, these industrial divisions were to be combined in a separate enterprise that {{would be one of the}} largest companies listed in the German stock index DAX.However, before these plans could materialize, a historic takeover battle lasting several months ended with the acquisition of <b>Mannesmann</b> by the British mobile phone company Vodafone in 2000. On 4 February 2000 Mannesmann’s supervisory board eventually agreed to a takeover price of 190 billion €, which was the largest takeover price ever paid until that date and still is the highest.The telecommunications division of <b>Mannesmann</b> was subsequently incorporated into the Vodafone Group. The other divisions were resold to various companies soon after the deal. The origins of <b>Mannesmann,</b> the pipe production activities of Mannesmannröhren-Werke AG, were sold to Salzgitter AG along with the brand name <b>Mannesmann.</b>|$|E
50|$|In October 1999 the German {{conglomerate}} <b>Mannesmann</b> AG acquired Orange {{for a price}} {{equivalent to}} €7,900 per customer, i.e. US$33 billion. Mannesmann's acquisition of Orange triggered Vodafone to make a hostile takeover bid for <b>Mannesmann.</b> Shortly thereafter, in February 2000, Vodafone acquired <b>Mannesmann</b> for US$183 billion, and decided to divest Orange because the EU regulations wouldn't allow it to hold two mobile licences.|$|E
50|$|In 1973 the {{ownership}} of Demag was assumed by the <b>Mannesmann</b> group, based in Düsseldorf. In 1983 Mannesmann-Demag AG and Wean United, Inc. of Pittsburgh, United States, founded a daughter company to produce steel working equipment, <b>Mannesmann</b> Demag Wean Co.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, {{the company}} was {{acquired}} by <b>Mannesmann.</b> In 1999, <b>Mannesmann</b> was itself acquired by Vodafone and VDO was put up for sale. In 2000, {{the company was}} acquired by Siemens AG, Germany's biggest engineering company, and re-branded as Siemens VDO.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mannesmann</b> was a German {{industrial}} conglomerate. It {{was originally}} {{established as a}} manufacturer of steel pipes in 1890 under the name [...] "Deutsch-Österreichische Mannesmannröhren-Werke AG". (Loosely translated: [...] "German-Austrian <b>Mannesmann</b> pipe mills AG"). In the twentieth century, Mannesmann’s product range grew and the company expanded into numerous sectors - starting from various steel products and trading to mechanical and electrical engineering, automotive and telecommunications. From 1955, the conglomerate’s management holding with headquarters in Düsseldorf was named <b>Mannesmann</b> AG.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the terms}} of the {{takeover}} deal, <b>Mannesmann</b> sought assurances from Vodafone that the <b>Mannesmann</b> brand and name would be kept under the new owners.This was agreed and the deal was announced. However, not long after this, Vodafone reneged on the deal and rebranded.|$|E
5000|$|In November 1999, Vodafone made an {{unsolicited}} bid for <b>Mannesmann,</b> {{which was}} rejected. Vodafone's interest in <b>Mannesmann</b> had been increased {{by the latter}} purchase of Orange, the UK mobile operator. Chris Gent would later say Mannesmann's move into the UK broke a [...] "gentleman's agreement" [...] not to compete in each other's home territory. The hostile takeover provoked strong protest in Germany, and a [...] "titanic struggle" [...] which saw <b>Mannesmann</b> resist Vodafone's efforts. However, on 3 February 2000, the <b>Mannesmann</b> board agreed to an increased offer of £112 billion, then the largest corporate merger ever. The EU approved the merger in April 2000 when Vodafone agreed to divest the 'Orange' brand, which was acquired in May 2000 by France Télécom.|$|E
50|$|Original {{majority}} owner Olivetti {{sold its}} interest in Omnitel and Infostrada to the German consortium <b>Mannesmann</b> (which {{had been a}} minority shareholder since 1997) after Olivetti's took control of Telecom Italia, and thus TIM, in 1999. <b>Mannesmann</b> took control of Omnitel with a 53.7% equity stake.|$|E
