500|$|A {{significant}} indirect {{influence was}} Thomas Simpson, who achieved {{a result that}} closely resembled de Moivre's. According to Simpsons' work's preface, his own work depended greatly on de Moivre's; the latter in fact described Simpson's work as an abridged version of his own. Finally, Thomas Bayes wrote an essay discussing theological implications of de Moivre's results: his solution to a problem, namely that of determining the probability of an event by its relative frequency, was taken as a proof {{for the existence of}} God by Bayes. Finally in 1812, Pierre-Simon Laplace published his Théorie analytique des probabilités in which he consolidated and laid down many fundamental results in probability and statistics such as the <b>moment</b> <b>generating</b> <b>function,</b> method of least squares, inductive probability, and hypothesis testing, thus completing the final phase in the development of classical probability. [...] Indeed, in light of all this, there is good reason Bernoulli's work is hailed as such a seminal event; not only did his various influences, direct and indirect, set the mathematical study of combinatorics spinning, but even theology was impacted.|$|E

We demonstrate how to analytically solve the evolution equations for all six elementary types of single-species chemical reactions by either combinatorial normal-ordering techniques, or, for the binary reactions, {{by means of}} Sobolev-Jacobi orthogonal polynomials. The former set of results in particular highlights the relationship between infinitesimal generators of stochastic evolution and parametric transformations fo probability distributions.
