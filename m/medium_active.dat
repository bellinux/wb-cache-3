50|$|When the {{nitric acid}} {{concentration}} is high the extraction into the organic phase is favoured, {{and when the}} nitric acid concentration is low the extraction is reversed (the organic phase is stripped of the metal). It is normal to dissolve the used fuel in nitric acid, after {{the removal of the}} insoluble matter the uranium and plutonium are extracted from the highly active liquor. It is normal to then back extract the loaded organic phase to create a <b>medium</b> <b>active</b> liquor which contains mostly uranium and plutonium with only small traces of fission products. This <b>medium</b> <b>active</b> aqueous mixture is then extracted again by tributyl phosphate/hydrocarbon to form a new organic phase, the metal bearing organic phase is then stripped of the metals to form an aqueous mixture of only uranium and plutonium. The two stages of extraction are used to improve the purity of the actinide product, the organic phase used for the first extraction will suffer a far greater dose of radiation. The radiation can degrade the tributyl phosphate into dibutyl hydrogen phosphate. The dibutyl hydrogen phosphate can act as an extraction agent for both the actinides and other metals such as ruthenium. The dibutyl hydrogen phosphate can make the system behave in a more complex manner as it tends to extract metals by an ion exchange mechanism (extraction favoured by low acid concentration), to reduce the effect of the dibutyl hydrogen phosphate it is common for the used organic phase to be washed with sodium carbonate solution to remove the acidic degradation products of the tributyl phosphate.|$|E

What is more, the simulation results show that the gas <b>active</b> <b>medium</b> need lower population inversion to bunch the electrons compared to the solid <b>active</b> <b>medium.</b> So the experimental condition is easy to be achieved...|$|R
