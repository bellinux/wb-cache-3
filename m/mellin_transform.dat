40|$|In this article, we use <b>Mellin</b> <b>transforms</b> {{to derive}} {{alternative}} results for option pricing and implied volatility estimation when the underlying asset price {{is governed by}} jump-diffusion dynamics. The current well known results are restrictive since the jump is assumed to follow a predetermined distribution (e. g., lognormal or double exponential). However, the results we present are general since we do not specify a particular jump-diffusion model within the derivations. In particular, we construct and derive an exact solution to the option pricing problem in a general jump-diffusion framework via <b>Mellin</b> <b>transforms.</b> This approach of <b>Mellin</b> <b>transforms</b> is further extended to derive a Dupire-like partial integro-differential equation, which ultimately yields an implied volatility estimator for assets subjected to instantaneous jumps in the price.

40|$|At {{the tree}} level, the maximally {{helicity}} violating amplitudes of N gauge bosons in open superstring theory and of N gravitons in supergravity {{are known to}} have simple representations in terms of tree graphs. For superstrings, the graphs encode integral representations of certain generalized Gaussian hypergeometric functions of kinematic invariants while for supergravity, they represent specific kinematic expressions constructed from spinor-helicity variables. We establish a superstring/supergravity correspondence for this class of amplitudes, by constructing a mapping between the positions of gauge boson vertices at the disk boundary and the helicity spinors associated to gravitons. After replacing vertex positions by a larger set of N(N- 3) / 2 coordinates, the superstring amplitudes become (multiple) <b>Mellin</b> <b>transforms</b> of supergravity amplitudes, from the projective space into the dual Mellin space of N(N- 3) / 2 kinematic invariants.
