New calculations have been made and a band pass filter constructed to match the new values. Work on the cathode-follower circuit for coupling a Boron-wall tube to its linear amplifier indicated that the limit to the sharpness of a pulse which could be achieved was possibly caused by poor amplitude versus frequency response of the linear amplifier.
