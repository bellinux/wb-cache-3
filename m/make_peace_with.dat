5|$|All of Sigismund's {{attempts}} to <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the sultan failed. He sent his envoys to Prague {{to negotiate with}} RudolphII, while his confessor, Carillo, started negotiations with Jan Zamoyski in Poland. At Sigismund's invitation, his cousin, Andrew Báthory, returned from Poland. Sigismund abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (now Mediaș in Romania) on 21March 1599. Eight days later, the Diet proclaimed Andrew Báthory prince, hoping that Andrew could <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the Ottomans {{with the assistance of}} Poland. Sigismund left Transylvania for Poland in June. His marriage with Maria Christierna was declared invalid in Rome in August.|$|E
5|$|Having {{defeated}} the last immediate threat to Macedon, Philip returned to diplomacy. He released the Athenian prisoners immediately, and sent ambassadors to Athens. He {{was prepared to}} abandon all claim to Amphipolis, and this, coupled with his treatment of the Athenian prisoners, persuaded the Athenians to <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Proceeding {{down the}} Mediterranean coast, the crusaders {{encountered}} little resistance, as local rulers preferred to <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> them and furnish them with supplies rather than fight, with a notable {{exception of the}} abandoned siege of Arqa. On 7 June, the crusaders reached Jerusalem, which had been recaptured from the Seljuqs by the Fatimids only the year before. Many Crusaders wept upon seeing the city they had journeyed so long to reach.|$|E

5|$|After the Ottomans {{defeated}} {{the armies of}} the Holy League {{in a series of}} battles in 1596, Transylvanian noblemen sent letters to Andrew, offering him the principality. After realizing that neither the pope nor the Polish king would support him against Sigismund Báthory, Andrew declared that he was ready to <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> him. He returned to Warmia where he was ordained subdeacon on 4 January 1597. Andrew and Stephen even announced that they would not intervene in Transylvania. Their envoys also started discussions with Sigismund Báthory about the compensation for their expropriated Transylvanian estates.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{exchanged}} {{letters with}} Aaron the Tyrant, Voivode of Moldavia, {{who had been}} captured by Sigismund Báthory because of his attempts to <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Poland and the Ottoman Empire. The pope's special envoy, Martio Malacrida, tried to convince Andrew to accept the post of the ambassador of Poland in Rome, but Andrew again refused. He said, his homeland would require his presence, because Sigismund's anti-Ottoman policy could not be continued for long. Letters found on one of Stephen Báthory's retainers suggested that Andrew and his brother sent letters to {{the leaders of the}} Székely commoners who had risen up against Sigismund Báthory in February 1596. Sigismund III of Poland summoned Andrew and Stephen before the Senate, but Pope Clement VIII intervened on the brothers' behalf.|$|E

Spencer and Ashley flee the dance with Aiden and end up at a lookout over LA.|$|E

5|$|At the Hospitallers' request, Pope Gregory IX {{repeated}} the excommunication of Bohemond in March 1230. He authorized Gerald of Lausanne, Patriarch of Jerusalem, {{to lift the}} ban if Bohemond agreed to <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the Hospitallers. With the mediation of Gerald and the Ibelins, Bohemond and the Hospitallers made a treaty which was signed on 26 October 1231. Bohemond confirmed the Hospitallers' right to hold Jabala and a nearby fortress and granted them money fiefs in both Tripoli and Antioch. The knights renounced the privileges that Raymond-Roupen had granted to them. Before long, Gerald of Lausanne lifted the excommunication and sent the treaty to Rome to be confirmed by the Holy See.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius' {{accession}} as Emperor {{did little}} to reduce the Persian threat. Heraclius began his reign by attempting to <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the Persians, since Phocas, whose actions were the original casus belli, had been overthrown. The Persians rejected these overtures, however, since their armies were widely victorious. According to historian Walter Kaegi, {{it is conceivable that}} the Persians' goal was to restore or even surpass the boundaries of the Achaemenid Empire by destroying the Byzantine empire, though because of the loss of Persian archives, no document survives to conclusively prove this.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Victoria became {{seriously ill}} of typhoid fever {{on the last}} of the royal tours. Exploiting her {{weakened}} state, the Duchess and Conroy unsuccessfully tried to force her into signing a document; this document would have appointed Conroy her personal secretary upon her accession. Victoria emerged from the incident more determined than ever to become self-reliant. Her increased intransigence alarmed the Duchess. At her behest, family adviser Baron Stockmar investigated, recommending to the Duchess that she dismiss Conroy and <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> her daughter. But Conroy easily convinced the Duchess to ignore Stockmar's advice. Even after Victoria's eighteenth birthday on 24 May 1837, Conroy continued to pressure her to appoint him as her private secretary or acknowledge her need for a regent until she turned twenty-one.|$|E

5|$|In December 1796, {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars, a French expeditionary force {{departed}} from Brest on {{an expedition to}} invade Ireland. This army of 18,000 French soldiers was intended to link up with the secret organisation of Irish nationalists known as the United Irishmen and provoke a widespread uprising throughout the island. It was hoped that the resulting war would force Britain to <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the French Republic or risk losing control of Ireland altogether. Led by Vice-Admiral Morard de Galles, General Lazare Hoche {{and leader of the}} United Irishmen Wolfe Tone, the invasion fleet included 17 ships of the line, 27 smaller warships and transports, and carried extensive field artillery, cavalry and military stores to equip the Irish irregular forces they hoped to raise.|$|E
5|$|Lampugnano, {{unfortunately}} for the Guelphs, was considered a martyr for the Republic. This was made worse {{by the fact that}} the Guelphs in leadership refused to run elections in April, until in June they were forced by the populace. Ghibelline families took the reins of Milan in this election, and the Guelphs were defeated. However, the reprisals against the Guelphs, including the imprisonment of Appiani and Ossona who had been blamed (probably unjustly) for the massacre, led the populace to violently depose the Ghibellines and reinstall the extremist Guelphs. Gonzaga, however, whose friend Galeotto Toscano was killed in the uprising, departed Milan for Crema, hoping to <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Sforza.|$|E
5|$|Penelo {{is usually}} {{trying to keep}} Vaan out of trouble, {{but she could not}} stop Vaan from intruding into the palace grounds. She {{encountered}} Vaan, who was arrested along with Balthier and Fran. This encounter forced her into a series of events, when she was kidnapped by Bangaa headhunter Ba'gamnan and held as hostage in exchange for Balthier. When she managed to escape, she met with Larsa Solidor, one of the sons of Archadian Emperor Gramis, who took care of her and convinced her he wished to <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Dalmasca. When she is finally reunited with Vaan, she made him promise not to leave her side, and ever since traveled with Vaan, furthering their relationship as sky pirate and partner.|$|E

5|$|Philip II was {{twenty-four years}} old when he acceded to the throne in 359BC. Through the use of deft diplomacy, he was able to {{convince}} the Thracians under Berisades to cease their support of Pausanias, a pretender to the throne, and the Athenians to halt their support of another pretender. He achieved these by bribing the Thracians and their Paeonian allies and establishing a treaty with Athens that relinquished his claims to Amphipolis. He was also able to <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the Illyrians who had threatened his borders.|$|E
5|$|The Holy See {{also tried}} to reach a {{compromise}} on the Kraków bishopric, but Jan Zamoyski, who was {{in conflict with the}} king, persuaded Andrew to give up his claim in favor of Radziwiłł. Andrew withheld 20,000 gulden from the royal tax of Warmia, saying that the king owed him 40,000 gulden. He started negotiations with John George, Elector of Brandenburg, who promised him the hand of one of his daughters if he accepted the protection of Brandenburg over Warmia. Zamoyski, who had been with Sigismund III, also persuaded Andrew to <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the king in May 1593. Andrew renounced the see of Kraków in exchange for the Abbey of Czerwińsk nad Wisłą.|$|E
5|$|The Lisowczycy entered {{northern}} Hungary (now Slovakia) and in 1619 {{defeated the}} Transylvanian forces at the Battle of Humenné. Prince Bethlen Gábor of Transylvania, who {{together with the}} Czechs had laid siege to Vienna, had to hurry back to his country and <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Ferdinand, which seriously compromised {{the situation of the}} Czech insurgents, crushed in the course and {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of White Mountain. Afterwards the Lisowczycy ruthlessly fought to suppress the Emperor's opponents in Glatz (Kłodzko) region and elsewhere in Silesia, in Bohemia and Germany.|$|E

5|$|The first {{uprising}} {{was supported}} by Duke Swietopelk II, Duke of Pomerania. The Prussians were successful at first, reducing the Knights to only five of their strongest castles. Conversely, the duke suffered a series of military defeats and was eventually forced to <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the Teutonic Knights. With Duke Swietopelk's support for the Prussians broken, a prelate of Pope Innocent IV then negotiated a peace treaty between the Prussians and the Knights. However, this treaty was never honored or enforced, especially after the Battle of Krücken {{at the end of}} 1249.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the series, Sasuke {{is shown}} as silent {{character}} who seeks to become stronger {{by any means}} in order to kill his older brother, Itachi Uchiha, for betraying and murdering their entire clan.
