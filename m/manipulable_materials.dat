Neste sentido, para ajudar a delinear a estrutura deste estudo, formularam-se três questões orientadoras: 1) Como utilizam os alunos do 9. º ano os materiais manipuláveis na aprendizagem de Geometria?; 2) Que dificuldades revelam os alunos na utilização dos materiais manipuláveis na aprendizagem de Geometria? e 3) Qual a relação entre as perceções dos alunos sobre a influência dos materiais manipuláveis e a sua aprendizagem em Geometria? Enquanto professora, a preocupação centra-se em proporcionar atividades em que os alunos sejam parte ativa no processo de ensino e aprendizagem da matemática, o que requer uma renovação no modo de organizar e ensinar na aula de matemática. Os materiais manipuláveis aliados a tarefas desafiantes e motivadoras promovem o envolvimento ativo dos alunos nas atividades em sala de aula e permitem a concretização de conceitos. Tendo em vista os objetivos do estudo, analisou-se o trabalho de uma turma do nono ano de escolaridade, constituída por dezoito alunos, pertencentes ao concelho de Barcelos, em torno de seis tarefas que pressupunham a utilização de diferentes materiais manipuláveis. O estudo aponta que o sucesso do uso dos materiais manipuláveis em sala de aula, efetivamente, depende do modo como é introduzido em sala de aula, do à vontade do professor com o material, do tipo de {{material e}} do tipo de atividade realizada por parte dos alunos que lhe está inerente e da predisposição dos alunos para trabalharem com os materiais. Assim sendo, quando estas condições são favoráveis, os materiais manipuláveis são bons facilitadores para representar e descrever ideias matemáticas. Assim, a sua manipulação e exploração propiciam um ambiente de experiência Matemática, onde os alunos podem testar e provar as suas conjeturas, bem como comunicar as suas ideias, levando-os a apropriarem-se de um conjunto de características geométricas do objeto que lhes dá maior flexibilidade de raciocínio. The {{main purpose of}} this report was to understand how students interpret the concepts of ninth grade geometry when they use <b>manipulable</b> <b>materials</b> and how they use them in the consolidation of these concepts. In this sense, to help delineate the structure of this study, three guiding questions were formulated: 1) How are <b>manipulable</b> <b>materials</b> by students in the ninth grade to learn Geometry?; 2) What difficulties do students reveal {{in the use of}} <b>manipulable</b> <b>materials</b> in learning Geometry? and 3) What is the relationship between students' perceptions about the influence of <b>manipulable</b> <b>materials</b> and their learning in Geometry? As teachers, the concern is on providing activities in which students are active in the process of teaching and learning of mathematics, which requires a renewal in organization and teaching in the math class. <b>Manipulable</b> <b>materials</b> combined with motivating and challenging tasks promote the active involvement of students in classroom activities and enable the consolidation of concepts. In light of the objectives of the study, I analysed the work of a ninth grade class, consisting of eighteen students belonging to the municipality of Barcelos, around six tasks that presupposed using different <b>manipulable</b> <b>materials.</b> The study points out that the success of the use of <b>manipulable</b> <b>materials</b> in the classroom effectively depends on how it is introduced in the classroom, on the teacher's ease with the material, the type of material and the type of activity performed by the students and the students' predisposition to work with materials. However, when these conditions are favourable, the <b>manipulable</b> <b>materials</b> are good facilitators to represent and describe mathematical ideas. Thus, its handling and operation enable an environment of Mathematical experience, where students can test and prove their conjectures, as well as communicate their ideas, leading them to take in a set of geometrical characteristics of the object which gives them greater flexibility of reasoning...|$|E
40|$|Pigs have a {{need for}} <b>manipulable</b> <b>materials</b> to satisfy a range of {{behavioural}} needs, which can be different in different classes of pig. When these needs are not met, a range of adverse welfare consequences result, one of these being an increased risk for tail-biting in weaners and rearing pigs. The ability to control the risk of tail- biting is essential when aiming to avoid tail-docking. Based on available scientific information this Opinion identifies the multiple interactions between risk factors, welfare consequences and animal and non-animal-based measures on the two subjects requested (i) the absence of functional <b>manipulable</b> <b>materials,</b> for pigs at different stages in life and (ii) tail-biting, for weaners and rearing pigs only. An attempt is made to quantify {{the relationships between the}} identified interactions by carrying out a statistical analysis of information from available databases, those being an international dataset collected using the Welfare Quality® protocol, which was not designed to evaluate risk factors for tail-biting and therefore, it had limitations in fitness for this analysis, and a large Finnish dataset with undocked pigs. Based on the current state of knowledge, the AHAW Panel proposes two simple tool-boxes for on farm use to assess (i) the functionality of the supplied manipulable material and (ii) the presence and strength of risk factors for tail biting. Both proposed tool-boxes include a combination of the most important resource-based and animal-based measures. Further development and validation of decision–support tools for customised farm assessment is strongly recommended and a proposal for harmonised data collection across the range of European farming circumstances is presented. A series of further recommendations are made by the AHAW Panel...|$|E

40|$|Tail biting {{behaviour}} {{is a major}} {{animal welfare}} issue in intense pig production, {{as well as an}} economic issue. To prevent the behaviour, tail docking is practised. It is a painful procedure where a part of or the whole tail is cut off. There is a lot of research on the subject of tail biting, with a big variety of solutions to prevent the behaviour. Scientists are consistent about that the absence of <b>manipulable</b> <b>material</b> increases the risk for tail biting. <b>Manipulable</b> <b>material</b> works as an environmental enrichment and stimulates natural behaviours of the pig, such as investigation and rooting. It helps pigs to cope with the environment and reduces stress and frustration, triggers that can lead to tail biting. The legal requirement regarding tail docking state that it shall not be practised on a routine and has been in force since the 1 st of January 1994. It was strengthened in 2003 and now appears in Council Directive 2008 / 120 /EC which codifies the earlier directives. The legal requirement now states that measures to prevent tail biting shall be taken before practising tail docking, measures such as changing inadequate management systems, changed environment and reduced stock densities. Pigs shall also have access to a suitable material or object, to be able to perform natural behaviours and prevent tail biting and stereotypies. In the latest version of the directive on pigs this material was defined as straw, hay, wood, sawdust, mushroom compost, peat or a mixture of such. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the current situation of compliance with the legal requirements in the directive on pigs, regarding the provision of <b>manipulable</b> <b>material</b> and the routine practice of tail docking. It was also to investigate actions to increase compliance among the Member States in the European Union. A descriptive analysis of available FVO-reports was used, together with written answers from the Competent Authorities and a qualitative interview with people at the Commission and the FVO. The results of this report showed that 18 out of 28 Member States in the European Union do not comply with the legal requirement regarding the provision of <b>manipulable</b> <b>material,</b> and that 17 of the Member States do not comply with the legal requirement regarding the practice of tail docking. There has not been any actions such as sanctions to increase the compliance among the Member States. These findings make an overall conclusion about the current issues with the compliance of the directive on pigs. There are no further intrinsic actions to increase compliance, due to a lack of responsibility among the involved parties, such as pig farmers, Competent Authorities and the Commision. Due to the lack of intrinsic action, it is an impossibility to conclude when full compliance will be fulfilled...|$|R

40|$|This paper problematizes the {{constitution}} of teachers to teach mathematics in the early grades by considering a government policy – the National Pact for Literacy at the Right Age (PNAIC). For theoretical discussions, we considered Foucauldian studies, particularly the concepts of discourse, games of truth and government (conduction of conducts). The material consists of PNAIC Handbooks for Mathematical Literacy, comprehending Handbook 1 - Organization of the Pedagogical Work. From this material, the following groups of analysis have emerged: ‘instructions for teachers to guide the students, the classroom activities and records’; ‘pedagogical guidelines from the students’ experiences’; and ‘consideration of games, play and use of <b>manipulable</b> <b>material</b> to teach mathematics’. By examining the guidelines/instructions proposed in the PNAIC handbook, we can point out that, like many other handbooks for ‘good education’, they reaffirm sayings and actions that mathematics teachers should follow in order to attain their goals...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the framework of the master's degree in Preschool Education and teaching of the first cycle of basic education, with students of a class of third-year elementary schooling in a Castelo Branco elementary school. Through this study, we intend to examine whether digital technology improving the number of success cases and decisionmaking in solving mathematical tasks involving repetition patterns, compared the tasks solved by using the standard blocks. This research, comparative in nature, was based on a mixed approach (quantitative and qualitative) data processing level. Our intervention was structured in 3 phases. In the first phase, the 23 students who made up the class solved 4 tasks with repeating patterns through a work record (repeating Patterns: ABAB, ABCABC, ABBABB e ABBCCABBCC). The responses of students, in the schedule of work, were analyzed through a holistic scale focused adaptation of [1], in which it was ranked each response between 0 to 2 points. From the ratings obtained by students, the class was divided into 2 homogenous groups. On the other hand, in the second phase, the students who were part of the Group (11 students) solved the same tasks using an applet, while students who comprised the Group B (12 students) solved the same tasks through manipulable material (standard blocks). To proceed to correction of the tasks of the group, we ran the ' screenshots ' to computer screens for each task. On the other hand, the answers of the students of Group B were analyzed using not only to work but also the photos of the compositions performed. In the third stage we proposed the same tasks, in which all students in the class, decided the issues through a worksheet. After the data analysis we found that there were no statistically significant differences between the results obtained by the students who worked with the applet compared students who worked with <b>manipulable</b> <b>materials.</b> Although both groups of the 1 st to the 3 rd stage have improved substantially in terms of decision-making, as well as the number of replies considered assertive, but not so complete that work with the applet was better for the work with <b>manipulable</b> <b>materials.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|When {{teaching}} {{students with visual impairments}} educators generally rely on tactile tools to depict visual mathematical topics. Tactile media, such as embossed paper and simple <b>manipulable</b> <b>materials,</b> are typically used to convey graphical information. Although these tools are easy to use and relatively inexpensive, they are solely tactile and are not modifiable. Dynamic and interactive technologies such as pin matrices and haptic pens are also commercially available, but tend to be more expensive and less intuitive. This study aims {{to bridge the gap between}} easy-to-use tactile tools and dynamic, interactive technologies in order to facilitate the haptic learning of mathematical concepts. We developed an haptic assistive device using a Tanvas electrostatic touchscreen that provides the user with multimodal (haptic, auditory, and visual) output. Three methodological steps comprise this research: 1) a systematic literature review of the state of the art in the design and testing of tactile and haptic assistive devices, 2) a user-centered system design, and 3) testing of the system’s effectiveness via a usability study. The electrostatic touchscreen exhibits promise as an assistive device for displaying visual mathematical elements via the haptic modality...|$|E

Previous research has indicated that young children are not engaging in enough physical play to maintain healthy lifestyles. Play may also have benefits for social competency and cognitive development. Observations of children 2 ̆ 7 s engagement with a new and engaging play material, Imagination Playground TM blocks, which are designed to foster imaginative and creative constructive play, were used to understand more about preschoolers 2 ̆ 7 physical activity, social behaviors, and 2 ̆ 2 engineering thinking play, 2 ̆ 2 a recently developed construct that focuses on early design- and construction-related thinking and behavior. The 2 ̆ 2 engineering thinking play 2 ̆ 2 observation measure was used as an index of the types of behaviors in which preschoolers are engaging that parallel thought-processes and behaviors associated with the engineering process (e. g., explanations of how things are built, construction, and generation of innovative and creative ideas). Results indicated no gender difference in the frequency of occurrence of early engineering thinking play, suggesting that research is needed exploring processes underlying boys 2 ̆ 7 and girls 2 ̆ 7 early cognition, and girls 2 ̆ 7 subsequent disinterest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics-related (STEM) careers, compared to boys. Additionally, children 2 ̆ 7 s play with large, manipulable, loose parts was associated with three times the frequency of engineering thinking play than occurred in the traditional outdoor playground. Large loose parts play also included high levels of gross motor and fine motor physical activity, and positive social play behaviors.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{theoretical}} discourses of political philosophy and economic theory {{are discussed in}} terms of schematic representations. These representations capture important features of the idealised cognitive models structuring political and economic discourse. Political theory provides the context with which to show how the use of visual and concrete representations (images) of conceptual metaphors {{can be used as a}} tool for exposing, analysing and testing the ontological commitments structuring theories in the sciences and social sciences. Significantly, Kuhn's (1962) argument that scientific research is based on the exploitation and extension of 'concrete analogy[s]' – understood as 'picture[s] of concrete object[s]' is developed to show how concrete images or analogies can be used as a tool for conducting metaphoric analysis. This leads to my suggesting alternative ways of thinking about gestalt images, visual perception, representation, image and motor schemas. I then demonstrate the use of models and metaphors as <b>manipulable</b> <b>material</b> artefacts to explore the ontological commitments of social sciences such as political theory. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Tail biting is {{a common}} and serious welfare problem in pig production, causing large {{economical}} losses. Tail docking is performed routinely in most EU countries to reduce the tail biting risk. However, tail docking is painful, and does not prevent tail biting totally. The risk factors behind tail docking are multifactorial and most analyses are based on studies using biological or epidemiological approaches. There is very little information available on how producers deal with tail biting on-farm. There are also no studies on the attitude of producers towards tail docking and tail biting in systems with long-tailed pigs. We aimed to study how farmers rate the efficiency of different measures for preventing and intervening with tail biting, when tail docking is not allowed. Furthermore, we investigated the attitudes of Finnish farmers to tail docking and tail biting. Results Respondents scored feeding-related issues to be most important for prevention of tail biting, identifying and removing the biting pig as most important intervention measures, and straw {{as the most important}} <b>manipulable</b> <b>material</b> when preventing tail biting. Tail biting was not perceived as a very serious problem by over 70  % of the respondents, even though docking is not allowed, and was reported to occur close to a level which was also considered acceptable by the respondents. Most respondents did not think it is probable they would raise tail docked pigs if it were possible, but about 21  % probably would. Conclusions In comparison with other authors’ findings, the ranking of importance of risk factors for tail biting differs between scientists and farmers, and between farmers in different cultures of pig production. In addition, the attitude towards tail biting and tail docking appears to be very different in producers with different experiences of tail docking. These results indicate that a scientist-farmer dialogue, as well as international communication is important when trying {{to reduce the risk of}} tail biting, and subsequently the need for tail docking...|$|R
40|$|Data from {{a growing}} number of {{research}} studies indicate that children with hearing loss are delayed in Theory of Mind (ToM) development when compared to their typically developing, hearing peers. While other researchers have studied the developmental trajectories of ToM in school-age students who are deaf and hard of hearing (DHH), a limited number have addressed the need for interventions for this population. The present study extends the current research on ToM interventions to the PreKindergarten and Kindergarten levels. This study used a single-case multiple-baseline multiple-probe across skills design with replications across classrooms {{to examine the effects of}} a ToM intervention on participants’ false belief understanding as well as outcomes on a near generalization measure (i. e., Sally-Anne Task, Baron-Cohen, Firth, Leslie, 1985) and a far generalization measure (i. e., five-task ToM developmental scale, Wellman 2 ̆ 6 Liu, 2004). A thought bubble intervention (i. e., a visual representation of what people are thinking) developed by Wellman and Peterson (2013) was modified in key areas: (a) participants were substantially younger than the population in the original study and thus required a pre-teaching phase addressing vocabulary and materials, (b) <b>manipulable</b> <b>materials</b> were created from the description provided in the Wellman and Peterson (2013) study along with parallel materials used in assessment probes, (c) a certified teacher of DHH children provided direct instruction to participants in a small group setting, (d) study length was increased to 25 weeks, and (e) methodological design change (i. e., group design to single-case design). These modifications addressed the need for evidence-based ToM interventions that are both proactive and easily implemented by teachers in a classroom setting. Results from the single-case design portion of the study indicate a functional relation between the thought bubble intervention and the participants’ acquisition of the targeted skills in each stage, although progress was not uniform. Results from the pre-post assessments indicate that the children did make progress up the scale, however, children who used spoken language tended to proceed faster through the stages than those who used sign language. These results inform the field in regard to the efficacy and feasibility of a ToM intervention for young DHH children...|$|E
40|$|This study {{addressed}} the issue of whether preschool subtests of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, L-M, (Level II through Level V) which had been adapted or modified for use with young children with handicaps were equivalent to the standard subtests. The {{question of whether or not}} the cognitive components of the adapted and the standard subtests had been held constant was examined by a systematic norming of the adapted version of the test on a non-handicapped preschool population. It was hypothesized that no significant differences would be found between the subjects 2 ̆ 7 performances on the adapted subtests and on the standard subtests. ^ Stimulus adaptions were designed for 41 of the 49 subtests of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, Form L-M, (Level II through Level V). These adaptions consisted of the use of larger and more <b>manipulable</b> <b>materials,</b> enlarged pictures, separation of stimulus materials from book format and changes in the medium of stimulus materials. The primary intent of each adaption was the reduction of the sensory and motor components of each task. The study involved the administration of the standard and the adapted form to each of 70 non-handicapped preschool subjects ranging in age from 2 years to 5 years- 11 months with a mean age of 3 years- 9 months. Each of the subjects received both forms with a one week interval between administrations. The order of administration of the standard form was counterbalanced with the adapted form. ^ Student t-tests were performed for each pair of items (score on standard subtest and score on adapted subtest) in order to determine which pairs of items had statistically significant differences. The hypothesis that no significant difference would be found was confirmed for all but 5 of the 41 adapted subtests. ^ In response to criticisms regarding adaptive assessment, this study offered a systematic approach to both adapting test items and recording performances, examined the performances of a non-handicapped preschool population using a repeated measures design, and confirmed the practice of modifying standardized subtests for use with handicapped children without sacrificing the cognitive or functional equivalence of the tasks. These results contribute a number of implications both to the assessment of children with handicaps and to the direction of future research in this area. ...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{primarily}} compiles work {{in which}} the author (Marc Bracke) {{has been involved with}} providing science-based decision support on the question of what is proper enrichment material for intensively-farmed pigs as required by EC Directive 2001 / 93 /EC. Proper <b>manipulable</b> <b>material</b> should primarily provide occupation (i. e. reduce boredom), and preferably reduce tail biting. The RICHPIG model was built expressing enrichment value as a score on a scale from 0 to 10. Metal objects like short metal chains had the lowest score. Subsequently, the Dutch government banned the use of metal chains and most Dutch pig farmers attached a hard plastic ball or pipe to the prevalent, short metal chain. Unfortunately, our on-farm observations repeatedly suggested that this ‘enrichment’ may have reduced pig welfare, rather than improving it as intended by the Directive. So-called AMI (animal-material interaction) sensors can be used to (semi-) automatically record object manipulation by attaching a motion sensor to hanging objects. AMI-sensors may provide objective, flexible and feasible registration tools of enrichment value, but their application is still rather demanding. Exploratory data are presented to demonstrate the utility of AMI-sensors. The enrichment value of short metal chains can be improved upon, e. g. by providing branched chains. This entails making chains longer, preferably reaching until the floor, and making them more readily available in a pig pen. To facilitate the process towards proper enrichment the principle of intelligent natural design (IND) is proposed. IND entails organising a repeated selection process of the (currently) best-available enrichment material so as to gradually reduce pig boredom and enhance the opportunities for the rearing of pigs with intact tails. IND should start with basically all pig farmers implementing promising enrichment like the branched-chain design on their farms as soon as possible, followed by conducting small-scale on-farm experiments to compare and improve enrichment through sharing of available knowledge. Suggestions are given as to how and why this novel approach can be implemented to solve persistent animal-welfare problems like providing proper enrichment for intensively-farmed pigs...|$|R
40|$|According to EU-regulations, sows {{should be}} {{provided}} with suitable <b>manipulable</b> <b>material,</b> this {{in order to meet}} their behavioural needs. "Strategic use of straw at farrowing" means that loose housed sows are provided with 15 - 20 kg of chopped straw once at 2 days prior to the calculated date of farrowing. This gives them increased access to nesting material and creates a more suitable environment with an improved micro-climate and increased comfort during farrowing and early lactation, compared to a limited use of straw. After farrowing, the straw is left to gradually drain through the slatted floor and is then replaced by a daily supply of 0. 5 – 1 kg straw in accordance with common Swedish management routines. The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate if strategic use of straw at farrowing is technically feasible and to investigate its effect on behaviour, health and production in farrowing sows and suckling piglets by studying the sow's nest-building behaviour and farrowing duration, the prevalence of bruising, piglet weight gain and pre-weaning mortality. Two studies were conducted in six conventional piglet-producing farms in South-West Sweden. Study I shows that it is technically possible to achieve an efficient throughput of straw and to maintain good pen hygiene in partly slatted farrowing pens for loose housed sows. However, straw chop lengths need to be adjusted to the type and design of the slatted pen floor. Study II shows that strategic use of straw made sows spend more time nest-building pre-partum and less time during the first hour after birth of the first piglet, compared to limited straw access. The sows also gave birth to fewer stillborn piglets. In piglets, strategic use of straw reduced the development of skin abrasions and soft heel/sole erosions. It also increased the average daily weight gain and mean body weight at weaning. Under the conditions studied, the overall pre-weaning mortality was not affected; however, the distribution of post-mortem findings differed, with fewer piglets dying due to starvation and more due to crushing. In summary, this thesis provides knowledge about housing around farrowing and its interaction with biological and behavioural mechanisms of importance for sow welfare and piglet survival and health. ...|$|R

Throughout history, mankind has conceivedgreat inventions, among them the playful soroban the Japanese abacus. In the Land of the Rising Sun, schools had as its motto: reading, writing and arithmetic, and the latter was synonymous with soroban. After the invention of the electronic calculator, there was a competition between soroban and calculator, and the first won, proving that the Japanese abacus is a effective and fast, or more, as the new technology available. Through the soroban all the fundamental basic operations of arithmetic can be performed. This work aims to show the potential of this tool, not only as a concrete and <b>manipulable</b> <b>material,</b> but as support to the understanding of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations, as well as their properties. Further, there is a short account of the experience and analysis of the use of soroban as support to 7 th grade students who failed in 2013. In teaching-learning process, using the principle that the teacher must seek new knowledge to his/her professional growth, students which are the focus, can also grow as the teacher believe, dare and try new materials and methodologiesA compreensão do sistema posicional decimal é fundamental para a construção do conhecimento lógico-matemático. No decorrer da história, o homem concebeu grandes inventos, entre eles, o mais lúdico, soroban – ábaco japonês. No país do Sol nascente, a escola tinha como lema: ler, escrever e fazer contas, e este último era sinônimo de soroban. Após a invenção da calculadora eletrônica, houve um campeonato entre soroban e calculadora, e o primeiro venceu, comprovando que o ábaco japonês é tão ou mais eficaz e rápido quanto a nova tecnologia do momento.

40|$|The {{reality of}} current pig {{production}} {{practices in the}} European Union is {{that a majority of}} Member States are in violation of current legislation. This violation of minimum level legislation has been ongoing for several years. The latest version of the directive of pigs is Council Directive 2008 / 120 /EC of 18 December 2008 laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs, which clearly states that provision of <b>manipulable</b> <b>material</b> is a requirement. In addition tail docking is not to be performed on a routine basis. Before tail docking farmers must first try to prevent tail biting by changing inadequate environmental conditions. In recent years this issue has drawn attention from various directions; universities, animal welfare societies, European Parliament’s Intergroup on Animal Welfare and Member State Ministers, yet the issue remains unresolved. The aim {{of this study was to}} collect and analyse the opinions of Members of Parliament regarding the subject of lack of compliance with the Directive on Pigs, as well as to investigate how involved Members of Parliament are in the issue. This was done through an email questionnaire. The results should be interpreted with caution. The knowledge of Members of Parliament on pig welfare legislation is varied and the actual knowledge of the current situation is very diverse. The issue of lack of compliance to current legislation has different views of prioritization among Members of Parliament. However full compliance is of importance. Members of Parliament express that the European Commission has not actively lived up to their role in the issue of non-compliance among Member States. It can be concluded that there is a wide variation in the perceptions of Members of Parliament regarding lack of compliance with the Council Directive 2008 / 120 /EC of 18 December 2008 laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs. Furthermore through strict office policies of some Members of Parliament to not answer surveys, it is impossible to examine what issues these politicians are prioritizing to work with. This study presents a first glimpse at the attention paid to pig welfare amongst Members of Parliament and the attitudes towards non-compliance with current legislation. Members of Parliament expect the European Commission to do more on the issue of non-compliance to pig legislation. It is of the utmost importance that the Commission takes urgent action to improve the compliance rate among Member States to the Directive on Pigs...|$|R
