According to {{the modern}} {{technology}} of sugar production normative expansion reducing substances in the cleaning diffusion juice, should {{be held in the}} <b>main</b> <b>liming</b> controlled temperature with an excess of lime alkalinity, followed by removal of the decay products have appeared due to the adsorption of calcium carbonate in the processing of juice carbon dioxide. Test data show the growth rate of thermochemical quantities of sucrose decay with increasing temperature, with the greatest degree in the experiments with a small share of reducing substances in solutions. With increase in the proportion of reducing substances to 0, 3 %, the rate is reduced to about twice, with a 80 ° C and found to decrease its rate of growth. <b>Main</b> <b>liming</b> process preceded progressive preliming, not only where the epimerization faster but less stable, and the decomposition of fructose in the composition of the reducing substances to produce reactive products influencing the alkalinity of the solution and the surface state of microparticles of calcium hydroxide. The presence on the surface OH-groups and the appearance of tumors in the working environment, having in their structures group (= CO), (= O), (- СОН) contributes to the appearance of induced hydrogen bonds and partial reduction of the specific surface of the mass transfer between the solid particles and the components of the solution. Carboxyl group reduce the level of active alkalinity, which as a result of blocking is limited, which reduces the pH of the environment and the decay constant reducing substances. When heated to about 85 °C decomposed 20 % of the reducing substances, and chromaticity increased by 83, 1 %, taking into account the heating and hot <b>main</b> <b>liming</b> chromaticity increased by 116, 9 %.

To examine this, we performed laboratory toxicity studies {{of the effects of}} wood-ash added to an agricultural soil and the organic horizon of a coniferous plantation soil with the detrivore soil collembolans Folsomia candida and Onychiurus yodai, the gamasid predaceous mite Hypoaspis aculeifer, and the enchytraeid worm Enchytraeus crypticus. We used ash concentrations spanning 0 - 75 g kg- 1 soil. As ash increases pH we compared bioash effects with effects of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH) 2, the <b>main</b> <b>liming</b> component of ash. Only high ash concentrations above 15 g kg- 1 agricultural soil or 17 t ha- 1 had significant effects on the collembolans. The wood ash neither affected H. aculeifer nor E. crypticus. The estimated osmolalities of Ca(OH) 2 and the wood ash were similar at the LC 50 concentration level. We conclude that short-term chronic effects of wood ash differ among different soil types, and osmotic stress is the likely cause of effects while high pH and heavy metals is of minor importance...|$|E

To improve the efficiency of the purification steps juice we have proposed a two-stage carbonation I cleaned juice. Holding two stages I saturation at high pH juice is justified in view of the efficiency of adsorption treatment with calcium carbonate. To quantify the proposed option saturation performed laboratory research on plant juices derived from beet varying quality, with the definition of quality indicators to be cleansed juice at all stages of processing the raw juice in warm preliming, the combined <b>main</b> <b>liming,</b> I and II carbonation. Indicators were evaluated for juice in the sugar industry accepted methods. In comparison with the standard version of the proposed two-stage version of I carbonation with intermediate filtration improves filtration performance carbonated juice on 24 – 26 %, reduce the color of the purified juice to 17 – 23 %, the content of calcium in the 22 – 24 %, improve the overall treatment effect 16 – 19 % (relative).  Improving the quality of the purified juice ensures the production of white sugar of standard quality, an increase in the cleaning effect of diffusion juice reduces the loss of sucrose in the molasses and increases the yield of the final commercial product. The proposed version of the separation processes of thermochemical conversion of non-sugars will create conditions for maximum removal by adsorption of their decay products, particularly dyes. </p...|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{effect of}} {{reducing}} substances {{in the final}} stage of lime - carbon dioxide purification of raw juice is studied in the article. The presence of significant amounts of reducing substances in the juice of the I saturation increases chroma and calcium salts in the purified product. It is actual to apply additional techniques and methods of cleaning of production sugar-containing solutions at {{the final stage of}} lime -carbon dioxide cleaning - II saturation, that will increase the completeness of precipitation of organic and mineral non-sugars, improve the quality of the purified juice, increase the yield of white sugar and improve its quality. The effect filtroperlit as seed material for forming the structure of particles of calcium carbonate precipitate with a larger surface adsorption is studied. The effect of phosphate input for further improvement of the efficiency of adsorption in the juice purification process was also studied. The effect of flow of activated filtroperlit on II saturation filtration speed was studied. It was found out that the more non-sugars are present in the juice, the smaller electrokinetic potential has the surface sediment. Rational consumption of reagents depending {{on the quality of the}} feedstock is calculated. In the process of cleaning the juice of various technological quality, it is necessary to control the reagents flow. It was found out that for cleaning juice of satisfactory technological quality the flow of filtroperlit is 0. 015 - 0. 033 % by weight of juice and 15 % РО 4 3 -. When cleaning the juice obtained from sugar beet of poor quality, it is necessary to increase the filtroperlit flow up to 0. 050 % and phosphate up to 20 %.

40|$|Inelastic {{behavior}} {{has an important}} influence {{on the design of}} structures, and reducing the computational time involved in the associated computational modeling of these structures is an important goal. The Large Increment Method (LIM) is a specific kind of force-based method, which involves separating the structural analysis equations, leading to improved convergence. Generally, studying inelastic behavior with displacement-based methods is a time consuming process usually requiring a large number of elements to model a given problem. LIM is efficient at reducing both the computation time and the number of elements involved. Most structural analysis software is designed based upon displacement methods. However, due to its dependency on the discretisation of the total load into smaller steps, error is inevitably introduced, progressively accumulating at every step. The process of eliminating this error is time consuming and is never completely removed, even though a large number of techniques have been proposed in order to improve its effectiveness [1, 2] The <b>main</b> advantage of <b>LIM</b> over the displacement method is that it separates the globa...|$|R

He was born in 1938, and lived most of his life in the Cemetery. His father found {{difficulty}} to find work when he first arrived in Singapore from China but was soon recommended to a job as a tomb keeper at the Japanese Cemetery. Lim grew up in the cemetery assisting his father in the cremating bodies and arranging burials at the cemetery. When the young Lim came of age, he tried to seek other forms of employment but in 1960, his father fell sick, and requested him to take over his duties as tomb keeper. And so the young man in his 20s took over his father's duties to become the second generation tomb keeper. Like his father, Lim was paid a minimal salary for the job, but given free accommodation and transportation. As he was thrifty in nature, he was able to start his own family, and expanded his living quarters when his family size grew. In 1973, new burials was not allowed, so <b>Lim's</b> <b>main</b> duties was to look after and maintain the Japanese cemetery, as well as serving as a cemetery guide for visitors from Japan.|$|R

40|$|Although the {{internet}} has had many benefits for organizations, employees may misuse their workplace internet access by surfing non-job related Web sites for personal purposes and by both checking and sending personal e-mail. These activities may constitute an unproductive use of time in that they distract employees from carrying out and completing their <b>main</b> job duties (<b>Lim,</b> 2000). Within the domain of organizational communication, however, no research exists into the antecedents of so-called cyberloafing. In fact, research on organizational behavior in general has predominantly focused on the positive side. That is, researchers have continued to direct most of their attention on how various behaviors benefit organizations and the antecedent conditions of these behaviors. For example, many studies have investigated how processes within an organization affect such variables as job satisfaction, job performance and so-called “Organizational Citizenship Behavior” or OCB (behavior considered {{above and beyond the}} call of duty). By contrast, the research discussed in this presentation will focus on the dark side of organizational behavior. This dark side consists of behaviors that are believed to be injurious to an organization, although the costs cannot always be readily measured (cf. Griffin & O’Leary-Kelly, in press). Dark side behaviors may vary from inappropriate absenteeism and antisocial behavior towards co-workers, to theft and destruction of organizational property. In the literature these behaviors have been identified as “antisocial behaviors” (Giacalone & Greenberg, 1997), “anticitizenship behaviors” (Ball, Trevino, & Sims, 1994), “counterproductive work behaviors” (Fox, Spector, & Miles, 2001) or “deviant workplace behaviors” (Robinson & Bennet, 1995). Our presentation will especially focus on cyberloafing (Lim, 2000) as potential dark side behavior. Data from a survey among 224 employees of a local government show that, consistent with a conceptualization of dark side behaviors as a form of retaliation against unjust treatment (Skarlicki & Folger, 1997), perceptions of distributive, procedural and interactional justice are related to various negative behaviors, including cyberloafing. In addition, the data suggest that a lack of affective commitment to an organization may constitute an important antecedent condition of cyberloafing...|$|R
