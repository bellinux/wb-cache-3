40|$|Two {{asynchronous}} data communication mechanisms (ACMs) using self-timed circuits are presented. Mutual exclusion elements {{are used to}} concentrate potential metastability to discrete points {{so that it can}} be resolved entirely within the ACMs themselves. Self-timed circuits allow the <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> between the reader and writer processes and the ACMs. Initial analysis shows that these VLSI solutions are more robust with regard to steering logic metastability, and can potentially run faster than solutions under fundamental mode assumptions. They are therefore more suitable for use in on-chip multi-processing systems. 1. Introduction Data communication between processes running in different processors has been extensively studied, especially in distributed and real-time systems. The minimal form of this problem concerns the passing of data between two distributed single-thread processes. One provides the data, which is used by the other.

40|$|Thin film oxide-oxide {{interfaces}} with associated lattice misfits {{ranging from}} - 20 to + 27 %, have been 'grown' by depositing ions onto a surface {{in conjunction with}} dynamics simulation and energy <b>minimisation.</b> Inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting <b>interfaces</b> revealed significant structural features within the thin film. These included, for the CaO/MgO(100) system (+ 13 % misfit), <b>the</b> exposure <b>of</b> various CaO surfaces at the interface; grain-boundary formation; <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> periodic arrays of misfit induced dislocations; lattice slip, and rotations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thin film {{with respect to the}} support. In each case the driving force to such behaviour was attributed to the reduction in the strain energy generated within <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> which arises from the lattice misfit between the two materials. <b>The</b> implications <b>of</b> employing periodic boundary conditions within interface calculations are also addressed. For those interfaces with high associated lattice misfits: BaO/MgO (+ 27 %), SrO/MgO (+ 20 %) and MgO/SrO (- 20 %), the deposition procedure yielded thin films with amorphous type structures. In <b>the</b> second part <b>of</b> this study we have explored briefly how one may exercise a degree <b>of</b> control over <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lattice misfit and its implications for the structure and consequently the chemical and physical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thin film. For example, for the SrO/MgO system, by including a CaO buffer layer between the SrO thin film and the MgO support material, it was possible to generate a more coherent and crystalline thin film, contrasting to the amorphous type structures observed without <b>the</b> inclusion <b>of</b> a buffer layer. An alternative approach, in which dopant ions were introduced into the thin film, resulted in pseudomorphic growth. In particular, the dopant ions modified <b>the</b> lattice parameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thin film to be commensurate with that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support...|$|R

Two models of neural networks for <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> computer cost and for <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> parallel program execution have been designed.

Finally, some simulation results related to <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy function for constructed neural networks have been included. Especially, a trajectory of energy function obtained during finding Pareto-optimal task allocation has been presented.

The work presented here is done in response to call for papers for <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Water Sensors Networks (BWSN), at the Water Distribution Systems Analysis Symposium (2006). The above problem is formulated and solved as a constrained multiobjective optimisation problem. The four objectives are: (1) <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expected time <b>of</b> detection, (2) <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expected population affected prior to detection, (3) <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expected demand <b>of</b> contaminated water prior to detection and (4) maximisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detection likelihood. The constraint modelled is <b>the</b> pre-specified number <b>of</b> detection sensors used in the sampling design. Decision variables are the sensor network locations. The solution methodology proposed is based on the novel Noisy Cross-Entropy Sensor Locator (nCESL) algorithm. This algorithm is applied to the two competition networks under four base contamination scenarios (A, B, C and D) and two different numbers of sensors available (5 and 20).
