500|$|After trying various {{science fiction}} shows after Lost, the Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson felt the episode made [...] "him feel like [...] picked a winner". Like other critics, Hanson loved the twist ending, writing that [...] "Fringe {{is making it}} more and more {{difficult}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> my favorite episode". Television Without Pity called Walternate's sudden appearance one of 2010's [...] "Most Memorable TV Moments", explaining [...] "We knew we'd meet him eventually, but the way they surprised us with him {{at the end of a}} stand-alone episode was a fitting introduction for such an ominous and shadowy character, and we knew even then that it marked a new and improved era for the show." [...] At the time, TV Fanatic called [...] "Northwest Passage" [...] the best Fringe episode to date, giving the series' its first [...] "five out of five stars".|$|E

6000|$|Jimmy Skunk chuckled. [...] "One more question, Unc' Billy," [...] said he. [...] "Did {{you ever}} know <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> a quarrel {{and use that}} bag of scent without being attacked?" ...|$|E
60|$|At other times, {{they set}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>picking</b> oakum, like a convict, which hempen {{business}} disagreeably obtruded thoughts of halters and the gallows; or whittling belaying-pins, like a Down-Easter.|$|R
60|$|Must. Let <b>me</b> alone <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> a quarrel; I {{have an old}} grudge to him upon thy account.|$|R
60|$|LIZA. You want <b>me</b> {{back only}} <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up your {{slippers}} {{and put up}} with your tempers and fetch and carry for you.|$|R
60|$|Aldo. You have me right. Be you the lion, {{to devour}} the prey; I am your jackall, {{to provide it}} for you: There will be a bone for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray compose yourself," [...] pleaded the persuasive Wragge. [...] "At present I {{have every}} reason to believe that you have just perused the only copy in circulation. Allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I {{would rather}} let him {{think that for}} the present I had dropped the whole matter. It may throw him off his guard and enable <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up more clews against him." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lie <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> - <b>picked</b> {{up for a}} full 22-episode {{season on}} November 24, 2009 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{too late}} for that, Dorward," [...] he said. [...] "If the seal were broken, they'd very soon guess where I came in, and it wouldn't help the work I have in hand for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>picked</b> up with a bullet in my {{forehead}} on the railway track." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{done his}} stent, and was helpin' <b>me.</b> I'll have <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> a lot before I git my quarter," [...] said the girl, {{defending}} her friend, {{in spite of}} her bashfulness.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Travers grinned, and {{removing}} his boots passed {{them out to}} the other. [...] "We don’t want her to hear me till I’m upstairs," [...] he whispered. [...] "Put ’em outside, handy for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see by {{the letter}} that Dr. Reed wishes <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> out your cameras," [...] said Mr. Jally. [...] "I am going to the city Saturday and will get them and leave them at the doctor's house Saturday evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you must}} allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> one, Sam. My friend Jim Slagg is at present cast adrift with a {{considerable}} {{part of the}} Great Eastern's crew. He will be delighted to go, I know, and is a first-rate, hard-working, willing, conscientious youth." ...|$|E
5000|$|In February 1964, Manush {{was elected}} by the Veterans Committee to the Baseball Hall of Fame. [...] On {{learning}} the news, Manush, {{at his home in}} Sarasota, Florida, told reporters, [...] "It's quite a shock <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>picked</b> [...] [...] [...] I feel wonderful [...] [...] [...] I had no idea this would ever happen to me." ...|$|R
60|$|Brief as my impromptu return had been, it had afforded <b>me</b> time <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up a heart-ache; I {{remarked that}} Frances had already removed the red embers of her cheerful little {{fire from the}} grate: forced to {{calculate}} every item, to save in every detail, she had instantly on my departure retrenched a luxury too expensive to be enjoyed alone.|$|R
5000|$|John ONeill from Black Gate {{stated that}} [...] "Into the Unknown makes <b>me</b> want <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up my dice again. In terms of sheer {{inspirational}} value, it surpasses any title since Frostburn (2004) and Sandstorm (2005). Even {{if you never}} play D&D again, Into the Unknown is still a great value, especially for collectors and old school gamers who appreciate {{the fine art of}} dungeon design." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course one {{picks up}} {{a great deal from}} experience; and there is plenty of work on the stage. But it in my genius which enables <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up things, and to work on the stage instead of in a kitchen or laundry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something's sure {{to turn up}} {{to give us a}} hint; {{only this}} job can't be rushed. You may depend on <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the least little bit of a hint; but you, sir--you've got to play him very gently. For the rest you can trust me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Imagine my {{not letting}} him sink, as I was his fag!’ said Mr. Tartar. ‘But the truth being {{that he was}} my best {{protector}} and friend, and did me more good than all the masters put together, an irrational impulse seized <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> him up, or go down with him.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Adolphe, are you? I don't {{think much}} of Adolphe for a name;--but it ain't no {{difference}} <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Just <b>pick</b> up them bits; will you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Bradford Louryk {{stumbled}} across the LP in a used record store. [...] He recalled, [...] "there {{she was in}} that green dress on this great cover, which made <b>me</b> want <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it up. And written on the cover were all these leading questions, like 'is she a woman?' 'can she have children?' and things like that." [...] He created the show and finally got it produced a few years later.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Trefoil's {{frame of}} mind will not allow her to eat or to drink with such a dastard," [...] said she turning away in the {{direction}} of the park gates. [...] "Perhaps, Sir George, you will be kind enough to direct the man who brought <b>me</b> here <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>me</b> up at the lodge." [...] And so she walked away--a mile across the park,--neither of them caring to follow her.|$|R
60|$|And she popped off, leaving <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the pieces. When I had {{collected}} the debris {{to some extent}} I went {{to my room and}} rang for Jeeves. He came in looking {{as if nothing had happened}} or was ever going to happen. He was the calmest thing in captivity.|$|E
60|$|He stooped {{and helped}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up my linen, as courteously as if I {{had been a}} princess of the blood; and, {{because he was a}} gentleman, I suppose, and a stranger, the archers did not meddle with him, save to break certain soldiers' jests, making me glad that I was other than I appeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come, Oakes, this {{is getting}} to be puerile, for two old fellows, turned of fifty. You very well know that I was offered just as good a fleet, as this of your own, {{with a choice of}} the whole list of flag-officers below <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> a junior from; and, so, we'll say no more about it. As respects their red riband, however, it may go a-begging for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|I 'gree to thet; she's nigh us to wut France is; But then she'll hev to {{make the}} fust advances; We've gut pride, tu, an' gut it by good rights, [...] 210 An' ketch <b>me</b> stoopin' <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the mites O' condescension she'll be lettin' fall When she finds out we ain't dead arter all! I tell ye wut, it takes more'n one good week Afore my nose forgits it's hed a tweak.|$|R
6000|$|SENTINEL (bluntly). I would, {{sooner than}} let her pass. She {{wanted to take}} boat, and go--so she said--to the lighthouse. I stopped her, as I was ordered to; and she set this fellow on <b>me.</b> (He goes <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up his pilum and returns to his place with it.) ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was now in}} the mortifying predicament of one who {{suddenly}} finds himself a scholar {{when he came to}} teach, and nothing was left for <b>me</b> but <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up as much of his conversation as I could, {{for the benefit of the}} next company. I told, indeed, Allan Ramsay's story of the Monk and Miller's Wife, in order to retreat with some honour under cover of a parting volley. Here, however, my flank was again turned by the eternal stranger.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that, Sam; but I didn't leave Knoxbury {{immediately}} after getting the money. I had an errand {{to do for}} Minnie. She wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> out a--er--a necktie for my birthday, and I--well, I looked around two or three stores, trying to find something nice to take back to her. I bought two books of poetry, but I don't {{know where they are}} now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take up that corselet," [...] he {{commanded}} hoarsely. I did his bidding, and, without a word, {{he raised his}} arms that I might fit it to his breast. Yet in the instant that I turned <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the back-piece, a crash resounded through the chamber. He had hurled the breastplate {{to the ground in}} a fresh access of terror-rage. He strode towards me, his eyes glittering like a madman's.|$|E
6000|$|... "You crawled {{off your}} cot in {{delirium}} one night, and I found you groping among some papers scattered from your pocket-book about the floor," [...] he said. [...] "It required {{the assistance of}} two Krooboys to induce you to lie down again, and Miss Castro helped <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the papers. I, however, found this among them first, and considered it well {{to take charge of}} it in the meantime. Miss Castro, you have heard, made an excellent nurse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right, little girl. I'm {{glad you}} did. The best for us every time. And to-morrow night I {{want you to}} run up with <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Salinger's an' <b>pick</b> out a good bedroom set an' carpet for that room. And it must be good. Nothin' snide." ...|$|R
60|$|After he had harangued {{upon that}} subject a good while, and had assured {{me he had}} no design upon me, {{that he did not}} come to make a prize of <b>me,</b> or <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> my pocket, which, by the way, I was in no fear of, for I took too much care of my money to part with any of it that way, he then turned his {{discourse}} to the subject of love, a point so ridiculous <b>to</b> <b>me</b> without the main thing, I mean the money, that I had no patience to hear him make so long a story of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was passing}} along, not far distant, when I heard your cry," [...] Stanley said. [...] "Thinking {{that it was}} some person in distress, I ran hither, and saw you both lying, with the leopard's forepaws upon you. The beast's back was turned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and, as it was growling, it had not heard my approach. Seeing the guns lying there--and having no doubt that they were loaded--I stole up, sprang {{suddenly}} on the leopard, and drove my knife into it behind the shoulder. The blow rolled it over, and gave <b>me</b> time <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the gun. The rest was easy." ...|$|R
