If the mass of the mountain could be independently established from a determination of its volume and an estimate of the mean density of its rocks, then these values could be extrapolated to provide the mean density of the Earth, and by extension, its mass.|$|E

5|$|As Typhoon Tingting {{approached}} the Mariana Islands, three Chinese women drowned in rough seas {{produced by the}} storm in Saipan. On June28, Tingting produced strong winds throughout the region. Sustained winds on Guam reached 82km/h (51mph) with gusts to 106km/h (66mph); a pressure of 994.6hPa (mbar) was also recorded on the island. Although located closer {{to the center of}} Tingting, Rota reported lower winds than Guam; the highest sustained wind reached 70km/h (44mph) with gusts of 93km/h (58mph). Due to the lack of sufficient observations on Tinian, the highest sustained winds recorded were suspected to be lower than what they really were. Winds of 56km/h (35mph) were recorded several times with gusts to 84km/h (52mph). Sustained winds on Saipan were recorded up to 100km/h (62mph) with gusts to 124km/h (77mph); a pressure of 984.9hPa (mbar) was also recorded.

5|$|Based on ship {{observations}} {{in the southeastern}} Gulf of Mexico, a low-pressure area developed north of Key West in early August. It developed into a tropical depression at 12:00UTC on August8, and strengthened into a tropical storm at 06:00UTC on August9 while moving northwestward off {{the west coast of}} Florida. Gradual intensification continued, and at 06:00UTC on August11 the storm strengthened to hurricane status. At 22:00UTC on August11, the hurricane reached its peak intensity and concurrently made landfall near the border between Alabama and Florida as a small tropical cyclone. During this time, the storm's maximum sustained winds were estimated at 80mph (130km/h), making it the equivalent of a Category1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. A lull in the storm accompanied the nearby passage of its eye before conditions once again deteriorated. Although the lowest barometric pressure <b>measured</b> <b>on</b> land was 1007 mbar (hPa; 29.74 inHg) in Pensacola, Florida, the storm's pressure was estimated to be much lower at 982 mbar (hPa: 29.00 inHg). After making landfall, the hurricane weakened and slowly drifted westward, weakening to a tropical depression over Louisiana on August 13, before dissipating over Arkansas by 12:00 UTC the next day.|$|E

Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape.

AADT data for sections north of Varaždin show considerable drops in traffic volume. As the motorway traffic volume is measured through analysis of toll ticket sales, the southernmost section of the motorway, Ivanja RekaSveta Helena, {{is not included in}} the report. However, since the section {{is a part of the}} Zagreb bypass, it carries significantly heavier traffic than any other sections of the A4 motorwayin 2004, traffic volume along the toll-free section of the A4 motorway was approximately 24,000vehicles per day (AADT) between the Kraljevečki Novaki and Sveta Helena interchanges and nearly 41,000vehicles per day between the Kraljevečki Novaki and Ivanja Reka interchanges.

5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted {{by means of}} a traffic census at toll stations and reported by Hrvatske autoceste. The reported traffic volume gradually decreases as the motorway chainage increases and as it passes by various major destinations and the interchanges that serve them. Thus the greatest volume of traffic is registered along Zagreb bypass, especially the JankomirLučko section, with 41,549vehicle annual average daily traffic (AADT). The busiest tolled section of the motorway is Ivanja RekaRugvica with 27,049AADT and 34,543vehicle average summer daily traffic (ASDT) figures. The traffic volume gradually decreases from that section eastward to the eastern terminus of the motorway, where the lowest AADT and ASDT figures are recorded. The traffic volume decrease is somewhat more pronounced at interchanges serving Slavonski Brod and the A5 motorway (Sredanci). The seasonal traffic volume variation ranges from a 28% increase on the busiest, Ivanja RekaRugvica, section to a 75% volume increase, as <b>measured</b> <b>on</b> the ŽupanjaSpačva section. Average summer season traffic volume increase on the motorway is 55%. The AADT/ASDT ratio analysis does not include Zagreb bypass, as there are no ASDT data available for the bypass.|$|E
5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted {{by means of}} traffic census at toll stations and reported by Autocesta Rijeka–Zagreb and Hrvatske autoceste—the operators of the northern and the southern portions of the motorway respectively. The reported traffic volume gradually decreases as the motorway chainage increases and as it passes by various major destinations and the interchanges that serve them. Thus the greatest volume of traffic is registered between Jastrebarsko and Lučko interchanges – with 31,432 vehicle annual average daily traffic (AADT), and 53,216 vehicle average summer daily traffic (ASDT) figures as that is the section closest to Zagreb. South of the Bosiljevo2 interchange the first major drop of traffic volume is recorded on the A1 motorway, due to traffic transferring to the A6 motorway towards Rijeka. Other similar changes of the traffic volume are registered near Zadar (served by Zadar1 and Zadar2 interchanges) and Split served by Dugopolje interchange. Substantial variations observed between AADT and ASDT are normally attributed {{to the fact that}} the motorway carries significant tourist traffic. The seasonal increase traffic volume variations ranges 69% on the busiest, Lučko–Jastrebarsko section to 160% as <b>measured</b> <b>on</b> Sveti Rok–Maslenica section.

5|$|Until September 8, Typhoon Babe was {{forecast}} {{to continue}} northwestward into Taiwan and later China; however, another upper-level trough moved into northeastern China and further weakened the ridge. This in turn allowed {{a new area}} of low pressure to develop over the Korean Peninsula and cause Babe to curve northeastward. While moving northeastward, Babe gradually weakened and began to undergo a Fujiwhara-like interaction with the low near Korea as that system moved southwestward. Accelerating along a counter-clockwise arc, Babe moved through the Ryukyu Islands as a weakening typhoon on September 9 before taking a steady westward course into China. As the system passed through the archipelago, a pressure of 907.3 mbar (hPa; 26.80 inHg) was <b>measured</b> <b>on</b> Okinoerabujima.
