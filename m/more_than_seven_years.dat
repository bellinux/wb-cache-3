Ahmose reportedly devoted a tenth of all the productive output towards the service of the traditional gods, reviving massive monumental constructions as well as the arts. However, as the defeat of the Hyksos occurred relatively late in Ahmose's reign, his subsequent building program likely lasted no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years,</b> and much of what was started was probably finished by his son and successor Amenhotep I.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious explores how sex {{trafficking}} {{differs from}} country to country, and suggests that all the victims are both psychologically and emotionally enslaved. One of the initial assertions in the film is that slavery has not been abolished but is increasing, and that half of this slavery is sexual in nature. Nefarious identifies political corruption and difficult socioeconomic situations as elements that prevent sex slaves from escaping exploitation, and suggests that most victims do not survive for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> after initially being trafficked. While the violent acquisition of sex slaves depicted in the first sequence of the film does occur in reality, Jimmy Stewart of Charisma wrote that most girls who are sexually trafficked in Europe are recruited through a fraudulent offer of employment and an improved lifestyle overseas, neither of which ultimately materializes in the new country.|$|E
5|$|In February 1946, Mutual {{introduced}} a quiz show, Twenty Questions, that would run for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years.</b> In October, the detective series Let George Do It, starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; {{it would also}} run into the mid-1950s. For two years, starting in 1946 as well, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show Smile Time, out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: Kate Smith Speaks, at noon, and Kate Smith Sings, later in the hour. The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet, Please, which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, Box 13, which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.|$|E

40|$|Data {{communication}} {{rates have}} increased tremendously {{over the past}} 5 years {{in order to accommodate}} the exponential growth in data transmission. It is common today to have serial data streams in storage area networks that exceed 2 Gb/s and it is expected that high-speed serial signals in backplanes will reach 6. 25 Gb/s in 2003. Consequently, the minimum pulse width of these serial data streams have decreased to less than 500 ps, reducing the noise margin significantly. Insuring signal integrity at these data rates has become increasingly difficult for designers and engineers of systems and components. This paper will provide an overview of signal integrity and the associated measurement instruments that enable designers and engineers to fully characterize high-speed serial or parallel communication systems. This paper will focus on the information that can be obtained from eye diagrams and the importance of quantifying the various components of jitter in order to diagnose and eliminate design problems. Other topics in this paper include: how to measure jitter output and jitter tolerance for design characterization and compliance on systems and components, how to generate and verify various jitter components, why peak-to-peak and rms values alone are not good metrics for quantifying jitter. Actual test setups and methods for applications such as Fibre Channel, Gigabit Ethernet, Infiniband, PCI Express, XAUI, LVDS and clocks/oscillators will be discussed.
