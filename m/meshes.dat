5|$|Lactifluus volemus {{is closely}} related to L.corrugis, and {{generally}} similar in appearance. L.corrugis usually has more surface wrinkles, darker gills, weaker or absent scent, and less orange colouration; however, intermediate colour forms can be found. The two can be distinguished more definitively by microscopic characteristics: L.corrugis has larger spores—typically 10.4–12.8 by 9.6–11.8µm—with a coarser surface reticulum, and larger pleurocystidia. The species Lactifluus austrovolemus {{is closely related}}, but has more crowded gills, while L.lamprocystidiatus can only be reliably distinguished from L.volemus by microscopic characteristics: the reticulations on its spores are taller and more acute, and the <b>meshes</b> formed by the intersections of the reticulations are smaller. Both L.austrovolemus and L.lamprocystidiatus are known only from Papua New Guinea. Lactifluus hygrophoroides also resembles L.volemus, but differs in having widely spaced gills, and spores that lack surface reticulations.|$|E

One <b>mesh</b> period is defined as an angular displacement of the pinion experiencing a double-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration and a single-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration. For double-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> durations, 4, 6 and 8 <b>mesh</b> periods have <b>mesh</b> stiffness reduction caused by slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. The maximum averaged <b>mesh</b> stiffness reduction in a double-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration is 1.57 %, 4.26 % and 19.02 % corresponding to slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. While for single-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> durations, 3, 5 and 7 <b>mesh</b> periods experience <b>mesh</b> stiffness reduction corresponding to slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. The maximum averaged <b>mesh</b> stiffness reduction in a single-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration is 11.61 %, 55.33 % and 55.83 % related to slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. For each <b>mesh</b> period, the stiffness reduction in the single-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration is larger than that in the double-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration for two reasons: (a) the pitting mostly appear around the pitch line and the pitch line lies on the single-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration, and (b) the perfect gear has a smaller averaged <b>mesh</b> stiffness in the single-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration than the double-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration.

50|$|A shared <b>mesh</b> (also {{known as}} ‘traditional’ or ‘best effort’ <b>mesh)</b> is a {{wireless}} <b>mesh</b> network {{that uses a}} single radio to communicate via <b>mesh</b> backhaul links to all the neighboring nodes in the <b>mesh.</b> This is a first generation <b>mesh</b> where the total available bandwidth of the radio channel is ‘shared’ between all the neighboring nodes in the <b>mesh.</b> The capacity of the channel is further consumed by traffic being forwarded from one node to the next in the <b>mesh</b> - reducing the end to end traffic that can be passed. Because bandwidth is shared amongst all nodes in the <b>mesh,</b> and because every link in the <b>mesh</b> uses additional capacity, this type of network offers much lower end to end transmission rates than a switched <b>mesh</b> and degrades in capacity as nodes {{are added to the}} <b>mesh.</b>|$|R

The second grid (and so on for any other grids, 3rd, 4th, etc.) is a relatively much finer mesh that spans a sub-domain of the system containing the region that requires fine resolution like the channel pore. The Poisson equation is first solved on the coarse mesh with all the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, {{taking into account the}} applied bias. Next the boundary conditions for the secondary <b>meshes</b> are obtained by interpolating from the first or previous solutions of the Poisson equation.

It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which <b>meshes</b> with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare failure and {{complication}} rates in patients who underwent a trocar-guided vaginal <b>mesh</b> repair with either a non-absorbable or a partially absorbable <b>mesh.</b> METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from consecutive women undergoing either non-absorbable or partially absorbable <b>mesh</b> for symptomatic stage 2 prolapse or higher were evaluated at 12 months. Outcome measures included objective and subjective failure rates, patient's satisfaction, complications and perioperative outcomes. RESULTS: Five hundred and sixty-nine women (347 with non-absorbable <b>mesh,</b> 222 with partially absorbable <b>mesh)</b> were included. Failure rates were similar in the two groups; the re-operation rate in the untreated compartments was higher in the non-absorbable <b>mesh</b> group compared with the partially absorbable <b>mesh</b> group (5 % vs 1 %). <b>Mesh</b> exposure rate in the non-absorbable <b>mesh</b> group was 12 % and in the partially absorbable <b>mesh</b> group it was 5 %.

40|$|Wireless <b>mesh</b> {{networks}} (WMNs) {{consist of}} {{two kinds of}} nodes: <b>mesh</b> routers which form the backbones of WMNs and <b>mesh</b> clients which associate with <b>mesh</b> routers to access networks. Because of the discrepancy between <b>mesh</b> routers and <b>mesh</b> clients, WMNs have a hybrid structure. Their hybrid structure presents an opportunity to integrate WMNs with different networks such as wireless LAN, Bluetooth and sensor networks through bridging functions in <b>mesh</b> routers. Because {{of the ability to}} integrate various networks, WMNs are a potential candidate for ubiquitous networks. Organizing the WMNs to integrate heterogeneous networks requires two level of routing: routing tables for backbones between <b>mesh</b> routers, and association tables for linking <b>mesh</b> clients to <b>mesh</b> routers. In order to organize routing tables containing the computerd paths between <b>mesh</b> routers, <b>mesh</b> routers execute <b>mesh</b> routing protocols. However, the information in these routing tables is insufficient to find paths between <b>mesh</b> clients because they do not execute routing protocols. Hence, to complement routing tables, we store information about <b>mesh</b> clients in ``association tables'' indicating which <b>mesh</b> client is reachable by which router. To organize the association tables for all <b>mesh</b> clients, <b>mesh</b> routers should run an additional protocol. The association discovery protocol (ADP) that we propose operates efficiently.
