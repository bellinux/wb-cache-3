In this new venture, he got excellent support from the manager K.P. Varadachari and his lawyer friend Thoothukudi Govindachari Raghavachari. Some of AVM's early productions were dramas on mythological subjects like Ramayanam.|$|E

The FAA report stated “There is no record of warranty claim by GEAE for defective material and no record of any credit for GEAE processed by Alcoa or TIMET”. [...] GE records of the second disk having the serial number of the crash disk indicate that it was made with an RMI titanium billet supplied by Alcoa. Research of GE records showed no other titanium parts were manufactured at GE from this RMI titanium billet {{during the period of}} 1969 to 1990. GE records indicate that final finishing and inspection of the crash disk were completed on December 11, 1971. Alcoa records indicate that this RMI titanium billet was first cut in 1972 and that all forgings made from this material were for airframe parts. [...] If the Alcoa records were accurate, the RMI titanium could not have been used to manufacture the crash disk, indicating that the initially rejected TIMET disk with “an unsatisfactory ultrasonic indication” was the crash disk. [...] CF6 engines like that containing the crash disk were used to power many civilian and military aircraft {{at the time of the}} crash. Due to concerns that the accident could recur, a large number of disks that were in service were examined by ultrasound for indications of defects. At least two “sister disks” were found to have defects like that of the crash disk. Prioritization and efficiency of inspections of the many engines under suspicion would have been aided by determination of the titanium source of the crash disk. Chemical analyses of the crash disk intended to determine its source were inconclusive. The NTSB report stated that if examined disks were not from the same source, “the records on a large number of GEAE disks are suspect. It also means that any AD (Airworthiness Directive) action that is based on the serial number of a disk could fail to have its intended effect because suspect disks could remain in service.” [...] The FAA report did not explicitly address the impact of these uncertainties on operations of military aircraft that might have contained a suspect disk.|$|E

An association between the manufacturing process of Björk-Shiley convexo-concave valves and the risk of fracture has been suggested. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine which items from the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>records,</b> in addition to known risk factors, were predictive of fracture of large 60 -degree Björk-Shiley convexo-concave mitral valves. Methods: All Dutch recipients (n = 2264) of Björk-Shiley convexo-concave valves were followed up until fracture, death, reoperation, or end of the study (July 1, 1996). Information was abstracted from the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>records</b> of large 60 -degree Björk-Shiley convexo- concave mitral valves (n = 655) in Dutch recipients and included items that described the manufacturing process and items for which an association with strut fracture had been suggested. <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>records</b> were available for 637 valves (97 %), including 25 fractured valves. Results: Multivariate analysis identified age at implantation (hazard ratio 0. 95, 95 % confidence interval 0. 93 - 0. 97), lot size (< 175 valves versus ≥ 175 valves; hazard ratio 6. 6, 95 % confidence interval 2. 2 - 20. 1), number of hook deflection tests performed (0 or 1 versus ≥ 2; hazard ratio 4. 7, 95 % confidence interval 1. 4 - 16. 2), number of disks that were used (1 versus ≥ 2; hazard ratio 5. 9, 95 % confidence interval 1. 9 - 18. 5), and lot fracture percentage (hazard ratio 1. 6, 95 % confidence interval 1. 4 - 1. 8) as independent {{predictors of}} fracture. Although the added predictive value of a model with these 5 variables was sizable compared with a model containing age only, it was only slightly better than a model with age, lot size, and lot fracture percentage. Conclusion: If the serial number of a large 60 -degree Björk-Shiley convexo-concave mitral valve is known, manufacturing information can add significantly to the prediction of fracture. Information on lot size and lot fracture percentage should be made available to clinicians for risk assessment of prophylactic explantation. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1999; 117 : 766 - 75...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the methods {{by which the}} Newfoundland population provided themselves with the warmth essential to survival, from the seventeenth century onwards. The provision of warmth was crucial to life on the island. It underlay all other activities and imposed its patterns on such fundamental geographical properties as the development of settlement and ecology. Two main components of creating this warmth were firewood from local forests and the cast iron stove, {{both of which are}} discussed here. Local forest resources were the staple fuel for much of the Newfoundland population. They were a fundamental component of seasonal work patterns and of the cashless subsistence economy. Three potential types of fuel wood shortages are identified, {{and the extent to which}} each may have occurred in Newfoundland is discussed. The adoption of the new technology of the cast iron stove is also examined, from its first appearance in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to its common acceptance in homes by 1870. A variety of sources contribute to a preliminary picture of the heating and cooking technology used, and of the utilization of fuel wood resources. These include such archival sources as merchant ledgers and local <b>manufacturing</b> <b>records,</b> as well as published sources like censuses and newspaper advertisements.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Björk-Shiley 60 ° convexo-concave {{prosthetic}} {{heart valves}} (Shiley, Inc, Irvine, Calif, {{a subsidiary of}} Pfizer, Inc) {{continue to be a}} concern for approximately 35, 000 nonexplanted patients worldwide, with approximately 600 events reported to the manufacturer to date. Fractures of the outlet struts of the valves began to appear in the early 1980 s and have continued to the present, but their causes are only partially understood. Methods: A matched case-control study was conducted evaluating <b>manufacturing</b> <b>records</b> for 52 valves with outlet strut fractures and 248 control subjects matched for age at implantation, valve size, and valve position. Results: In addition to the risk factors recognized as determinants of outlet strut fracture, the United Kingdom case-control study has observed 7 - to 9 -fold increased risk with performance of multiple hook deflection tests. This test was performed more than once, usually after rework on the valve. Six valves in this study underwent multiple hook deflection tests, of which 4 experienced an outlet strut fracture. Cracks and further rework were noted for these valves. Significant associations were also observed between outlet strut fracture and disc-to-strut gap measurements taken before the attachment of the sewing ring. Conclusions: It is our view that a combination of factors related to valve design, manufacturing process, and patient characteristics are responsible for outlet strut fractures of Björk-Shiley convexo-concave valves. Multiple hook deflection tests have emerged as a potential new risk factor for outlet strut fracture in both The Netherlands and the United Kingdom. This factor appears to be correlated with the presence of other abnormalities. A further study is needed to investigate the factors correlated with multiple hook deflection tests. On confirmation of risk, the presence of multiple hook deflection tests may be added to equations, quantifying the risk of outlet strut fracture for comparison against risk of mortality and serious morbidity from explant operations.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} the work {{carried out to}} develop a prototype knowledge-based system 'KBS-SETUPP' to generate process plans for the manufacture of seamless tubes. The work is specifically related to a plant in which hollows are made from solid billets using a rotary piercing process and then reduced to required size and finished properties using the fixed plug cold drawing process. The thesis first discusses various methods of tube production {{in order to give}} a general background of tube manufacture. Then a review of the automation of the process planning function is presented in terms of its basic sub-tasks and the techniques and suitability of a knowledge-based system is established. In the light of such a review and a case study, the process planning problem is formulated in the domain of seamless tube manufacture, its basic sub-tasks are identified and capabilities and constraints of the available equipment in the specific plant are established. The task of collecting and collating the process planning knowledge in seamless tube manufacture is discussed and is mostly fulfilled from domain experts, analysing of existing <b>manufacturing</b> <b>records</b> specific to plant, textbooks and applicable Standards. For the cold drawing mill, tube-drawing schedules have been rationalised to correspond with practice. The validation of such schedules has been achieved by computing the process parameters and then comparing these with the drawbench capacity to avoid over-loading. The existing models cannot be simulated in the computer program as such, therefore a mathematical model has been proposed which estimates the process parameters which are in close agreement with experimental values established by other researchers. To implement the concepts, a Knowledge-Based System 'KBS- SETUPP' has been developed on Personal Computer using Turbo- Prolog.
