40|$|Industrial {{technology}} has excelled profoundly {{in the past}} few decades, helping organisations throughout the world to be more efficient in all processes and keeping costs down. However, despite the abundance of several IT solutions, there exist many problems where more than one decision has to be made. Among the techniques supporting a multi-decisional context, simulations can undoubtedly play an important role as they provide what-if analysis and hence help to evaluate quantitative benefits. This thesis develops a simulation model for breakdown in an industrial <b>machine,</b> the main <b>crusher</b> in a cement factory. It also examines three important parameters (Drill Head, Dusting and Lubrication) of the <b>crusher</b> <b>machine</b> with the use of Bayesian network modelling which allows determination of suitable influencing factors in a precise and dynamic manner. The model also supports integration with management systems such as J. I. T, and MRPII. Witness simulation software has been used in this work to model the breakdown frequency of the <b>Crusher</b> <b>machine</b> and the associated parameters. The Bayesian Network Modelling is used to consider historical data and expert opinions; the Bayes’ approach takes into consideration off all existing parameters that affect the machine breakdown directly or indirectly. This tool is capable of establishing a probability based on the information gathered about the parameters. The simulation model is developed further to enable the Bayesian Network Modelling to be applied via the Chain Rule to calculate the probability of failure. The findings of this research show the approach developed in this work, where the Bayesian probability development process is integrated into the simulation model. This provides a unique and dynamic tool to aid decision making in understanding machine breakdowns. The resulting simulator is a decision making tool capable of analysing the status of the machine and the associated influencing factors. This uses an approach based on multiple performance measures and a user-defined set of inputs based on historical and expert opinion. This work provides a methodology to study the importance of key parameters of the <b>crusher</b> <b>machine.</b> This in effect highlights the correlation between the governing parameters and the occurrence of breakdown. ...|$|R

This material can be more useful when it converts to organik fertilizer where some other materials were added and mixed thoroughly, and the proccess could be accelerated by activated bacteria. this proccess could made faster if the size of the organic matter is small. Several types of crusher have been designed either by big companies from the industrial countries or small companies like Indonesia. Crushers made by big counties are usually used by big companies. <b>Crusher</b> <b>machines</b> made by small factories that have low capacity, often were often in trouble when the material to be broken have strong and long fiber. In some cases the knives often broke because they were just welded to the axis where the knives rotated. 	This research was aimed to design a <b>crusher</b> <b>machine</b> that could produce a smaller size of plant residus than the other machines could do. The knives consisted of 16 rotary saws. There were 15 spacers made of 0. 5 cm-thick, 15 cm in diameter placed one after another of the knives. To rotate the sharp, a 1. 5 HP electric motor was used with a belt-pulley transmission. A trapezium hopper was installed right over the knive-cylinder. This machine was tested for several source of organic matters like palmoil empty fruit bunch, cassava tree, corn corb, palmoil leaf, and acacia tree. 	The results showed that the material capacity to crush the palmoil empty fruit bunch, cassava tree, corn corb, palmoil leaf, and another tree (angsana tree) were 154, 6 kg/jam, 172, 4 kg/jam, 163, 2 kg/jam, 67 kg/jam, dan 160, 4 kg/jam in subsequently. There was no regular shape of crushed material except for palmoil empty fruit bunch. For the palmoil empty fruit bunch, 	the product formed a long fiber and small size material like sand. Generally, the machine was able to operate without worrying of knives would break. Keywords: Plants residus, <b>crushing</b> <b>machine,</b> material capacity...|$|R
