40|$|A Planar Motion Mechanism (PMM) is an {{electromechanical}} device used to conduct manoeuvring studies and experiments on scale models of ships. <b>A</b> PMM <b>moves</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> model in exact pre-programmed patterns while resulting forces and moments are measured using a force dynamometer {{attached to the}} model. From these studies, manoeuvring derivatives can be calculated and then used to estimate or simulate motions of the full-scale vessel. In 1995, the National Research Council 2 ̆ 019 s Institute for Ocean Technology (NRC-IOT) developed a PMM for its Towing Tank to measure hydrodynamic derivatives {{and then tried to}} extend the device to measuring ice-induced manoeuvring forces as part of a new research effort for icebreaking vessels. Using this device in the Ice Tank highlighted strength limitations associated with the mechanism. In 2007 Cussons Technology Ltd (CTL), of Manchester was contracted by NRC-IOT to design and fabricate a new PMM, capable of both hydrodynamic manoeuvring studies and ice manoeuvring studies. This paper describes the development and implementation processes of the PMM from initial specification to design, manufacture, test/commissioning, and finally model testing at NRC-IOT. The paper illustrates the improved performance of the new PMM, which paves the way for an expanded NRC-IOT research program related to in-ice manoeuvring. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
50|$|An upwind vessel {{is able to}} {{manoeuvre}} at will toward any downwind point, {{since in}} doing so the relative wind <b>moves</b> aft. <b>A</b> <b>vessel</b> downwind of another, however, in attempting to attack upwind, is constrained to trim sail as the relative wind moves forward and cannot point too far into the wind {{for fear of being}} headed. In sailing warfare, when beating to windward, the vessel experiences heeling under the sideward pressure of the wind. This restricts gunnery, as cannon on the windward side are now elevated, while the leeward gun ports aim into the sea, or in heavy weather may be awash. A ship with the weather gage, turning downwind to attack, may alter course at will in order to bring starboard and port guns to appropriate elevations. Ships seeking to evade capture or attack, however, have the advantage being downwind if they are faster vessels or are close to friendly land.|$|R
6000|$|In {{about ten}} weeks time, I {{was able to}} {{understand}} most of his questions; and in three months, could give him some tolerable answers. He was extremely curious to know “from {{what part of the}} country I came, and how I was taught to imitate a rational creature; because the Yahoos (whom he saw I exactly resembled in my head, hands, and face, that were only visible), with some appearance of cunning, and the strongest disposition to mischief, were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes.” I answered, “that I came over the sea, from a far place, with many others of my own kind, in <b>a</b> great hollow <b>vessel</b> made of the bodies of trees: that my companions forced me to land on this coast, and then left me to shift for myself.” It was with some difficulty, and by the help of many signs, that I brought him to understand me. He replied, “that I must needs be mistaken, or that I said the thing which was not;” for they have no word in their language to express lying or falsehood. “He knew it was impossible {{that there could be a}} country beyond the sea, or that a parcel of brutes could <b>move</b> <b>a</b> wooden <b>vessel</b> whither they pleased upon water.

40|$|AbstractIt {{has long}} been known that {{platelets}} undergo margination when flowing in blood vessels, such that there is an excess concentration near the vessel wall. We conduct experiments and three-dimensional boundary integral simulations of platelet-sized spherical particles in a microchannel 30 μm in height to measure the particle-concentration distribution profile and observe its margination at 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % red blood cell hematocrit. The experiments involved adding 2. 15 -μm-diameter spheres into a solution of red blood cells, plasma, and water and flowing this mixture down a microfluidic channel at a wall shear rate of 1000 s− 1. Fluorescence imaging was used to determine the height and velocity of particles in the channel. Experimental results indicate that margination has largely occurred before particles travel 1  cm downstream and that hematocrit plays a role in the degree of margination. With simulations, we can track the trajectories of the particles with higher resolution. These simulations also confirm that margination from an initially uniform distribution of spheres and red blood cells occurs over the length scale of O(1  cm), with higher hematocrit showing faster margination. The results presented here, from both experiments and 3 D simulations, may help explain the relationship between bleeding time in vessel trauma and red blood cell hematocrit as platelets <b>move</b> to <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> wall...|$|R
50|$|Trenching barges {{are used}} to {{excavate}} a trench on the seabed for a pipeline or cable to protect and stabilise it. Infilling is usually left to the natural action of the water on the seabed. The actual excavation is done by a sled which may use water jets, airlifts or mechanical plough systems to remove material and form the trench. This is generally done by towing the sled along using the pipeline to guide it after the pipeline is in position. The trench is progressively excavated under the pipeline, which sags into it as it is formed. Motion of the trenching barge is generally controlled by heaving in on the forward anchors and slacking away the stern anchors, which will periodically be <b>moved</b> by <b>a</b> service <b>vessel.</b> Diving tasks may include inspection of the pipeline and trench, including measurements where applicable, setting the sled and dealing with {{problems which may arise}} during the trenching operation.|$|R

Data on physical and chemical characteristics of the water column are collected during transects along which several consecutive casts of the MVP are conducted. The MVP was deployed during the Amundsen scientific expeditions, {{in the summer and}} fall of 2014 to 2016. The components of the system varied slightly throughout the year but typically included a Micro CTD (Temperature, Conductivity and Pressure), a Micro DO 2 (Dissolved Oxygen), a Micro SV (Sound velocity and Pressure) and an ECOFLO (Fluorescence) and a C-Star (Transmittance) probe. The MVP data were corrected and then controlled by comparing them to CTD-Rosette and thermosalinograph (TSG) data when available. Variables are provided for every decibar (dbar) between the maximum and minimum pressure recorded for each cast. Detailed metadata and reports are included to provide more information...|$|R
