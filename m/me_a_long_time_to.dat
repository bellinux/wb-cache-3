500|$|On November 24, 2014, Sandoval [...] {{came to an}} {{agreement}} with the Boston Red Sox on a five-year, $90 million contract with a sixth year club option of $17 million or a $5 million buy-out. The deal was officially announced on November 25. Sandoval said, [...] "It was a tough decision for me. It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> be sure that I was going to make the right decision... But I want a new challenge. I made that choice to be here in Boston because I need a new challenge." [...] In 126 games of 2015, Sandoval batted [...]245 with 10 home runs and 47 RBI, all career lows since his first full season in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|In a February 10, 2007 {{article on}} Yahoo! Sports, Jackson says that: [...] "It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{get over the}} fact that I {{was the only one that}} didn't make it to the NBA from the Fab Five, but I'm over it because I'm back home and I'm happy with what I'm doing with my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tiffany {{was created}} as a new love {{interest}} for established character; Chris Warner. Alison James, who had theatre background, was cast in the role. After appearing on the show for three years, James decided to quit and the character was killed off. She stated, [...] "It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> decide to leave Shortland Street because it isn't easy {{to walk away from}} something you love. I also had this fear I'd never get work again – it's a real fear. So it took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> wrestle with the idea that saying no to work wasn't unwise, and that if you actually want to grow and develop as an actor you do have to stop and move on." [...] She found her final scenes draining, [...] "Everyone was acting around me and I was there, but my acting had basically stopped. I remember lying there thinking, 'I’m going to miss all these people.' I was quite teary, actually." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Stephen," [...] she pleaded, [...] "I am sorry--to {{be such a}} fool--but {{this thing}} has lived with <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> and--would you go away? It would be kindest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Miss Pillenger, {{you have}} been with <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> now. Six years, is it not? Six years. Well, well. I don't think I have ever made you a little present, have I?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don’t {{want to do}} that," [...] was the {{growling}} reply. [...] "They’ve {{been with}} <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> and they’re all good men. Why don’t they have a go at you, I wonder?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Reflecting in 1993 on his {{relatively}} late {{start in}} writing fiction, DeLillo said [...] "I wish I had started earlier, but evidently I wasn’t ready. First, I lacked ambition. I {{may have had}} novels in my head but very little on paper and no personal goals, no burning desire to achieve some end. Second, I didn’t {{have a sense of}} {{what it takes to be}} a serious writer. It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> develop this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Levy {{has said}} that his views on Israel's {{policies}} toward the Palestinians developed only after joining Haaretz. [...] "When I first started covering the West Bank for Haaretz, I was young and brainwashed," [...] {{he said in an}} interview. [...] "I would see settlers cutting down olive trees and soldiers mistreating Palestinian women at the checkpoints, and I would think, 'These are exceptions, not part of government policy.' It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> see that these were not exceptions – they were the substance of government policy." ...|$|E
2500|$|From August to October 2006, Lisa Mitchell rose to {{national}} prominence as a contestant on Australian Idol Season 4, performing cover versions {{and two of}} her own compositions, which were [...] "See It in Your Eyes" [...] and [...] "Too Far Gone". Mitchell had auditioned in Albury in April, aged 16, and moved through the selection process to the final six before being eliminated in mid-October. In June 2009 Mitchell reflected on her time on Australian Idol: [...] "I was uncomfortable with elements of the show and unhappy about the compromises sometimes. I didn’t know what I wanted with music but I did know that I loved it. I think {{that was what the}} experience cemented. It’s taken <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> find my own way. But I never went back to school".|$|E

6000|$|... "But he did ask <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> ago, you know, papa," [...] Elma put in demurely. [...] "And at that time, you remember, you {{objected to}} the match; so of course, as in duty bound, I at once refused him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't you understand, Freddie? You've known <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> I {{should have}} thought {{that you would have}} found out by now that I have a certain amount of pride. If Derek wanted me back, there was only one thing for him to do--come over and find me himself." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sundfør {{released}} her fourth studio album, Ten Love Songs, on 16 February 2015. The album showcased Sundfør experimenting {{with an electronic}} dance pop sound alongside textured orchestral arrangements. The album {{was considered to be}} Sundfør's international breakthrough, while also debuting at number one in Norway, receiving universal acclaim from music critics and appearing on various year-end lists. She later went on tour in promotion of the album. Sundfør has stated that after she finished the album she became ill, both physically and mentally: [...] "I was getting flu all the time. Depression, anxiety. It's taken <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get back again. I was wobbling and...I'm still struggling with it." [...] She believes this was partly a result of almost every aspect of the album's making, including production, composition, mixing and recording, which she mostly worked on by herself, but also {{as a result of the}} album's themes, [...] "in which she delved into her own life to examine the links between extreme love and violent hatred." [...] It was shortly after when she began work on Music for People in Trouble.|$|E
2500|$|... "Tumble and Fall", {{the third}} track on Pushing the Senses, {{was chosen as}} its lead single, because their European label Play it Again Sam (PIAS), were getting more {{involved}} with the band, believing the song would be a crossover to make them successful in Europe after touring with Coldplay in 2003. The single became the band's most successful single release since [...] "Buck Rogers", reaching the top five in the UK. Grant claimed that [...] "Tumble and Fall" [...] is a love song, but can be interpreted in any way. In an interview with Feederweb, Grant said of the song: [...] "Again {{this is about the}} ups and downs of life. Its about life in general and how you deal with it. It covers the journey of life and how you have to take the ups with the downs. I wasn’t going to record this song. It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> finish it, to be happy with it, because the song went through various stages. I wasn’t sure if we really needed a tune like that on the album. But I decided to go to the studio to record an acoustic version just to see what happened and that’s how the song started. It was a completely one take vocal, live with the acoustic guitar and we built everything else around it. It is an acoustic track that grew into what it is now. So that was the only song that we recorded like that on the album, so it is a bit different for that reason and is probably why it has an organic feel to it".|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Catesby smiled. [...] "It’ll take <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{thank you}} as I ought to thank you," [...] he murmured. [...] "And then I want to apologise; that’ll take time, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh {{we shall}} meet before that. I shall do what I can, but upon my word I feel, you know," [...] he laughed, [...] "that such a tuning-up as YOU'VE given me will last <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> It's like the high Alps." [...] Then {{with his hand}} out again he added: [...] "Have you any plans yourself?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'You knew <b>me,</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before I {{came here}} and was changed, Mr. Copperfield,' said Uriah, looking at me; and a more villainous look I never saw, even on his visage. 'You knew me when, {{in spite of my}} follies, I was umble among them that was proud, and meek among them that was violent--you was violent to me yourself, Mr. Copperfield. Once, you struck <b>me</b> <b>a</b> blow in the face, you know.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It takes <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{figure a}} thing out," [...] he said; [...] "and when I've {{a problem to}} solve {{a bit of a}} snooze helps wonderfully. Patsy, dear, it occurs to me we're lonely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, as I've {{only just}} arrived," [...] she remarked, [...] "I might be forgiven if I {{do not change}} my skirt. I packed so hurriedly {{that it will take}} <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> find my things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I daresay; {{but just}} now I {{feel that it}} would take <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get tired of it, if it were all as charming as today. Everything loves June. Davy-boy, why this melancholy November face in blossom-time?" ...|$|E
60|$|My aunt, whose {{spirits are}} always {{affected}} by bad weather, kept <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> in her sitting-room, amusing herself by making me exercise my sight. Oscar was present by special invitation, and assisted {{the old lady}} in setting this new seeing-sense of mine all sorts of tasks. He tried hard to prevail on me to let him see my writing. I refused. It is improving {{as fast as it}} can; but it is not good enough yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got {{something}} on my mind," [...] said Mr. Heard, with a diabolical {{glance at the}} mate--"something wot's been worrying <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> I've been deceiving you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And as you've known <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> you know,' said Mr Toots, 'let me {{assure you}} that {{she is one of}} the most {{remarkable}} women that ever lived.' ...|$|R

60|$|The mason called insatiably {{for more}} brick, more mortar, and the chimney (the only outside chimney in Hamilton township) rose grandly, alarmingly above the roof--whilst I gained a {{reputation}} for princely expenditure which it will take <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> live down.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay, Genie," [...] said Abdallah. [...] "Whilst {{thou art}} here thou mayest as well give me enough {{at once to}} last <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> come. Let me have eleven more caskets of money like this one, and eleven more slaves to carry the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he {{repeated}} softly, [...] "I don't understand myself. You've known <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> Andrew. You wouldn't write me down as altogether a sentimental ass, would you?" ...|$|R
60|$|The old {{man looked}} at <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before he spoke. There was a puzzled {{expression}} upon his wrinkled face, and a look of hurt sorrow in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Now, though I {{had enough}} to subsist <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> yet despairing of a sudden deliverance, or that both {{ammunition}} and provision might be spent before such a thing happened, I coveted as much as I could; and {{so long as the}} ship remained in that condition, I daily brought away one necessary or other; particularly the rigging, sails, and cordage, some twine, a barrel of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel of meal, 3 calks of rum, &, what indeed was most welcome to <b>me,</b> <b>a</b> whole hogshead of bread.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘There’s nothing,’ said Toby, ‘more regular in its coming round than dinner-time, {{and nothing}} less regular in its coming round than dinner. That’s the great {{difference}} between ’em. It’s took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> find it out. I wonder {{whether it would}} be worth any gentleman’s while, now, to buy that obserwation for the Papers; or the Parliament!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it {{will take}} <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> find out!" [...] she said, rather ruefully; and she could promise me this {{satisfaction}} neither for that night nor for the next. I was patient now, however, for I felt that I had only to wait; and in fact {{at the end of}} the week, one lovely evening after dinner, she stepped into my gondola, to which in honor of the occasion I had attached a second oar.|$|E
6000|$|You {{will not}} regard me as a madman, I am sure. It {{is a very}} {{rational}} aberration at least {{to try to put}} your beliefs into practice. Strangely enough, it has taken <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> see this distinctly with regard to my whole creed; but I have seen it at last, praised be my sickness and my leisure! I have seen it at last; the sun of my duty has risen; I have enlisted for the first time, and after long coquetting with the shilling, under the banner of the Holy Ghost![10] ...|$|E

"I {{know how}} hard {{everyone}} in that locker room worked to get themselves in position to win that game today and for it to end like that, and {{for me to be}} the cause is very tough to swallow right now", Romo said after the game. [...] "I take responsibility for messing up at the end there. That's my fault. I cost the Dallas Cowboys a playoff win, and it's going to sit with <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> I don't know if I have ever felt this low." ...|$|R
5000|$|Drummer Ginger Baker {{recalled}} how the album's title {{was based on}} a malapropism which alluded to 19th-century British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli: You know how the title came about - Disraeli Gears - yeah? We had this Austin Westminster, and Mick Turner was one of the roadies who'd been with <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> and he was driving along and Eric Clapton was talking about getting a racing bicycle. Mick, driving, went 'Oh yeah - Disraeli gears!' meaning derailleur gears...We all just fell over...We said that's got to be the album title.|$|R
5000|$|Borland writes {{songs by}} forming them in rough {{outlines}} and {{filling in the}} details later. According to Borland, [...] "I'm good at creating ideas while using a guitar in a new way, but it takes <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> I can't just come up with stuff fast and rip it up. I think about constructing songs, and even riffs, {{in the same way}} as a painting, putting on a little bit at a time. They're sketchy at first, and then I know what I want, and I fit notes into places." ...|$|R
