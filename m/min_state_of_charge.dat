40|$|In the UK power system, {{there is}} {{currently}} no battery energy storage system (BESS) for providing grid-scale frequency response. However, according to the UK future energy plan, with a high penetration of renewable energy sources, battery technologies have become increasingly attractive to provide firm frequency response (FFR). This paper estimates the current and future balancing requirement of National Grid UK. A methodology for the economic optimization of the parameters of LiFePO 4 BESSs is proposed to achieve the lowest tender price in the UK FFR market. The economic analysis is performed based on the estimated battery lifetime and the UK frequency regulation market. Results {{suggest that it is}} profitable to deploy BESSs in the UK market. The lowest tender price obtained was £ 17. 4012 /MW/h, which is already lower than many successfully tendered prices from FFR providers. By considering the future UK energy scenarios, a BESS with an energy/power ratio around 0. 43, energy offset interval <b>of</b> 20 <b>min</b> and <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> set-point = 50 - 60 % is shown to be the optimal choice...|$|R

30|$|The {{method used}} in this paper to measure the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> {{is based on the}} Coulomb {{counting}} method, which measures the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> according to the integral of the current [52]. This method, although accurate, is sensitive to the initial value <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge.</b> The final goal with speed profile optimization in this paper is to implement it in a form of a driver advisory system on-board the train (such as the one presented Ghaviha et al. [17]). There are already battery systems available with battery modules that take advantage of sophisticated electrochemical battery models to monitor the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> with high accuracy. Such systems are usually provided by the battery supplier. A driver advisory system based on the approach presented here will be used together with such battery management system on-board the train and will take the initial value <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> from it.|$|R

30|$|We used charge {{taken from}} the battery as the {{objective}} function instead of the energy consumption in kWh. The results of a comparison between the two approaches show that, in general, the application <b>of</b> the battery <b>charge</b> as the objective function provides more energy-efficient speed profiles {{in comparison with the}} method with the energy consumption in kWh as the objective. Moreover, the dynamic programming approach used in this paper considers the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> as a <b>state</b> variable. Having the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> as a <b>state</b> variable facilitates handling different constraints that come from the specific behavior of the batteries in different <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge.</b> This is particularly important as it provides the opportunity to apply the same optimization approach for the energy storage devices with a behavior more dependent on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|R

30|$|The voltage of {{the battery}} {{used for the}} IPEMU project, however, is {{relatively}} stable {{with respect to the}} <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge.</b> Moreover, the designed motor converter module in the IPEMU train can handle the voltage fluctuations of the designed battery and keep the same tractive effort curve. Therefore, one tractive effort curve is used in this research. Furthermore, dynamic programming is known to be suitable for handling the constraints on state variables [17]. In the dynamic programming approach used in this paper, <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> is assumed as a state variable. Therefore, the constraints related to the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> can be handled by this approach (such as the constraint on the battery capacity, i.e., Eq. (5)).

40|$|Today's {{automotive}} industry is undergoing {{significant changes in}} technology due to economic, political and environmental pressures. The shift from conventional internal combustion vehicles to hybrid and plug in hybrid electric vehicles brings with it a new host of technical challenges. As the vehicles become more electrified, and the batteries become larger, there are many difficulties facing the battery integration including both embedded control and supervisory control. A very important aspect of Li-Ion battery integration is the <b>state</b> estimation <b>of</b> the battery. <b>State</b> estimation can include multiple states, however {{the two most important}} are the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> and <b>state</b> <b>of</b> health of the battery. Determining an accurate <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> estimation <b>of</b> a battery has been an important part of consumer electronics for years now [1]. In small portable electronics, the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the battery is used to determine the time remaining on the current battery charge. Although difficult, the estimation is simplified by the relatively low charge and discharge currents (approximately + 3 C) of the devices and the non-dynamic duty cycle. Hybrid vehicle battery packs can reach much higher charge and discharge currents (+ 20 C) [2]. This higher current combined with a very dynamic duty cycle, large changes in temperature, longer periods without usage and long life requirements make <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> estimation in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) much more difficult. There have been a host of methods employed by various previous authors. One of the most important factors in <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> estimation is having an accurate estimation of the actual capacity (depending on <b>state</b> <b>of</b> health) of the battery at any time [3]. Without having an understanding <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> health of the battery, the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> estimation can vary greatly. This paper proposes a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> and <b>state</b> <b>of</b> health estimation based on a dual Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Employing an EKF for the <b>state</b> estimation <b>of</b> the battery pack not only allows for enhanced accuracy of the estimation but allows the control engineer to develop vehicle performance criteria based not only on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> estimation, but also the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> health...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is the conceptual design of a battery management system for the first prototype of the UWC (University of the Western Cape) Modular Battery System. The battery system is a lithium-ion battery that aims {{to be used in}} renewable energy systems and for niche electric vehicles such as golf carts. The concept that is introduced in this thesis comprises the parameter monitoring, the safety management and has its main focus on an accurate <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> estimation. Another battery system that was already implemented is used as base for the parameter monitoring and the safety management for the new battery management system. In contrast to that, the concept for the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> estimation must be developed completely. Different methods for the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> estimation which are based on the measured voltage, current and temperature are discussed, evaluated and the chosen method is conceived in this thesis. The method used for the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> estimation is different for the time when the battery is active than when it is inactive. During charge and discharge Coulomb counting is used and when the cell is inactive voltage versus <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> lookup tables are used to update the estimation. To have an accurate estimation when the cell is inactive only for a short time, a model of the voltage relaxation is used to predict the voltage when the cells are in equilibrium. This allows the algorithm to reset the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> that is estimated by Coulomb counting – which tends to have a growing error over time – frequently. To evaluate the accuracy of the voltage prediction, cell tests were executed where the voltage relaxation was sampled. The recursive least square method to predict the end voltage was tested with a MATLAB programme. With the help <b>of</b> voltage versus <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> lookup tables it was possible to determine the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> accuracy with the accuracy of the voltage prediction...|$|R

The journey consists of constant load phases and multiple charge/discharge phases in which the peak charge and discharge powers were observed. In other words, the full scope of the operation {{is included in the}} validation experiments. The validation experiments cover a range <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> from 85 % to 25 %. The performance of the lithium-ion batteries are relatively stable between around 95 % and 5 % <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge,</b> which is also the recommended operating condition from most of the battery suppliers [44]. Therefore, the validation is acceptable, even though it was done for a specific range <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge.</b> This can also be understood from the results of the validation. Both battery models result in a similar accuracy, which shows that in the IPEMU train, the performance of the battery is relatively stable with respect to the changes in <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge.</b> Moreover, the batteries used for the application of catenary-free operation are sized with the consideration of redundancy for the extreme cases.

For the pure LiCoPO 4 electrode, the two plateaus in the charge curve are at 4.82 and 4.92 V. We have also studied the variation of electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EISs) with the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge.</b> The EIS measurement has shown that the total interfacial resistance increases as the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> increases for the pure LiCoPO 4 electrode.
