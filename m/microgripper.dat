40|$|ABSTRACT: Hydrogels such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (pNI-PAM-AAc) can be photopatterned {{to create}} {{a wide range of}} actuatable and self-folding microstructures. Mechanical motion is derived from the large and {{reversible}} swelling response of this cross-linked hydrogel in varying thermal or pH environments. This action is facilitated by their network structure and capacity for large strain. However, due to the low modulus of such hydrogels, they have limited gripping ability of relevance to surgical excision or robotic tasks such as pick-and-place. Using experiments and modeling, we design, fabricate, and characterize photopatterned, self-folding functional <b>microgrippers</b> that combine a swellable, photo-cross-linked pNIPAM-AAc soft-hydrogel with a nonswellable and stiff segmented polymer (polypropylene fumarate, PPF). We also show that we can embed iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3) nanoparticles into the porous hydrogel layer, allowing the <b>microgrippers</b> to be responsive and remotely guided using magnetic fields. Using finite element models, we investigate the influence of the thickness and the modulus of both the hydrogel and stiff polymer layers on the self-folding characteristics of the <b>microgrippers.</b> Finally, we illustrate operation and functionality of these polymeric <b>microgrippers</b> for soft robotic and surgical applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Piezoelectric {{cantilevers}} {{have proved}} their performances for actuating <b>microgrippers</b> dedicated to micromanipulation and microassembly tasks. While {{the control of}} one degree-of-freedom (dof) piezocantilevers have been well whelmed, the control of multi-dof one has not been addressed. Indeed, to assemble complex structures, the use of multidof <b>microgrippers</b> is recognized. Unfortunately, strong coupling between the axis and nonlinearities indeniably limit their performances. This paper deals with the modeling and control of a piezocantilever that has 2 degrees of freedom: in-plane and out of plane deflections. While such a characteristic allows the <b>microgrippers</b> perform both orientation and translation during micromanipulation/microassembly tasks, the strong coupling between the two dof makes difficult their control. Moreover, nonlinearities (hysteresis and creep) raise when the piezocantilever is used in high deformation.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} and control of a <b>microgripper</b> devoted to micromanipulation and microassembly applications and tasks. Based on two collaborative piezoelectric actuators, the <b>microgripper</b> is typified by a high sensitivity to the environment, in particular a high sensitivity to {{the properties of the}} manipulated objects. This sensitivity makes the behavior of the <b>microgripper</b> variable and uncertain versus the environment and consequently makes the tasks lose performances. A possible way to overstep that problem is to model the <b>microgripper</b> behavior and its dependency with the environment as perfect as possible and then calculate a controller from this. However, such model is complex to handle and the yielded controllers are often very complex for implementation. In this paper, we propose to use interval models to describe the behavior of the piezoelectric actuators that compose the <b>microgripper.</b> Then a controllers synthesis consisting in combining interval techniques and classical control theory is proposed. Both the position and the force raised in the <b>microgripper</b> are considered. The main advantages of the proposed technique are: 1) ease and natural way to model the uncertainties, 2) the robustness of the synthesized controllers, 3) and the derivation of low order controllers that are easier for implementation relative to those of classical robust control techniques.
