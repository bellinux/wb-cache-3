30|$|Discrete choice model acts {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tools for studies involving <b>mode</b> <b>split</b> in the context of transport demand forecast. As different types of discrete choice models display their merits and restrictions diversely, how to properly select the specific type among discrete choice models for realistic application still remains to be a tough problem. In this article, five typical discrete choice models for transport <b>mode</b> <b>split</b> are, respectively, discussed, which includes multinomial logit model, nested logit model (NL), heteroscedastic extreme value model, multinominal probit model and mixed multinomial logit model (MMNL). The theoretical basis and application attributes of these five models are especially analysed with great attention, and they are also applied to a realistic intercity case of <b>mode</b> <b>split</b> forecast, which results indicating that NL model does well in accommodating similarity and heterogeneity across alternatives, while MMNL model serves as the most effective method for mode choice prediction since it shows the highest reliability with the least significant prediction errors and even outperforms the other four models in solving the heterogeneity and similarity problems. This study indicates that conclusions derived from a single discrete choice model are not reliable, and it is better to choose the proper model based on its characteristics.|$|E

Large mode splittings begin to overlap with the mode splittings {{produced by}} different radial and latitudinal modes at relatively low rotation rates.

In particular the papers seeks to establish whether increased border security has led to increases in border wait times and whether border wait times have been affected differentially for trucks and trains providing competitive advantage to rail as a mode to move freight along this corridor. While {{it was not possible to}} compare actual border wait times before and after September 11 th because of the fact that border wait time information was only collected after September 11 th, it does not seem that {{there has been}} an appreciable increase in border wait time along this corridor and in particular not enough to provide an increased advantage to rail. As well, there is little support for the hypothesis that rail <b>mode</b> <b>split</b> was positively affected in the post 9 / 11 period.

40|$|As the world’s largest {{developing}} country, China {{currently is}} undergoing rapid urbanization and motorization, which {{will result in}} far-reaching impacts on energy and the environment. According to estimates, energy use and carbon emissions in the transportation sector will comprise roughly 30 % of total emissions by 2030. Since the late 1990 s, transportation-related issues such as energy, consumption, and carbon emissions have become a policy focus in China. To date, most research and policies have centered on vehicle technologies that promote vehicle efficiency and reduced emissions. Limited research exists on the control of greenhouse gases through mode shifts in urban transportation—in particular, through the promotion of public transit. The {{purpose of this study}} is to establish a methodology to analyze carbon emissions from the urban transportation sector at the Chinese city level. By using Jinan, the capital of China’s Shandong Province, as an example, we have developed an analytical model to simulate energy consumption and carbon emissions based on the number of trips, the transportation <b>mode</b> <b>split,</b> and the trip distance. This model has enabled us to assess the impacts of the transportation <b>mode</b> <b>split</b> on energy consumption and carbon emissions. Furthermore, this paper reviews a set of methods for data collection, estimation, and processing for situations where statistical data are scarce in China. This paper also describes the simulation of three transportation system development scenarios.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Washington State {{passed the}} first version of the Commute Trip Reduction (CTR) Law in 1991 and the {{resulting}} CTR program has been run by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). The primary goal of the program was to reduce congestion by promoting the use of alternative commuting modes to SOV. That intention has remained the same today, although much of the implementation has shifted from the state to city level. Rather than setting state-wide goals for all work sites, WSDOT now primarily serves as an advisor to local jurisdictions in charge of creating their own CTR plans. Existing data shows a concentration of sites in downtown Seattle meeting their state-wide CTR goals while work sites in suburban jurisdictions struggle to meet the same goal. The purpose of this research is to determine the primary contributors to a site’s ability to reduce SOV <b>mode</b> <b>split</b> and meet its CTR goal—including the effect of transit accessibility. Specifically, this research attempts to answer two questions: 1) Do the factors for which WSDOT currently collects data significantly contribute to a site’s success to reduce its SOV <b>mode</b> <b>split</b> and meet its CTR goal? and 2) How can transit accessibility be factored into these CTR goals? A transit accessibility indicator was developed by summing the number of transit stops within a quarter-mile radial buffer of a work site. WSDOT’s 2015 / 2016 employee CTR survey data as well as King County Metro transit data were used as the basis for this research. Each site’s transit accessibility score was compared to its SOV <b>mode</b> <b>split,</b> and an exponential regression resulted in an R-squared value of 0. 71 for a sample of 294 CTR work sites. The transit accessibility indicator, along with other variables identified in WSDOT’s employee CTR survey, were then incorporated into logit and multivariable regression models that explain, respectively, whether a site has achieved an 18 % reduction in calculated VMT set by WSDOT in 2007 / 2008, and its SOV mode share. The results of the analysis show the transit accessibility indicator having a significant association with both a work site’s ability to meet its VMT goal and its SOV <b>mode</b> <b>split.</b> Preliminary discussions with WSDOT indicate the analysis will inform future policymaking as wells as be useful for TDM plan evaluation and department resource allocation. The analysis may also alleviate some concerns from suburban jurisdictions and employers who feel that alternative modes to SOV are not as widely available in areas with lower population and employment densities compared to central business districts. This research demonstrates that an “expected” SOV percentage can be identified for each work site depending on the level of transit accessibility, which could then be used as a benchmark for evaluation within the CTR program...|$|E
