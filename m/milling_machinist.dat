50|$|Brawn {{was born}} in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, England. He became {{interested}} in engineering during his early years, often visiting Belle Vue Stadium to watch various forms of motor racing. He moved south aged 11 as his father took a job near Reading, Berkshire and he subsequently attended Reading School in the town.In 1971 he was taken on as a mechanical craft apprentice by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority at its Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell, Oxfordshire, where he qualified as an instrument mechanic. He went on to start an HNC in Mechanical Engineering, still funded by Harwell. Living in Reading he found an advertisement for Frank Williams Grand Prix, which were based in Reading at that time, he was interviewed by Patrick Head. Williams {{were looking for a}} <b>milling</b> <b>machinist</b> {{which was one of the}} skills he learnt at Harwell.|$|E
5000|$|After {{graduating from}} Barrington High School, Blount {{attended}} Wentworth Institute of Technology, where he obtained an associate degree (at the time, {{the highest degree}} offered at Wentworth) in 1937. He got his entrepreneurial start by carving duck jewelry pins that he sold out of his [...] "Dippy Duck Widdle Shop". During those years Blount continued to design jewellery, worked for his grandfather's oyster company, and was also a <b>mill</b> <b>machinist</b> and plant engineer.|$|R
50|$|A {{milling machine}} {{is often called}} a <b>mill</b> by <b>machinists.</b> The archaic term miller was {{commonly}} used in the 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R
5000|$|In 1979 Batalov {{was invited}} to play Gosha, a <b>mill</b> <b>machinist,</b> in the melodrama Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears. After many hesitations, Batalov brilliantly played his part in the movie, which won him the USSR State Prize. The role was central to the film's Soviet message. As one {{character}} says in the picnic scene: [...] "Seventy percent of my doctorate was due to Gosha's mechanical genius". After that, he effectively retired from acting and devoted his time to coaching new generations of film actors. Boris Yeltsin presented the Lifetime Achievement Nika Award to him in 2002. Batalov was awarded the State Prize of the Russian Federation (2005).|$|R
50|$|Similarly, Connecticut {{industry}} became {{well known}} in allied fields. Hardware and tools continue to be manufactured by Stanley Corporation in New Britain, despite having almost moved elsewhere for financial reasons. Connecticut was a major area for development and manufacture of machine tools. In 1818, Simeon North designed America's first <b>milling</b> machine. <b>Machinist</b> Elisha Root first designed machinery for the Collins Company of Collinsville which manufactured axes which became world-famous, then was hired by Colt in 1849 to modernize firearm production by designing precision drop hammers, boring machines, gauges, jigs, etc., and improving the milling machines designed by Francis A. Pratt for the George S. Lincoln company in Hartford; the resulting Lincoln miller became world-famous, selling over 150,000 machines. Another Colt engineer, William Mason, patented 125 inventions for manufacture of firearms, as well as steam pumps and power looms. Christopher Spencer invented the automatic turret lathe (which in its small- to medium-sized form {{is known as a}} screw machine) for machining screws, as well as the variable cam cylinder used to control the turret. Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney invented a thread milling machine in 1865; Whitney also perfected various measurement instruments, and Pratt designed the aforementioned original milling machine manufactured by the George S. Lincoln company of Hartford. Simon Fairman invented the lathe chuck in West Stafford in 1830, and his son-in-law, Austin F. Cushman, invented the self-centering Cushman Universal Chuck in 1862. Edward P. Bullard designed the vertical boring mill in 1883. Charles E. Billings perfected the drop hammer for metal forging in the 1870s and designed the copper commutator central to the operation of electrical generators and motors. Edwin R. Fellows of Torrington in 1896 designed and built a new type of gear shaper and founded the Fellows Gear Shaper Company, which made a vital contribution to the manufacture of effective and reliable gear transmissions for the nascent automotive industry. The name Bridgeport on machine tools continues to be a guarantee of high quality around the world, for people who have no idea that the machinery is named after a city in Connecticut. Even the world of toys was dominated by the A. C. Gilbert Company, manufacturers of Erector Sets as well as other educational toys such as chemistry sets, microscopes, toy trains, etc.|$|R
