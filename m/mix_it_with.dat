5|$|The ink sac of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} sac produces the ink, and the sac stores it. The sac is {{close enough to the}} funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before it leaves the funnel, the ink passes through glands which <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack the ink sac.|$|E

25|$|Plants {{designed}} for lignite (brown coal) are increasingly used in locations {{as varied as}} Germany, Victoria, Australia and North Dakota. Lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal. It has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output. Such coals may contain up to 70% water and ash, yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans. The firing systems also differ from black coal and typically draw hot gas from the furnace-exit level and <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the incoming coal in fan-type mills that inject the pulverized coal and hot gas mixture into the boiler.|$|E
25|$|Mach3 {{performance}} in the 1950s was difficult to achieve. Jet engines compress incoming air, then <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> fuel and ignite the mixture. The resulting expansion of gases produces thrust. The compressors generally can ingest air only at subsonic speeds. To operate supersonically, aircraft use advanced intakes to slow the supersonic air to a usable speed. The energy lost in this process heats the air, which means the engine has to operate at ever-higher temperatures to provide net thrust. The limiting factor in this process is {{the temperature of the}} materials in the engines, in particular, the turbine blades just behind the combustion chambers. Using materials available at the time, speeds much beyond Mach2.5 were difficult to achieve.|$|E

Songs in A Minor debuted at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 chart, selling over 236,000 copies in its first week. It has sold over 6.2 million copies in the United States and 16 million copies worldwide. Rolling Stone magazine named Songs in A Minor the second best album of 2001, while ranking it number 95 on its list of the best albums of the 2000s decade. In 2013 Entertainment Weekly ranked the album at the 57th position among the greatest albums of all time.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion of}} honor is another social {{characteristic}} Holý identifies as being related to Middle Eastern cousin marriage. The {{honor of the}} males surrounding a woman is sullied in many societies when she misbehaves or when she is attacked. In societies like Europe that place greater value on affinal relations, responsibility for a married woman rests with both her husband's family and her own. In the Middle East the situation is different in that primary responsibility continues to rest with the woman's own family even after she is married. Her agnates therefore cannot release her from control upon marriage due to the risk to their honor. They and not the husband {{may be responsible for}} killing her, or sometimes her lover, if she commits adultery. Similar rules may apply in case of the payment if she is killed and for the inheritance of her property if she has no male heirs. Her natal family may continue supporting her even against her husband. This is an idealized system: some Middle Eastern societies do <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> other systems that assign more responsibility to the husband's family.|$|E

500|$|Many basic {{variations}} of cooking utensils available today, such as frying pans, pots, kettles, and waffle irons, already existed, {{although they were}} often too expensive for poorer households. Other tools more specific to cooking over an open fire were spits of various sizes, and material for skewering anything from delicate quails to whole oxen. There were also cranes with adjustable hooks so that pots and cauldrons could easily be swung away from the fire {{to keep them from}} burning or boiling over. Utensils were often held directly over the fire or placed into embers on tripods. To assist the cook there were also assorted knives, stirring spoons, ladles and graters. In wealthy households {{one of the most common}} tools was the mortar and sieve cloth, since many medieval recipes called for food to be finely chopped, mashed, strained and seasoned either before or after cooking. This was based on a belief among physicians that the finer the consistency of food, the more effectively the body would absorb the nourishment. It also gave skilled cooks the opportunity to elaborately shape the results. Fine-textured food was also associated with wealth; for example, finely milled flour was expensive, while the bread of commoners was typically brown and coarse. A typical procedure was farcing (from the Latin farcio, [...] "to cram"), to skin and dress an animal, grind up the meat and <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> spices and other ingredients and then return it into its own skin, or mold it into the shape of a completely different animal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{slaughtering}} process {{changed over}} time. An {{analysis of the}} deep piles of bone at the site revealed that the earliest hunters probably just stripped the hides and meat off the dead animals. But around 500 CE, Native Americans began using fire pits to cook or dry the meat, then pulverize it and <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> dried berries and fat to create pemmican. Tribespeople also built shallow bowls in the earth and lined them with rock to create primitive cooking pots. These cooking devices (known as [...] "blood kettles") were used to boil bison blood {{so that it would}} coagulate and to lessen its susceptibility to spoilage. Other foods would be mixed with the coagulated blood to form a sort of gelatinous food source high in protein and nutrients, or the cooked blood could be used with ground grain to make biscuits.|$|E
