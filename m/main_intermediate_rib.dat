5000|$|In some English work, {{as may be}} seen in fig. 9, {{each course}} of stone was of uniform height {{from one side to the}} other; but, as the {{diagonal}} rib was longer than either the transverse or wall rib, the courses dipped towards the former, and at the apex of the vault were cut to fit one another. At an early period, in consequence of the great span of the vault and the very slight rise or curvature of the web, it was thought better to simplify the construction of the web by introducing <b>intermediate</b> <b>ribs</b> between the wall rib and the diagonal rib and between the diagonal and the transverse ribs; and in order to meet the thrust of these <b>intermediate</b> <b>ribs</b> a ridge rib was required, and the prolongation of this rib to the wall rib hid the junction of the web at the summit, which was not always very sightly, and constituted the ridge rib. In France, on the other hand, the web courses were always laid horizontally, and they are therefore of unequal height, increasing towards the diagonal rib. Each course also was given a slight rise in the centre, so as to increase its strength; this enabled the French masons to dispense with the <b>intermediate</b> <b>rib,</b> which was not introduced by them until the 15th century, and then more as a decorative than a constructive feature, as the domical form given to the French web rendered unnecessary the ridge rib, which, with some few exceptions, exists only in England.|$|R

5000|$|This {{resulted}} {{in what is}} known as a sexpartite, or six-celled vault, of which one of the earliest examples is found in the Abbaye-aux-Hommes (S. Etienne) at Caen. This church, built by William the Conqueror, was originally constructed to carry a timber roof only, but nearly a century later {{the upper part of the}} nave walls were partly rebuilt, in order that it might be covered with a vault. The immense size, however, of the square vault over the nave necessitated some additional support, so that an <b>intermediate</b> <b>rib</b> was thrown across the church, dividing the square compartment into six cells, and called the sexpartite vault; this was adopted in the cathedrals of Sens (1170), Laon (1195), Noyon (1190), Paris (1223-35), and Bourges (1250).|$|R

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples of {{the introduction of the}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>rib</b> is found in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, and there the ridge rib is not carried to the wall rib. It was soon found, however, that the construction of the web was much facilitated by additional ribs, and consequently there was a tendency to increase their number, so that in the nave of Exeter Cathedral three <b>intermediate</b> <b>ribs</b> were provided between the wall rib and the diagonal rib. In order to mask the junction of the various ribs, their intersections were ornamented with richly carved bosses, and this practice increased on the introduction of another short rib, known as the lierne, a term in France given to the ridge rib. Lierne ribs are short ribs crossing between the main ribs, and were employed chiefly as decorative features, as, for instance, in the Liebfrauenkirche (1482) of Mühlacker, Germany. One of the best examples of Lierne ribs exists in the vault of the oriel window of Crosby Hall, London. The tendency {{to increase the number of}} ribs led to singular results in some cases, as in the choir of Gloucester Cathedral, where the ordinary diagonal ribs become mere ornamental mouldings on the surface of an intersected pointed barrel vault, and again in the cloisters, where the introduction of the fan vault, forming a concave-sided conoid, returned to the principles of the Roman geometrical vault. This is further shown in the construction of these fan vaults, for although in {{the earliest}} examples each of the ribs above the tas-de-charge was an independent feature, eventually it was found easier to carve them and the web out of the solid stone, so that the rib and web were purely decorative and had no constructional or independent functions.|$|R

50|$|The <b>intermediate</b> <b>rib,</b> however, had the {{disadvantage}} of partially obscuring {{one side of the}} clerestory windows, and it threw unequal weights on the alternate piers, so that in the cathedral of Soissons (1205) a quadripartite (fig. 8) or four-celled vault was introduced, the width of each bay being half the span of the nave, and corresponding therefore with the aisle piers. To this there are some exceptions, in Sant' Ambrogio, Milan, and San Michele, Pavia (the original vault), and in the cathedrals of Spires, Mainz and Worms, where the quadripartite vaults are nearly square, the intermediate piers of the aisles being of much smaller dimensions. In England sexpartite vaults exist at Canterbury (1175) (set out by William of Sens), Rochester (1200), Lincoln (1215), Durham (east transept), and St. Faith's chapel, Westminster Abbey.|$|R

25|$|In {{the earlier}} stage of rib vaulting, the arched ribs {{consisted}} of independent or separate voussoirs {{down to the}} springing; the difficulty, however, of working the ribs separately led to two other important changes: (1) {{the lower part of}} the transverse diagonal and wall ribs were all worked out of one stone; and (2) the lower horizontal, constituting what is known as the tas-de-charge or solid springer. The tas-de-charge, or solid springer, had two advantages: (1) it enabled the stone courses to run straight through the wall, so as to bond the whole together much better; and (2) it lessened the span of the vault, which then required a centering of smaller dimensions. As soon as the ribs were completed, the web or stone shell of the vault was laid on them. In some English work each course of stone was of uniform height from one side to the other; but, as the diagonal rib was longer than either the transverse or wall rib, the courses dipped towards the former, and at the apex of the vault were cut to fit one another. In the early English Gothic period, in consequence of the great span of the vault and the very slight rise or curvature of the web, it was thought better to simplify the construction of the web by introducing <b>intermediate</b> <b>ribs</b> between the wall rib and the diagonal rib and between the diagonal and the transverse ribs; and in order to meet the thrust of these <b>intermediate</b> <b>ribs</b> a ridge rib was required, and the prolongation of this rib to the wall rib hid the junction of the web at the summit, which was not always very sightly, and constituted the ridge rib.

In both English and French vaulting centering was rarely required for the building of the web, a template (Fr. cerce) being employed to support the stones of each ring until it was complete. In Italy, Germany and Spain the French method of building the web was adopted, with horizontal courses and a domical form. Sometimes, in the case of comparatively narrow compartments, and more especially in clerestories, the wall rib was stilted, and this caused a peculiar twisting of the web, where the springing of the wall rib is at K: to these twisted surfaces the term ploughshare vaulting is given.|$|R

The experimental {{results showed that}} the overall kinetic constant (k) of MBT degradation using Nd 3 +-TiO 2 was significantly higher than that using TiO 2 and an optimal content of neodymium ion doping was found to be 1. 2 % (molar ratio). The <b>main</b> <b>intermediates</b> during the MBT degradation were identified by LC/MS-MS, and the final products including sulfate ion, ammonium ion, and nitrate ion were also determined by ion chromatography. Only three <b>main</b> <b>intermediates</b> including benzothiazolë, 2 -hydroxybenzothiazole, and benzothiazole- 2 -sulfite were found during the MBT degradation using the TiO 2 catalyst, while five <b>main</b> <b>intermediates</b> including benzothiazole, 2 -hydroxybenzothiazole, benzothiazole- 2 -sulfonate, benzothiazole- 2 -sulfite, and anilinesulfonic acid were found during the MBT degradation using 1. 2 % Nd 3 +-TiO 2. On the basis of analytical results, a possible pathway of MBT degradation in such a photocatalytic oxidation reaction was proposed and illustrated.
