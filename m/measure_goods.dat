5000|$|A problem domain is {{the area}} of {{expertise}} or application {{that needs to be}} examined to solve a problem. A problem domain is simply looking at only the topics of an individual's interest, and excluding everything else. For example, when developing a system to <b>measure</b> <b>good</b> practice in medicine, carpet drawings at hospitals would not be included in the problem domain. In this example, the domain refers to relevant topics solely within the delimited area of interest: medicine.|$|R

With this technique both the Kerr and the electrostrictive contributions to the intensity dependence of the nonlinear refractive index in a step-index fiber were <b>measured.</b> <b>Good</b> agreement between calculated and measured values was observed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a type of}} two-pole microstrip bandpass filter with one reconfigurable transmission zero. The couplings between the resonators and the non-resonant nodes are used to generate the transmission zero. The desired tunability of the transmission zero is realized by changing the center frequencies of the two resonators. In the practical designs, varactors are employed to shift the center frequencies of the resonant node. To verify the working principles, filters implementing the proposed topology are fabricated and <b>measured.</b> <b>Good</b> results have been obtained. © 2006 EuMA...|$|R
