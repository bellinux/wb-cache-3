40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{describe}} a new technique for the mandibular first molar extraction based on tooth section in rats. One hundred and forty Wistar rats, from three different researches underwent general anaesthesia. Each animal was then positioned on a specific board and hollemback 3 ss was used to make the syndesmotomy. The mandibular first molars were extracted after tooth section with carbide 1 / 4 drills in a high-speed hand piece under constant irrigation with sterile saline solution, The mesial portion of the first molar was removed with a modified curved <b>mosquito</b> <b>forceps.</b> The distal portion was removed and the socket was closed with 5 - 0 nylon thread sutures using non-traumatic needles. During the first week after tooth extraction animals were fed with regular pressed food to avoid post-operatory trauma. This technique is careful and avoid unnecessary trauma, with minimal numbers of fractures (9. 3 %) and accidents such as haemorrhage (2 %) All the reminiscent roots could be removed by the described method. Our technique proved to be an efficient model for future researches on alveolar wound healing with minimal fractures and accidents and provided better post-extraction outcomes for the rats...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Glottic leakage during {{phonation}} is {{a direct}} consequence of unilateral vocal fold (VF) paralysis. This air leakage can be in the horizontal plane and in the vertical plane. Presently, there is no easily applicable medical device allowing noninvasive, office-based measurement of the relative vertical position of the VFs. The larynx ruler (LR) is a laser-based measuring device that could meet the previously stated need, using a flexible endoscope. This study represents a proof of concept regarding the use of the LR in assessing VF relative positions in the vertical plane. Materials and methods: One fresh male human cadaver larynx, free of neurologic and anatomic disease, was explored with the LR system through the operative channel of a flexible gastroenterology video-endoscope. The tip of the video-endoscope was located in the laryngeal vestibule. The right crico-arytenoid joint was posteriorly disarticulated. Tilting of the VF was obtained by pulling or pushing the arytenoid cartilage with a <b>mosquito</b> <b>forceps</b> fixed to the stump of the previously sectioned superior tip of the posterior crico-arytenoid muscle allowing anterior and posterior tilting of the arytenoid cartilage in order to induce an elevation or a depression of the VF process. Ten “push” and ten “pull” sessions were performed. The distance from the tip of the video-endoscope to each illuminated pixel of the laser beam was recorded. The level difference between the left and right VFs was measured for each recording. Results: Data provided by the LR were consistently in accordance with the movements applied on the VFs. The accuracy of 0. 2 mm of the LR is compatible with the envisioned applications for the human larynx. Conclusion: The LR system represents a feasible technique to evaluate respective vertical position of VFs in the human larynx. Technical limitations were identified that will require improvements before experimental use on human beings. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess clinico-radiological {{findings}} of urinary diversion, five adult healthy mongrel dogs of both sexes weighing between 25 - 40 kg and average age of 1. 5 years, underwent continent urinary diversion surgery. In this approach fifteen centimeters of the descending colon with preservation of its mesenteric vessels was resected and this segment longitudinally was opened and flushed with an aqueous solution of povidin iodine 0. 1 % and the remaining colon re-anastomosed by seromuscular sutures. Then two ends of transected ureters were drawn into the resected colon by <b>mosquito</b> hemostatic <b>forceps</b> and simple interrupted sutures were placed between the ureter and the colonic mucosa for uretero-colonic anastomosis. The uretero-colonic part in a cap form transplanted to partially cystectomized bladder with one layer of cushing pattern suture. All animals survived after the operation. Clinically, all dogs were dull and depressed and passed blood tinged urine for first few postoperative days. There was pollakiuria in all of animals distinctly, but urinary incontinence was not observed. At the first few postoperative days, anorexia, nausea and vomiting were seen in three dogs. In all animals, polydipsia were seen and continued {{until the end of}} study. Intravenous urograms showed hydronephrosis and upper urinary tracts dilatation in all animals at 25 th day but there were signs of improvement at 45 th day distinctly. Unilateral ureteral obstruction was observed in two dogs. In regards to clinico-radiological findings can be concluded that this operation has some distinct sequela that some of them may be seen in radiographic assessments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the effect of}} injection speed on epidural pressure (EP), injection pressure (IP), epidural distribution (ED) of solution, and extent of sensory blockade (SB) during lumbosacral epidural anesthesia in dogs. Study designProspective experimental trial. AnimalsTen healthy adult Beagle dogs weighing 8. 7 ± 1. 6 kg. MethodsGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol administered intravenously and maintained with isoflurane. Keeping the dogs in sternal recumbency, two spinal needles connected to electrical pressure transducers were inserted into the L 6 -L 7 and the L 7 -S 1 intervertebral epidural spaces for EP and IP measurements, respectively. Bupivacaine 0. 5 % diluted in iohexol was administered epidurally to each dog via spinal needle at L 7 -S 1 intervertebral space, at two rates of injection (1 and 2 mL minute− 1 groups), with a 1 -week washout period. Epidural distribution was verified with computed tomography, and SB was evaluated after arousal by pinching the skin with a <b>mosquito</b> hemostatic <b>forceps</b> over the vertebral dermatomes. The results were analyzed according to each injection speed, using paired t- and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. ResultsMean ± SD of baseline EP and IP values were 2. 1 ± 6. 1 and 2. 6 ± 7. 1 mmHg, respectively. Significant differences were observed between 1 and 2 mL minute− 1 groups for peak EP (23. 1 ± 8. 5 and 35. 0 ± 14. 5 mmHg, p = 0. 047) and peak IP (68. 5 ± 10. 7 and 144. 7 ± 32. 6 mmHg, p < 0. 001). However, the median (range) of the ED, 11. 5 (4 – 22) and 12 (5 – 21) vertebrae, and SB, 3. 5 (0 – 20) and 1 (0 – 20) dermatomes, values of the two groups were not related to injection speed. Conclusions and clinical relevanceThe EP profile during injection was measured by separating the injection and pressure monitoring lines. The increase in epidural injection speed increased the EP, but not the ED or the SB in dogs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A {{fracture}} of root canal instruments, with a fractured piece protruding beyond the apex, is a troublesome incident during an endodontic treatment. Locating and retrieving them represents {{a challenge to}} maxillofacial surgeons because {{it is difficult to}} access due to the proximity between the foreign body and vital structures. Although safe and accurate for surgery, radiographs and electromagnetic devices do not provide a precise three-dimensional position. In contrast, computer-aided navigation provides a correlation between preoperatively collected data and intraoperatively encountered anatomy. However, using a navigation system for mandible treatment is difficult as the mobile nature of the mandible complicates its synchronization with the preoperative imaging data during surgery. Case presentation This report describes a case of a dental instrument breakage in the mandible during an endodontic treatment for a restorative dental procedure in a 65 -year-old Japanese woman. The broken dental instrument was removed using a minimally invasive approach with a surgical navigation system and an interocclusal splint for a stable, identically repeatable positioning of the mandible. Using the three-dimensional position of the navigation probe, a location that best approximated the most anterior extent of the fragment was selected. A minimally invasive vestibular incision was made at this location, a subperiosteal reflection was performed, and the foreign body location was confirmed using a careful navigation system. The instrument was carefully visualized and extruded from the apical to the tooth crown side and was then removed using <b>mosquito</b> <b>forceps</b> through the medullary cavity of the crown side of the tooth. Follow-up was uneventful; her clinical course was good. Conclusions The use of a surgical navigation system together with an interocclusal splint enabled the retrieval of a broken dental instrument in a safe and minimally invasive manner without damaging the surrounding vital structures...|$|E
