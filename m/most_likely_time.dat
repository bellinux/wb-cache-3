5|$|Matings are {{generally}} observed between March and May, but the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>time</b> of conception is April. Most mating {{takes place in}} the territories and during the day. Females have control over the copulation process, and males may have to keep mating with the same females. Females usually give birth to one young each year. Gestation lasts around 27 weeks, and pregnant females give birth between late September and November. Late births into January are sometimes observed. The altricial newborns rely on their mothers for warmth. For their first three weeks, young cling to their mothers when they go foraging. After this, the young remain in the roosts. By January, young are capable of sustained flight, and by February, March or April are fully weaned.|$|E
25|$|Hurricane season officially {{runs from}} June 1 through November 30, {{although}} hurricanes can develop beyond those dates. The <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>time</b> for Miami {{to be hit}} is during {{the peak of the}} Cape Verde season, which is mid-August through the end of September. Although tornadoes are uncommon in the area, one struck in 1925 and again in 1997. Around 40% of homes in Miami are built upon floodplains and are considered as flood-risk zones.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} a holidaymaker reported seeing four people apparently stranded on Diamond Rock, a semi-submerged reef off Porthluney Cove, west of Dodman Point. The police were informed, {{but at that time}} Darlwyne was not overdue, and thus {{there was no reason to}} connect these people with those on the boat. This incident was not referred to in the subsequent searches, nor in the later Board of Trade enquiry which fixed the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>time</b> of sinking several hours later.|$|E

50|$|The Sand Ridge Site {{lies about}} 0.3 mi {{away from the}} Clough Creek Site. Located along a {{prominent}} ridgeline {{to the west of}} the old Union Bridge along the road between Cincinnati and Batavia, it has long been known as a significant archaeological site. As early as the 1880s, many individuals frequently visited the ridge to collect artifacts from the surface, such as bones, pottery, and pieces of flint. The residents appear to have inhabited the site only seasonally, with autumn and winter being the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>times</b> of occupation. They appear to have been heavily dependent on fish for their food, as many fish bones have been discovered at Sand Ridge; among the most common types of fish were suckers, channel catfish, and freshwater drums.|$|R
25|$|Delray Beach has hot {{and humid}} summers and warm winters, with a marked drier season in the winter. Its near sea-level elevation, coastal location, {{position}} just above the Tropic of Cancer, and proximity to the Gulf Stream shapes its climate. Hurricane season officially runs from June 1 through November 30, although hurricanes can develop outside those dates. The <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>time</b> for hurricane activity is during {{the peak of the}} Cape Verde season, which is mid-August through the end of September. Delray Beach has received direct or near direct hits from hurricanes in 1903, 1906, 1928, 1947, 1949, 1964, 1965, 1979, 1992, 1999, 2004, and 2005.|$|E
25|$|Hurricane season officially {{runs from}} June 1 through November 30, {{although}} hurricanes can develop outside that period. The <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>time</b> for South Florida {{to be hit}} is during {{the peak of the}} Cape Verde season, mid-August through the end of September. Due to its location between two major bodies of water known for tropical activity, South Florida is also statistically the most likely major area to be struck by a hurricane in the world, trailed closely by Nassau, Bahamas, and Havana, Cuba. Many hurricanes have affected the metropolis, including Betsy in 1965, Andrew in 1992, Irene in 1999, Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma in 2005, and Irma in 2017. In addition, a tropical depression in October 2000 passed over the city, causing record rainfall and flooding. Locally, the storm is credited as the No Name Storm of 2000, though the depression went on to become Tropical Storm Leslie upon entering the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Haig {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the War Cabinet (7 January). He claimed to have recommended that the British should keep the initiative and draw in German reserves (to prevent a German attack on the French) by renewing the offensive around Ypres, and that this proposal did not meet with political approval. In fact the logistical infrastructure was not available for a breakout from the Ypres salient, and {{there is no mention of}} his suggestion in the official minutes. The minutes do agree with Haig's account that he warned only of limited German offensives. After the meeting Robertson, who had also been present and who had been concerned that Haig had not got his point across, insisted that Haig submit a paper warning of the danger of a major German offensive. Over lunch (9 January) at 10 Downing Street with Lord Derby (Secretary of State for War) and Lloyd George (Derby bet a skeptical Lloyd George 100 cigars to 100 cigarettes that the war would be over by the following year), Haig predicted that the war would end within a year because of the “internal state of Germany” (a broadly accurate prediction). Charteris’ final intelligence report had deduced that Germany was bringing 32 divisions, ten per month, from the moribund Eastern Front, so the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>time</b> for a German Offensive was in late March (again, a correct prediction). Bonar Law (Chancellor of the Exchequer and Conservative Leader) asked Haig what he would do if he were a German general: Haig replied that any German attempt to “break through” would be a “gambler’s throw” as Germany had only a million men as reserves and the balance of manpower would shift in favour of the Allies in August (i.e. when more US troops had arrived - in fact this would happen a month or two earlier as US deployment was speeded up after the German Spring Offensives) and that if he were a German general he would launch only limited offensives, although he did warn that the German generals might try to keep the civilians out of power by launching an attack to knock out France. Haig again left the politicians with the impression that he thought the Germans would launch small attacks on the scale of Cambrai.|$|E

2500|$|The Pilgrims celebrated at Plymouth {{for three}} days after their first harvest in 1621.

[...] Seventeenth-century accounts do not identify this as a thanksgiving observance, rather it followed the harvest. It included 50 persons {{who were on the}} Mayflower (all who remained of the 100 who had landed) and 90 Native Americans.

2500|$|The most {{significant}} challenge facing Whitchurch–Stouffville {{in the coming}} years, however, is the federal government's proposed development of an international airport immediately south-east of Whitchurch–Stouffville (the Pickering Airport lands).

2500|$|Still, the Dorians did {{share in}} the Geometric period and {{therefore}} to find its origin might be perhaps to find {{the origin of the}} Dorians. The Geometric originated by clear transition from the Proto-geometric. The logical break in material culture is the start of the Proto-geometric at about 1050 BC, which leaves a gap of 150 years. The year 1050 offers nothing distinctively Dorian either, but if the Dorians were present in the Geometric, and they were not always in place as an unrecorded lower class, 1050 is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>time</b> of entry. Cartledge says humorously:"It has of late become an acknowledged scandal that the Dorians, archaeologically speaking, do not exist. That is, there is no cultural trait surviving in the material record for the two centuries or so after 1200 which can be regarded as a peculiarly Dorian hallmark. Robbed of their patents for Geometric pottery, cremation burial, iron-working and, the unkindest prick of all, the humble straight pin, the hapless Dorians stand naked before their creator – or, some would say, inventor." ...|$|E
