5|$|According to the manufacturer, the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the tungsten carbide bearing ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium platter, <b>mat</b> and decoupler blobs. The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. The bearing is of a higher quality; the platter and sub-platter have been redesigned. A <b>mat</b> with distinctive cut-outs {{is placed on the}} platter assembly to support the disc. While the top board sits on decoupling blobs, the lower half has bright polished-metal feet. The bearing ball, Blobs and <b>mat</b> are available to existing owners for retrofitting their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|E

Close to the end, Davidlifted up and slammed Siaki back-first into the <b>mat</b> with a Spinebuster. The referee refused to count the pin, deeming that David was not the {{eligible}} man. This allowed Apolo to lift up and slam David face-first into the <b>mat</b> to win the match.|$|E
5000|$|Modular <b>mats,</b> {{also well}} known as {{interlocking}} tiles or interlocking floor <b>mats,</b> are manufactured using the “jigsaw puzzle” structure. Unlike one-piece <b>mats,</b> modular <b>mats</b> consist of numerous elements that are easily and seamlessly assembled. Compared to other types of <b>mats,</b> interlocking <b>mats</b> come in several sizes, depending {{on the number of}} pieces in one kit. Modular <b>mats</b> are a good solution for non-rectangular areas where standard shape <b>mats</b> are useless. Interlocking <b>mats</b> are commonly used on a one-time or temporary basis: fitness centres and sport competitions, trade shows and conferences. Modular <b>mats</b> require less place for storage and can be easily transported.|$|R

50|$|Reed <b>mats</b> are {{handmade}} <b>mats</b> of plaited reed, made {{throughout most}} of India and Thailand.The <b>mats</b> are produced by plaiting reeds, strips of palm leaf, or some other easily available local plant.

These <b>mats</b> are also now being made into shopping bags, place <b>mats,</b> and decorative wall hangings.|$|R
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.integrifolia has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a <b>mat</b> {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Studies on B.integrifolia suggest that its proteoid root <b>mat</b> achieves this by chemically modifying its soil environment.|$|E
5|$|More {{problems}} ensued during filming: Paul Le <b>Mat</b> {{was sent}} to the hospital after an allergic reaction to walnuts. Le <b>Mat,</b> Harrison Ford and Bo Hopkins were claimed to be drunk most nights and every weekend, and had conducted climbing competitions {{to the top of the}} local Holiday Inn sign. One actor set fire to Lucas's motel room. Another night, Le <b>Mat</b> threw Richard Dreyfuss into a swimming pool, gashing Dreyfuss' forehead on the day before he was due to have his close-ups filmed. Dreyfuss also complained over the wardrobe that Lucas had chosen for the character. Ford was kicked out of his motel room at the Holiday Inn. In addition, two camera operators were nearly killed when filming the climactic race scene on Frates Road outside Petaluma. Principal photography ended on August 4, 1972.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the tree}} grows thicker and taller as {{successive}} rings develop around its trunk and new buds grow on the branches. The tree {{becomes part of}} an old growth forest with a shaded and damp understory of broadleaf trees, shrubs, and ferns. In the canopy, a <b>mat</b> of dead needles and lichen accumulate on the wide upper branches. Exposed to light, air, and rain, the needles decompose and the <b>mat</b> becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila <b>mats</b> gene plays a {{critical}} role in growth control. Using molecular genetic approaches we investigated how <b>mats</b> is regulated in development. A 2236 -bp genomic sequence that contains entire <b>mats</b> including upstream and downstream intergenic regions can rescue <b>mats</b> mutant phenotypes, indicating that regulatory elements necessary for proper <b>mats</b> expression are mostly retained. However, constructs without the upstream or downstream intergenic region failed to rescue <b>mats</b> mutants, demonstrating the functional importance of these sequences. Moreover, <b>mats</b> expression is reduced in matse 17, a <b>mats</b> allele with over one-third of the downstream intergenic region deleted. Consistent with a model that the downstream intergenic region is critical for <b>mats</b> activity, this sequence contains evolutionarily conserved elements and has enhancer activities...|$|R

50|$|Carpet <b>mats</b> {{and rubber}} <b>mats</b> differ {{in a number}} of ways. Carpet <b>mats</b> are {{generally}} tufted and have a rubberised anti-slip backing. On the other hand, rubber car <b>mats</b> are heavy duty and higher durability. While some car <b>mats</b> are the plain colour of rubber, many contain branded company logos, cartoon characters or advertisements. Some are in textile form of carpet material. They can also come {{in a wide range of}} colours.

40|$|Purpose: In this imaging study, the radial {{displacement}} of meniscal allograft transplants (<b>MATs),</b> inserted with 2 different techniques, namely open soft-tissue fixation and arthroscopic bone tunnel fixation, was compared 1 year postoperatively. Methods: In this study, 37 patients received MATs: 16 <b>MATs</b> (10 lateral and 6 medial) were inserted by an open soft-tissue technique (open <b>MATs),</b> whereas 21 <b>MATs</b> (14 lateral and 7 medial) were implanted by an arthroscopic bone tunnel procedure (arthroscopic <b>MATs).</b> Radial displacement, in millimeters, was evaluated 1 year postoperatively on 1. 5 -T magnetic resonance images. The number of <b>MATs</b> with {{radial displacement}} larger or smaller than 3 mm was determined. To compare radial displacement of open versus arthroscopic <b>MATs,</b> the Mann-Whitney U test was used. Results: The radial displacement of open lateral and medial <b>MATs</b> was significantly larger (all reported P <. 02) {{than that of}} arthroscopic <b>MATs.</b> In all cases, both open and arthroscopic, the radial displacement of <b>MATs</b> was significantly larger (all reported P <. 007) than that of normal menisci. Radial displacement of less than 3 mm was found in 0 of 6 patients with open medial <b>MATs</b> versus 6 of 7 patients with arthroscopic <b>MATs</b> and was found in 1 of 10 patients with open lateral <b>MATs</b> versus 4 of 14 patients with arthroscopic <b>MATs.</b> Conclusions: The radial displacement of <b>MATs</b> arthroscopically inserted with bone tunnel fixation is significantly less than the radial displacement of <b>MATs</b> inserted with open soft-tissue fixation. In addition, normal menisci displace significantly less than meniscal allografts. The clinical importance of radial displacement remains to be determined.

50|$|The {{formation}} of floating <b>mats</b> {{is a process}} of sedimentation in water bodies. In bog ponds, floating <b>mats</b> of peat moss form as water levels fall and nutrients accumulate. In eutrophic waters, the {{formation of}} floating <b>mats</b> is caused by underwater peat that floats to the surface and is colonised by plants. The vegetative <b>mats</b> are held together by their root systems. Reeds or rushes growing by the lakeshore can eventually cut these <b>mats</b> off, which results in a floating island. If the floating <b>mats</b> are stable and large enough, even trees can grow on them, as at the Kleiner Arbersee. Beneath the floating <b>mats,</b> peat is formed, which slowly sinks downwards and gradually fills the water body.|$|R

After this, Cage removed the padding from one of the turnbuckles. Brown gained a two-count on Cage after slamming him against the <b>mat</b> with his signature Alpha Bomb maneuver and covered for the pin, but the referee had a delayed reaction.
