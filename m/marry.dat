5|$|Although {{the ideal}} ages for {{marriage}} were thirty {{for a man}} and twenty for a woman, it was common for a male to <b>marry</b> at age sixteen and a female at age fourteen. To encourage families to <b>marry</b> off their daughters, a law was introduced in 189 BCE that increased the poll tax rate fivefold for unmarried {{women between the ages}} of fifteen and thirty. People of the Han practiced a strict form of exogamy where one could not <b>marry</b> a person who had the same surname, even if both partners could not be traced back to a common ancestor (however, this excluded the royal family, who sometimes married distant relatives for political reasons). Officials often married into families with officials of equal status and sometimes married royal princesses or had their daughters <b>marry</b> kings and even the emperor.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 4,500 {{same-sex}} couples married in Spain {{during the first}} year of the law.

A ruling from the Justice Ministry stated that the country's same-sex marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to <b>marry</b> a non-Spaniard regardless of whether that person's homeland recognizes the partnership. At least one partner must be a Spanish citizen in order to <b>marry,</b> although two non-Spaniards may <b>marry</b> if they both have legal residence in Spain.|$|E
