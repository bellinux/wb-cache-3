A <b>merit</b> <b>good</b> may be described as a good that has positive externalities associated with it. Thus, an inoculation against a contagious disease may be seen as a <b>merit</b> <b>good.</b> This is because others who may not now catch the disease from the inoculated person also benefit.|$|R

40|$|Besley (1988) uses a scaling {{approach}} to model <b>merit</b> <b>good</b> arguments in commodity tax policy. In this paper, I question this approach {{on the grounds}} that it produces ’wrong’ recommendations—taxation (subsidisation) of merit (demerit) goods—whenever the demand for the (de) <b>merit</b> <b>good</b> is inelastic. I propose an alternative approach that does not suffer from this deficiency, and derive the ensuing first and second best tax rules, as well as the marginal cost expressions to perform tax reform analysis...|$|R
50|$|Government-owned {{corporations}} are common with natural monopolies and infrastructure, such as railways and telecommunications, strategic {{goods and services}} (mail, weapons), natural resources and energy, politically sensitive business, broadcasting, banking, demerit goods (e.g. alcoholic beverages), and <b>merit</b> <b>goods</b> (healthcare).|$|E
50|$|Group 2: it {{consists}} of services with strong externalities associated with them. In the case of these services, it is arguable {{that even though the}} exclusion may be possible, these ought to be treated as <b>merit</b> <b>goods</b> or near-public goods. The provision of subsidies is most justified in this case. Near zero recovery rates in these cases only indicate the societal judgement that these may be financed out of tax-revenues.|$|E
5000|$|Political {{factors are}} {{basically}} {{how the government}} intervenes in the economy. Specifically, political factors have areas including tax policy, labour law, environmental law, trade restrictions, tariffs, and political stability. Political factors may also include goods and services which the government aims to provide or be provided (<b>merit</b> <b>goods)</b> and those that {{the government does not}} want to be provided (demerit goods or merit bads). Furthermore, governments have a high impact on the health, education, and infrastructure of a nation.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>merit</b> <b>good</b> can {{be defined}} as a good which would be under-consumed (and under-produced) in the free market economy. This is due to two main reasons: ...|$|R

40|$|The individual's {{perception}} of transport cost usually {{does not include}} the full social cost of transport, as in for instance, its global environmental effects. Under this view, we observe a mismatch between individual perception and general social transport cost and welfare. In order to overcome this paradox, we need to induce a shift from the limited individualistic perspective to a more socio-economic view, whereby ethical judgments {{play a role in the}} economic decision-making process. Transport accessibility is here examined as a <b>merit</b> <b>good</b> and we therefore assume the necessity for government intervention in its provision. However, transport accessibility may be achieved through different levels of <b>merit</b> <b>good</b> values, as for instance, rail intervention versus road intervention. Some transport systems achieve greater fairness in accessibility, thus a higher <b>merit</b> <b>good</b> value; this implies that social planners need to discriminate various levels of subsidy and investment in relation to the fairness in transport accessibility...|$|R
5000|$|When consumed, a {{merit good}} creates {{positive}} externalities (an externality being a third party/spill-over effect which {{arises from the}} consumption or production of the good/service). This {{means that there is}} a divergence between private benefit and public benefit when a merit good is consumed (i.e. the public benefit is greater than the private benefit). However, as consumers only take into account private benefits when consuming <b>merit</b> <b>goods,</b> it means that they are under-consumed (and so under-produced).|$|E
5000|$|In many cases, <b>merit</b> <b>goods</b> provide {{services}} {{which it is}} argued should apply universally to everyone in a particular situation, a view that {{is close to the}} concept of primary goods found in work by philosopher John Rawls or discussions about social inclusion. On the supply side, it is sometimes suggested that there will be more support in society for implicit redistribution via the provision of certain kinds of goods and services, rather than explicit redistribution through income. Alternatively, it is sometimes suggested that society in general may be {{in a better position to}} determine what individuals need (such arguments are often criticised for being paternalistic, often by those who would like to reduce to a minimum economic activity by government).|$|E
50|$|Taxpayers' money help {{to pay for}} {{the items}} on the federal budget. The gap between revenue (money {{collected}} via taxes) and spending is known as the budget deficit. The money the federal government borrows to cover the budget deficit is what creates the national debt. The government spends money for a variety of reasons: reduce inequality (“safety net” programs), provide public goods (fire, police, national defence), provide important public services like education and health (<b>merit</b> <b>goods),</b> debt interest payments, transport and military spending. The “safety net” programs are initiatives that give extra financial support to the elderly, unemployed, disabled and the poor. Examples include the earned income tax credit, child tax credits, unemployment insurance, food stamps, subsidized school meals, low-income housing assistance, energy assistance and more. The federal government spends its money in four major ways: direct payments, grants, contracts and insurance.|$|E
5000|$|In his paper, [...] "A Multiple Theory of Budget Determination," [...] {{published}} in Finanzarchiv 1957, Musgrave introduced the economic concept of <b>merit</b> <b>good</b> (and later, de-merit good). The concept {{has been extensively}} discussed elsewhere and been quite controversial in economic theory.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>merit</b> and demerit <b>goods</b> can {{be defined}} in a {{different}} way which makes it different from externalities. The essence of <b>merit</b> and demerit <b>goods</b> is to do with an information failure to the consumer. This arises because consumers do not perceive quite how good or bad the good is for them: either {{they do not have the}} right information or lack relevant information. With this definition, a <b>merit</b> <b>good</b> is defined as good that is better for a person than the person who may consume the good realises.|$|R
40|$|We {{ask whether}} the {{objective}} of egalitarian allocation of a <b>merit</b> <b>good</b> could be achieved by making the good available at multiple outlets charging different money and time prices. Differential pricing could separate high and low wage buyers across outlets, and proportional allocation of supply could ensure that consumption is made independent of income, but dependent on relative strength of preference for the good. Thus, the standard efficiency costs of allocation by time are reduced. We find that differential pricing can achieve egalitarian distribution if preferences are homogenous and labour supply is upward sloping. Slight deviations occur if labour supply is backward bending, or preference for the <b>merit</b> <b>good</b> relative to other goods varies across the population. ____________________________________________________________________...|$|R
5000|$|Social {{marketing}} is a discipline {{that began in}} 1971, with Kotler and Zaltman. It is defined as an [...] "adaptation of commercial marketing technologies to programs designed to influence the voluntary behavior of target audiences to improve their personal welfare {{and that of the}} society of which they are a part". Social marketing uses more traditional commercial techniques and strategies, focusing on selling, to achieve goals for the greater social good. Its campaigns can either encourage <b>merit</b> <b>goods,</b> as for example fund raising for not-for-profit organizations or dissuade the use of demerit goods promoting society's well being, as non-smoking campaigns or promote the use of seat belts. Another characteristic of social {{marketing is}} that is planned to influence individuals' behavior to improve their well-being. It includes [...] "more than just advertising in print media, radio or television", it includes sponsorship or online marketing and is usually planned or implemented by governmental and nongovernmental organizations.A clear example that differentiates societal from social marketing is a marketing campaign on non-smoking. A focusing smoking cessation advertisement is an example of social marketing, but if the marketing strategies and techniques used in that campaign focus on increasing the well-being of society, that same campaign can be an example of societal marketing.|$|E
40|$|<b>Merit</b> <b>goods</b> {{are defined}} here as goods for which {{government}} {{interference with the}} aggregated willingness to pay increases utility. The paper argues that three cases exist where consideration for <b>merit</b> <b>goods</b> {{would lead to a}} Pareto improvement and where <b>merit</b> <b>goods</b> should therefore be reintegrated into the public economics framework. The state may be better informed about the conditions for the possibility of certain consumer wants. In cases of multiple preference orders within one person, the state may need to play a role if market preferences and reflective preferences are to converge. And the state may be needed to internalize psychological externalities. The inclusion of the <b>merit</b> <b>goods</b> concept may explain how some policies, like schooling policy, may increase overall well-being, whereas the classical public economics framework is unable to do so. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the status that the concept of <b>merit</b> <b>goods</b> (as first stated by Musgrave in The Theory of Public Finance) has/should have in Rawls's theory.

Next, we claim that the attitude of the 'second' Rawls about it is rather ambiguous and vacillates between exclusion and inclusion.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} {{to identify and}} evaluate marginal tax reforms when <b>merit</b> <b>good</b> arguments and environmental concerns are given explicit consideration. It {{is applied to the}} Norwegian indirect tax system for 1999. The analysis shows that the reform passed in Parliament in November 2000 had a clear redistributive profile: a lowering of the VAT rate on food items and the introduction of a VAT on services benefits households in the lowest seven deciles while the upper three deciles got worse off. But we also argue that the aggregate demand responses triggered an increase in greenhouse gasses. Next, we show that if the 2000 reform had been complemented with tax rates rate changes on other products, it could have made every decile better off. Finally, we present socially optimal reforms, under different weights on inequality and the environment. indirect tax reform; <b>merit</b> <b>good</b> arguments; greenhouse gasses...|$|R
40|$|Musgrave’s {{so-called}} <b>merit</b> <b>goods,</b> {{introduced in}} 1957, intend {{to deal with}} the situations where the social weight or concern of a good differs from the information given by individual preferences. <b>Merit</b> <b>goods</b> are often referred to as a case for government intervention in education, health care or biodiversity protection policies…. But the theoretical roots of this concept seem a bit fuzzy and are, at best, very controversial. To put it crudely, what –if anything- can justify that government choices rule out individual choices? The paper tries to answer this question. What role do <b>merit</b> <b>goods</b> play in economic theory? The first part of the paper defines the concept of merit good and emphasizes the theoretical issues at stake. The second part studies in what way the concept of merit good can be compatible with economic theory. We show, in particular, how this concept fits well with the development related to individual decision making theory, known as behavioural economics. ...|$|E
