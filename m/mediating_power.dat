Made Europe lurch suddenly to the other side, as we phrased it,--other gunwale now under water. Wherefore, in Heaven's name, trim your ship again, if possible, ye high mediating Powers. This the mediating Powers were laudably alert to do. Duc de Bourbon, and his young King about to marry, were of pacific tendencies; anxious for the Balance: still more was Fleury, who succeeded Duc de Bourbon. Cardinal Fleury (with his pupil Louis XV. under him, producing royal progeny and nothing worse or better as yet) began, next year, his long supremacy in France; an aged reverend gentleman, of sly, delicately cunning ways, and disliking war, as George I. did, unless when forced on him: now and henceforth, no <b>mediating</b> <b>power</b> more anxious than France to have the ship in trim.|$|E

Happily old Kur-Pfalz did not die in his Majesty's time; survived his Majesty several years: so that the matter fell into other hands,--and was settled very well, near a century after.|$|R

Michel Foucault has proposed for modern literary criticism the interpretive mode of the "author function," by which literary critics can domesticate or reject a text that is potentially transgressive.

This study utilises a predominantly qualitative methodology to explore how 14 women diagnosed with depression describe interactions with health practitioners. Building on previous theoretical positions, we develop a framework to encompass the complexities of the women's accounts, providing insight intoprocesses by which women and health practitioners co-construct healthcare interactions. The findings suggest that for these women, the commonly posited dichotomy between understandings of depression as either a biomedical or Sociocultural construct was less salient than, and mediated by, issues of control and communication. Financial and systemic considerations emerged as contextual mediators of both the women's and health practitioners' degree of control in working towards improved health outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Religion {{was always}} {{perceived}} as the threshold between two worlds. It is a space where individuals {{are supposed to be}} connected to a different reality through the <b>mediating</b> <b>power</b> of a particular ritual, at a specific time and in a certain space. A new space of appearance is the expected outcome along with this relocation from profane to sacred. Religious broadcasting could be conceptualized as a visual and acoustic “altar”. The ritual, space and time are the pillars of this audio-visual “cathedral ” the very space that could build the bridge between sacred and profane, and the means for this mediated, symbolic transfer. This paper tries to outline the power of media representation in the context of religious broadcasting that uses ritual and imagination to maintain and negotiate the distinction between sacred and profane and to generate alternative narratives. In this regard, the religious broadcasting, presuming the sacerdotal role to represent, mediate and interpret the relationship between sacred and profane is being conditioned by a ritualized medium. As a result, the religious messages could end up as a ritualized mystification that would jeopardize the production of meaning...|$|E

This foreign policy line could be considered as an asset for Turkey’s prospects of EU membership. The current EU discourse of constructing Europe as a ‘global actor’ necessitates a strong EU presence in the wider neighbourhood. A Turkey that can effectively use its soft power resources could significantly help to remedy the weakness of the EU presence in these regions. Furthermore, it could help prevent the region’s sources of instability from spilling over into the EU. In many respects, Turkey may be viewed as ‘doing the European Neighbourhood Policy’ for the EU.

It was said that the plan, [...] "based on calculations of unquestionable impartiality" [...] endeavored to effect compensation for recognized losses while “maintaining the pre-war balance of power between the key German rulers", two goals that were somewhat contradictory. [...] The original rationale for compensation, which had been to compensate strictly for territory lost, had been replaced by political objectives: to favor powerful or well-connected rulers and to woo potential allies.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore {{the ways in which}} the {{meanings}} of history, identity, and reality are constructed in Don DeLillo’s Libra and Mao II. While these novels do not deny the existence of “the real”, they demonstrate how any meaning assigned to it is not “out there” to be discovered, but rather created through the use of textuality and narrative. The novels show how so-called “Masters” and the mass visual media participate in constructing meaning by inventing and distributing these narratives, narratives that are written within specific ideological frameworks. This constructivist theme will be explored in light of postmodern theory, narrative theory, media theory, and theories on photography. The theories of Linda Hutcheon and Hayden White will be juxtaposed with those of Jean Baudrillard, suggesting that in Libra and Mao II, DeLillo portrays a world similar to Baudrillard’s “hyperreality” with a proliferation of simulations and simulacra, while at the same time, like Hutcheon and White, rejecting Baudrillard’s loss of “the real” and claiming instead that “the real” has always been mediated by our representations of it.

40|$|The {{way that}} the built {{environment}} represents and accommodates people of different cultures is an important facet of developing a holistically sustainable future. Architecture intervenes, maps and signifies {{and in doing so}} it constructs identities. It helps to shape how we know the world by <b>mediating</b> <b>power,</b> social relations and cultural values. Events such as the settlement, inhabitation and establishment of diasporic communities involve the occupation of space. Architecture provides the armature of this space, its form and its image. Building is a potent means by which identity can be formed. A most significant part of people’s well-being and capacity is their participation in literally building communities. This paper will illustrate this issue through discussion of contemporary Australian cities. The buildings {{of a wide variety of}} immigrants to Australia have since the 1950 s contributed greatly to the changing nature of its cities. They are the physical manifestation of the great demographic changes that have occurred across the nation during this period. The combination of people of different backgrounds and cultures lends a unique quality to Australian built environments, and this needs not only be understood but celebrated, as they are contributing to the development of Australian urban culture. Increased knowledge and understanding of the impact of immigration and multiculturalism on our built environment will add substantially to understanding of the diversity of Australia’s cultural heritage, and the potential of future planners, architects, and members of the general public to create inclusive and dynamic Australian cities. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Background to {{the topic}} Institutional {{ethnography}} (Smith 2005) is a theory and method of inquiry that foregrounds individual standpoint to reveal the coordination of social relations, particularly through the <b>mediating</b> <b>power</b> of texts. However, there is little {{in the literature on}} IE that explores the process of researcher reflexivity and the avoidance of ‘institutional capture’ and ‘privileged irresponsibility’ that it recommends. Focus of the enquiry There are particular tensions for institutional ethnographers in seeking to avoid objectification of participants through both ‘institutional capture’ and ‘privileged irresponsibility’ that can result from the imposition of researcher subjectivities in listening for and asking about texts. In this study, the Listening Guide (Mauthner and Doucet 1998), a narrative method that develops a relational analysis of the social, is used to develop such reflexivity: not to learn about the researcher per se, but to learn about the researcher’s location in the ‘relations of ruling’ (Smith 2005). Research methods and theoretical framework This presentation explores this process within an institutional ethnography of a primary school. It illustrates the use of the Listening Guide, in particular the researcher’s production of an ‘I’ poem after being interviewed by research participants. This promotes an ethical approach to researcher reflexivity, enabling an explicit analysis of the researcher’s subjectivities in the use of ethnographic methods and a deeper understanding of privilege and power {{on the part of the}} researcher. A significant concern in this research context is the researcher’s place in the education hierarchy. The approach works to mitigate researcher authority over the textual representations of the research participants, and minimise the danger of objectifying them. Research findings/contribution to knowledge The Listening Guide can be effectively used as a reflexive, analytic tool by institutional ethnographers. There is a common interest in the social production of experience and the researcher’s relationship with text. This example of an ethical approach to researcher reflexivity explicitly addresses a deficit in the current literature on IE...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} how relationship innovation {{can be developed}} in global collaborative partnerships (alliances, joint ventures, mergers, and acquisitions). The recently emerging theory of big data analytics linked with traditional organizational powers has attracted a growing interest, but surprisingly {{little research has been}} devoted to this important and complex topic. Therefore, after developing the theoretical foundations, our study empirically quantifies the links between the theoretical constructs based on the data collected from chief executive officers, managing directors, and heads of departments who work in contemporary global data-and-information driven collaborative partnerships. The results from structural equation modeling indicate that the relationship innovation depends on the power of big data analytics and non-mediated powers (expert and referent). The power of big data analytics also mediates the correlation between non-mediated powers and relationship innovation. However, <b>mediated</b> <b>powers</b> (coercive and manipulative) negatively affect the power of big data analytics and relationship innovation.

40|$|The {{wealth of}} {{evidence}} {{for the study of}} the economy of Late Bronze Age Ugarit in Syria has long been recognized. Attempts to investigate the Ugaritic economy have been hampered, however, by the application of rigid models to incomplete datasets. It is argued that previous questions about economic activity, as embedded in these rigid models as well as questions derived from the formalist-substantivist debate, were misdirected. Rather than asking what kind of economy Ugarit had or whether or not private exchange was possible, it is more productive to investigate how economic agents operated in different exchange networks and how elite actors could gain power by operating across more than one network. By applying a Network-based model (NBM) to both the textual and the archaeological data from the site of Ugarit, economic activities at the site are reconstructed without making totalizing statements, while still accommodating the variety of types of evidence. The textual evidence is investigated in detail, with special attention paid to the alphabetic economic texts and associated vocabulary. The archaeological evidence is examined separately and both types of data are then used in tandem to reconstruct ancient economic relationships. The people of Ugarit had numerous economic choices and possibilities, yet these choices were constrained by a number of factors, including the <b>mediating</b> <b>power</b> of institutions, which “framed” these options. It is argued that economic activity at Ugarit should not be viewed as a total system but as an effect of an emergent network of contingent exchange relationships. The palace, while not in control of the economy, was able to act as the most powerful economic actor through its unique position at the nodal point of several social and exchange relationships and perpetuated this dominance not through top-down administration but through the haphazard arrangement of receiving and distributing goods, transferring resources across networks. The emergent dominance of the palace facilitated the creation of various social relationships at Ugarit, mediated through exchange relationships. ...|$|E

The paper investigates {{the symbolism of the}} buildings [see Dovey, K. (1999) Framing Places: <b>Mediating</b> <b>Power</b> in Built Form. Routledge, London] as they are claimed and framed by local government; the use of the buildings and how this contributes to what we might call the overall assemblage or forming of the building [see Lees (Towards a critical geography of architecture: the case of ersatz colosseum. Cult. Geograp.; 2001 8 : 51 – 86), De Landa (2006) A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity, Continuum, London, Jacobs (A geography of big things, Cult.

In so doing, we argue that an investigation of architecture can offer key insights and contributions to debates in wider policy, particularly in relation to the values and affordances of ‘community’ in the UK today. By focusing on the community centre, we also shift the existing focus of much architectural research away from what Jacobs has called ‘big things’ [Jacobs (A geography of big things, Cult. Geograph. 2006; 13 : 1 – 27, pp. 4 – 5) ] onto ordinary, everyday and mundane architectures of community centres. Secondly, we argue that, particularly the newer breed of ‘community facing social enterprise centres’, construct and imagine notions of communities in inherently problematic ways, and while in some instances such productions and imaginings are disrupted through use, the architecture nevertheless continues to be claimed by local government as a powerful indicator of (a particular notion and construction of) community...|$|E

To that end, my goal is to provide an employee-centered perspective of self-regulated employment policy in America, and to demonstrate the degree of conflict (and eventual disputation) such policy creates for boundaryless workforces.

This year the old Bishop of Augsburg, one Brother of the older Kur-Pfalz Karl Philip, dies; nothing now between us and the event itself, but Karl Philip alone, who is verging towards eighty: the decision, to be peaceable, ought to be speedy! Friedrich Wilhelm, in January last, sent the expert Degenfeld, once of London, to old Karl Philip; and has him still there, with the most conciliatory offers: [...] "Will leave your Sulzbachs a part, then; will be content with part, instead of the whole, which is mine if there be force in sealed parchment; will do anything for peace!" [...] To which the old Kur-Pfalz, foolish old creature, is steadily deaf; answers vaguely, negatively always, in a polite manner; pushing his Majesty upon extremities painful to think of. [...] "We hate war; but cannot quite do without justice, your Serenity," [...] thinks Friedrich Wilhelm: [...] "must it be the eighty thousand iron ramrods, then?" [...] Obstinate Serenity continues deaf; and Friedrich Wilhelm's negotiations, there at Mannheim, over in Holland, and through Holland with England, not to speak of Kaiser and Reich close at hand, become very intense; vehemently earnest, about this matter, for the next two years. The details of which, inexpressibly uninteresting, shall be spared the reader.|$|R

[...] Many of the Midianites perished along with him ( [...] ; [...] ). These later references reflect the importance ascribed to the victories as symbols of God's <b>power</b> <b>mediated</b> through his chosen people.|$|R
