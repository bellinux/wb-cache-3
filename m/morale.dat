5|$|The Canadian Official Historian, C. P. Stacey {{wrote that}} several Canadian {{formations}} reported {{an increase in}} <b>morale.</b> Wilmot wrote that the bombing was essential because it raised the <b>morale</b> of the Second Army and depressed that of the German defenders.|$|E
5|$|The <b>morale</b> {{system in}} the game is similar to {{previous}} Dynasty Warrior games. <b>Morale</b> is increased and decreased by performing a number of positive actions for the player’s army. Action that produce this effect include defeating enemies in multiples of fifty, defeating enemy officers, and completing special events such as ambushes, siege attacks, and finding enemy strongholds. <b>Morale</b> in the game has a strong effect on the player's forces, determining their strength and speed, {{as well as their}} ability to perform Berwald attacks. <b>Morale</b> will also affect how the CPU characters move along through battle. Example: Ally Oxenstiernas are winning.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{wanted to}} {{maintain}} the threat of invasion by continuing air attacks on military targets in the British capital. Hans Jeschonnek still pushed for attacks on civilian <b>morale.</b> He argued that military and civilian industries were located too far apart to achieve a collapse of <b>morale</b> by attacking the former. Instead, he pressed for attacks against residential areas. Hitler refused. He ordered that only military targets in London were to be attacked.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{subsequently}} formed Army of the Potomac {{had high}} <b>morale</b> and was extremely {{proud of their}} general, some even referring to McClellan as the saviour of Washington. He prevented the army's <b>morale</b> from collapsing at least twice, {{in the aftermath of}} the First and Second Battles of Bull Run. Many historians argue that he was talented in this aspect.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL has {{suffered}} from serious <b>morale</b> and disciplinary problems since its establishment. These problems have been driven by uncertainty over the F-FDTL's role, poor conditions of service due to limited resources, tensions arising from FALINTIL's transition from a guerrilla organisation to a regular military and political and regional rivalries. The F-FDTL's <b>morale</b> and disciplinary problems have resulted in large numbers of soldiers being disciplined or dismissed. The East Timorese Government was aware of these problems before the 2006 crisis but did not rectify the factors that were contributing to low <b>morale.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{improvement}} in <b>morale</b> was {{aided by the}} arrival of some provisions, including much-needed blankets, on December 24.|$|E

5|$|As {{the battle}} escalates, the Inhumans arrive to aid Captain Marvel while Ulysses has {{a vision of}} Miles <b>Morales</b> killing Steve Rogers. In reaction, Captain Marvel places <b>Morales</b> under arrest. While Iron Man and Captain Marvel argue the merits of arresting <b>Morales,</b> Rogers gives <b>Morales</b> the {{opportunity}} to decide for himself and <b>Morales</b> asks to go home. As <b>Morales</b> leaves, Maria Hill places Iron Man's team under arrest but Doctor Strange teleports them to one of Nick Fury's safehouses. At the safehouse, the younger Avengers sneak off to find <b>Morales</b> before the adults. Meanwhile, Hill receives communication that <b>Morales</b> is at the United States Capitol, the location seen in Ulysses' vision.|$|R

5|$|Although the Americans {{had taken}} the vessel, Sterett had no orders to take prizes and so was obliged to release her. Enterprise {{completed}} her journey to Malta, and received honor and praise from the squadron's Commodore on her return to the fleet. The success of the battle boosted <b>morale</b> in the United States, since it was that country's first victory {{in the war against}} the Tripolitans. The opposite occurred in Tripoli, where <b>morale</b> sank heavily upon learning of Tripoli defeat. Despite Enterprise triumph, the war continued indecisively for another four years.|$|E
5|$|Although the UN {{casualties}} were moderate during the battle, the Third Battle of Seoul {{was a significant}} success for the Chinese military in Korea, and the UN forces' <b>morale</b> had sunk to its lowest point during the war. Ridgway was also extremely displeased {{with the performance of}} Eighth Army, which he had no control over due to the sudden death of Walker. Ridgway then took immediate steps to restore the <b>morale</b> and fighting spirit of the UN forces in Korea. With Ridgway leading the Eighth Army, MacArthur started to regain confidence in UN forces' ability to hold Korea, and the UN evacuation plan was abandoned on January 17.|$|E

50|$|Charles McGrath, {{the judge}} who {{originally}} sentenced <b>Morales</b> to execution, has announced {{that he has had}} a change of heart in the case. He now says he now doubts the testimony of an informant against <b>Morales.</b> Notably, the informant claimed that <b>Morales</b> confessed to him in Spanish, a language <b>Morales</b> does not speak. McGrath asked Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to grant <b>Morales</b> clemency under state law. In addition, <b>Morales</b> has claimed that he has found God in prison, and regrets the crime that he committed.|$|R

5|$|Animals bolstered <b>morale</b> at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in <b>morale,</b> horses {{could also be a}} health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. Horse manure was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.|$|E
5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} the <b>morale</b> of the {{workforce}} and locomotive engineers; crews {{were assigned to the}} same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. Other efforts to improve <b>morale</b> included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E
5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the <b>morale</b> of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine <b>morale,</b> particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E

5|$|Corley instituted {{sweeping}} changes in {{leadership in the}} regiment, hoping to improve its combat performance. He was able {{to cut down on}} straggling to a degree with more strict threats of court martial, but this had a negative effect on the regiment's <b>morale.</b> He began a unit newspaper, eventually called Eagle Forward, and moved to allow more discourse for the soldiers and leaders of the unit, and this was shown to improve the <b>morale</b> to a degree. Wanting to build a sense of pride in the unit, he sought to emphasize the toughness of the battles the regiment had seen, and played up its victory at the Battle of Yechon while downplaying other poor performances.|$|E
5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, battle {{was not necessary}} for either side; the main strategic theatre was mainland Greece itself. Although destroying the enemy navy {{would result in a}} clear strategic advantage for both sides, attempting this risked the loss of their own navy. The actions of the two sides thus reflect more upon their <b>morale</b> and confidence than on any strategic considerations. The Persians, seeing little to gain in battle, demoralised and riven with dissent, thus sought to avoid a naval battle. Conversely, the Allies, who had initially been as nervous of a battle as the Persians, sought to press home their <b>morale</b> advantage once they were informed {{of the state of the}} Persian fleet.|$|E

5|$|In early February 1942, Air Commodore George Jones, {{soon to be}} {{appointed}} Chief of the Air Staff, inspected NWA and found the <b>morale</b> and serviceability of its combat units—Nos.2, 12 and 13Squadrons—to be lacking.|$|E
5|$|In land engagements, {{players have}} an 18th-century army {{consisting}} of units such as cavalry, musketeers, riflemen and artillery. Each {{has its own}} intrinsic advantages, disadvantages, cost, and overall effectiveness. Players must use 18th-century tactics and formations to defeat their enemies. The battlefield terrain and the weather are also important. Factions can lay siege to settlements, replacing open land battles with street fighting and close-quarter combat. Each unit has <b>morale,</b> which increases if the battle goes well, or decrease after heavy casualties, army losses, coming under artillery bombardment, or {{with the death of}} the general. Tactical situations such as attacking from a flank or the rear, or depriving a unit of allied reinforcements, also hit <b>morale.</b> When a unit's <b>morale</b> is sufficiently depleted, it will be routed and flee the battlefield. Depending on whether <b>morale</b> is merely broken or entirely shattered, the player may be able to rally the unit and regroup. Victory is achieved by causing every enemy unit to rout, or be annihilated. In addition, sieges can be won if the attacker manages {{to take control of the}} settlement's central square for a set amount of time. Empire: Total War also introduces several new battlefield elements to the Total War series. Units can take cover behind walls or in buildings, allowing increased interactivity with the terrain and making some buildings points of tactical importance. Field defences may be constructed on the battlefield. Infantry units can also scale small obstacles such as walls and fences. Each unit has different capabilities such as Square Formation, Wedge, Diamond, Equip bayonets, or Fire at will.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{when the}} player confronts an enemy officer, the officer will {{challenge}} {{them to a}} one-on-one duel. If the player accepts, they will be transported to a small arena away from the main battlefield where a one-on-one fight with the officer will take place until either is victorious or time runs out. If the player declines, your <b>morale</b> will drop. If the player wins, their <b>morale</b> will rise and the enemy officer will {{be removed from the}} battlefield. If you accept the officers challenge they do become more difficult to beat in the duel.|$|E
