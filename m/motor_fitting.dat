5000|$|The boiler house, {{situated}} at the top end of the mills, near the smaller stack, contained one Lancashire boiler, of the Galloway type, made by Daniel Adamson and Co. This drove two duplicate horizontal compound engines. Coupled on {{to each of these}} were two mills. Eventually, the proprietors compounded both engines and added a mill to each. At {{the lower end of the}} works were two more Lancashire boilers of the same type, sizes, and make as that at the upper part. The mills throughout the works were two rolls high, and each had two pairs of standard housings. The annealing, pickling, cold rolls, tinning and assorting rooms, as well as the carpenters' and fitting shops, and the smithy, were situated on the higher level of the works. There were three reverberatory annealing furnaces, and two pickling machines. The tin-house contained fourteen tin-sets of the type known as the [...] "Melingriffith Patent"; fourteen Richard Thomas and Company's cleaners, and four dusting-machines. The tin-house machinery was driven by a 25 hp three-phase electric <b>motor.</b> The <b>fitting</b> shop contained four lathes, one screw-cutting machine, and one drilling machine.

The approach substitutes Double Fourier harmonic series for the PWM switching waveforms and the frequency response of the motor, to create a linear state space model of this type of load. The model requires the mid-frequency response (500 Hz - 20 kHz) of the induction motor impedance to be identified, and takes skin and proximity effects into account by adding parallel R-L networks to a standard motor model. Model parameters were measured by applying FFT analysis to variable frequency square waves injected into the <b>motor</b> terminals, and <b>fitting</b> parameter values to these measurements using a least squares minimisation method. From the analysis, {{it was found that the}} converter voltage balancing behavior degrades substantially at low motor speeds, and that a balance booster filter, as previously proposed, considerably improves the dynamic response.

2500|$|Scott's first {{experiments}} with a two-stroke {{were in a}} motor boat, where {{he was able to}} make tests and obtain 'diagrams' under working conditions. His first attempt at a <b>motor</b> cycle was <b>fitting</b> an engine of his own design to a Premier bicycle in 1901. This twin cylinder engine had steel cylinders with shrunk on aluminium radiator 'flanges', and drove the front wheel via friction directly to the tyre. He described the drive system as 'useless in the wet', and he could not prevent the cylinders from scoring. His next engine had cast iron cylinders of 2 1/4" [...] bore, and eventually drove by belt to clutch countershaft and then by chain to the rear wheel. Various ingenious ignition arrangements were used including link work driven by a pin placed mid-way on the connecting rod. In parallel to this he continued work on a 4" [...] bore, 4" [...] stroke marine engine which developed 10HP at 800rpm, fitted with a large water-cooled brake wheel (a dynamometer). By recording brake and indicator readings he was able to experiment with port shapes and piston shapes, developing the 'curved top' (deflector) piston.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare item difficulty of the FIM(TM) in 3 patient groups with neurological disorders. Subjects: Patients with stroke (n = 295), multiple sclerosis (n = 150), and traumatic brain injury (n = 88). Methods: FIM(TM) scores were administered in each group. The FIM(TM) consists of a motor domain (13 items) and a cognitive domain (5 items). Rasch rating scale analysis was performed to investigate differences in item difficulty (differential item functioning) between groups. Results: Answering categories of the FIM(TM) items were reduced to 3 (from the original 7) because of disordered thresholds and low answering frequencies. Two items of the motor domain ("bladder" and "bowel") did not fit the Rasch model. For 7 out of the 11 <b>fitting</b> <b>motor</b> items, item difficulties were different between groups (i. e. showed differential item functioning).

40|$|Brushless DC {{motor speed}} is {{controlled}} by synchronizing the stator coil current with rotor position in order to acquire an accurate alignment of stator rotating field with rotor permanent-magnet field for efficient transfer of energy. In order to accomplish this goal, a motor shaft is instantly tracked by using rotating rotor position sensors such as Hall effect sensors, optical encoders or resolvers etc. Adding sensors to detect rotor position affects the overall reliability and mechanical robustness of the system. Therefore, a whole new trend of replacing position sensors with sensorless rotor position estimation techniques have a promising demand. Among the sensorless approaches, Back-EMF measurement and high frequency signal injection is the most common. Back-EMF is an electromotive force, directly proportional to the speed of rotor revolutions per second, the greater the speed motor acquires the greater the Back-EMF amplitude appears against the motion of rotation. However, the detected Back-EMF is zero at start-up and does not provide motor speed information at this instant. There-fore, Back-EMF based techniques are highly unfavourable for low speed application specially near zero. On the other hand, signal injection techniques are comparatively developed for low or near zero motor speed applications and they also can estimate the on-line motor parameters exploiting the identification theory on phase voltages and currents signals. The signal injection approach requires expensive additional hardware to inject high frequency signal. Since, motors are typically driven with pulse width modulation techniques, high frequency signals are naturally already present {{which can be used}} to detect position. This thesis presents rotor position estimation by measuring the voltage and current signals and also proposes an equivalent permanent-magnet synchronous <b>motor</b> model by <b>fitting</b> thedata to a position dependent circuit model...|$|R

For example, {{it remains to be}} elucidated how the different phases of an action (i. e., preparation, initiation and execution) are expressed in neural oscillations and how these are affected by normal ageing. The interest in ageing-related changes of motor performance and the neural basis thereof are governed by the quest for more detailed insights into the possible reorganization of the key phases of an action. For this reason, it is apt and timely to study ageing-dependent effects on the neural organization of motor performance in more detail. The crucial point of such investigations is the study of synchronization, a key mechanism underlying the coordination of distinct neural populations in shaping complex motor tasks. In an earlier EEG-study [1] on young adults, we found that when generating unilateral index-finger movements, local oscillations in the δ-θ frequency band over the centroparietal, central and frontocentral regions (corresponding to the primary motor area (M 1), the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the pre-motor area (PM), respectively) exhibited robust phase locking both prior to and during the movement. The local oscillations were most pronounced in the hemisphere contralateral to the moving hand in both externally and internally triggered actions. A subsequent study [2] using an identical experimental paradigm with a population of older adults found that the local phase locking in the δ-θ frequency band was also present during the motor acts of the older participants. To investigate the neural processes underlying ageing-related dependence of the motor performance in more detail, we employed inter-regional phase-locking analysis by calculating the phase-locking values (PLVs) from the EEG records of the two data sets mentioned above. PLV measures the extent of instantaneous synchronization between two distinct brain regions. Our analysis revealed significant PLV in both age groups in the δ-θ frequencies around movement onset. Invariant sub-networks were established by strong PLV between brain areas involved in the motor act, which were different in older and younger subjects. More intra- and inter-hemispheric PLVs occurred in older than in younger subjects. Furthermore, data suggest that older subjects compensate for the diminished connectivity observed between contralateral M 1 and SMA, and ipsilateral PM and SMA during movement preparation and execution by establishing additional intra- and inter- hemispheric connections. Based on the above findings on local and inter-regional phase locking, we built a mathematical model consisting of phase oscillators representing two main regions of the motor network, i. e. SMA and M 1. This simple model is capable of reproducing the effects of increased PLI and, independently of this, the effect of increased PLV between both regions. After extending the network model to all core <b>motor</b> regions and <b>fitting</b> the model parameters to the experimental data it will serve as a tool to make predictions on disturbed networks dynamics, e. g. decoupling of nodes.
