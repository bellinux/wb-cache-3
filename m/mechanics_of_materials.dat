25|$|The {{simplest}} {{of the three}} methods here discussed, the <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> method is available for simple structural members subject to specific loadings such as axially loaded bars, prismatic beams {{in a state of}} pure bending, and circular shafts subject to torsion. The solutions can under certain conditions be superimposed using the superposition principle to analyze a member undergoing combined loading. Solutions for special cases exist for common structures such as thin-walled pressure vessels.|$|E
25|$|Each {{method has}} {{noteworthy}} limitations. The method of <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> {{is limited to}} very simple structural elements under relatively simple loading conditions. The structural elements and loading conditions allowed, however, are sufficient to solve many useful engineering problems. The theory of elasticity allows the solution of structural elements of general geometry under general loading conditions, in principle. Analytical solution, however, is limited to relatively simple cases. The solution of elasticity problems also requires the solution {{of a system of}} partial differential equations, which is considerably more mathematically demanding than the solution of <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> problems, which require at most the solution of an ordinary differential equation. The finite element method is perhaps the most restrictive and most useful at the same time. This method itself relies upon other structural theories (such as the other two discussed here) for equations to solve. It does, however, make it generally possible to solve these equations, even with highly complex geometry and loading conditions, with the restriction that there is always some numerical error. Effective and reliable use of this method requires a solid understanding of its limitations.|$|E

25|$|Mechanical {{engineers}} typically use mechanics in {{the design}} or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were {{the design of a}} vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. <b>Mechanics</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{approaches}} to the analysis: the <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> approach (also known as strength of materials), the elasticity theory approach (which is actually a special case of the more general field of continuum mechanics), and the finite element approach. The first two make use of analytical formulations which apply mostly to simple linear elastic models, lead to closed-form solutions, and can often be solved by hand. The by and finite element approach is actually a numerical method for solving differential equations generated by theories of mechanics such as elasticity theory and strength of materials. However, the finite-element method depends heavily on the processing power of computers and is more applicable to structures of arbitrary size and complexity.|$|E
25|$|The {{finite element}} method approximates a {{structure}} as an assembly of elements or components with various forms of connection between them and each element of which has an associated stiffness. Thus, a continuous system such as a plate or shell is modeled as a discrete system with {{a finite number of}} elements interconnected at finite number of nodes and the overall stiffness {{is the result of the}} addition of the stiffness of the various elements. The behaviour of individual elements is characterized by the element's stiffness (or flexibility) relation. The assemblage of the various stiffness's into a master stiffness matrix that represents the entire structure leads to the system's stiffness or flexibility relation. To establish the stiffness (or flexibility) of a particular element, we can use the <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> approach for simple one-dimensional bar elements, and the elasticity approach for more complex two- and three-dimensional elements. The analytical and computational development are best effected throughout by means of matrix algebra, solving partial differential equations.|$|E

[...] The physical and mathematical formulation of the subject is built upon the <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> and continuum mechanics and focuses on computations involving elastic, viscoelastic, and plastic bodies in static or dynamic contact. Contact mechanics provides necessary information for the safe and energy efficient design of technical systems and {{for the study of}} tribology, contact stiffness, electrical contact resistance and indentation hardness. Principles of contacts mechanics are implemented towards applications such as locomotive wheel-rail contact, coupling devices, braking systems, tires, bearings, combustion engines, mechanical linkages, gasket seals, metalworking, metal forming, ultrasonic welding, electrical contacts, and many others. Current challenges faced in the field may include stress analysis of contact and coupling members and the influence of lubrication and material design on friction and wear. Applications of contact mechanics further extend into the micro- and nanotechnological realm.|$|E

Based on the {{machining}} pattern, <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> removal and theory of micro-indentation, {{in previous studies}} the models <b>of</b> <b>material</b> removal rate <b>of</b> hard-brittle <b>materials</b> was discussed through the relatively influencing factors of machining parameters from various aspects, reflecting the research advances on <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> removal <b>of</b> hard-brittle <b>materials.</b> However, those models <b>of</b> <b>material</b> removal rate have limitations, which results from impercipient theory of fracture of new kinks <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> randomicity <b>of</b> practical machining process, inappropriate assumptions and simplification of {{the machining}} conditions and so on.
