Methods : 50 elderly patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic neuropathy (NPD) participated in this study. Risk of falling was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Fear of falling was assessed {{by means of the}} Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I). Muscle mass was assessed by tetrapolar bioimpedance analysis (BIA) and Janssen's equation. Subjects were divided into two groups: one with a history of falls in the six months before study enrollment (G 1) and the other without history of falls (G 2). Results : There were statistically significant differences between G 1 and G 2 regarding lean body mass (p < 0. 05), risk of falls as measured by the BBS (p < 0. 01), and fear of falling as measured by the FES-I (p < 0. 01). In addition, there was a significant correlation between the BBS and BIA (r = 0. 45 and p < 0. 01), showing that the greater the lean body mass, the lower the risk of falling. Conclusions : We found an association between lean <b>mass,</b> <b>risk</b> of falls and fear of falling in elderly adults with DNP and a history of falls from own height...|$|E

As the Aviation Ground Power Unit evolves or is replaced, it will be necessary to reduce life cycle costs and improve availability. This thesis explores the requirements and offers potential architectures and component selection to satisfy the Army Aviation Ground Power Unit requirements while increasing value. Using the current system as a baseline, alternatives were compared using performance, mass, envelope, reliability, and life cycle costs. The power plant proved to be the most important component in the architectures examined. Power plant influence on the life cycle cost of the system was the dominant factor among the selection criteria; fuel and power plant maintenance costs were the largest contributors to system life cycle costs. The research concludes that architectures with diesel engine power plants are preferred even though these architectures have an inherent <b>mass</b> <b>risk</b> and require greater interaction between aviation and ground maintenance activities.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{widespread}} belief that testosterone supplementation {{increases the risk of}} atherosclerotic heart disease, evidence to support this premise is lacking. Although supraphysiological doses of testosterone, such as those used by athletes and recreational body builders, decrease plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations, replacement doses of testosterone have had only a modest or no effect on plasma HDL in placebo-controlled trials. In epidemiological studies, serum total and free testosterone concentrations have been inversely correlated with intra-abdominal fat <b>mass,</b> <b>risk</b> of coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Testosterone administration to middle-aged men is associated with decreased visceral fat and glucose concentrations and increased insulin sensitivity. Testosterone infusion increases coronary blood flow. Similarly, testosterone replacement retards atherogenesis in experimental models of atherosclerosis. However, the long-term risks and benefits of testosterone administration in human immunodeficiency virus– infected men with fat redistribution syndrome have not been studied in randomized clinical trials. There is a widespread perception that testosterone supplementation adversely affects the plasma lipopro-tein profile and increases the risk of atherosclerotic heart disease; this premise is not supported by dat...|$|E

40|$|Pituitary abscess is a {{relatively}} uncommon cause of pituitary hormone deficiencies and/or a suprasellar <b>mass.</b> <b>Risk</b> factors for pituitary abscess include prior surgery, irradiation and/or pathology of the suprasellar region as well as underlying infections. We present {{the case of a}} 22 -year-old female presenting with a spontaneous pituitary abscess in the absence of risk factors described previously. Her initial presentation included headache, bitemporal hemianopia, polyuria, polydipsia and amenorrhoea. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her pituitary showed a suprasellar mass. As the patient did not have any risk factors for pituitary abscess or symptoms of infection, the diagnosis was not suspected preoperatively. She underwent transsphenoidal resection and purulent material was seen intraoperatively. Culture of the surgical specimen showed two species of alpha hemolytic Streptococcus, Staphylococcus capitis and Prevotella melaninogenica. Urine and blood cultures, dental radiographs and transthoracic echocardiogram failed to show any source of infection that could have caused the pituitary abscess. The patient was treated with 6 weeks of oral metronidazole and intravenous vancomycin. After 6 weeks of transsphenoidal resection and just after completion of antibiotic therapy, her headache and bitemporal hemianopsia resolved.

40|$|A National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) study team {{evaluated}} surface power {{needs for}} a conceptual crewed 500 -day Mars mission. This study had four goals: 1. Determine estimated surface power {{needed to support}} the reference mission; 2. Explore alternatives to minimize landed power system mass; 3. Explore alternatives to minimize Mars Lander power self-sufficiency burden; and 4. Explore alternatives to minimize power system handling and surface transportation mass. The study team concluded that Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) oxygen propellant production drives the overall surface power needed for the reference mission. Switching to multiple, small Kilopower fission systems can potentially save four to eight metric tons of landed mass, as compared to a single, large Fission Surface Power (FSP) concept. Breaking the power system up into modular packages creates new operational opportunities, with benefits ranging from reduced lander self-sufficiency for power, to extending the exploration distance from a single landing site. Although a large FSP trades well for operational complexity, a modular approach potentially allows Program Managers more flexibility to absorb late mission changes with less schedule or <b>mass</b> <b>risk,</b> better supports small precursor missions, and allows a program to slowly build up mission capability over time.

40|$|CONTEXT: Alcoholism may {{interfere}} with nutritional status, but reports are often troubled by uncertainties about ingested diet and organ function, {{as well as by}} ongoing abuse and associated conditions. OBJECTIVE: To identify nutritional and body compartment changes in stable alcoholics without confounding clinical and dietetic variables, a prospective observational pilot study was designed. Three well-matched populations were considered: subjects with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, alcoholics without visceral disease, and healthy never-drinking adults (controls). METHODS: Subjects (n = 60) were asymptomatic males with adequate diet, no superimposed disease or complication, and alcohol-free for at least 6 months. After exclusions, 48 patients were compared. Variables encompassed dietary recall, bioimpedance analysis, biochemical profile and inflammatory markers. Main outcome measures were body fat, lean body mass, serum lipids, C-reactive protein, and selected minerals and vitamins. RESULTS: Both alcoholic populations suffered from reduced lean body mass (P = 0. 001), with well-maintained body fat. Magnesium was depleted, and values of vitamin D and B 12 correlated with alcohol abuse. LDL and total cholesterol was increased in alcoholics without pancreatitis (P = 0. 04), but not in those with visceral damage. C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A correlated with duration of excessive drinking (P = 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Undernutrition (diminished lean body <b>mass,</b> <b>risk</b> of magnesium and vitamin deficiencies) contrasted with dyslipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk. This second danger was masked during chronic pancreatitis but not in alcoholics without visceral disease. Further studies should focus special requirements of this population...|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of jeopardized myocardial mass {{is important in}} defining the effect of interventions during myocardial infarction. To quantitate the in vivo <b>mass</b> at <b>risk,</b> 2 -dimensional echocardiography (2 -D echo) and thallium- 201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed in 10 closed-chest dogs after circumflex coronary artery occlusion. The 2 -D images were manually digitized to compute left ventricular (LV) mass using a modified Simpson's rule algorithm. This measure of LV mass correlated well with the actual LV mass (r = 0. 97). Perfused myocardial mass was estimated from thallium SPECT images 4 hours after occlusion using a region-growing algorithm. After the dogs were killed, the jeopardized mass was outlined using a dual perfusion staining technique using triphenyltetrazolium chloride and Evans blue dye. The actual perfused mass was well estimated by the thallium images (r = 0. 96). The noninvasively determined <b>mass</b> at <b>risk</b> was calculated as: 2 -D mass [...] thallium SPECT mass, and correlated well with the pathologically determined <b>mass</b> at <b>risk</b> (r = 0. 91).

In response to the epidemic, a new crisis management program was implemented and tested in Taipei. Methodology and Principal Findings: Having noticed that transmission surged on weekends during the Keelung epidemic, Taipei City launched a multi-channel <b>mass</b> <b>risk</b> communications program that included short message service (SMS) messages sent directly to approximately 2. 2 million Taipei residents on Friday, October 12 th, 2007. The public was told to keep symptomatic students from schools and was provided guidelines for preventing {{the spread of the}} disease at home. Epidemiological characteristics of Taipei’s outbreak were analyzed from 461 sampled AHC cases. Median time from exposure to onset of the disease was 1 day. This was significantly shorter for cases occurring in family clusters than in class clusters (mean 6 SD: 2. 663. 2 vs. 4. 3964. 82 days, p = 0. 03), as well as for cases occurring in larger family clusters as opposed to smaller ones (1. 261. 7 days vs. 3. 964. 0 days, p, 0. 01). Taipei’s program {{had a significant impact on}} patient compliance. Home confinement of symptomatic children increased from 10 % to 60 % (p, 0. 05) and helped curb the spread of AHC. Taipei experienced a rapid decrease in AHC cases between the Friday of the SMS announcement and the following Monday, October 15, (0. 70 % vs. 0. 36 %). By October 26, AHC cases reduced to 0. 01 %.

Because of this relatively unique approach, {{there are a number}} of significant success stories that should be considered during the development of any future lunar landers or human spacecraft. This paper is divided into two separate themes; the first is the approach used during the conceptual design studies, including the systematic analysis cycles and the decision making process associated with each: and the second is a summary of the resulting lessons learned that were compiled after looking back at the lifetime of the Project. Altair was terminated before entering Phase B of its design, and was often criticized for being a very heavy and very large vehicle. While there was specific rationale for all of the decisions that led up to that configuration, future design cycles were specifically planned to re-address the mass challenge.

40|$|Summary We {{examined}} {{the relation between}} physical activity and endometrial cancer using data from a multicentre case-control study involving 405 endometrial cancer cases and 297 population controls. Estimates of recreational (i. e. active sport, walks and hikes) and nonrecreational activity (i. e. house cleaning, climbing stairs and walking or standing on the job) were obtained using interview information. After adjustment for age, study area, education, parity, years of use of oral contraceptives, years of use of menopausal oestrogens and cigarette smoking, recent recreational inactivity was associated with increased risk (RR = 1. 9 for lowest vs highest tertile). Similarly, recent nonrecreational inactivity was associated with increased risk (RR = 2. 2 for lowest vs highest tertile). Further adjustment for body mass and nonrecreational activity attenuated the association between risk and recent recreational inactivity (RR = 1. 2; 95 % CL = 0. 7 - 2. 0) but adjustment for body mass and recreational activity did not alter the association between risk and recent nonrecreational inactivity (RR = 2. 0; 95 % CL = 1. 2 - 3. 1).

40|$|Introduction: Both {{cardiovascular}} disease and osteoporosis are important causes of {{morbidity and mortality}} in the elderly. The co-occurrence of {{cardiovascular disease}} and osteoporosis prompted us to review the evidence of an association between cardiovascular (CV) disease and osteoporosis and potential shared common pathophysiological mechanisms. Methods: A systematic literature search (Medline, Pubmed and Embase) was conducted to identify all clinical studies that investigated the association between cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Relevant studies were screened for quality according to guidelines as proposed by the Dutch Cochrane Centre and evidence was summarized. Results: Seventy studies were included in this review. Due to a large heterogeneity in study population, design and outcome measures a formal meta-analysis was not possible. Six of the highest ranked studies (mean n = 2, 000) showed that individuals with prevalent subclinical CV disease had higher risk for increased bone loss and fractures during follow-up compared to persons without CV disease (range of reported risk: hazard ratio (HR) 1. 5; odds ratio (OR) 2. 3 to 3. 0). The largest study (n = 31, 936) reported a more than four times higher risk in women and more than six times higher risk in men. There is moderate evidence that individuals with low bone mass had higher CV mortality rates and incident CV events than subjects with normal bone <b>mass</b> (<b>risk</b> rates 1. 2 to 1. 4). Although the shared common pathophysiological mechanisms are not fully elucidated, the most important factors that might explain this association appear to be, besides age, estrogen deficiency and inflammation. Conclusions: The current evidence indicates that individuals with prevalent subclinical CV disease are at increased risk for bone loss and subsequent fractures. Presently no firm conclusions can be drawn as to what extent low bone mineral density might be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. © 2011 den Uyl et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} the feasibility and usefulness of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) {{in the evaluation}} of heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF) in elderly patients. MethodsPatients aged 65 and older hospitalized for symptomatic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 40 % underwent both CMR and 2 D echocardiographic assessment of cardiac volumes, mass and function. ResultsAmong 14 patients (mean age 80. 2 ± 8. 7 Y [66 - 91]), a good correlation was found between echocardiography and CMR for LVEF (56. 7 ± 8. 1 % vs 54. 3 ± 9. 2 %, r= 0. 8). Echocardiography mildly underestimated LV end diastolic volume (EDV) (55. 6 ± 25. 8 vs 67 ± 24. 1 mL/m 2, r= 0. 84) and end systolic volume (ESV) (24. 9 ± 15. 8 vs 31. 3 ± 13. 9 mL/m 2 r= 0. 66). Echocardiography overestimated the LV mass (87. 4 ± 23. 5 vs 64 ± 22. 3 g/m 2, r= 0. 5). Left atrial volume (assessed by CMR) was increased (52. 8 ± 24. 9 mL/m 2), 8 patients had atrial fibrillation with larger left atrial volume (71. 5 ± 26. 9 vs 38. 8 ± 10. 9 mL/m 2 for sinus rhythm, p 0. 008). Right ventricular (RV) EDV and ESV assessed by CMR were normal. Mean RVEF was 43. 7 ± 8. 7 % and RVEF was< 45 % in 8 (57 %) patients who also had lower LVEF (p= 0. 005) and higher pulmonary artery systolic pressure (p= 0. 01). Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was found in 8 cases, 4 with mid-wall LGE, 2 with subendocardial or transmural LGE and 2 with sub epicardial LGE. ConclusionCMR was feasible, safe and was a useful complement to echo-cardiography in elderly patients hospitalized for HFpEF. In this population, LVEF assessed by CMR and echocardiography were comparable. Echocardiography underestimated LV volumes and overestimated LV <b>mass.</b> <b>Risk</b> factors for adverse outcome such as RV dysfunction and the presence of LGE were found in {{more than half of the}} cases...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the prevalence and analyze risk factors associated to osteoporosis and low-trauma fracture in women. METHODS: Cross-sectional study including {{a total of}} 4, 332 women older than 40 attending primary care services in the Greater São Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, between 2004 and 2007. Anthropometrical and gynecological data and information about lifestyle habits, previous fracture, medical history, food intake and physical activity were obtained through individual quantitative interviews. Low-trauma fracture was defined as that resulting from a fall from standing height or less in individuals 50 years or older. Multiple logistic regression models were designed having osteoporotic fracture and bone mineral density (BMD) as the dependent variables and all other parameters as the independent ones. The significance level was set at p< 0. 05. RESULTS: The prevalence of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures was 33 % and 11. 5 %, respectively. The main risk factors associated with low bone mass were age (OR= 1. 07; 95 % CI: 1. 06; 1. 08), time since menopause (OR= 2. 16; 95 % CI: 1. 49; 3. 14), previous fracture (OR= 2. 62; 95 % CI: 2. 08; 3. 29) and current smoking (OR= 1. 45; 95 % CI: 1. 13; 1. 85).

40|$|The NASA {{project to}} develop In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) technologies, in {{partnership}} with commercial and international collaborators, has achieved full system demonstrations of oxygen production using native regolith simulants. These demonstrations included robotic extraction of material from the terrain, sealed encapsulation of material in a pressurized reactor; chemical extraction of oxygen from the material {{in the form of}} water, and the electrolysis of water into oxygen and hydrogen for storage and reuse. These successes have provided growing confidence in the prospects of ISRU oxygen production as a credible source for critical mission consumables in preparation for and during crewed missions to the moon and other destinations. Other ISRU processes, especially relevant to early lunar exploration scenarios, have also been shown to be practical, including the extraction of subsurface volatiles, especially water, and the thermal processing of surface materials for civil engineering uses and for thermal energy storage. This paper describes these recent achievements and current NASA ISRU development and demonstration activity. The ability to extract and process resources at the site of exploration into useful products such as propellants, life support and power system consumables; and radiation and rocket exhaust plume debris shielding, known as In-Situ Resource Utilization or ISRU, has the potential to significantly reduce the launch <b>mass,</b> <b>risk,</b> and cost of robotic and human exploration of space. The incorporation of ISRU into missions can also significantly influence technology selection and system development in other areas such as power, life support, and propulsion. For example. the ability to extract or produce large amounts of oxygen and/or water in-situ could minimize the need to completely close life support air and water processing system cycles, change thermal and radiation protection of habitats, and influence propellant selection for ascent vehicles and surface propulsive hoppers. While concepts and even laboratory work on evaluating and developing ISRU techniques such as oxygen extraction from lunar regolith have been going on since before the Apollo 11 Moon landing, no ISRU system has ever flown in space, and only recently have ISRU technologies been developed at a scale and at a system level that is relevant to actual robotic and human mission applications. Because ISRU hardware and systems have never been demonstrated or utilized before on robotic or human missions, architecture and mission planners and surface system hardware developers are hesitant to rely on ISRU products and services that are critical to mission and system implementation success. To build confidence in ISRU systems for future missions and assess how ISRU systems can best influence and integrate with other surface system elements, NASA, with international partners, are performing analog field tests to understand how to take advantage of ISRU capabilities and benefits with the minimum of risk associated with introducing this game-changing approach to exploration. This paper will describe and review the results of four analog field tests (Moses Lake in 6 / 08, Mauna Kea in 11 / 08. Flagstaff in 9 / 09; and Mauna Kea in 1 / 10) that have begun the process of integrating ISRU into robotic and human exploration systems and missions, and propose future ISRU-related analog field test activities that can be performed in collaboration with international space agencies...|$|E

Mammography- and MRI-guided procedures (both biopsies and localisations) are reserved for those lesions not visible on US, as those procedures are more uncomfortable and more time consuming than under US guidance.|$|R
