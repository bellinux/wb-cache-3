5|$|For {{the first}} six months of operation, the subway was {{operated}} as a single system, with trains from Eglinton Station running through to either Keele or Woodbine station, while other trains connected the latter two points. However, the manoeuvre made operation of both lines <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> <b>and</b> the practice was abandoned after the initial trial period, leaving Lower Bay Station abandoned.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December Hinkler, {{accompanied}} by John F. Leeming, {{president of the}} Lancashire Aero Club, made another attempt. The landing was no problem. On the steep slope and with a strong headwind the plane stopped quickly. Professor E. R. Dodds witnessed the landing. The uphill take-off was <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>and</b> the plane dived {{off the edge of}} the summit with insufficient airspeed, but picked up speed as it dived, narrowly missing Striding Edge, to return to Manchester.|$|E
5|$|In {{his opinion}} {{all human beings}} have the same {{abilities}} with regard to reason, feelings and imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations. According to him {{it is obvious that}} the culture on Tierra del Fuego is at a lower level of development than European culture, but he also admits that the conditions of life there are much <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>and</b> this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture. Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, {{the sport}} was pushed forward by American {{mathematician}} John Gill, who contributed several important innovations. Gill's previous athletic pursuit was gymnastics, a sport which had an established scale of difficulty for particular movements and body positions. He applied this idea to bouldering, which shifted the focus from reaching a summit to navigating a specific sequence of holds. Gill developed a closed-ended rating system: B1 problems were {{as difficult as}} the most challenging roped routes of the time, B2 problems were <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> <b>and</b> B3 problems were those that had only been completed once.|$|E
5|$|Many half-tracks, jeeps {{and trucks}} foundered in deep water; those {{that made it}} ashore soon became jammed up on the {{narrowing}} beach, making easy targets for the German defenders. Most of the radios were lost, making the task of organizing the scattered and dispirited troops even <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> <b>and</b> those command groups that did make the shore found their effectiveness limited to their immediate vicinity. Except for a few surviving tanks and a heavy weapons squad here or there, the assault troops had only their personal weapons, which, having been dragged through surf and sand, invariably needed cleaning before they could be used.|$|E
5|$|P.atriplicifolia is {{frequently}} propagated by cuttings. Because its woody crown is resistant to division, softwood cuttings {{are taken from}} shoots near the base, generally in late spring. Hardwood cuttings selected in mid-to-late summer also provide a viable propagation technique. The plant is also grown from seed in cultivation. Such seeds require exposure to cold for 30–160 days to germinate, and seed-raised specimens may not preserve the characteristics of named cultivars. In the commercial greenhouse or nursery setting, P.atriplicifolia relatively large size and rapid growth can adversely affect quality or make plants <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>and</b> expensive to transport; the use of plant growth regulators such as chlormequat chloride and daminozide may be more cost-effective than large-scale pruning.|$|E

5|$|Probably {{the easiest}} to recycle would be bismuth-containing fusible alloys {{in the form of}} larger objects, then larger {{soldered}} objects. Half of the world's solder consumption is in electronics (i.e., circuit boards). As the soldered objects get smaller or contain little solder or little bismuth, the recovery gets progressively <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>and</b> less economic, although solder with a higher silver content will be more worthwhile recovering. Next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair bismuth content, perhaps as bismuth phosphomolybdate, and then bismuth used in galvanizing and as a free-machining metallurgical additive.|$|E
5|$|The River Severn is {{considered}} a navigable river and Gloucester {{used to be an}} important port, with shipping having to deal with the bore. Vessels can ride the tide up from Sharpness to Gloucester. The tide will outstrip the vessel but by timing the journey correctly, a barge can reach Gloucester at high water. Descending is <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> <b>and</b> barges often needed to start their descent with one tide, lay up before crossing Longney Sands, and finish the descent at the next tide. These inconveniences in accessing Gloucester were overcome when the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal was opened in 1827, bypassing the need for shipping to use the river to reach Gloucester.|$|E
5|$|Elements {{that show}} tripositive ions with {{electronic}} configuration of a noble gas (scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, actinium) show a clear trend in their physical properties, such as hardness. At the same time, if group 3 is continued with lutetium and lawrencium, several trends are broken. For example, scandium and yttrium are both soft metals. Lanthanum is soft as well; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite {{far from the}} nucleus compared to the nuclei charges. Due to the lanthanide contraction, lutetium, the last in the lanthanide series, has a significantly smaller atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge, thus making the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> <b>and</b> thus making the metal harder. However, lutetium suits the previous elements better in several other properties, such as melting and boiling points. Very {{little is known about}} lawrencium, and none of its physical properties have been confirmed.|$|E

5|$|Far <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>and</b> {{protracted}} was the {{war against}} the ambitious governor of Ahwaz, Abu Abdallah al-Baridi, who aimed to supplant Ibn Ra'iq. Al-Baridi's family was of Basran origin, and had served the Abbasids in various roles as officials before managing to assert a weak hold over Khuzistan. Ibn Ra'iq himself was defeated and forced to leave Basra to the Baridis, but Bajkam saved the situation by scoring two major victories, despite being outnumbered, that allowed him to take possession of Khuzistan. The hard-pressed al-Baridi now turned to his powerful neighbour, the Buyid ruler of Fars, Ali ibn Buya, for help. Ali's brother Ahmad soon took over Khuzistan, and Ibn Ra'iq was forced to offer possession of the province as an independent domain if Bajkam would recover it. Bajkam however was repulsed by the Buyid forces, and fell back to Wasit.|$|E
5|$|In {{later years}} Warner said he regretted his {{decision}} to leave Stanford for Temple, and left because of concern about the school's changing funding priorities. The university leadership was planning to make Stanford primarily a graduate school; because {{of an increase in}} the number of junior colleges in California, the administration saw less need for undergraduate instruction at Stanford. Because fewer students were admitted, higher grade requirements for incoming students made admission <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>and</b> student athletes began enrolling at USC and California instead of Stanford. Warner soon realized that he had made the wrong decision; due to the economic effects of the Great Depression, the number of applicants to Stanford decreased significantly and athletes were again admitted. Temple upset the Florida Gators, coached by future Temple coach Josh Cody, 20–12 in Warner's last game.|$|E
5|$|Late that afternoon, {{after about}} a week of dry weather, it began to rain. As a result, the track became <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>and</b> {{mobility}} was reduced; the tanks found the track impassable {{and as a consequence}} the advancing Australian infantry lost their direct fire support. Resupply also proved to be a problem for them. The jeeps that had been bringing up supplies could not get forward and there were not enough native porters to meet the demand. As a result, the Australians had to resort to using one of their infantry battalions, the 2/24th, to bring supplies forward from Palanko while the 2/23rd continued the advance on Kuanko. Several isolated pockets of Japanese defenders were located along the track holding and so, while their sister battalion struggled up and down the steep track under the weight of their portage, on 1 December elements of the 2/23rd, leaving their heavy stores and equipment behind, advanced up a steep, muddy slope and set about clearing these positions. The Japanese resistance was overwhelmed and by midday the Australians entered Kuanko. Exploiting beyond the village in the afternoon, the lead Australian company took fire from a ridge line to the north-west and the advance was halted for the day.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the month}} of July, the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track's main {{straight}} was straightened and the Variante Goodyear and Seconda Variante chicanes were reconfigured by the race organisers to become a series of narrower corners with the exit away from the entry of turn one. The run-off areas around the two sections of the circuit were enlargened. Some of the drivers, however, were unhappy with the modifications, though, as there were fears of a multi-car accident on the first lap. Coulthard claimed that the new corner would make braking <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>and</b> was concerned over the amount of penalties issued to other competitors. However, Michael Schumacher believed his and other teams would be less concerned with suspension damage. Jean Alesi {{who was the first}} driver to test the new circuit, said that it would be easier for drivers to pull off the track {{in the event of a}} technical issue.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the British Band, and the Fox, Kickapoo, Sauk, Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi that later joined them, {{suffered}} unknown numbers of dead during the war. While some died fighting, others were tracked down and killed by Sioux, Menominee, Ho-Chunk, and other native tribes. Still others died of starvation or drowned during the Band's long trek up the Rock River toward {{the mouth of the}} Bad Axe. The entire British Band was not wiped out at Bad Axe; some survivors drifted back home to their villages. This was relatively simple for the Potawatomi and Ho-Chunk of the band. Many Sauk and Fox found return to their homes <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> <b>and</b> while some returned safely, others were held in custody by the army. Prisoners, some taken at the Battle of Bad Axe, and others taken by U.S.-aligned Native American tribes in the following weeks, were taken to Fort Armstrong at modern Rock Island, Illinois. About 120 prisoners – men, women, and children – waited until the end of August to be released by General Winfield Scott.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Soma Bringer was not {{released}} outside Japan: no explanation {{was given by}} Nintendo, although there was some speculation that its high text content was to blame. Its exclusivity to Japan has drawn both disappointment and criticism from some journalists, in addition to continued hope for a Western release: an article from IGN cited the release of Glory of Heracles as a possible precursor to a Western release, while gaming site Siliconera reported that Nintendo might release it in the West during the transitional phase between the DS and its successor the Nintendo 3DS, although the writer noted that Soma Bringers text-heavy approach made it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>and</b> thus less appealing to localize. To date, it remains exclusive to Japan. An unofficial open fan translation patch was created: while not complete, it translated the greater majority of text into English.|$|E
