The first problem was that distributors may publish binary files only—executable, but not readable or <b>modifiable</b> <b>by</b> humans.

This suggests that childhood amnesia offset is <b>modifiable</b> <b>by</b> parenting and teaching styles and is therefore not only predetermined or completely biological.|$|R

Two lines of mutant mice heterozygous for P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channels exhibited impaired plasticity of eye movement timing, but relatively intact plasticity of movement amplitude during motor learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The results thus demonstrate {{a distinction between the}} molecular signaling pathways regulating the timing versus amplitude of movements...|$|R
