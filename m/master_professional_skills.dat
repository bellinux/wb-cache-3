40|$|Legal English (LE) {{has evolved}} as a distinct, highly demanded part of ESP {{in the recent}} years of globalisation. Many {{specialised}} textbooks have been published lately, but the professional communication aspect lacks sufficient coverage. This article presents a project, which is a teaching manual entitled Legal English through Movies, that has grown from the author’s experience using video in the LE classroom. A general methodology of using authentic video in language teaching is briefly covered to explain why and how feature films were initially used by the author. The idea of using movies for developing law students’ professional communicative competence has shifted the emphasis from pure language training to forming <b>professional</b> communication <b>skills.</b> The applied method takes into consideration both linguistic and extra-linguistic factors of professional communication. Special attention is paid to language patterns typical of different communicative situations within various areas of legal practice along with peculiarities of cross-cultural communication. Not covering all spheres of LE teaching the results enhance education kits for such course topics as Criminal Law, Tort Law, and Civil Procedure as well as provide training materials for <b>mastering</b> <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> in typical communicative situations (lawyer - client, lawyer - lawyer, etc.). The approach introduced here can be expanded to different ESP fields as well...|$|R

40|$|Using a grounded-theory {{approach}} this study critically examines a development education program of an NGO, the Institute for Development Studies and Practices (IDSP) in Balochistan, Pakistan. IDSP’s Academic Development Program (ADP) {{is influenced by}} critical pedagogy, and post-colonial and post-modern studies. IDSP targets out-of-school youth and young adults of marginalized communities who are politically and socially conscious and looking for openings, inspirations, and direction to solve the issues confronting their communities. In addition to grounded theory itself, theoretical perspectives {{used in this study}} include: postmodern critical theory, transformative learning theory, critical pedagogy, and post-colonial studies. Data sources include ADP-related documents and open-ended interviews with four IDSP administrators, three teachers, six female students, and eight male students. I used convenience, purposive, and theoretical sampling techniques to select my research participants. To analyze my data, I utilized two major analytical tools, “content analysis” and “constant comparison” throughout the research process. The research findings reveal that ADP has developed critical consciousness in marginalized youth, improved their cultural self-esteem, enabled them to reclaim elements of their history and self-worth, and developed in them a sense of ownership and responsibility for their own knowledge. It has given them civic courage to raise their voice against exploitation, nepotism, and corruption and it has motivated them to connect with the world beyond their local region. Finally, it has enhanced their professional development capabilities. This study traces a model of epistemic empowerment of indigenous youth across eight categories: (i) fostering critical imagination and analytical skills, (ii) strengthening connections with local culture, (iii) <b>mastering</b> <b>professional</b> <b>skills,</b> (iv) initiating praxis, (v) breaking the culture of silence, (vi) embracing ethically and socially responsible knowledge, (vii) encountering resistance in applying emancipatory ideas, and (viii) becoming “universal. ” Case studies, particularly single case studies, are not generalizable in any sense to different contexts and time. However, the IDSP experience chronicled in this study through the eyes of direct stakeholders offers potential lessons for those who find themselves similarly situated in potentially comparable circumstances...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Life Long Learning, {{which has}} {{acquired}} great significance in recent years, is an urgent {{factor in the}} educational policy of many countries. LLL {{is considered to be}} a debatable issue among educators dealing with psychological, methodical and financial aspects of this phenomenon, because of the number of approaches to it. Nevertheless, the concept of LLL presupposes some basic features, such as the presence of the educational environment at any schooling age, the variety of learning trajectories and the established system of improvement of <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> and abilities. Special importance is given to the professional development of educators, who are not only transmitters and translators of scientific doctrines but are responsible for the formation of spiritual values of the younger generation. There are a number of different programmes in the EU that focus on satisfying the growing needs of sustaining mental fitness and potential employability of people. The field of university education in Russia has both similarities and differences with the learning strategies of the EU. The implementation of LLL technologies among Russian university teachers is present now in three major forms: <b>mastering</b> English, improving <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> and providing computerized learning environments. It is concluded that professional development of educators occupies one of the most promising areas in the paradigm of LLL, due to the fact that professional qualifications o...|$|R
