40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the issue of payment for goods or {{services}} by mobile phones. The area of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> is a potential future payment system. To {{the extent to which the}} <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> in the future be used, however, depends not only on individual applications and technologies but also the readiness of potential users of these technologies and the willingness of users is fully used. The goal of this publication is to provide a comprehensive picture of this issue, analyze the possibility of using different technologies for <b>mobile</b> phone <b>payments,</b> to map the current situation in the segment of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> and provide insight into the possible future development. The work can be divided into three parts. First, the theoretical part, defines <b>mobile</b> <b>payments,</b> says the reader into the introduction of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> and describes the possibility of using these technologies. Second, the practical part, the analysis of the questionnaire.

When evaluating a questionnaire is given priority to conclude that could be used in the introduction of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments.</b> The third part is an example of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> applications in other fields. Readers of this thesis would have to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the issue of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments,</b> technology and applications of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments.</b> Alternatively, to obtain information about how to use these payments in their business...|$|R
40|$|Mobile payments—those {{initiated}} on a mobile device {{such as a}} cell phone or tablet computer—have received {{a significant amount of}} attention recently. Yet, despite the attention, <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> have not been widely adopted in the United States. While industry experts agree <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> eventually will take off, there are many barriers. Some barriers are on the supply side—for example, the difficulty of getting industry participants to agree on technological standards and the lack of compelling business models for participants. Barriers, however, also exist on the demand side. The main demand-side barrier has been the uncertain value of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> to U. S. consumers. In some other countries, there have been obvious advantages to consumers of using <b>mobile</b> <b>payments.</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>payments</b> were adopted rapidly in Japan as a convenient way of paying for mass transit.

40|$|This study {{belongs to}} the field of {{innovation}} research and is based on the application of a theoretical concept of a technology acceptance. The theoretical concept developed {{in the context of this}} research work is investigating the connection between efficiency, quality, security and business process re-engineering and the intention to adopt <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> technologies by merchants within the retail industry. <b>Mobile</b> <b>payments</b> is an emerging topic which is currently experiencing a rise. Although there are significant differences in a level of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> acceptance around the world, the widespread adoption of the technology has not prevailed yet. Moreover, more research is needed to investigate and explain retailers’ prospective on the <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> adoption. The growing scientific interest in this topic is relevant in terms of innovation development, theories of global competition platforms and evolving landscape of global payment systems. From this holistic prospective the fundamental hypotheses and crucial questions in terms of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> adoption by merchants were derived. The analysis of the data sample of 90 companies of various sizes and operating in different industries obtained by means of a survey conducted at one of the largest trade fairs in Munich, Germany in autumn 2015. The data was analyzed using descriptive univariate and multivariate methods and the significance of the conceptual framework was validated. A major positive trend in <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> adoption was indicated. The findings of this research suggest that efficiency had a significant positive influence on the intention to adopt <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> by merchants. Banks and credit card companies were recognized as the most preferred <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> providers among retailers with an increasing interest towards independent companies. Based on the findings, the scientific guidelines for the future research were outlined and the concrete recommendations from the managerial prospective for achieving a successful adoption of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> among merchants were suggested...|$|R

2500|$|Michael Spence {{wrote that}} [...] "Now comes a … powerful, wave of digital {{technology}} that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and disintermediation has been underway for some time in service sectors—think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, <b>mobile</b> <b>payment</b> systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading {{to the production of}} goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor." [...] In his view, {{the vast majority of the}} cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. 3D printers) and, more important, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. [...] "Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [...] are compelling." [...] Spence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies [...] "is cost reduction via the replacement of labor." [...] For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is [...] "easy to imagine" [...] that production may become [...] "extremely" [...] local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear in both developed and developing countries. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion. Spence writes that [...] "the world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital, not goods, services, and traditional capital. Adapting to this will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution." ...|$|E

40|$|Widespread {{adoption}} of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> {{has not taken}} place despite a decade of trials in various countries based upon a mobile phone handset {{that does not have}} the technology capabilities of today’s smart phones. However, significant technology developments have led to widespread consumer {{adoption of}} smart phones and other devices that may now provide the foundation for wider consumer adoption of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments.</b> Understanding UK consumer cultural perceptions on the new phenomenon {{is one of the first}} steps to influencing purchase behaviour. This thesis is based upon a post-positivist philosophy and a social constructionist ontology that explores UK consumer perceptions of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> through human cognitive and affective responses of consumer payment behaviour as these influence attitude that leads to adoption. However, UK consumer interest in <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> on its own is unlikely to be enough to change payment behaviour, although meeting specific payment needs can motivate consumers to amend their payment behaviour that can lead to widespread adoption. Inductive empirical research is used to explore UK consumer perceptions of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> through sequential mixed methods. A questionnaire is used as the 1 st research instrument with closed questions that explore various aspects of consumer interest in the <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> phenomenon. The key themes identified from the numerical analysis of the questionnaire data are used to guide the semi-structured interviews. Content analysis is then undertaken on the qualitative interview data from which new knowledge on consumer perceptions of <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> is identified. Analysis of the empirical data suggests that UK consumers have significant technology and security concerns which negatively affect consumer interest. Despite these concerns, UK consumers demonstrate interest in the <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> phenomenon when perceived usefulness benefits are identified. The perceived usefulness positively influences attitude that overcomes perceived risks which can lead to amended consumer payment behaviour and widespread adoption. In addition, UK consumers have a significant lack of trust towards unknown organisations as well as new market entrants although there is an increased level of trust in <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> provided by UK banks as well as other established organisations. This research fills an important gap in existing literature on consumer payment behaviour as it explores UK consumer cultural perceptions of the <b>mobile</b> <b>payments</b> phenomenon using smart phones and contactless consumer devices; whereas earlier consumer payment research is based upon a mobile phone handset that does not have the technology capabilities of today’s smart phones and has an Asian and Nordic cultural focus. Furthermore, this research provides UK empirical evidence that refines and extends existing research through the use of sequential mixed methods whilst adding to the understanding of UK consumer attitudes related to UK payment instruments...|$|R
