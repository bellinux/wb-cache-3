5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{is a type}} of <b>metallurgical</b> furnace used for {{smelting}} to produce industrial metals and its alloys, generally iron, but also others such as lead or copper.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers assumed {{control of}} the nuclear weapons program and Compton's <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory {{became part of the}} Manhattan Project. That month, Compton gave Robert Oppenheimer {{responsibility}} for bomb design. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs that the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory scientists had devised should be pursued, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built.|$|E

5|$|The United States Army Corps of Engineers assumed {{control of}} the nuclear weapons program in June 1942, and Compton's <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory became part of {{what came to be}} called the Manhattan Project. Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. became {{director}} of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942. He visited the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory {{for the first time on}} 5 October. Between 15 September and 15 November 1942, groups under Herbert Anderson and Walter Zinn constructed 16 experimental piles under the Stagg Field stands.|$|E
5|$|Where possible, the University of Chicago {{attempted}} to re-employ workers {{who had been}} transferred from the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory to other projects once their work had ended. Replacing staff was nearly impossible, as Groves had ordered a staffing freeze. The only division to grow between November 1944 and March 1945 was the health division; all the rest lost 20 {{percent or more of}} their staff. From a peak of 2,008 staff on 1 July 1944, the number of people working at the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory fell to 1,444 on 1 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Chicago, which awarded him his doctorate in mathematical biophysics in 1939, Weinberg joined the Manhattan Project's <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory in September 1941. The following year he became part of Eugene Wigner's Theoretical Group, whose task was to design the nuclear reactors that would convert uranium into plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Arc {{discharge}}: {{this is a}} {{high power}} thermal discharge of very high temperature (≈10,000 K). It can be generated using various power supplies. It is commonly used in <b>metallurgical</b> processes. For example, {{it is used to}} smelt minerals containing Al2O3 to produce aluminium.|$|E
5|$|As the {{reactors}} at Hanford came online, the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory turned its {{attention back to}} theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but the challenge was met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also intrigued {{by the possibility of}} doing away with much of the complexities of a reactor by having the uranium in solution or a slurry in heavy water. The <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory attempted to find a way of doing this.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the work}} on reactor development, the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory studied the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of plutonium, and worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about {{the health and safety}} aspects, and the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous. The <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory became the first of the national laboratories, the Argonne National Laboratory, on 1 July 1946.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1942, {{along with}} uranium {{production}} operations, the Ames Project conducted {{a variety of}} <b>metallurgical</b> research related to the separation and purification of thorium, beryllium and rare-earth metals, such as cerium.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{was born}} on 19 December 1906 in Kamenskoye, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire (now Kamianske, Ukraine), to {{metalworker}} Ilya Yakovlevich Brezhnev and his wife, Natalia Denisovna Mazalova. His parents {{used to live in}} Brezhnevo (Kursky District, Kursk Oblast, Russia) before moving to Kamenskoe. Brezhnev's ethnicity was specified as Ukrainian in some documents, including his passport, and Russian in others. Like many youths in the years after the Russian Revolution of 1917, he received a technical education, at first in land management where he started as a land surveyor and then in metallurgy. He graduated from the Dniprodzerzhynsk <b>Metallurgical</b> Technicum in 1935 and became a <b>metallurgical</b> engineer in the iron and steel industries of eastern Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|Curium was {{chemically}} identified at the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory (now Argonne National Laboratory) at the University of Chicago. It was {{the third}} transuranium element to be discovered {{even though it is}} the fourth in the series – the lighter element americium was unknown at the time.|$|E
5|$|Despite these modifications, B of the Bang {{remained}} fenced off, prompting a {{local newspaper}} campaign to 'Get It Sorted'. In May 2006 a total of nine spikes {{were removed from the}} sculpture and taken away for <b>metallurgical</b> analysis, to discover the stresses being placed on the steel.|$|E
5|$|During 1943 and 1944, the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory {{focused on}} first getting the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works up and running, {{and then the}} B Reactor at the Hanford Site. By the end of 1944, the focus had {{switched}} to training operators. Much of the chemistry division moved to Oak Ridge in October 1943, and many personnel were transferred to other Manhattan Project sites in 1944, particularly Hanford and Los Alamos. Fermi became a division head at Los Alamos in September 1944, and Zinn became {{the director of the}} Argonne Laboratory. Allison followed in November 1944, taking with him many of the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory's staff, including most of the instrument section. He was replaced by Joyce C. Stearns. Farrington Daniels, who became associate director on 1 September 1944, succeeded Stearns as director on 1 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Compton was a {{key figure}} in the Manhattan Project that {{developed}} the first nuclear weapons. His reports were important in launching the project. In 1942, he became head of the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory, with responsibility for producing nuclear reactors to convert uranium into plutonium, finding ways to separate the plutonium from the uranium and to design an atomic bomb. Compton oversaw Enrico Fermi's creation of Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear reactor, which went critical on December 2, 1942. The <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory was also responsible for the design and operation of the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Plutonium began being produced in the Hanford Site reactors in 1945.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Smyth was {{involved}} in helping the United States build the atomic bomb. From 1941–43 {{he was a member}} of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC)'s Uranium Committee charged with producing fissile material for the bomb. Smyth proposed the electromagnetic methods that were used to enrich the first large U-235 samples for the project. He also oversaw a nuclear fission-related project for the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). During 1943–45 he was a consultant to the Manhattan Project, which built and tested the weapon, and associate director of the University of Chicago's <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory, which contributed to the Manhattan Project. At the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory he headed research on heavy water. He remained chairman of Princeton's physics department throughout the war, and the attendant obligations forced him to participate less actively in the project's later stages.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, Allison {{joined the}} S-1 Section, which coordinated the early {{investigations}} into the feasibility of an atomic bomb. He began building a reactor in the squash courts under the disused stands of Stagg Field. He became head of the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory's chemistry section in January 1942, and in March, his small experimental reactor using beryllium came closer to criticality than the graphite-moderated design of Enrico Fermi's group at Columbia University. During 1942, Compton brought all the research groups working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design at Columbia University, Princeton University and the University of California together at the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory in Chicago. Allison was placed {{in charge of the}} experimental work.|$|E
5|$|Norman Hilberry was {{associate}} director of the <b>Metallurgical</b> Project, and Richard L. Doan was appointed the Director of the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory. While Doan was an able administrator, he had difficulty being accepted {{as the head of the}} laboratory, since he was not an academic. On 5 May 1943, Compton replaced him with Samuel K. Allison, and appointed Henry D. Smyth as {{associate director}}. Initially there were three physics groups, headed by Allison, Fermi and Martin D. Whitaker. Frank Spedding was in charge of the Chemistry Division. He was later succeeded by Herbert McCoy, and then by James Franck. Compton placed Robert Oppenheimer in charge of the bomb design effort in June 1942. In November 1942, this became a separate project, known as Project Y, which was located in Los Alamos, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} months, some 175 technical personnel were {{transferred from the}} <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory to Hanford and Los Alamos. Zinn's Argonne Laboratory {{was reduced to a}} skeleton staff, but Compton would not countenance its closure.|$|E
5|$|The initial <b>metallurgical</b> {{analysis}} of the hoard {{was carried out in}} late 1992 and early 1993 by Cowell and Hook for the procedural purposes of the coroner's inquest. This analysis used X-ray fluorescence, a technique that was applied again later to cleaned surfaces on specimens.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of Carnegie Tech, Morrison {{became interested in}} physics, which he studied at the University of California, Berkeley, {{under the supervision of}} J. Robert Oppenheimer. He also joined the Communist Party. During World War II he joined the Manhattan Project's <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory at the University of Chicago, where he worked with Eugene Wigner on the design of nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|A {{subcommittee}} of the S-1 Executive Committee, chaired by James B. Conant, and consisting of himself, Arthur Compton and Harold Urey, was appointed {{to look into the}} issue, and it similarly assessed the danger as low, but still sufficient to warrant taking some precautions. A program was initiated by the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory in Chicago and the Victoreen Instrument Company in Cleveland to develop radiation detection devices suitable for use in the field. Some 48 portable detection meters were built in 1943, half of which were capable of detecting 0 to 10 roentgens per day, while the other half could detect from 0 to 100 roentgens per day. Instruments sets were stored at Manhattan District offices in Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and the area engineer and some other officers were instructed in their use. A special team of scientists was created at the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory who could respond to any reports of the use of nuclear weapons or radioactive poisons.|$|E
5|$|After he {{finished}} his Ph.D. Morrison took a position as an instructor at San Francisco State College. In 1941 he became an instructor at the University of Illinois. In December 1942, with World War II raging around the globe, he was recruited by Robert F. Christy to join the Manhattan Project's <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory at the University of Chicago in January 1943. There he worked with Eugene Wigner {{on the design of}} nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Army, Bachelder became a {{research}} chemist at the University of Chicago, {{where the first}} self-sustaining nuclear reaction had been achieved in 1942. Nobel Laureate James Franck had been Director of the Chemistry Division of the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory during the earlier phases of the Manhattan Project. Bachelder joined the University's Institute for the Study of Metals (renamed as the James Franck Institute in 1967), and she conducted further research in metallochemistry.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{bombing of}} Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the Pacific War, Agnew {{and his girlfriend}} Beverly, a fellow {{graduate}} of South Denver High School and the University of Denver, attempted to join the United States Army Air Corps together. They were persuaded not to sign the enlistment papers. Instead, Joyce C. Stearns, {{the head of the}} physics department at the University of Denver, persuaded Agnew to come with him to the University of Chicago, where Stearns became the deputy head of the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory. Although Agnew had enough credits to graduate, Beverly did not and had to remain behind. They were married in Denver on May 2, 1942. They then went to Chicago, where Beverly became a secretary to Richard L. Doan, then head of the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory. Agnew and Beverly had two children, a daughter Nancy, and a son, John.|$|E
5|$|Agnew {{joined the}} <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory at the University of Chicago in 1942, and {{helped build the}} Chicago Pile-1, the world's first nuclear reactor. In 1943, he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory, where he worked with the Cockcroft–Walton generator. After the war ended, he {{returned}} to the University of Chicago, where he completed his graduate work under Enrico Fermi.|$|E
5|$|Alvin Cushman Graves (November 4, 1909 – July 19, 1965) was an American nuclear {{physicist}} {{who served}} at the Manhattan Project's <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory and the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. After the war, he became the head of J (Test) Division at Los Alamos, and was director or assistant director of numerous nuclear weapons tests during the 1940s and 1950s. Graves was badly injured in the 1946 laboratory criticality accident in Los Alamos that killed Louis Slotin, but recovered.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth has few {{commercial}} applications, {{and those}} applications that use it generally require small quantities {{relative to other}} raw materials. In the United States, for example, 884 tonnes of bismuth were consumed in 2010, of which 63% went into chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, pigments, and cosmetics); 26% into <b>metallurgical</b> additives for casting and galvanizing; 7% into bismuth alloys, solders and ammunition; and 4% into research and other uses.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Allison became {{involved}} in defence-related work. He was {{a consultant to the}} National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) from October 1940 to January 1941. In January 1941 the NDRC let him a contract to study the possibility of using beryllium as a neutron moderator. The team he assembled in Chicago would grow into the Manhattan Project's <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Foreseeing {{another war}} in Europe, Szilard {{moved to the}} United States in 1938, where he worked with Enrico Fermi and Walter Zinn on means of {{creating}} a nuclear chain reaction. He was present when this was achieved on December 2, 1942. He worked for the Manhattan Project's <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory on aspects of nuclear reactor design. He drafted the Szilard petition advocating {{a demonstration of the}} atomic bomb, but the Interim Committee chose to use them against cities without warning.|$|E
5|$|Franck {{participated in}} the Manhattan Project during World War II as Director of the Chemistry Division of the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory. He was also the {{chairman}} of the Committee on Political and Social Problems regarding the atomic bomb, which is best known for the compilation of the Franck Report, which recommended that the atomic bombs not be used on the Japanese cities without warning.|$|E
5|$|Hoylande Denune Young Failey (June 26, 1903 – January 12, 1986) was an American chemist. During World War II {{she worked}} at the Manhattan Project's <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory. After the war {{she became the first}} woman to be {{appointed}} as a division head at the Argonne National Laboratory, and the first woman to chair the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen {{is highly}} soluble in many rare earth and {{transition}} metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals {{is influenced by}} local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice. These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks, but the gas's high solubility is a <b>metallurgical</b> problem, contributing to the embrittlement of many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|If the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of uranium was poorly understood, that of plutonium was practically unknown, {{as it had}} only existed in microscopic amounts. Samples began arriving from the reactors in 1943, and although the locus of the Manhattan Project's investigations into plutonium chemistry was at the <b>Metallurgical</b> Laboratory, the Ames Project investigated methods of separating plutonium metal from uranium and fission products.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Friedman {{accepted}} {{a position at}} the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but left because of differences with faculty regarding United States involvement in World War II. Friedman believed the United States should enter the war. In 1943, Friedman joined the Division of War Research at Columbia University (headed by W. Allen Wallis and Harold Hotelling), where he {{spent the rest of}} World War II working as a mathematical statistician, focusing on problems of weapons design, military tactics, and <b>metallurgical</b> experiments.|$|E
