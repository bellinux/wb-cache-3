40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the control problem of a robot {{manipulator}} for a class of constrained motions in an unknown environment. To accomplish a task in the presence of uncertainties, we propose a new guidance and control strategy based on <b>multisensor</b> <b>fusion.</b> Three different sensors-robot joint encoders, a wrist force-torque sensor and a vision system-are utilized for our task. First of all, a sensor-based hybrid position/force control scheme is proposed for an unknown contact surface. Secondly, a new <b>multisensor</b> <b>fusion</b> scheme is utilized to handle an uncalibrated workcell, wherein the surface on which there is a path to be followed by a robot is assumed to be unknown but visible by the vision system and the precise position and orientation of camera(s) with respect to the base frame of the robot is also assumed to be unknown. Our work is related with areas such as visual servoing, <b>multisensor</b> <b>fusion</b> and robot control for constrained motion. The main features of the proposed approach are: (i) multi-sensor fusion is used both for two disparate sensors (i. e. force-torque and visual sensors) and for complementary observed data rather than redundant ones as in traditional way; (ii) visual servoing is realized on the tangent space of the unknown surface; (iii) calibration of the camera with respect to the robot is not needed.

40|$|Data {{provided}} by sensors is always subjected to {{some level of}} uncertainty and inconsistency. <b>Multisensor</b> data <b>fusion</b> algorithms reduce the uncertainty by combining data from several sources. However, if these several sources provide inconsistent data, catastrophic fusion may occur where the performance of <b>multisensor</b> data <b>fusion</b> is {{significantly lower than the}} performance of each of the individual sensor. This paper presents an approach to <b>multisensor</b> data <b>fusion</b> in order to decrease data uncertainty with ability to identify and handle inconsistency. The proposed approach relies on combining a modified Bayesian fusion algorithm with Kalman filtering. Three different approaches, namely, prefiltering, postfiltering and pre-postfiltering are described based on how filtering is applied to the sensor data, to the fused data or both. A case study to find the position of a mobile robot by estimating its x and y coordinates using four sensors is presented. The simulations show that combining fusion with filtering helps in handling the problem of uncertainty and inconsistency of the data...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>multisensor</b> <b>fusion</b> framework for video activities recognition based on statistical reasoning and D-S evidence theory. Precisely, the framework consists in {{the combination of}} the events ’ uncertainty computation with the trained database and the fusion method based on the conflict management of evidences. Our framework aims to build <b>Multisensor</b> <b>fusion</b> architecture for event recognition by combining sensors, dealing with conflicting recognition, and improving their performance. According to a complex event’s hierarchy, Primitive state is chosen as our target event in the framework. A RGB camera and a RGB-D camera are used to recognise a person’s basic activities in the scene. The main convenience of the proposed framework is that it firstly allows adding easily more possible events into the system with a complete structure for handling uncertainty. And secondly, the inference of Dempster-Shafer theory resembles human perception and fits for uncertainty and conflict management with incomplete information. The cross-validation of real-world data (10 persons) is carried out using the proposed framework, and the evaluation shows promising results that the fusion approach has an average sensitivity of 93. 31 % and an average precision of 86. 7 %. These results are better than the ones when only one camera is used, encouraging further research focusing on the combination of more sensors with more events, as well as the optimization of the parameters in the framework for improvements.

In the past, in the <b>multisensor</b> <b>fusion</b> community, the research goal has been primarily focused on establishing a computational approach for fusion processing and algorithms.

Pyroelectric {{infrared}} (PIR) sensors {{can detect}} {{the presence of}} human without the need to carry any device, which are widely used for human presence detection in home/office automation systems {{in order to improve}} energy efficiency.

40|$|This thesis proposes {{an entropy}} based Markov chain (EMC) fusion {{technique}} and demon-strates its applications in <b>multisensor</b> <b>fusion.</b> <b>Multisensor</b> <b>fusion</b> {{is a science}} in studying the methods for combining multiple sensory observations into a consensus output such that classification and estimation accuracy can be improved by reducing the measurement uncertainty. The consensus output can be either (a) one of the possible classes for the classification problem, or (b) a random variable for the parameter estimation problem. In recent years, {{a great deal of}} interests in <b>multisensor</b> <b>fusion</b> has been aroused in the fields of robotics, computer vision, remote sensing and medical imaging because of the general belief that multiple observations can help lower the uncertainty level, which can hardly be achieved by any individual observation. Therefore, a number of context dependent <b>multisensor</b> <b>fusion</b> techniques have been proposed recently. The most widely used measure of uncertainty, which is expressed in terms of the probabilistic function, is Shannon's entropy. It was originally employed in the measurement of randomness which in turn can be interpreted as the measurement of uncertainty. Self-emropy and conditional entropy, which measure how uncertain a sensor is about its own observation and joint observations respectively, are adopted. Markov chain has been used as an observation combination process because of two major reasons: (a) the consensus output is a linear combination of the weighted local observations which greatly simplifies the observation combination process; and (b) the weight is the transition probability assigned by one sensor to another sensor and can be intuitively related to the single observation distribution and the joint observation distribution between two sensors. Higher order distributions are not necessary. Because of these reasons, the Markov chain is employed. Experiments have been done to implement the entropy based Markov chain (EMC) fusion technique. The results show that the proposed approach can reduce the measurement uncertainty by aggregating multiple observations. The major benefits of this approach are as follows: (a) single observation distributions and joint observation distributions between any two sensors, which represent the interrelations between the sensory observations and the consensus output, can be represented in polynomial form, (b) the consensus output is the linear combination of the weighted observations, in which weights can be computed in polynomial time and (c) EMC is robust because it suppresses the noisy observation with high uncertainty level to minimize the contribution of the noisy and unreliable observations in the combination process...|$|E
