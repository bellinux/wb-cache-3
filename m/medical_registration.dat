25|$|In modern Australia, general {{practice}} is listed by the AMC {{as a medical}} specialty and the RACGP as the specialist college responsible for assessment, as endorsed by the Medical Board of Australia inaugurated in 2010. Yet, on further examination of how {{general practice}} is considered across the nation, some of the now-defunct state-based Medical Practitioners’ Boards such as Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, did not consider general practice a medical specialty and general practice qualifications, such as the Fellowship of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (FRACGP) were not registerable qualifications.

30|$|Point features, as {{the basis}} of lines, surfaces, and bodies, are {{commonly}} used in <b>medical</b> image <b>registration.</b> To obtain an elegant spatial transformation of extracted feature points, many point set matching algorithms (PMs) have been developed to match two point sets by optimizing multifarious distance functions. There are ample reviews related to <b>medical</b> image <b>registration</b> and PMs which summarize their basic principles and main algorithms separately. However, to data, detailed summary of PMs used in <b>medical</b> image <b>registration</b> in different clinical environments has not been published. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing key techniques of the PMs applied to <b>medical</b> image <b>registration</b> according to the basic principles and clinical applications. As the core technique of the PMs, geometric transformation models are elaborated in this paper, demonstrating the mechanism of point set registration. We also focus on the clinical applications of the PMs and propose a practical classification method according to their applications in different clinical surgeries. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a summary of point-feature-based methods used in <b>medical</b> image <b>registration</b> and to guide doctors or researchers interested in this field to choose appropriate techniques in their research.|$|R
30|$|<b>Medical</b> image <b>registration,</b> i.e., {{aligning}} two medical images {{by finding}} an optimistic spatial transformation, plays {{a very important}} role in image-guided surgery and disease diagnosis. This alignment means that the same anatomical structures on two matching images correspond with each other spatially. One of the two purposes of <b>medical</b> image <b>registration</b> is to synthesize the associated information contained in multiple modality images, and the other is to comprehend images obtained from the same instrument at different times and positions. According {{to the nature of the}} registration bases, registration methods can be classified into two categories: extrinsic and intrinsic. The registration bases of extrinsic registration methods are often features attached to patients or clinical instruments. Markers, frameworks and artificial implantations are widely used bases in extrinsic <b>medical</b> image <b>registration.</b> Intrinsic <b>medical</b> image <b>registration</b> considers the information containing in the images as bases, such as the centerline of vessels and the outline of bones. Intrinsic <b>medical</b> image <b>registration</b> methods usually fall into two categories: intensity-based methods and feature-based methods [1]. Intensity-based approaches employ difference measurements based on the pixel intensities, while feature-based methods use distance-based measures of the features extracted from the input images to be aligned. Feature-based algorithms are widely employed because of their briefness, simplicity and low computational complexity over intensity-based methods. More importantly, multimodal registration using computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MR), positron emission tomography (PET), X-ray and other modality medical imaging methods is the main task of <b>medical</b> image <b>registration.</b> The intensity differences among the multimodal images vary considerably due to the different imaging principles, which prohibit the development of intensity-based registration methods. Feature similarities among the multimodal images are more explicit than the intensity differences, and as a result that feature-based methods play an important role in <b>medical</b> image <b>registration</b> [2].|$|R

40|$|<b>Medical</b> image <b>registration</b> has {{received}} considerable attention in medical imaging and computer vision, {{because of the}} large variety of ways in which it can impact patient care. Over the years, many algorithms have been proposed for <b>medical</b> image <b>registration.</b> <b>Medical</b> image <b>registration</b> uses techniques to create images of parts of the human body for clinical purposes. This thesis focuses on one small subset of registration algorithms: using machine learning techniques to train the similarity measure for use in <b>medical</b> image <b>registration.</b> This thesis is organized in the following manner. In Chapter 1 we introduce the idea of image registration, describe some some applications in medical imaging, and mathematically formulate the three main components of any registration problem: geometric transformation, similarity measure and optimization procedure. Finally we describe how the ideas in this thesis t into the eld of <b>medical</b> image <b>registration,</b> and we describe some related work. In Chapter 2 we introduce the concept of machine learning and we provide examples to illustrate machine learning algorithms. We then describe the knn-nearest neighbors algorithm and the relationship between Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance. Next we introduce distance metric learning and present two approaches for learning the Mahalanobis distance. Finally we provide a description and visual comparison of two algorithms for distance metric learning. In Chapter 3 we describe how distance metric learning {{can be applied to the}} problem of <b>medical</b> image <b>registration.</b> Our goal is to learn the optimal similarity measure given a training dataset of correctly registered images. To assess the performance of the two distance metric learning algorithms we test them using images from a series of patients. Moreover we illustrate the sensitivity of one of the learning algorithms by examining the variability of the resulting target registration errors. Finally we present our experimental results of registering CT and MR images. Finally in Chapter 4 we suggest some ideas for future work in order to improve our registration results and to speed up the algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A major {{drawback}} of <b>medical</b> image <b>registration</b> techniques is {{the performance}} bottleneck associated with similarity computation. Such bottlenecks limit registration applications {{in situations where}} fast execution times are required. In this paper a novel framework for high performance intensity-based <b>medical</b> image <b>registration</b> is presented. Geometric alignment of both reference and sensed images is achieved {{through a combination of}} scaling, translation, and rotation. Crucially, similarity computation is performed intelligently by knowledge sources (KSs) organised in a worker/manager model. The KSs work in parallel and communicate with each other by means of a distributed blackboard architecture. Partitioning of the blackboard is used to balance communication and processing workloads. The registration framework presented demonstrates the flexibility of the coarse-grained parallelism employed and shows how high performance <b>medical</b> image <b>registration</b> can be achieved with non-specialised architectures.
