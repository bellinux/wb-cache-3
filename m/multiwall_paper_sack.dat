40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the feasibility of replacing a corrugated container with a <b>multiwall</b> <b>paper</b> bag for the packaging of food wraps used in the 2 ̆ 2 Quick - Serve 2 ̆ 2 foodservice industry. The study was limited to one specific restaurant chain and for only one size of food wraps. Laboratory testing was used to compare the performance attributes of both package systems. This study will provide a model for quantifying package source reduction when comparing a rigid package design to a flexible one. The results show that, indeed, a <b>multiwall</b> <b>paper</b> bag is a feasible alternative to a corrugated container when packaging food wraps and that significant source reduction can be realized from this change. Immediate and significant cost savings will also be achieved if the alternate package system is used for this foodservice application...|$|R

50|$|The {{foundation}} of Schauman's paper-and-pulp operations was laid {{with the construction}} of a sulfite pulp mill in Jakobstad in 1934. In the early 1960s, a sulfate pulp mill, a paper mill, and a <b>paper</b> <b>sack</b> plant were added. During {{the first half of the}} 1970s, major investments were made in pulp manufacturing, and this made Schauman the largest producer of market pulp in Finland. The <b>paper</b> <b>sack</b> plant in Jakobstad soon became the largest of its kind in Finland, and in 1969 Schauman purchased the Craf'Sac plant in Rouen, France. Schauman had already become a world leader in plywood product development by the beginning of the 1960s, grabbing additional market share through the use of new and innovative production methods for gluing, coating and processing of plywood, as well as through the use of spruce as raw material.|$|R
50|$|Wood pulp for <b>sack</b> <b>paper</b> is {{made from}} {{softwood}} by the kraft process. The long fibers provides the paper its strength and is added wet strength chemicals to even further improve the strength. Both white and brown grades are made. <b>Sack</b> <b>paper</b> is then produced on a paper machine from the wood pulp. The paper is microcrepped to give porosity and elasticity. Microcrepping is done by drying with loose draws allowing it to shrink. This is causing the paper to elongate 4% in machine direction and 10% in cross direction before busting. Machine direction elongation can be further improved by pressing between very elastic cylinders causing more microcrepping. The paper may be coated with polyethylene (PE) to ensure an effective barrier against moisture, grease and bacteria. A <b>paper</b> <b>sack</b> can be made of several layers of <b>sack</b> <b>paper</b> depending on the toughness needed.|$|R
50|$|Changes in {{packaging}} after World War II sparked {{changes within}} the company. Products such as <b>multiwall</b> <b>paper</b> bags, canvas goods, osnaburgs, and barrier materials replaced {{some of the}} old products, to respond to the new market opportunities presented in the postwar era. In 1956, Eastern and Midwestern investors bought controlling interest in the company, the nine bag manufacturing companies were sold, and in 1960 the parent company became Fulton Industries Inc. The Atlanta mill, which remained known as Fulton Cotton Mill, continued in operation under the management of Elsas family members until 1968. In that year Fulton Industries Inc. was sold to Allied Products Corp.. Fulton Cotton Mill's last president, Meno Schoenbach, served in that position from 1971 until 1978, the year the Atlanta mill finally closed its doors.|$|R

50|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>sacks</b> {{are usually}} made of Kraft paper having the {{advantage}} of being soft and strong at the same time. The stretch or elongation increases the energy required to break the material. They easily carry and protect products up to 50 kg, and adapt easily to the nature of their contents and to handling constraints. At the same time sacks are provide an excellent media for promotional messages and sophisticated printing designs.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>paper</b> <b>sack</b> is a {{packaging}} made {{of paper}} high quality and weight, usually kraft virgin fiber, which is normally used for transporting powder materials, such as flour, cement, animal feed, etc. Multi-wall paper bags usually have {{several layers of}} heavy duty kraft paper, sometimes with a highly printed paper on the outside. Plastic films and coated papers are sometimes used as inner layers to provide a moisture barrier, and resistance to rodents and insects.|$|R

40|$|Still the {{metering}} of glue in {{a machine}} of bottom glueing of <b>paper</b> <b>sacks</b> is a technical problem not yet solved satisfactory. The usually applied manual control of glue metering by the operators {{often results in}} an overdosing. This leads {{to a loss of}} mechanical strength and microbial stability of the sacks, caused by high humidity. An automatic control of glue metering can only be achived, when appropriate, i. e. powerful and cost efficient sensors are available. One of the measuring principles which are adaptable to the measurement of glue application is microwave absorption measurement. Industrial microwave sensors already on the market, are far too expensive for the use in machines for the bottom glueing of <b>paper</b> <b>sacks</b> where up to 16 positions are to be equipped with a measurement system. For {{the last couple of years}} cheap microwave sources and detectors for the use in mass products have been available. With these components it should be possible to construct a sensor at very low cost s. Therefore the suitability of these microwave components for the measurement of glue application has been investigated and a sensor prototype for online measurement in a machine of bottom glueing has been developed...|$|R
50|$|Starch {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of various adhesives or glues for book-binding, wallpaper adhesives, <b>paper</b> <b>sack</b> production, tube winding, gummed paper, envelope adhesives, school glues and bottle labeling. Starch derivatives, such as yellow dextrins, can be modified by addition of some chemicals to form a hard glue for paper work; some of those forms use borax or soda ash, which are mixed with the starch solution at 50 - 70 C to create a very good adhesive. Sodium silicate can be added to reinforce these formula.|$|R

40|$|For an {{adequate}} conservation of seeds {{it is essential}} previously establishing the ideal conditions for their storage. Thereby, this study aimed at evaluating influence of packaging types and storage environmental conditions on physiological quality of fennel seeds. The seeds were stored into three different packaging types (cotton bags, <b>multiwall</b> <b>paper</b> bags, and glass containers), and stored under two environmental conditions (laboratory and cold chamber) during a twelve months period. Physiological seed quality was assessed before storage and at every two months after storage through tests of germination, germination speed index, and electrical conductivity. Experiment was performed on a completely randomized design with treatments arranged in a split-split plot arrangement in time (two environmental storage conditions x three packaging types x six storage periods + a control treatment), with four replications. Fennel seeds packaged into glass containers have maintained their physiological quality stable over the twelve storage months regardless storage environmental conditions; being considered the best container for storing fennel seeds; and cotton packaging was considered as the least efficient for both storage under laboratory environmental conditions {{as well as for}} storage under cold chamber conditions...|$|R
