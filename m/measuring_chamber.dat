2500|$|Open mode systems, are {{designed}} to find soil flux rates when <b>measuring</b> <b>chamber</b> equilibrium has been reached. Air flows through the chamber before the chamber is closed and sealed. This purges any non-ambient CO2 levels from the chamber before measurement. After the chamber is closed, fresh air is pumped into the chamber at a controlled and programmable flow rate. This mixes with the CO2 from the soil, and after a time, equilibrium is reached. The researcher specifies the equilibrium point as the difference in CO2 measurements between successive readings, in an elapsed time. During the assay, {{the rate of change}} slowly reduces until it meets the customer's rate of change criteria, or the maximum selected time for the assay. [...] Soil flux or rate of change is then determined once equilibrium conditions are reached within the chamber. Chamber flow rates and times are programmable, accurately measured, and used in calculations. These systems have vents that {{are designed}} to prevent a possible unacceptable buildup of partial CO2 pressure discussed under closed mode systems. Since the air movement inside the chamber might cause increased chamber pressure, or external winds may produce reduced chamber pressure, a vent is provided that is designed to be as wind proof as possible.|$|E

5000|$|A barge to {{be weighed}} {{was brought into}} a {{supporting}} cradle connected by levers to a weighing mechanism. The water was then drained and the scale balance adjusted to determine the barge gross weight. Subtracting the tare weight ({{the weight of the}} barge when empty) would give the cargo weight. Originally weighlocks measured the weight of the barge, initially by measuring the displacement of water from the lock by collecting the liquid in a separate <b>measuring</b> <b>chamber</b> after the barge had entered.

5000|$|Through the mid-1960s, {{the most}} common way of {{measuring}} pressure was drilling a hole through the chamber of the barrel and inserting a copper slug that fit flush with the chamber walls.

40|$|Evapotranspiration (ET) is the {{combination}} of soil water evaporation and plant transpiration. ET is a vital component of a field water balance; however, accurate determination of ET is difficult. Indirect methods and direct methods are used to measure ET at the field scale. Typical indirect methods estimate ET with energy balance or field water balance measurement. One possible direct method for determining ET {{involves the use of}} canopy chambers. The objectives of this study are to construct a portable canopy chamber; to quantify the diurnal and seasonal trends of ET in three cropping systems; and to compare reference evaporation (Priestley-Taylor method), ET estimated from field water balance components (i. e., rainfall, soil water storage and drainage), and portable canopy <b>chamber</b> <b>measured</b> ET. Three cropping systems, including corn and soybean in a corn-soybean rotation and reconstructed prairie, were studied at the Comparison of Bio-fuel Systems (COBS) research site in central Iowa. Portable canopy chambers were used to measure ET in the different cropping systems during the part of growing season in 2013, and the whole growing season in 2014. Three different chamber sizes were used to match different crop growth stages. Data were collected on 18 days (i. e., maximum ET flux measurements, average ET flux measurements, and diurnal measurements) during the part of 2013 crop growing season and 15 days (diurnal measurements) during the 2014 crop growing season. In 2013 (DOY 164 - 206 for corn and DOY 164 - 255 for prairie and soybean) the cumulative <b>chamber</b> <b>measured</b> ET values were {{less than half of the}} reference evaporation values, due to relatively dry soil conditions.
