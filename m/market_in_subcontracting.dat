However, all subcontractors might not possess the required proficiency to fulfil client’s necessities.

The study incorporated interviews and questionnaire survey to derive at the aim of this research which was to identifying the caused for disputes <b>in</b> <b>subcontracts</b> <b>in</b> the construction industry in Sri Lanka and propose mitigation measures. Besides, to understand the practice of <b>subcontracting</b> <b>in</b> construction industry and caused for possible disputes, a literature synthesis followed by questionnaire survey and structured interviews were executed. Similarly, literature synthesis assisted to identify causes for disputes <b>in</b> <b>subcontracts.</b> Furthermore, preliminary investigation aided in validating the findings of the literature synthesis while more issues and solutions were added by the interviewees. Consequently issues and solutions were ranked through the questionnaire survey to identify the most critical issue. Subsequently the mitigation measures were proposed to overcome the disputes <b>in</b> <b>subcontracts</b> with the aid of the findings of literature synthesis, interview and questionnaire survey. Payment problems, coordination problems, lack of communication, quality issues, scheduling conflicts, no form of subcontract prepared for Sri Lankan usage; no compulsory subcontractor registration procedure; no practice of security of payment in Sri Lanka are major issues.

Exclusive agreements are often reciprocal, and are typically passed on. Downstream firms are more likely to face and use vertical restraints.

40|$|Achievement of {{high quality}} {{performance}} can provide a potential competitive edge in the construction industry. Subcontracting is {{a feature of the}} construction industry that has been identified as a source of poor quality and overall poor business performance. This thesis aims to determine the root causes of poor quality performance <b>in</b> the <b>subcontracting</b> system. Supply Chain Quality Management (SCQM) by integrating Quality Management into the Construction Supply Chain will be considered for its effectiveness to overcome quality problems. A set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will also be developed as a major contribution to the thesis. KPIs, as a quality management tool, can ensure that SCQM can be effectively implemented <b>in</b> <b>subcontracted</b> projects. A questionnaire survey was adopted as the research method. It received a total of 53 valid responses from 150 of the larger main contracting companies in Australia. The mean score value analysis and Relative Importance Index was used for data analysis and the data was then processed by Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS). The findings from this research demonstrate that the factors attributed to poor quality performance are mostly soft factors, which could be properly addressed by the concepts of SCQM. From the survey, though the level of awareness of SCQM is not very high in the Australian construction industry, the willingness to accept some approaches related to this concept is high. This provides a possible foundation to implement SCQM in the construction industry. Lastly, a model of KPIs had been developed, based on the result from the previous theoretical studies and this survey, which will encourage the implementation of SCQM <b>in</b> <b>subcontracted</b> projects. It is expected that it will help construction companies achieve a better quality performance, especially <b>in</b> their <b>subcontracted</b> projects. Although the relationship between enhancement of quality and SCQM is not examined directly in this thesis, it does provide a perspective that SCQM could address poor quality performance caused by subcontracting...|$|R

Empirical tests carried out on French data confirm that firms that subcontract outsource execution tasks and that the hierarchy of firms impacts employees' wage levels...|$|R

30|$|The {{results of}} the quartiles {{specification}} broadly support these findings. The last three columns in Table  7 show that subcontracting has no effect in the bottom two quartiles and has a strong and significant effect in the most modern quartile, where total employment and hired workers increase by 3.7 percent for a 10 percent increase <b>in</b> <b>subcontracting.</b> <b>In</b> the third quartile, {{there is a large}} positive effect on hired work and the wage bill, while the effect on total employment is much weaker and not statistically significant. In all, our results show that in state-industries with a relatively modern informal sector, growth of formal sector subcontracting is associated with informal sector employment growth. The effect on total employment is similar to the effect on the number of hired workers, which suggests that both the increase in the same proportion and the expansion entails job creation in informal enterprises.|$|R

30|$|A second view on {{production}} linkages, {{referred to as}} the modernization view, holds that formal enterprises engage <b>in</b> <b>subcontracting</b> relationships only with modern informal enterprises. Formal enterprises pursue three complementary aims when engaging in subcontracting: first, minimizing costs so that the price of the subcontracted activity is as low as possible; second, maximizing the quality of the subcontracted product, so as not to compromise quality standards; and third, minimizing the risk of vertically disintegrating the production process, so as to ensure a timely delivery of the final product. Therefore, formal enterprises take into account not only differences in costs between in-house production and subcontracting, but also the productive and technological capacity of potential suppliers (Wattanapruttipaisan [2002]).|$|R
