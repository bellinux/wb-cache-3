5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Tourette's and no {{medication}} that works universally for all individuals without significant adverse effects. Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders. The management of the symptoms of Tourette's may include pharmacological, behavioral and psychological therapies. While pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, other treatments (such as supportive psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy) may help to avoid or ameliorate depression and social isolation, and to improve family support. Educating a patient, family, and surrounding community (such as friends, school, and church) is a key treatment strategy, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> that is required in mild cases.|$|E

500|$|The Duke and Duchess of York lived mainly at York Cottage, a {{relatively}} small house in Sandringham, Norfolk, where {{their way of life}} mirrored that of a comfortable middle-class family rather than royalty. George preferred a simple, almost quiet, life in marked contrast to the lively social life pursued by his father. His official biographer, Harold Nicolson, later despaired of George's time as Duke of York, writing: [...] "He <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right as a young midshipman and a wise old king, but when he was Duke of York... he did nothing at all but kill [...] animals and stick in stamps." [...] George was an avid stamp collector, which Nicolson disparaged, but George played a large role in building the Royal Philatelic Collection into the most comprehensive collection of United Kingdom and Commonwealth stamps in the world, in some cases setting record purchase prices for items.|$|E
500|$|Wilderness {{protection}} and the conservation movement, led by {{figures such as}} John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, also began to appear at this time. By {{the turn of the}} century, those in favor of recreational ideals of nature began to clash with conservationists such as Muir. Likewise, critics and natural scientists became skeptical of what they saw as a growing cult of nature, which was thought to wrongly champion sentimentality and aesthetics rather than scientific facts. Sympathy for animals and their survival also became a developing thought in the 19th century, due in part to wide acceptance of theories pertaining to organic evolution. In 1837, Charles Darwin wrote in his diary that [...] "If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, disease, death, suffering and famine—our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements—they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor—we <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> melted together." ...|$|E
