They separated in 1977, and in May 1978 she {{filed for divorce}} {{on the grounds of}} his adultery. During his marriage to De Macias, Jagger had an affair with then-Playboy model Bebe Buell from 1974 to 1976. In late 1977, Jagger began dating American model Jerry Hall; they moved in together and had a total of four children.

5|$|A Deshasthas <b>marriage</b> <b>ceremony</b> {{includes}} many {{elements of a}} traditional Marathi Hindu wedding ceremony. It consists of seemant poojan on the wedding eve. The dharmic wedding includes the antarpat ceremony followed by the vedic ceremony which involves the bridegroom and the bride walking around the sacred fire seven times to complete the marriage. Modern urban wedding ceremonies conclude with an evening reception. A Deshastha woman becomes part of her husband's family after marriage and adopts the gotra {{as well as the}} traditions of her husband's family.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the couple}} {{went through a}} <b>marriage</b> <b>ceremony</b> on 15 December 1785 at her house in Park Street, Mayfair. Legally the union was void, as the King's consent was not granted (and never even requested). However, Fitzherbert {{believed}} {{that she was the}} prince's canonical and true wife, holding the law of the Church to be superior to the law of the State. For political reasons, the union remained secret and Fitzherbert promised not to reveal it.|$|E
5|$|A {{story was}} told that Ælfric {{introduced}} monks into the cathedral church of Christ Church, Canterbury, replacing the secular clerks that {{had taken over the}} foundation during the ninth century.

This story originally dates to soon after the Norman Conquest and originated with the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear. He likely performed the <b>marriage</b> <b>ceremony</b> of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, which, if true, would have meant extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.|$|E

Louis XVIII knew that his nephew Louis Antoine was not compatible with Marie-Thérèse. Despite this, he still pressed for the marriage, which proved to be quite unhappy and produced no children.|$|E

It was not unusual for marriages to be arranged with young girls. She came from Rajendram, a village close to Marudur (Karur district) Railway Station. Ramanujan's father did not participate in the <b>marriage</b> <b>ceremony.</b> As was common at that time, Janakiammal continued to stay at her maternal home for three years after marriage till she attained puberty.

5|$|The Roce (anointing) ceremony, {{conducted}} one or {{two days}} before a wedding, celebrates the last day of virginity of the bride and bridegroom and involves the parents' blessing of the bride and groom, who are anointed with roce, a mixture of coconut milk and coconut oil, while a cross is inscribed on the bride's forehead. The marriage traditions include Soirik (betrothal), exchange of Paan Pod (betel leaves) during the <b>marriage</b> <b>ceremony,</b> which known as Badalchen (changing hands; formal acceptance of the promise made by the bride's father to the bridegroom's father that he will give his daughter in marriage). The bride is adorned with the Sado (wedding sari) and Pirduk (wedding necklace). Other rites include the Onpnni (giving away the bride formally by the father or the guardian of the bride), Porthoponn (re-invitation to the bride's house), and singing of Honvious (hymns). Some non-marriage traditions include Novemjeevon (partaking of the food prepared from new corn) and Novem (blessing of new harvests).|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} the vicar and his family heading to a picnic with Squire Thornhill, {{during the course of}} which the vicar notices Thornhill's {{interest}} in his daughter, Olivia. The vicar warns his family that Thornhill is a degenerate young man, but Olivia is seduced and elopes with Thornhill. Secretly, Thornhill arranges a fake <b>marriage</b> <b>ceremony</b> to capitalize on his sexual desires while avoiding the responsibility that would come with the union. Olivia learns the marriage was fake and that she has duped into a form of consensual prostitution with Thornhill, but escapes and returns home. Thornhill decides to take his revenge by having the vicar incarcerated for his debts. While in prison, the vicar learns that the marriage was in fact legitimate; Thornhill's uncle, Sir William, then forces his nephew to apologize to Olivia and fulfill his obligations.|$|E
5|$|The <b>marriage</b> <b>ceremony</b> was {{conducted}} {{according to the}} Catholic rite between 19 May, when Catherine arrived in Milodraž near Fojnica accompanied by her father, and 22 May 1446. The wedding was attended by a delegation from the Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik), but it failed to end all internal strife, since leading noblemen such as Ivaniš Pavlović (Catherine's first cousin, lord of eastern Bosnia) and Petar Vojsalić (lord of Donji Kraji) snubbed it. The coronation, planned {{to take place in}} Mile near Visoko immediately after the wedding, was apparently postponed. The new queen consort converted to Catholicism ("laid aside Patarin errors"), likely prior to her marriage, and was allowed by Pope Eugene to choose for herself two chaplains from among Bosnian Franciscans. The Queen's father appears to have contemplated converting too, but eventually gave up the idea and remained an adherent of the Bosnian Church until his death.|$|E

At the same time, Padayappa plans to get Anitha married to his sister's son. Neelambari, having made Chandru pretend {{to fall in love with}} Anitha, plans to humiliate Padayappa by making Anitha say that she does not wish to marry a groom of her parents' choice and that she is in love with someone else. At the <b>marriage</b> <b>ceremony,</b> after Anitha does what Neelambari told her to do, Padayappa makes an oath to unite Anitha with her lover by the next Muhurta day, or commit suicide.

When Padayappa takes Chandru and Anitha to the temple to get married, Neelambari and Suryaprakash give chase to stop them. Suryaprakash is killed in a car accident during the chase.|$|E

A sad and angry Hasini moves out of the house saying that she does not find Siddhu the same and that she cannot put on an act if she stays in their house. After getting back to her house, she rebuilds the trust her father has in her while Siddhu is left forlorn. Lakshmi confronts Aravind on Siddhu's choices and wants. In the process, Siddhu opens up his heart, leaving Aravind to repent on his over-protectiveness. Siddhu requests Subbulakshmi and her parents to call off the marriage.

The viewers are left to assume that the two lovers have a happy union.|$|E

5|$|The Aboriginal group {{forms the}} inner centre {{piece in the}} tondo of both bowls. As the same image was used for both bowls, the {{implication}} is that the Chinese ceramic painters were copying from the same drawing and finishing them at the same place and time. The image is of a group of four Aboriginal men with club, shield and spears, one woman with a baby on her shoulders – standing and turned slightly away {{from the rest of the}} figures – and another woman cowed by the men. This is thought to depict a preliminary <b>marriage</b> <b>ceremony.</b> As with the Museum bowl's Sydney Cove image, no directly related, surviving, version is known that would have been used by the ceramic artists to paint the Aboriginal group. The closest match is a drawing after an apparently now-lost original sketch by Nicolas-Martin Petit, artist on the 1800–1803 French expedition to Australia led by Nicolas Baudin. Research made around 2009–2012, indicated that during Baudin's expedition, a report was prepared for Emperor Napoleon on the feasibility of capturing the British colony at Sydney Cove. As this expedition progressed around coastal Australia, Petit began to specialise in the drawing of portraits of indigenous peoples. The French expedition arrived at Port Jackson on 25April 1802. Petit's drawing was copied for publication as plate 114 in the Voyage autour du monde : entrepris par ordre du roi (Paris, 1825) , regarding a voyage around the world (1817–1820) led by Louis-Claude de Saulces de Freycinet. The engraving is entitled Port Jackson, Nlle Hollande. Ceremonie preliminaire d'un mariage, chez les sauvages (ceremony before a marriage among the natives, Port Jackson, New Holland). Port Jackson aborigines are from the Eora group of indigenous people living in the Sydney Basin.|$|E
