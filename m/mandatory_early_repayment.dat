25|$|There {{may also}} be a special class which absorbs <b>early</b> <b>repayments</b> in the {{underlying}} assets. This is often the case where the underlying assets are mortgages which, in essence, are repaid whenever the properties are sold. Since any <b>early</b> <b>repayments</b> are passed on to this class, it means the other investors have a more predictable cash flow.|$|R
50|$|Member States should {{ensure that}} {{customers}} {{have a right}} to <b>early</b> <b>repayment.</b> A customers’ ability, to repay to mortgage prior to the expiry of the mortgage credit agreement, may {{play an important role in}} order for customers to compare different credit offers and enhances competition in the internal credit market.

50|$|Asset-backed {{securities}} and MBSs typically contain issue terms that specify a method through which redeeming principal is shared among investors. When redemption is done pro-rata, a pool factor {{is useful to}} investors in cases of <b>early</b> <b>repayment.</b> <b>Early</b> <b>repayment</b> reduces the amount of collateral available for an issue, and therefore some of the outstanding principal is returned to investors {{as stated in the}} issue terms. In this case, the pool factor is used to indicate how the remaining outstanding principal is adequately securitized.|$|R
50|$|Prepayment is the <b>early</b> <b>repayment</b> of a loan by a borrower, in part or in full, {{often as}} a result of {{optional}} refinancing to take advantage of lower interest rates.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the patterns of}} <b>early</b> <b>repayment</b> in multi-period credit transactions. Considered {{one of the most}} common ways of conversion of unpaid interest for <b>early</b> <b>repayment,</b> so-called 78 rule. The relationship of this rule with the linear approximation of the exact value; redeemable debt is determined. The analysis of the maximum excess payment of interest on 78 rule. It has been shown how interest payment on 78 rule depended on the time of <b>early</b> <b>repayment.</b> <b>Early</b> <b>repayment</b> of debt is an agreement under which the borrower pays to the lender amount of money equal to the current balance (as of loan account). Then further regular payments cease and the contract terminates. However, the amount of outstanding debt is determined by the structure of prescription charges. So in the uniform schemes of repayment of consumer credit each payment contains the same part of principal amounts and the total interest. In case of <b>early</b> <b>repayment</b> the Bank loses a significant fraction of the expected interest payments. Therefore, in practice, often used so-called accelerated schemes of interest payments. One of them is 78 rule. Use the 78 rule is simple and straightforward. The name of the rule is due to the fact that the sum of the numbers 12 monthly payments is 78. In the schemes of consumer loan with a term of one year interest payment for the current month is equal to m/ 78 of the total amount of interest payments, where m is the number of remaining payments. The rule name is stored and in the more general case with an arbitrary number of payments. In general interest payment is determined by the relative weight of the total amount of interest in each payment. In uniform schemes it is constant. In accelerated with a particular speed decreases. Therefore, additional cash expenses by the 78 rule may be considered as additional penalties for <b>early</b> <b>repayment</b> of the debt. It this article is shown how this penalty depends on time before maturity. It is shown that the magnitude of these penalties in monetary terms reaches the maximum value when the loan is repaid early between half and two thirds of the total of the loan term...|$|R
50|$|Puttable bond (put bond, putable or {{retractable}} bond) is a {{bond with}} an embedded put option. The holder of the puttable bond has the right, but not the obligation, to demand <b>early</b> <b>repayment</b> of the principal. The put option is exercisable on one or more specified dates.|$|R
50|$|<b>Early</b> <b>repayment</b> charge, {{redemption}} penalty or tie-in - The lender may incur {{many forms}} of up-front costs (for example property valuation costs, if not charged explicitly; or by offering a lower interest rate {{in the first few}} years of the mortgage; or - not least - remuneration of intermediaries or sales teams). It would seek to recoup these costs by charging higher interest rates over the remainder of the mortgage term. Therefore, they typically impose a penalty if the borrower repays the loan earlier than planned in order to ensure that at least some of these costs are recouped. These penalties used to be called a redemption penalty or tie-in, however since the onset of Financial Services Authority regulation they are referred to as an <b>early</b> <b>repayment</b> charge.|$|R
50|$|Put features: The {{ability of}} the holder of the bond (the lender) to force the issuer (the borrower) to repay the loan at a date earlier than the maturity.

50|$|Prepayment of {{the loan}} - when the {{borrower}} pays the loan back before it reaches term - may incur penalties, depending on the program.

40|$|Credit pricing {{is always}} an {{important}} aspect of operations of banks, as loans are generally two thirds of bank assets. Therefore, the study of factors influencing a bank customer behavior and their impact on <b>early</b> <b>repayment</b> of loans may have a significant influence in reducing the risk assumed by such unexpected operations. Objective analysis of prepayment risk is to estimate the probability of repayment to better manage its manifestation. The existence of potential customers that use this option exposes the bank to a number of risks, such as interest rate risk, the maturity mismatch risk and liquidity risk. Proper evaluation and forecasting the evolution of this risk can bring great benefits for a credit institution in the management of loan products and customer relationship: lower risk of over-ensure against fixed rate mortgage, a better management of short-term and long term liquidity needs (thus reducing the risk of over-financing) can offer customers more competitive pricing (achieved by reducing funding costs due to better assessment and management of risks involved <b>early</b> <b>repayment)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The government’s {{changes to}} how {{undergraduate}} education is financed means {{that those who}} earn more will pay {{a higher rate of}} interest repayments. Concerned that the most affluent will simply repay their fees early to avoid paying this higher interest, the government is considering introducing a levy on <b>early</b> <b>repayments.</b> Gill Wyness argues that this policy is unnecessary.

50|$|Tertiary student {{places in}} Australia are usually funded through the HECS-HELP scheme. This funding {{is in the}} form of loans that are not normal debts. They are repaid over time via a {{supplementary}} tax, using a sliding scale based on taxable income. As a consequence, loan repayments are only made when the former student has income to support the repayments. Discounts are available for <b>early</b> <b>repayment.</b> The scheme is available to citizens and permanent humanitarian visa holders. Means-tested scholarships for living expenses are also available. Special assistance is available to indigenous students.|$|R
40|$|A {{cash flow}} model is {{developed}} {{to set the}} price for a loan to a borrower with known risks. Similarities are noted between this model and those used for profit testing in life insurance. We emphasize aspects that reasonably can be treated in several ways and also indicate where the cash flow model differs from the pricing methods usually employed in bank lending. The sensitivity of interest rates to various parameters of the model such as the length of loan and the expected default rate is examined. Also, we examine how features of loans, including cash back and <b>early</b> <b>repayments,</b> can be priced...|$|R
50|$|Also, {{consider}} whether the term loan {{you are looking}} at uses compound interest. If it does, the amount of interest will be periodically added to the principal borrowed amount, meaning that the interest keeps getting higher the longer the term lasts. If the loan does use compound interest, check {{to see if there are}} any penalties for <b>early</b> <b>repayment</b> of the loan. If you get a windfall our profits increase spectacularly, you may be able to pay off your entire balance before it is due, preventing you from paying additional interest by waiting for the loan term to end.|$|R
