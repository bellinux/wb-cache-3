40|$|The Mars Rover/Sample Return <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> {{examined}} as {{a precursor}} to a manned mission to Mars. The value of precursor <b>missions</b> <b>is</b> noted, using the Apollo lunar program as an example. The scientific objectives of the Mars Rover/Sample Return <b>mission</b> <b>are</b> listed and the basic <b>mission</b> plans <b>are</b> described.

5|$|The fourth {{mission in}} the World Heritage Site, the mission of Concepción, was {{initially}} founded in 1699 by the Jesuit priests Fr. Francisco Lucas Caballero and Fr. Francisco Hervás. A nearby mission, San Ignacio de Boococas, was incorporated in 1708. The <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> moved three times: in 1707, 1708 and 1722. The <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> inhabited by the Chiquitanos, the largest tribe in the region. The mission church was constructed between 1752 and 1756, by Fr. Martin Schmid and Fr. Johann Messner. From 1975 to 1996 the <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> reconstructed as part of Hans Roth's restoration project.|$|E
5|$|The fourth <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> {{initiated}} in 2001. This fully autonomous mission involved three scenarios requiring the same autonomous behavior.|$|E
5|$|The next European {{known to}} have visited the Key Biscayne area was Pedro Menéndez de Avilés. In 1565 his ship took refuge in Biscayne Bay from a storm. Relations were {{established}} with the Tequesta, and in 1567 a <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> established on the mainland across the bay from Key Biscayne. The <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> abandoned three years later in 1570. No other <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> established on the mainland until 1743, but it was withdrawn a few months later.|$|E
50|$|In {{campaign}} mode several <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> available, throughout World War II. There are 3 campaigns {{throughout the}} game: American, Canadian, and the British. The American <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> Operation Market Garden, Operation Avalanche, and Operation Detroit. The Canadian <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> the Battle of the Scheldt, Operation Infatuate, and Operation Blockbuster. The British <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity. Although there are 14 levels total, each take place during a certain mission from World War II.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mission</b> <b>is</b> {{a city in}} Hidalgo County, Texas. The {{population}} was 80,452 in 2012. <b>Mission</b> <b>is</b> part of the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission and Reynosa-McAllen metropolitan areas.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mission</b> <b>is</b> an unincorporated {{community}} in Sussex County, Delaware, United States. <b>Mission</b> <b>is</b> located along Delaware Route 24 and Delaware Route 30 southwest of Millsboro.|$|R
5|$|This fourth IARC <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> {{conducted}} at the U.S. Army's Fort Benning Soldier Battle Lab using the McKenna MOUT (Military Operations on Urban Terrain) site, which replicates a complete German village created for war gaming when the main cold war threat was perceived {{to come through the}} Fulda Gap into Germany. The fourth <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> completed in 2008 with various teams having already demonstrated all of the required aerial robotic behaviors mandated by the fourth mission rules, except being able to demonstrate these behaviors seamlessly in under 15 minutes—a feat considered by the organizer and judges to be inevitable given a bit more time, and therefore no longer a significant challenge. Thus the fourth <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> terminated, $80,000 in awards distributed, and the fifth mission established.|$|E
5|$|This week, the <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> a {{chemistry}} test with John Barrowman, which involved his giving the Marias a surprise kiss.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} recent impact created Cone crater, 1,000 feet across and 250 feet deep, near the landing site of Apollo 14. One {{of the main}} objectives of that <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> to sample the original Imbrium material located on its rim.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mission</b> <b>is</b> a {{fundamental}} {{purpose of a}} company that remains unchanged over time. The mission provides a guidance for decision making and gives a path to successful results.

50|$|The primary <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> {{to prepare}} for wartime taskings as {{specified}} by applicable gaining commands. The peacetime <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> {{under the control of}} the Governor of California. Upon mobilization, primary specified <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> combat search and rescue (CSAR). When directed by the California State Office of Emergency Services (OES) and/or the Department of Defense (DoD), the <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> to provide disaster relief support as required.

5|$|In 1981, a {{proposal}} for an asteroid <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> submitted to the European Space Agency (ESA). Named the Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis (AGORA), this spacecraft was to launch some time in 1990–1994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> Vesta. AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past Mars or {{by means of a}} small ion engine. However, the proposal was refused by the ESA. A joint NASA–ESA asteroid <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> then drawn up for a Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion (MAOSEP), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission. Instead, the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy and the United States, but none were approved. Exploration of Vesta by fly-by and impacting penetrator was the second main target of the first plan of the multi-aimed Soviet Vesta mission, developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991–1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding.|$|E
50|$|St. Joseph's <b>Mission</b> <b>is</b> a <b>mission</b> that <b>was</b> {{established}} in Oregon Territory (now Washington State), United States (US) by Jesuit priests in 1852.

5|$|The {{campaign}} {{plays out}} through 26 missions, with story scenes that tie the plot together occurring between {{and during the}} battles. In addition, 38 training <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> unlocked as the <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> completed. The training <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> more challenging, entirely optional, and can be played separately from the campaign. One new feature in Days of Ruin <b>is</b> that campaign <b>missions</b> can now <b>be</b> played individually as the player completes them.

5|$|In Mission: Earth, Voyage to the Home Planet, {{astronaut}} Thomas David Jones recounts {{his experiences}} studying the Earth {{during his first}} mission with the United States space agency NASA. Jones' space mission lasted eleven days. Jones {{was a member of}} the crew of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which left Earth in April 1994. The <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> intended to provide the Space Radar Lab with a view of the planet. By using three separate radar echoes, scientists were able to analyze a full image of the planet. The radar technology could penetrate obstructions, including clouds and thick outgrowth of trees. Another purpose of the <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> to analyze the ecological state of the planet and to take measurements of pollution caused by carbon monoxide.|$|E
5|$|In the Apollo11 {{photographic}} record {{there are}} only five images of Armstrong partly shown or reflected. The <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> planned to the minute, {{with the majority of}} photographic tasks to be performed by Armstrong with a single Hasselblad camera.|$|E

5|$|One initial {{emergency}} flight abort (RTLS) sub-orbital test <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> canceled {{due to high}} risk. Many other planned missions were canceled due to the late development of the shuttle, and the Challenger and Columbia disasters.|$|E
50|$|The key {{difference}} between this mission and previous <b>missions</b> <b>is</b> that these <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> focused on capacity building in the host nation.
