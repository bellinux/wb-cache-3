They are not disparate aspects of social work but merely two faces {{of the same coin}} to be spent on more and better services for the people who need our help. It is out of our belief in this broad definition of responsibility for social welfare that NASW is taking leadership in the efforts to reorder our nation's priorities and future direction, and is calling on social workers everywhere to do the same.|$|E

Chen alleged that his primary function at the consulate involved efforts to monitor and harass Falun Gong and to minimize support for the practice from Australian media and elected officials. Zeng stated that [...] "espionage and intimidation against [...] practitioners overseas is so common that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> become accustomed to it." ...|$|E

The 300-page bill was exceptional, but other heavy users received 50- to 100-page bills. One {{of the first}} to attract wider attention was from Ben Kuchera, gaming editor for the technology-related website Ars Technica, who described his 34-sheet, double-sided bill and another 104-page bill sent to a colleague, writing, [...] "While <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> had smart-phones for some time, we've never seen a bill like this."

M.I.A. described the sound and imagery of the album as capturing a [...] "digital ruckus", adding that [...] "so <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> become typists and voyeurs".

500|$|West {{has been}} an outspoken and {{controversial}} celebrity throughout his career, receiving both criticism and praise from many, including the mainstream media, other artists and entertainers, and two U.S. presidents. On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina relief on NBC (A Concert for Hurricane Relief), he deviated from the prepared script to criticize the media's portrayal of, and the federal response to, black hurricane victims. He criticized President George W. Bush for not [...] "car about black people". Bush stated {{in an interview that}} the comment was [...] "one of the most disgusting moments" [...] of his presidency. In November 2010, in a taped interview with Matt Lauer for the Today show, West expressed regret for his criticism of Bush. Reactions were mixed, but some felt that West had no need to apologize. [...] "It was not the particulars of your words that mattered, it was the essence of a feeling of the insensitivity towards our communities that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> felt for far too long", argued Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons.|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} for TV Squad, writer Richard Keller gave the episode a mixed to {{positive}} review, calling the installment [...] "pretty unique", {{but that it}} also had its flaws. He enjoyed {{the fact that the}} episode revealed the relationship between Shawn and Henry, that it [...] "reflects the relationship <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> with our own fathers". He also enjoyed the [...] "fleshing out" [...] of Gus's character, that [...] "we now see Gus as quite the brainiac" [...] and [...] "rather than saying nothing but 'No, Shawn'... Gus actually contributes quite a bit to this episode". However, Keller also criticized parts of the episode, saying that he disliked the [...] "whole fake psychic concept". Keller also criticized Timothy Omundson's character Carlton Lassiter, saying [...] "he just doesn't fit into the whole show", and [...] "Omundson's makes Lassiter look like a cartoon character". In a comment for TV Guide, the show was called [...] "a diamond in the rough", and writer Matt Roush called star James Roday [...] "a delight". The episode was included in Yahoo! TV's list of the nerdiest episodes of Psych. Reviewer Tucker Cummings said that [...] "the wordplay in this episode great" [...] and that [...] "it gives you a great insight into how Gus and Shawn's friendship has functioned (or dysfunctioned) over the years". In addition, she said that the episode's murder-mystery plot [...] "is actually really engrossing" [...] when compared to later episodes of the show.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the history}} of every profession, there is {{a period in which}} a diverse group of {{practitioners}} work in various ways to [...] "consolidate authority". [...] For medicine, this period is best known for the Flexner Report (1910) that rated medical schools and gave a major boost to the AMA leadership and elite physicians who were trying to upgrade and standardize medical education. [...] Educational standards for admission into the profession went along with earlier reorganization of the professional associationâ€”the AMAâ€”to incorporate all practicing physicians (grandfathering in those who did not meet current standards), and a previous growth in state licensing that provided the legal authority for professional practice. [...] For some professions consolidation never happens: [...] nursing has spent a century debating educational standards, divided in identity, torn between being a labor force and a profession. [...] In 1984, former Congressman (FL) Paul Rogers noted in his introductory essay to a volume on Advocacy in Health Care, [...] "Advocacy in health care is a calling <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> pursuedâ€”one way or anotherâ€”for many years.

2500|$|That same month, John Henderson of Canterbury University stated that, in his view, many Pacific Islanders {{are worried}} [...] "that their {{livelihood}} {{is being taken}} away by Chinese traders coming in, often getting in buying political privileges, {{playing a role in}} rigging elections". Henderson suggested that the 2006 anti-Chinese riots in Tonga and Solomon Islands could be repeated in countries such as Fiji and Vanuatu. He added that this might lead the PRC to increase its role in the region further, in order to protect ethnic Chinese Pacific Islanders. A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Fiji, Hu Lihua, responded by stating: [...] "China does not pose a military threat to any other country. China opposes all forms of hegemonism and power politics and will never seek hegemony or engage in expansion." [...] A representative of Fiji's Chinese community similarly rejected the idea that there might be anti-Chinese riots in Fiji, and added: [...] "The Chinese in Fiji have an excellent relationship with locals and we contribute toward the economy. We have been successful in understanding local customs. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> learnt the language and have assimilated." ...|$|E
2500|$|May's public reticence {{during the}} {{referendum}} campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled {{that she would}} support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later {{went on to say}} before the 2017 UK general election that she would be willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that [...] "no deal is better than a bad deal. We {{have to be prepared to}} walk out". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was [...] "disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market." [...] Phil Wilson for the 'Open Britain' group said, [...] "It's good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy.

[...] He praised the gameplay, especially the Good Cop/Bad Cop system and the upgrades system. He also praised the absence of loading screens. However, he wrote of the graphics, [...] "there are far too many clipping issues that come up far too often to be ignored. Similarly, the camera ties into the clipping problems so {{that there will be}} times when the camera will float through and behind a wall or tree during a fight so that you can't see the action at all." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime is an enjoyable game if you can clear your mind of Grand Theft Auto expectations [...] It's a lot of fun despite the burden of the camera system and other technical glitches. It doesn't, nor should it, replace Grand Theft Auto by any means. True Crime has enough good to counter the bad and stand on its own." [...] Boulding and Tom McNamara scored the PC version 8 out of 10, writing [...] "the multiplayer that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> been salivating for is almost disorientingly low-budget." [...] They were also critical of the controls and graphics, concluding [...] "the rich fighting component and the shooting and driving mechanics aren't translated well to the PC, with awkward controls, poor texture quality, and odd visual bugs.

College presidents, academic deans and deans of admission do not know enough about other institutions to make meaningful comparisons. This gives a false sense of reliability to what is a ranking system without any real validity." [...] Sweet Briar College president, Elizabeth S. Muhlenfeld stated that, [...] "one of our colleagues likened it to trying to rank composers. It's a great analogy. How can you say that Beethoven and Brahms are better than Mahler or Mozart?" [...] Trinity Washington University president Patricia McGuire argued that, [...] "the survey asks me to 'rate the academic quality of undergraduate programs,' assigning each school a single score using a 1-to-5 scale from 'marginal' to 'distinguished.' That I have little real information about these 181 institutions does not seem to matter to the U.S. News editors [...] Some of the actual best colleges in this nation do not fare well in the U.S. News survey because {{they do not have the}} wealth, big-time sports notoriety or public relations clout to influence the peer voting system." [...] Finally, DePauw University president, Robert G. Bottoms, argued that, [...] "I, in fact, did not fill out the reputational survey for this past year. [...] I came to the conclusion that I am not in a position to make judgments on other schools, many of which I have little or no familiarity with. The fact that one quarter of a college's ranking is based upon what is, in essence, its popularity, is very disturbing and we choose not to be a part of the process." ...|$|E
