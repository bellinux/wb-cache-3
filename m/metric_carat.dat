50|$|George Frederick Kunz, a Tiffany’s gemologist, was {{instrumental}} in the international adoption of the <b>metric</b> <b>carat</b> as a weight standard for gems, and the Tiffany standard for sterling and platinum have been adopted as U.S. standards. The 128.54 carat g Tiffany Yellow Diamond is usually on display in the New York City flagship store.|$|E
50|$|The carat (ct) is {{a unit of}} mass {{equal to}} 200 mg (0.2 g; 0.007055 oz) and is used for {{measuring}} gemstones and pearls.The current definition, sometimes known as the <b>metric</b> <b>carat,</b> was adopted in 1907 at the Fourth General Conference on Weights and Measures, and soon afterwards in many countries around the world. The carat is divisible into one hundred points of two milligrams each. Other subdivisions, and slightly different mass values, {{have been used in}} the past in different locations.|$|E

50|$|The stone {{eventually}} reappeared in Turkey, {{where it}} had been given the new name 'Shepherd's Stone'. It was then purchased in 1866 in Istanbul by London merchant George Blogg, who commissioned Levi Moses Auerhaan to re-cut it into drop-form. Unfortunately the historic inscriptions were destroyed in the process. The stone, which had originally weighed 120 Arabic <b>carats</b> (about 119 <b>metric</b> <b>carats</b> 23 g), had been reduced to 73.60 <b>metric</b> <b>carats</b> (14.34 g). In the following year, the diamond was purchased by Malhar Rao Gaekwad of Baroda, India, for what was said to have been 350,000 rupees (about £26,000).|$|R
5000|$|Weighing 112 3/16 <b>carats</b> (115.16 modern <b>metric</b> <b>carats,</b> erroneously {{reported}} by many others as 110+/- carats), the crudely finished gem {{was described by}} the French gem dealer Jean-Baptiste Tavernier as a [...] "violet" [...] (which was in those days a synonym for blue) and of perfect clarity. Tavernier was a French traveler and trader, returning to France from India {{with many of the}} largest gems of the era, which he primarily sold to the French royalty and aristocracy. The diamond was certainly Indian in origin and likely sourced by Tavernier in 1666 at the Kollur mine in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. Tavernier sold it to Louis XIV of France.|$|R
50|$|The Excelsior Diamond is a gem-quality diamond, and was {{the largest}} known diamond in {{the world from the}} time of its {{discovery}} in 1893 until 1905, when the larger Cullinan Diamond was found. It was found on June 30, 1893 at the Jagersfontein Mine in South Africa, 130 km south east of Kimberley whose fame as a diamond mining center always overshadowed that of Jagersfontein. It had a blue-white tint and weighed 971 old <b>carats</b> or 995.2 <b>metric</b> <b>carats</b> (or 194 g). The Excelsior rates as the third largest rough diamond of gem quality ever found. It was ultimately cut into ten stones weighing from 13 to 68 carats. (2.6 to 13.6 g).|$|R
5000|$|Several accounts, {{based on}} remarks written by French gem {{merchant}} Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who obtained the gem in India in 1666, {{suggest that the}} gemstone originated in India, in the Kollur mine in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh (which {{at the time was}} part of the Golconda kingdom), in the seventeenth century. It is unclear who had initially owned the gemstone, where it had been found, by whom, and in what condition. But the first historical records suggest that Tavernier obtained the stone in 1666, possibly by purchase or by theft. Tavernier brought to Paris a large uncut stone which was the first known precursor to the Hope Diamond. This large stone became known as the Tavernier Blue diamond. It was a crudely cut triangular shaped stone of 115 carat g. Another estimate is that it weighed 112.23 carat g before it was cut. Tavernier's book, the Six Voyages (French: Les Six Voyages de J. B. Tavernier), contains sketches of several large diamonds that he sold to Louis XIV in possibly 1668 or 1669; while the blue diamond is shown among these, Tavernier mentions the mines at [...] "Gani" [...] Kollur as a source of colored diamonds, but made no direct mention of the stone. Historian Richard Kurin builds a highly speculative case for 1653 as the year of acquisition, but the most that can be said with certainty is that Tavernier obtained the blue diamond during one of his five voyages to India between the years 1640 and 1667. One report suggests he took 25 diamonds to Paris, including the large rock which became the Hope, and sold all of them to King Louis XIV. Another report suggested that in 1669, Tavernier sold this large blue diamond along with approximately one thousand other diamonds to King Louis XIV of France for 220,000 livres, the equivalent of 147 kilograms of pure gold. In a newly published historical novel, The French Blue, gemologist and historian Richard W. Wise proposed that the patent of nobility granted Tavernier by Louis XIV {{was a part of the}} payment for the Tavernier Blue. According to the theory, during that period Colbert, the King's Finance Minister, regularly sold offices and noble titles for cash, and an outright patent of nobility, according to Wise, was worth approximately 500,000 livres making a total of 720,000 livres, a price about half Tavernier's estimate of the gem's true value. There has been some controversy regarding the actual weight of the stone; Morel believed that the 112 carats stated in Tavernier's invoice would be in old French <b>carats,</b> thus 115.28 <b>metric</b> <b>carats.</b>|$|R
