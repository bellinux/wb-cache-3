5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings in the past. As {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls of the basement, in order to make sure it stayed dry.|$|E
25|$|As a {{conservative}} Christian, Boone declined certain songs and movie roles {{that he felt}} might compromise his beliefs—including a role with sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. In {{one of his first}} films, April Love, the director, Henry Levin, wanted him to give co-star Shirley Jones a kiss (which was not in the script). Since this would be his first onscreen kiss, Boone said that he wanted to talk to his wife first, to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all right with her. He had his own film production company, Cooga Mooga Productions.|$|E
25|$|On 16 March 1989, {{an engine}} {{fire broke out}} aboard Oregon II while she was moored at Mobile, Alabama. Her chief engineer, Mr. James V. Brosh, entered the smoke-filled engine room to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> clear of {{personnel}} before discharging carbon dioxide into the area to fight the fire. He later personally directed Mobile Fire Department firefighters in extinguishing the blaze. His actions were credited with limiting the damage and saving the ship, and for his courage and heroism in ensuring the safety of personnel and in fighting the fire, he received the Department of Commerce Silver Medal later in 1989.|$|E

25|$|Worship and temples {{appear to}} have been {{routinely}} offered by Greeks to their Roman governors, with varied reactions. Cicero declined a temple proposed by the city officials of Roman Asia to his brother and himself, while the latter was proconsul, to avoid jealousy from other Romans; when Cicero himself was Governor of Cilicia, he claimed to have accepted no statues, shrines, or chariots. His predecessor, Appius Claudius Pulcher, was so pleased, however, when the Cilicians built a temple to him that, when it was not finished at the end of Claudius' year in office, Claudius wrote Cicero to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> done, and complaining that Cicero was not active enough in the matter.|$|E
500|$|Gandhi {{also wrote}} several books {{including}} his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth (Gujarātī [...] "સત્યના પ્રયોગો અથવા આત્મકથા"), {{of which he}} bought the entire first edition to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> reprinted. His other autobiographies included: Satyagraha in South Africa about his struggle there, Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule, a political pamphlet, and a paraphrase in Gujarati of John Ruskin's Unto This Last. This last essay can be considered his programme on economics. He also wrote extensively on vegetarianism, diet and health, religion, social reforms, etc. Gandhi usually wrote in Gujarati, though he also revised the Hindi and English translations of his books.|$|E
500|$|The film's climatic battle {{sequence}} {{takes place}} through the nine worlds {{by the use}} of portals. Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, [...] "We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing we {{wanted to do was to}} <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes there are times when Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, quite frankly. We made sure we always kept up the momentum and never stopped the fight. It was a way of making sure the audience weren't conscious there was an effect going on." ...|$|E

500|$|Tess Harper was {{performing}} {{on stage in}} Texas when she attended a casting call for a minor role in the film. Beresford {{was so impressed with}} her that he cast her in the lead. He later said that the actresses he had seen before her demonstrated a sophistication and worldliness inappropriate for the part, while she brought a kind of rural quality without coming across as simple or foolish. Beresford said of Harper, [...] "She walked into the room and even before she spoke, I thought, 'That's the girl to play the lead. Harper said she knew she won the role when Beresford appeared on her doorstep with a bottle of champagne in each hand. Tender Mercies was Harper's feature film debut, and she was so excited about the role she bit her script to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> real. When filming ended, Duvall gave her a blue cowgirl shirt as a gift with a card that read, [...] "You really were Rosa Lee".|$|E
500|$|The core concept did {{not change}} {{over the course of}} development, though the other content did. Messhof limited the game's {{exposure}} during this time as he wanted the game to be respected in the fighting game genre and wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> ready first. Messhof himself, however, did not have much experience in this genre. He said that he [...] "spent a lot of time" [...] on the gameplay's feel and designed it to play slowly, where players wait for their opponent to move first, similar to Bushido Blade. He also spent time adding divekicks and cartwheels while improving the melee attacks and spectator experience. Some moves, such as a Yoshi-style [...] "ground pound" [...] and the Karate Kid crane kick, were attempted and removed. In testing, he would observe players and their strategies before attempting to write an artificial intelligence to use similar strategies. Messhof considers the single-player to be training for the online multiplayer, and the online multiplayer training for live matches. He described his process as making [...] "the most fun game" [...] to play with his friends.|$|E
500|$|A Day to Remember were {{pressed for}} a new album by their record label, Victory, in early 2008; bassist Joshua Woodard said the band weren't ready to record a new album at the time. This {{resulted}} in a re-release of their previous album, For Those Who Have Heart (2007), with additional tracks. The songs featured on Homesick were written while the band were on Warped Tour 2008 and on the Easycore Tour with producer Chad Gilbert of New Found Glory. The songs were finished on the latter tour. Gilbert helped to structure the band's songs and also assisted the band with composing [...] "a few really catchy parts". The album's lyrics are similar to their previous efforts, with the band aiming to [...] "keep it as personal and open at the same time", as vocalist Jeremy McKinnon commented. Speaking of the album's sound, McKinnon said that the band [...] "wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> heavier and poppier" [...] {{while at the same}} time trying [...] "to take it to the next level".|$|E

500|$|On 20November 2007, a 20th anniversary {{edition of}} The Joshua Tree was released. The album was remastered from the {{original}} analogue recordings {{under the direction of}} the Edge, with the original vinyl album artwork restored. The release was made available in four formats: a single CD; a two-disc deluxe edition with a bonus audio CD of B-sides, rarities, and demos; a three-disc box set with the bonus audio CD and DVD, photograph prints, and hardcover book; and a double vinyl edition. All editions included liner notes by author Bill Flanagan and previously unseen photographs by Anton Corbijn. Manager Paul McGuinness explained, [...] "There has been continuous demand from U2 fans to have The Joshua Tree properly re-mastered. As always, the band had to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> right, and now it is." [...] Some formats include expanded liner notes from the band members, the production team, and Anton Corbijn. In an otherwise favourable review of the remastered album, Andrew Mueller of Uncut said that [...] "any casual listener who can perceive a meaningful difference between this and the original has i) ears like a bat and/or ii) needs to get out more".|$|E
500|$|Many live {{instruments}} were {{used during the}} album's production, especially violin. Milian named [...] "You Make Me Laugh" [...] {{one of her favorite}} songs on the album. It was the first song written by Milian for the album, and she worked with Bloodshy for the song's production. The album's second and final single, [...] "When You Look at Me", was written by Milian. Using her school days as the inspiration for the song, Milian said that [...] "when I was growing up, I found people were always trying to label me. The first day of school it would be like 'Here comes this girl all dressed up. She thinks she's all that' and they didn't even know me. The message behind 'When You Look At Me' is never judge a book by its cover." [...] Milian asked Ja Rule to appear on her album, however {{she did not want to}} put him [...] "on just any song", and wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the right song for him. Milian hoped Ja Rule would appear on the track [...] "A Girl Like Me", but he ended up rapping on [...] "Get Away". Milian co-wrote the track [...] "Twitch" [...] with R singer Montell Jordan, which explains that men have a certain twitch of their shoulders whenever they tell lies.|$|E
500|$|The Way I See It was {{engineered}} by Saadiq, Gerry Brown, James Tanksley, and Brungardt, who mixed the album with Saadiq. Saadiq and Brungardt both liked to layer multiple instruments and, prior to recording, had contemplated {{techniques such as}} sampling and drum programming. However, they ultimately found live instrumentalists more dynamic and challenged themselves to reproduce older music productions and the Motown aesthetic of the 1960s. To familiarize themselves with vintage recording techniques, they studied Mark Lewisohn's 1988 book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, books about Motown Records, and images of the label's studio personnel, setup of instruments, and microphone placement. They also studied Motown EQs to achieve a tone they found adequate for songs' rhythm guitar parts. Saadiq {{said that he had}} to disregard [...] "about 85 to 90 percent of the new techniques ... People used to take recording very seriously. They used to wear lab coats at Abbey Road. So I got serious with what I was trying to do, both mentally and physically." [...] Brungardt said in an interview for Mix that he abandoned the approach learned on previous records he had engineered, where [...] "they wanted it clean with no distortion. I was taught to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> polish, polish, polish, and to make sure everything fits right, the bass hits and things are clean for the big pop vocal." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1970, Volk {{helped lead}} the Colts to another Super Bowl appearance, but were now {{representing}} the AFC following the merger of the two leagues (NFL and AFL) that year. [...] This time, the Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V. [...] Volk was responsible for covering Pro Football Hall of Famers Bob Hayes and Mike Ditka in the Super Bowl, and he {{played a key role}} in the Colts' victory. [...] In the fourth quarter, the Colts trailed the Cowboys 136. [...] Volk intercepted a pass by Cowboys quarterback Craig Morton at the Dallas 33-yard line and returned it 30 yards to the 3-yard line to set up the tying touchdown. [...] Baltimore quarterback Earl Morrall later referred to Volk's interception as the play of the game. [...] Interviewed in 2009, Volk cited Super Bowl V as his fondest memory of playing in Baltimore. [...] He recalled team owner Carroll Rosenbloom flying the whole team, families included, to the Bahamas the day after the game: [...] "The next day we all got on the plane and flew over to the Bahamas. He took the whole family – my wife and one kid, at the time. I remember we were on the beach, Tom Mitchell and I, and we got the paper to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> really true - that we did win.

2500|$|Aside {{from his}} {{contributions}} to the Michigan hockey program, Renfrew and his wife Marguerite are credited in some accounts as the individuals responsible for the football tradition of the [...] "M" [...] Club banner at Michigan Stadium. The tradition started in 1962 with Michigan players racing {{out of the tunnel}} and leaping into the air to touch the [...] "Go Blue: M Club Supports You" [...] banner while the Marching Band plays [...] "The Victors." [...] Renfrew reportedly asked his wife to make two flags to drape over the football lockerrooms to cheer on the team. [...] She made two flags, with a neighbor, and the Block M was designed by Bob Hoisington, an Engineering Dean, to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> correct. They handmade the flags, which was not an easy feat at the time. Originally, the M Club members hung the banners the lockerroom, and the banners were later moved to the tunnel and then the stadium.
