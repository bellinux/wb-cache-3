40|$|<b>Migration</b> <b>policy</b> in Germany {{today is}} better than its {{reputation}} would suggest.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{explores the}} {{empirical}} support behind {{the idea that}} there is a trade‐off between the size of low‐skilled migrant labor populations and the rights and entitlements accorded to them. We first look at the empirical correlation between measures of migrants’ rights and the size of both the stock and flow of immigrants in a number of existing databases. Using data on migrants’ rights from three recent studies—the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Migrant Accessibility Index, the <b>Migration</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Group</b> and British Council’s Migrant Integration Policy Index, and the Human Development Report Office’s Migrant Entitlements and Services Index—we fail to find a systematic correlation of any sign. We then turn to regression analysis using ordinary least squares and instrumental variable techniques, and again fail to find evidence in favor of the existence of a correlation. The numerical magnitudes of the correlations suggest a quantitatively small relationship that in several cases is positive rather than negative.

30|$|The main {{aim of the}} ICS was to ‘increase {{the voice}} of {{immigrants}} {{in the development of}} integration policies’ (Huddleston & Tjaden, 2012, p. 10) and therefore add immigrants’ subjective views and experiences to the debate on how well integration policies operate in Europe. The survey covered the themes of employment, language skills and training, political and civic participation, family reunion, long-term residence as well as naturalisation and citizenship acquisition of immigrants. According to the institutes who were responsible for managing the survey, the King Baudouin Foundation (KBF) and the <b>Migration</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Group</b> (MPG), the specific objectives of the survey were to ‘increase the knowledge about migrants’ needs, experiences, aspirations – and of policy impacts[, to] assist policy actors in creating more effective integration policies and addressing the other factors that influence the integration process [and to] demonstrate the value of surveying immigrants for informing policies and public discourse’ (Huddleston & Tjaden, 2012, p. 11). The survey was carried out under the responsibility of the KBF and MPG, jointly with national coordinators and polling institutes, in 15 cities in seven European countries, including Belgium (Antwerp, Brussels and Liege), France (Lyon and Paris), Germany (Berlin and Stuttgart), Hungary (Budapest), Italy (Milan and Naples), Portugal (Faro, Lisbon and Setubal) and Spain (Barcelona and Madrid).|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{this work}} has been to {{understand}} if integration policies help immigrants to enhance their long-term success and parity with natives. Immigrant integration has been conceived as the process aimed at reducing gaps with natives, therefore at providing to immigrants the same opportunities of native-born citizens, in the main domains of life. The first paper of the thesis has offered a comparative overview of civic integration programmes adopted by European countries in recent years. I have argued that civic integration produces a ‘stratification’ of the immigrant population in receiving countries, because it exacerbates the gap between high-skilled and low-skilled immigrants, therefore between wanted and unwanted migration. Moreover, civic integration is strongly embedded into citizenship, since it establishes under what conditions eligible immigrants can obtain the citizenship status of the new residence country. Therefore, the second paper has examined the effect of both individual-level characteristics and measures of national citizenship policies on the likelihood of having citizenship status among immigrants living in selected European countries. As individual level data I have used the Immigrant Citizens Survey (ICS), conducted by the King Baudouin Foundation and the <b>Migration</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Group,</b> from October 2011 to January 2012. For the country-level data, a systematic review of national citizenship policies, academic literature and the Eurostat database have been used. Results have highlighted the strong effect of individual characteristics on citizenship status among young and adult immigrants and, therefore, {{the positive effect of}} higher family stability, educational attainment, current economic situation, perceived financial well-being, duration of residence and cultural similarity between the country of residence and the country of origin. Nevertheless, policy factors intervene to produce this effect. In particular, a low number of years of residence needed for naturalization, the dual citizenship toleration and relatively high naturalization rates and proportions of foreign citizens positively influence citizenship status among immigrants. Finally, self-reported life satisfaction has been used in the third paper to assess immigrants’ subjective integration. Self-reported life satisfaction has allowed taking into account not only objective forms of integration, but also immigrants’ perceptions about their life into the residence country. This is also in line with the idea that integration is a multidimensional and two-way process, which implies the contribution and {{the point of view of}} both newcomers and hosting societies. The positive linkage existing between citizenship status and life satisfaction in the residence country provides evidence for the objective character of naturalization in shaping integration, which, although made more demanding by civic requirements, represents, to this day, the best way for immigrants to acquire parity with natives...|$|E

Migration intention is critical to the effectiveness of ecological <b>migration</b> <b>policy.</b> However, studies on migration intention in relation to ecological <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> in China remain scant. Thus this paper aims to investigate the rural residents’ migration intentions and their affecting factors under ecological <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> in Minqin County, an ecological restoration area, located at the lower terminus of Shiyang River Basin in arid Northwest China. The data for this study come from a randomly sampled household questionnaire survey. Results from logistic regression modelling indicate that most residents do not intend to migrate, despite rigid eco-environmental conditions and governance polices threatening livelihood sustainability. In addition to demographic and socio-economic factors, the eco-environmental factors are also significantly correlated with the possibility of a resident intending to migrate. The implications of the significant independent variables for the sustainability of ecological <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> are discussed. The paper concludes that ecological <b>migration</b> <b>policies</b> may ultimately be more sustainable when taking into account household interests within complex migration intention contexts, such as household livelihoods dynamics and environmental change...|$|R
