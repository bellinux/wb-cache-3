5|$|In Granville, NY22 was {{originally}} routed on Quaker, <b>Main,</b> <b>and</b> North streets. It was rerouted {{in the mid-1960s}} to bypass Granville on a new highway west of the village. NY149 was then extended northward along NY22's former routing to the junction of <b>Main</b> <b>and</b> North streets in Granville. From there, it continued eastward on Main Street to reach the Vermont state line, where it connected to VT30B, a spur route of VT30 {{that had been in}} place since 1935. Vermont renumbered VT30B to VT149 at this time to match the highway it now connected to in New York.|$|E
5|$|ALP's Letter {{becomes the}} focal point as it is {{analysed}} in detail in I.5. This letter was dictated by ALP to her son Shem, a writer, and entrusted to her other son Shaun, a postman, for delivery. The letter never reaches its intended destination, ending up in a midden heap where it is unearthed by a hen named Biddy. Chapter I.6 digresses from the narrative in order to present the <b>main</b> <b>and</b> minor characters in more detail, {{in the form of}} twelve riddles and answers.|$|E
5|$|After the Nazis came to power, {{the design}} was given priority. Despite initial {{competition}} from the Henschel Hs 123, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM, the German aviation ministry) turned to the designs of Herman Pohlmann of Junkers and co-designer of the K 47, Karl Plauth. During the trials with the K 47 in 1932, the double vertical stabilizers were introduced to give the rear gunner a better field of fire. The <b>main,</b> <b>and</b> {{what was to be}} the most distinctive, feature of the Ju 87 was its double-spar inverted gull wings.|$|E

5|$|Between 1869 and 1870, {{the society}} {{completed}} {{construction of a}} new two-story brick building on Lot 56 at the corner of West <b>Main</b> <b>and</b> North High Streets known as Literary Hall, where it could hold its meetings and reassemble the remaining volumes from its original library. Literary Hall was built upon the former location of the shuttered Bank of the South Branch of the Potomac. In addition to the 400 volumes that were initially recovered following the war, the society recovered several more volumes from its original library, and set about purchasing new books; the restored library was reopened with about 700 volumes.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his success}} in Sydney, Jackson was tapped to direct the audio design and {{production}} at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he directed the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. His sound design for BC Place Stadium did not have loudspeakers at ground level aimed up at the seating areas—Jackson determined that this approach would produce too much uncontrolled reverberation from sound waves bouncing off the ceiling. Instead, he configured two rings of loudspeakers {{hung from the ceiling}} 100ft (30m) above the ground, aimed downward. The inner ring held 8 arrays each composed of 12 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers and the outer ring held 12 arrays of 7 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers, augmented by 16 subwoofers. The lot was powered by 160 Lab.gruppen amplifiers which were also hung from the ceiling, and were networked via Dante in a triple-redundant configuration. Two DiGiCo D5 digital mixing consoles served as <b>main</b> <b>and</b> backup for the main audience sound, and two Yamaha PM1Ds handled <b>main</b> <b>and</b> backup duties for monitor mixing. Other equipment included dual-redundant Optocore fibre connections, two Dolby Lake Processors, and time code generated by two pairs of Fairlights which also handled audio cues timed to the action on the field.|$|E
5|$|Following the victory, Maryland {{patrolled the}} {{southern}} approaches to Surigao Strait until 29 October; she then steamed for the Admiralty Isles for brief replenishment and resumed patrol duty around Leyte on 16 November, protecting the landing forces from continued Japanese air attacks. On 29 November, during another Japanese air attack, a kamikaze aircraft surprised and struck Maryland. The aircraft crashed into Maryland between Turrets No. 1 and 2, piercing the forecastle, <b>main,</b> <b>and</b> armored decks and blowing {{a hole in}} the 4-inch steel, causing extensive damage and starting fires. In all, 31 men were killed and 30 wounded in the attack, and the medical department was destroyed but still functional.|$|E

5|$|For a {{while it}} seemed that Franklin would also be burnt, but her crew were able {{to put out the}} fires. With Brueys killed aboard Orient, Du Chayla now became commander. Both he and Captain Gillet had been seriously wounded and taken below, but he {{continued}} to order the attack. The brief quiet that had resulted from the explosion of the Orient was broken by Franklins guns, and the battle resumed. She fought for another hour, but by then she had lost her <b>main</b> <b>and</b> mizzenmasts, nearly all of her cannons had been knocked out, and over half her crew were dead or wounded. She finally struck her colours.|$|E

5|$|Imperator Nikolai I {{had four}} Curtiss-AEG <b>main</b> <b>and</b> two {{auxiliary}} turbo generators with each driving two dynamos, one each {{for alternating current}} and direct current. Each main generator was rated at 360 kilowatts while the auxiliaries had a capacity of 200 kilowatts each. These powered the complex electrical system that combined alternating current for most equipment with direct current for heavy-load machinery like the turret motors. No diesel generators were provided.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the B began {{a project}} to raise the tracks of the New Hampshire <b>Main</b> <b>and</b> the {{southern}} end of the Woburn Branch for a mile through Winchester, eliminating a troublesome grade crossing downtown. Boxy two-story brick stations opened at Wedgemere and Winchester Center in 1957. The ticket office in the new station was closed in 1960 after just three years in service; thereafter, passengers bought tickets on the train. The station building hosted a coffee shop from 2008 to 2014.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-2000s, {{the route}} was reconfigured in the {{northern}} part of Medina to use <b>Main</b> <b>and</b> Commercial streets instead of Center Street and Prospect Avenue. The change was made as part of a village project known as the Pass Thru Project, and the realignment eliminated a three-block overlap with the easternmost part of NY31E on Center Street. Ownership and maintenance of NY63's former alignment was transferred from the state to the village on July1, 2010, as part of a highway maintenance swap that gave Commercial Street and the northernmost block of Main Street to the state.|$|E

5|$|<b>Main</b> <b>and</b> Hesse {{found that}} most of the mothers of these {{children}} had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.|$|E
