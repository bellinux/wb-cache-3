40|$|Miniaturisation {{of parts}} is {{emerging}} as an important approach to satisfy modern industrial and customer needs. Micro milling {{is one of the}} basic micromachining technologies used toproduce <b>miniaturised</b> <b>components.</b> It differs from conventional machining in that the handling and machining of very small features generates various problems. As a consequence, designers need to consider such problems during design to make micromilling more feasible.

40|$|A {{facility}} for rapid prototyping of MEMS devices {{is crucial for}} the development of novel <b>miniaturised</b> <b>components</b> in all sectors of high-tech industry, e. g. telecommunications, information technology, micro-optics and aerospace. To overcome the disadvantages of existing techniques in terms of cost and flexibility, a new approach has been taken to provide a tool for rapid prototyping and small-scale production: Complex CAD/CAM software has been developed that automatically generates the tool paths according to a CAD drawing of the MEMS device. As laser ablation is a much more complicated process than mechanical machining, for which such software has already been in use for many years, the generation of these tool paths relies not only on geometric considerations, but also on a sophisticated simulation module taking into account various material and laser parameters and micro-effects. The following laser machining options have been implemented: cutting, hole drilling, slot cutting, 2 D area clearing, pocketing and 2 D surface machining. Once the tool paths are available, a post processor translates this information into CNC commands that control a scanner head. This scanner head then guides the beam of a UV solid-state laser to machine the desired structure by direct laser ablation...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The growing demand in portable and compact consumer devices and appliances {{has resulted in the}} need for the miniaturisation of electronic <b>components.</b> These <b>miniaturised</b> electronic <b>components</b> are sensitive and susceptible to damage by voltages as low as 20 V. Electrically conductive styrenic thermoplastics are widely used in electronic packaging applications to protect these sensitive electronic components against electro-static discharge (ESD) during manufacturing, assembly, storage and shipping. Such ESD applications often require the optimal volume resistance range of ≥ 1. 0 x 105 to < 1. 0 x 108 Ω. The best known method to render styrenic thermoplastics conductive is by the incorporation of conductive fillers, such as carbon black but the main limitation is the difficulty in controlling the conductivity level due to the steep percolation curve. Thus the aim of this research is to develop electrically conductive styrenic thermoplastics by blending several styrenic resins with polymeric conductive additives to achieve optimal volume resistance range for ESD applications with the ease in controlling the conductivity level.

40|$|In the {{majority}} of microwave receiving and transmitting systems, a requirement {{is to have a}} filter immediately adjacent to the antenna or antenna array. This thesis presents a new methodology for antenna design where a filter is either fully or partially integrated with the antenna elements. The design of this antenna-filter follows the well-established coupled-resonator filter design theory, in which each resonator can not only be used as a filter element but also as a radiator. In order to verify the concept, a two-port bandpass filter designed using dipole antennas is the first work in this thesis to verify the use of dipole antennas as resonators. The coupling matrix has been used to obtain the filter response. One port antenna-filters made out of one, two and three dipoles. The method has also been utilised to implement X-band waveguide components which consist of an antenna-filter, antenna power divider and an antenna-diplexer. The calculation, simulation and measurement results are in good agreement. These proposed components has been designed, simulated, fabricated and measured.

First a description of four components, all integral parts of the cold gas micropropulsion system custom designed for the Prisma satellites (launched June 2010). One {{of the most complex}} <b>miniaturised</b> micropropulsion <b>components</b> on board Prisma is the MEMS thruster chip, comprising four microthrusters integrated in a six-silicon-wafer package weighing only 4 grams. Proportional MEMS thruster valves and internal gas heaters are key integral parts of the thruster chip, providing μN-to-mN thrust in four orthogonal directions. Other MEMS components on Prisma are: a MEMS isolation valve, a MEMS pressure relief valve, and a MEMS pressure sensor.

40|$|<b>Miniaturised</b> ultra-precision <b>components</b> are {{in great}} demand in micro/nano {{electro-mechanical}} systems, whose surface features are generally intricate and of nanometric dimensions. Since milling has high machining accuracy, simplicity, environment-friendliness and capability of generating complex and ultra-precision features, nano-milling {{has been considered}} a promising technique for efficient fabrications of components with nanometric features. However, the critical challenge is that the fundamental material removal mechanisms for nano-milling are still unclear, due to the difficulties in nano-scale experiments. This thesis has conducted a systematic investigation into the nano-milling of single crystal copper {{with the aid of}} molecular dynamics analysis. The following are the main findings and conclusions: 1. The Morse potential with compensation scaling can be used to reliably describe Cu-Cu interactions with both simulation accuracy and efficiency. A suitable integration time step for the simulation of copper, comprehensively determined by the algorithm constraint and bond-distance dynamics, has been identified to be within the range of 4 fs to 12 fs. 2. Single crystal copper is sensitive to the rotational speed of a nano-milling tool. The resultant threshold cutting speed should be 2, 062 m/s. 3. The crystallographic orientation effect of single crystal copper has been identified through nano-scratching. The material coefficient has been found to vary with cutting directions. 4. A chip removal criterion has been established according to the contact length of the macro-scale. 5. Stress waves have been found to propagate along the directions in 45 degree with the feeding direction of nano-milling and they can influence the minimum mid-wall thickness in a multi-grooving process. 6. The quality of both single- and multi-grooving processes has been investigated by analysing the residual shear stresses around the grooves, shear strain rate variation and stress wave propagation. The study reveals that the machining mechanisms of end milling and peripheral milling at the nano-scale are fairly similar. The depth of cut is critical to the groove quality from a single-milling path. Due to the minimisation of the surface energy, the groove geometry cannot be perfect, and the geometry distortion can spread to a depth of seven atomic layers. 7. It has been discovered that both the depth of cut and mid-wall thickness {{play a significant role in}} multiple grooving. The minimum mid-wall thickness in sequential grooving is determined by the highest residual shear stress inside the workpiece. For simultaneous grooving, strain rate and highest shear stress play important roles in Method-B (with opposite rotational orientations) and Method-A (with the same rotational orientation), respectively. 8. Dimensional analyses are preformed to generalise the simulation results, and dimensionless nano-milling charts are then constructed to guide the selection of nano-milling parameters based on grooving efficiency and quality...|$|R
40|$|Most modern aircraft, such as missile {{systems and}} {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles have limited size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C) capability. As the defence budget for military forces {{such as the}} UK and US continue to shrink, the emphasis on SWaP-C continues to strengthen. Military forces require smart weapons capable of precision strike, with a priority on safety. System manufacturers understand these requirements and limitations, and in response, develop <b>miniaturised</b> systems and <b>components</b> and also aim to consolidate these, into a single miniaturised solution. The growth of remotely operated aircraft, offers an ever present need for better, cheaper imaging systems. In general, sensors and seekers {{tend to be the}} biggest contribution to the cost and weight of an aircraft. Often, multiple imaging systems are needed dependent on the operational requirements. In this thesis, a novel dual field-of-view imaging system/seeker is proposed, which uses a single imaging sensor to superimpose both a wide field-of-view and a narrow field-of-view image of the same scene, co-boresighted. This allows multiple operational requirements to function simultaneously. The wide field-of-view allows for continuous monitoring and surveillance of an area, whilst the narrow field-of-view enables target detection, identification and tracking capabilities. Secondly, this thesis proposes a novel image separation technique to facilitate the separation of the superimposed imagery, using only the geometric relationship between the two different field-of-views. The separation technique is then extended to operate over sequential frames (i. e. video), and to function with fixed cameras that exhibit (un) desired camera motions, such as vibrations or "jitter". The image quality of the separation technique is broadly analysed over a range of images with varying image characteristics and properties. A novel image quality metric (IQM) was also proposed in this thesis, and was used to analyse the image quality of the recovered images, and its performance compared to already available IQMs. Finally, the separation technique is enhanced to operate with motion cameras, which exhibit motions such as pan, tilt, zoom and rotate etc. The separation technique, in most cases, was found to provide image recovery, comparable to current image enhancement techniques, and moreover, found to be far more robust to errors in registration, compared to current techniques. Initial hardware designs for the dual field-of-view imaging system, designed in conjunction with Prof. Andy Harvey from the University of Glasgow and Dr. James Babbington from Qioptiq Ltd., a lens design and manufacturing company, has also been presented...|$|R
