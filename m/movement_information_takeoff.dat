This paper proposes a novel shape-based movement-searching algorithm that can effectively search human movements in video streams. <b>Movement</b> <b>information</b> is represented a sequence of boundary shapes of human subjects extracted from input video frames. Information on individual shapes in the sequence is converted into a 1 D shape feature by using a shape descriptor. Human movements can be identified in a sequence of shape features extracted from the video, {{as in the case of}} searching for words in a long block of text. A comparison of the performance of the proposed algorithm with that of other methods shows that the proposed method can effectively describe human <b>movement</b> <b>information</b> and be useful for movement retrieval applications...|$|R

40|$|Most object {{tracking}} {{trees are}} established using the predefined mobility profile. However, {{when the real}} object's movement behaviors and query rates {{are different from the}} predefined mobility profile and query rates, the update cost and query cost of object tracking tree may increase. To upgrade the object tracking tree, the sink needs to send very large messages to collect the real <b>movement</b> <b>information</b> from the network, introducing a very large message overhead, which is referred to as adaptation cost. The Sub Root Message-Tree Adaptive procedure was proposed to dynamically collect the real <b>movement</b> <b>information</b> under the sub-tree and reconstruct the sub-tree to provide good performance based on the collected information. The simulation results indicates that the Sub Root Message-Tree Adaptive procedure is sufficient to achieve good total cost and lower adaptation cost...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we focus}} on the data {{management}} problem of object tracking applications in wireless sensor networks. We propose link-segment storage and query protocol to track mobile object in wireless sensor network dynamically. The main idea of our protocol is to combine advantages of local storage with data centric storage methods to support the query of object <b>movement</b> <b>information</b> efficiently. Object’s <b>movement</b> <b>information</b> will be stored in node near detecting sensor and the relation of storage nodes is maintained using multiple access entry linked list along the moving path of the object. Index-store node (a designated node) stores the access entry messages of linked list. Performance analysis and simulation studies show that the proposed protocol is energy efficient, with high probability of successful query and low query latency...|$|R

40|$|In a {{reproduction}} {{area where there}} are at least three directional groups, each of which has speakers, triggering of the speakers is achieved in that a source path from a first directional group position to a second directional group position is initially obtained along with <b>movement</b> <b>information</b> for the source path. Subsequently, a source path parameter is calculated for different points in time on the basis of the <b>movement</b> <b>information,</b> the source path parameter indicating a position of an audio source on the source path. In addition, a path modification command is received to define a compensation path to the third directional zone, a value of the source path parameter further being stored at a location where the compensation path deviates from the source path, and being used, along with a compensation parameter, for calculating weighting factors for the speakers of the three directional groups...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{analysis}} of disease risk, or disease mapping, typically relies on {{information about the}} residence and health status of individuals from population under study. However, residence information has its limitations because people are exposed to numerous disease risks as they spend time outside of their residences. Thanks to the wide-spread use of mobile phones and GPS-enabled devices, it is becoming possible to obtain a detailed record about the movement of human populations. Availability of <b>movement</b> <b>information</b> opens up an opportunity to improve the accuracy of disease mapping. Starting with an assumption that an individual’s disease risk is a weighted average of risks at the locations which were visited, we show that disease mapping {{can be accomplished by}} spatially regularized logistic regression. Due to the inherent sparsity of movement data, the proposed approach can be applied to large populations and over large spatial grids. In our experiments, we were able to map disease for a simulated population with 1. 6 million people and a spatial grid with 65 thousand locations in several minutes. The results indicate that <b>movement</b> <b>information</b> can improve the accuracy of disease mapping as compared to residential data only. We also studied a privacy-preserving scenario in which only the aggregate statistics are available about the movement of the overall population, while detailed <b>movement</b> <b>information</b> is available only for individuals with disease. The results indicate that the accuracy of disease mapping remains satisfactory when learning from movement data sanitized in this way...|$|R

40|$|How neural {{correlates}} of movements {{are represented in}} the human brain is of ongoing interest and has been researched with invasive and non-invasive methods. In this study, we analyzed the encoding of single upper limb movements in the time-domain of low-frequency electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Fifteen healthy subjects executed and imagined six different sustained upper limb movements. We classified these six movements and a rest class and obtained significant average classification accuracies of 55 % (movement vs movement) and 87 % (movement vs rest) for executed movements, and 27 % and 73 %, respectively, for imagined movements. Furthermore, we analyzed the classifier patterns in the source space and located the brain areas conveying discriminative <b>movement</b> <b>information.</b> The classifier patterns indicate that mainly premotor areas, primary motor cortex, somatosensory cortex and posterior parietal cortex convey discriminative <b>movement</b> <b>information.</b> The decoding of single upper limb movements is specially interesting {{in the context of}} a more natural non-invasive control of e. g., a motor neuroprosthesis or a robotic arm in highly motor disabled persons...|$|R
40|$|Underlying each stock trades {{hundreds}} of options at different strike prices and maturities. The order flows from these option transactions reveal important {{information about the}} underlying stock price. How to aggregate the trade information of different option contracts underlying the same stock presents an interesting and important question for developing microstructure theories and price discovery mechanisms in the derivatives markets. This paper takes options on QQQQ, the Nasdaq 100 tracking stock, as an example and examines different order flow consolidation mechanisms {{in terms of their}} effectiveness in extracting information about the underlying stock price and volatility movements.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in adopting electronic animal identification services at livestock markets. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) has provided broad recognition of the need for, and supplied momentum for development of, premises registration and associated animal identification systems. Furthermore, specialized marketing programs that target beef products to particular customer markets, especially export trade, are increasingly requiring individual animal identification. Livestock markets are a major center for cattle trade as 80 percent of feeder cattle sales occur through local auction markets or video auctions. For disease tracing and control reasons, animal identification systems become especially important at the time cattle are marketed. When an animal leaves its farm or ranch of origin is when recording individual animal identification and <b>movement</b> <b>information</b> begins. Thus, {{it is likely that}} livestock auctions will be a primary industry segment where animal identification and <b>movement</b> <b>information</b> is electronically recorded. Because of the high percentage of cattle marketed through livestock markets, electronic individual animal identification scanning may be an important addition at auction facilities...|$|R
