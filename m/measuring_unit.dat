25|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} the present name of the city can be dated back to the period of Ammaraja–I (922-929 CE), the Vengi Eastern Chalukyan King. It also has its appearance in another two inscriptions dated 1147AD and 1158AD. In Sanskrit, the name of Guntur was referred as Garthapuri. Garthapuri or Guntlapuri translates to a place surrounded by water ponds. The settlement might have been near a pond (gunta in telugu) and hence, gunta uru refers to pond village. Another one refers to kunta (land <b>measuring</b> <b>unit)</b> which transformed to kunta uru and later to Guntur.|$|E

First we encounter them at school and later on we incorporate them in everyday life, while many people use them in their professions. The aim of this project was to bring closer to students and teachers the teaching contents of <b>measuring</b> <b>units.</b> I wished to give new views and understandings {{of the contents of}} the measurements as well as using <b>measuring</b> <b>units</b> at school and everyday life. In addition, I wished to improve and refresh the students knowledge of converting {{units of measurement}} through the teaching approach and didactic games. There were three main stages of the project: initially I tested students existing knowledge of <b>measuring</b> <b>units.</b> Based on these results I designed the study approach using didactic games to encourage students understanding of units of measurement and refresh their knowledge. In the third part the students were given the second test of their knowledge, which was used to evaluate their progress. There was 23 students 4 th graders' from primary school Škofljica included in this study. Analysis of the test results and study approaches showed that students have most problems with converting <b>measuring</b> <b>units</b> for mass and time and least problems with converting units of money.

Unfortunately, confusion arises for such workers due to the existence of meters that don't contain tidy pairings of single potential measuring units with single current measuring units.
