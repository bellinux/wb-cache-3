40|$|Animal {{by-products}} (ABP) Category 3 includes hatchery waste, {{and also}} slaughterhouse waste and manure, aimed {{for use in}} biogas production. In order {{to be used as}} fertilisers, they must be sanitised to reduce pathogenic microorganisms. The initial European regulations regarding processing standards for ABP intended for use in e. g. biogas plants (EC No. 1774 / 2002) stipulated thermal treatment at 70 °C for 60 min. A subsequent amendment (EC No. 208 / 2006) stated that a validated treatment process may be used if it can show a reduction in thermo-resistant viruses of at least 3 log 10, whenever deamed a risk. Thermal treatments of biogas substrate at 70 °C and at 55 °C, using porcine parvovirus and swine vesicular disease virus, were performed. As a chemical sanitisation process regarding hatchery waste, ammonia inactivation was tested using the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H 7 N 1 and the low pathogenic avian influenza virus H 5 N 3. Models for other avian pathogenic ssRNA viruses were bovine parainfluenza virus 3, feline calicivirus and feline coronavirus. As possible indicators for monitoring virus inactivation, bacteriophages MS 2, ΦX 174, and 28 b were evaluated. Thermal treatment at 70 °C for 60 min inactivated porcine parvovirus by 2. 6 log 10, while phage 28 b was unaffected. Swine vesicular disease virus was undetectable after 30 min. Using too thermostable viruses as models for sufficient virus reduction in thermal treatments regarding Category 3 ABP materials and <b>manure</b> <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> biogas or composting plants, according to EU regulations, would make demands on other time-temperature combinations very strict. All viruses tested were efficiently inactivated by ammonia treatment in hatchery waste, while phage ΦX 174 proved too conservative to be used as indicator. Using phage MS 2 as a stable indicator to monitor a 3 log 10 reduction of ssRNA virus showed that addition of 0. 5 % w/w ammonia is required, followed by storage for at least 31 h at ≥ 14 °C. In case of an outbreak of e. g. avian influenza, storage for two days at the same conditions was estimated...|$|E
