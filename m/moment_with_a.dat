25|$|The {{magnetic}} {{structure of}} a-hematite {{was the subject}} of considerable discussion and debate in the 1950s because it appeared to be ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of around 1000 K, but with an extremely tiny magnetic moment (0.002 µB). Adding to the surprise was a transition with a decrease in temperature at around 260 K to a phase with no net magnetic moment. It was shown that the system is essentially antiferromagnetic, but that the low symmetry of the cation sites allows spin–orbit coupling to cause canting of the moments when they are in the plane perpendicular to the c axis. The disappearance of the <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> decrease in temperature at 260 K is caused by a change in the anisotropy which causes the moments to align along the c axis. In this configuration, spin canting does not reduce the energy. The magnetic properties of bulk hematite differ from their nanoscale counterparts. For example, the Morin transition temperature of hematite decreases with a decrease in the particle size. The suppression of this transition has also been observed in some of the hematite nanoparticles, and the presence of impurities, water molecules and defects in the crystals were attributed to the absence of a Morin transition. Hematite is part of a complex solid solution oxyhydroxide system having various contents of water, hydroxyl groups and vacancy substitutions that affect the mineral's magnetic and crystal chemical properties. Two other end-members are referred to as protohematite and hydrohematite.|$|E

Sachs here denies the Will in its supposedly most insistent form, that of sexual love. Wagner marks this <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> direct musical and textual reference to Tristan und Isolde: [...] ("My child, I know a sad tale of Tristan and Isolde. Hans Sachs was clever {{and did not want}} anything of King Marke's lot.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogen {{chloride}} is a diatomic molecule, {{consisting of}} a hydrogen atom H and a chlorine atom Cl connected by a polar covalent bond. The chlorine atom is much more electronegative than the hydrogen atom, which makes this bond polar. Consequently, the molecule has a large dipole <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> negative partial charge (δ−) at the chlorine atom and a positive partial charge (δ+) at the hydrogen atom. In part because of its high polarity, HCl is very soluble in water (and in other polar solvents). It is polar covalent instead of Ionic because the differences in hydrogen and chlorines electronegativity is small enough that a complete ionic bond doesn't form. Any electronegativity between [...]6 and 1.67 creates a polar covalent bond.|$|E

2500|$|To {{explain the}} {{establishment}} of syntactical speech, Richman cites English [...] "I wanna go home". He imagines this to have been learned {{in the first instance}} not as a combinatorial sequence of free-standing words, but as a single stuck-together combination— the melodic sound people make to express [...] "feeling homesick". Someone might sing [...] "I wanna go home", prompting other voices to chime in with [...] "I need to go home", [...] "I'd love to go home", [...] "Let's go home" [...] and so forth. Note that one part of the song remains constant, while another is permitted to vary. If this theory is accepted, syntactically complex speech began evolving as each chanted mantra allowed for variation at a certain point, allowing for the insertion of an element from some other song. For example, while mourning during a funeral rite, someone might want to recall a memory of collecting honey with the deceased, signalling this at an appropriate <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fragment of the [...] "we're collecting honey" [...] song. [...] Imagine that such practices became common. Meaning-laden utterances would now have become subject to a distinctively linguistic creative principle— that of recursive embedding.|$|E
