50|$|Unity is a {{graphical}} shell for the GNOME desktop environment {{originally developed}} by Canonical Ltd. for its Ubuntu operating system. Unity debuted in the netbook edition of Ubuntu 10.10. It was initially {{designed to make}} more efficient use of space given the limited screen size of netbooks, including, for example, a vertical application switcher called the launcher, and a space-saving horizontal multipurpose <b>top</b> <b>menu</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|R
25|$|In Visual Studio 2012 RC, a {{major change}} to the {{interface}} {{is the use of}} all-caps menu bar, as part of the campaign to keep Visual Studio consistent with the direction of other Microsoft user interfaces, and to provide added structure to the <b>top</b> <b>menu</b> <b>bar</b> area. The redesign was criticized for being hard to read, and going against the trends started by developers to use CamelCase to make words stand out better. Some speculated that the root cause of the redesign was to incorporate the simplistic look and feel of Metro apps. However, there exists a Windows Registry option to allow users to disable the all-caps interface.|$|R
50|$|Windows 2000 {{comes with}} two {{utilities}} to edit the Windows registry, REGEDIT.EXE and REGEDT32.EXE. REGEDIT has been directly ported from Windows 98, and therefore {{does not support}} editing registry permissions. REGEDT32 has the older multiple document interface (MDI) and can edit registry permissions {{in the same manner}} that Windows NT's REGEDT32 program could. REGEDIT has a left-side tree view of the Windows registry, lists all loaded hives and represents the three components of a value (its name, type, and data) as separate columns of a table. REGEDT32 has a left-side tree view, but each hive has its own window, so the tree displays only keys and it represents values as a list of strings. REGEDIT supports right-clicking of entries in a tree view to adjust properties and other settings. REGEDT32 requires all actions to be performed from the <b>top</b> <b>menu</b> <b>bar.</b> Windows XP is the first system to integrate these two programs into a single utility, adopting the REGEDIT behavior with the additional NT features.|$|R
30|$|Contrary to {{previous}} research results for CC, a <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> effect didn’t occur for the specimens studied, both CC and SCC. In fact, for all specimens except the NSCC specimens, the <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> had higher bond strength than the bottom bars, {{which may have}} been due to the very low w/c ratios (0.37 and 0.24 for the normal and high strength mixes, respectively) and the use of fly ash in the high strength mixes. In addition, the beams were not overly deep and were only slightly above the cutoff for when to consider <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> effects. These factors may have resulted in a decrease in the amount of bleed water accumulating beneath the <b>top</b> <b>bars,</b> which is the primary cause of the <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> effect. Some previous studies have also found a decrease in the <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> effect for SCC (Dehn et al. 2000; Chan et al. 2003; Castel et al. 2006; Valcuende and Parra 2009), while others have not (Turk et al. 2008; Castel et al. 2010). Due to the limited number of <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> specimens used in this study—one for each concrete type—further research is needed to reach a definitive conclusion.|$|R

5000|$|A {{growing number}} of amateur beekeepers are {{adopting}} various top-bar hives similar to the type commonly found in Africa. <b>Top</b> <b>bar</b> hives were originally used as a traditional beekeeping method in Greece and Vietnam with a history dating back over 2000 years. These hives have no frames and the honey-filled comb is not returned after extraction. Because of this, the production of honey {{is likely to be}} somewhat less than that of a frame and super based hive such as Langstroth or Dadant. <b>Top</b> <b>bar</b> hives are mostly kept by people who are more interested in having bees in their garden than in honey production per se. Some of the most well known top-bar hive designs are the Kenyan <b>Top</b> <b>Bar</b> Hive with sloping sides, the Tanzanian <b>Top</b> <b>Bar</b> Hive with straight sides, and Vertical <b>Top</b> <b>Bar</b> Hives, such as the Warre or [...] "People's Hive" [...] designed by Abbe Warre in the mid-1900s.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, IHAB {{introduced}} {{their first}} {{development of a}} <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> hive. The product was designed {{to make it easier}} and more convenient for an average person to raise bees. The <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> hive has the convenience of being usable in backyards or on city terraces.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{important}} to give the bees a clear starting point to build comb on each <b>top</b> <b>bar.</b> Some TBH beekeepers fashion their <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> with a V-shaped bottom to guide the comb building. Alternatively, some use a table saw to cut two closely spaced slots along the long axis of each new <b>top</b> <b>bar.</b> Either type of guide, wax line or grooves, gives bees a place {{to hold on to}} with their hooked feet. This allows a substantial [...] "drape" [...] of bees to form, which is the beginning of comb building.|$|R

50|$|Medals {{that are}} {{intended}} to be hung from a ribbon also include a small suspension piece at the crest with which to loop a suspension ring through. It is through the ring that a ribbon is run or folded so the medal may hang pendent. Medals pinned to the breast use only a small cut of ribbon that {{is attached to a}} <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> where the brooch pin is affixed. <b>Top</b> <b>bars</b> may be hidden under the ribbon so they are not visible, be a plain device from which the ribbon attaches, or may even be decorative to complement the design on the medal. Some <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> are elaborate and contain a whole design unto themselves.|$|R

50|$|The {{angle of}} the sloped sides is most {{commonly}} recommended to be 30 degrees. The width of the <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> {{is the sum of}} comb thickness and one measure of beespace. This helps ensure that bees build exactly one comb per <b>top</b> <b>bar.</b> Most top-bar hive plans freely available on the internet show hives of roughly 1 meter long and between 30 cm and 50 cm wide and high.|$|R
50|$|CNBC Asia {{also uses}} a two-line ticker of similar design to the Europe feed's ticker. Early in the morning, the <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> {{features}} the listed stocks from major market indexes from New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq (DOW 30 and NASDAQ 100), {{as well as}} pre-trade stocks from stock exchanges across Asia-Pacific. As the Asian trading day begins, the <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> generally provides the most actively traded shares in the region where each country's stock data will be reflected once a given market opens. Exceptions to this are on CNBC's Singapore and Australian feeds, in which the <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> exclusively features stock information for their respective local stock markets. The bottom bar provides market indices, currencies, bonds and commodity prices.|$|R
5000|$|A {{beekeeper}} {{can make}} <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> from any plain wood. The <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> are usually 1¼ inches to 1⅜ inches (32-35 mm) wide, depending on local {{conditions and the}} type of bee to be housed. Combs can be handled individually. The depth of the bar and the length of the bar can be whatever the beekeeper wants, but usually between 17" [...] and 20". The depth of the <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> hive should be 12" [...] or less. If deeper, the weight of the comb filled with honey tends to cause it to fall off the bar {{into the bottom of the}} hive. The bees will lose access to this during the winter cluster in the hanging combs, thus increasing their likelihood of starving.|$|R

50|$|CNBC TV18 uses a two-line ticker {{seven days}} a week, 24 hours a day (smaller during commercials). As the NSE trading day begins at 8:00, the <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> {{provides}} the large cap stocks, and bottom bar shows midcap stocks. From 18:00 (IST), the ticker shows the news headlines at the top, and at the bottom all NSE stocks.

50|$|The hive body of {{a common}} style of top-bar hive is often shaped as an {{inverted}} trapezoid {{in order to reduce}} the tendency of bees to attach the comb to the hive-body walls, though this reasoning has become less popular recently. It may be more likely that the trapezoid shape helps to improve the ratio of the weight of the comb to the amount of attachment at the bar and helps to lessen the likelihood of heavy combs detaching from the <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> when being handled or harvested. Unlike the Langstroth design, this style of top-bar hive is expanded horizontally, not vertically. The top-bar design is a single, much longer box, with the bars hanging in parallel. This common style is sometimes referred to as a horizontal <b>Top</b> <b>Bar</b> hive, or hTBH. Most horizontal <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> hives in the UK are based on the tandem-follower system designed by Phil Chandler.|$|R
