A developer with frequent needs to mitigate for losses associated with Section 404 and Section 10 requirements may, using a <b>mitigation</b> bank, consolidate <b>mitigation</b> and in so doing, potentially reduce <b>mitigation</b> costs. As a result of route maintenance, as well as expansion requirements, ports were considered to be good candidates for sponsoring <b>mitigation</b> bank efforts.

This thesis supports the hypothesis that the number of <b>mitigation</b> banks has grown significantly since 1988, when the last inventory of <b>mitigation</b> banks in the U. S. had been conducted. This growth can be attributed largely to the increase in the number of department of transportation-sponsored banks.

40|$|Tradeoffs are {{examined}} between mitigating black carbon (BC) {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) for limiting peak global mean warming, using the following set of methods. A two-box climate model is used to simulate temperatures of the atmosphere and ocean for different rates of <b>mitigation.</b> <b>Mitigation</b> rates for BC and CO 2 are characterized by respective timescales for e-folding reduction in emissions intensity of gross global product. There are respective emissions models that force the box model. Lastly there is a simple economics model, with cost of <b>mitigation</b> varying inversely with emission intensity. Constant <b>mitigation</b> timescale corresponds to <b>mitigation</b> at a constant annual rate, for example an e-folding timescale of 40 years corresponds to 2. 5 % reduction each year. Discounted present cost depends only on respective <b>mitigation</b> timescale and respective <b>mitigation</b> cost at present levels of emission intensity. Least-cost <b>mitigation</b> is posed as choosing respective e-folding timescales, to minimize total <b>mitigation</b> cost under a temperature constraint (e. g. within 2 degrees C above preindustrial). Peak warming is more sensitive to <b>mitigation</b> timescale for CO 2 than for BC. Therefore rapid <b>mitigation</b> of CO 2 emission intensity is essential to limiting peak warming, but simultaneous <b>mitigation</b> of BC can reduce total <b>mitigation</b> expenditure.

Utilizing agency permit files, wetland impacts and required <b>mitigation</b> were analyzed for the years 1983 - 1991. Field evaluations were conducted to determine the actual area of wetland impacts and completion of required <b>mitigation</b> as permitted by FDER. <b>Mitigation</b> areas were evaluated based upon a set of criteria developed for this study. A total of 82 permits were reviewed, resulting in the evaluation of 30 completed <b>mitigation</b> areas. Results indicate that freshwater wetlands containing both forested and marsh areas were permitted for the largest impact and were impacted the most by project activities. However, mangroves comprised the largest area of required <b>mitigation</b> while freshwater forested areas composed the largest area of completed <b>mitigation.</b> The largest impact to the county 2 ̆ 7 s wetlands occurred in 1986 and the most <b>mitigation</b> was required in 1987.
