500|$|In {{reviewing}} Epiphany 2.30 in July 2010 Jack Wallen {{described it}} as [...] "efficient, but different" [...] and noted its problem with crashes. [...] "When I first started working with Epiphany it crashed on most sites I visited. After doing a little research (and then a little debugging) I realized the issue was with JavaScript. Epiphany (in its current release), for some strange reason, doesn't like JavaScript. The only way around this was to disable JavaScript. Yes this means a lot of features won't work {{on a lot of}} sites – but this also means those same sites will load faster and won't be so prone to having issues (like crashing my browser)." [...] Wallen concluded positively about the browser, [...] "Although Epiphany hasn't fully replaced Chrome and Firefox as my one-stop-shop browser, I now use it <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> would have previously. [...] small footprint, fast startup, and clean interface." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Science Squad are a {{group of}} fictional {{scientists}} and mad scientists in the DC Comics Universe. The group was created by writer Grant Morrison who stated, [...] "I love writing cowardly, petulant, irascible supervillains <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> enjoy writing truly evil ones, so this whole plot strand was a joy from beginning to end." [...] The {{members of the team}} are Veronica Cale, Doctor Death, Doctor Sivana, I.Q., Will Magnus, T.O. Morrow, Komrade Krabb, Dr. Tyme, and Robby Reed enemies Doctor Cyclops, Baron Bug, and Dr. Rigoro Mortis. They are commanded by Chang Tzu. They are featured prominently throughout the series, particularly in Week 46.|$|E
2500|$|When {{war broke}} out again in May 1803, Fox blamed the Prime Minister Henry Addington for not {{standing}} up to the King. The British government had not left Napoleon [...] "any alternative but War or the most abject humiliation" [...] and that the war [...] "is entirely the fault of our Ministers and not of Bonaparte". Upon hearing of the spectacular French victories at Ulm and Austerlitz later in 1805, Fox commented: [...] "These are wonders indeed but they are not <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> expected". When Pitt (who had taken over from Addington as premier in 1804) tried to persuade Prussia into an anti-French alliance, Prussia refused, to Fox's delight.|$|E

2500|$|East Carolina {{was heavily}} {{favored to win}} the game, {{including}} predictions from all six CBS Sports panelists, ESPN writers, Bleacher Report, and Dr. Saturday, a feature from Yahoo Sports, [...] as Ohio had fallen apart {{in the latter half}} of the season, and ECU's offense was very explosive offensively. One Yahoo Sports preview commented that it was a strength on strength game: [...] "It's a game of strength vs. strength. East Carolina's passing attack is ranked 11th in the country at 331 yards per game. Ohio has given up 212 passing yards per game. The Bobcats are much worse against the run, but East Carolina runs the ball poorly. The Pirates are 101st in the nation in rushing offense ... I like ECU's strength <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> like Ohio's strength." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{referring}} to the bequest of the Outhwaite family and making placatory remarks about the Marist Brothers, Liston welcomed the Christian Brothers. He {{said that they were}} [...] "here at the invitation of the Bishop to take charge of St Peter's school and to have their part, along with the Marist Brothers and other religious communities, in our Catholic education system. They have their own traditions to give us, formed in the society's work of teaching since 1802, and the fruit of the experience gathered, to speak only of Australia and New Zealand, of over 500 Brothers teaching more than 20,000 boys". Liston added, [...] " ... if I know the Brothers at all, the boys under their care will be put to hard work - an excellent thing - and teachers will not do for them what they should do for themselves. The thought of the years ahead and of the eternal life will be regarded as of first importance. Teachers will feel it their daily duty to fit the boys to bear life's burdens with a spirit of nobility and to meet life's problems with unfaltering courage". At the conclusion of his speech, Bishop Liston said, [...] "This is a very happy day for me indeed for I owe <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> can say to the training I received {{at the hands of the}} Christian Brothers in Dunedin long years ago".|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not split {{words with}} me; {{you know what}} I mean; you feel what I mean; I mean <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> say, and you {{understand}} <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> say. My lord told me {{to ask you to}} dine with us, if you called, but I will not ask you. There is no joy in meeting at present. I feel as I felt in our last year at Hurstley." ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. Yes, very. But you're so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> pretty. <b>I</b> {{expect you}} have more brains in your little finger than she has in her whole body.|$|R
6000|$|Gilbert and Lucy both uttered an exclamation; and Sophy added, 'She {{would have}} so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{enjoyment}} <b>than</b> <b>I</b> could! Oh, it would quite {{make up for}} my missing it!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "On the contrary, it {{has been}} a succès fou. But I don't feel {{altogether}} easy in my mind about it. The fact is, they seem to print <b>much</b> <b>more</b> rubbish <b>than</b> <b>I</b> supposed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Camilla {{has been}} very kind in giving me <b>much</b> <b>more</b> freedom <b>than</b> <b>I</b> expected, and pacifying papa. She let me go every Friday evening to help Lady Susan Strangeways at her mothers' meeting." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, I--I believe it, now. But I can't see why. There {{must be so}} many {{attractive}} {{girls in}} the city, who know so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I could, if I wasn't {{afraid of}} uncle. He knows so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> do, he'd laugh," [...] began Geordie, evidently {{puzzled by the}} question.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place, {{the result of}} the {{experiment}} already tried has been so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> serious <b>than</b> <b>I</b> had anticipated, that I believe the end I had in view in making it has been answered already." ...|$|R
60|$|My comrades {{joined me}} as I saluted my father <b>much</b> <b>more</b> warmly <b>than</b> <b>I</b> {{might have done}} but for the unkind words I had spoken, {{and in a few}} seconds we heard all the story he could tell.|$|R
6000|$|... "My courage fails me at {{the thought}} of facing Diana's injured mother," [...] sighed Anne. [...] "I wish you'd go, Marilla. You're so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> dignified <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am. Likely she'd listen to you quicker than to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{leave it}} till tomorrow, doctor," [...] Desmond said faintly. [...] "There {{must be a}} number of poor fellows who want your {{attention}} <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> what <b>I</b> {{put in the}} message," [...] said the man. [...] "I saw the {{houseboat}} out yonder and headed in that direction. I was watching her when a fog came up and hid her from view." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And you {{are very}} {{different}}, too, M. Chapeau; <b>much</b> <b>more</b> different <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am; it's all your own fault; you choose to give yourself airs, and I won't put up with it, and I believe we may as well part." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why did {{you tell}} mamma you would not come? What {{nonsense}} {{to talk to her}} about frocks? Why not come and tell me? You used to have everything at Rome, <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> had." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, my man! I {{want you}} to. You know I'm terribly ambitious for you; <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am for myself. I just don't {{want you to}} forget poor Tanis. Will you call me up soon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [FN#4] I {{know better}} now. We have the dark powers <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> thought, {{but not as}} much as the Scottish, and yet I think the {{imagination}} of the people does dwell chiefly upon the fantastic and capricious.|$|E
50|$|Foxx is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{intelligent}} <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, better looking, better lit. A kind of naively perfected entity.
