This paper describes an implementation {{of such a}} <b>distributed</b> <b>frame</b> buffer for the Intel Paragon routing network, and reports its performance results. We have conducted several experiments with the system we have developed. Our results indicate that placing a multipleport, <b>distributed</b> <b>frame</b> buffer directly on the host internal routing network can provide high throughput to eliminate the bottleneck of merging a final image from multiple processors to a frame buffer. This architectural approach can also effectively support image composition for sort-last. The synchronization algorithm we have developed requires only one-way communication and minimizes receive overhead for message passing to the frame buffer...|$|R

This paper proposes two new accordion-type shelters that use modified geometries to improve on the structural stability and stiffness of the typical accordion form. The first shelter is termed a <b>distributed</b> <b>frame</b> accordion shelter and is generated by separating fully folded accordion frames between spacer plates aligned with the transverse direction. A transverse stiffness and increased flexural rigidity can therefore be achieved while maintaining a nonzero floor area. The second shelter is termed a diamond wall accordion shelter and is generated by inserting secondary wall elements that increase wall sectional depth and counteract the coupled rotational-transverse displacements at accordion roof–wall junctions. For both shelter types, a geometric parameterization and a full-scale prototype are presented. Good correlation is seen between the designed and constructed surfaces. A numerical investigation also shows that the new forms have substantially increased flexural rigidities compared to the typical accordion for...|$|R

40|$|Distributed {{denial of}} service is {{a major threat to}} the {{availability}} of Internet services. The distributed, large scale nature of the Internet, makes DDoS attacks stealthy and difficult to counter. Defense against Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks is one of the hardest security problems on the Internet. Recently, these network attacks have been increasing. In order to cope with the increase, many ISP (Internet Service Provider) customers introduced IDSs (Intrusion Detection System). However, the IDSs cannot always detect the network attacks due to dropping the packets when DDoS packets are aggregated to the customer’s link. Attack packets can be identical to legitimate packets, since the attacker only needs volume, not content, to inflict damage. Furthermore, the volume of packets from individual sources can be low enough to escape notice by local administrators. Thus, a detection system based on single site will have either high positive or high negative rates. Therefore more effective countermeasures are required to counter the threat. This requirement has motivated us to propose a novel mechanism against DDoS attack. This study presents the design details of a distributed defense mechanism against DDoS attack. The DDoS attack cannot be addressed through isolated actions of defense nodes. The effectiveness of attack detection increases near the victim and the effectiveness of packet filtering increases near the attack source. So we choose the detection system in the intermediate location to get benefits in both ways. In our approach, the egress routers of the intermediate network coordinate with each other to provide the information necessary to detect and respond to the attack. In our distributed IDS system, there is a corresponding true positive ratio. In this <b>Distributed</b> <b>frame</b> work, the information and services are exchanged between systems through which they act together against the threat...|$|R
