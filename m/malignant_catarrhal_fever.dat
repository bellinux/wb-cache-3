40|$|AbstractMalignant <b>catarrhal</b> <b>fever</b> (MCF) is a fatal {{lymphoproliferative}} disease of cattle that, in East Africa, results from {{transmission of the}} causative virus, alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AlHV- 1), from wildebeest. A vaccine field trial involving an attenuated AlHV- 1 virus vaccine was performed over two wildebeest calving seasons on the Simanjiro Plain of northern Tanzania. Each of the two phases of the field trial consisted of groups of 50 vaccinated and unvaccinated cattle, which were subsequently exposed to AlHV- 1 challenge by herding toward wildebeest. Vaccination resulted in the induction of virus-specific and virus-neutralizing antibodies. Some cattle in the unvaccinated groups also developed virus-specific antibody responses but only {{after the start of}} the challenge phase of the trial. PCR of DNA from blood samples detected AlHV- 1 infection in both groups of cattle but the frequency of infection was significantly lower in the vaccinated groups. Some infected animals showed clinical signs suggestive of MCF but few animals went on to develop fatal MCF, with similar numbers in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. This study demonstrated a baseline level of MCF-seropositivity among cattle in northern Tanzania of 1 % and showed that AlHV- 1 virus-neutralizing antibodies could be induced in Tanzanian zebu shorthorn cross cattle by our attenuated vaccine, a correlate of protection in previous experimental trials. The vaccine reduced infection rates by 56 % in cattle exposed to wildebeest but protection from fatal MCF could not be determined due to the low number of fatal cases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMalignant <b>catarrhal</b> <b>fever</b> is a {{lymphoproliferative}} disease of cattle and other ungulates caused by infection with gamma-herpesviruses {{of the genus}} Macavirus. These viruses do not establish a productive infection but instead replicate in a cell-associated fashion in T lymphocytes, leading to systemic immune dysregulation and a generally fatal outcome. Despite significant progress in understanding the pathology of this disease, its pathogenesis remains unclear. To identify genes and pathways affected in clinical MCF, sixteen bovine GeneCHIP microarrays were used to assay RNA from kidney and lymph node of four MCF-affected and four control Bos taurus steers. This is the first expression study of AlHV- 1 -MCF in the bovine host. Over 250 genes showed significant changes in gene expression in either lymph node or kidney, while expression of 35 genes was altered in both tissues. Pathway and annotation analysis of the microarray data showed that immune response and inflammatory genes were up-regulated in the kidney while proliferation-associated transcripts were additionally increased in the lymph node. The genes that showed the largest expression rises in both diseased tissues included cytotoxic enzymes and pro-inflammatory chemokines. These data are consistent with disease-induced stimulation of inflammatory responses involving interferon-γ, including cytotoxic T cell recruitment and activation in peripheral tissues containing virus-infected cells. However it remains unclear whether the tissue damage in MCF lesions is due entirely to the activity of infected cells or whether uninfected T cells, recruited and activated at lesion sites through the action of infected cells, contribute to the pathogenesis of MCF...|$|R

Recently an attenuated vaccine (atAlHV- 1) was tested under experimental challenge on Friesian-Holstein (FH) cattle {{and gave a}} vaccine efficacy (VE) of approximately 90 %. However testing under field conditions on an East African breed, the shorthorn zebu cross (SZC), gave a VE of 56 % suggesting that FH and SZC cattle may respond differently to the vaccine. To investigate, a challenge trial was carried out using SZC. Additionally three adjuvant combinations were tested: (i) Emulsigen®, (ii) bacterial flagellin (FliC) and (iii) Emulsigen®+bacterial flagellin. We report 100 % seroconversion in all immunized cattle. The group inoculated with atAlHV- 1 +Emulsigen® had significantly higher antibody titres than groups inoculated with FliC, the smallest number of animals that became infected and the fewest fatalities, suggesting {{this was the most}} effective combination. A larger study is required to more accurately determine the protective effect of this regime in SZC. There was an apparent inhibition of the antibody response in cattle inoculated with atAlHV- 1 +FliC, suggesting FliC might induce an immune suppressive mechanism. The VE in SZC (50 – 60 %) was less than that in FH (80 – 90 %). We speculate that this might be due to increased risk of disease in vaccinated SZC (suggesting that the vaccine may be less effective at stimulating an appropriate immune response in this breed) and/or increased survival in unvaccinated SZC (suggesting that these cattle may have a degree of prior immunity against infection with AlHV- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Bluetongue Virus is {{the type}} species of the genus Orbivirus, within the family Reoviridae. Ovens are {{infected}} with the virus by certain species of biting midges (Culicoides) and BTV is the aetiologic agent of <b>catarrhal</b> <b>fever</b> or Bluetongue. Disease is cause of important economic losses for country involved in; this reason make us consider BTV as an emergency and for this is necessary to carry on studies {{in order to find}} out solutions for preventing and fighting his proliferation. The purpose of this work was the production of recombinant antigen in eterologous system from BTV serotype 2, that arrived in Sardinia into 2001, to use them as diagnostic and preventives tools of the disease. In order to obtain this result, virus has been isolated, identified as BTV serogroup and as serotype 2 of Corsican strain and a library of the viral DNA has been created. Two of virus’s genes (L 2 and S 7) have been cloned in bacterial system, sequenced and the protein codified from S 7, the VP 7, expressed in recombinant form, purified, and characterized with Immunoblotting and ELISA. Moreover, the S 7 gene was cloned into expression system for plants transformation. The attempts to stop disease with attenuated vaccines in 2000 get a lot of problems due to the virus reversion causing collateral effects as abortion and birth of lambs with physical deformity. At the moment, different attempts based on BTV sub unity for the production of recombinant vaccines have been done. They have been demonstrated extremely safe and effective in protecting sheep as they are suitable for DIVA diagnostic. Anyway, different inoculations are necessary for the tool efficacy as for inactivated vaccines and in addition the high production costs in conventional systems stop from their utilization in the prevent campaigns. A different way of work is to use plants as model of expression. Plants offer high expression level of proteins, in fact some vegetable organs cumulate a big quantity of proteins, moreover, it is very easy to increase or decrease the levels of production and the costs of production for recombinant vaccines in this system are cheapest. Protein’s antigenic properties product in plants could be tested in animals models. We hope this type of work will lead us to build up efficient disease controls system in the future...|$|R

50|$|Another set of {{problems}} to unfold for the Maasai was the rapid increase in population of the wildebeest.

Not only the exposure to a deadly disease affect the livestock, {{but also because of}} the large wildebeest population, grasses were hardly left for Maasai livestock to feed on. During the early 1970s, a stricter ban was placed on cultivation to where any cultivation within the NCA area became illegal. The Maasai's subsistence is dependent on the cultivation of grains, from which the Maasai would trade livestock with cultivators for grains. For twenty years, the Maasai endured a ban on cultivation, more restrictions on highland craters and the spread and increase in livestock disease. Because of the inability to cultivate, there was an increase in malnutrition and under nutrition among the children of the Maasai. It was not until the early 1990s that the ban on cultivation was lifted. After the lift of the ban, there was an increase in living for the Maasai. Malnutrition declined and sustainable living emerged. But because of the intense cultivation to support the population, conservationists are now reevaluating whether to allow cultivation to continue, so again, the faith of the Maasai are left in the hands of more policy making and restrictions in which none have a voice in.|$|E
5000|$|Unfortunately {{a vaccine}} for <b>malignant</b> <b>catarrhal</b> <b>fever</b> (MCF) {{has not yet}} been developed. [...] Developing a vaccine has been {{difficult}} because the virus will not grow in cell culture and until recently it was not known why. Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) found that the virus undergoes changes within the animal's body, a process known as [...] "cell tropism switching". In cell tropism switching, the virus targets different cells at different points in its life cycle. This phenomenon explains why it has been impossible to grow the virus on any one particular cell culture. Because the virus is transmitted from sheep to bison and cattle, researchers are first focusing on the viral life cycle in sheep. The viral life cycle is outlined in three stages: entry, maintenance, and shedding. Entry occurs through the sheep's nasal cavity and enters into the lungs where it replicates. The virus undergoes a tropic change and infects lymphocytes, also known as white blood cells, which {{play a role in the}} sheep's immune system. In the maintenance stage the virus remains on the sheep's lymphocytes and circulates the body. Finally, during the shedding stage, the virus undergoes another change and shifts its target cells from lymphocytes to nasal cavity cells, where it is then shed through nasal secretions. This discovery undoubtedly puts scientists on the right track for developing a vaccine - starting with the correct cell culture for each stage of the virus lifecycle - but ARS researchers are also looking into alternative methods to develop a vaccine. Researchers are experimenting with the MCF virus that infects topi (an African antelope) because it will grow in cell culture and does not infect cattle. Researchers hope that inserting genes from the sheep MCF virus into the topi MCF virus will ultimately be an effective MCF vaccine for cattle and bison. [...] While there is much ground left to cover, scientists are getting closer and closer to developing a vaccine.|$|E

40|$|Parvovirus B 19 (B 19) is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} the common childhood disease, erythema infectiosum (EI), also named fifth disease. About 50 % of humans are infected during childhood, but the virus is also transmitted to adults and about 80 % of the elderly are seropositive. Apart from asymptomatic infection, which is common, the clinical presentations in EI are usually slight <b>catarrhal</b> symptoms and <b>fever</b> followed by rash, typically intense on cheeks and later distributed on the extensor parts of legs and arms. For infected adults, the rash is less common, whereas the frequency of arthropathy, which may last for months or years, is about 50 %. The main replicative sites of the virus are erythropoetic cells, and anaemia is a well-known manifestation of the infection, especially in immunocompromised patients. Pregnant women,when infected, {{are at risk of}} spontaneous abortion, hydrops fetalis and, later in pregnancy, intrauterine fetal death. B 19 has also been associated with rheumatologic diseases, hepatitis, myocarditis and neurological manifestations. In 1993, we used PCR-technique and found B 19 DNA in the bone marrow (BM) of a patient with chronic fatigue, anaemia and leukopenia. Since then, we have followed her and other patients with chronic symptoms of fatigue, arthralgia and fever and found that some of them have persistent B 19 DNA in BM for years after primary infection. The prevalence of B 19 DNA in BM in the general population was not previously Imown To get a hint of the frequency, we tested the BM of 100 patients with haematological disorders, from whom BM samples were available, and in 4 % B 19 DNA PCR was positive. In the studied group, 59 % were B 19 IgG-positive and we concluded that B 19 DNA in BM is not a general finding in seropositive individuals. Arthropathy is a common manifestation of B 19 infection in adults and sometimes even meets the official criteria for rheumatoid arthritis. Consequently, the frequency of B 19 DNA in BM of rheumatic patients is of interest. We studied a group of 50 patients with various rheumatological diseases. B 19 DNA was found in 13 of 50 patients (26 %), a significantly higher level than in our previous study. Immunocompromised patients are susceptible to B 19 infection, but our hypothesis is that individuals, who are otherwise immunocompetent, may have a selective immune deficiency with respect to B 19 causing the virus to persist and evoke symptoms of chronic immunological stimulation. To confirm this hypothesis, we have studied patients with persistent B 19 DNA in BM with regard to general immunological parameters such as HLA-type, lymphocyte subpopulations and cytokine profiles. We also investigated the specific CD 8 T-cell response to B 19 antigens with an ELISpot assay for detecting IFNã production. Although the patients with persistent B 19 DNA in BM had no general, uniform immunological aberration, their B 19 specific cellular immune responses diverged from those of controls supporting our hypothesis of a selective immune deficienc...|$|R

PAGE Was first sown in Greece; next nurtured in Rome—Languished {{during the}} dark ages—Revived {{in the sixteenth}} century—Aided by the {{translation}} of the writings of Vegetius—The succeeding age still further cultivated it—The eighteenth century marked by veterinary writings of acknow- ledged merit, and by {{the establishment of the}} first public school of the art—The subsequent march of veterinary science may be legibly traced in the works of the many eminent authors who have since written on it. 1 — 4 SECTION II. HISTORY OF VETERINARY MEDICINE IN GREAT BRITAIN. Our first improvements were coupled with the arts of the menage borrowed from France and Germany—The early writings on the subject were mostly translations from the French—The English school was stimulated by the works of Sollysel, towards the middle of the last century; Great Britain also began to furnish native writers and eminent practitioners— History of the Veterinary College—A short sketch of the more promi- nent English writers on the subject [...] 4 — 6 SECTION III.
