40|$|BACKGROUND—This study {{evaluated}} {{the ability of}} laser scanning tomography to distinguish between normal and glaucomatous optic nerve heads, and between glaucomatous subjects with and without field loss.  METHODS— 57 subjects were classified into three diagnostic groups: subjects with elevated intraocular pressure, normal optic nerve heads, and normal visual fields (n= 10); subjects with glaucomatous optic neuropathy and normal visual fields (n= 30); and subjects with glaucomatous optic neuropathy and repeatable visual field abnormality (n= 17). Three 10  degree image series were acquired on each subject using the Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT). From the 14  HRT stereometric variables, three were selected a priori for evaluation: (1) volume above reference (neuroretinal rim volume), (2) third moment in contour (cup shape), and (3) height variation contour (variation in relative nerve fibre layer height at the disc margin). Data were analysed using analysis of covariance, with age as the covariate.  RESULTS—Volume above reference, third moment in contour, and mean height contour were significantly different between {{each of the three}} diagnostic groups (p< 0. 001). Height variation contour showed no significant difference among the three diagnostic groups (p= 0. 906).  CONCLUSIONS—The HRT variables <b>measuring</b> <b>rim</b> volume, cup shape, and mean nerve fibre layer height distinguished between (1) subjects with elevated intraocular pressures and normal nerve heads, and glaucomatous optic nerve heads, and (2) glaucomatous optic nerve heads with and without repeatable visual field abnormality. This study did not directly assess the ability of the HRT to identify patients at risk of developing glaucoma. It is hypothesised that the greatest potential benefit of laser scanning tomography will be in the documentation of change within an individual over time. ...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—Progressive loss of neuroretinal rim {{tissue is}} known to occur early in {{glaucoma}} and measurement of the neuroretinal rim area is possible by magnification corrected analysis of optic disc photographs (planimetry). This study was performed {{to determine whether the}} facility to distinguish between glaucomatous and normal optic discs could be improved upon by: (a) taking into account the known relation between optic disc size and neuroretinal rim area, and (b) <b>measuring</b> <b>rim</b> area in a number of segments, in order to detect focal changes.  METHODS—Planimetric examination of the optic disc photographs of 88  control subjects and 51  patients with early visual field defects was performed. In the control group, multiple linear regression analysis was performed between neuroretinal rim area and optic disc area, age, sex, eye side, refraction, and keratometry. This was repeated for the whole disc and for each of twelve 30  degree segments. Normal ranges were defined by the 98 % prediction intervals of the regression analysis and the sensitivity and specificity for correct identification of optic discs in the two groups determined.  RESULTS—Multiple linear regression demonstrated significant associations between the neuroretinal rim area and optic disc area and age in normal subjects. Sensitivity and specificity for glaucoma diagnosis, using the cut off derived from the 98 % prediction intervals, was 37. 7 % and 98. 9 % respectively when total neuroretinal rim area alone was considered, and 88. 7 % and 94. 3 % respectively when the 30  degree segments were included. The most frequent pattern of neuroretinal rim loss was diffuse, followed by thinning in more than one sector and then by thinning in the inferotemporal sector alone.  CONCLUSIONS—This method of optic disc analysis enables the examiner to identify glaucomatous optic discs at the stage of early perimetric loss {{with a high degree of}} precision. Optic disc photography is simple, and fundus cameras are widely available. This method for glaucoma case identification may therefore be suitable for the primary care setting as well as hospital practice.    Keywords: optic disc; glaucoma; case finding; imagin...|$|E

Methods: This prospective, interventional case series, includes 43 consecutive myopic eyes which were assessed on the day of PRK and 3 months postoperatively using the HRT 3. Among the stereometric parameters, we compared disc area, linear cup disc ratio, cup shape <b>measure,</b> global <b>rim</b> area, global rim volume, RNFL height variation contour and mean RNFL thickness; out of the Glaucoma Probability Score (GPS) we assessed changes in global value, rim steepness temporal/superior, and temporal/inferior, as well as cup size and cup depth before and after PRK. Results: Mean refractive error before and after PRK were − 3. 24 ± 1. 31 and − 0. 20 ± 0. 42 diopters, respectively. No significant change occurred in disc area, linear cup disc ratio, cup shape <b>measure,</b> <b>rim</b> area and rim volume among the stereometric parameters; and in rim steepness temporal/superior and rim steepness temporal/inferior in the GPS before and after PRK using the default average keratometry. However, RNFL height variation contour, mean RNFL thickness, and cup size and depth were significantly altered after PRK (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: PRK can affect some HRT 3 parameters.

This research {{aimed to develop}} a conceptual framework for consideration of RT-access, examine factors perceived to impact on RT-access and RT-utilisation, define RT-inconvenience, determine its impact on RT-utilisation and develop a measure to quantify it. Methods An RT-access framework was constructed and used to examine (qualitatively and quantitatively) factors influencing RT-utilisation. The impact of RT-inconvenience on uptake of breast conserving treatment (using RT) was determined in a population of early breast cancer patients. The initial phase of development of the RT-Inconvenience <b>Measure</b> (<b>RIM)</b> was undertaken. Results RT-access requires RT-opportunity (availability, affordability, adequacy and acceptability) and its translation to RT-utilisation. Several factors affect the latter. These include perceptions of RT, its benefit and its side effects (risks, management and impact), fear and anxiety about RT, travel, accommodation and relocation for RT. Reducing RT-inconvenience increased uptake of breast conserving treatment for early breast cancer. 38 RT-inconvenience issues were identified for the RIM. Discussion The RT-access framework could facilitate further examination of RT-utilisation and guide interventions to improve it. Several factors, including RT-inconvenience, impact on translation of RT-opportunity to RT-utilisation. The RIM, once developed, may allow quantification of RT-inconvenience.

40|$|Purpose: The authors {{evaluated}} {{the ability of}} a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope to detect glaucomatous visual field loss by using their previously described discriminant formula on a prospectively obtained cohort. The relationship of optic disc size to diagnostic classification was also evaluated. Methods: One eye was chosen randomly from each of 153 subjects. Sixty control eyes had intraocular pressure less than 21 mmHg and normal visual fields; 93 glaucomatous eyes had intraocular pressure greater than 21 mmHg and abnormal visual fields. The optic disc status purposely was not used for classification purposes. All subjects were examined with the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT; Heidelberg Engineering GMBH, Heidelberg, Germany) and Humphrey Perimeter, program 30 - 2 (Humphrey Instruments, Inc., San Leandro, CA). Visual fields were considered abnormal by the authors' previously published criteria. The HRT classification used age, adjusted cup shape <b>measure,</b> <b>rim</b> volume, and height variation contour to classify the optic disc as normal or glaucomatous. Then the authors assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic precision for the entire group, and for three subsets classified by disc area: disc area less than 2 mm 2, between 2 and 3 mm 2, and more than 3 mm 2. Results: The entire group had a sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic precision of 74 %, 88 %, and 80 %, respectively. The specificity was 83 % when disc area was less than 2 mm 2 and improved to 89 % when disc area was more than 2 mm 2. The sensitivity tended to improve from 65 % to 79 %, and to 83 % if the disc area increased, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: In a prospective cohort of patients, the HRT discriminant analysis formula was capable of detecting glaucomatous visual field loss with good precision.

Disks of gas-turbine engine are high loaded parts of irregular shape having intensive stress concentrators wherein a 3 D stress strain state occurs. The loss of load-carrying capability or burst of disk {{can lead to}} severe accident or disaster. Therefore, development of methods to assess deformations and to predict burst {{is one of the}} most important problems. Strength assessment approaches are used at all levels of engine creation. In recent years due to actively developing numerical method, particularly FEA, it became possible to investigate load-carrying capability of irregular shape disks, to use 3 D computing schemes including flow theory and different options of force and deformation failure criteria. In spite of a wide progress and practical use of strength assessment approaches, there is a lack of detailed research data on yield surface of disk alloys. The main purpose of this work is to validate the use of basis hypothesis of flow theory and investigate the yield surface of disk alloys during the disks spin test. The results of quasi-static numerical simulation of spin tests of model disk made from high-temperature forged alloy are presented. To determine stress-strain state of disk during loading finite element analysis is used. Simulation of elastic-plastic strain fields was carried out using incremental theory of plasticity with isotropic hardening. Hardening function was taken from the results of specimens tensile test.

In this study, we use zoning in quartz {{crystals}} from the Bishop Tuff (California) to assess the timescales over which a giant magma body transitions from relatively quiescent, pre-eruptive crystallization to rapid decompression and eruption. Quartz crystals in the Bishop Tuff have distinctive rims (< 200 μm thick), which are Ti-rich and bright in cathodoluminescence (CL) images, and which can be used to calculate Ti diffusional relaxation times. We use synchrotron-based x-ray microfluorescence to obtain quantitative Ti maps and profiles along rim-interior contacts in quartz at resolutions of 1 - 5 μm in each linear dimension. We perform CL imaging on a scanning electron microscope (SEM) using a low-energy (5 kV) incident beam to characterize these contacts in high resolution (< 1 μm in linear dimensions). Quartz growth times were determined using a 1 D model for Ti diffusion, assuming initial step functions. Minimum quartz growth rates were calculated using these calculated growth times and <b>measured</b> <b>rim</b> thicknesses. Maximum rim growth times span from ~ 1 min to 35 years, with a median of ~ 4 days. More than 70 % of rim growth times are less than 1 year, showing that quartz rims have mostly grown in the days to months prior to eruption. Minimum growth rates show distinct modes between 10 - 8 and 10 - 10 m/s (depending on sample), revealing very fast crystal growth rates (100 s of nm to 10 s of μm per day). Our data show that quartz rims grew well within a year of eruption, with most of the growth happening in the weeks or days preceding eruption. Growth took place under conditions of high supersaturation, suggesting that rim growth marks the onset of decompression and the transition from pre-eruptive to syn-eruptive conditions...|$|R

40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} the inferior to temporal neuroretinal rim width ratio and superior to temporal rim width ratio as <b>measures</b> of <b>rim</b> shape for diagnosis of glaucoma.  METHODS—Colour stereo optic disc photographs of 527  normal subjects, 100  ocular hypertensive individuals with normal visual fields, and 202  open angle glaucoma {{patients with a}} mean perimetric defect of less than 10  dB were morphometrically evaluated. Eyes with an optic cup area of <  0. 2  mm 2 were excluded.  RESULTS—In the normal subjects, inferior to temporal rim width ratio (1. 67  (SD 0. 53)) was significantly (p< 0. 0001) higher than superior to temporal rim width ratio (1. 56  (0. 49)). Both ratios were significantly (p< 0. 0001) higher the more vertically the optic disc was configured. In the normal eyes, both ratios were statistically independent of disc size, rim area, refractive error, age, and sex. With the differences being more marked for the inferior to temporal ratio than for the superior to temporal ratio, both rim width ratios were significantly (p< 0. 005) lower in the ocular hypertensive group than in the normal group. Despite the high significance of the differences, diagnostic power of the inferior ratio and the superior ratio was 59 % and 58 %, respectively, indicating a marked overlap between the groups.  CONCLUSIONS—Abnormally low inferior to temporal and superior to temporal rim width ratios can indicate glaucomatous optic nerve damage in some ocular hypertensive eyes. Being independent of optic disc size and ocular magnification, the rim width ratios may be taken as one among other variables for the ophthalmoscopic optic disc evaluation, taking into account, however, a pronounced overlap between normal eyes and ocular hypertensive eyes.    Keywords: neuroretinal rim width ratios; glaucoma; ocular hypertensio...|$|R

The southern coast of Mesoamerica is widely acknowledged as an early locus {{for the development of}} political complexity and social inequality (Clark and Blake 1994; Love 2007). During the Early Formative, Pacific Coast sites such as Paso de la Amada formed some of the first ceremonial centers in Mesoamerica (Clark 2004), and engaged in peer-polity interactions with incipient Olmec centers in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (Clark and Blake 1994; Rosenswig 2005). A high degree of complexity in Early Formative Soconusco centers, however, is poorly supported by empirical evidence of stratification (Leasure and Blake 2002). It is not until the development of Middle Formative centers such as Takalik Abaj, La Blanca, and Izapa that clear evidence of material stratification between elite and non elite contexts begins to emerge (Love 2007). The examination of Middle Formative feasting thus has the potential to explore the means used by elites to consolidate power in some of the first stratified societies on the Pacific Coast of Mesoamerica.

Travellers compare it with the lakes of Nemi and Albano: I found it tame after the cup of Fernando Po with its beautiful lining of hanging woods. It has only the merit of regularity. The unbroken upper <b>rim</b> <b>measures</b> {{about half a mile}} in diameter, and the lower funnel 3,000 feet in circumference. The sides of piedra pomez (pumice) are lined and ribbed with rows of scoriaceous rock as regular as amphitheatre-seats, full 1,000 feet deep, and slope easily into a flat sole, which some are said to have reached on horseback. A copious fountain, springing from the once fiery inside, is collected below {{for the use of the}} farm-house, El Fondo de la Caldera. The fields have the effect of a little Alpine tarn of bright green. Here wild pigeons are sometimes caught at night, and rabbits and partridges are or were not extinct. I ascended Bandana Peak to the north-north-east, the piton of this long extinct volcano, and enjoyed the prospect of the luxuriant vegetation, the turquoise sea, and the golden sands about Maspalomas, the southernmost extremity of Grand Canary.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Hand rim {{wheelchair}} propulsion is {{inefficient and}} physically straining. To evaluate the possibly advantageous {{role in this}} respect of three different prototype hand rim configurations (a rubber foam-coated cylindrical (II) hand rim and two profiled rubber foam-coated hand rims (wide and narrow: III, IV)), a group of 10 unimpaired subjects conducted four submaximal discontinuous wheelchair exercise tests on a computer-controlled wheelchair ergometer, thus allowing a comparison with a standard hand rim (chromium-plated round hand rim (I)). Methods: Apart from physiological measures (oxygen uptake, heart rate (HR), ventilation, mechanical efficiency (ME)), a subjective score for the rating {{of each of the}} hand rims was determined, as well as characteristics of the force application in the propulsion phase during each test condition. Timing parameters of the push and recovery phase were determined. Each exercise test was conducted with one of the four hand rim configurations in a counter-balanced order. Results: Analysis of variance with repeated <b>measures</b> (hand <b>rim</b> configuration, power output) revealed no significant effects (P> 0. 05) on any of the physiological parameters and force application characteristics for the main factor 'hand rim configuration'. Only the subjective score (scale 0 - 10) for rating of the hand rims proved significantly different between the round rubber (7. 5 ± 0. 53) coated hand rim - receiving the highest score - versus the narrow rubber-coated flat profiled hand rim (5. 5 ± 1. 72). Discussion: In this subject group and under the selected tasks and submaximal conditions of wheelchair propulsion, the studied hand rim configurations did not introduce critical shifts in the technique of (de-) coupling and power production in the push phase. As a consequence, no systematic shifts in ME are found among the different hand rim configurations. It is suggested that the biological constraints of the task overrule the possible effects of small design variations of the different hand rim configurations within the studied subject group and under the limited test conditions. The hand rim design characteristics may however be much more critical in (1) experienced wheelchair users, (2) especially those subjects with a limited hand-arm and/or trunk function and/or (3) under much more extreme conditions of daily wheelchair ambulation (i. e. turning, stopping/starting, negotiating a slope) or during peak performance. These issues clearly require continued future research. As such, the current results can be viewed as preliminary results only. © 2003 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To compare {{optic disc}} {{perfusion}} between normal subjects and subjects with glaucoma using {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) angiography and to detect optic disc perfusion changes in glaucoma. Design Observational, cross-sectional study. Participants Twenty-four normal subjects and 11 patients with glaucoma were included. Methods One eye of each subject was scanned by a high-speed 1050 -nm–wavelength swept-source OCT instrument. The split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm was used to compute 3 -dimensional optic disc angiography. A disc flow index was computed from 4 registered scans. Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) was used to <b>measure</b> disc <b>rim</b> area, and stereo photography {{was used to evaluate}} cup/disc (C/D) ratios. Wide-field OCT scans over the discs were used to measure retinal nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness. Main Outcome Measures Variability was assessed by coefficient of variation (CV). Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by sensitivity and specificity. Comparisons between glaucoma and normal groups were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Correlations among disc flow index, structural assessments, and visual field (VF) parameters were assessed by linear regression. Results In normal discs, a dense microvascular network was visible on OCT angiography. This network was visibly attenuated in subjects with glaucoma. The intra-visit repeatability, inter-visit reproducibility, and normal population variability of the optic disc flow index were 1. 2 %, 4. 2 %, and 5. 0 % CV, respectively. The disc flow index was reduced by 25 % in the glaucoma group (P = 0. 003). Sensitivity and specificity were both 100 % using an optimized cutoff. The flow index was highly correlated with VF pattern standard deviation (R[superscript 2] = 0. 752, P = 0. 001). These correlations were significant even after accounting for age, C/D area ratio, NFL, and rim area. Conclusions Optical coherence tomography angiography, generated by the new SSADA, repeatably measures optic disc perfusion and may be useful in the evaluation of glaucoma and glaucoma progression.

40|$|Simple, sensitive, {{rapid and}} {{cost-effective}} methods are described for {{the determination of}} mebrophenhydramine hydrochloride (MPH) in pure form and in tablets using Bromophenol Blue (BPB) as a rea gent. The spectrophotometric method is based or. {{the formation of an}} ion-association complex of the drug with BPB in phthalate buffer of pH 3. 0, its extraction into chloroform and absorbance measurement at 420 nm. In turbidimetry BPB was used to produce stable turbidity arising from the formation of drug-dye complex of very low solubility at an altered pH condition and reagent-concentration and in the presence of potassium chloride. The absorbance of the turbid suspension was <b>measured</b> at 650 <b>rim.</b> Various parameters affecting the analytical procedures were investigated and optimised. In spectrophotometry, Beer's law is obeyed over the concentration range of 2 - 12 mug mL(- 1) with an apparent molar absorptivity of 1. 98 x 10 (4) L moL(- 1) cm(- 1) and Sandell sensitivity of 19. 39 ng cm(- 2). Turbidimetry is applicable in the concentration range of 10 - 70 mug mL(- 1). The limits of detection are 0. 10 and 0. 44 mug mL(- 1) for spectrophotometry and turbidimetry, respectively. The methods were used to determine MPH in standard solution with a coefficient of variation of less than 2 %, and were further applied to the determination of MPH in tablets. The results obtained by the proposed methods agree with the label claim. The reliability of the methods was further established by recovery studies applying standard-addition technique...|$|R
40|$|Serum {{phosphorus}} can {{be measured}} by continu-ous-flow uv spectrophotometry without reduction of the phosphomolybdate complex. The dilute sample is dialyzed into dilute (1 mI/lOU ml) sulfuric acid, then mixed with an ammonium molybdate-sulfuric acid-”Tween 80 ” solution. The absorbance of the sample peaks is measured at 340 nm with a linear-a bsorba nce spectrophotometer. Peak heights are directly proportional to concentration, because logarithmic conversion is performed within the spectrophotometer. The method obeys Beer’s law up to 10 mg of P per deciliter, and results correlate closely with those for standard methods based on reduced phosphomolybdate blue. The miniature manifold uses a 12 -in. dialyzer. The sampling rate can be 60 to 120 samples per hour when a Gilford one-piece debubbler flow cell is used. Additional Keyphrases AutoAnalyzer #{ 149 } linear absorbance spectrophotometry #{ 149 } nonreduction of phosphomolybdate complex Serum inorganic phosphorus Concentration iS measured by continuous-flow systems (AutoAna-lyzer) as the reduced phosphomolybdate complex (1 - 3). However, this blue complex readily pre-cipitates, and may produce a significant sample interaction or carryover. Daly and Ertingshausen (4) found that the unreduced phosphomolybdate complex absorbs ultraviolet light. By using an acidified ammonium molybdate-”Tween 80 ” re-agent and a centrifugal analyzer (“CentrifiChem”), they developed a direct end-point method. We have found that by using the molybdate-Tween 80 reagent, serum inorganic phosphate can be <b>measured</b> at 340 <b>rim</b> with a miniaturized AutoAnalyzer manifold and a linear absorbance spectrophotometer. The results obey Beer’s law at concentrations of 2 to 10 mg of P per 100 ml of serum, and correlate closely with conventional phosphomolybdate blue methods...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{measure the}} nerve-head to fovea {{distance}} (NFD) on fundus photographs in fellow eyes, and {{to compare the}} NFD between fellow eyes. Methods: Diabetic patients without retinopathy, (n = 183) who were screened by fundus photography at the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands from January 1 st 2005 until January 1 st 2006 were included. The NFD was measured in left and right eyes both from the center and from {{the rim of the}} nerve-head. To determine inter- and intra-observer agreement, repeated measurements by one observer (n = 3) were performed on all photographs and by two observers on 60 photographs (30 paired eyes). The effect of age, gender, and refractive error on NFD was analysed. Results: The correlation of NFDs between {{the left and the right}} eye was 0. 958 when measured from the center of the nerve head (mean difference 0. 0078 mm. 6 SD 0. 079 (95 % limits of agreement 20. 147 – 0. 163)) and 0. 963 when <b>measured</b> from the <b>rim</b> (mean difference 0. 00566 SD 0. 073 (95 % limits of agreement 20. 137 – 0. 149)). Using the NFD between fellow eyes interchangeably, resulted in a standard error of 0. 153 mm. Intra- and inter-observer variability was small. We found a significant effect of age (center of the nerve-head (P = 0. 006) and rim of the nerve head (P = 0. 003)) and refractive error (center of nerve-head (P, 0. 001) and rim of nerve head (P, 0. 001)) on NFD.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{performance}} of scanning laser topography (SLT) and scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) {{on the rim of}} the optic nerve head and its surrounding area and thereby to evaluate whether these imaging technologies are influenced by other factors beyond the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Materials and Methodology: A total of 154 eyes from 5 different groups were examined: young healthy subjects (YNorm), old healthy subjects (ONorm), patients with normal tension glaucoma (NTG), patients with open-angle glaucoma and early glaucomatous damage (OAGE) and patients with open-angle glaucoma and advanced glaucomatous damage (OAGA). SLT and SLP measurements were taken. Four concentric circles were superimposed on each of the images: the first one <b>measuring</b> at the <b>rim</b> of the optic nerve head (1. 0 ONHD), the next measuring at 1. 25 optic nerve head diameters (ONHD), at 1. 5 ONHD and at 1. 75 ONHD. The aligned images were analyzed using GDx/NFA software. Results: Both methods showed peaks of RNFL thickness in the superior and inferior segments of the ONH. The maximum thickness, registered by the SLT device was at the ONH rim where the SLP device tended to measure the lowest values. SLT measurements at the ONH were influenced by other tissues besides the RNFL like blood vessels and glial tissues. SLT and SLP were most strongly correlated at distances of 1. 25 and 1. 5 ONHD. Conclusions: While both imaging technologies are valuable tools in detecting glaucoma, measurements at the ONH rim should be interpreted critically since both methods might provide misleading results.
