50|$|In general, the hotter a grain is kilned, {{the less}} its diastatic activity. As a consequence, only lightly colored grains {{can be used}} as base malts, with <b>Munich</b> <b>malt</b> being the darkest base malt {{generally}} available.|$|E

50|$|Weizenbock is a {{style of}} bock brewed using wheat instead of barley. It was first {{produced}} in Bavaria in 1907 by G. Schneider & Sohn and was named Aventinus after a Bavarian historian.

5000|$|... 2009 - Baltic Porter, ABV 5.8%, Few beers fit {{the season}} like a Baltic Porter does winter. The 2009 edition of Snowstorm was brewed with copious amounts of <b>Munich</b> <b>malt</b> coupled with three {{different}} British crystal malts, and British Chocolate. Snowstorm is dark mahogany in color with a tan head and displays flavors reminiscent of dark fruit, licorice, and chocolate.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Munich</b> <b>malt</b> {{is used as}} {{the base}} malt of the bock beer style, {{especially}} doppelbock, and appears in dunkel lager and Märzens in smaller quantities. While a darker grain than pale malt, it has sufficient diastatic power to self-convert, despite being kilned at temperatures around 115 °C. It imparts [...] "malty," [...] although not necessarily sweet characteristics, depending on mashing temperatures. ASBC 4-6/EBC 10-15, DP 40 °Lintner.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to crystal malts in Britain, central Europe {{makes use}} of caramel malts, which are {{moistened}} and kilned at temperatures around 55-65 °C in a rotating drum before being heated to higher temperatures for browning. The lower-temperature moistened kilning causes conversion and mashing {{to take place in}} the oven, resulting in a grain's starches becoming mostly or entirely converted to sugar before darkening. Caramel malts are produced in color grades analogous to other lager malts: carapils for pilsener malt, caravienne or carahell for Vienna malt, and caramunch for <b>Munich</b> <b>malt.</b> Color and final kilning temperature are comparable to non-caramel analog malts; there is no diastatic activity. Carapils malt is sometimes also called dextrin malt. 10-120 °L.|$|E
50|$|In Bavaria, Dunkel, {{along with}} helles, is a {{traditional}} style brewed in Munich and popular throughout Bavaria. With alcohol concentrations of 4.5% to 6% by volume, dunkels are weaker than Doppelbocks, another traditional dark Bavarian beer. Dunkels are produced using <b>Munich</b> <b>malts</b> which give the Dunkel its colour. Other malts or flavours may also be added.|$|R

40|$|Current {{literature}} on the dual diagnosis in cases of schizophrenia and alcohol dependence has reported how pharmacological treatment has positive effects on the reduction of both disorders. Nevertheless, patients have considerable difficulties in following the prescribed medication. This work aims to build an engagement stage and therapeutic relationship in seven patients with schizophrenic and alcohol-related disorder cases. This result was achieved {{through the use of}} the vignette technique and narrative psychodynamic approach during group counselling sessions. Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) and <b>Munich</b> Alcoholism Test (<b>MALT)</b> were applied before and after treatment. A follow-up session was organized. The PANSS and MALT scores indicated there was no reduction of the psychiatric symptoms after treatment. The follow-up session showed positive outcomes in terms of increasing the level of socialisation as well as awareness of their own condition; at the same, an adherence to pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy for all the subjects...|$|R
40|$|In honour of Prof. Dr. Dr. h. c. rnult. Adolf Butenandt on the {{occasion}} of his eightieth birthday Summary: Alcoholism is a common disease; it is found in 10 % to 15 % of all patients admitted to general hos-pitals. There is no single characteristic finding, but on the other band, changes s compared with normal values {{have been reported in the}} literature for more than 30 frequently assayed clinical chemical and haematological pa-rameters. In the project reported here all 24 clinical chemical parameters and all 8 haematological parameters frequent-ly assayed were studied in each of 82 hospitalized inen with a confirmed diagnosis of alcoholism. The diagnosis of alcoholism was made on the basis of the <b>Munich</b> Alcoholism Test (<b>MALT)</b> together with the following standardized assessments and examinations: past history, an alcohol questionnaire, general physical examination and neurological examination. All forms were filled in completely. All Steps in the clinical laboratory investigations were standardized, and all were subject to ongoing reliability control. The clinical problem is usually not to differentiate alcohol abusers or alcoholics from healthy persons but rather to identify the alcoholics among a population of patients with a variety of illnesses...|$|R
