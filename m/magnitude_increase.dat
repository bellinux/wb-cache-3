For the total sample we find evidence of positive magnitude dependence for recessions, while for expansions we are not able to reject the null of magnitude independence. This last result is likely due to a structural change in the mechanism guiding expansions before and after the second World War. In particular, upturns show negative magnitude dependence in the post-World War II sub-sample, meaning that in this period expansions become less likely to end as their <b>magnitude</b> <b>increases.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|In May and June 2002 Roberto Soria and {{his colleagues}} at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics {{discovered}} two Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. ULXs are objects that emit tremendous amounts of X-rays (> 1032 watts or 1039 erg/s), assuming they radiate isotropically (the same in all directions). This amount is larger than currently understood stellar processes (including supernovae) but smaller than the amount of X-rays emitted by active galactic nuclei, which accounts for their alternate name, Intermediate-luminosity X-ray Objects (IXOs). The source designated ULX1 was found in a relatively empty interarm region, far from any bright clusters or star-forming complexes, and showed a 75% increase in X-ray luminosity over the course of 20 days. ULX2 was found in an exceptionally bright young stellar complex, and showed an order of <b>magnitude</b> <b>increase</b> over the same time period.|$|E

In both cases, the back reflection of the ASE from the edges of the disk should be suppressed. This can be done with absorbing layers, shown with green in Figure 4.

40|$|When two targets (T 1 & T 2) are {{presented}} in rapid succession, observers often fail to report T 2 if they attend to T 1. The bottleneck theory proposes that this attentional blink (AB) is due to T 1 occupying a slow processing stage when T 2 is presented. Accordingly, if increasing T 1 difficulty increases T 1 processing time, this should cause a greater AB. The attention capture hypothesis suggests that T 1 captures attention, which cannot be reallocated to T 2 in time. Accordingly, if increasing T 1 difficulty decreases T 1 saliency, this should cause a smaller AB. In two experiments we find support for an attention capture hypothesis. In Experiment 1 we find that AB <b>magnitude</b> <b>increases</b> with T 1 contrast – but only when T 1 is unmasked.
