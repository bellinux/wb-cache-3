2500|$|While {{promoting}} his debut album, Everyday Robots, {{in an interview}} with NME, Albarn said: [...] "I can definitely see another Gorillaz-esque record at some point, yeah. That will almost definitely happen. I could put a Gorillaz record out next week; I’ve got enough stuff that I haven’t finished. The only thing really that defines a Gorillaz record in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> when I just play most of it on keyboards. I’ve just been in Paris with Jamie Hewlett. There are points in everyone's relationship where they fall out with people that they're close to and then they reconcile, hopefully, and actually, you know, the relationship's probably in a healthier place as a result of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vocalist Dave Mustaine described, in Guitar Center Sessions, the {{development}} of [...] "Symphony of Destruction" [...] as stroke of luck. One day while driving down Riverside Drive in Toluca Lake, Los Angeles to his home, he was stricken by a headache. [...] Inspired, he began writing lyrics {{on the back of}} a sushi receipt, [...] " [...] My metal brains corroding, <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> going to explode". In 1992 Megadeth recorded the demo for what would become [...] "Symphony of Destruction" [...] and after some tweaking, the song was finished and recorded for inclusion on their fifth studio album, Countdown to Extinction. Originally, the first version of the song was much longer but was edited a lot during its pre-production for Countdown.|$|E
2500|$|... nerves are {{stretched}} like a wire; the simplest outing becomes a huge challenge – I {{have to have}} Angela's arm to support me most days... my balance {{or lack of it}} is probably my biggest problem. My blessings are my memories and we have a few very loyal friends who help us through the bad days... Financially all's well. Thank goodness my wife, who holds nothing of the past over <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>is</b> constantly at my side. Real love never dies. We share a sense of humour which at times is vital. If I have a philosophy it is that life doesn't put everything your way. It takes a little back. I strive to remember the ups rather than the downs. I {{have a lot of time}} with my thoughts these days and sometimes they hurt so much I can hardly bear it. However, my friends always associate me with the song: [...] "When You're Smiling..." [...] lt isn't always easy but I'm trying to live up to it.|$|E
