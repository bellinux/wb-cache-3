The Battle for Romania began in late summer: while German commanders Johannes Frießner and Otto Wöhler of the Army Group South Ukraine attempted to hold Bukovina, Soviet Steppe Front leader Rodion Malinovsky stormed into the areas of Moldavia defended by Petre Dumitrescu's troops. In reaction, Antonescu attempted to stabilize the front on a line between Focșani, Nămoloasa and Brăila, deep inside Romanian territory. On August 5, he visited Hitler one final time in Kętrzyn. On this occasion, the German leader reportedly explained that his people had betrayed the Nazi cause, {{and asked him if}} Romania would go on fighting (to which Antonescu reportedly answered in vague terms). After Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov more than once stated that the Soviet Union was not going to require Romanian subservience, the factions opposing Antonescu agreed that the <b>moment</b> <b>had</b> come to overthrow him, by carrying out the Royal Coup of August 23. On that day, the sovereign asked Antonescu to meet him in the royal palace building, where he presented him with a request to take Romania out of its Axis alliance. The Conducător refused, and was promptly arrested by soldiers of the guard, being replaced as Premier with General Constantin Sănătescu, who presided over a national government.|$|E

40|$|Pseudo-Zernike <b>moments</b> <b>have</b> better feature {{representation}} {{capabilities and}} are more robust to image noise than the conventional Zernike moments. However, pseudo-Zernike <b>moments</b> <b>have</b> not been extensively used as feature descriptors due to the computational complexity of the pseudo-Zernike radial polynomials. This paper discusses the drawbacks of the existing methods, and proposes an efficient recursive algorithm to compute the pseudo-Zernike moments. The algorithm consists of a two-stage recurrence relation for radial polynomials and coefficients of the polynomials, which are specifically derived for fast computation of pseudo-Zernike moments. The performance of the algorithm is experimentally examined using both binary and grayscale images, and {{it shows that the}} computational speed of pseudo-Zernike <b>moments</b> <b>has</b> been substantially improved over the present methods. 1...|$|R

Therefore, at large distances any magnetic source looks like a dipole with the same magnetic moment.|$|R
25|$|The {{engagement}} at Friedland was {{a strategic}} necessity after the Battle of Eylau earlier in 1807 {{had failed to}} yield a decisive verdict for either side. The battle began when Bennigsen noticed the seemingly isolated corps of Marshal Lannes at the town of Friedland. Bennigsen, who planned only to secure his march northward to Wehlau and never intended to risk an engagement against Napoleon's numerically-superior forces, {{thought he had a}} good chance of destroying these isolated French units and ordered his entire army over the Alle River. Lannes held his ground against determined Russian attacks until Napoleon could bring additional forces onto the field. Bennigsen could have recalled the Russian forces, numbering about 50,000–60,000 men, and retreated across the river before the arrival of Napoleon’s entire army but, being in poor health, decided to stay at Friedland and took no measures to protect his exposed and exhausted army. By late afternoon, the French had amassed a force of 80,000 troops on the battlefield. Relying on superior numbers, Napoleon concluded that the <b>moment</b> <b>had</b> come and ordered a massive assault against the Russian left flank. The sustained French attack pushed back the Russian army and pressed them against the river behind. Unable to withstand the pressure, the Russians broke and started escaping across the Alle, where an unknown number of them died from drowning. The Russian army suffered horrific casualties at Friedland–losing over 40% of its soldiers on the battlefield.|$|E

500|$|Using his own comitatus, Constantius {{succeeded in}} driving the Alamanni out of Raetia (354), and binding {{the kings of}} {{southern}} Alamannia, Wadomar and Gundomad, with a treaty of alliance. Meanwhile, Silvanus made considerable progress in restoring the situation in Gaul. But the following year (355), Silvanus capitalised on his military success by [...] proclaiming himself emperor at Colonia (Cologne) and leading his men in a rebellion against Constantius. Constantius responded by dispatching to Cologne a flying-squad of protectores domestici (imperial staff-officers), including the future historian Ammianus himself, {{under the command of}} Ursicinus. These swiftly captured and executed Silvanus and prevented a wider mutiny. But the shaken emperor decided that he needed a member of his own imperial dynasty (the House of Constantine, known to the Romans as the Flavii, after Constantine the Great's clan name) to share the burdens of governing the empire. This was a difficult decision for a paranoid ruler who regarded all his relatives with intense suspicion and had already put to death 2 of his uncles and 7 cousins, including Julian's half-brother Constantius Gallus. (Although the House of Constantine was the first Roman imperial dynasty to profess the Christian faith, its internal strife was as ruthless as any of its predecessors). He appointed his cousin Julian as Caesar (deputy emperor) for the [...] "Three Gauls" [...] (the dioceses of Gaul, Spain and Britain) and gave him overall command of forces in Gaul. The appointment was widely seen as unsuitable as Julian, who was just 23 years old, had no military experience and until that <b>moment</b> <b>had</b> spent his time studying philosophy at Athens.
