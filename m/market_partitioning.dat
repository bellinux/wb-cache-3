40|$|Abstract: The {{paper offers}} an {{analytical}} approach for an integrated treatment of <b>market</b> <b>partitioning</b> and benchmarking within a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) framework. Based on an empirical example from {{the automotive industry}} we measure product efficiency from the customer’s perspective. This is interpreted as customer value, i. e., as a ratio of outputs that customers obtain from a product (e. g., resale value, reliability) and inputs that customers have to invest (e. g., price, running costs). Products offering a maximum customer value relative to all other alternatives represent efficient peers, which constitute benchmarks for different sub-markets. All products benchmarked via the same efficient peer(s) constitute a sub-market including the benchmarks. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a broader, {{economic}} perspective on customer value management. By developing an efficiency-based concept of customer value we aim at contributing to the presently underrepresented research field of marketing economics. The customer value concept is utilized to assess product performance and eventually to determine the competitive market structure and the product-market boundaries. Our analytical approach to product-market structuring based on customer value is developed within a microeconomic framework. We measure customer value as the product efficiency viewed from the customer’s perspective, i. e., as a ratio of outputs (e. g., resale value, reliability, safety, comfort) that customers obtain from a product relative to inputs (price, running costs) that customers have to deliver in exchange. The efficiency value derived can be understood as the return on the customer’s investment. Products offering a maximum customer value relative to all other alternatives in the market are characterized as efficient. Different efficient products may create value in different ways using different strategies (output-input- combinations). Each efficient product can be viewed as a benchmark for a distinct sub-market. Jointly, these products form the efficient frontier, which serves as a reference function for the inefficient products. Thus, we define customer value of alternative products as a relative concept. <b>Market</b> <b>partitioning</b> is achieved endogenously by clustering products in one segment that are benchmarked by the same efficient peer(s). This ensures that only products with a similar output-input structure are partitioned into the same sub-market. As a result, a sub-market consists of highly substitutable products. In addition, value-creating strategies (i. e., indications of how to vary inputs and outputs) to improve product performance in order to offer maximum customer value are provided. The impact of each performance parameter on customer value is determined, identifying the value drivers among them. This methodological framework is applied to data of the 1996 German Automobile Club (ADAC) survey.

In order to fill this gap, we explore whether light brands perform similarly to regular brands in terms of (a) brand performance measures (BPMs), such as market share (MS) and penetration, (b) loyalty levels, and (c) customer sharing. We analyse three product categories (cola, flavoured carbonated beverages and margarine) using UK household panel data provided by Kantar. The results show that when considering standard BPMs (that is MS, penetration and purchase frequency), regular brands receive higher BPMs than light brands. However, when considering repeat purchase loyalty, light brands achieve greater levels of loyalty than their regular counterparts.

Cartel is an agreement under which competitors agree not to compete with each other and presents the most serious form of anticompetitive behaviour. Such arrangements allow companies to exert market power they would not otherwise have by artificially restricting competition with deleterious effect on welfare. Competition authorities around the world continue to declare cartel detection and conviction in competition enforcement as their highest priority. Taking part in cartel can have severe consequences for managers as well for the undertaking. In some jurisdictions employees involved in the infringement of competition law are criminally prosecuted facing financial fines and possible imprisonment. The reason behind it is an acknowledgment by competition authorities that the mere threat of sanctions against managers and personal liability could be a more effective deterrent than the possibility of only undertaking-focused sanctions. The amount of fines imposed for antitrust infringements, and for hard core cartel violations in particular, has notably augmented over the last years. This paper will argue why managers are employed in harmful activities risking imposition of severe fines and adverse reputational impact for themselves and the owners of the undertakings they work for and what are the tools within undertaking that can reduce the risk of being involved in unlawful antitrust practices and minimize the negative impact if anticompetitive behaviour has occurred...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>market</b> <b>partition</b> between two {{distinct}} firms that deliver services to waiting time sensitive customers. In our model, the incoming customers select a firm {{on the basis}} of its posted price, the expected waiting time and its brand.

Considering that the two underlying queueing processes operate under high traffic regimes, we analyze the market sharing dynamics by using a diffusion process. As a function of control parameters, such as the waiting and brand departure costs or the incoming traffic intensity, we are able to analytically characterize a transition between an Hotelling-like regime (dominated by brand considerations) and a deadline type regime (dominated by waiting time considerations). The market sharing dynamics is described by the time evolution of a boundary point, which time evolution belongs to the class of noise-induced phase transitions, so far widely discussed in physics, chemistry and biology.

40|$|China is {{the most}} populous country in the world. Of its 1. 3 billion people, 22 % of the world population, about 67 % are living in rural areas. Although China is the third largest country in terms of area, the arable land is only 7 % of the global amount. With {{relatively}} meager endowment, it is undoubtedly a daunting task for the agricultural sector to provide adequate supply to fulfil huge needs for food and other agricultural products. In addition, agriculture development in China confronts with challenges to raise the average income and standard of living of the rural population in the long run. Since China's economic reform was launched in 1978, the "People's Commune" system was dismantled and replaced by the "Household Responsibility" system. Agricultural production has achieved rapid growth and income per capita in the rural area has risen 10 times in 20 years. During this transformation process, a number of serious problems have been emerging in the agricultural sector. They include the diminishing size of the arable land, enlarging of income disparity and stagnating of productivity growth, which have been exacerbated by the population growth and increasing demands for agricultural products. The agricultural sector is also plagued by environmental degradation and confronted by township enterprise development. Furthermore, China's recent accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO) brings more tremendous challenges to its agriculture. This paper is intended to provide a concise analysis of the problems and possible policy options associated with current agriculture development. It reveals that the main problems are <b>market</b> <b>partition,</b> inefficiency in government administration in supply and distribution, and price distortions of agricultural products, originating from China's development strategy of preferred industrialization in the industry sector and urban development. This paper also explores and assesses a few government policy options for the alleviation of these problems. Policy options focus on deepening market-oriented reforms, including price deregulation, market integration and property (land) reforms, which also reflect {{the requirements of the}} Agriculture Agreement of WTO. Policy options also focus on improvement of government supported programs in investment and subsidies aimed at boosting productivity, narrowing the inequality of income distribution and easing the barriers for mobility of surplus labor into the industry and service sectors in urban areas.

40|$|This work {{analyzes}} {{the problem of}} optimal pricing policies in markets characterized by cross-group network externalities (two-sided markets) and {{in the presence of}} information held by companies about the social network of consumers. The thesis is divided in three chapters, each one readable as a distinct paper. The first chapter aims at providing a comprehensive overview {{of the state of the}} art in the literature of two-sided markets, i. e. markets characterized by the presence of platforms serving different groups of consumers linked with each other by network externalities. In particular, chapter 1 explains the main trade-offs and issues raised in the literature concerning different market structures (monopoly vs. oligopoly), exclusivity of the service (multi- vs. single-homing), price instruments (membership vs. transaction fees), type of externality (inter- vs. intra- group), interest of customers in quality and type of price discrimination (cross- vs. within-group). Chapter 2 is closely related to the first and aims at investigating about a very recent direction of the research in two-sided market. In particular, it provides an analysis of the practice of firms to offer different prices to consumers according to the past purchase behavior (BBPD) in the context of two-sided markets. In a two period model, two platforms compete for heterogeneous firms and end-users. Our contribution is that we allow platforms to discriminate prices on the users' side according to their past purchase behavior. The main findings are two. In the second period game with market shares taken as given, each platform may find it optimal either to offer discounts to rivals' users or to reward loyalty, depending on the number of users attracted in the past. Moreover, switching towards both platforms occurs if and only if the inherited <b>market</b> <b>partition</b> is symmetric enough. Making the first period game endogenous, BBPD affects both ex-ante and ex-post competition. Ex-post competition is strengthened compared to the regime in which a uniform price is charged in users' side. Ex-ante competition is relaxed (intensified) if users are the low (high) value group. The overall effect on inter-temporal profits of platforms is negative, confirming the previous results of BBPD literature. Chapter 3 changes completely topic compared to the first two. Specifically, it models the strategy of a monopolist that offers rewards to current clients in order to induce them to activate their social network and convince peers to buy from the company. In presence of heterogeneous search costs and reservation prices, this network-activation reward program may serve to expand the client base through a flow of information from informed to uninformed consumers. The offer of the monopolist affects individual incentives of aware people to share information, determining a minimal degree condition for investment. The optimal unitary reward balances the information spread effect (i. e. more receivers) and the crowding effect (i. e. less individual incentives) of an increase in the number of speakers. The monopolist always finds it profitable to use the bonus. Nevertheless, its introduction has ambiguous effects on the price and profits, depending on the process of spread of information and, in turn, on the network structure...|$|R

The results of using confirmatory factor analysis indicates that search has an insignificant effect on the satisfaction of switchers, and {{a negative effect on}} repeaters. Other findings show that search effort has a positive direct effect on satisfaction for buyers of Asian makes and a negative direct effect on satisfaction of buyers of Chrysler makes. ^ Part Two establishes the effect of satisfaction on both intended and actual repurchase rate and positive and negative word-of-mouth behavior. A logit specification in a system of seemingly unrelated regression equations is employed to accomplish this task. The findings verify these hypotheses and conclude that satisfaction is indeed very beneficial for the firm. Moreover, by using likelihood ratio tests and comparing elasticities, support for the hypotheses that (1) the effect of satisfaction on repurchase rate decays over time, and (2) satisfaction has a greater impact on negative than positive word-of-mouth behavior, is found. ^ Part Three models the effect of satisfaction on loyalty and switching behavior for market segments, manufacturers, and makes within a manufacturer. A two-choice stochastic model is used, which is a modification of Blumen 2 ̆ 7 s mover-stayer model. The results validate that satisfaction affects loyalty for all submarkets.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To draw {{together}} {{insights from}} three perspectives (health economics, organizational ecology, and institutional theory) in order to clarify {{the factors that influence}} entries of providers into healthcare markets. A model centered on the concept of an organizational field is advanced as the level of analysis best suited to examining the assortment and interdependence of organizational populations and the institutional forces that shape this co-evolution. In particular, the model argues that: (1) different populations of healthcare providers partition fiscal, geographic, and demographic resource environments in order to ameliorate competition and introduce service complementarities; and (2) competitive barriers to entry within populations of providers vary systematically with regulatory regimens. DATA SOURCES: County-level entries of hospitals and home health agencies in the San Francisco Bay Area using data from the American Hospital Association (1945 - 1991) and California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (1976 - 1991). Characteristics of the resource environment are derived from the Area Resource File (ARF) and selected government censuses. METHODS OF ANALYSIS: A comparative design is applied to contrast influences on hospital and home health agency entries during the post-World War II period. Empirical estimates are obtained using Poisson and negative binomial regression models. RESULTS: Hospital and HHA <b>markets</b> are <b>partitioned</b> primarily by the age and education of consumers and, to a lesser extent, by urbanization levels and public funding expenditures. Such resource partitioning allows independent HHAs to exist comfortably in concentrated hospital markets. For both hospitals and HHAs, the barriers to entry once generated by oligopolistic concentration have declined noticeably with the market-oriented reforms of the past 15 years. CONCLUSION: A field-level perspective demonstrates that characteristics of local resource environments interact with interdependencies of provider populations and broader regulatory regimes to affect significantly the types of provider organizations likely to enter a given healthcare market...|$|R
