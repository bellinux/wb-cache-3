Subsurface loads are found to be relatively unimportant in the highlands, and when subsurface loads are neglected, the best fitting bulk densities for a number of highland regions are found to vary from 2590 to 2870 kg m(- 3), with a <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> of 2691 <b>kg</b> m(- 3). Crustal rock densities estimated from geochemical considerations and global iron and titanium abundances imply somewhat greater densities, which we interpret as porosity affecting the gravity-derived bulk density estimates.

40|$|SUMMARY In intra- and extracranial arteries from cat and man (under {{conditions}} in which dilation was blocked), 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) produced a contraction at lower doses than that produced by tryptamine. Methysergide inhibited the S-HT-induced contraction of the extracranial arteries in a competitive manner. In intracranial arteries the inhibition comprised a reduction in slope and maximum of the log dose-response curves. The contractile effects of 5 -HT on both types of arteries appear to be mediated by 5 -HT receptors, but the receptors have different characteristics {{in the sense that}} the mode of antagonism by methysergide was different. The dissociation constant (Kg) and the corresponding pA 2 value (8. 61 x 10 " M and 8. 21, respectively) for the interaction between methysergide and 5 -HT in extracranial arteries conform with that reported for other smooth muscle tissues. The dilator response was tested in arteries given an active tonic contraction with prostaglandin F 2 (1. Both 5 -HT and tryptamine produced a dose-dependent dilation, 5 -HT being the more potent. Neither methysergide nor LSD antagonized the response in a competitve manner whereas the two / 3 -receptor antagonists, propranolol and 1 -JV-isopropyl-p-nitrophenyl-ethanolamine (INPEA), caused a parallel shift of the log dose-response curves (tested for 5 -HT). The <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> for <b>Kg</b> (pA 2) in the presence of propranolol were 1. 93 x 10 - " M (8. 29) for the intracranial and 1. 83 x 1 0 * M (8. 50) for the extracranial vessels.

However, regarding the amount of N fixed, there are hardly any published data for winter peas. Therefore, the N fixation of five regular leafed winter peas types and one semi-leafless spring pea cultivar in single and mixed cropping (with winter rye spring cereals respectively) was measured in four successive growing seasons (2003 / 04 – 2006 / 07) at the experimental farm of the University of Kassel and in two consecutive vegetation periods (2005 / 06 - 2006 / 07) at the experimental farm of the University of Applied Science in Osnabrueck. The amount of N fixed was calculated according to the extended difference method at the beginning of flowering and at grain harvest. N fixation was usually higher for winter peas than for spring pea. At the beginning of flowering the amount of N fixed in pure stands was with a <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> of 92 <b>kg</b> ha- 1 for winter peas and 29 kg ha- 1 for the spring pea higher than in mixture with a <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> of 42 and 15 kg ha- 1 respectively. At grain harvest the amount of N fixed for the spring pea in pure stands was higher than in mixtures with a mean of 65 and 33 kg ha- 1 respectively. On the other hand the N fixation for winter peas was usually comparable in pure and mixed stands with a mean of 100 and 86 kg ha- 1 respectively. This was a consequence of the higher pea grain yield in mixture than in pure stands and of a reduced biomass (leaves) loss in mixtures. Therefore, regular leaf winter peas can contribute to the N supply of the crop rotation better than spring peas...|$|R

Contrarily, the organic waste produced by fruits and vegetables processing industry is predictable in quality and quantity. This study considers the production of lactic acid from waste organic material using one-step or two-step approaches. One-step approaches are based on simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation, while in two-step approaches both are carried out sequentially. It is recommended to implement one-step and two-step processes for an on- and off-site utilization of organic waste, respectively. The scenarios sketched are based on organic waste produced by hotels and in urban areas, and organic waste produced by fruits and vegetables processing industries. It is argued that a decentralized one-step process is appropriate at locations, such as food and vegetables processing industries, where sufficient organic waste is formed and interest in using the bio-based products exists. While two-step processes are to implement at locations where organic and inorganic waste streams are mixed and quality and quantity vary. It is further argued that a decentralized utilization may not end with a final product, but with an easy transportable solution containing either convertible nutrients or the lactic acid containing fermentation broth serving as feedstock to relevant industries. The sketched scenarios {{are not limited to}} lactic acid, but can be considered for other biobased products whose production contributes to sustainability and bioeconomy...|$|R

Limited knowledge is available on doses received indirectly by organs, during diagnostic procedures. In the present study, the radiation dose to the lens of the eyes was measured from various Computerized Axial Tomography protocols for head and trunk imaging. Thermoluminescence dosimeters were used to measure organ doses in an anthropomorphic Rando Alderson phantom. The unwanted (non-useful) radiation doses delivered to the eye lens during Computerized Axial To-mography examination of head, facial bone, orbits, abdomen, chest, pelvis, neck, nasopharynx, cervical spine, lumbar spine, and sacroiliac joint were as-sessed. The following results are obtained: head scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 8. 74 mGy; facial bone scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 8. 03 mGy; orbital scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 61. 51 mGy; abdomen scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 76 mGy; chest scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 1. 03 mGy; pelvis scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 46 mGy; neck scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 1. 81 mGy; nasopharynx scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 8. 56 mGy; cervical spine scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 6. 15 mGy; lumber spine scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 46 mGy; and sacroiliac joint scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 35 mGy.

40|$|Abstract. The {{extended}} <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> E(r, s;x, y) play {{an important}} role in theory of <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> and theory of inequalities, and even in the whole math-ematics, since many norms in mathematics are always means. Its study is not only interesting but important, both because most of the two-variable <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> are special cases of E(r, s;x, y), and because it is challenging to study a function whose formulation is so indeterminate. In this expositive article, we summarize the recent main results about study of E(r, s;x, y), including definition, basic properties, monotonicities, compar-ison, logarithmic convexities, Schur-convexities, generalizations of concepts of <b>mean</b> <b>values,</b> applications to quantum, to theory of special functions, to es-tablishment of Steffensen pairs, and to generalization of Hermite-Hadamard’s inequality. 1. Definition and expressions of the extended <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> The histories of <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> and inequalities are long [9]. The <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> are related to the <b>Mean</b> <b>Value</b> Theorems for derivative or for integral, which are the bridge between the local and global properties of functions. The arithmetic-mean-geometric-mean inequality is probably the most important inequality, and certainly a keystone of the theory of inequalities [2]. Inequalities of <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> are one of the main parts of theory of inequalities, they have explicit geometric meanings [14]. The theory of <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> plays an important role in the whole mathematics, since many norms in mathematics are always means. 1. 1.
