It will also analyze how these <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> reduction affect performance of the athletes. Method: To gather {{the information about the}} usage <b>of</b> particular <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> reduction this thesis uses a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was filled by 20 wrestlers <b>of</b> different <b>weight</b> categories in greco-roman wrestling. All of them are professional athletes at the age of 20 - 35. Results: The results of the research show that reduction <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the professional wrestlers is strongly influenced by their individual personality. It is apparent especially in different approaches to weight reduction chosen by single wrestlers. The questionnaire implies that the most commonly used <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> reduction before championships are: wearing more layers of clothes in order to increase sweating, diet adjustments and reduction, and usage of pharmacological or nutritional supports.

3000|$|The {{solution}} of LSE problem (1) {{can be obtained}} using direct elimination, the nullspace <b>method</b> and <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>weighting.</b> In direct elimination and nullspace methods, the LSE problem is first transformed into unconstrained linear least squares (LLS) problem and then it is solved via normal equations or QR factorization methods.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many obese {{individuals}} {{lose weight}} to reduce weight stigma; however, {{little is known}} about whether other people's attitudes actually improve towards obese individuals after they have lost weight, and whether changes in attitudes depend on the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> loss. This study examined changes in people's perceptions of an obese target who had lost weight through diet and exercise or through surgery. METHOD: Participants (N= 73) initially viewed an image of an obese woman or a thin woman (control condition), and were asked to indicate their perceptions of the target with respect to the target's behaviors (for example, how often she exercises), as well as some personality characteristics (for example, lazy, sloppy and competent). Participants then viewed a more recent image of the target in which she had lost weight, and were informed that the target had lost weight through diet and exercise or through surgery, or were not provided with any explanation for the weight loss. Participants once again indicated their impression of the target on the same measures. RESULTS: Regardless <b>of</b> the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> loss, all targets were rated as eating more healthily, exercising more, and being more competent and less sloppy after having lost weight. Participants also rated the target as less lazy when they learned that she had lost weight through diet and exercise, or when no information was provided about the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> loss; the target who lost weight through surgery, however, was not seen as being any less lazy after losing weight. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that perceptions of obese individuals can in fact improve after they have lost weight, but that this might depend on the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> loss. 6 page(s...|$|R

Subjects were 436 wrestlers randomly selected from the wrestling clubs in Tehran employing cluster sample setting method. Subjects were interviewed based on a designed questionnaire. Body fat levels were measured based on skin fold measurements. Results Weight loss methods practiced by 62 % of all subjects {{during the previous year}} employing rapid (≤ 7 days before the matches) and gradual (> 7 days before the matches) weight reduction methods (73 % and 34 % of wrestlers who reduced their weight respectively). In addition, opinions on <b>weight</b> reduction, the <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> loss used, and the side effects <b>of</b> the <b>weight</b> loss practices as well as consumption of supplements among the subjects were reported in this study.

Some preventive measures including education and new rules such as scheduling weigh-ins immediately prior to the competitions and mat-side weigh-in are needed to prevent these unhealthy practices.
