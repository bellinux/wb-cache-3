25|$|These {{equations}} <b>mathematically</b> <b>model</b> the behaviour of a limb {{in terms}} of a knowledge domain-independent, link-segment model, such as idealized solids of revolution or a skeleton with fixed-length limbs and perfect pivot joints. From these equations, inverse dynamics derives the torque (moment) level at each joint based on the movement of the attached limb or limbs affected by the joint. This process used to derive the joint moments is known as inverse dynamics because it reverses the forward dynamics equations of motion, the set of differential equations which yield the position and angle trajectories of the idealized skeleton's limbs from the accelerations and forces applied.|$|E

Atkinson, David Birch {{and their}} colleagues {{developed}} the theory of [...] "Dynamics of Action" [...] to <b>mathematically</b> <b>model</b> change in behavior {{as a consequence of}} the interaction of motivation and associated tendencies toward specific actions. [...] The theory posits that change in behavior occurs when the tendency for a new, unexpressed behavior becomes dominant over the tendency currently motivating action. [...] In the theory, the strength of tendencies rises and falls as a consequence of internal and external stimuli (sources of instigation), inhibitory factors, and consummatory in factors such as performing an action. In this theory, there are three causes responsible for behavior and change in behavior: ...|$|E
