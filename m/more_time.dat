MITS needed <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to get a computer with 7k bytes of memory working, and they needed <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to get the software finished. When Allen arrived at MITS it took a day to get the software running; Allen remembers this being caused by computer memory problems while Roberts remembers the delay was due to software problems.|$|E

5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote <b>more</b> <b>time</b> and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E
5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with <b>more</b> <b>time</b> {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E

5|$|After Rupert's {{retirement}} from active seafaring in around 1674, {{he was able}} to spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> engaged in scientific research and became credited with many inventions and discoveries, although some subsequently {{turned out to be the}} innovative introduction of European inventions into England. Rupert converted some of the apartments at Windsor Castle to a luxury laboratory, complete with forges, instruments and raw materials, from where he conducted a range of experiments.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{construction}} and reconstruction work resumed on the A3 motorway. The battle damage {{was the first}} to be addressed, along with removal of the trenches excavated in the flyover embankments. Similarly, unexploded ordnance and minefields left around the motorway had to be removed by minesweepers. The motorway pavement was seriously deteriorated, as evidenced by extensive ruts and cracks incurred during the four-year wartime period. Unlike repairs made to the viaducts and flyovers, mine clearance and pavement reconstruction took considerably <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to perform.|$|E

5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata with the Thomanerchor on 2 February 1725, in the morning service in the Nikolaikirche and reprised it in the vesper service in the Thomaskirche, as was usual in Leipzig on high holidays. Bach performed it at least one <b>more</b> <b>time</b> after 1735.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata only once, in Leipzig's main church Nikolaikirche on 25 November 1731. According to Wolff, Bach performed it only this one time, although the 27th Sunday after Trinity occurred one <b>more</b> <b>time</b> {{during his tenure}} in Leipzig, in 1742. He used movement 4 of the cantata as the base {{for the first of}} his Schübler Chorales, BWV 645.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} a series of dihydroethano- and ethenoanthracene {{derivatives}} on chloroquine (CQ) accumulation in CQ-susceptible strain 3 D 7 and CQ-resistant clone W 2 were assessed. The levels of CQ accumulation increased little or none in CQ-susceptible strain 3 D 7 and generally increased markedly in CQ-resistant strain W 2. At 10 μM, 28 compounds yielded cellular accumulation ratios (CARs) greater than that observed with CQ alone in W 2. At 10 μM, in strain W 2, 21 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs two or <b>more</b> <b>times</b> higher than that of CQ alone, 15 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs three or <b>more</b> <b>times</b> higher than that of CQ alone, 13 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs four or <b>more</b> <b>times</b> higher than that of CQ alone, and 9 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs five or <b>more</b> <b>times</b> higher than that of CQ alone. At 1 μM, 17 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs two or <b>more</b> <b>times</b> higher than that of CQ alone, 12 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs three or <b>more</b> <b>times</b> higher than that of CQ alone, 6 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs four or <b>more</b> <b>times</b> higher than that of CQ alone, and 3 of 31 compounds had CQ CARs five or <b>more</b> <b>times</b> higher than that of CQ alone. At 1 μM, 17 of 31 compounds were more potent inducers of CQ accumulation than verapamil and 12 of 31 compounds were more potent inducers of CQ accumulation than promethazine. The nature of the basic group seems to be associated with increases in the levels of CQ accumulation. At 1 and 10 μM, 10 of 14 and 13 of 14 compounds with amino group (amines and diamines), respectively, had CARs ≥ 3, while at 1 and 10 μM, only 1 of the 13 derivatives with amido groups had CARs ≥ 3. Among 12 of the 31 compounds which were more active inducers of CQ accumulation than promethazine at 1 μM, 10 had amino groups and 1 had an amido group...|$|R
