30|$|The {{transitional}} dynamic {{behavior of}} nailed timber joints {{depends upon the}} composition of the frequency components of input waves, which may be an essential key to understand the actual responsive behavior of timber constructions under earthquakes of various wave characteristics. Timber constructions are composite structural systems composed of multi-members and <b>multi-joints,</b> therefore, the dynamic responsive characteristics of them, which are related to the lateral load-deformation characteristics or the restoring force characteristics of them, are the integrated results of all members and joints. The element dynamic tests of mechanical timber joints, however, are very important because nonlinearity, cyclic degradation and hysteretic damping of timber constructions are generally determined by them.|$|R

For an important {{kind of special}} transfer robot, it is used as automatic material processing equipment in the semiconductor manufacture. The TRCMP has nonlinear, strongly coupled, <b>multi-joints</b> and under actuated, and these characteristics brought some difficulties to model and control. A dynamic model of the TRCMP was based on Lagrange equation and Newton dynamics theory. Then linearization of the dynamics model was done and its state-space equations were established. This structure of the model established is very simple, and it can control the TRCMP effectively and easy. Simulation results proved the system stability, and experiment results analyzed verified that the model of TRCMP is valid and rational...|$|R

40|$|Background Whilst {{arthritis}} {{in other}} affected joints and back pain {{is known to}} lead to worse outcomes following total hip replacement surgery, these risk factors have not previously been operationalized as a musculoskeletal morbidity profile. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the influence of other joints and spine (as grades of musculoskeletal morbidity) on the 1 -year outcome of primary total hip replacement. Methods The European Collaborative Database of Cost and Practice Patterns of Total Hip Replacement study consists of 1, 327 patients receiving primary THR for osteoarthritis across 20 European orthopedic centers. The primary outcome was the responder rate for THR at 12 -months as measured by the relative effect per patient (REPP score), calculated for each patient using the total WOMAC score. The primary predictor of interest was combinations of arthritis of large joints and spine grouped into four musculoskeletal morbidity (MSM) grades: 1 (single-joint), 2 (<b>multi-joints),</b> 3 (single-joint and spine), 4 (<b>multi-joints</b> and spine). Confounders adjusted for were: age, sex, body mass index, living alone, years of hip pain, ASA grade, anxiety/depression, pre-operative WOMAC subscales. Results 845 patients were included for this analysis with complete 12 -month follow-up WOMAC scores. The mean age was 65. 7 years and 55. 2 % were female. Increasing MSM grade was associated with worse outcomes of surgery, where the proportion of patients responding to THR were: 254 (92. 4 %) MSM grade 1, 272 (87. 2 %) MSM grade 2, 46 (80. 7 %) MSM grade 3, 142 (74. 4 %) MSM grade 4. This was confirmed in adjusted logistic regression models: MSM grade 4 vs. 1 relative risk ratio (RRR) 0. 82 95 % confidence interval (CI) (0. 75, 0. 90); MSM grade 3 vs. 1 OR 0. 87 95 %CI (0. 77, 0. 99); MSM grade 2 vs. 1 OR 0. 95 95 %CI (0. 89, 1. 00). Conclusions Other joints and spine measured as musculoskeletal morbidity have a strong influence on the 1 -year outcome after THR. The effect size was large in comparison to other risk factors. Even so, the majority of patients in MSM grade 4 can still profit from surgery (> 75 % response to surgery) ...|$|R

Basically, the main existing LVDM systems can be divided into two categories, i. e. centralized systems and distributed systems, according to the scheme of hardware configuration. By definition, a centralized system is a stand-alone unit which works independently to provide measurements of a spatial point, while a distributed system, is defined as a system that consists of a series of sensors which work cooperatively to provide measurements of a spatial point, and usually individual sensor cannot measure the coordinates separately. Some representative distributed systems in the literature are iGPS, MScMS-II, and etc. The current trend of LVDM systems seem to orient towards distributed systems, and actually, distributed systems demonstrate many advantages that distinguish themselves from conventional centralized system...|$|R

50|$|The key to {{controlling}} a <b>multi-joint</b> robotic fish {{is creating}} a simplified mechanism that is able to generate {{a reasonable amount of}} control. Designers should consider some important factors, including lateral body motions, kinematic data and anatomical data. When designers mimic a BCF-type robot fish, the link-based body wave of the robot fish must provide motions similar to that of a living fish.

50|$|A {{football}} kick is {{the basic}} element of a game of association football. It is a <b>multi-joint</b> movement that involves coordination of primarily muscles of the leg and hip {{as well as other}} stabilizing and neutralizing muscles. A successful football kick requires a combination of power and accuracy and depending on the technique, it can either be powerful or accurate. A greater “swing phase” or foot speed will produce more power relying in force and speed, and the position of the “planted” foot and hip at impact will produce greater accuracy {{in the direction of the}} kick. Kicking performance can be improved by practicing and training soccer-specific strength exercises. This multi articular movement is executed by segmental and joint torques in multiple planes and produces and angular velocity generated from proximal to distal limbs. These are some exercises for each muscle involved in a free kick that will improve balance, force and speed. These are functional exercises that can be done on the field in practice.|$|E

5000|$|Stiffness is {{typically}} {{viewed as a}} material property describing the amount a material deforms under a given force as described by Hooke's law.

Limb stiffness can also be described as the static component of impedance. Humans change the stiffness of their limbs and joints to adapt to their environment. [...] Limb and joint stiffness has been previously studied and can be quantified in various ways. The basic principle for calculating stiffness is dividing the deformation of a limb by the force applied to the limb, however, there are multiple methods of quantifying limb and joint stiffness with various pros and cons.
