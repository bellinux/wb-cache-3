40|$|Twelve {{blood samples}} were {{obtained}} from four male and eight female adult <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> which were raised semi-intensively. The total and differential blood counts as well as study of the blood cellular characteristics were carried out in this study. We report herein that the male <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> had a higher average erythrocyte count (2. 5 x 10 6 /mm 3) than the female <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> (2. 20 x 10 6 /mm 3). The <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> average erythrocyte counts were lower than the average counts reported for temperate breed of ducks but higher than those reported for Nigerian domestic chicken. No {{significant differences in the}} average total leucocyte count between the male and female <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> was observed. The average total leucocytes count for the <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> were higher than those reported for the temperate breeds of ducks and the Nigerian domestic chicken. Higher average lymphocyte count was recorded for the male <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> (72. 75 %) than the female Muscovy ducts (61. 37 %) while a lower basophil average counts was recorded for the male <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> (0. 75 %) than the female <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> (1. 5 %). The esinophils had a diverse number of lobulation on their nucleus and spherical intracytoplasmic granules while the heterophils had an irregular cellular outline and a spindle shaped intracytoplasmic granules.

25|$|Feral <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> can breed near {{urban and}} {{suburban}} lakes and on farms, nesting in tree cavities or on the ground, under shrubs in yards, on apartment balconies, or under roof overhangs. Some feral populations, such as that in Florida, have a reputation of becoming nuisance pests on occasion. At night they often sleep at water, {{if there is a}} water source available, to flee quickly from predators if awoken. A small population of <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> can also be found in Ely, Cambridgeshire, and in Lincoln, Lincolnshire UK. <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> have also been spotted in Walsall Arboretum.

25|$|The <b>Muscovy</b> <b>duck</b> can be crossed with mallards {{in captivity}} to produce hybrids, known as mulard duck ("mule duck") {{because they are}} sterile.

The 40–60% of eggs that are fertile result in birds raised only for their meat or for production of foie gras: they grow fast like mallard-derived breeds but to a large size like Muscovy ducks. Conversely, though crossing Mallard drakes with Muscovy hens is possible, the offspring are neither desirable for meat nor for egg production.|$|E

Escaped or intentionally introduced populations have become established in many suburban areas, {{although they are}} little studied. A total of 642 individual time-activity budgets were collected for invasive <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> in Tampa, Florida, USA, in order to quantify habitat use and behavioural patterns. <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> utilized a variety of cover types, including open water, shoreline, grass, tree, shrub, and urban habitats. <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> foraged by dabbling, gleaning, grazing, and probing, while occasionally obtaining, meals from human sources. They spent about 12 % {{of the time in}} open water, which was used primarily for swimming, foraging, and bathing. Pond shorelines (13 %) were used for roosting at night and for resting and comfort, foraging, and other activities during the day. Grass (42 %) and tree cover (18 %) were important habitats for foraging, while shrubs (8 %) and urban habitats (7 %) were mostly used for resting and comfort activities. Social, reproductive, agnostic, and alert behaviours were also studied. The findings of this study show that free-ranging populations of domesticated <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> are highly adapted to human activity, and they display different habitat usage and nesting habits than their wild counterparts, which occupy forested riparian areas and nest in tree cavities...|$|R

500|$|It {{is widely}} {{agreed that the}} mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is the {{ancestor}} of all breeds of domestic duck (with {{the exception of the}} <b>Muscovy</b> <b>duck</b> (Cairina moschata), which is not closely related to other ducks). Ducks are farmed mainly for their meat, eggs, and down. As is the case with chickens, various breeds have been developed, selected for egg-laying ability, fast growth, and a well-covered carcase. The most common commercial breed in the United Kingdom and the United States is the Pekin duck, which can lay 200 eggs a year and can reach a weight of [...] in 44 days. In the Western world, ducks are not as popular as chickens, because the latter produce larger quantities of white, lean meat and are easier to keep intensively, making the price of chicken meat lower than that of duck meat. While popular in haute cuisine, duck appears less frequently in the mass-market food industry. However, things are different in the East. Ducks are more popular there than chickens and are mostly still herded in the traditional way and selected for their ability to find sufficient food in harvested rice fields and other wet environments.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the productive performance of Sudani ducks (local breed) {{in comparison with}} <b>Muscovy</b> <b>ducks</b> (imported breed) this experiment was conducted during summer season in Egypt. A total number of 24 Sudani (Cairina moschata) and 24 Muscovy (Cairina moschata) ducklings (3 weeks old) were used in this study, to evaluate some productive traits including growth performance and carcass characteristics. The results revealed that body weight gain of Muscovy breed was significantly higher by 27. 22 % than Sudani breed at 3 - 12 weeks of age. Meanwhile, Muscovy ducklings consumed more feed at 3 - 12 weeks of age than Sudani breed. Feed conversion was better in Muscovy (4. 37) than Sudani (5. 25) ducks. The results also indicated that percentage of inedible parts and dressing and deboning percentage were approximately similar in both breeds. Percentage of giblets in Sudani ducks {{was significantly higher than}} in Muscovy, while percentage of carcass fat, breast and drumsticks were significantly higher in Muscovy compared to Sudani ducks.

2500|$|The {{production}} of foie gras occurs on the pretext that migrating wildfowl seasonally eat such that their liver naturally enlarges. [...] However, the bird used predominantly in foie gras production is {{a hybrid of}} a male <b>Muscovy</b> <b>duck</b> and a female Pekin duck. [...] It has been noted that the <b>Muscovy</b> <b>duck</b> is non-migratory, and both the Pekin and the mulard hybrid cannot fly. Domestic ducks (including the Pekin) are derived from the mallard duck, which is sometimes migratory and sometimes not. Therefore, although the domestic goose might well be adapted to store food before migration, it is less likely that the Mulard hybrid duck has the same potential.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Muscovy</b> <b>duck</b> {{has been}} domesticated for centuries, and is widely traded as [...] "Barbary duck". Muscovy breeds are popular {{because they have}} stronger-tasting meat—sometimes {{compared}} to roasted beef—than the usual domestic ducks which are descendants of the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). The meat is lean {{when compared to the}} fatty meat of mallard-derived ducks, its leanness and tenderness being often compared to veal. Muscovy ducks are also less noisy, and sometimes marketed as a [...] "quackless" [...] duck; even though they are not completely silent, they don't actually quack (except in cases of extreme stress). The carcass of a <b>Muscovy</b> <b>duck</b> is also much heavier than most other domestic ducks, which makes it ideal for the dinner table.|$|E
