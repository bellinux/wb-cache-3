5|$|It is also {{possible}} for erectile dysfunction to exist not {{as a direct result}} of SCI but due to factors such as <b>major</b> <b>depression,</b> diabetes, or drugs such as those taken for spasticity. Finding and treating the root cause may alleviate the problem. For example, men who experience erectile problems as the result of a testosterone deficiency can receive androgen replacement therapy.|$|E

40|$|The Author(s) 2011. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract To elucidate a genetic predisposition to major depressive disorder, we investigated two polymorphisms (− 31 T/C and − 511 C/T) in the interleukin- 1 beta promoter region {{in patients who}} suffered from <b>major</b> recurrent <b>depression.</b> The aim of the current work was to compare alleles and genotype layout between patients with <b>major</b> recurrent <b>depression</b> and healthy people. We would like to indicate such combination of genotypes which corresponds with <b>major</b> recurrent <b>depression.</b> Correlations between genotypes for analyzed polymorphisms and number of episodes, number of points in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and age of onset were investigated as well. The study group consisted of 94 patients diagnosed with <b>major</b> recurrent <b>depression.</b> The control group included 206 healthy individuals. Both groups involved representatives of Caucasian population. Genotyping of polymorphisms was performed by using PCR-RFLP technique.

5|$|Lithium {{is useful}} in the {{treatment}} of bipolar disorder. Lithium salts may also be helpful for related diagnoses, such as schizoaffective disorder and cyclic <b>major</b> <b>depression.</b> The active part of these salts is the lithium ion Li+.

5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated {{in people with}} myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In <b>major</b> <b>depression,</b> they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history of}} alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.|$|E
5|$|Drake {{suffered}} from <b>major</b> <b>depression,</b> {{and this was}} often reflected in his lyrics.

5|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD), {{also known}} simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by {{at least two weeks}} of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2–7% of adults with <b>major</b> <b>depression</b> die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.|$|E

25|$|There {{are a few}} {{scattered}} uninhabited small oases, usually {{linked to}} the <b>major</b> <b>depressions,</b> where water can be found by digging to a few feet in depth. In the west there is a widely dispersed group of oases in unconnected shallow depressions, the Kufra group, consisting of Tazerbo, Rebianae and Kufra. Aside from the scarps, the general flatness is only interrupted {{by a series of}} plateaus and massifs near the centre of the Libyan Desert, around the convergence of the Egyptian-Sudanese-Libyan borders.|$|R
40|$|The {{changes in}} plasma protein sulphydryl level were {{measured}} {{during the course}} of adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. <b>Major</b> <b>depressions</b> in the plasma sulphydryl level occurred at the onset of adjuvant disease, and the extent of the depression was related to the severity of the disease. Plasma sulphydryl levels remain unchanged when the systemic arthritis is suppressed by inclusion of a competing antigen in the adjuvant.

50|$|A {{person who}} suffers from severe humiliation could {{experience}} <b>major</b> <b>depressions,</b> suicidal states, and severe anxiety states such as post-traumatic stress disorder. The loss of status, like losing a job or being labeled as a liar or discredited unfairly, could cause people inability to behave normally in their communities. Humiliated individuals could be provoked and crave for revenge, and some people could feel worthless, hopeless and helpless, creating suicidal thoughts if justice is not met. It also can lead to new insights, activism and a new kinship with marginalized groups.|$|R

50|$|From the 1820s {{economic}} growth was based increasingly upon {{the production of}} fine wool and other rural commodities for markets in Britain and the industrializing economies of Northwestern Europe. To finance this trade a number of banks set up in London in the 1830s, including the Bank of Australasia in 1835 and the Union Bank of Australia established in 1837. This growth was interrupted by two <b>major</b> <b>depressions</b> during the 1840s and 1890s and stimulated in complex ways by the rich gold discoveries in Victoria in 1851, but the underlying dynamics were essentially unchanged.|$|R
50|$|The {{third of}} four <b>major</b> <b>depressions</b> {{for the month}} arrived in western Victoria on the 17th and {{produced}} very heavy falls upon already-saturated catchments on flat land where water was not draining away quickly. As the slow-moving depression linked with warm air from the Tasman Sea, thunderstorms began to develop over the Wimmera region on the 18th. Rich Avon recorded 50mm (2 inches) from one of these whilst in the Great Divide {{there were reports that}} some areas had received as much as 100mm (4 inches) in as little as six hours.|$|R
50|$|Recurrent <b>major</b> <b>depressions</b> in {{the world}} economy at the pace of 20 and 50 years {{have been the subject of}} studies since Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi (1773-1842) {{provided}} the first theory of crisis in a critique of classical political economy's assumption of equilibrium between supply and demand. Developing an economic crisis theory became the central recurring concept throughout Karl Marx's mature work. Marx's law of the tendency for the rate of profit to fall borrowed many features of the presentation of John Stuart Mill's discussion Of the Tendency of Profits to a Minimum (Principles of Political Economy Book IV Chapter IV). The theory is a corollary of the Tendency towards the Centralization of Profits.|$|R

40|$|There are now 15 {{effective}} antidepressant medicines marketed in Canada (eight tricyclic antidepressants, three {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitors, and four medicines with novel chemical structures). The tricyclics remain the drug of first choice for <b>major</b> <b>depressions,</b> {{because of their}} proven efficacy over three decades, their known side effect profiles, and the cheaper cost of imipramine and amitriptyline compared to other tricyclics and the new antidepressants. The monoamine oxidase inhibitors are an excellent alternative, and are far safer than earlier reports suggested. Maprotiline offers few advantages over the tricyclics and costs significantly more. Trazodone may be a second- or third-line drug with the advantage of minimal anticholinergic properties. Adequate clinical evaluation of nomifensine has not yet occurred. Neuroleptic and cardiotoxic properties of amoxapine suggest other medicines should be tried first...|$|R
50|$|Two <b>major</b> <b>depressions</b> hit {{the race}} and caused a record fifty retirements.

Tony Bullimore was rescued by a passing ship after his boat caught fire. The race also suffered two fatalities, the first in its history. Englishman Mike Flanagan, brother of renowned sculptor Barry Flanagan, was lost overboard from Galloping Gael. A particularly sad story was that of Mike McMullen, whose wife Lizzie was electrocuted and killed while helping him to prepare Three Cheers for the race, just {{two days before the}} start. Believing that Lizzie would have wanted him to go on, he started the race, but was never seen again.|$|R

40|$|A {{renaissance of}} electroconvulsive therapy in {{psychiatry}} {{can be observed}} in Germany. Here, ECT was named as a first line therapy for treating psychotic depression, depressive stupor, schizoaffective psychoses with severe depressive symptoms. Suprisingly, ECT is most commonly not used as a continuation therapy after achieving acute remission. With rare exceptions, antidepressive medication is chosen for this purpose. The use of continuation ECT (cECT) and subsequent maintenance ECT (mECT) is not (or just marginally) mentioned in practice guidelines. In our case report we report a successful cECT and mECT of a geriatric patient with severe comorbidity. This case is exemplified with respect to recent guidelines and study results. Particularly suggestions for interval duration, total duration of treatment, effects on cognition and memory, comorbidity and comedication, and reflections on quality of life and costs were discussed. We would therefore recommend a broader use of this proven treatment tool for keeping <b>major</b> <b>depressions</b> in remission...|$|R
