50|$|Vegetable {{farming is}} the growing of {{vegetables}} for human consumption. The practice probably started in several {{parts of the world}} over ten thousand years ago, with families growing vegetables for their own consumption or to trade locally. At first manual labour was used but in time livestock were domesticated and the ground could be turned by the plough. More recently, mechanisation has revolutionised vegetable farming with nearly all processes being able to be performed by <b>machine.</b> <b>Specialist</b> producers grow the particular crops that do well in their locality. New methods such as aquaponics, Raised-bed gardening|raised beds and cultivation under glass are used. Marketing can be done locally in farmer's markets, traditional markets or pick-your-own operations, or farmers can contract their whole crops to wholesalers, canners or retailers.|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{potential}} of the European construction industry in the field of additive manufacturing technology (AM) and its application for construction components, the authors of this paper promoted the consortium AMforBE, committed with gathering scientific experts in AM and specialised producers of building systems/components. It also involves researchers in testing and certification processes, building product manufacturing optimisation methodology, AM <b>machine</b> <b>specialists,</b> robot engineering etc., and institutions specialised in technology transfer and academic entrepreneurship. The consortium therefore merges the know-how and the complementary skills of actors in academics, multi-national companies, small and medium sized enterprises, and national research agencies. This paper targets the potentials of AM for the built environment and the related industry – to identify potentials of the technology in real-world implementation for design and engineering process and construction. Drivers for these potentials are energy reduction in production, integrated products, individualized applications and the potential for small and middle size companies being able to participate in high quality production with limited investments in hardware. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Turkish {{aviation}} {{has started}} as a military entity. The foundation of ‘’Tayyare Komisyonu’’ (Airplane Comission) in June 1, 1911 has been accepted as the official starting point. The organization of aviation includes pilot training, airplane supply, fondation of aviation school, establishment of combatant units, and building the air vehicles with local and national endeavour. Later, air defense systems, meteorology, training observers, <b>machine</b> <b>specialist</b> and technicians has gained importance as well. Turkish aviation has been built upon {{the ruins of the}} last wars of Ottoman Empire. After the invasion of the British and the French, Ottoman aviators moved to Maltepe and then to various parts of Anatolia eventually. During the Independence War, aviation school was founded in Eskişehir, moved to Adana, Konya, and came back to Adana again. After the Greek forces were expelled from Anatolia via İzmir, aviation school was moved to İzmir. In 1925, it was brought back to Eskişehir on October 1, 1951. After WWII, the duration of training in order to be a pilot was six years. In 1929, aviation school {{turned out to be an}} academic institution as well. On October 1, 1951, Air Force Academy was established in Eskişehir. Due to high sound of jet air planes, the academy was moved to İzmir in 1954. Education and training were restructured there and the quality was raised. In 1967, Air Force Academy was moved back to Yeşilköy where Turkish aviation was born some 47 years ago. Due to academic diversity and rich culture heritage, a productive period has started in Istanbul. Air Force Academy has been an institution offering BA level education since 2001 whose process goes back to 1990 s. Around 90 civilian and 50 military academicians conduct education and research per year. Military training including Yalova encampment site, affective domain training, and sports activities are also conducted as well. With a 103 years history and around 16. 000 graduates, Turkish Air Force Academy trains the staff who will safeguard the Turkish skies.

Res. 19 (4) : 000 ± 000. 2005. —Many commonly utilized low-back exercise devices offer mechanisms {{to stabilize the}} pelvis and to isolate the lumbar spine, but {{the value of these}} mecha-nisms remains unclear. The {{purpose of this study was}} to ex-amine the effect of pelvic stabilization on the activity of the lum-bar and hip extensor muscles during dynamic back extension exercise. Fifteen volunteers in good general health performed dynamic extension exercise in a seated upright position on a lumbar extension machine with and without pelvic stabilization. During exercise, surface electromyographic activity of the lum-bar multifidus and biceps femoris was recorded. The activity of the multifidus was 51 % greater during the stabilized condition, whereas there was no difference in the activity of the biceps femoris between conditions.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} machinery for automated biological image acquisition has introduced {{the need for}} effective algorithms for biological image analysis and classification. These enabling algorithms are constantly being developed by pattern recognition and machine vision experts, who tailor and adjust general computer vision methods to {{the specific needs of}} biological imaging. However, in many real-life cases, <b>machine</b> vision <b>specialists</b> do not have convenient access to biological datasets {{that can be used for}} developing and testing their algorithms, or comparing the algorithm performance with a defined baseline. In other cases, computer science experts do not work closely with biologists, who are better able to define the biological problems as well as direct research towards effective and practical solutions. Here we propose a benchmark suite of biological datasets that can be used by machine vision experts who wish to develop algorithms for biological imaging. This collection represents a set of practical real-life imaging problems in biology, and offers examples of cells, tissues and organisms imaged at different magnifications with different contrast techniques.

50|$|The {{rank and}} file of the legion was {{composed}} of three basic classes of foot soldier. The miletis was the common soldier, enlisted in hard labor. The discens was the mid-level {{rank and file}} member, training in a specialized field, but not yet a specialist. The immunes was {{the highest level of}} foot soldier. The necessity for a legion to undertake tasks such as bridge building or engineering siege <b>machines</b> required such <b>specialists,</b> whose skilled trades gave them privileged status, granting them higher pay and allowing them to be 'excused from regular duties'. Among them would be medical staff, surveyors, carpenters, veterinaries, hunters, armourers - even soothsayers and priests. When the legion was on the march, the chief duty of the surveyors would be to go ahead of the army, perhaps with a cavalry detachment, and to seek out the best place for the night's camp.In the forts along the empire's frontiers other non-combatant men could be found. An entire bureaucracy was necessary to keep the army running; immunes members of the legion were not only the engineers and the technicians, but also the scribes, supervisors, and police in charge of army pay, supplies and customs.|$|R
40|$|The {{arrival of}} a student who is Blind in the School of Systems Engineering at the University of Reading has made it an {{interesting}} and challenging year for all. Visually impaired students have already graduated from other Schools of the University and the School of Systems Engineering has seen three students with visual impairment graduate recently with good degrees. These students could access materials - and do assessments - essentially by means of enlargement and judicious choice of options. The new student had previously been supported by a specialist college. She is a proficient typist and also a user of both Braille and JAWS screen reader, and she is doing a joint course in Cybernetics and Computer Science. The course requires mathematics which itself includes graphs, and also many diagrams including numerous circuit diagrams. The University bought proven equipment such as a scanner to process books into speech or Braille, and screen reading software {{as well as a}} <b>specialist</b> <b>machine</b> for producing tactile diagrams for educational use. Clearly it is also important that the student can access assessments and examinations and present answers for marking or feedback (by sighted staff).

Artillery was only sporadically supplied due to a general shortage, though Faisal would have several batteries of mountain guns under French Captain Pisani and his Algerians for the Megiddo Campaign. [...] Egyptian and Indian troops also served with the Revolt, primarily as <b>machine</b> gunners and <b>specialist</b> troops, a number of armoured cars were allocated for use.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to explore the use of machine learning to assist in the development of knowledge-based systems (KBS) in dairy farming. A framework was first developed which described the various types of management and control activities in dairy farming and the types of information flows among these activities. This framework provided a basis for the creation of computerized information systems and helped to identify the analysis of group-average lactation curves as a promising area of application. A case-acquisition and decision-support system was developed to assist a domain specialist in generating example cases for <b>machine</b> learning. The <b>specialist</b> classified data from 33 herds enrolled with the Quebec dairy herd analysis service, resulting in 1428 lactations and 7684 tests of individual cows, classified as outlier or non-outlier, and 99 interpretations of group-average lactation curves. To enable the performance analysis of classifiers, generated with machine learning from these small data sets, a method was established involving cross-validation runs, relative operating characteristic curves, and analysis of variance. In experiments to filter lactations and tests, classification performance was significantly affected by preprocessing of examples, creation of additional attributes, choice of machine-learning algorithm, and algorithm configuration. For the filtering of individual tests, naive-Bayes classification showed significantly better performance than decision-tree induction. However, the specialist considered the decision trees as more transparent than the knowledge generated with naive Bayes. The creation of a series of three classifiers with increased sensitivity at the expense of reduced specificity per classification task, allows users of a final KBS to choose the desired tendency of classifying new cases as abnormal. For the main interpretation tasks, satisfactory performance was achieved. For the filtering tasks, performance was fa...|$|R
500|$|As a raiding force, the Commandos {{were not}} issued the heavy weapons {{of a normal}} {{infantry}} battalion. The weapons used were the standard British Army small arms of the time; most riflemen carried the Lee–Enfield rifle and section fire support {{was provided by the}} Bren light machine gun. The Thompson was the submachine gun of choice, but later in the war the Commandos also used the cheaper and lighter Sten gun. Commando sections were equipped with a higher number of Bren and Thompson guns than a normal British infantry section. The Webley Revolver was initially used as the standard sidearm, but it was eventually replaced by the Colt 45 pistol, which used the same ammunition as the Thompson submachine gun. One weapon specifically designed for the Commandos was the De Lisle carbine. Modelled on the Lee–Enfield rifle and fitted with a silencer, it used the same [...]45 cartridge as the Thompson and was designed to eliminate sentries during Commando raids. Some were used and proved successful on operations, but the nature of the Commando role had changed before they were put into full production and the order for their purchase was cancelled. [...] The Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife was designed especially for Commandos' use in hand-to-hand combat, replacing the BC-41 knuckleduster/dagger, although a whole range of clubs and knives were used in the field. Some of the heavier and crew–served weapons used included the Boys anti-tank rifle and the 2-inch mortar for indirect fire support. After 1943, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank, known as the PIAT, replaced the now obsolete Boys anti-tank rifle. With the formation of the heavy weapons troops, Commandos were issued the 3-inch mortar and the Vickers machine gun. The issue of the medium Vickers machine gun to Commando units set them apart from typical British Army infantry divisions, who tended to only employ the weapon in <b>specialist</b> <b>machine</b> gun battalions.|$|R
