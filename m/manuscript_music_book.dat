40|$|This study {{concerns}} the <b>manuscript</b> <b>music</b> <b>book</b> of Robert Edward (c. 1614 –c. 1697), minister, author and musician. The manuscript, formerly {{part of the}} library at Panmure House, is now held in the National Library of Scotland and is {{commonly referred to as}} ‘Robert Edward’s Commonplace Book’ (GB-En MS. 9450). The present study is in two parts and begins with an exploration of the physical book, including the structure, compilation, hands and ownership before a second chapter explores the biography of the eponymous owner, contextualising GB-En MS. 9450 locally and nationally. The third chapter {{concerns the}} function of the manuscript which, it is argued, is closely related to pedagogy. The final three chapters discuss the content of the manuscript, taking in turn the vocal music, instrumental music and the selection of Italian three-part villanelle.

40|$|This {{collection}} {{consists of}} eighteen printed and <b>manuscript</b> <b>music</b> <b>books</b> owned {{by members of}} the Austen family, including the writer Jane Austen, in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Many are binder’s volumes, compiled from separate manuscript or printed sheet music items bound together for an individual user. Others are personal manuscript albums made wholly or principally by a single copyist. Although some volumes were compiled as early as the 1750 s, the majority date from Jane Austen’s lifetime (1775 - 1817). Austen made or used several of the books, and she was probably familiar with music collected by other family members. The collection brings together nearly 600 pieces, mainly songs and works for keyboard or harp, by both international figures and British composers. The books present a vivid picture of domestic musical culture in England in the years around 1800, furnishing valuable insights on music making in the homes of gentry families as well as essential contextualisation for musical episodes in Austen’s fiction...|$|R

40|$|Documentation {{in music}} implies {{a great variety}} of {{physical}} objects: <b>music</b> <b>manuscripts,</b> printed <b>music,</b> <b>books</b> and periodicals on music, sound recordings and audiovisuals - analogic and digital - musical instruments and other objects related to a music career, works of visual arts with subject music.
