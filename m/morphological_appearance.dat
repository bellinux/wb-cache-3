25|$|As worker ants grow {{to larger}} sizes, {{the shape of}} the head changes, due to the head length growing {{at the same time as}} the total body length, and the head width may grow by 20%. The length of the {{antennae}} only grows slowly; the antennae may only grow 60% longer by the time the body doubles its length, thus the relative antennal length decreases by 20% as the length of the body doubles. All individual legs of the body are isometric with body length meaning that even when the length of the body doubles, the legs will also double. However, not all of the legs are the same length; the prothoracic portion accounts for 29% of leg length, the mesothoracic 31%, and the metathoracic 41%. The first two pairs of legs are of equal length to one another, whereas the final pair is longer. Overall, the <b>morphological</b> <b>appearance</b> of a worker changes dramatically when it grows larger. The head exhibits the greatest shape change and the height of the alinotum grows quicker than its length, where a height/length ratio of 0.27 in minor workers and 0.32 in major workers is seen. Due to this, larger workers tend to have a humped-shape and robust alinotum in contrast to smaller workers. No petiole segment exhibits any change in shape as the size of the body changes. The width of the gaster grows more rapidly than its length, where the width may be 96% of its length but increases to 106%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Morphological</b> <b>appearance</b> {{is judged}} by human {{operators}} {{and is therefore}} subject to large inter operator variation. Several CTC enumeration methods exist which use <b>morphological</b> <b>appearance</b> to identify CTC, which may also apply different morphological criteria. A recent study in prostate cancer showed that many different morphological definitions of circulating tumor cells have similar prognostic value, even though the absolute number of cells found in patients and normal donors varied {{by more than a}} decade between different morphological definitions.|$|E

25|$|Mineralogists, in particular, are {{interested}} in <b>morphological</b> <b>appearances</b> of individual crystals, {{as defined by the}} actually formed crystal faces (tracht) and their relative sizes (habit).

50|$|The <b>morphological</b> <b>appearance</b> can {{be helpful}} in {{determining}} the cause of a periosteal reaction (for example, if other features of periostitis are present), but is usually not enough to be definitive. Diagnosis can be helped by establishing if bone formation is localized to a specific point or generalized to a broad area. The appearance of the adjacent bone will give clues as to which of these is the most likely cause.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, an agonal {{heart rhythm}} is {{a variant of}} {{asystole}} in which occasional P waves and QRS complexes {{can be seen on}} the electrocardiogram. The complexes tend to be wide and bizarre in <b>morphological</b> <b>appearance.</b> Clinically, an agonal rhythm is regarded as asystole and should be treated equivalently, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and administration of intravenous adrenaline. As in asystole, the prognosis for a patient presenting with this rhythm is very poor.|$|E
50|$|Cells depend {{for their}} {{survival}} on stimulation that is mediated by various receptors and sensors.

50|$|The term {{parachute}} {{mitral valve}} {{stems from the}} <b>morphological</b> <b>appearance</b> of the valve; that is to say, the mitral valve leaflets appear as the canopy of the parachute, the chordae as the strings and the papillary muscle as the harness. As in the normal human heart, there exists two mitral valve leaflets, each with their own set of chordae. Unique to the parachute mitral valve is that the chordae insert on one papillary muscle, rather than two distinct papillary muscles. Often, the chordae are short and thick and this combination of factors leads to restricted movement of the mitral valve leaflets and obstruction of blood flow into the left ventricle.|$|E
5000|$|The PSPP is {{impossible}} to estimate reliably by eye because outward appearance, especially of stock withdrawn from refrigerated storage, can deceive even experienced foresters, who would be offended if their ability were questioned to recognize good planting stock when they saw it. Prior to Wakeley's (1954) demonstration {{of the importance of}} the physiological state of planting stock in determining the ability of the stock to perform after outplanting, and to a considerable extent even afterwards, <b>morphological</b> <b>appearance</b> has generally served as the basis for estimating the quality of planting stock. Gradually, however, a realization developed that more was involved. Tucker et al. (1968), for instance, after assessing 10-year survival data from several experimental white spruce plantations in Manitoba noted that [...] "Perhaps the most important point revealed here is that certain lots of transplants performed better than others", even though all transplants were handled and planted with care. The intuitive [...] "stock that looks good must be good" [...] is a persuasive, but potentially dangerous maxim. That greatest of teachers, Bitter Experience, has often enough demonstrated the fallibility of such assessment, even though the corollary [...] "stock that looks bad must be bad" [...] is likely to be well founded. The physiological qualities of planting stock are hidden from the eye and must be revealed by testing. The potential for survival and growth of a batch of planting stock may be estimated from various features, morphological and physiological, of the stock or a sample thereof.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Morphological</b> <b>appearance</b> of {{the wolves}} from {{different}} parts of India shows certain dissimilarities. Skulls of the two males from Chumar, Ladakh were measured by Allen (234 and 236 mm), which are the largest for wolves in India, but smaller compared to North American wolves, which can measure up to 290 mm. Canis lupus pallipes has the smallest skull length, measuring maximum up to 220 mm. Zygomatic widths of the skull of wolves from Ladakh (129 and 128 mm) were also comparatively larger than those of peninsular wolves from India (90.2-109 mm). Upper cheek teeth, i.e. canine to last molar of two wolves from Ladakh measured 105 and 98.4 mm, which is larger compared to those of peninsular wolves and Arabian wolves (93.6-97 mm and 81.3-93 mm respectively)14-16. The wolf from peninsular India appears smaller in size and more brownish in colour, whereas wolves from the Himalayan regions are large and whitish. Peninsular wolf weighs 25 kg on an average, which may be the lowest among all wolves, whereas wolves from the Himalayan region weigh about 35 kg, similar to Tibetan wolves. The wolves from Upper Mustang, Nepal are characterized by their [...] "distinct white coloration around the throat, chest, belly and inner part of the legs; woolliness of body fur; stumpy legs; unusual elongation of the muzzle, a muzzle arrayed with closely-spaced black speckles which extend below the eye on to the upper cheeks and ears; and smaller size compared to the European wolf." ...|$|E

40|$|Objective We {{propose a}} Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guided {{approach}} to differential diagnosis of ovarian tumours based on <b>morphological</b> <b>appearance.</b> Background Characterization of ovarian lesions {{is of great}} importance in order to plan adequate therapeutic procedures, and may influence patient’s management. Optimal assessment of adnexal masses requires a multidisciplinary approach, based on physical examination, laboratory tests and imaging techniques. Primary ovarian tumours can be classified into three main categories according to tumour origin: epithelial, germ cell and sex cord-stromal tumours.

The high frequency and <b>morphological</b> <b>appearances</b> suggest abnormal cusp movement and resultant valve trauma rather than a primary valve abnormality. The functional abnormality leading to secondary valve changes is presumably related to increased flow and altered left ventricular geometry but cannot be studied in the dead heart...|$|R
