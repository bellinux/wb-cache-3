500|$|The [...] {{advent of}} war in September 1939 did not {{diminish}} Gibbons's creative energy. In November she {{began a series of}} articles, [...] "A Woman's Diary of the War", for St Martin's Review, the journal of the London church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The series ran until November 1943, and includes many of Gibbons's private reflections on the conflict. In October 1941 she wrote: [...] "he war has done <b>me</b> <b>good...</b> I get a dour satisfaction out of managing the rations, salvaging, fire watching, and feeling that I am trying to work for a better world". In July 1940 Webb enlisted in the Middlesex Regiment, and the following year was commissioned into the King's Royal Rifle Corps. He later served overseas, mostly in Cairo.|$|E
500|$|The single's lyrics cover {{a variety}} of issues, ranging from [...] "body image, class division, an unhappy {{marriage}} and alcoholism". [...] "Ugly" [...] opens with Fantasia narrating a tragic story about {{a woman with a}} “picket fence, two-car garage and a man that she don’t love”. The narrative's rural setting is established through the lyrics, “Gimme that rusty old grain silo”. Fantasia advocates for female empowerment and explores expectations regarding beauty with lyrics like: [...] "With dirt on my hands and scrapes on my knees/Feeling like nothing can wash it off clean/Tell your girls it’s a beautiful thing/Just trust me/It’s far from ugly.” The lyrics also feature the importance of love, with Fantasia singing, “Thank you for that good good man who loves me.” Alex Mcpherson interpreted Fantasia's delivery of the lyric “Give <b>me</b> <b>good</b> food that sticks to my bones” as incorporating gospel elements into the song. [...] "Ugly" [...] ends with Fantasia discussing her life immediately after winning the third season of American Idol.|$|E
500|$|Leicester formed {{his army}} over a deep, narrow way, with the {{elevation}} where the Dutch were entrenched behind. He deployed his cavalry in two squadrons, formed a large infantry battalion, put 300 or 350 advanced pikemen under Sir William Stanley and Lord Audley {{next to the}} way, and flanked the road with sleeves of musketeers and arquebusiers. As the morning on 22 September was very misty, the English met the convoy before they expected. The Spanish cavalry opened the way followed by a battalion of foot, two sleeves of musketeers flanking the wagons, and some cavalry closing the way. Del Vasto left part of his cavalry near Lochem to guard {{the rear of the}} convoy. At 8:00am, when the Spanish, led by the Marquis del Vasto himself, had passed Warnsveld, Stanley and Lord Audley began to skirmish with the Spanish vanguard. After the first clashes, the Earl of Essex charged upon the Spanish with the English cavalry, crying [...] "Follow <b>me,</b> <b>good</b> fellows, for the honour of England and of England's Queen!" ...|$|E

500|$|After his {{appearances}} in London Solti went to Switzerland {{to seek out}} Toscanini, who was conducting in Lucerne. Solti hoped that Toscanini would help find him a post in the US. He was unable to do so, but Solti found work and security in Switzerland as vocal coach to the tenor Max Hirzel, who was learning the role of Tristan in Wagner's opera. Throughout the Second World War, Solti remained in Switzerland. He did not see his father again: Mor Stern died of diabetes in a Budapest hospital in 1943. Solti was reunited {{with his mother and}} sister after the war. In Switzerland he could not obtain a work permit as a conductor, but earned his living as a piano teacher. After he won the 1942 Geneva International Piano Competition he was permitted to give piano recitals, but was still not allowed to conduct. During his exile, he met Hedwig (Hedi) Oeschli, daughter of a lecturer at Zürich University. They married in 1946. In his memoirs he wrote of her, [...] "She was very elegant and sophisticated. ... Hedi gave me a little grace and taught <b>me</b> <b>good</b> manners– although she never completely succeeded in this. She also helped me enormously in my career".|$|E

Unlike every other band in rock we chose to be anonymous. The answer that makes <b>me</b> sound <b>good</b> would probably also incorporate some lengthy discussion about Brechtian alienation techniques, about our post modernistgrasp of ever cooling universe, and a dehumanising society encapsulated in the somewhat paramilitary aspect of our clothing. All of those things would make <b>me</b> sound <b>good,</b> but actually we’re really boring guys." [...] Humphrey B. Flaubert ...|$|R

[...] But if an emperor and his subordinates were like fish and water, the empire will have peace. [...] Emperor Gaozu of Han {{was but a}} farmer, but he conquered the empire carrying just a short sword.

2500|$|On 13 June 1842, Blacket and his {{new wife}} left England on the {{passenger}} vessel Eden, bound for Sydney, but with New Zealand as their intended final destination. Blacket later wrote, [...] "Neither my Father or Mother would bid <b>me</b> <b>good</b> bye, so my old Uncle offered to see us off." [...] He had letters of introduction to prominent residents of Sydney, including Sir Charles Nicholson, Thomas Sutcliffe Mort and a recommendation to Bishop William Grant Broughton from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Blacket suffered from sea-sickness for the first month, although Sarah did not. After about 55 days the ship called at Bahia in Brazil, where he made sketches of church doors and other items that interested him. He also acquired a marmoset monkey which disturbed his sketching {{for the rest of}} the voyage. He spent the rest of the voyage carving a wooden crucifix.|$|E

2500|$|Certain Germans helped {{prisoners in}} their escape attempts. During his second try, Robert d'Harcourt hid in a warehouse, where a German found him. The latter did not {{denounce}} him, instead helping him {{leave the city}} that night: “ then he guided me across a maze of back-alleys and yards, through which I would never have found my way alone, until {{the entrance to a}} street where he left me, not without first vigorously shaking my hand and wishing <b>me</b> <b>good</b> luck." [...] The sympathy of women is equally remarked upon by Riou and d'Harcourt. Once the escape was successful, the prisoner was sent to his regimental barracks to undergo an interrogation. In effect, the home authorities had to make sure the escape was authentic and not a spy trick. If the operation failed, the escapee was taken back to the camp to be punished. The frustration generated by failure very often led the recaptured prisoner to develop plans for the next attempt; this was the case for Charles de Gaulle and Robert d’Harcourt. Of 313,400 escapes counted for the war’s duration, 67,565 succeeded.|$|E
2500|$|Stone grew up {{listening}} {{to a wide variety of}} music including 1960s and 1970s American R and soul music performed by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. [...] "My first CD that I owned was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, 'Oh yeah, that looks really good', so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, 'Can I have that for Christmas?' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets <b>me</b> <b>good</b> music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved." [...] She would later tell MTV News: [...] "I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You've got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little." ...|$|E
2500|$|Singing differs {{by region}} in {{that a high}} falsetto {{is used in the}} north while in the south a lower range is used. [...] "To the {{unfamiliar}} listener, Indian singing sounds exotic, different, and difficult to comprehend," [...] and the contrast in the quality or timbre of voice used in traditional Indian and European musics may {{have much to do with}} that difficulty. However, [...] "to the trained ear, melodies flow, ascend and descend" [...] while dancers react to changes in the structure of the melody and the song. Boye Ladd says, [...] "If you give me a stink song, I'll dance stink. If you give <b>me</b> <b>good</b> music, I'll give you a great show," [...] implying that one can appreciate the music through the dancing, which is readily appreciated by everyone. But others say that today's contemporary contest dancers are expected to dance their best no matter how well or poor the drum group is that is singing for their contest. Generally, Native American singing follows a pentatonic scale (as if playing only the black keys on a piano) and while, to the outsider, it may sound like we're just pounding a drum and going [...] "Heya-heya-heya-heya" [...] sometimes there are actual words in Cree, Pikuni, Lushuutsid, Niimipuu, Lakhota, Sahpatin, Salish, Ojibwemowin or many other Native languages.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{coming out}} as a lesbian, Bianca's romantic {{entanglements}} have consisted of sexual confusion, unrequited love, bad timing, and betrayal, including a short-lived romance with Lena Kundera (Olga Sosnovska) and an on-but-mostly-off-screen romantic relationship with Maggie Stone (Elizabeth Hendrickson). The pairing of Reese and Bianca finally allowed the character to be scripted into an on-screen committed relationship. The show had been criticized {{in the past for}} not giving Bianca a full-fledged on-screen romance. When asked by The Advocate if she felt Bianca's pairing with Reese, especially by bringing on a recognized name (Braun), would make a difference, Riegel replied, [...] "I think {{there has to be a}} difference." [...] She responded to the criticism about Bianca's lack of onscreen intimacy with past romantic partners. [...] "I don’t know if the criticism is entirely warranted," [...] she said. [...] "I know I was glad that the show’s priority was in giving <b>me</b> <b>good</b> stories, and I thought that they did go further than anyone else had ever gone, so I always thought that they should be commended." [...] Riegel added, however, that she knows the lack of onscreen intimacy between Bianca and the character's past romantic love interests left fans and herself unsatisfied. [...] "She never really got to have the kind of relationship that she deserved," [...] stated Riegel. Riegel said of Bianca's return this time, [...] "you’ll see a couple of things you haven’t seen in a while".|$|E
