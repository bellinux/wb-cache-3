2500|$|<b>Diving</b> <b>suits</b> can {{be divided}} into two classes: [...] "soft" [...] or ambient {{pressure}} <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> - examples are wetsuits, dry suits, semi-dry <b>suits</b> and <b>dive</b> skins, and [...] "hard" [...] or atmospheric pressure <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> - armored suits that keep the diver at atmospheric pressure at any depth within the operating range of the suit.|$|R

By 1979, a team from Oceaneering assisted Dr. Sylvia Earle in testing the application of Atmospheric <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> for scientific <b>diving</b> operations by <b>diving</b> a JIM <b>suit</b> to 1,250 fsw. Oceaneering also used WASP atmospheric <b>diving</b> <b>suits.</b>|$|R
25|$|A <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> is {{a garment}} or device {{designed}} to protect a diver from the underwater environment. A <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> may also incorporate a breathing gas supply (i.e. Standard diving dress or atmospheric <b>diving</b> <b>suit).</b> {{but in most cases}} applies only to the environmental protective covering worn by the diver. The breathing gas supply is usually referred to separately. There is no generic term for the combination of suit and breathing apparatus alone. It is generally referred to as diving equipment or dive gear along with any other equipment necessary for the dive.|$|R

5000|$|In 1860, Rouquayrol became {{concerned}} with mine safety {{problems related to}} firedamp (flammable natural gases in coal mines). He created a rescue apparatus consisting of a pressurized gas chamber coupled to a pressure regulator that he called the [...] "Regulator for Equalization of Compressed Gas." [...] In 1864, {{with the help of}} the French Navy lieutenant Auguste Denayrouze (also of Aveyron), Rouquayrol created the first <b>diving</b> <b>suit.</b> This <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> won the gold medal at the 1867 World's Fair, and drew the attention of author Jules Verne. Verne included the <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> in his fictional depiction of a contemporary submarine voyage, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.|$|R

25|$|The first <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> designs {{appeared}} in the early 18th century. Two English inventors developed the first pressure-proof <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> in the 1710s. John Lethbridge built a completely enclosed suit to aid in salvage work. It consisted of a pressure-proof air-filled barrel with a glass viewing hole and two watertight enclosed sleeves. This suit gave the diver more maneouverability to accomplish useful underwater salvage work.|$|R
50|$|The first {{environmental}} <b>suits</b> were <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> {{designed to}} protect a diver from the surrounding water (see timeline of underwater technology). Later developments were {{designed to protect}} the wearer from the cold (for example wetsuits and other ambient pressure suits) or from undersea high pressure and the resulting decompression sickness (for example atmospheric <b>diving</b> <b>suits).</b> Protecting the wearer from cold is also a feature of ski suits.|$|R
