5|$|Prediction of the {{probable}} chemical properties of meitnerium {{has not received}} much attention recently. Meitnerium {{is expected to be}} a noble metal. Based on the <b>most</b> <b>stable</b> oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements, the <b>most</b> <b>stable</b> oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the +6, +3, and +1 states, with the +3 state being the <b>most</b> <b>stable</b> in aqueous solutions. In comparison, rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of +6, while the <b>most</b> <b>stable</b> states are +4 and +3 for iridium and +3 for rhodium. The oxidation state +9, represented only by iridium in +, might be possible for its congener meitnerium in the nonafluoride (MtF9) and the + cation, although + is expected to be more stable than these meitnerium compounds. The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium, thus also allowing a stable +4 state. It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium (element 107) to darmstadtium (element 110) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution.|$|E
