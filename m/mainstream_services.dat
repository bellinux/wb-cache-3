40|$|ABSTRACT: Within {{the nursing}} {{profession}} stress and burnout {{are considered to}} be widely present and problematic. These factors tend to impact negatively on job satisfaction and ultimately affect the retention of nurses. Psychiatric/mental health nursing as a specialty {{is considered to be a}} highly stressful environment; however, there is a paucity of research in this area. The current study adopted a survey design to compare forensic psychiatric nurses (n = 51) with psychiatric nurses from a <b>mainstreamed</b> mental health <b>service</b> (n = 78) in relation to burnout and job satisfaction. Forensic nurses displayed lower burnout and higher job satisfaction than their counterparts from the <b>mainstreamed</b> <b>services.</b> These findings are surprising in light of the image of forensic psychiatric nursing as dangerous and unpredictable...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} about finding out if Aboriginal men in Darwin {{perceive}} racism {{when they are}} using <b>mainstream</b> health <b>services</b> and if so, ascertaining if these perceptions affect their utilisation of <b>mainstream</b> health <b>services.</b> The main aim {{of the study was}} to generate literature that does not appear in existing literature. Although some of the existing literature does show that Aboriginal people do experience racism in mainstream health care, the literature does not reveal much detail. The intention of this study was to fill this gap in the literature through perspectives of Aboriginal men and through the researcher’s daily observations of Aboriginal men using a <b>mainstream</b> health <b>service.</b> To gain this perspective the researcher wanted to be at a <b>mainstream</b> health <b>service</b> to see first-hand what participants discussed. To do this an ethnographic approach was used. The ethnographic component of the study was conducted in conjunction with semi-structured interviews with Aboriginal men and an extensive literature review. The outcomes of this were that Aboriginal men do perceive racism in <b>mainstream</b> health <b>services</b> and these perceptions affect the way they utilise mainstream health care providers. These affects impact on Aboriginal men’s decision to use the health service, influences how long they are at the health service and when they leave, and also influences how they behave and interact with staff at the health service. The researcher believes this study and the outcomes it has produced will provide people involved in health care delivery in the Darwin area and involved in health research in the Darwin area with a valuable yet concealed insight into health care for Aboriginal men...|$|R

This is a group that often has multiple problems for which they need the input {{of a wide range of}} agencies, including housing, drugs, mental health, and benefits. The mental health problems of the group are usually a core or exacerbating factor. Routinely, they fall through the gaps of existing mental health service provision, as their mental health problems are not considered sufficiently [...] "severe" [...] to warrant care from statutory services; but they are frequently excluded from <b>mainstream</b> <b>services</b> in the community, such as GPs and Housing Associations, on account of the perceived complexity of their needs and their often challenging behaviour. Consequently, the lack of support contributes to a downward spiral that brings people into contact with the criminal justice system. It is estimated that the number of individuals within the {{revolving door}} group is approximately 60,000 at any one time.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explored how the cultural context of intimate partner violence affected accessibility to <b>mainstream</b> <b>services</b> for one immigrant group: Haitian women.

Second, <b>mainstream</b> <b>services</b> are largely inaccessible to Haitian women. The authors conclude with suggestions for overcoming cultural barriers through educa-tion, increasing cultural competency of <b>mainstream</b> <b>services,</b> and creating alternative community-based services...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuum}} of care framework posits that individuals {{move from one}} level to the next in seeking resources for help ranging from first using informal support to finally using formal services. Yet, the literature is mostly focused on formal services. It is well-known in the literature that existing formal services are underutilized by the Asian American population. If that {{is also the case}} in nontraditional settlement cities like Richmond, Virginia, the {{continuum of}} care framework and existing literature suggest that Asian Americans are turning to their informal support networks to meet their needs. Thus far, the literature on informal support networks is very limited and a focus on Asian American communities is nonexistent. Furthermore, there is not an adequate theory to explain and predict this phenomenon. This study uses a grounded theory design to develop a testable theory that could further the understanding of informal support networks in the Asian American community. The theory posits that the Asian culture and community influence how individuals within the community seek help in times of need and, in turn, the helping process developed within the informal support network is a reinforcement of the Asian culture and community. When individuals have needs, they look to the informal support network and the network is developed in response to those needs. However, the informal support network is not able to meet all the needs of the Asian American community. At times, though infrequent, when the informal support network cannot meet the need, individuals are referred to <b>mainstream</b> <b>services.</b> Therefore, the informal support network serves as a gatekeeper to <b>mainstream</b> <b>services.</b> In addition, needs are rarely successfully met directly by <b>mainstream</b> <b>services</b> because of inaccessibility. Consequently, <b>mainstream</b> <b>services</b> provide infrequent help in meeting the needs of the Asian American community. It is important to comprehend how these developing communities in the new South are responding to their own needs. This understanding will allow <b>mainstream</b> <b>services</b> to extend formal systems of care and better partner with existing resources to effectively serve the increasing Asian American population in the South...|$|E
