25|$|Daniels {{answers the}} call leaving ASA Rhonda Pearlman alone to field {{questions}} from Deputy Commissioner William Rawls and Commissioner Ervin Burrell. She reports that forensics teams are attending each crime scene {{and they are}} recovering 9mm bullet casings, vacuuming for hair and fiber and laser printing for footprints. Daniels returns and is asked {{to confirm that the}} bodies are linked to one organization. He tells Burrell that Marlo Stanfield's drug organization is their prime focus and is then asked what they have on Stanfield. He explains that Major Crimes was building a case against Stanfield until three <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> their wiretaps were pulled by Lieutenant Marimow. Burrell offers Daniels whatever support he needs. Daniels tells Burrell that he needs the patrol division to begin searching for houses. Daniels leaves to begin organizing a citywide search.|$|E
2500|$|... A {{few weeks}} later, our dog {{got hit by}} a {{snowplow}} and I forgot all about the problem of names. Until college, when I learned to play the guitar, and, as an exercise, started writing songs (very poorly executed) {{in the same way that}} Henry Ford produced the automobile: assembly-line-style. I wrote songs for the days of the week (poor Monday!). Songs for the planets (poor Pluto!). Songs for the Apostles (poor Judas!). And, finally, when all else failed, I started a series of songs for names. [...] Each piece was a rhetorical, philosophical, musical rumination on all the possible names I had entertained years before when my parents had given me the one chance to change my own. Oh fates! I sang these songs in the privacy of my dorm room, behind closed doors, pillows and cushions stuffed in the air vents so no one would hear. And then I almost failed Latin class, my grades plummeted, my social life dissolved into ping pong tournaments in the residence halls, and, gradually, my interest in music (or anything divine, creative, fruitful, enriching) completely waned. I turned to beer. And cigarettes. And TV sitcoms. And candy bars. Oh well! A perfectly good youth wasted on junk food! That is, until a few <b>months</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> I came across some of the old name songs, stuffed onto tape cassettes, 4-track recorders, forgotten boxes, forgotten shelves, forgotten hard drives. It was like finding an old diary, or a high school yearbook, senior picture with lens flare and pockmarks, slightly cute and embarrassing. What was I thinking? [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|On 10 December, {{thirteen}} Egyptian {{and international}} human rights organizations urged Cairo's interim authorities to probe the mass killing of protesters in the capital on 14 August. The joint call issued by organizations that included Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said an investigation must be launched into the killing of [...] "up to 1,000 people by security forces" [...] almost four <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> they dispersed sit-ins by supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi. [...] "There can be no hope {{for the rule of}} law and political stability in Egypt, much less some modicum of justice for victims, without accountability for what may be the single biggest incident of mass killing in Egypt's recent history," [...] said Gasser Abdel-Razak, associate director at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. [...] "As a first step toward accountability, the government should establish an effective independent fact-finding committee to investigate responsibility throughout the chain of command for the unlawful killings," [...] the rights groups said. They said that on 14 August a [...] "small minority of protesters used firearms... but the police responded excessively by shooting recklessly, going far beyond what is permitted under international law." [...] "After the unprecedented levels of violence and casualties seen since the ousting of Mohamed Morsi, investigations must provide real answers and cannot be another whitewash of the security forces' record," [...] Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui of Amnesty International said in the statement. [...] "Egypt's authorities cannot deal with the carnage through PR in world's capitals, rewriting events and locking up Morsi's supporters." [...] The groups also said the probe should determine whether there is any evidence of a policy to kill protesters or commit other serious crimes.|$|E
