25|$|A recent reevaluation of cranial traits {{suggests}} that the Ainu resemble the Okhotsk <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> the Jōmon. This agrees with the reference to the Ainu being a merger of Okhotsk and Satsumon referenced above. A recent genetic study has revealed that the Ainu's closest human relatives are the Ryukyuan people, Yamato people, Taiwanese people and Nivkh.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Shore is less populous {{and more}} rural, {{as are the}} {{counties}} of western Maryland. The two westernmost counties of Maryland, Allegany and Garrett, are mountainous and sparsely populated, resembling West Virginia and Appalachia <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> the rest of Maryland. Both eastern and western Maryland are, however, dotted with cities of regional importance, such as Ocean City, Princess Anne, and Salisbury on the Eastern Shore and Cumberland, Frostburg, and Hancock in Western Maryland.|$|E
500|$|The main {{themes of}} Catching Fire include survival, sacrifice, and the {{conflict}} between interdependence and independence. As reviewer Margo Dill noted, [...] "In , Katniss and Peeta are definitely interdependent. They are both helping each other to survive. As a matter of fact, they want the other one to survive <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> themselves." [...] Dill goes on to explain how this likely increases the chances of each character dying.|$|E
60|$|The Presbyterians {{hated the}} Independents much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> the bishops, which induced them to {{cooperate}} in effecting the Restoration.|$|R

50|$|Part 5: Women of Afghanistan debunks {{the claim}} that American troops support a feminist revolution. In this chapter, Afghan women report that <b>they</b> are {{suffering}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> under the Taliban.|$|R
500|$|Like {{many other}} U2 songs, [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] can be {{interpreted}} in a religious manner. Author Cameron Conant related the opening verse to the doubt he felt about his convictions on politics, marriage, and faith as he aged, concluding that a person's confidence in their beliefs makes {{it seem as if}} they know <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> Music critic Bill Friskics-Warren felt that the final line, [...] "Blessings not just for the ones who kneel, luckily", was a way for Bono to berate himself for not praying enough, and was an attack on Christianity because [...] "faith often perpetuates the misery and divisiveness that he decries." [...] Steve Stockman, a chaplain at Queen's University of Belfast, believed the song was a metaphor for growing up, and that the final line meant that not just people of faith could be blessed.|$|E
500|$|The gradual {{alteration}} of Rick was frequently {{mentioned in the}} critiques. Dan Hopper of Best Week Ever theorized that such a drastic transition was attributed {{by the death of}} his friend Shane. Halden proclaimed that the progression established a strong sense of direction for the character. [...] "This is a definite direction. I’m not sure if the show’s going to make Rick an out-and-out monster, or if this is setting up some sort of redemptive arc for him in season three, but it’s a strong choice. The Walking Dead has tried to make us value this group of people, as if together, they mean <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> alone. That hasn’t worked, so now it appears we’re going to try trial by fire." [...] By the end of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] Ryan concluded that [...] "Rick is becoming the leader he should have been from the start, and he's being clear and upfront about his goals and leadership style." ...|$|E
500|$|Dissenters such as Priestley who {{supported}} the French Revolution came under increasing suspicion as scepticism regarding the revolution grew. In its propaganda against [...] "radicals", Pitt's administration used the [...] "gunpowder" [...] statement to argue that Priestley and other Dissenters wanted to overthrow the government. Burke, in his famous Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), tied natural philosophers, and specifically Priestley, to the French Revolution, writing that radicals {{who supported}} science in Britain [...] "considered man in their experiments no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> mice in an air pump". Burke also associated republican principles with alchemy and insubstantial air, mocking the scientific work done by both Priestley and French chemists. He made much in his later writings of the connections between [...] "Gunpowder Joe", science, and Lavoisier—who was improving gunpowder for the French in their war against Britain. Paradoxically, a secular statesman, Burke, argued against science and maintained that religion should {{be the basis of}} civil society, whereas a Dissenting minister, Priestley, argued that religion could not provide the basis for civil society and should be restricted to one's private life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bother! how {{is one to}} remember! It's all {{nonsense}} {{making such}} a fuss. The children fancied they put in ever so much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> and very likely took out some." ...|$|R
50|$|But {{few people}} took {{any of those}} claims seriously any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> the claim that Kambona himself was not a Tanzanian citizen but a Malawian, from Likoma Island, or a Mozambican.|$|R

2500|$|In {{subsequent}} scenes, Charlotte displays {{an ability}} to {{change the nature of}} some fiends into helpful friends, further frustrating Vendetta's efforts to undo her. Being [...] "oblivious to all that is bad and mean in the world", Charlotte neither acknowledges the damage caused by Vendetta's fiends, nor the threat Vendetta herself poses over Clamburg. Nearly all of the residents, including Vendetta's parents, come to hate or fear Charlotte <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> Vendetta within the first six episodes.|$|E
2500|$|Both the fat {{globules}} and {{the smaller}} casein micelles, which are just large enough to deflect light, contribute to the opaque white color of milk. The fat globules contain some yellow-orange carotene, enough in some breeds (such as Guernsey and Jersey cattle) to impart a golden or [...] "creamy" [...] hue to a glass of milk. The riboflavin in the whey portion of milk has a greenish color, which sometimes can be discerned in skimmed milk or whey products. Fat-free skimmed milk has only the casein micelles to scatter light, {{and they tend to}} scatter shorter-wavelength blue light <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> red, giving skimmed milk a bluish tint.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conventional}} song {{system of}} songbirds has two parts: the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) involved in song learning, and the posterior forebrain pathway or [...] "song motor pathway" [...] (PFP/SMP) involved in song production. Both of these descending pathways contain neurons that are responsive to conspecific song. Female Canaries {{lost the ability}} to discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific song after bilateral lesions to the high vocal center HVC, a nucleus that sits at the apex of both pathways. In males, however, most song system neurons respond maximally {{to the sound of the}} bird's own song, even <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> to the tutor's song or any other conspecific song. In HVC, neurons switch from responding best to tutor song (35–69 days post-hatch) to responding best to the bird's own song (>70 days post-hatch). Song preferences of neurons in these pathways are important for sensorimotor learning, however several lines of evidence suggest that the specific ability to discriminate conspecific from heterospecific song does not reside in the AFP or the SMP. Most importantly, gene expression studies have demonstrated that, as a broad unit, neurons in the AFP and SMP show increased activation when a bird is singing, but not when it is simply listening to song. With the exception of female Canaries, the neural substrate for conspecific song preference is thought to reside outside the conventional song system, in the auditory pathway.|$|E
5000|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated [...] "Perhaps they're {{playing by}} the rules <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> on Lines, but that's a good thing: they're letting {{themselves}} act like kids, not adults, winding up with a clutch of lively, effervescent pop." ...|$|R

50|$|The next day, {{the adults}} have {{returned}} to their senses.

6000|$|Carrie smiled absently, though {{something}} in his attitude caused her a slight uneasiness. [...] "Looking at Mrs. Custer's turkeys, I believe," [...] she said.

5000|$|Years later, one non-Mormon {{neighbor}} {{summed up}} views of Smith {{and his family}} by their Palmyra neighbors by saying, [...] "To tell the truth, {{there was something about}} him they could not understand; some way he knew <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> and it made them mad." ...|$|R

60|$|September 3d.--We {{walked into}} Florence yesterday, betimes after breakfast, it being comfortably cool, and a gray, English sky; though, indeed, the clouds had a {{tendency}} to mass themselves <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> on an overcast English day. We found it warmer in Florence, but, not inconveniently so, even in the sunniest streets and squares.|$|E
60|$|Bugs and beetles did not scare her any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> the boys.

60|$|The {{one voice}} {{she could not}} hear was Peregrine's, perhaps because he {{realised}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> that she was within ear-shot, and besides, he was absolutely sober; but she thought he silenced them; and then she heard sounds of card-playing, which made an accompaniment to her agonised prayers.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} the boys had {{replaced}} his carts as they had found them, {{he came out of}} his sorrow sufficiently to invite them to remain to dinner, and he urged the invitation so strongly that they concluded to accept it, especially since the horses, more particularly George's, needed dinner even <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Now the {{supposition}} {{that the}} two Propositions, [...] "Some x are y" [...] and [...] "No x are not-y", do not [...] "assert", necessarily involves the supposition that [...] "All x are y" [...] does not [...] "assert", since it would be absurd to suppose that they assert, when combined, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> when taken separately.|$|E
60|$|I deeply {{regret the}} anti-American {{articles}} {{of some of}} the leading reviews. The Americans regard what is said of them in England a thousand times <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> any thing said of them in any other country. The Americans are excessively pleased with any kind or favourable expressions, and never forgive or forget any slight or abuse. It would be better for them if they were a trifle thicker-skinned.|$|E
60|$|There {{are other}} kinds of courser Sands, which are browner, and have their {{particles}} much bigger; these, view'd with a Microscope, seem much courser and more opacous substances, {{and most of them}} are of some irregularly rounded Figures; and though they seem not so opacous as to the naked eye, yet they seem very foul and cloudy, but neither do these want curiously transparent, no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> regularly figur'd and well colour'd particles, as I have often found.|$|E
50|$|The German {{government}} {{used the}} attacks {{as a form}} of propaganda almost instantaneously, the names and kinds of injuries, especially those affecting children.
