Methods: Eleven Brazilian patients with <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>II</b> were prospectively studied at the Division of Medical Genetics of Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre. The initial assessment and the assessment at 12 months included: anamnesis, physical examination, abdominal nuclear magnetic resonance, echocardiogram, 6 -minute walk test, audiometry, serum biochemical tests and urinary glycosaminoglycan concentration. Results: The major findings after comparing the assessments were: 1) two patients had growth retardation; 2) two patients showed negative weight change; 3) one patient went from obese to overweight; 4) three patients revealed left ventricle hypertrophy; of these, two {{increased the number of}} cardiac valve lesions; 5) there was no statistically significant difference between the mean distances obtained on the 6 -minute walk test; 6) there was splenic enlargement; 7) there was an increase in gamma-glutamyltransferase levels; 8) the urinary concentration of glycosaminoglycans remained unchanged.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{for the treatment of}} many central nervous system (CNS) disorders is the lack of convenient and effective methods for delivering biological agents to the brain. <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>II</b> (Hunter syndrome) is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder resulting from a deficiency of iduronate- 2 -sulfatase (I 2 S). I 2 S is a large, highly glycosylated enzyme. Intravenous administration {{is not likely to be}} an effective therapy for disease-related neurological outcomes that require enzyme access to the brain cells, in particular neurons and oligodendrocytes. We demonstrate that intracerebroventricular and lumbar intrathecal administration of recombinant I 2 S in dogs and nonhuman primates resulted in widespread enzyme distribution in the brain parenchyma, including remarkable deposition in the lysosomes of both neurons and oligodendrocytes. Lumbar intrathecal administration also resulted in enzyme delivery to the spinal cord, whereas little enzyme was detected there after intraventricular administration. <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>II</b> model is available in mice. Lumbar administration of recombinant I 2 S to enzyme deficient animals reduced the storage of glycosaminoglycans in both superficial and deep brain tissues, with concurrent morphological improvements.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> type <b>II</b> (Hunter's syndrome) is an X-linked {{chromosomal}} storage disorder due to {{deficiency of}} the lysosomal enzyme iduronate- 2 -sulfatase with patients rarely living till adulthood. Failure to identify patients early {{could contribute to}} an increased morbidity as identified in this case report. CASE DETAILS: An eight year old patient with Hunter's syndrome identified five years after disease onset with severe cardiovascular complications exemplifies the challenges faced in resource-limited countries towards making {{diagnosis and treatment of}} rare conditions. Elevated urinary glycosaminoglycans levels or a strong clinical suspicion of Hunter's syndrome, as identified in the index case, is a prerequisite for enzyme activity testing. Urinary mucopolysaccharide(MPS) level was 69. 6 mg/mmol(normal range is 0. 0 - 11. 6 mg/mmol), and the confirming MPS electrophoresis analysis showed elevated heparan sulphate in the urine sample. Enzyme activity testing, with absent or very low iduronate- 2 -sulfatase activity, is diagnostic. However, the scarce availability and high cost of these tests is another constraint in making a diagnosis.

40|$|Most {{lysosomal}} diseases (LD) are inherited as {{autosomal recessive}} traits, but two important conditions have X-linked inheritance: Fabry disease and <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>II</b> (MPS II). These two diseases show {{a very different}} pattern regarding expression on heterozygotes, which {{does not seem to}} be explained by the X-inactivation mechanism only. While MPS II heterozygotes are asymptomatic in most instances, in Fabry disease most of female carriers show some disease manifestation, which is sometimes severe. It is known that there is a major difference among X-linked diseases depending on the cell autonomy of the gene product involved and, therefore, on the occurrence of cross-correction. Since lysosomal enzymes are usually secreted and uptaken by neighbor cells, the different findings between MPS II and Fabry disease heterozygotes can also be due to different efficiency of crosscorrection (higher in MPS II and lower in Fabry disease). In this paper, we review these two X-linked LD in order to discuss the mechanisms that could explain the different rates of penetrance and expressivity observed in the heterozygotes; this could be helpful to better understand the expression of X-linked traits...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this article, {{we review}} {{specific}} therapies that tackle the basic biochemical defects of lysosomal storage diseases. These include bone marrow transplantation, substrate deprivation therapy, enzyme replacement therapy and enzyme enhancement therapy. We particularly update {{the progress of}} development of enzyme replacement therapy, which {{plays a major role}} in the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases. Nowadays, enzyme products have been developed and marketed for treatment of Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, mucopolysaccharidosis I and currently there are ongoing trials of enzyme replacement for the treatment of glycogen storage disease II, <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>II</b> and VI and Niemann-Pick B disease. Enzyme replacement therapy has a definite role in treatment of lysosomal storage diseases as it can ameliorate the signs and symptoms of the diseases. However, there are certain limitations. Enzyme replacement therapy is ineffective in improving or preventing neurological involvement. Response to treatment is slow in some situations, for example, bone involvement in Gaucher disease. It may also be unpredictable in other situations, for example, lung involvement in Gaucher disease. Hence, there is room for incorporation of other treatment modalities.

Affected patients suffer progressive damage to multiple organ systems and early mortality. Two thirds of patients also manifest cognitive impairment and developmental delays. MPS II can be extremely difficult to diagnose before irreversible organ and tissue damage has occurred because of an insidious onset and the overlap in signs and symptoms with common childhood complaints. This is particularly true of patients without cognitive impairment (attenuated phenotype).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesFor rare {{diseases}} {{it may be}} difficult to generate data from randomized trials to support funding of a drug. Enzyme replacement therapies for diseases of inherited metabolic enzyme deficiency provide an example of this dilemma. The Ontario Public Drug Programs convened the Drugs for Rare Diseases Working Group to develop a policy for assessing these drugs. MethodsThe Drugs for Rare Diseases Working Group developed terms of reference expecting that the ideal policy product would be transparent and consistent and address unique aspects of the treatment of a specific rare condition while being adaptable to other dissimilar conditions. The perspective was that of a public payer addressing requests for funding generated for a specific drug, and included respect for the principles of “accountability for reasonableness” of Daniels and Sabin. ResultsA seven-step framework was developed and tested by using the case study of idursulfase for <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>II</b> (Hunter disease). Estimation of clinical effectiveness was done by using decision modeling. The model developed informed funding recommendations and ultimately led to an agreement with the manufacturer allowing funding of idursulfase in Ontario.
