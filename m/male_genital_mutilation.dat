5000|$|Young {{women also}} undergo {{excision}} ("female circumcision", [...] "female genital mutilation," [...] "emorata") {{as part of}} an elaborate rite of passage ritual called [...] "Emuratare," [...] the ceremony that initiates young Maasai girls into adulthood through ritual circumcision and then into early arranged marriages. [...] The Maasai believe that female circumcision is necessary and Maasai men may reject any woman who has not undergone it as either not marriageable or worthy of a much-reduced bride price. In Eastern Africa, uncircumcised women, even those highly educated members of parliament like Linah Kilimo, can be accused of not being mature enough to be taken seriously. To others the practice of female circumcision is known as female genital mutilation, and draws a great deal of criticism from both abroad and many women who have undergone it, such as Maasai activist Agnes Pareiyo. It has recently been replaced in some instances by a [...] "cutting with words" [...] ceremony involving singing and dancing in place of the mutilation. However, the practice remains deeply ingrained and valued by the culture. The Maa word for circumcision, [...] "emorata," [...] is used for both female and <b>male</b> <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation.</b> Female genital cutting is illegal in both Kenya and Tanzania. These circumcisions are usually performed by an invited 'practitioner' who is often not Maasai, usually from a Dorobo group. The knives and blades which make the cut are fashioned by blacksmiths, il-kunono, who make their weapons for the Maasai do not make their own:(knives, short swords (ol alem or simi or seme), spears, etc.). Similar to the young men, women who will be circumcised wear dark clothing, paint their faces with markings, and then cover their faces on completion of the ceremony.|$|E
40|$|<b>Male</b> <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> is {{a common}} {{mechanism}} by which males reduce sperm competition by plugging female insemination ducts with different parts of its own genital system. This behavior is frequent in many spider families but is uncommon in Haplogynae. The reproductive biology of Dysderoidea is not well studied and the data is fragmentary; <b>male</b> <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> has been reported only for one species of Oonopidae. This study provides evidence of <b>male</b> <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> in Unicorn catleyi Platnick and Brescovit (Araneae: Oonopidae).

This behavior is a strategy used by the males in order to guarantee their paternity and not for escape from female attacks as has been reported for other species of Araneae, since cannibalism is unlikely in this species. The presence of embolus in the posterior receptaculum suggests this is the first place where sperm is received. The similarity of the female genitalia of U. catleyi to those of Orsolobidae, along with sclerotization of the seminal duct in the male copulatory bulb that is also present in Orchestina, Xiombarg, and Orsolobidae, provide strong evidence of the basal position of this genus in the family Oonopidae...|$|E

2500|$|Sexual {{cannibalism}} has impaired {{the ability}} of the orb-weaving spider, N. fenestrata, to perform mate guarding. If a male successfully mates with a female, he then exhibits mate guarding, inhibiting the female from re-mating, thus ensuring his paternity and eliminating sperm competition. Guarding can refer to the blockage of female genital openings to prevent further insertion of a competing male pedipalps, or physical guarding from potential mates. Guarding can decrease female re-mating by fifty percent. [...] <b>Males</b> who experience <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> can sometimes exhibit the [...] "gloves off" [...] hypothesis which states that a male's body weight and his endurance are inversely proportional. Thus when a male's body weight decreases substantially, his endurance increases as a result, allowing him to guard his female mate with increased efficiency.|$|R
2500|$|Before {{or after}} copulating with females, certain males of spider {{species in the}} {{superfamily}} Araneoidea become half or full eunuchs with {{one or both of}} their pedipalps (<b>male</b> <b>genitals)</b> severed. [...] This behavior is often seen in sexually cannibalistic spiders, causing them to exhibit the [...] "eunuch phenomenon". [...] Due to the chance that they may be eaten during or after copulation, <b>male</b> spiders use <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> to increase their chances of successful mating. The male can increase his chances of paternity if the female's copulatory organs are blocked, which decreases sperm competition and her chances of mating with other males. In one study, females with mating plugs had a 75% less chance of re-mating. [...] Additionally, if a male successfully severs his pedipalp within the female copulatory duct the pedipalp can not only serve as a plug but can continue to release sperm to the female spermathacae, again increasing the male's chances of paternity. This is referred to as [...] "remote copulation". Occasionally (in 12% of cases in a 2012 study on Nephilidae spiders) palp severance is only partial due to copulation interruption by sexual cannibalism. Partial palp severance can result in a successful mating plug but not to the extent of full palp severance.|$|R
40|$|Monogyny (male monogamy) {{is found}} in a diverse {{assemblage}} of taxa, and recent theoretical work reveals that a male-biased sex ratio can favour the evolution of this relatively rare mating system. We integrate this theoretical framework with field observations and laboratory experiments involving the sexually size dimorphic fishing spider, Dolomedes tenebrosus, to test the prediction that this species exhibits monogyny. Field surveys revealed a male-biased sex ratio, likely resulting from different life-history strategies (early male maturation). Results from mating trials supported our prediction of monogyny as we discovered that males mate with a single female. Unexpectedly, however, we observed that mating results in obligate <b>male</b> death and <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation.</b> Additional field observations of released individuals suggest that males are not limited by their ability to encounter additional females. Controlled laboratory assays demonstrated that males discriminate among virgin and non-virgin female silk cues, consistent with predictions of first-male sperm precedence. In summary, we report a novel case of male self-sacrifice in a species that exhibits female-biased sexual size dimorphism, male-biased sex ratio, <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> and a suggestion of first-male sperm precedence; {{all of which are}} consistent with theoretical predictions of the evolution of monogyny.

40|$|Asexuality has major {{theoretical}} {{advantages over}} sexual reproduction. Why, then, do exclusively asexual metazoan lineages rarely endure? The Red Queen hypothesis posits that asexuals are extinguished by relentlessly co-evolving parasites and pathogens. If so, any long-lasting asexual lineage must have unusual alternative mechanisms {{to deal with}} these biological enemies. In theory, asexual host organisms could persist by dispersing rapidly among habitat patches independently of parasites. Might this scenario apply to bdelloid rotifers, a class of tiny freshwater invertebrates that abandoned sex millions of years ago? Bdelloids thrive in ephemerally moist microhabitats, withstanding periods of desiccation by contracting into tiny anhydrobiotic propagules that are carried on the wind to colonize new patches. Chapters One and Two demonstrate that lab-cultured populations of three bdelloid species can rid themselves of five deadly fungal parasites during desiccation, especially when dried and allowed to disperse in an artificial wind chamber. Chapter Three shows that natural populations of bdelloids colonize elevated habitat patches more rapidly than other microfauna, and that these wind-founded populations have significantly lower parasite incidences than control populations at ground-level. Results support the hypothesis that desiccation-tolerance and wind dispersal decouple bdelloids from coevolving enemies in space and time, allowing these asexuals to "outrun" the Red Queen. Consequences of sex include conflicts over paternity. In Chapter Four, I argue that sexual conflict underpins a puzzling human cultural phenomenon. A quarter of preindustrial societies practice some form of <b>male</b> <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> (MGM), despite its clear costs. Substantially altering the naturally selected genital morphology is likely to reduce a man's capacity to compete with other males for fertilizations, especially outside the pair-bond. MGM could therefore reduce the ability of young men to challenge the paternity of older, married men. In societies where paternity uncertainty and reproductive conflict are high, elders may be favored to enforce MGM via sanctions and incentives. As predicted by this sexual conflict hypothesis, MGM rituals are highly public, watched mainly by men, and facilitate access to social and material benefits. MGM is more common in polygynous societies, particularly when co-wives reside separately; it is also associated with lower-than-expected incidences of extramarital sex...|$|E

40|$|Is {{the legal}} {{protection}} that {{is given to}} the expression of Abrahamic religious belief adequate or appropriate in the context of English medical law? This is the central question that is explored in the thesis. A framework to support judges in the resolution of contentious cases that involve dissension between religious belief and medical law is developed from Alan Gewirth’s Principle of Generic Consistency (PGC). This framework is applied to a number of medical law cases studies: the principle of double effect, ritual <b>male</b> circumcision, female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation,</b> Jehovah’s Witnesses (adults and children) who refuse blood transfusions, and conscientious objection of healthcare professionals to abortion. The thesis also examines the legal and religious contexts in which these contentious cases are arbitrated. It demonstrates how human rights law and the proposed framework can provide a gauge to measure competing rights and apply legitimate limits to the expression of religious belief, where appropriate. Thus, the original and significant contribution to knowledge is the development of an evaluative framework and its application to distinct case studies. This leads to the conclusion, based upon a stance of principled pragmatism, that some aspects of current legal protections in English medical law require amendment...|$|R
