5|$|An MR venogram is also {{performed}} {{in most cases}} to exclude the possibility of venous sinus stenosis/obstruction or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A contrast-enhanced MRV (ATECO) scan has a high detection rate for abnormal transverse sinus stenoses. These stenoses can be more adequately identified and assessed with catheter cerebral venography and <b>manometry.</b> Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal <b>manometry</b> and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis. Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome. The primary symptom, the regurgitation of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least sixweeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation must begin within 30minutes of {{the completion of a}} meal. Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90minutes, or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of a hiatus hernia is typically made through an upper GI series, endoscopy or high resolution <b>manometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{external}} rectal prolapse, internal rectal intussusception is {{not visible}} externally, {{but it may}} still be diagnosed by digital rectal examination, while the patient strains as if to defecate. Imaging such as a defecating proctogram or dynamic MRI defecography can demonstrate the abnormal folding of the rectal wall. Some have advocated the use of anorectal physiology testing (anorectal <b>manometry).</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{investigations}} {{may include}} esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Barium swallow X-rays {{should not be}} used for diagnosis. Esophageal <b>manometry</b> is not recommended for use in diagnosis, being recommended only prior to surgery. Ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring may be useful in those who do not improve after PPIs and is not needed in those in whom Barrett's esophagus is seen. Investigation for H. pylori is not usually needed.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors include}} obesity, pregnancy, smoking, hiatus hernia, and taking certain medicines. Medications {{involved}} include antihistamines, calcium channel blockers, antidepressants, and sleeping medication. It {{is due to}} poor closure of the lower esophageal sphincter (the junction between the stomach and the esophagus). Diagnosis among {{those who do not}} improve with simpler measures may involve gastroscopy, upper GI series, esophageal pH monitoring, or esophageal <b>manometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{achieved}} mainly by plain and contrasted radiographical and ultrasound imaging. Colonic marker transit studies are useful to distinguish colonic inertia from functional outlet obstruction causes. In this test, the patient swallows a water-soluble bolus of radio-opaque contrast and films are obtained 1, 3 and 5 days later. Patients with colonic inertia show the marker {{spread throughout the}} large intestines, while patients with outlet obstruction exhibit slow accumulations of markers in some places. A colonoscopy {{can also be used}} to rule out mechanical obstructive causes. Anorectal <b>manometry</b> may help to differentiate acquired from congenital forms. Rectal biopsy is recommended to make a final diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.|$|E
25|$|Identification of {{the exact}} causes usually begins with a {{thorough}} medical history, including detailed questioning about symptoms, bowel habits, diet, medication and other medical problems. Digital rectal examination is performed to assesses resting pressure and voluntary contraction (maximum squeeze) of the sphincter complex and puborectalis. Anal sphincter defects, rectal prolapse, and abnormal perineal descent may be detected. Anorectal physiology tests assess {{the functioning of the}} anorectal anatomy. Anorectal <b>manometry</b> records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and during contraction. The procedure is also able to assess sensitivity of the anal canal and rectum. Anal electromyography tests for nerve damage, which is often associated with obstetric injury. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves. Proctography, also known as defecography, shows how much stool the rectum can hold, how well the rectum holds it, and how well the rectum can evacuate the stool. It will also highlight defects {{in the structure of the}} rectum such as internal rectal intussusception. Dynamic pelvic MRI, also called MRI defecography is an alternative which is better for some problems but not as good for other problems. Proctosigmoidoscopy involves the insertion of an endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera) into the anal canal, rectum and sigmoid colon. The procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut, and may detect signs of disease or other problems that could be a cause, such as inflammation, tumors, or scar tissue. Endoanal ultrasound, which some consider to be the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions, evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters, and may detect occult sphincter tears that otherwise would go unseen.|$|E
2500|$|Defecography, sigmoidoscopy, [...] transrectal ultrasound, mucosal biopsy, {{anorectal}} <b>manometry</b> and electromyography {{have all}} been used to diagnose and study SRUS. Some recommend biopsy as essential for diagnosis since ulcerations {{may not always be}} present, and others state defecography as the investigation of choice to diagnose SRUS.|$|E
2500|$|Nutcracker esophagus, or {{hypertensive}} peristalsis, is {{a disorder}} {{of the movement}} of the esophagus characterized by contractions in the smooth muscle of the esophagus in a normal sequence but at an excessive amplitude or duration. Nutcracker esophagus is one of several motility disorders of the esophagus, including achalasia and diffuse esophageal spasm. [...] It causes difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia, to both solid and liquid foods, and can cause significant chest pain; it may also be asymptomatic. [...] Nutcracker esophagus can affect people of any age, but is more common in the sixth and seventh decades of life. [...] The diagnosis is made by an esophageal motility study (esophageal <b>manometry),</b> which evaluates the pressure of the esophagus at various points along its length. [...] The term [...] "nutcracker esophagus" [...] comes from the finding of increased pressures during peristalsis, with a diagnosis made when pressures exceed 180 mmHg; this has been likened to the pressure of a mechanical nutcracker. [...] The disorder does not progress, and is not associated with any complications; as a result, treatment of nutcracker esophagus targets control of symptoms only.|$|E
2500|$|Nutcracker {{esophagus}} {{is characterized}} as a motility disorder of the esophagus, meaning that it is caused by abnormal movement, or peristalsis of the esophagus. Patients with motility disorders present with two key symptoms: either with chest pain (typically reported as non-cardiac chest pain as it is esophageal in origin), which is usually found in disorders of spasm, or with dysphagia (difficulty with swallowing). Nutcracker esophagus can present with either of these, but chest pain is the more common presentation. The chest pain is very severe and intense, and mimics cardiac chest pain. It may spread into the arm and back. The symptoms of nutcracker esophagus are intermittent, and may occur with or without food. [...] Rarely, patients can present with a sudden obstruction of the esophagus after eating food (termed a food bolus obstruction, or the 'steakhouse syndrome') requiring urgent treatment. The disorder does not progress to produce worsening symptoms or complications, unlike other motility disorders (such as achalasia) or anatomical abnormalities of the esophagus (such as peptic strictures or esophageal cancer). Many patients with nutcracker esophagus {{do not have any}} symptoms at all, as esophageal <b>manometry</b> studies done on patients without symptoms may show the same motility findings as nutcracker esophagus. Nutcracker esophagus may also be associated with the metabolic syndrome, The incidence of nutcracker esophagus in all patients is uncertain.|$|E
50|$|If {{achalasia}} suspected {{an upper}} endoscopy {{is required to}} exclude a malignancy {{as a cause of}} the findings on barium swallow. <b>Manometry</b> is performed next to confirm. A normal endoscopy should be followed by <b>manometry,</b> and if <b>manometry</b> is also normal, the diagnosis is functional dysphagia.|$|E
50|$|Recently, high {{resolution}} <b>manometry</b> (HRM) {{has been developed}} that significantly reduces the procedure time (10 minutes versus 45 minutes with conventional <b>manometry)</b> and provides enhanced patient comfort. Newer catheters incorporate concurrent impedance with HRM.|$|E

50|$|In April 2010, Given Imaging {{acquired}} Sierra Scientific Instruments, {{a leading}} provider of specialty GI diagnostic solutions and pioneer of high-resolution <b>manometry</b> for assessing gastrointestinal motility. The ManoScan 360 High-Resolution <b>Manometry</b> System has advanced diagnostic technology that captures all relevant esophageal motor function from the pharynx to the stomach {{with a single}} placement of the catheter. An average esophageal study can be completed in 10 minutes or less. The ManoScan 360 can be upgraded to incorporate an array of diagnostic modalities including <b>manometry</b> with impedance as well as anorectal and 3D HRM <b>Manometry.</b> Sierra Scientific also provides the AccuTrac pH and pH-Impedance Monitoring System, pH and pH-Z disposable catheters and ManoShield disposable catheter sheaths for both esophageal and anorectal catheters. Additionally, Sierra Scientific offers the Polygraf ID stationary gastrointestinal function testing platform and the Digitrapper(R) ambulatory pH monitoring system.|$|E
5000|$|High-resolution <b>manometry</b> (HRM) is a {{gastrointestinal}} motility {{diagnostic system}} that measures intraluminal pressure {{activity in the}} gastrointestinal tract using a series of closely spaced pressure sensors. For a <b>manometry</b> system to be classified as [...] "high-resolution" [...] as opposed to [...] "conventional", the pressure sensors need to be spaced at most 1 cm apart. Two dominant pressure transduction technologies are used: solid state pressure sensors and water perfused pressure sensors. Each pressure transduction technology has its own inherent advantages and disadvantages. HRM systems also require advanced computer hardware and software to store and analyze the <b>manometry</b> data.|$|E

5000|$|In 1883, Hugo Kronecker and Samuel James Meltzer studied {{oesophageal}} <b>manometry</b> in humans.|$|E
50|$|Because of its sensitivity, <b>manometry</b> (esophageal {{motility}} study) {{is considered}} the key test for establishing the diagnosis. A catheter (thin tube) is inserted through the nose, and the patient is instructed to swallow several times. The probe measures muscle contractions {{in different parts of}} the esophagus during the act of swallowing. <b>Manometry</b> reveals failure of the LES to relax with swallowing and lack of functional peristalsis in the smooth muscle esophagus.|$|E
5000|$|A RERA is {{characterized}} by increasing respiratory effort (and thus decreasing esophageal pressures) for 10 seconds or more leading to an arousal from sleep, but {{one that does not}} fulfill the criteria for a hypopnea or apnea.

50|$|Anorectal <b>manometry</b> is a {{technique}} used to measure contractility in the anus and rectum. This technique uses a balloon in the rectum to distend the rectum and a pressure sensor at the internal anal sphincter to measure {{the presence or absence}} of the rectosphincteric reflex.|$|E
50|$|Most of the time, the stapedius reflex {{is tested}} with tympanometry.

50|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} {{is made by}} suction biopsy of the distally narrowed segment. A histologic examination of the tissue would show a lack of ganglionic nerve cells.
