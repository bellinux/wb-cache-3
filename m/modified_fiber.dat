30|$|Between the {{modified}} fibers, EA-modified fiber showed higher exhaustion of dye {{than that of}} HEMA-modified fiber. As the grafting of HEMA was {{greater than that of}} EA, the availability of pores or cavities for dye penetration—and so dye absorption—was less for HEMA-modified fiber compared to that of EA <b>modified</b> <b>fiber.</b> Again, the crosslinking of HEMA and jute macroradicals consumed some of the primary hydroxyl groups of jute. This could have somehow reduced the interaction between the dye molecules and jute and ultimately reduced the dye absorption for HEMA <b>modified</b> <b>fiber.</b>|$|E

40|$|Sisal fibers {{have been}} {{chemically}} modified by reaction with lignins, extracted from sugarcane bagasse and Pinus-type wood and then hydroxymethylated, to increase adhesion in resol-type phenolic thermoset matrices. Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) {{results showed that}} acidic sites predominate for unmodified/modified sisal fibers and for phenolic thermoset, indicating that the phenolic matrix has properties that favor the interaction with sisal fibers. The IGC results also showed that the phenolic thermoset has a dispersive component closer {{to those of the}} <b>modified</b> <b>fibers</b> suggesting that thermoset interactions with the less polar <b>modified</b> <b>fibers</b> are favored. Surface SEM images of the <b>modified</b> <b>fibers</b> showed that the fiber bundle deaggregation increased after the treatment, making the interfibrillar structure less dense in comparison with that of unmodified fibers, which increased the contact area and encouraged microbial biodegradation in simulated soil. Water diffusion was observed to be faster for composites reinforced with <b>modified</b> <b>fibers,</b> since the phenolic resin penetrated better into <b>modified</b> <b>fibers,</b> thereby blocking water passage through their channels. Overall, composites` properties showed that <b>modified</b> <b>fibers</b> promote a significant reduction in the hydrophilic character, and consequently of the reinforced composite without a major effect on impact strength and with increased storage modulus.

30|$|The {{reactivity}} of lingocellulosic jute fiber to sunlight (UV) and atmospheric gases and chemicals was reduced by grafting jute with acrylate monomers, such as ethyl acrylate (EA) and 2 -hydroxy ethyl methacrylate (HEMA). The grafting reaction sufficiently blocked the reactive groups of jute and thus, physically- and chemically-bound cellulosic units {{and on the}} fiber surface. The grafting gave additional strength, higher thermal stability and improved surface smoothness. Though the <b>modified</b> <b>fibers</b> showed better color fastness properties in sunlight, the dyeability of the <b>modified</b> <b>fibers</b> somewhat decreased. Grafting reaction and other characteristics of <b>modified</b> <b>fibers</b> were investigated with FT-IR, tensile tester, thermogravimeric analyser, and grey scale respectively. The change of surface morphology of the jute fiber on modification was also observed with a scanning electron microscopy. Modification of bleached jute and alkali-activated bleached jute with HEMA gave higher graft yield (26.6, 29.4 %) than that of EA modification (22.5, 24.7 %). Due to the different chemical features, HEMA-modified fiber exhibited better chemical, thermal and physical properties.|$|R

At 900 °C and 100 mL min– 1 helium gas sweep rate, the oxygen fluxes for disk, conventional hollow <b>fiber,</b> <b>modified</b> hollow <b>fiber,</b> Ag-deposited <b>modified</b> hollow <b>fiber,</b> and Pt-deposited <b>modified</b> hollow <b>fiber</b> membranes are 0. 10, 0. 33, 0. 84, 1. 42, and 2. 62 mL min– 1 cm– 2, respectively, denoting enhanced performance in this sequential order. More than 300 % enhancement of fluxes is evidenced by modifying the geometry from disk to conventional hollow fiber. This is attributed to the thickness reduction from 1 mm to 0. 3 mm, thus implying bulk-diffusion and surface reaction as the jointly limiting transport step for this disk membrane. In contrast to a conventional hollow fiber that has a sandwich cross-sectional structure (e. g. dense center layer sandwiched by two finger-like layers) as well as dense outer and inner circumference surfaces, the <b>modified</b> hollow <b>fiber</b> has only one dense layer in its outer circumference surface with finger-like porous layer extending {{all the way from}} outer cross-sectional part to the inner cross-sectional part. This microstructural difference, in turn, provides substantial reduction of membrane thickness and enlarges surface reaction area for <b>modified</b> hollow <b>fiber</b> (relative to conventional hollow fiber), both of which contributes to the reduced bulk-diffusion and surface reaction resistance; evidenced by almost 250 % oxygen flux enhancement. To enhance the performance even further, catalyst (e. g., Ag or Pt) deposition on the outer circumference surface of <b>modified</b> hollow <b>fiber</b> can be utilized to reduce its dominating surface reaction resistance. While both catalysts increase the oxygen fluxes, Pt reveals itself as the better candidate relative to Ag due to melting-induced aggregation and growth of Ag at 950 °C. <br /...|$|R

Mutations located in the fiber knob AB and CD loops demonstrated the greatest reduction in fiber-mediated gene transfer in HeLa cells. We also observed effects on transduction efficiency with mutations in the FG loop, indicating that the binding site may extend to the adjacent monomer in the fiber trimer and in the HI loop.
