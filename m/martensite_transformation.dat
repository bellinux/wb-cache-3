5000|$|Point d {{at around}} 200 °C is the {{temperature}} needed {{to cool the}} steel to quench it. In modern theory it {{is known as the}} <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Many {{metals and}} {{non-metals}} exhibit a <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation</b> when cooled quickly(with external media like oil,polymer,water etc.). When a metal is cooled very quickly, the insoluble atoms {{may not be}} able to migrate out of the solution in time. This is called a [...] "diffusionless transformation." [...] When the crystal matrix changes to its low temperature arrangement, the atoms of the solute become trapped within the lattice. The trapped atoms prevent the crystal matrix from completely changing into its low temperature allotrope, creating shearing stresses within the lattice. When some alloys are cooled quickly, such as steel, the <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation</b> hardens the metal, while in others, like aluminum, the alloy becomes softer.|$|E
50|$|Quenching is {{a process}} of cooling a metal at a rapid rate. This is most often done to produce a <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation.</b> In ferrous alloys, this will often produce a harder metal, while {{non-ferrous}} alloys will usually become softer than normal.|$|E
30|$|The crystallographic {{orientation}} of initial austenite in Fe-based alloys is nonideally restored after reverse martensite transformation[3]. This {{is associated with}} the incomplete reversibility of direct and reverse <b>martensite</b> <b>transformations</b> and an accumulation of dislocations in the reverted austenite[4, 5]. Formation of structure defects on <b>martensite</b> <b>transformations</b> results in azimuthal tailing of diffraction reflections of single-crystalline samples. From the magnitude of tailing and from the increase of the misorientation angle of crystal lattice regions after multiple martensitic transformations, one can deduce the capability of fragmentation and grain refinement of an austenite phase[4, 6].|$|R
30|$|Thus, the {{multiple}} thermocycling of alloy 1 with ongoing direct γ-α and reverse α-γ <b>martensite</b> <b>transformations</b> led to {{fragmentation of the}} initial austenite up to a nanoscale level (nanofragmentation).|$|R
30|$|Accumulation of the dislocations at {{multiple}} f.c.c.-b.c.c.-f.c.c. <b>martensite</b> <b>transformations</b> in iron-nickel alloys led to full recrystallization of austenite {{due to the}} formation of lattice fragments with significant mutual misorientation and to a transformation of the single-crystalline sample into a polycrystalline one.|$|R
50|$|The {{diffusion}} {{transformation is}} very time-dependent. Cooling a metal will usually suppress the precipitation {{to a much}} lower temperature. Austenite, for example, usually only exists above the upper critical temperature. However, if the austenite is cooled quickly enough, the transformation may be suppressed for hundreds of degrees below the lower critical temperature. Such austenite is highly unstable and, if given enough time, will precipitate into various microstructures of ferrite and cementite. The cooling rate {{can be used to}} control the rate of grain growth or can even be used to produce partially martensitic microstructures. However, the <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation</b> is time-independent. If the alloy is cooled to the <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation</b> (Ms) temperature before other microstructures can fully form, the transformation will usually occur at just under the speed of sound.|$|E
50|$|However, greater {{undercooling}} by rapid quenching {{results in}} {{formation of martensite}} or bainite instead of pearlite. This is possible provided the cooling rate is such that the cooling curve intersects the martensite start temperature or the bainite start curve before intersecting the Ps curve. The <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation</b> being a diffusionless shear transformation is represented by a straight line to signify the martensite start temperature.|$|E
50|$|Induction {{hardening}} is {{a surface}} hardening technique {{in which the}} surface of the metal is heated very quickly, using a no-contact method of induction heating. The alloy is then quenched, producing a <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation</b> at the surface while leaving the underlying metal unchanged. This creates a very hard, wear resistant surface while maintaining the proper toughness in the majority of the object. Crankshaft journals are a good example of an induction hardened surface.|$|E
30|$|Multiple f.c.c.-h.c.p.-f.c.c. <b>martensite</b> <b>trans{{formation}}s</b> in iron-manganese alloys, on {{the other}} hand, {{led to the formation}} of additional subgrain boundaries in austenite by accumulation of CPD up to a magnitude exceeding 0.02. A full recrystallization of austenite at multiple f.c.c.-h.c.p.-f.c.c. and f.c.c.- 18 R-f.c.c. transformations was never observed.|$|R

50|$|In the {{martempering}} process, austenitized {{metal part}} is {{immersed in a}} bath at a temperature just above the martensite start temperature (Ms). By using interrupted quenching, the cooling is stopped at a point above the <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation</b> region to ensure sufficient time for the center to cool to the same temperature as the surface. The metal part is then removed from the bath and cooled in air to room temperature to permit the austenite to transform to martensite. Martempering is a method by which the stresses and strains generated during the quenching of a steel component can be controlled.|$|E
50|$|Because {{a smaller}} grain size usually enhances {{mechanical}} properties, such as toughness, shear strength and tensile strength, these metals are often heated to a temperature {{that is just}} above the upper critical-temperature, {{in order to prevent}} the grains of solution from growing too large. For instance, when steel is heated above the upper critical-temperature, small grains of austenite form. These grow larger as temperature is increased. When cooled very quickly, during a <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation,</b> the austenite grain-size directly affects the martensitic grain-size. Larger grains have large grain-boundaries, which serve as weak spots in the structure. The grain size is usually controlled to reduce the probability of breakage.|$|E
5000|$|When {{austenite}} is cooled slow {{enough that}} a <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation</b> does not occur, the austenite grain size {{will have an}} effect on the rate of nucleation, but it is generally temperature and the rate of cooling that controls the grain size and microstructure. When austenite is cooled extremely slow, it will form large ferrite crystals filled with spherical inclusions of cementite. This microstructure is referred to as [...] "sphereoidite." [...] If cooled a little faster, then coarse pearlite will form. Even faster, and fine pearlite will form. If cooled even faster, bainite will form. Similarly, these microstructures will also form if cooled to a specific temperature and then held there for a certain time.|$|E

30|$|The {{effect of}} <b>martensite</b> <b>transformations</b> of {{different}} types on the misorientation of austenite crystalline lattice, which characterizes the degree of structure fragmentation, was investigated for Fe-Ni and Fe-Mn alloys. As a result of multiple face-centered cubic (f.c.c.)-body-centered cubic (b.c.c.)-f.c.c. transformations, an austenite single-crystalline specimen is transformed in a polycrystalline one due to progressive fragmentation. It was shown {{that the degree of}} fragmentation depends on the magnitude of volume change and the density of dislocations generated on martensitic transformations.|$|R

The study methods are: the simulators and the approaches, which {{were based on the}} conception of local pseudopotential, the method of linear "muffin-tin" orbits; the procedures and the methods, which were developed in the dynamics of lattice and in the theory of diffuse scattering.

50|$|Most {{non-ferrous}} alloys {{are also}} heated {{in order to}} form a solution. Most often, these are then cooled very quickly to produce a <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation,</b> putting the solution into a supersaturated state. The alloy, being in a much softer state, may then be cold worked. This cold working increases the strength and hardness of the alloy, and the defects caused by plastic deformation tend to speed up precipitation, increasing the hardness beyond what is normal for the alloy. Even if not cold worked, the solutes in these alloys will usually precipitate, although the process may take much longer. Sometimes these metals are then heated to a temperature that is below the lower critical (A1) temperature, preventing recrystallization, in order to speed-up the precipitation.|$|E
50|$|The {{base metal}} iron of the iron-carbon alloy known as steel, {{undergoes}} {{a change in}} the arrangement (allotropy) of the atoms of its crystal matrix at a certain temperature (usually between 1500 F and 1600 F, depending on carbon content). This allows the smaller carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal. When this diffusion happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in solution in the iron, forming a particular single, homogeneous, crystalline phase called austenite. If the steel is cooled slowly, the carbon can diffuse out of the iron and it will gradually revert to its low temperature allotrope. During slow cooling, the carbon atoms will no longer be as soluble with the iron, and will be forced to precipitate out of solution, nucleating into a more concentrated form of iron carbide (Fe3C) in the spaces between the pure iron crystals. The steel then becomes heterogeneous, as it is formed of two phases, the iron-carbon phase called cementite (or carbide), and pure iron ferrite. Such a heat treatment produces a steel that is rather soft. If the steel is cooled quickly, however, the carbon atoms will not have time to diffuse and precipitate out as carbide, but will be trapped within the iron crystals. When rapidly cooled, a diffusionless (<b>martensite)</b> <b>transformation</b> occurs, in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution. This causes the iron crystals to deform as the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, leaving those crystals very hard but much less ductile (more brittle).|$|E

The multiple regression method was used. Four equations were established allowing to calculate temperature of the start area of ferrite, perlite, bainite and martensite at the given cooling rate. The calculation results obtained do not allow to determine the cooling rate range of ferritic, pearlitic, bainitic and <b>martensite</b> <b>transformations.</b> Classifiers based on logistic regression or neural network were established to solve this problem...|$|R
40|$|Many new {{applications}} of ferroelastic materials require {{a better understanding}} of their dynamics that often involve phase transformations. In such cases, an important prerequisite is the understanding of wave propagation caused by pulse-like loadings. In the present study, a mathematical model is developed to analyze the wave propagation process in shape memory alloy rods. The first order <b>martensite</b> <b>transformations</b> and associated thermo-mechanical coupling effects are accounted for by employing the modified Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire theory. The Landau-type free energy function is employed to characterize different phases, while a Ginzburg term is introduced to account for energy contributions from phase boundaries. The effect of internal friction is represented by a Rayleigh dissipation term. The resulted nonlinear system of PDEs is reduced to a differential-algebraic system, and Chebyshev's collocation method is employed together with the backward differentiation method. A series of numerical experiments are performed. Wave propagations caused by impact loadings are analyzed for different initial temperatures. It is demonstrated that coupled waves will be induced in the material. Such waves will be dissipated and dispersed during the propagation process, and phase transformations in the material will complicate their propagation patterns. Finally, the influence of internal friction and capillary effects on the process of wave propagation is analyzed numerically.

40|$|International audienceMost {{advanced}} {{high-strength steel}} products contain complex phases, including ferrite, bainite and martensite, which form successively during elaboration. It {{is essential to}} understand the effect of prior ferrite transformation on the subsequent bainite and <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation</b> kinetics to achieve precise control of the final microstructure. Nevertheless, {{the effect of the}} interface between the prior formed ferrite and the residual austenite (α/γ), together with the related chemical heterogeneity at the interface, on the subsequent phase transformations has been studied only rarely, and remains unclear. This study pays particular attention to the effect of the α/γ interface and its related concentration gradients on bainite and <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation.</b> It is shown that the interface and its related concentration gradients can play a very significant role on the subsequent bainite or <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation</b> kinetics: it retards bainite transformation whereas it accelerates <b>martensite</b> <b>transformation.</b> It is revealed from microprobe wavelength-dispersive spectrometry analysis and model calculations that there are both manganese and carbon gradients in front of the α/γ interface {{at the end of the}} ferrite transformation holding. The subsequent bainite transformation kinetics is controlled by the competition between the acceleration effect of the interface boundary itself and the retardation effect of the higher alloying concentration near the interface. <b>Martensite</b> <b>transformation</b> should initiate at the pre-existing dislocations in the center of the residual austenite grains, where the C and Mn contents are the lowest.
