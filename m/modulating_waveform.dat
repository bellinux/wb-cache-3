Introduction The technique of direct digital synthesis (DDS) is gaining popularity as a method of generating sinusoidal signals in digital systems [5]. This technique is especially well suited to software radio systems implemented on architectures which use general purpose processors (GPPs) because these systems often have large amounts of main memory available for storage of pre-computed output samples. These systems can therefore provide great flexibility in the type of waveforms which can be generated. The algorithms developed below show how DDS techniques can b [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The carrier is an RF signal, {{typically}} of microwave frequencies, {{which is}} usually (but not always) modulated to allow the system to capture the required data. In simple ranging radars, the carrier will be pulse modulated and in continuous wave systems, such as Doppler radar, modulation may not be required. Most systems use pulse modulation, with or without other supplementary modulating signals. Note that with pulse modulation, the carrier is simply switched on and off {{in sync with the}} pulses; the <b>modulating</b> <b>waveform</b> does not actually exist in the transmitted signal and the envelope of the pulse waveform is extracted from the demodulated carrier in the receiver. Although obvious when described, this point is often missed when pulse transmissions are first studied, leading to misunderstandings {{about the nature of the}} signal.|$|E
40|$|Technological {{constraints}} severely {{limit the}} rate at which analog-todigital converters can reliably sample signals. Recently, Tropp et al. proposed an architecture, termed the random demodulator (RD), that attempts to overcome this obstacle for sparse bandlimited signals. One integral component of the RD architecture is a white noiselike, bipolar <b>modulating</b> <b>waveform</b> that changes polarity at a rate equal to the signal bandwidth. Since there is a hardware limitation to how fast analog waveforms can change polarity without undergoing shape distortion, this leads to the RD also having a constraint on the maximum allowable bandwidth. In this paper, an extension of the RD, termed the constrained random demodulator (CRD), is proposed that bypasses this bottleneck by replacing the original <b>modulating</b> <b>waveform</b> with a run-length limited (RLL) <b>modulating</b> <b>waveform</b> that changes polarity at a slower rate than the signal bandwidth. One of the main contributions of the paper is establishing that the CRD, despite employing a <b>modulating</b> <b>waveform</b> with correlations, enjoys some theoretical guarantees for certain RLL waveforms. In addition, for a given sampling rate and rate of change in the <b>modulating</b> <b>waveform</b> polarity, numerical simulations confirm that the CRD, using an appropriate RLL waveform, can sample a signal with an even wider bandwidth without a significant loss in performance. 1...|$|E

In contrast, neurons that responded transiently to steady-state tones usually exhibited greater responsiveness to TRAM tones than to SAM. Neurons with sustained responses to steady-state tones responded strongly to both types of modulated tones. The selectivity for modulator type suggests that transient neurons may play a different functional role in the representation of envelopes than do other types of neurons...|$|E

Recently, Tropp et al. proposed a new architecture, called a random demodulator (RD), {{that attempts to}} circumvent this limitation by sampling sparse, bandlimited signals at a rate {{much lower than the}} Nyquist rate. An integral part of this architecture is a random bi-polar <b>modulating</b> <b>waveform</b> (MW) that changes polarity at the Nyquist rate of the input signal.
