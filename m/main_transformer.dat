25|$|On Friday, February 26, 1993, Ramzi Yousef and a Jordanian friend, Eyad Ismoil, drove {{a yellow}} Ryder van into Lower Manhattan, and {{pulled into the}} public parking garage beneath the World Trade Center around noon. They parked on the {{underground}} B-2 level. Yousef ignited the 20-foot fuse, and fled. Twelve minutes later, at 12:17:37p.m., the bomb exploded in the underground garage, generating an estimated pressure of 150,000 psi. The bomb opened a 30-m (98ft) wide hole through four sublevels of concrete. The detonation velocity of this bomb was about 15,000ft/s (4.5km/s).

40|$|Abstract [...] This {{paper is}} to {{investigate}} the power system operation strategy for an electrified mass rapid transit（MRT） network to enhance the loading factors of <b>main</b> <b>transformers.</b> The train motion equation {{has been applied to}} find the mechanical power demand profiles of the train set according to various operation modes by considering operation resistance. The DC load flow analysis is executed to derive the electric power loading of each traction substation and the AC load flow analysis is then performed to solve the dynamic loading behavior of <b>main</b> <b>transformers</b> for each time snapshot. To improve the loading factors of <b>main</b> <b>transformers,</b> the proper strategy of unit commitment and load transfer by switching operation are determined for the MRT operation during the peak and off peak periods. The Taipei MRT network is selected for computer simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. It is found that the loading factors of <b>main</b> <b>transformers</b> can be improved dramatically and the load balance among the transformers can be obtained by the proposed methodology...|$|R

25|$|In 2004, {{the basic}} TRAXX design was {{subjected}} to a major overhaul, with the carbody and the front redesigned to suit current crashworthiness standards, and the replacement of GTO thyristor based inverters with IGBT based inverters. The option of individual axle control in place of individual bogie control was also introduced. The coolant of the inverters and the <b>main</b> <b>transformer</b> was also changed from ester to water. The carbody design was completely standardised, by default providing a space for the mounting of a flip-disc display above the windshield, which is covered by a non-structural hood in freight versions. The bogie frame was strengthened, to allow an increase of axle loads to 22 tons. This generation of the family is {{also referred to as}} the TRAXX2 platform, and is sometimes also indicated with a number 2 {{at the end of the}} type designations.|$|E

Regular passenger service began on February10, 1935. 4800 remained in regular passenger service with the Pennsylvania, until it joined production GG1s 4801–4857 in the pool of [...] geared freight locomotives. It had its steam generator removed in June 1960, {{about a year after}} hauling a National Railway Historical Society-charted excursion to commemorate its 25th birthday.4800 continued to haul freight for the Pennsylvania and its successors Penn Central and Conrail. In 1976, Conrail gave 4800 a red, white and blue paint scheme to commemorate the United States Bicentennial. It was also the only GG1 to wear Conrail blue paint; all the other Conrail GG1s remained in black. 4800 was eventually retired by Conrail in October1979 after the locomotive's <b>main</b> <b>transformer</b> failed, which was deemed too expensive to repair.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Class 145 {{design was}} a cheaper derivative of the 12X, leaving away components for higher speeds, including hollow-shaft drives, which {{were replaced by}} simpler axle hung drives. In January 1996, ABB and Daimler-Benz merged their railway business areas into a joint venture, ADtranz. The final design of the locomotive was adapted for more commonalities with the DBAG Class 101. The biodegradable ester cooled inverters with GTO thyristors and the also ester cooled <b>main</b> <b>transformer</b> of the DBAG Class 145 was derived {{from those of the}} DBAG Class 101, but with less components for the lower maximum power, providing for individual bogie control rather than individual axle control. The bogie design was also adapted and merged into the ABB-originated Flexifloat family, with wheelbase increased to [...] Due to the shared features, the Class 145 was sometimes described {{as a member of the}} Eco2000 family.|$|E
2500|$|The {{competitors}} for the DB Class 121 {{included two}} of the forerunners of Bombardier Transportation: German locomotive manufacturer AEG Schienenfahrzeuge, a part of AEG which was controlled by Daimler-Benz at the time; and ABB Henschel, a German locomotive manufacturing branch of Swedish-Swiss company ABB. Components of both the AEG and ABB concepts were built into the prototypes of the DB Class 120 for trials from late 1991. AEG followed up its development effort by building an experimental universal locomotive, the 12X. This locomotive can be considered the predecessor of the TRAXX family. The 12X was delivered in June 1994 and, although owned by AEG, was designated Class 128 by DB. The 12X featured several innovations compared to the Class 120, including water-cooled inverters based on GTO thyristors, a new final drive concept with pivot axle bearings on both sides, and a new bogie concept with a short wheelbase of [...] The locomotive also had a modular design, allowing the derivation of different versions for different operational needs, and thus it formed AEG's basis {{to compete for the}} new orders of Deutsche Bahn's business areas. [...] Meanwhile, ABB developed its own design of a modular electric locomotive platform, the Eco2000 concept. ABB's concept included a version of its Flexifloat high-speed bogie family with a wheelbase of and biodegradable ester cooled inverters with GTO thyristors and an also ester cooled <b>main</b> <b>transformer,</b> which can be considered the origin of the inverters and transformer of the first generation of TRAXX locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|The Pioneer III cars {{suffered}} from a low capacity <b>main</b> <b>transformer</b> as well as gearbox issues and a complex propulsion system that coupled highly sensitive mercury arc ignitron rectifier tubes with an inefficient DC resistance motor controller. [...] Always distinguishable by their older style diamond pantograph, the Pioneer III cars were rechristened the Silverliner Is when the second official order of Silverliners were delivered from Saint Louis Car Company in 1967, the SL-Is would also be renumbered 244 to 248 when the Silverliner IV fleet was delivered in 1974-1975. [...] The 6th car, {{which would have been}} #249, had already been written off in an accident by that time. [...] While the other Silverliner models all came with similar GE propulsion gear, they could not MU with the earlier Silverliner I cars, which soon became the odd ducks in the SEPTA Regional Rail fleet. In the late 1980s SEPTA purchased a number of push-pull trainsets to provide enough peak period capacity to retire its remaining Reading Blueliners and the Silverliner Is by the timetable that took effect April 1, 1990. [...] Until 2000, the cars were kept in storage near Wayne Junction. Although there were plans to convert the cars into locomotive-hauled coaches, SEPTA finally decided to dispose of the fleet due to the expense it would have taken to deal with PCBs in the transformers and the lack of ADA compliance. Of the 5 surviving cars, three were sent to the AAR/FRA test site in Pueblo, Colorado for use in crash tests, while the remaining 2 Pioneer III/Silverliner I cars, 246 and 247, were donated to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} method to {{evaluate}} power supply capability of distribution system considering the connection mode of high voltage network. Firstly, based on the operation mode and load transfer of distribution network, the grid structure is simplified by forming incidence matrices between <b>main</b> <b>transformers</b> and high voltage distribution lines. Then a nonlinear programming model of power supply capability is developed through N- 1 contingency analysis of high voltage distribution lines and <b>main</b> <b>transformers,</b> and the power supply capability of a distribution system {{can be obtained by}} solving the relevant model. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by a case study...|$|R
