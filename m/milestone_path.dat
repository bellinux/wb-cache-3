The first major <b>milestone</b> on this <b>path</b> was the detection of small volumes of nuclear spins, close to those volumes pre-viously achieved by MRFM, except at room temperature. This was done by two groups simultaneously (7, 8). In the latter work, the technique was pushed a step farther by inter-rogating the nuclear spin ensemble to give information on their local environment. By applying these techniques to single proteins, low-resolution images should be possible. However, ultimately atomic-scale resolution image of proteins are needed, at least in th...|$|R

By constraining the dates associated with <b>milestones,</b> the critical <b>path</b> can be determined for major schedule intervals in addition to the entire project. Slack/float can also be calculated on each schedule interval. This segmentation of the project schedule into intervals allows earlier indication of schedule problems and a better view into the activities whose completion is critical.|$|R

It established transportation as a viable and interesting theme; other similar models followed, including a cowboy-influenced covered wagon and a soap-box racer.

Martin and Cheese- Face were two savages, of the stone age, of the squatting place and the tree refuge.

Additionally, we design a new multi-agent competitive environment, RoboSumo, and define iterated adaptation games for testing various aspects of continuous adaptation strategies. We demonstrate that meta-learning enables significantly more efficient adaptation than reactive baselines in the few-shot regime.

Yet, the Court’s surprising decision to allow states to opt out of expanding Medicaid could result in coverage looking a bit like Swiss cheese, with big gaps for the most vulnerable, rather than the seamless expansion of coverage originally expected. GUARANTEED COVERAGE FOR ALL EXCEPT THE POOR? The Supreme Court upheld the ACA’s most contro-versial requirement, that people pay a penalty if they choose not to buy health insurance.

40|$|Given the {{critical}} nature of communications in computational Grids {{it is important}} to develop efficient, intelligent, and adaptive communication mechanisms. An important <b>milestone</b> on that <b>path</b> is the development of classification mechanisms that can distinguish between causes of data loss in cluster and Grid environments. In this paper, we investigate one promising approach to developing such classification mechanisms based on the analysis of what may be termed packet-loss signatures that describe the patterns of packet loss in the current transmission window. We analyze these signatures using complexity theory to learn about their underlying structure (or lack thereof), and are mapping the relationship between the complexity metrics and the system conditions responsible for their generation. We show that complexity measures are an excellent metric upon which a classification mechanism can be built. Further, we show how such a classification mechanism can be built based on the application of Bayesian statistics...|$|R

40|$|With the aim {{to develop}} {{effective}} and selective human tyrosinase inhibitors, we investigated aurone derivatives whose B-ring {{was replaced by}} a non-oxidizable 2 -hydroxypyridine-N-oxide (HOPNO) moiety. These aurones were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of purified human tyrosinase. Excellent inhibition activity was revealed and rationalized by theoretical calculations. The aurone backbone was especially found to play a crucial role, as the HOPNO moiety alone provided very modest activity on human tyrosinase. Furthermore, the in vitro activity was confirmed by measuring the melanogenesis suppression ability of the compounds in melanoma cell lysates and whole cells. Our study reveals that HOPNO-embedded 6 -hydroxyaurone is to date the most effective inhibitor of isolated human tyrosinase.
