5|$|A 1994 {{study of}} the nilgai's diet in the Sariska Reserve {{revealed}} its preference for herbs and grasses; grasses became <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rainy season, while during winter and summer it fed additionally on flowers (Butea monosperma), foliage (Anogeissus pendula, Capparis sepiaria, Grewia flavescens and Zizyphus mauritiana), pods (Acacia nilotica, A. catechu and A. leucophloea) and fruits (Zizyphus mauritiana). Preferred grass species include Cenchrus species, Cynodon dactylon, Desmostachya bipinnata, Scirpus tuberosus and Vetiveria zizanoides. Woody plants eaten include Acacia nilotica, A. senegal, A. leucophloea, Clerodendrum phlomidis, Crotalaria burhia, Indigofera oblongifolia, Morus alba and Zizyphus nummularia; herbs favoured are Cocculus hirsutus, Euphorbia hirta and Sida rhombifolia. Seeds of Paspalum distichum occurred in the dung of nilgai most of the year; Acacia nilotica and Prosopis juliflora seeds were discovered in the dry season and those of Echinochloa crusgalli during the monsoon.|$|E
5|$|Dawson Creek is a {{regional}} node for air, rail, and bus services. The Dawson Creek Airport, which services commercial flights by Central Mountain Air, {{was built in}} 1963; its 1,524m (5,000ft) runway was paved in 1966. There are larger airports in Fort St. John and Grande Prairie that maintain more comprehensive flight schedules. Passenger rail service was available in Dawson Creek between 1931 and 1974. Service began when the Northern Alberta Railways (NAR) built its northwest terminus in the town and was extended in 1958 to Vancouver with a rail line through the Rocky Mountains. Passenger rail service ended as commodity shipments of grains, oil and gas by-products, and forestry products became <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> resource-based economy. Greyhound Lines maintains a bus station in Dawson Creek which connects the city to Vancouver, Edmonton (via Grande Prairie), and Whitehorse (via Fort Nelson).|$|E

25|$|Opinions {{differ on}} the {{effectiveness}} of the Q-ships. One source regards them as greatly overrated, diverting skilled seamen from other duties without sinking enough U-boats to justify the strategy, while another suggests Q-ships were all the <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early stages of the fight against the U-boat because so few methods had appeared to work, though their effectiveness declined as the war at sea progressed.|$|E
25|$|<b>More</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city's {{history was}} the {{discovery}} {{of oil in the}} region during the 1920s.

The oil industry in Big Spring reached its peak during the oil boom of the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Parking fees {{had been}} {{listed as a}} major {{deterrent}} to downtown shopping on the Eugene Mall. In 1973 the city created a free parking zone around the mall that included 2200 spaces with no time limits. Effects on retail sales from the free parking zone may have been marginal, and the plan further limited city revenue. Bates found that concerns over parking at pedestrian malls are much <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States than in Europe.|$|E

25|$|While Fath Ali Shah himself {{never visited}} Europe, many portraits of him were sent with envoys {{in the effort}} to convey the {{imperial}} majesty of the Persian court.

In addition, as Nassirudin Shah was the first Persian ruler to visit Europe, the official sending of portraits was left by the wayside, a relic of times gone by.|$|E
25|$|As {{globalization}} {{has become more}} prevalent, international activity has also become an increasingly prominent element of comprehensive campaigns. In many ways, the building of international coalitions of trade unions, environmental groups, consumer federations and others has been an element of comprehensive campaigns since the mid-1980s. American labor unions had little occasion to engage in international activity in the past. In the 2000s, international coalition-building—especially with unions in Western Europe (who represent workers at, and have strong working relationships with, the parent companies of American subsidiaries)—became far <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S.|$|E
25|$|The Taíno had a matrilineal {{system of}} kinship, descent and {{inheritance}}. When a male heir was not present, the inheritance or succession {{would go to}} the oldest male child of the deceased's sister. The Taíno had avunculocal post-marital residence, meaning a newly married couple lived in the household of the maternal uncle. He was <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lives of his niece's children than their biological father; the uncle introduced the boys to men's societies. Some Taíno practiced polygamy. Men, and sometimes women, might have two or three spouses. A few caciques had as many as 30 wives.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two ways}} to {{approach}} these symptoms using drugs: rate control and rhythm control. Rate control seeks to reduce the heart rate to one that is closer to normal, usually 60 to 100bpm, without trying to convert to a regular rhythm. Rhythm control seeks to restore with cardioversion the regular heart rhythm and maintain it with drugs. Studies suggest that rhythm control is mainly a concern in newly diagnosed AF, while rate control is <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chronic phase. Rate control with anticoagulation is as effective a treatment as rhythm control in long term mortality studies, the AFFIRM Trial.|$|E
25|$|Desalination of {{seawater}} {{is expected}} to become <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future through a long-planned regional desalination plant that would provide desalinated water using the piped water network throughout the entire Gaza strip. For over 20 years, a major desalination plant for Gaza has been discussed. The Palestinian Water Authority has approved a $500 million facility. Israel supports it and has quietly begun to offer Palestinians desalination training. In 2012 the French government committed a 10 million-euro grant for the plant. Arab countries, coordinated by the Islamic Development Bank, committed to provide half of the necessary funds, matching an expected European financial commitment. The European Investment Bank provides technical assistance.|$|E
25|$|In {{the western}} Atlantic, the spiny {{butterfly}} ray feeds on fishes, including Leiognathus and small sharks, and squids. Off Tunisia, they feed on crustaceans, teleosts, cephalopods, lamellibranchs, and gastropods, {{in descending order}} of importance. Teleost fishes apparently become <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ray's diet with increasing size. An active predator, the ray typically approaches a prey item slowly before rapidly spinning around over it and striking the food with {{the leading edge of}} one of their pectoral fins. This behavior likely serves to stun the prey before capture, as the pectoral fins of butterfly rays contain a high proportion of red muscle and can deliver blows of substantial force.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Paris, Copeau needed a period of rest and reflection, but certain {{pressing}} tasks demanded his time. He finished the adaptation of The Winter's Tale, {{which would be the}} first offering when the theatre reopened in January 1920, and with Jouvet he oversaw the renovations to the stage and the lighting at the Vieux-Colombier. A unit set compatible with the dimensions of the stage area and the installation of an innovative lighting system controlled from backstagebaptized jouvetswere installed. <b>More</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes of Copeau, a school of dramatic arts remained essential if he was to realize the renewal of the theatre that had been his dream for over a decade.|$|E
25|$|The prosperous {{period of}} Mamluk rule {{came to an}} end in 1516, when the Ottoman Turks conquered Syria from the Mamluks after {{defeating}} them at the Battle of Marj Dabiq near Aleppo. Hama, and the rest of Syria, came under Ottoman rule from Constantinople. Under the Ottomans, Hama gradually became <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> administrative structure of the region. It was first made capital of one of the liwas ("districts") of the vilayet ("province") of Tripoli. Hama once again became an important center for trade routes running east from the Mediterranean coast into Asia. A number of khans ("caravansaries"s) were built in the city, like Khan Rustum Pasha which dates from 1556. Syria was later divided into three governorships and Hama was ruled by the governorship based at Aleppo.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the central}} {{highlands}} of Mexico, relatively little archeological {{work has been}} done in the Costa Grande area. However, recent digs have indicated that the region may have been <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past than previously thought. Human habitation has been dated in the area since at least 2000 B.C.E. Nearly 6,000 ceramic fragments 1,400 years old with Teotihuacan influence have been found in various sites along the Costa Grande. This find shows that the local Tepozteca, Cuitlateca and Tomil cultures had contact with larger interior cultures as well as closer cultures such as the Mezcala in the center and north of Guerrero. Most of the artifacts have been found in the Coyuca de Benítez Municipality as well as the Soledad de Maciel site in Petatlán and Tambuco in Acapulco. Many of the pieces were not imported from Teotihuacan, but are local products with Teotihucan designs.|$|E

25|$|With {{the start}} of the {{maritime}} expansion of Portugal in the 15th century, the country's land forces focused on overseas campaigns intended to conquer new territories in Africa, Asia and the Americas, that would form the Portuguese Empire. Among these many campaigns were the wars for the control of Morocco, the wars with the Ottoman Empire for the control of India and the Indian Ocean, the war with the Persian Empire for the control of the Persian Gulf and participation in the Abyssinian–Adal war in support of the Ethiopian Empire. The role of the ground forces was <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> campaigns of Morocco, that were fought mainly on land. A great part of the other overseas campaigns occurred at sea and so were led by the Portuguese Navy, but the ground forces had also an important role as boarding forces during naval battles and as landing forces in amphibious operations. In Europe, Portuguese ground forces engaged in the War of the Castilian Succession.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} framework {{used for}} American English from the 1940s to the 1990s {{was based on}} the idea of pitch phonemes, or tonemes. In the work of Trager and Smith there are four contrastive levels of pitch: low (1), middle (2), high (3), and very high (4). (Unfortunately, the important work of Kenneth Pike on the same subject had the four pitch levels labelled in the opposite way, with (1) being high and (4) being low). In its final form, the Trager and Smith system was highly complex, each pitch phoneme having four pitch allophones (or allotones); there was also a Terminal Contour to end an intonation clause, as well as four stress phonemes. Some generalizations using this formalism are given below. It {{should be noted that the}} American linguist Dwight Bolinger carried on a long campaign to argue that pitch contours were <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study of intonation than individual pitch levels.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{had arrived}} in {{southern}} Britain by 4000 BCE, and with it a neolithic culture. Some deforestation took place at that time, although during the Bronze Age, beginning in 2200 BCE, this became more widespread and systematic. Hampshire has few monuments to show from these early periods, although nearby Stonehenge was built in several phases at some time between 3100 and 2200 BCE. In the very late Bronze Age, fortified hilltop settlements known as hillforts {{began to appear in}} large numbers in many parts of Britain including Hampshire, and these became more and <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early and middle Iron Age; many of these are still visible in the landscape today and can be visited, notably Danebury Rings, the subject of a major study by archaeologist Barry Cunliffe. By this period, the people of Britain predominantly spoke a Celtic language, and their culture shared much in common with the Celts described by classical writers.|$|E
