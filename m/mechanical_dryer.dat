40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the alternative processing option from shrimp processing biowaste for local people in Khulna district-southwestern Bangladesh. A survey was conducted to know the existing situation. From the survey it was observed that sharp increase in shrimp production did not lead the increase in product from biowaste {{due to the lack of}} technical method. The respondents also revealed the lack of financial support and political influence as constraint and the main promising facility was the raw material availability and dried product demand. The waste cause heavy environmental pollution as most often these are dumped into water body or open field. A significantly high biological oxygen demand (p = 0. 05) was found in the Rupsha river, adjacent to about 16 processing plants. Therefore it could be concluded that a technical processing method could be introduced as a new arena to process waste with maximum drying rate for economic efficiency and microbiological quality. Also the minimum loss of essential components of the dried material and comparatively cheaper than any other <b>mechanical</b> <b>dryer</b> and do not require skilled labor to build with locally available material.

40|$|Sun drying is the {{traditional}} method for drying and still preferred in Asia because cheap compared to mechanical drying. Since it uses the sun as heat source it is friendly to the environment, many farmers, grain collectors, traders and millersoften dry their paddy on pavements that specifically constructed for drying. Sundrying pavements have the advantages of high capacity and thus economics of scale, but the weakness is very dependent on the weather. The amount of paddy that can be dried with a drying depends {{on the number of}} sunny days, so {{it is important to know}} the probabilities of rainy day based on the historical climate data in a region. From these, simulations can be done to calculate how many dryer machines should be provided to overcome the lack of drying capacity. This methodis known as Monte Carlo. This paper presents a study to determine the amount <b>mechanical</b> <b>dryer</b> needed based on the failure probability of sun drying pavements using monte carlo simulation methods in the District of Ciomas, Bogor. The study results based on 10 years daily rainfall data the probability of rainy days in March (0. 62) was greater than in September (0, 37), so that the total capacity of dryer machine to be prepared is 110 tons/ day.

40|$|Drying is a {{critical}} activity in rice postharvest handling. Any delay in drying will result in quality and quantity losses. Farmers and traders prefer to sell wet grain rather than dried grain of unhulled rice due to less attractive incentive {{for them to do}} drying. The study was conducted in Subang District, West Java, during March-June 2011 using survey method to analyze the financial feasibility of rice dryers. The respondents interviewed were 15 rice millers who have either sun-drying floor or <b>mechanical</b> <b>dryer,</b> or both. The main collected data were the investment cost, operational cost, maintenance cost, and the revenue of the dryers. The data were analyzed by using shortterm and long-term financial analyses to assess the profitability and feasibility of some drying technologies. The results showed that there were at least three drying technologies in the study area, namely sun-drying floor, flatbed dryer using gas fuel (gas dryer), and flatbed dryer using rice husk fuel (husk dryer). Under the mean capacity, the short-run MBCR of technological change from sun dryer to gas dryer was 1. 29, while from sun dryer to husk dryer was 1. 45. The long-run analysis showed that the IRRs were 44. 44 % for sun dryer, 233. 47 % for gas dryer, and 260. 49 % for husk dryer. These results showed that among the three drying technologies, husk dryer is the most profitable, most feasible, and most prospective to be adopted. Therefore, this type of dryer should be intensively promoted to the farmers’ group associations, rice traders, and rice millers. The government support in terms of rice dryers for farmers’ group associations should be focused on husk dryer. </p...|$|E

40|$|Harvest of the Philippines {{second and}} larger rice crop occurs during {{the end of}} the wet season. For members of the rice {{industry}} this wet season harvest poses a problem: grain cannot be dried reliably using traditional sundrying methods. Poor drying results in quality reductions and hence farmers receive lower returns. To address this situation the Philippines Government introduced locally manufactured <b>mechanical</b> <b>dryers.</b> This study was undertaken to examine variables which enhance or limit the continued use of the mobile flash dryers in farmers' co-operatives in Nueva Ecija, the Philippines. Two case studies, each consisting of three farmers' co-operatives were investigated using semi-structured interviews. One case comprised co-operatives that continue to use the dryer while the other comprised those that have stopped using it. Results showed that a combination of factors influenced the adoption decisions of the co-operatives. Economic factors, especially the volume of rice handled by the co-operative appeared to be most important. Furthermore, the way that the dryer fitted with the other postharvest systems in the co-operatives was a determinant of adoption decisions. In particular, the co-operatives with rice milling operations or with inadequate alternative drying options utilised the <b>mechanical</b> <b>dryers.</b> The leadership and management of the co- operative appeared also to be a factor. These results indicate that both organisational factors and the characteristics of a technology need to be considered in the development and extension of innovation. Overall the results of this work support the individual and organisational adoption literature. Further work could explore this issue on a wider basis across more co-operatives within the region and across more regions in the country.

There was various arrangement of drying condition for mechanical drying system such as using either 1 KH- 1 F or 1 KH- 2 F or 2 KH- 1 F or 2 KH- 2 F. While for solar drying either no fan or one fan or two fans were used. Different drying conditions were applied by changing the heating source and flow of air. The highest temperature was obtained in 2 KH- 1 F condition for mechanical drying and convection gives highest temperature among different solar drying alternatives. The temperature in upper shelf for different solar operational condition ranged from 1. 53 to 1. 67 times of ambient temperature (250 C- 310 C) at peak time and 1. 28 to 1. 36 for lower shelf. The air velocity was 0. 35 m/sec and 0. 70 m/sec for 1 -fan and 2 -fan respectively. The performance of dryer was evaluated by drying potato slices having thickness 3, 5 and 7 mm. In both methods, drying rate increases with the increasing temperature and decreases with the increasing slice thickness following the power law equation. The values for the index ‘n ’ of the power law equation are less than 2 (range from 0. 53 to 1. 42) for all the conditions, this indicating that external resistance to mass transfer was significant and internal resistance to mass transfer did not control the drying process under the given conditions.

40|$|This Master’s Thesis {{is divided}} in the {{respective}} two parts: ‘Energy balance in a Thermal Assisted Mechanical Dewatering (TAMD) process’ and ‘Pinch analysis for Alfalfa TAMD dewatering’. The TAMD procedure is a solid/liquid separation process investigate at the RAPSODEE research center of ‘l’École des Mines d’Albí-Carmaux’. It consists in a hybrid {{process in which}} a temperature is applied {{at the same time}} as the mechanical dewatering process. In this way a bigger quantity of final dry solid content is obtained. The objective of the first and the most important Master’s Thesis part is to determinate if there is an energy saving with the use, as a separation process, of the TAMD process, instead of the habitual <b>mechanical</b> dewatering plus <b>dryer.</b> In this order, the necessary thermal energy in the TAMD process is calculated from the integration of its heat flow density. This heat flow density is obtained, from laboratory measured temperatures, by the Inverse Conduction Methodology that allows solving the direct problem by an iterative algorism. The MATLAB software is used to implement the algorism. To justify the use of the Inverse Methodology, the heat flow density is also calculated by the direct form and the results, obtained by each process, are compared. It can be seen that only the inverse methodology allows a good approximation in the thermal diffusion unstable period. The error standard deviation of measured temperatures, spread on the heat flux, is calculated to verify the goodness of the methodology. The optimal processing conditions are founded. Finally, the two necessary energies in mechanical dewatering plus drying and the TAMD process, to achieve the same final dry solid content, are calculated and compared. In this order, the ‘RD’ ratio, ratio between the energy required for drying and the latent heat of vaporization, is used. Energy savings can be seen using the process of TAMD (RD= 1. 25 for the normal dewatering process and RD= 0. 109 for the TAMD). The TAMD process can also be applied to Alfalfa dewatering. It must be followed by a thermal dryer to obtain the needed final dry solid content to use the product as animal feed. The application of the TAMD process to Alfalfa dewatering has the advantage, respect the usual procedure (thermal drying), that a green juice with great proprieties for the humans is obtained. Energy savings using the TAMD process, rather than the usual dewatering process, has also been determined using the inverse model in the first part of this Master's Thesis. We want to see if it’s possible to utilise the exhaust gases from the thermal dryer to give the necessary thermal energy at TAMD process through a heat exchanger. In this way, Pinch analysis is used. The Pinch bases are established, a mass and energy balance to obtain the necessary Pinch values is done, the hot and cold system streams are identified and a first Heat Interchange Network is determinate...|$|R
