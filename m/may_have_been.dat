5|$|After Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have {{proposed}} to France a preventive war against Germany. It has been argued that Piłsudski <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany. Lack of French interest <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a reason why Poland signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934.
