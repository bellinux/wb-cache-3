The implemented fluid-structure-interactions kernel is tailored for loosely coupled analysis, and is based on radial basis functions (RBF). Heterogeneous physics based analysis modules are orchestrated by an engineering environment based on the DLR’s central data model CPACS, and on the distributed framework RCE.

The flight path of a <b>medium-haul</b> twin-jet transport <b>aircraft</b> was optimized during microburst encounters on final approach. The assumed goal was to track a reference climb rate during an aborted landing, subject to a minimum airspeed constraint. The results demonstrated that the energy loss through the microburst significantly affected the qualitative nature of the optimal flight path. In microbursts of light to moderate strength, the aircraft was able to track the reference climb rate successfully. In severe microbursts, the minimum airspeed constraint in the optimization forced the aircraft to settle on a climb rate smaller than the target. A tradeoff was forced between the objectives of flight path tracking and stall prevention...|$|R

30|$|For some comparison, the {{emission}} rate {{of an average}} passenger car is around EMR =  140 gCO 2 /km. This is likely to decrease to about EMR =  130 gCO 2 /km by the year 2020. However, the new cars to be launched in the meantime {{are expected to have}} {{the emission}} rate of about EMR =  120 gCO 2 /km, which is just according to the EU proposals. In addition, this could be reduced to about EMR =  80 gCO 2 /km mainly thanks to more massive introduction of hybrid cars by the year 2030, and to about EMR =  57 gCO 2 /km during the period between the years 2040 and 2055 when the electric or fuel-cell cars are supposed to only really contribute to the more significant reduction of the above-mentioned emission rates. Similarly to the HS trains, this will be carried out in parallel to the changing the structure of the primary sources for producing electric energy. In addition, the fuel efficiency and related emissions of CO 2 and other GHG by APT competing with the HSR on the short- to medium-haul lines/routes will also be improved in the forthcoming decades. For example, the emission rate of CO 2 is expected to decrease from today’s average of EMR =  97 – 62 gCO 2 /s-km by the year 2025 to EMR =  47 and 41 gCO 2 /s-km by the years 2040 and 2055, respectively (the emission conversion factor is 1 g of Jet A fuel =  3.18 gCO 2 /s-km; the aircraft types considered are similar to today’s A 319 and B 737 - 800 models). The mentioned improvements are expected to be achieved by improving the aircraft airframe and engine efficiency. Beyond the year 2050, further improvements may be expected means by introducing the alternative fuels such as, for example, liquid hydrogen [6, 49]. Nevertheless, the above-mentioned figures indicate that the HSR systems will remain superior in terms of energy efficiency and related emissions of GHG (CO 2) as compared to its competitors—passenger cars and the short- to <b>medium-haul</b> commercial <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{compromise}} solution to increase flight efficiency in cruise, but without penalising capacity (or even safety), would be perhaps to remove (or relax) the minimum {{rate of climb}} (ROC) constraint and/or to reduce {{the height of the}} step climbs in cruise.

40|$|Increasing {{commonality}} {{across their}} models allows commercial aircraft manufacturers {{to reduce the}} product development cycle time and tailor their models to their customers’ needs. The cockpit {{is an area where}} commonality is thought to be particularly desirable, since it also simplifies the pilots training process for the airline companies. However, no set of metrics is currently able to measure the efficiency of commonality application at this level from a total lifecycle standpoint. In this paper, we propose a set of metrics adapted to large commercial aircraft and taking into account the main parts of the product lifecycle. The concept of lead time is central in our measurement of commonality, as it strongly influences the value of the aircraft for all primary stakeholders. We examine {{the extent to which these}} metrics are independent from aircraft particularities (such as physical dimensions).

40|$|Nowadays, {{civilian}} aircrafts {{occupy the}} major share of global aviation industry market. As {{to medium and}} long - haul aircrafts, turbofans with separate exhaust streams are widely used. Here, fuel efficiency is the main criterion of this engine. The paper presents the research results of the mutual influence of fan pressure ratio and bypass ratio on the effective specific fuel consumption. Shows the increasing bypass ratio to be a rational step for reducing the fuel consumption. Also considers the basic features of engines with a high bypass ratio. Among the other working process parameters, fan pressure ratio and bypass ratio are the most relevant for consideration as {{they are the most}} structural variables at a given level of technical excellence. The paper presents the dependence of the nacelle drag coefficient on the engine bypass ratio. For computation were adopted the projected parameters of prospective turbofans {{to be used in the}} power plant of the 180 -seat <b>medium-haul</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Computation of the engine cycle was performed in Mathcad using these data, with fan pressure ratio and bypass ratio being varied. The combustion chamber gas temperature, the overall pressure ratio and engine thrust remained constant. Pressure loss coefficients, the efficiency of the engine components and the amount of air taken for cooling also remained constant. The optimal parameters corresponding to the minimum effective specific fuel consumption were found as the result of computation. The paper gives recommendations for adjusting optimal parameters, depending on the considered external factors, such as weight of engine and required fuel reserve. The obtained data can be used to estimate parameters of future turbofan engines with high bypass ratio. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{aircraft}} cabin interior noise, the fuselage structural excitation by turbulent boundary- layer (TBL) flows is an important noise source for aircraft manufacturers to deal with. Aircraft at cruise conditions are flying at high Mach numbers, typically between Ma = 0. 78 [...] . 0. 85, dependent on the type and mission of the aircraft. At these flight conditions, the TBL around the fuselage is turbulent and features regions with high turbulence intensity. The vortices within the TBL cause pressure fluctuations on the fuselage and therefore, its structure receives energy and starts to vibrate. This vibration is inter alia dependent on the flow velocity and thus, {{the strength of the}} TBL. Due to advanced low-noise engine technologies the TBL remains the dominating source of cabin noise at current state-of-the-art aircraft. Therefore, Airbus has launched dedicated research efforts to characterize the TBL as a source of cabin acoustics and to predict the induced structural excitation of any fuselage section. Especially in an early design stage sufficiently precise noise level estimates are important to evaluate/optimize design variants (e. g. different aircraft shapes) from an acoustical viewpoint. Today's semi-empirical models to predict the TBL-induced pressure fluctuations have been mainly developed on the basis of wind-tunnel tests on flat plates. Correspondingly, these commonly applied predictions are not applicable in areas subjected to disturbed flows (i. e. at the junction between the wing and fuselage, the cockpit or tail regions). A universal prediction approach requires more detailed model descriptions of the TBL strength and spatiotemporal development as characterized by the surface pressure auto-spectrum and wavenumber-frequency spectrum, respectively. In this paper an approach is presented {{to bridge the gap between}} simple flat plate estimates and higher fidelity predictions based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational aeroacoustics (CAA). As the result of an in-depth literature review on available auto-spectrum models the semi-empirical GOODY model was selected and extended to cover arbitrary regions of the fuselage. In the new approach aerodynamic parameters are directly taken from CFD calculations. Besides, the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) was identified as major driving quantity and was therefore, included in the new model. This new model was derived and verified using measured auto-spectra from flight tests, performed on the Advanced Technology Research Aircraft (ATRA) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), an Airbus A 320. It is therefore valid in a large parameter space, covering the operational range of a short- to <b>medium-haul</b> <b>aircraft.</b> In parallel, a fully numerical procedure is proposed to predict the auto-spectrum as well as the wavenumber-frequency spectrum by making use of the Fast Random Particle-Mesh Method (FRPM) of the DLR. In selected areas the FRPM approach provides both auto-spectra and wavenumber-frequency spectra with high prediction quality. Currently, the method is limited to frequencies below or equal 2500 Hz. Beside these source modeling activities, rhombic and elliptical wavenumber-frequency models from literature are reviewed and the effect on a flat plate vibrational response is described. This study is conducted by using GRAHAM's method implemented in Matlab and by a commercial implementation in an Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) software package. Both approaches show equal results for the flat plate test. Finally, the developed auto-spectrum model, the different reviewed wavenumber spectrum models, the FRPM-based predictions and a wavenumber spectrum model fitted to ATRA flight test data are used as variable inputs for an SEA at the real aircraft. For the SEA computations the commercial software VA One is employed with Airbus A 320 SEA models used for research and development at Airbus. Structural vibration data, estimated with these models are finally compared with measured structural vibrations from flight tests in different areas of the aircraft. Estimated structural vibrations give an overall good collapse with the measured accelerations. However, detailed parametrical comparisons indicate the individual weaknesses of different wavenumber-frequency models in distinct frequency ranges. Especially in the low frequency range semi-empirical models tend to deviate from measurements...|$|E
