The <b>maximum</b> <b>spread</b> factor <b>of</b> impacting drops measured perpendicular to grooves; beta(m,perpendicular to) is seen to be less than, that:measured parallel to grooves, beta(m,perpendicular to). The difference between beta(m,perpendicular to), and beta(m,parallel to) increases with drop impact velocity. This deviation of beta(m,perpendicular to) from beta(m,parallel to) is analyzed by considering the possible mechanisms, correspond, ing to experimental observations (1) impregnation of drop into the grooves, (2) convex shape of liquid vapor interface near contact line at <b>maximum</b> <b>spreading,</b> and (3) contact line pinning <b>of</b> <b>spreading</b> drop at the pillar edges by incorporating them into an energy conservation-based model.

A unified model, incorporating all the above-mentioned mechanisms, is formulated, which predicts beta(m,perpendicular to) on several groove-textured surfaces made of intrinsically hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials with an average error of 8. 3 %.

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to identify responsive areas for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertiliser use on rice (Oryza sativa L.) within Takeo province from trial results obtained at 2336 sites. Regression tree analysis identified in order of decreasing importance the following factors which explained the variation in yield from on-farm experiments: season, location, fertiliser, soil type. Semi variograms of the same data set indicated that a <b>maximum</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> 12 km in datum points was required to map yield across the province. Separating the results into N response classes decreased the <b>maximum</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> datum for mapping to only 8 km.

Between March 2008 and August 2011 a total of 171 patients (184 legs) with a median age of 43. 5 (IQR 24, 54) years were assessed. Of those, 94 (51. 1 %) legs were diagnosed with lymphedema.

It is known that PWS patients with medium to high epidermal melanin concentrations are at {{a high risk of}} epidermal thermal damage after laser irradiation. To avoid this complication, it is necessary to maximize CSC efficiency and, thus, essential to understand the mechanical and thermal interactions of cryogen droplets with the sprayed surface. It has been observed that cryogen sprays exhibit droplet rebound as droplets impinge on the skin surface. Studies of water droplet impact on hard surfaces have shown that droplet rebound may be suppressed by dissolving small amounts (a few percent) of diverse polymer or surfactant solutions prior to atomization. To investigate the possibility of suppressing the rebound of cryogen droplets in a similar way, we have constructed a device that allows observation <b>of</b> the impact, <b>spreading,</b> and rebound <b>of</b> individual water and cryogen droplets with and without these solutions, and their influence on cryogen/surface dynamics and heat transfer.

We apply Timing Extraction to the Logic Array Block (LAB) on an Altera Cyclone III FPGA to obtain a view of the delay down to near individual LUT granularity, characterizing components with delays on the order of a few hundred picoseconds with a resolution of ± 3. 2 ps. This information reveals that the 65 nm process used has, on average, random variation of σ/µ = 4. 0 % with components having an average <b>maximum</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> 83 ps. Timing Extraction also shows that as VDD decreases from 1. 2 V to 0. 9 V in a Cyclone IV 60 nm FPGA, paths slow down and variation increases from σ/µ = 4. 3 % to σ/µ = 5. 8 %, a clear indication that lowering VDD magnifies the impact of random variation...|$|R
