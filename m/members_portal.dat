40|$|Theoretical and {{numerical}} {{research into}} the application of cellular beam-column <b>members</b> in <b>portal</b> frame structures. Two failure mechanisms requiring additional research if cellular beams are to be applied as column members, have been investigated: 1) member flexural buckling, and 2) local web-post buckling. The flexural buckling behaviour of cellular columns {{has been shown to}} be similar to that of plain-webbed beams. A simplified design rule is proposed for checking the ultimate flexural buckling load capacity of cellular columns, and is shown to yield safe results. From an extensive parameter study an approximately linear relation between the web-post buckling capacity and an applied axial force has been shown to exist. Even although this influence is not effectively accounted for in the present available models for web-post buckling, these still turn out to be sufficiently conservative to be applied in column design. Results are applied to the design of a portal frame consisting entirely of cellular members, by means of a design tool developed in Microsoft Excel using VBA. This tool has been validated against 2 D and 3 D finite element analyses for different load cases using the finite element software SAFIR.

Then {{the device is}} applied to container crane based on a seesaw mechanism. The major advantage of the seesaw damping system is that the long tension cables can be utilized as bracing between the seesaw <b>member</b> and the <b>portal</b> legs to avoid compression and buckling of the cables. A simplified trilinear force-displacement model {{on the basis of}} experimental results is adopted to represent the hysteretic behavior of AFD. After that, seismic responses of container crane with and without dampers to four earthquakes are studied using nonlinear dynamic time-history analysis. Besides this system, a diagonal-brace-AFD system is studied for comparison. A method based on the displacement and energy dissipation ratio is proposed to find the optimum slip force for seesaw damping system. Performance of AFD control system is assessed though various parameters including displacement and maximum portal frame drift angle.

40|$|A new online social {{formation}} {{representing the}} peculiar hybrid {{of community and}} commerce constitutes fertile ground for investigation – the affinity portal. In contrast to universal portals, affinity portals are oriented towards specific populations marketers believe comprise profitable niche markets. The keystone of the affinity portal model {{is the image of}} community, and by invoking community these portals invite the emotional investment of patrons. However, unlike those online communities evolving organically from the interactions of their <b>members,</b> affinity <b>portals</b> are engineered by corporations as commercial ventures. ^ Located at the intersection of three important trends shaping the media landscape – the commercialization of cyberspace, the shift from mass marketing to target marketing, and the growing pervasiveness of consumer surveillance – these affinity portals constitute a useful point of entry into a broader discussion of online community formation and identity construction under the conditions of late capitalism. Certainly these commercial community sites raise a host of compelling questions: What impact does the commodification of online communities have on civic engagement? Can sites predicated on target marketing still function as loci for community empowerment? What are the politics of commercial communities? ^ In addressing these questions, this study focuses on those affinity portals targeting communities that have historically been politically, economically, or socially marginalized in the United States – women, African Americans, Latinos/Latinas, Asian Americans, and sexual minorities. Specifically, this study looks at iVillage. com (the largest commercial site targeting women), Gay. com and PlanetOut. com (the largest affinity portals targeting sexual minorities), and BlackPlanet. com, AsianAvenue. com, and MiGente. com (the largest sites targeting racial and ethnic minorities). The decision to focus on these sites is based on the corollary that online communities serving historically marginalized groups have a special responsibility for honoring the voice of their members because of the potential of these sites to serve as tools of empowerment. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{research}} project aimed at investigating the response mechanism of a composite moment-resisting frame system with self-centering and energy dissipation capabilities. The suggested configuration of a particular composite beam and column <b>members</b> in a <b>portal</b> frame structure, serving as a simplified example of a moment-resisting frame system, can accommodate relatively large, inelastic deflections of the beam without formation of plastic hinges at the column bases. The combination of engineered cementitious composites (ECC) and fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) reinforcement results in column elements with relatively high flexural strength and sufficient elastic deflection capacity to permit frame sway and prevent {{the formation of a}} collapse mechanism due to lateral loading. The load-deformation response is primarily influenced by an intrinsic transition mechanism of the relative flexural stiffness of beam and column members, triggered by the formation of plastic hinges in the beam. This concept is theoretically outlined and experimentally verified by tests using small-scale frame specimens under reversed cyclic loading conditions. Furthermore, the response of the tested specimens is analytically derived and compared with experimentally obtained data. The spectrum of responses obtained with this suggested configuration demonstrates the potential to design this configuration for a specific bilinear system behavior...|$|R

The study was conducted in a university setting and selected students were initially contacted about their participation in the survey either thru an e-mail message or thru their own customised university portal. Survey findings revealed that the e-mail alternative resulted in a significantly higher overall response rate.

This structure is located just east of Ames, on Thirteenth Street extended, and spans the Skunk River at this point. [ [...] . ] As previously stated this bridge is located near Ames Iowa, and is a 120 -foot span, 20 -foot roadway, through riveted steel highway bridge, with an 8 -inch concrete floor on steel stringers. A view of the bridge is shown in Fig. 1 and elevation of the truss in Fig. 2. The bridge was designed under the Iowa State Highway Commission Specifications of 1919 and is a T-type, through riveted Pratt truss. In planning the work it was thot {{that it would be}} possible to make a complete study of the action of the bridge during erection. This would have resulted in the measurement of the erection stresses, the stresses due to the weight of the steel and the stresses due to the weight of the concrete floor. Conditions and lack of time caused the scope of the work to be reduced to the measurements of the floor load stresses. These stress measurements were taken on all of the members at the two upper and two lower panel points at the east end of the north truss of the bridge. From these readings we obtained the primary and secondary stresses in the structure, and a comparison of the observed and computed value will be made. In this connection a study of the distribution of stress in the upper chords and end post was also deemed advisable. A complete study of the observed and computed stresses in the transverse bents was also made.

The trans-Pacific axial enabling this twin launch is emblematic of the many axes of dialogue that, it is to be hoped, will characterize the content and reception of this and future issues of Portal. We are grateful to the many people at the Center for Social Sciences and Humanities at la Universidad de Guadalajara, México, for their provision of the technologies and tequila that will facilitate Portal's digital launch in a different space and timezone to its 'homebirth' in Sydney, Australia. As PORTAL's 'Focus and Scope' statement indicates, the journal is dedicated to publishing scholarship by practitioners of-and dissenters from-international, regional, area, migration, and ethnic studies. PORTAL is also committed to providing a space for cultural producers interested in the internationalization of cultures. With these aims in mind we have conceived PORTAL as a "multidisciplinary venture," to use Michel Chaouli's words. That is, PORTAL signifies "a place where researchers [and cultural producers] are exposed to different ways of posing questions and proffering answers, without creating out of their differing disciplinary languages a common theoretical or methodological pidgin" (2003, p. 57). Our hope is that scholars working in the humanities, social sciences, and potentially other disciplinary areas, will encounter in PORTAL a range of critical and creative scenarios about contemporary societies and cultures and their material and imaginative relation to processes of transnationalization, polyculturation, transmigration, globalization, and anti-globalization. Our use of scenario here is drawn from Néstor García Canclini, for whom the term designates "a place where a story is staged" (1995, p. 273). García Canclini's interest lies in comprehending the staging of stories at "the intercrossings on the borders between countries, in the fluid networks that interconnect towns, ethnic groups, and classes, … the popular and the cultured, the national and the foreign" (1995, p. 273). Such stories indicate some of the many possible international scenarios that PORTAL will stage in the future. A key to our ambitions for PORTAL is an editorial commitment to facilitating dialogue between international studies practitioners working anywhere in the world, and not simply or exclusively in the "North," "the West," or the "First World. " This fundamental policy is reflected in our Editorial Board, with members drawn from respected academic and research institutions in many countries and continents. We would like to extend our warmest thanks to the many people across the globe who, site unseen, graciously agreed to support this publishing and intellectual endeavour by joining the Editorial Board and wholeheartedly endorsing the journal's editorial brief. PORTAL's commitment to fashioning a genuinely "international" studies rubric is also reflected in our willingness to accept critical and creative work in English as well as {{in a number of other}} languages: Bahasa Indonesia, Chinese, Croatian, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, and Serbian. We anticipate that this list will grow. Portal is also committed to the timely and constructive provision of feedback to submitted work. There will be two issues per year: one in January, the other in July. These editorial protocols make PORTAL a uniquely "international" publishing venture. Immense gratitude is due to the team at UTSePress for their dedication to, and faith in, this project. In particular, we would like to thank Alex Byrne, Fides Lawton, Richard Buggy, and Shannon Elbourne, for their hard work, support, and understanding. Thanks go to all the <b>members</b> of the <b>PORTAL</b> Editorial Committee for their contributions. Finally, special thanks to our Editorial Assistant Wayne Peake, Research Assistant John McPhillips and Editorial Committee member Kate Barclay who did so much to ensure the appearance of this inaugural issue.
