5|$|I have then {{considered}} <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> {{a particle}} broken {{off from the}} grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel that I was still {{a part of a}} mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E
5|$|It's not {{my natural}} {{inclination}} to see <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a brand, I'm just {{a person who}} has been fortunate to explore other interests and passions outside of the game I love. I will always be associated with my sport but I am now working across other areas that will continue long after my career has finished.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{describing}} Fuller's movements {{after her}} time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but {{found it difficult to}} realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, and I can only write <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.|$|E

5|$|Fellow {{citizens}} & compatriots—I am besieged, by {{a thousand}} {{or more of}} the Mexicans under Santa Anna—I have sustained a continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken—I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism & everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch—The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> long as possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country—'Victory or Death.|$|E

25|$|I see <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> {{that little}} girl, crying myself {{to sleep at}} night, crying and wishing I could go home to my family. Everything's gone, the loss of your culture, the loss of your family, all these things have a big impact.|$|E

6000|$|... "I see {{now that}} I despised jealousy because I assumed that it was {{impossible}} for Amanda to love any one but me; it was intolerable to imagine anything else, I insisted upon believing that she was <b>as</b> fastidious <b>as</b> <b>myself</b> and <b>as</b> faithful <b>as</b> <b>myself,</b> made indeed after my image, and I went on disregarding the most obvious intimations that she was not, until that still moment in the Indian Ocean, when silently, gently as a drowned body might rise out of the depths of a pool, that knowledge of love dead and honour gone for ever floated up into my consciousness.|$|R
25|$|The oratory having increased, by {{the grace}} of God, with the coming {{together}} of prelates and of most important gentlemen, it seemed to me fitting in this second book to increase the harmony and the combination of parts, varying the music in diverse ways, now setting it to Latin words and now to the vernacular, sometimes with a greater number of voices and sometimes with fewer, with verses now of one kind and now of another, concerning <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> little as possible with imitations and complexities, in order not to obscure the understanding of the words.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the humiliation of demotion, he did not resign {{immediately}} from service {{and it has been}} suggested that this was because he needed his salary to support the publication of The Game Birds of India that he was working on. Hume retired from the civil service only in 1882. In 1883 he wrote an open letter to the graduates of Calcutta University, calling upon them to form their own national political movement. This led in 1885 to the first session of the Indian National Congress held in Bombay. In 1887 writing to the Public Commission of India he made what was then a statement unexpected from a civil servant — I look upon <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a Native of India.|$|E
25|$|Subjectivity {{comes with}} {{consciousness}} of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a self. It encompasses {{the emotional and}} intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is {{to decide how to}} choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.|$|E

25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E

It's fun collaborating with them at this point".|$|E
500|$|P.S.

500|$|During 1968, Biden clerked for {{six months}} at a Wilmington law firm headed by {{prominent}} local Republican William Prickett and, as he later said, [...] "thought of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a Republican". He disliked the conservative racial politics of incumbent Democratic Governor of Delaware Charles L. Terry and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968. The local Republicans tried to recruit him, but he resisted due to his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon, and registered as an Independent instead.|$|E

500|$|At school, Ripley enjoyed drama lessons, {{spurred on by}} the {{positive}} remarks she received from her drama teacher Susan Ford. She said of Ford, [...] "When I was 15, {{one of the few}} people who said, 'Well done', was my drama teacher, and she was really brilliant. She was a powerful woman. Those women change your life. You always remember them. There was something about her. She basically made me feel very good about <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a 15-year-old girl." [...] Abandoning her childhood ambition to become a nurse, Ripley decided to go into acting.|$|E
500|$|The song is {{included}} on the U.S. release of The Essential Mariah Carey. [...] On Carey's official Facebook page on May 12, 2012, shortly after the release, she wrote, [...] "I spent four years writing this song, only because after I performed in Schenectady, NY, I started hearing this melody and singing {{it over and over}} to <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> I was taking a bath, looking at the moon.. Four years later, as I was leaving a devastating part of my life behind, I wrote the second verse, the bridge and the outro." ...|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Alvarez said, [...] "I {{think of}} <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> having had two {{separate}} careers, one {{in science and}} one in aviation. I've found the two almost equally rewarding." [...] An important contributor to this was his enjoyment of flying. He learned to fly in 1933, later earning instrument and multi-engine ratings. Over the next 50 years he accumulated over 1000 hours of flight time, most of it as pilot in command. He said, [...] "I found few activities as satisfying as being pilot in command with responsibility for my passengers' lives." ...|$|E
