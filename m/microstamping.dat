Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Biological engineering. Neurons and neuroendocrine cells contain vesicles packed with hormones or neurotransmitters. Upon appropriate stimulation, a rise in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration triggers the fusion of vesicles with the outer membrane of cells and release of vesicle contents into the extracellular space in a process called exocytosis. In this thesis, we developed three new nano- and micro- techniques to study exocytosis. 1. We used scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) to image changes in the surface membrane of adrenal chromaffin cells after stimulation of exocytosis. Punctate depressions were noted in clusters of two or more. Increases in membrane surface area, consistent with the fusion and collapse of one or more vesicles into the surface membrane, were observed 64 % of the cells. 2. We used a microcontact printing method with PDMS stamps by "soft" lithography to pattern microislands of rat hippocampal neurons to form autapses. Neurons on <b>microstamped</b> microislands survived and grew neurites for more than 21 days and resembled microisland cultures formed by the traditional method of spraying collagen on agarose coated substrates. 3. Microfabricated devices were developed to electrochemically measure quantal catecholamine release from an array of individual cells. Here we report patterning of cellsized holes in [tilde operator] 15 m-thick films. These films are placed on transparent indium tin oxide electrodes to insulate the unused part of the electrode whereas the holes in the film both determine the location of the working electrode and serve as pockets for cell trapping. We found that this approach represents a simple and effective way to target cells to electrodes to record amperometric spikes...|$|R

5000|$|The United States National Research Council {{released}} a report in 2008 that endorsed the investigation of <b>microstamping</b> {{as an alternative to}} ballistic markings.

It described <b>microstamping</b> as a [...] "promising method" [...] that could [...] "attain the same basic goal as the proposed database".|$|E

50|$|<b>Microstamping</b> is a {{ballistics}} identification technology. Microscopic markings are engraved {{onto the}} tip of the firing pin and onto the breech face of a firearm with a laser. When the gun is fired, these etchings are transferred to the primer by the firing pin and to the cartridge case head by the breech face, using the pressure created when a round is fired. After being fired, if the cases are recovered by police, the microscopic markings imprinted on the cartridges can then be examined by forensic ballistics experts to help trace the firearm to the last registered owner. A California law requiring the use of <b>microstamping</b> technology in all new semiautomatic firearms sold in the state has attracted controversy.|$|E

50|$|While {{the concept}} of {{stamping}} sheet metal components has traditionally focused on the macro level (e.g. vehicle, aircraft, and packaging applications), the continuing trend of miniaturization has driven research into micro- forms of stamping. From the early development of micropunching machines {{in the early to}} mid-2000s to the creation and testing of a microbending machine at Northwestern University in the 2010s, <b>microstamping</b> tools continue to be researched as alternatives to machining and chemical etching. Examples of applications of sheet metal <b>microstamping</b> include electrical connectors, micromeshes, microswitches, microcups for electron guns, wristwatch components, handheld device components, and medical devices. However, key issues such as quality control, high-volume application, and the need for material research into mechanical properties must be addressed before full-scale implementation of the technology is realized.|$|E

50|$|On May 17, 2013, {{the state}} {{attorney}} general began enforcing a new law requiring that semi-automatic pistols incorporate <b>microstamping.</b> With this technology, very small markings are engraved, using a laser, on the tip of the firing pin and on the breechface of the firearm. When the gun is fired, these etchings may be transferred to the primer by the firing pin, and to the cartridge case head by the breechface, using the pressure created when a round is fired. If successful, this imprints two identifying numbers, unique to that gun, on each spent cartridge casing. This requirement applies to new guns being added to the California Department of Justice's roster of handguns certified for sale; semi-automatic handgun models already listed on the roster are not required to incorporate <b>microstamping.</b> Note of interest - this law was passed in 2007 and the wording in the law stated that it shall become effective when {{there are at least two}} companies, unencumbered by a patent, employing this technology.

40|$|As {{demands on}} the forming of micro-products increase, {{ensuring}} the high-quality design of machine-tool systems becomes increasingly more important. This is particularly due to a need to address smaller geometries and finer tolerance requirements, compared to those of conventional forming.

Detailed finiteelement modelling of stamping tool systems has, however, not been addressed previously. Difficulties tend to arise when many tool parts {{need to be considered}} in the modelling. In this paper, dynamic analysis of a microsheet-forming system driven by a linear motor is presented.

40|$|ABSTRACT Microarrays with biomolecules (e. g., DNA and proteins), cells, and tissues {{immobilized on}} solid {{substrates}} are important tools for biological research, including genomics, proteomics, and cell analysis. In this paper, {{the current state}} of microarray fabrication is reviewed. According to spot formation techniques, methods are categorized as “contact printing ” and “non-contact printing. ” Contact printing is a widely used technology, comprising methods such as contact pin printing and <b>microstamping.</b> These methods have many ad-vantages, including reproducibility of printed spots and facile maintenance, as well as drawbacks, including low-throughput fabrication of arrays. Non-contact printing techniques are newer and more varied, comprising photochemistry-based methods, laser writing, electrospray deposition, and inkjet technologies. These technologies emerged from other applications and have the potential to increase microarray fabrication throughput; however, there are several chal-lenges in applying them to microarray fabrication, including interference from satellite drops and biomolecule denaturization...|$|E
