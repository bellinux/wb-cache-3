500|$|Speaking for MTV News, Jay-Z {{responded to}} Braxton's claims: [...] "I wouldn't {{want to take}} it from her. I don't even think like that. My first thought would be, 'Maybe I could call her up, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get on that record.' The most obvious [...] is it's neither one of our records. It's not like you made an {{original}} idea. She's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. We go to sample the same thing and my record came out first. I'm sorry. What can I do?" [...] He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{had said}} that he was {{attracted}} to the initial novel based on how [...] "raw and honest" [...] it felt. In an interview with AMC he noted that reading the book brought back a memory from his childhood of a young abused girl who knocked on his family's door, claiming that her mom was going to kill her. Daniels recalls that the incident {{was the first time he}} saw his mother frightened, specifically noting the helplessness of the situation, and stating [...] "she knew that she’d have to send this little girl home, and that was what disturbed her— that she couldn’t save her. She tried to make it easier for her. That’s all she could do." [...] In creating the movie Daniels hoped that the experience would be cathartic and that [...] "maybe I could heal. And <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> heal other people, too." [...] Another stated goal Daniels had was to challenge the general public's perception of incest.|$|E
500|$|The {{international}} {{version for}} Living Proof opens with [...] "The Music's No Good Without You", a disco-inspired song filled with [...] "hypnotic synth lines", while Cher's vocals are manipulated with Auto-Tune {{which made her}} sound like the [...] "embodiment of a haunted extra-terrestrial". The following track [...] "Alive Again" [...] {{is described as a}} [...] "trance anthem", and its lyrics revolve around Cher singing about the [...] "broken world of a dissolved relationship". [...] "I only wanna learn to feel the rain/Then <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stop the leaves from falling/I only wanna learn to freeze the flame/I know I'll be alive again", she sings during the chorus. Third song [...] "Song for the Lonely" [...] lyrically [...] "evokes September 11", and addresses subjects such as heroism, longing, bravery and perseverance over a disco beat. Musically, it abandons electronic instruments in favor of a more pure and impassioned performance. The following track, [...] "A Different Kind of Love Song" [...] lyrically alludes to themes of tragedy, heroism and brotherhood, while musically it has [...] "cloud-scrapping chorus, breezy melody, and a kitschy production tics", including Cher's heavily processed vocals by Auto-Tune.|$|E

500|$|As {{the sets}} were {{being built in}} Las Vegas, {{producer}} Frank Mancuso, Jr., son of Paramount president Frank Mancuso, Sr., had the screenplay rewritten in secret, and gave Bakshi a new screenplay by screenwriters Michael Grais and Mark Victor that [...] "was barely the same". Larry Gross {{also contributed to the}} script, but his work would later go on to be uncredited. In interviews {{at the time of the}} film's release, Mancuso, Jr., who was best known for the Friday the 13th franchise, stated a desire to move away from horror films, and wanted to produce a film [...] "about what happens when someone creates a world, becomes defined by it, and then can't escape [...] a film about being trapped by your own creation." [...] Bakshi remembers that he got into a fight with Mancuso, Jr. and [...] "punched [...] in the mouth." [...] Paramount threatened Bakshi with a lawsuit if he refused to complete the film. [...] "I thought if I did the animation well, it would be worth it, but you know what? It wasn't worth it." [...] Bakshi also stated that he [...] "had a lot of animators there that I'd brought in and I thought that <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> just have fun animating this stuff, which I did." [...] Bakshi had developed the film as a mix of comedy and horror that he described as [...] "a hard R-rated story" [...] but Paramount wanted a PG-13 film, one of the reasons for the doomed and angry relationship between filmmaker and studio.|$|E
2500|$|She {{stated in}} 2007, [...] "I don't {{understand}} why women {{feel the need}} to go into acting as soon as they become famous ... But I suppose if the part were aesthetically correct, then <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> consider it." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Freddie Lee's suggestion, The Shriekers {{began taking}} {{jobs in the}} same German clubs where the Beatles had cut their teeth a few years earlier.

50|$|This film {{captured}} {{my imagination}} so much. It {{was the first}} film that I saw that {{made me realize that}} somebody has to make this stuff. Somebody has to build those sets. Somebody has to paint those paintings. All of a sudden it became accessible. The movie was so compelling and interesting to me on so many levels. The one thing that struck me was that somebody made a movie, and that it was something that <b>maybe,</b> possibly, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do.|$|R

2500|$|Sontag {{was quoted}} by Editor-in-Chief Brendan Lemon of Out {{magazine}} as saying [...] "I {{grew up in}} a time when the modus operandi was the 'open secret'. I'm used to that, and quite OK with it. Intellectually, I know why I haven't spoken more about my sexuality, but I do wonder if I haven't repressed something there to my detriment. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have given comfort to some people if I had dealt with the subject of my private sexuality more, but it's never been my prime mission to give comfort, unless somebody's in drastic need. I'd rather give pleasure, or shake things up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kondabolu {{attended}} {{public schools}} in Queens: PS 69 in Jackson Heights, PS 115 in Floral Park, MS 172 in Floral Park, and Townsend Harris High School in Flushing, where he graduated in 2000. While a high school student, Kondabolu repeatedly watched a Margaret Cho special on the then-new Comedy Central cable network [...] "in awe, because up until then I had never seen an Asian-American comedian. There she was up there—strong and funny and talking about her parents. That {{was the first time}} I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> try this." [...] He began writing and performing in comic skits in his global studies class at Townsend Harris, and produced and performed in a comedy night during his senior year.|$|E
2500|$|E: Yes, I {{did not do}} it consciously. I saw all the sunset, but I didn't see {{the fence}} and large boulder that were there. I blocked out {{everything}} except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days. When I finally awakened, I asked my father why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became aware of my lack of abilities, I wondered how I was going to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal. [...] "Why Young Folks Leave the Farm." [...] I no longer had the strength to be a farmer, but <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make it as a doctor.|$|E

But I was soon lapped back into my life in London; and thought only of Mr Anon, as I am apt to think of God: namely, when I needed his presence and his help. As a matter of fact, I had small time to think. Even the doubts and misgivings that occasionally woke me in the night melted like dreams in the morning. Every morrow blotted out its yesterday--as faded flowers are flung away out of a vase.|$|R
5000|$|Described as a [...] "by the book" [...] type {{of general}} manager, Turpin was a stern, well-groomed man. He worked without salary, but did receive {{stock in the}} line, from 1918 until 1926. At its height, the Beaver, Mead and Englewood Railroad ran from Beaver, to Eva, Oklahoma, with an {{extension}} and connection to the Santa Fe Railroad in Keyes. The line connected with the Katy at Forgan and the Rock Island at Hooker. The BM&E was eventually sold to M-K-T (Katy) Railroad Company in 1931. [...] "When I was a kid 20 years old, but married, I used to {{want to work for}} a railroad which paid $50 a month and furnished its agents a two-story house on the line, rent, brooms, and matches free. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> still <b>could</b> find something like that," [...] Turpin said, after the sale of the Beaver, Mead and Englewood Railroad.|$|R

2500|$|In 1981, Jones met Nancy Sepulvado, a 34-year-old divorcée from Mansfield, Louisiana. [...] Sepulvado's {{positive}} impact on Jones' life and career cannot be overstated; she eventually cleaned up his finances, kept him away from his drug dealers (who reportedly kidnapped her daughter in retaliation), and managed his career. [...] Jones always gave her complete credit for saving his life. [...] Nancy, who did not drink, explained to Nick Tosches in 1994, [...] "He was drinking but he was fun to be around. [...] It wasn't {{love at first sight}} or anything like that. [...] But I saw what a good person he was, deep down, and I couldn't help caring about him." [...] Jones managed to quit cocaine but went on a drunken rampage in Alabama in fall 1983 and was once again straitjacketed and committed to Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital suffering from malnutrition and delusions. [...] But by that time, physically and emotionally exhausted, he really did want to quit drinking. [...] In March 1984 in Birmingham, Alabama - at the age of 52 - Jones performed his first sober show since the early seventies. [...] "All my life it seems like I've been running from something," [...] he told the United Press International in June. [...] "If I knew what it was, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> run in the right direction. [...] But I always seem to end up going the other way." [...] Jones began making up many of the dates he had missed, playing them for free to pay back promoters, and began opening his concerts with [...] "No Show Jones", a song he had written with Glen Martin that poked fun at himself and other country singers. [...] Jones always stressed that he was not proud of the way he treated loved ones and friends over the years and was ashamed of disappointing his fans when he missed shows, telling Billboard in 2006 that [...] "I know it hurt my fans in a way and I've always been sad about that, it really bothered me for a long time." ...|$|E

Pastis likened this unexpected collaboration to getting [...] "a glimpse of Bigfoot". [...] "I thought <b>maybe</b> Stephan and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do this goofy collaboration {{and then use}} the result to raise some money for Parkinson's research in honor of Richard Thompson. It seemed like a perfect convergence", Watterson told the Washington Post. [...] The day that Stephan Pastis returned to his own strip, he paid tribute to Watterson by alluding to the final Calvin and Hobbes strip from December 31, 1995.|$|R
2500|$|Campese further wrote that, [...] "In the World Cup {{match against}} South Africa, I kicked the ball {{three or four}} times when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have run. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> was worried my speed was going, and that was {{affecting}} my confidence, especially to counterattack." ...|$|R
