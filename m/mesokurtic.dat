40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{a method for}} {{generating}} discrimination criteria {{that can be used}} to identify strong patterns in stock market data. More effective criteria are necessary as short-term trades are often driven by noise rather than valid market signals- a viewpoint known as the "noisy trader " model of the stock market. To demonstrate why traditional technical analysis falls short, we applied the standard methods to a synthetic market generated by a random walk. Although the market data is engineered to be pure noise, technical analysis "discovers" strong features such as accumulation/distribution patterns, upward and downward trends, support and resistance levels. These secondary features represent noise in the technical indicators. By comparing the performance of these indicators between a real market and the synthetic noise market, real signals can be identified. We select a subset of technical indicators {T} such that each indicator T in this subset has a <b>mesokurtic</b> (usually, near-normal) distribution across the synthetic noise market. It turns out that many of the common measures (e. g. accumulation, relative strength, moving average trend direction) are <b>mesokurtic</b> for the noise market, but have strongly leptokurtic distributions across the actual stock market. We propose a method for using the kurtosis of such indicators T to separate the noise from the real signal in the indicators. Specifically, having obtained a <b>mesokurtic</b> baseline that corresponds to noise, we use the empirical real market distribution for indicator T to compute discrimination thresholds beyond which a value of T should be considered a strong signal. The strong signal concept is validated using historical price/volume data for the Standard & Poor’s 1500 (S&P 1500) set of stocks...|$|E

In this paper we develop and analyze a new skin colour segmentation based on HSI colour space using bivariate Pearsonian type-IIb mixture model.

40|$|MP {{estimation}} is {{a method}} which concerns estimating of the location parameters when the probabilistic models of observations differ from the normal distributions in the kurtosis or asymmetry. The system of Pearson’s distributions is the probabilistic basis for the method. So far, such a method was applied and analyzed mostly for leptokurtic or <b>mesokurtic</b> distributions (Pearson’s distributions of types IV or VII), which predominate practical cases. The analyses of geodetic or astronomical observations show that we may also deal with sets which have moderate asymmetry or small negative excess kurtosis. Asymmetry might result from the influence of many small systematic errors, which were not eliminated during preprocessing of data. The excess kurtosis can be related with bigger or smaller (in relations to the Hagen hypothesis) frequency of occurrence of the elementary errors which are close to zero. Considering that fact, this paper focuses on the estimation with application of the Pearson platykurtic distributions of types I or II.

40|$|Gaussian Bayesian {{networks}} are graphical models {{that represent the}} dependence structure of a multivariate normal random variable with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In Gaussian Bayesian networks the output is usually the conditional distribution of some unknown variables of interest given a set of evidential nodes whose values are known.

The aspect of non-normality to be considered is the tail behavior. In this line, the multivariate exponential power distribution is a family depending on a kurtosis parameter that goes from a leptokurtic to a platykurtic distribution with the normal as a <b>mesokurtic</b> distribution. Therefore a more general model can be considered using the multivariate exponential power distribution to describe the joint distribution of a Bayesian network, with a kurtosis parameter reflecting deviations from the normal distribution.

Onshore winds generates fi ne, well sorted, near symmetrical dune sands with <b>mesokurtic</b> distributions in the El Vizcaíno Desert inherited from beach sands from the Vizcaíno bay.

The catchment area is 11, 690 km 2. The surface area of the reservoiris 270 square kilometers and the volume is 6. 870 × 106 m 3 at normal operationlevel (El. 511. 00 m. a. s. l.). The minimum drawdown level is at elevation 469 mabove sea level (a. s. l.). The live storage is 6. 14 × 106 m 3 while the remainder is deadstorage. The reservoir has a surface area that reaches 270 square kilometers and iscomposed of two sub-reservoirs connected by a narrow channel that has a length of 5 kilometers. The relatively bigger reservoir is located in the north and has a triangularshape with a surface area approximately 250 square kilometers. The smaller sub-reservoiris located down south where the dam exists and it has irregular rectangularshape. Thirty-two sediment samples were collected from the bottom of Dukan reservoir. The bed of the reservoir is mainly composed of 15 % gravel, 14 % sand, 48 %silt and 23 % clay respectively. Most of the sediments are very fine grained, verypoorly sorted, strongly coarse skewed and <b>mesokurtic.</b> Validerad; 2016; Nivå 1; 2016 - 10 - 05 (marisr) 184312...|$|E

Sand predominates in the sediment samples and varies between 0. 3 and 68. 57 %; particles with silt-size fraction vary between 3. 01 and 26. 31 %. Gravel size fraction is low and occurs only in sediment samples of Units E and B, and varies between 0. 2 and 4. 44 %. The studied sediment sequence is dominated by sand units that are very fine-grained (e. g. FL_G, FL_F, FL_D and FL_C) to fine texture (FL_E and FL_A); the only exception is Unit FL_B that is medium grain sand. This deduction corroborates the computed mean size which varies between 1. 309 Ф to 3. 293 Ф. Computed standard deviation varies between 0. 622 Ф and 2. 274 Ф which illustrates that the sediments are very poorly sorted to moderately well-sorted sand. The skewness of the sediment samples ranges between- 0. 235 to 0. 278, and this implies that the sedimentary units are negatively skewed to positively skew. Computed kurtosis varies between 0. 856 and 1. 84, and based on the kurtosis values, distribution of particle size of the sedimentary units is classed as leptokurtic (e. g. FL_G and FL_D), very leptokurtic (e. g. FL_C), <b>mesokurtic</b> (e. g. FL_F and FL_A) and platykurtic (e. g. FL_E and FL_B). Consequently, the studied sediments are inferred to have deposited in moderate low energy environment. Bivariant plots of skewness versus standard deviation (or sorting) and mean size versus standard deviation shows that the sediments are dominantly river sands. However, the linear discriminate functions show an overlap of shallow marine and fluvial conditions of deposition for the sequence of sediments. The energy condition of the transporting medium and that of the depositional environment is inferred to be the dominant contro...|$|E
