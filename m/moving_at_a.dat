5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, {{that the laws}} of physics are the same in any system that is <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic {{studies of}} the {{brightest}} spiral nebulae to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae have high Doppler shifts, indicating that they are <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rate exceeding the velocity of the stars he had measured. He found {{that the majority of}} these nebulae are moving away from us.|$|E
5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} this strength, {{the storm}} slowed and gradually {{took a more}} northwesterly course, heading towards Pinar del Río Province in western Cuba. On September16, the system attained winds of 75mph (120km/h), what would now be considered a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. <b>Moving</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> slow pace of , the system gradually intensified. Late on September18, {{the center of the}} storm was estimated to have made landfall in Pinar del Río Province with winds of 100mph (155km/h); an atmospheric pressure of 976mbar (hPa; 28.82inHg) was recorded during its passage. The storm's eye passed over the town of Manta for four hours, between 3:00pm and 7:00pm on September17.|$|E
5|$|Between 1859 and 1866, he {{developed}} {{the theory of the}} distributions of velocities in particles of a gas, work later generalised by Ludwig Boltzmann. The formula, called the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, gives the fraction of gas molecules <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> specified velocity at any given temperature. In the kinetic theory, temperatures and heat involve only molecular movement. This approach generalised the previously established laws of thermodynamics and explained existing observations and experiments in a better way than had been achieved previously. Maxwell's work on thermodynamics led him to devise the thought experiment that {{came to be known as}} Maxwell's demon, where the second law of thermodynamics is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, 1997, the NEAR Shoemaker {{spacecraft}} passed within 1,212km of Mathilde while <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> {{velocity of}} 9.93km/s. This close approach allowed the spacecraft to capture over 500 {{images of the}} surface, and provided data for more accurate determinations of the asteroid's dimensions and mass (based on gravitational perturbation of the spacecraft). However, only one hemisphere of Mathilde was imaged during the fly-by. This was only the third asteroid to be imaged from a nearby distance, following 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida.|$|E

5|$|September 12, 1960– Hurricane Donna, {{the only}} {{tropical}} cyclone to bring hurricane-force winds to every {{state on the}} East Coast of the United States, passes New Jersey as a Category2 hurricane while <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> high speed. Damage is significant along the coastline, but is less than in other states struck directly by Donna. The hurricane causes winds gusts of up to 105mph (169km/h), heavy rainfall, and a storm surge of 6feet (2m). Well–executed warnings result in no direct deaths, though one indirect death occurs from a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Thermal inertia and the {{transfer}} of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the night and day sides, despite Venus's extremely slow rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> few kilometres per hour, {{but because of the}} high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through, even if the heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen were not a problem.|$|E

Sally previously worked with the Wachowskis as first assistant editor on Speed Racer and editor on Ninja Assassin. The Wachowskis found editing a TV show to be a challenging process because of the required fast turnaround times. Lilly commented that for a feature film they get a minimum of ten weeks for editing as mandated by the Directors Guild of America, while for the first season of Sense8 {{they had to be}} <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> pace of completing two 1-hour episodes (roughly the equivalent of a feature film) every two weeks.|$|E

5000|$|Molecules in a gas like {{nitrogen}} at {{room temperature}} at any instant are <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> average speed of nearly 500 miles per hour (210 m/s), repeatedly colliding and therefore exchanging energy so that their individual speeds are always changing. Assuming an ideal-gas model, average kinetic energy increases linearly with absolute temperature, so the average speed increases as the square root of temperature.|$|R

This creates a rather apparent goof in the film, whereby other characters in the background can be also seen <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> unrealistically accelerated rate, most notably Sergeant Apone, whose head can be seen {{moving up and down}} incredibly fast as he laughs.|$|R
5|$|Space Travel is a spaceflight {{simulation}} video game, {{presented in}} a two-dimensional top-down view, with monochrome graphics consisting of white lines on a black background. In it, the player controls a spaceship as it flies through {{a representation of the}} solar system. The game has no specific objectives, other than to attempt to land on the various planets and moons of the system. The planets and most of the moons in the solar system are represented to scale both in size and distance from each other, though the orbits are simplified to be circles. To land on a body, the player's ship must cross the line representing the surface while <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> low enough speed. The player is able to control the ship to go forwards and backwards and turn. The ship moves at a constant level of acceleration relative to the scale of the screen, which the player can control; scaling the screen up high enough allows the player to travel across the solar system in seconds, though they risk overshooting their target and becoming unable to find the solar system again, and scaling down allows the player to be moving slowly enough to land. The ship is always {{in the center of the}} screen, facing the top; turning the ship right or left therefore rotates the solar system around the ship instead.|$|E
5|$|T Aurigae (Nova Aurigae 1891) was a nova {{discovered}} at magnitude 5.0 on January 23, 1892, by Thomas David Anderson. It became {{visible to the}} naked eye by December 10, 1891, as shown on photographic plates examined after the nova's discovery. It then brightened by a factor of 2.5 from December 11 to December 20, when it reached a maximum magnitude of 4.4. T Aurigae faded slowly in January and February 1892, then faded quickly during March and April, reaching a magnitude of 15 in late April. However, its brightness began to increase in August, reaching magnitude 9.5, where it stayed until 1895. Over the subsequent two years, its brightness decreased to 11.5, and by 1903, it was approximately 14th magnitude. By 1925, it had reached its current magnitude of 15.5. When the nova was discovered, its spectrum showed material <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> high speed towards Earth. However, when the spectrum was examined again in August 1892, it appeared to be a planetary nebula. Observations at the Lick Observatory by Edward Emerson Barnard showed it to be disc-shaped, with clear nebulosity in a diameter of 3 arcseconds. The shell had a diameter of 12 arcseconds in 1943. T Aurigae is classified as a slow nova, similar to DQ Herculis. Like DQ Herculis, WZ Sagittae, Nova Persei 1901 and Nova Aquilae 1918, it is a very close binary with a very short period. T Aurigae's period of 4.905 hours, comparable to DQ Herculis's period of 4.65 hours, and has a partial eclipse period of 40 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} accelerated northeastward, {{and passed}} over the Hampton Roads area early on September 3. After crossing the Chesapeake Bay, the cyclone traversed the Delmarva Peninsula near the Atlantic coastline, and at around 1500UTC the eye passed directly over Cape Henlopen, Delaware; a thirty-minute period of calm was reported. It continued across the Delaware Bay and later passed over Cape May, New Jersey, where a fifteen-minute calm was reported. Modern researchers estimate it was a Category3 or Category4 hurricane upon striking New Jersey, {{one of the few}} hurricanes to hit the state. Moving ashore at very low tide, it paralleled the state's coastline just inland, and after exiting into Lower New York Bay the hurricane made landfall on New York City at around 1930UTC on September 3; this makes it the only major hurricane to directly hit the city. A minimal hurricane in 1893 also made landfall on what later became part of New York City. One modern researcher estimates the hurricane was <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> forward speed of 35mph (55km/h), and upon moving ashore had a pressure of 965mbar. The hurricane continued northeastward through New England, and after entering Massachusetts on September 4 its exact path was unknown; one researcher estimated the cyclone tracked northeastward until losing its identity over southeastern Maine, while another assessed the storm as passing far to the west of Maine.|$|E
