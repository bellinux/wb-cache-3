5000|$|A <b>married</b> <b>print</b> is a {{film print}} which has had an optical soundtrack added onto the print. As the process usually is fairly {{expensive}} and resource-intensive, it usually {{is one of the}} last stages of post-production. Due to the intermittent motion of movie projectors and movie cameras, the sound cannot be located adjacent to the actual frames it is synced to, but instead must be offset by 21 frames (35mm). Because of this, a <b>married</b> <b>print</b> can not be edited, and thus should only be done when the picture edit has been [...] "locked" [...] (as well as the sound, of course). Marrying a print is often done at the stage of the answer print, although this is not strictly a requirement.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the film}} was {{intended}} to use Antheil's score as a soundtrack, the two parts were not brought together until the 1990s. In 2000, Paul Lehrman produced a <b>married</b> <b>print</b> of the film. This version of {{the film was}} included in the DVD collection Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant Garde Film 1894-1941 released in October 2005.|$|E
50|$|The Academy {{ratio is}} not {{created in the}} camera, which has {{continued}} to use the full frame silent aperture gate for all 4-perf spherical filming. Rather, it is created in the <b>married</b> <b>print,</b> when the optical soundtrack and frame lines are added. Though most non-anamorphic film prints with a soundtrack are now framed {{to one of the}} non-anamorphic widescreen ratios, from 1.66 to 1.85, some still retain Academy-sized frames. These frames are then cropped in the projector by means of aperture masks used in the projector's gate in conjunction with a wider lens than would be used for projecting Academy ratio films.|$|E
5000|$|After {{her release}} Kirsch took {{work in a}} metal goods factory in the Wedding quarter of Berlin. She was still working there {{when the war ended}} in 1945, albeit not without {{interruption}} along the way. [...] Also following her release, she <b>married</b> the <b>print</b> worker Bruno Fredrich (1903-1943). He {{had been a member of}} the Communist Party before 1933. However, war resumed in 1939 and he was conscripted into the army. After 1943 he was listed as [...] "missing".|$|R
2500|$|Shore {{divorced}} {{from her first}} husband, William, in 1926. [...] At some point she <b>married</b> a <b>print</b> dealer, Henry Braxton, whom she also divorced in 1933. She married her third husband, Haskoll Gleichman, in 1939, but this marriage also ended in divorce, in 1945. In 1947 Shore, her daughter, and Gleichman were all named during hearings {{in front of the}} House Committee on Un-American Activities. By the mid-1950s she had moved back to New York City and became a teacher at NYU. [...] She died on March 29, 1970 in New York City at the age of 79.|$|R
50|$|Rambabu (Rajendra Prasad) {{works as}} an {{employee}} in a private company, its boss Kutumba Rao is a hatred of bachelor's due to his sister's flashback. Since Rambabu is a bachelor Kutumba Rao torches him a lot by telling all below dignity jobs. Due to the bondage agreement, Rambabu is neither able to resign nor able to get another job. One day his colleague Gurunadham (Brahmanandam) gives him an idea to lie to their boss {{that he is going}} to <b>marry.</b> So, he <b>prints</b> a duplicate wedding card by taking a handy photo of a girl and shows to his boss {{that he is going to}} marry her. After some time, the girl in the photo Jayalakshmi (Yamuna) suddenly arrives as his wife. Rest of the story is how is she? where from she came? which turns into a lot of humorous confusion drama.|$|R
5000|$|In interlock, {{since the}} sound is on a {{separate}} reel, it {{does not need to}} be offset from the image. Today, this system is usually used only for very low-budget or student productions, or for screening rough cuts of films before the creation of a final <b>married</b> <b>print.</b> Sync between the two reels is checked with SMPTE leader, also known as countdown leader. If the two reels are synced, there should be one frame of [...] "beep" [...] sound exactly on the [...] "2" [...] frame of the countdown - 2 seconds or 48 frames before the picture start.|$|E
50|$|Murphy's eighth film, Ballet mécanique, {{which he}} co-directed with the French artist Fernand Léger, premiered on 24 September 1924 at the Internationale Ausstellung neuer Theatertechnik (International Exposition for New Theater Technique) in Vienna. Considered {{one of the}} masterpieces of early {{experimental}} filmmaking, Ballet mécanique also included creative input from Man Ray and Ezra Pound, and {{was presented at the}} exposition by Frederick Kiesler. The film was scheduled to be screened with George Antheil's masterpiece of the same name. However, the music ran close to 30 minutes, while the film was 17 minutes long. In 2000, Paul Lehrman produced a <b>married</b> <b>print</b> of the film.|$|E
5000|$|Usually, non-anamorphic 4-perf {{films are}} filmed {{directly}} on the entire full frame silent aperture gate (1.33:1). When a <b>married</b> <b>print</b> is created, this frame is slightly re-cropped by the frame line and optical soundtrack down to Academy ratio (1.37:1). The movie projector then uses an aperture mask to soft matte the Academy frame to the intended aspect ratio (1.85:1 or 1.66:1). When the 4:3 fullscreen video master is created, many filmmakers may prefer to use the full Academy frame ("open matte") instead of creating a pan and scan version from within the 1.85 framing. Because the framing is increased vertically in the open matte process, {{the decision to use}} it needs to be made prior to shooting, so that the camera operator can frame for 1.85:1 and [...] "protect" [...] for 4:3; otherwise unintended objects such as boom microphones, cables, and light stands may appear in the open matte frame, thus requiring some amount of pan and scan in some or all scenes. Additionally, the unmatted 4:3 version will often throw off an otherwise tightly-framed shot and add an inordinate amount of headroom above actors (particularly with 1.85:1).|$|E
5000|$|The next day, {{he leaves}} Jane {{a note saying}} that [...] "Death lies ahead" [...] if they {{continue}} their romance. After many adventures, Sheriff Sweat of Springville, Pennsylvania, finally apprehends Dean, but Jane picks {{him up in the}} museum car, which is discovered by the police. A chase ensues. While hiding in the woods, the couple discusses the eighth tablet of Neferus, which says [...] "marriage." [...] After hopping a refrigerator car, the couple is brought before a kindly judge, who dismisses the charges brought against them so that they can <b>marry.</b> The papers <b>print</b> that Jane is to marry a hobo. Although reluctant to make his bad luck worse, Dean marries Jane in New York, but then must face her father, who accuses him of being a fortune hunter. Dr. Ellison, head of the expedition, gives Dean a fake missing fragment of the ninth and last tablet for a wedding present, which Jane has inscribed with the story of Neferus saving Anebi from her father, who has abducted her. Dean boards what he believes is the Van Burens' yacht and fights for his bride, destroying the yacht, to the delight of Van Buren, who now accepts him. Jane then realizes Dean fought for her knowing the tablet was fake. The couple is united and, years later, as an old man, Dean finally finds the real ninth tablet, which assures him {{he is not going to}} die tomorrow.|$|R
