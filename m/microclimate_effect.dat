The objective was to study factors affecting SOM in the major soils of Sinana-Dinsho, Agarfa and Gassera districts of Bale highland in 2005. During the process major soil parameters affecting SOM storage as affected by land use systems in 0 - 5, 5 - 15, 15 - 30 and 30 - 60 cm soil depths were evaluated. Climate, land use, soil depth and texture {{were some of the}} major factors considered. With respect to climate all the land use in this study were topographically in the highlands and higher average annual rainfall went with higher SOC storage. Sinana-Dinsho forest site contained the highest SOC contents although under protected virgin natural forest park. Some <b>microclimate</b> <b>effect</b> might have affected the direct effect of increase of SOC with increasing altitude, lower average annual rain fall of Agarfa as compared to that of Gassera district. Some of the sites in Agarfa district lied in drier or desertified highland (extension of “Shanaka dry land plain to Agarfa Technical College) and Gassera sites received more rainfall as a result of <b>microclimate</b> <b>effect</b> around hill side and rivers in its surrounding Gorge. The result indicated that the distribution and abundance of SOC was varied independently in all land use systems. There was consistent decrease in SOC storage with increasing soil depth in all land use systems in all locations. The soil was clay in texture and was negatively correlated with SOC stocks. The low level ofSOC as a result of intensive cultivation and improper land use management calls fo...|$|E

40|$|Urban heat {{island is}} an {{anthropogenic}} phenomenon affecting urban outdoor thermal comfort conditions and energy utilization. This is even truer in urban canyon conﬁgurations, characterized by low sky view factor {{and where the}} effect of short-wave and long-wave solar radiation on construction surfaces is able to produce massive outdoor local overheating. Traditional solutions cannot always be applied in urban historical canyons, where the exteriors of buildings cannot be modiﬁed due to preservation. Here, the capability of innovative cool materials to mitigate local microclimate of historical urban canyons is investigated. A preliminary experimental characterization of the materials is performed. A numerical simulation of the <b>microclimate</b> <b>effect</b> generated by the application of such materials is performed. Results show that the proposed materials improve the microclimate without neglecting preservation constrains. Such materials set the best scenarios in terms of thermal comfort, by enhancing albedo on canyon surfaces. Their application on the vertical surfaces of narrow canyons can lead to deleterious effects on outdoor thermal comfort. Such ﬁndings are conﬁrmed by PMV and MOCI analyses.

Pacific climate patterns, particularly in response to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, affect local temperature, atmospheric circulation, snow accumulation, and water isotope signals at Siple Dome. We examined borehole temperatures, accumulation, and water isotopes from a number of shallow ice cores recovered from a 60 km north–south transect of the Dome. The data (with coverage from 1920 – 1995) reveal a microclimate heavily influenced by ENSO and the location of the Amundsen Sea Low Pressure Area. The Dome Summit and Pacific Flank respond to La Niña conditions by warming, increased isotope ratios, higher deuterium excess, and increased snowfall. The Inland Flank responds to El Niño conditions and cold interior air masses by cooling, decreased isotope ratios, lower deuterium excess, and decreased snowfall. ENSO-type spectral signatures (2 – 7 yr) are present in all water isotope records, but are not similar in their power structures. A longer 300 yr wavelet analysis record from the Dome Summit shows a late 19 th-century climate shift similar to that seen in South Pacific coral isotope records.

To mitigate these adverse effects, land use planners and urban designers have used the evaporative power of water bodies {{as a tool to}} limit the urban heat island effect (UHI) and undesirable human thermal comfort. Based on weather observations by Dutch hobby meteorologists and a station network in Rotterdam (Netherlands), we show that water bodies increase rather than decrease the 95 percentile of the daily maximum UHI. The high heat capacity of water suppresses the diurnal and annual cycle over water, and water temperatures remain relatively high after evening and season transitions. This is reflected to the 2 m temperature above and in the surround of the water body, and in a relatively high UHI.

40|$|Effects of {{tree species}} {{diversity}} on decomposition can operate via {{a multitude of}} mechanism, including alterations of microclimate by the forest canopy. Studying such effects in natural settings {{is complicated by the}} fact that topography also affects microclimate and thus decomposition, so that effects of diversity are more difficult to isolate. Here, we quantified decomposition rates of standard litter in young subtropical forest stands, separating effects of canopy tree species richness and topography, and quantifying their direct and micro-climate-mediated components. Our litterbag study was carried out at two experimental sites of a biodiversity-ecosystem functioning field experiment in south-east China (BEF-China). The field sites display strong topographical heterogeneity and were planted with tree communities ranging from monocultures to mixtures of 24 native subtropical tree species. Litter bags filled with senescent leaves of three native tree species were placed from Nov. 2011 to Oct. 2012 on 134 plots along the tree species diversity gradient. Topographic features were measured for all and microclimate in a subset of plots. Stand species richness, topography and microclimate explained important fractions of the variations in litter decomposition rates, with diversity and topographic effects in part mediated by microclimatic changes. Tree stands were 2 - 3 years old, but nevertheless tree species diversity explained more variation (54. 3 %) in decomposition than topography (7. 7 %). Tree species richness slowed litter decomposition, an effect that slightly depended on litter species identity. A large part of the variance in decomposition was explained by tree species composition, with the presence of three tree species playing a significant role. Microclimate explained 31. 4 % of the variance in decomposition, and was related to lower soil moisture. Within this <b>microclimate</b> <b>effect,</b> species diversity (without composition) explained 8. 9 % and topography 34. 4 % of variance.

40|$|To place current {{climate change}} in context, it is {{necessary}} to study geologic proxy records that extend beyond historical documentation. One such proxy is polar ice cores, which contain climatic information many thousands of years into the past. In East Antarctica, a ~ 700, 000 year ice core record shows that Earth climate has shifted between glacial (cold) and inter-glacial (warm) conditions seven times, mirrored by atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. In Greenland, ~ 100, 000 year ice core records show that climate has changed abruptly within years to decades. These long-term and short-term changes frame our understanding of the climate system, and allow for informed predictions about future climate change. In this dissertation, we study a number of ice core records from West Antarctica. We first present a series of seven shallow ice cores from Siple Dome, West Antarctica. The shallow cores are used to investigate high-frequency variability in water isotopes (a proxy for local temperature and regional atmospheric circulation). Although the shallow cores span only 60 km, a <b>microclimate</b> <b>effect</b> causes distinct differences across the dome - an effect that should be considered in the interpretations of longer ice cores taken from coastal West Antarctic locations. We then shift focus to the analysis of an ultra-high resolution water isotope record from the inland West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core (WDC). This record was analyzed using laser absorption spectroscopy, consists of over 24 million data points, and extends to 68, 000 years before present. It is the highest-resolution and longest continuous ice core climate record ever recovered from Antarctica. A number of analyses are performed, including: 1) Quantification of diffusional processes, 2) Reconstruction of high-frequency decadal and sub-decadal oscillations, and 3) Analysis of low-frequency millennial-scale oscillations. The results of the WDC water isotope study hold important insight into Antarctic climate patterns. The annual signal is found to trend with solar insolation over the last 10 thousand years. The strength of 2 to 15 -year variability - which may originate as part of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the tropical Pacific Ocean - exhibits distinct differences between the most recent glacial and interglacial periods. At the millennial-scale, variability appears to be partially driven by solar activity. A regular oscillation (of solar origin or otherwise) is evident in the water isotope record for the last 68 thousand years, and may hold clues to the initiation of abrupt climate change events documented in Greenland ice cores. Ultimately, the resolution of the WDC record allows for the assessment of climate change on the order of a presidential term (4 years) or less over most of the last glacial-interglacial cycle. More importantly, the results provide context for current and future anthropogenic climate change by defining natural variability in the past...|$|E
40|$|Microclimate {{has been}} known to drive {{variation}} in the distribution and abundance of insects for some time. Until recently however, quantification of microclimatic effects has been limited by computing constraints and the availability of fine-scale biological data. Here, we tested fine-scale patterns of persistence/extinction in butterflies and moths against two computed indices of microclimate derived from Digital Elevation Models: a summer solar index, representing fine-scale variation in temperature, and a topographic wetness index, representing fine-scale variation in moisture availability. We found evidence of <b>microclimate</b> <b>effects</b> on persistence in each of four 20 × 20 km British landscapes selected for study (the Brecks, the Broads, Dartmoor, and Exmoor). Broadly, local extinctions occurred more frequently in areas with higher minimum or maximum solar radiation input, while responses to wetness varied with landscape context. This negative response to solar radiation is consistent with a response to climatic warming, wherein grid squares with particularly high minimum or maximum insolation values provided an increasingly adverse microclimate as the climate warmed. The variable response to wetness in different landscapes may have reflected spatially variable trends in precipitation. We suggest that locations in the landscape featuring cooler minimum and/or maximum temperatures could act as refugia from climatic warming, and may therefore have a valuable role in adapting conservation to climatic change...|$|R

40|$|Aims : Because {{the water}} status of grapevines {{strongly}} affects {{the quality of}} the grapes and resulting wine, automated and early drought stress detection is important. Plant measurements are very promising for detecting drought stress, but strongly depend on microclimatic changes. Therefore, conventional stress detection methods require threshold values which define when plants start sensing drought stress. There is however no unique method to define these values. In this study, we propose two techniques that overcome this limitation. Methods : Two statistical methods were used to automatically distinguish between drought and <b>microclimate</b> <b>effects,</b> based on a short preceding full-irrigated period to extract plant behaviour under normal conditions: Unfold Principal Component Analysis (UPCA) and Functional Unfold Principal Component Analysis (FUPCA). Both techniques aimed at detecting when measured sap flow rate or stem diameter variations in grapevine deviated from their normal behaviour due to drought stress. Results : The models based on sap flow rate had some difficulties to detect stress on days with low atmospheric demands, while those based on stem diameter variations did not show this limitation, but ceased detecting stress when the stem diameter levelled off after a period of severe shrinkage. Nevertheless, stress was successfully detected with both approaches days before visible symptoms appeared. Conclusions : UPCA and FUPCA based on plant indicators are therefore very promising for early stress detection...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{conducting}} real-time bridge deformation monitoring is {{addressed in the}} context of the development of bridge management system (BMS) and land transportation safety in this thesis. Current instruments used for bridge dynamic deformation monitoring are compared in terms of system productivity and reliability. An integrated sensor system of Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and triaxial accelerometer is then proposed with the capabilities to accurately monitor long-term deformation and short-term dynamics of a bridge. Since the investigation of the bridge dynamic responses is of great importance in research and practice, the emphasis of this thesis is on the monitoring of dynamic bridge deformation. Zero baseline (ZBL) and short baseline (SBL) tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of three types of Leica GPS receivers at 10 Hz sampling rate. Statistic characteristics of positioning solutions and the achievable accuracy of each receiver type are analysed, which are employed to design optimal filters for various GPS error suppressions. By using a moving average (MA) technique, millimetre baseline accuracy can be achieved even with a single frequency receiver. It demonstrates the possibilities to conduct millimetre bridge deformation monitoring if appropriate filtering techniques are applied to the positioning solutions and integer ambiguity has been fixed. A simple but accurate triaxial accelerometer calibration technique is proposed in the thesis with a solid mathematical derivative to evaluate the precisions of estimated parameter offsets. A specially designed cage is used to house a GPS antenna with a triaxial accelerometer to avoid complex sensor alignment and simplify the coordinate transformations between different reference frames. The determination of instantaneous attitude of an accelerometer body frame is realised by three GPS stations on the deck of a bridge at a rate of 10 Hz and the sensed 3 D accelerations are then transformed into a bridge coordinate system (BCS) simultaneously. BCS is the computation frame of a hybrid bridge deformation monitoring system (BDMS). Important issues in sensor integration such as local gravity determination, synchronisation of time series from different sensors are addressed. Bridge trials are briefed with the emphasis on the instrument configuration for effective error mitigation and sensor integration. A group of reference stations consisting of two reference stations closely setup near a bridge and the permanent continuous GPS stations are recommended for reducing relative tropospheric delay, multipath, and receiver noise both at reference stations and monitoring sites. GPS satellite sky distribution and its impact on propagating ranging errors in mid latitude areas such as in the UK and high latitude areas are analysed both with analytical and simulation approaches. The error propagation formulae are derived to analyse the defects of current satellite constellation on the GPS positioning solutions in each direction of a BCS. This is further exploited to improve the component accuracy of particular interest through changing the dilution of precision (DOP) values. The degree of positioning improvement is illustrated with GPS/GLONASS positioning. A simulator according to ranging error propagation is used to simulate the achievable accuracy from the best and the worst GPS constellations. Modified precise satellite ephemeris by inserting the positions of pseudolites is employed to investigate the changes of DOP values in each direction of a BCS. The summaries of this simulation have universe significance in guiding the selection of the best locations of pseudolites. Adaptive Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering or adaptive filtering (AF) for short and important application issues are addressed in the thesis. Autocorrelation lags of ZBL and SBL tests of each type of receiver are used to determine the filter lengths according to the fundamentals of low pass and high pass filter designs. A real-time AF algorithm is introduced and widely employed as an analytical tool in the error mitigation and real bridge deformation signal extraction. The application defects of MA technique in bridge deformation monitoring are compared with AF approach according to the component analysis of GPS positioning solutions. A recursive AF algorithm is proposed to gradually isolate actual bridge deflection signals from multipath and receiver noise both at reference stations and monitoring sites. Spectral analysis is applied to the input and output signals to investigate the efficiency of the designed filter. In order to effectively isolate actual bridge deformation, misalignment and its consequence are demonstrated with day-to-day shifted time series of bridge deflection. Cross-correlation is also used to analyse the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed AF algorithm. Acceleration aided AF approach is detailed in the thesis. A simple algorithm, based on the principles of digital signal filtering and optimal filter design, is proposed to estimate relative displacements of bridge sensed by a triaxial accelerometer in three dimensions. With the relative displacements, GPS receiver noise has been filtered out and the cleaned displacements are obtained. AS another data fusion approach, a software package based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to integrate GPS and accelerometer data with a position output rate up to that of a triaxial accelerometer is introduced. Relative tropospheric delay is another major error source identified in GPS-based bridge deformation monitoring. Methods applied to distinguish the impacts of multipath and tropospheric delay are presented. The cause for relative tropospheric delay is analysed and <b>microclimate</b> <b>effect</b> is recognised as the major impact factor in this particular environment. Numerical calculations also confirm the assumption. The way to effectively remove relative tropospheric delay is recommended. The research emphasis in this thesis is to develop a prototype of a hybrid BDMS to achieve centimetre level positioning accuracy at each epoch in three dimension of a BCS. The findings from this research are summarised and the future work is predicted...|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{population}} growth are driving an ever increasing need to conserve water in Utah. One way to accomplish this is xeriscaping, which typically involves changing landscapes to utilize surfaces and materials that use less water. However, there can be tradeoffs that result from this type of water conservation, particularly the amplification of the Urban Heat Island effect. Compared with turf, xeriscaped surfaces absorb more sunlight (have a lower albedo) and use more of the absorbed energy for sensible heat (raising the temperature) than for latent heat (evaporating water without raising the temperature). Thus, turf may {{need a lot of}} water in order to grow, but evaporation of that water helps cool the surface. For these reasons, xeriscaping has the potential to raise temperatures when implemented on a large scale. Research was undertaken at Weber State University’s Ogden campus to investigate the <b>microclimate</b> <b>effects</b> of different surface types. A turf surface and a xeriscape surface were chosen, roughly 100 m apart {{on the west side of}} Elizabeth Hall. The two locations have similar weather exposures, such as solar radiation and shade, leaving surface characteristics as the main difference. Equal air and ground temperature measurements for the two surfaces were taken during the course of a two-month period. The data collected and recorded shows the xeriscape surface produces significantly higher temperatures compared with turf. These results clearly show the tradeoffs of water conservation, and indicate the possible consequences of large-scale xeriscaping at Weber State University’s Ogden campus...|$|R

We examined water relations in dominant Banksia menziesii R. Br. trees using magnetic leaf patch clamp pressure (ZIM-) probes that allow continuous, real-time monitoring of leaf water status. Multiple ZIM-probes across the crown were complemented by traditional ecophysiological measurements. During summer, early stomatal downregulation of transpiration prevented midday balancing pressures from exceeding 2. 5 MPa. Diurnal patterns of ZIM-probe and pressure chamber readings agreed reasonably well, however, ZIM-probes recorded short-term dynamics, which are impossible to capture using a pressure chamber. Simultaneous recordings of three ZIM-probes evenly spaced along leaf laminas revealed intrafoliar turgor gradients, which, however, did not develop in a strictly basi- or acropetal fashion and varied with cardinal direction. Drought stress manifested as increasing daily signal amplitude (low leaf water status) and occasionally as rising baseline at night (delayed rehydration). These symptoms occurred more often locally than across the entire crown. <b>Microclimate</b> <b>effects</b> on leaf water status were strongest in crown regions experiencing peak morning radiation (East and North).

40|$|Urbanization is {{responsible}} {{for some of the}} fastest rates of land-use change around the world, with important consequences for local, regional, and global climate. Vegetation, which represents a significant proportion of many urban and suburban landscapes, can modify climate by altering local exchanges of heat, water vapor, and CO 2. To determine how distinct urban forest communities vary in their <b>microclimate</b> <b>effects</b> over time, we measured stand-level leaf area index, soil temperature, infrared surface temperature, and soil water content over a complete growing season at 29 sites representing the five most common vegetation types in a suburban neighborhood of Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota. We found that seasonal patterns of soil and surface temperatures were controlled more by differences in stand-level leaf area index and tree cover than by plant functional type. Across the growing season, sites with high leaf area index had soil temperatures that were 7 °C lower and surface temperatures that were 6 °C lower than sites with low leaf area index. Site differences in mid-season soil temperature and turfgrass ground cover were best explained by leaf area index, whereas differences in mid-season surface temperature were best explained by percent tree cover. The significant cooling effects of urban tree canopies on soil temperature imply that seasonal changes in leaf area index may also modulate CO 2 efflux from urban soils, a highly temperature-dependent process, and that this should be considered in calculations of total CO 2 efflux for urban carbon budgets. Field-based estimates of percent tree cover were found to better predict mid-season leaf area index than satellite-derived estimates and consequently offer an approach to scale up urban biophysical properties...|$|R

40|$|Northwestern Baja California {{is an area}} of {{exceptionally}} high local endemism, nestled at {{the southernmost}} end of the California Floristic Province (CFP), one of the world's mediterranean-climate regions. The ecotonal position between the CFP and the central deserts of the Baja California Peninsula reflects the transition of the major climatic regimes. This area appears to have been more climatically stable than adjacent areas, and the local endemism along the coast is largely the result of the persistent marine layer, which buffers temperature extremes and maintains moisture during the drier months of the year. The driving hypothesis of this dissertation is that long-term climatic stability provided by the cold coastal upwelling of the California Current (driven in turn by the large-scale circulation of the seas) has buffered climatic conditions along the coast, reducing species extinctions and allowing adaptive processes leading to high levels of endemism in the local flora. The high productivity of the coastal upwelling has also had an impact on local plant diversity through the impact of prehistoric shell middens on soil heterogeneity: Ocean deposits (aragonite shells) extracted by indigenous people have added to landscape complexity and increased biological diversity along the coast. Shell middens are scattered along the coast, and idiosyncratically change soil conditions and the resultant plant communities. Shell middens consistently increase native plant diversity, but with very different species compositions, overlapping conservation priorities for archeology and biodiversity. The climate-buffering effect of the coastal currents can be evaluated in the flowering dynamics of the local plant communities: Plant phenology is predominantly controlled by season and available moisture. Fogs dampen seasonality in flowering times and plants flower for longer time periods at the coast, allowing probable mechanisms for speciation. This stability is consistent with the high levels of endemism that can be seen along the coast, and in <b>microclimate</b> <b>effects</b> on phenology along the inland-to-coast gradient. Conservation of coastal habitats in this southern edge of the California Floristic Province is of elevated importance due to the refugium effect of the marine layer, and the presence of archeological sites that increase biodiversity...|$|R

Urbanization {{is responsible}} {{for some of the}} fastest rates of land-use change around the world, with important consequences for local, regional, and global climate. Vegetation can represent a significant proportion of many urban and suburban landscapes and modifies climate by altering local exchanges of heat, water vapor, and CO 2. To assess the contribution of plant functional types to urban ecosystem processes of water loss and carbon gain in a suburban neighborhood of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA, I investigated 1) the <b>microclimate</b> <b>effects</b> of different forest types over time, 2) the relative importance of environmental and biological controls on urban tree transpiration and canopy photosynthesis, and 3) the relative importance of trees and turfgrass on the spatial and seasonal variation in suburban evapotranspiration. Regardless of plant functional type, I found that seasonal patterns of soil and surface temperature were controlled by differences in stand-level leaf area index, and that sites with high leaf area index had soil and surface temperatures 7 °C and 6 °C lower, respectively, than sites with low leaf area index. Plant functional type differences in canopy structure and growing season length largely explained why evergreen needleleaf trees had significantly higher annual transpiration (307 kg H 2 O m- 2 yr- 1) and canopy photosynthesis (1. 02 kg C m- 2 yr- 1) rates per unit canopy area than deciduous broadleaf trees (153 kg H 2 O m- 2 yr- 1 and 0. 38 kg C m- 2 yr- 1, respectively), offering an approach to scale up the tree component of urban water and carbon budgets. Turfgrass represented the largest contribution to annual evapotranspiration in recreational and residential land-use types (87 % and 64 %, respectively), due to a higher fractional cover and greater daily water use than trees. Component-based estimates of suburban evapotranspiration underestimated measured water vapor fluxes by 3 %, providing a useful approach to predict the seasonal patterns of evapotranspiration in cities. These finding have implications for the management of urban ecosystem services related to climate, carbon sequestration, and hydrology, and for predicting the impacts of climate change on urban ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the use of}} passive greenhouse apparatus in field experiments investigating the biological consequences of climate change. The literature contains many accounts of such experiments claiming relevance of greenhouse treatment effects to global change scenarios. However, inadequacies in microclimate monitoring, together with incomplete understanding of greenhouse modes of action, cast doubt upon such claims. Here, treatment effects upon temperature (magnitude, range, variation, rates of change), moisture (humidity, precipitation, soil water content), light (intensity, spectral distribution), gas composition, snow cover, and wind speed are reviewed {{in the context of}} Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predictions. It is revealed that greenhouses modify each of these potentially limiting factors in a complex and interactive manner, but that the relationship between this modification and forecast conditions of climate change is poor. Interpretation of biological responses, and their extrapolation to predictive models, is thus unreliable. In order that future greenhouse experiments may overcome criticisms of artefact and lack of rigour, two amendments to methodology are proposed: (1) objective-orientated design of greenhouse apparatus (2) multiple controls addressing individual environmental factors. The importance of a priori testing of <b>microclimate</b> treatment <b>effects</b> is stressed...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{potential}} {{problems that can}} limit the success of revegetation efforts (Close & Davidson 2002; Close et al. 2007), many products available for revegetation, and little independent research on the efficacy of those products. For example tree guards are commonly used to establish native woody plants in ecological restoration projects yet the effectiveness of tree guards in promoting seedling establishment is uncertain (Lai & Wong 2005; Close et al. 2007). Tree guards may protect seedlings from vertebrate herbivores, and/or protect seedlings from desiccating hot wind and/or frost (Corr 2003; Gould 2005). In Aldinga, South Australia the summers are hot and dry {{and it is possible}} that tree guards could aggravate this heat stress (Close et al. 2007). However, due to the Mediterranean climate, winters are cold and tree guards may be beneficial because they limit seedling exposure to cold stress during the early establishment phase.

40|$|The {{interest}} in the various effects of environmental conservation which the plant and the green posses in urban area has been rising in recent years. The study on these effects of environmental conservation and the function began in the 1970 s and has become lively lately. However, it isn't enough for those study {{to contribute to the}} synthetic green openspace consolidation. Since, many cases study concerned about the independent function and the effect, and there are few cases from the viewpoint of distance dimension. This study tries to analyze the effects of environmental conservation in detail which the various green open space existed in urban area keeps through the human behavioral approach. From the analysis results, it makes clear from the existing effect which is brought about by the existing of the green open space and the utilizing effect which is brought about using it. It carried forward an analysis from the viewpoint of distance dimension and the effect area is determined. This study aimed at searching a developing plan for the synthetic green open space consolidation in the future in the daily living area from the study results. The knowledge which was gotten by this study is as follows. 1) On the existence effect, the natural environment supplying effect and the landscape effect are high and the <b>microclimate</b> control <b>effect</b> is low for the 4 types of green open space which are the old tomb, the agricultural land, the reservoir and the block park. According to the effect, on the natural environment supplying effect, the agricultural land is the highest and the old tomb is the next highest. On the landscape effect, the old tomb, the agricultural land and the reservoir which has 2 ha wood are high. Especially, the effect at the high surface of the water view reservoir is the highest. On the <b>microclimate</b> control <b>effect,</b> the area where about 40 percent rice paddy are accumulated in the ratio of green coverage in the area is the highest. The effect is mean at the old tomb with the area of fields existed dispersely and reservoir with woods around it. The effect is low for the block park and the reservoir without woods. 2) On the utilizing effect, the larger the scale of the green abundant park is, the better the effect it has in both cases of the disaster and daily use, and vice versa the smaller the scale, the worse the effect. 3) The range of the existing effect is described using the high effective area that equal to or more than 80 % of examinees notice an effect. The range of the landscape effect is the widest. The natural environment supplying <b>effect</b> and the <b>microclimate</b> control <b>effect</b> are also wide. The effect area of old tomb and the reservoir which has total large green open space and 2 ha woods on the landscape effect is wide with the range of 500 m. The range is the 200 m width for the 1 ha large block park. On the natural environment supplying effect, the old tomb with high visibility and with the reservoir and the woods over 2 ha as its neighbor is wide with the range of 500 m. For the reservoir with 1 ha woods, the 1 ha large block park and the block park which has the high ratio of green coverage result in the wide range of 300 - 400 m. The range of the <b>microclimate</b> control <b>effect</b> is very narrow. For the old tomb and the reservoir with the high percentage of {{the surface of the water}} and with wood of 2 ha or more which the high effective area is only occurred here. The rice field area keeps a high effective area on all existing effects and in all cases all the area could be set with the range of 100 m. 4) As for the range of the utilizing effect, the range is 200 m for the block park with a area over 2, 500 m^ 2 and high ratio of green coverage. For the block park with an area of about 1 ha or same as and the neighborhood park in same level, it is spreading to the range of 300 m. For the block parks with the low standard and low ratio of green coverage the effective range becomes narrow with the range of 100 m. It becomes clear that the utilizing range tends to shift to the rear area at the park in relation to the direction of the line of flow to the daily living base. It is clarified that the range is limited by the cutting-off element near the railway and the high standard road. 5) In order to plot synthetic green open space consolidation in the daily living area through the model of the effective area resulted from the case study, the important point concluded is as follows: It is important to consolidate the green open space from the type which is used as a facility to the type with variety which is emphasized on the naturalness,. to allocate the different kinds of green open space from the viewpoint of the existing effect for these types with special utilizing effect, and to conserve the regional natural resources such as the agricultural land, the reservoir, old tomb etc. It is also very important to create the new space with water and green open space as a whole...|$|R

The focus was on four microclimate parameters which are land surface albedo, land surface temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure. This study showed a clear impact when land cover changes to solar panel. In fact, the solar panel’s albedo in the shortwave part of Electro Magnetic Spectrum (EMS) is around 0. 13, compared to the dominant landcover class in arid area, sand which is 0. 30. Furthermore, by implementing solar panels over a vast arid area, the surface temperature might increase by 20 – 30 % passing from an average of 45 °C to 62 °C. Thus, the relative humidity in the time of image has dropped from 13 % standardize to only 3 % in the case of solar panels.

40|$|The {{excess heat}} that {{is stored in}} urban {{materials}} and created by human activities implies that people living in cities are particularly vulnerable to heat stress and heat related illness. In Australia, where extreme weather and prolonged drought are common, heat exposure in urban areas can be significantly exacerbated. The combination of increasing urban development, excessive urban heating, and lower water availability, alongside the impacts of future climate change could have damaging implications for the human {{health and well-being of}} urban dwellers. Water management in cities {{plays an important role in}} determining urban climates, but minimal work has been done that directly acknowledges these interconnected issues. Integrated water management approaches, such as water sensitive urban design (WSUD), provide a means for retaining water in the urban environment through stormwater harvesting and reuse. This study examines the potential for WSUD to provide cooling benefits and reduce human exposure to heat stress and thermal discomfort. A high resolution observational field campaign, measuring surface level microclimate variables and remotely sensed land surface characteristics, was conducted in a mixed residential suburb containing WSUD in Adelaide, South Australia. At Mawson Lakes microclimate variability was measured, including air temperature and thermal comfort, to investigate the <b>microclimate</b> <b>effects</b> of WSUD features, including man-made lakes, bio-filtration wetlands, and irrigated open space. Additionally, the SURFEX (SURFace EXternalisée in French) model was used to simulate the potential for irrigation to reduce exposure to heat stress and provide more thermally comfortable conditions during heatwaves. Clear evidence was found that WSUD approaches and irrigation can provide cooler air temperature and more comfortable thermal urban environments. It was found that the microclimate conditions that people experience in Mawson Lakes vary significantly over small spatial scales. The effects of WSUD features were seen to be highly localised, having little effect beyond 50 m from the source. Air temperature variability was influenced by land surface differences, such as proximity to water bodies. Sites that there were influenced by water bodies were up to 1. 8 °C cooler during the day. However, human thermal comfort (HTC) was less influenced by land surface characteristics, and was mostly determined by contrasts in shading and airflow in the environment. The modelling analysis showed that there is high potential for irrigation to cool air temperature during heatwave conditions; with irrigation a 2. 8 °C maximum reduction in daily average temperature was predicted. From this research some specific recommendations for the implementation of WSUD have been developed. These include consideration of the local wind regime when implementing WSUD; the use of smaller distributed features throughout the urban landscape at targeted locations; the use of irrigation during heatwaves to provide cooling; and the retention of trees in urban areas to provide shade, and augment the thermal comfort benefits provided by WSUD features. Overall, this research argues that distributed WSUD features can be used to capture, store, and treat stormwater, simultaneously providing ecological benefits and thermal benefits. Further, harvested stormwater can be re-integrated into the urban environment, thereby helping to maintain vegetation and providing distributed evaporative cooling benefits...|$|R

40|$|QuestionIn {{temperate}} agroforestry systems, soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) stocks are generally increased [1], but is difficultto disentangle the different factors {{responsible for this}} SOC storage. Organic carbon (OC) inputs to soil may belarger, but SOC decomposition rates may also be modified owing to physical protection, <b>microclimate,</b> orpriming <b>effect</b> from tree roots. Our objective was therefore to assess if organic inputs could be the main driverof SOC storage in agroforestry systems. MethodsThis study was performed in an 18 -year-old silvoarable system associating hybrid walnut trees and durumwheat, and in an adjacent agricultural control plot. SOC stocks and all OC inputs to the soil, i. e., leaf litter, treefine root senescence [2, 3], crop residues, and tree row herbaceous vegetation were quantified down 2 mdepth [4]. We then adapted a model [5] to simulate SOC dynamics in agroforestry accounting for both thewhole soil profile and the lateral spatial heterogeneity. ResultsMeasured OC inputs to soil were increased by about 40 % (+ 1. 11 t C ha- 1 yr- 1) down 2 m depth in theagroforestry plot compared to the control, resulting in an additional SOC stock of 6. 3 t C ha- 1 down to 1 mdepth (Fig. 1). The model described properly the measured SOC stocks and distribution with depth, especiallywhen priming effect was taken into account (Fig. 2). ConclusionsModeling showed that the observed SOC storage in an agroforestry system would result from increased OCinputs, which were measured, and from an acceleration of SOC decomposition. This compensatory mechanismcould reduce a lot the potential of agroforestry soils to store SOC, especially at depth. Deep-rooted treesmodify OC inputs to soil, a process that deserves further studies given its potential effects on SOC dynamics...|$|R
