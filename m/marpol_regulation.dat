5000|$|A marine LNG {{engine is}} a {{dual fuel engine}} that uses natural gas and bunker fuel to convert {{chemical}} energy in to mechanical energy. Due to natural gas’ cleaner burning properties, the use of natural gas in merchant ship propulsion plants is becoming an option for companies in order to comply with IMO and <b>MARPOL</b> environmental <b>regulations.</b> The natural gas is stored in liquid state (LNG) and the boil-off gas is routed to and burned in dual fuel engines. [...] Shipping companies have been cautious when choosing a propulsion system for their fleets. The steam turbine system has been the main choice as the prime mover on LNG carriers {{over the last several}} decades. The decades old system on steam propelled LNG carriers uses BOG (boil-off gas). LNG carriers are heavily insulated to keep the LNG at around -160 °C - to keep it liquefied. What happens is that even with all the insulation, the LNG containment area is penetrated by heat which allows for naturally generated boil-off gas (BOG).|$|R

40|$|With the {{amendments}} to the <b>MARPOL</b> Annex VI <b>regulations</b> to control NOx and SOx emissions, fuel prices will increase considerably by 2020. Coupled with depleting fossil fuel reserves and owners’ perceptions on their environmental impact, fossil fuel alternatives are being actively sought. The IMarEST reports that nuclear power is the only emissions free energy which can replace fossil fuels entirely (Jenkins, 2011).

The paper will present the work to date on the concept analysis and how the issue with route restrictions is being addressed by designing a modular vessel consisting of a propulsion module and a cargo module which can decouple outside of territorial waters. A service factor analysis with hydroelasticity models will provide the long term bending moments and the modular coupling concept assessment in open waters for unrestricted service. Accidents will be addressed using risk based design focussing on grounding and collisions in restricted waters using probabilistic model...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: IMO <b>MARPOL</b> Annex VI <b>regulation</b> {{has been}} set for global {{application}} to reduce {{the negative consequences of}} ship gas emissions SOx, NOx, and CO 2. To enforce the regulation, real time gas emission monitoring system is in need. The system in this paper consists of a microcontroller, gas analyz-ers, sensors and Xbee radio module. The data acquired from the sensors and gas analyzer is transmitted using a microcontroller over the Xbee module to the receiver Xbee module on the main microcontroller for real-time compliance check. Real time monitoring system expedites the checks by officials in enforcing the regulation. Ultimately, this application enables engine manufacturers, ship-owners and Administra-tions to ensure in real time that all applicable marine diesel engines are in compliance with the limiting values determined by IMO MARPOL Annex VI. This paper offers the solution of the lack of technology mentioned above. Important param-eters for compliance are measured by sensors that give electrical signal output of various types. After that, the data value from the sensors is collected by the microcontroller (data acquisition system). The microcontroller processes the data calculation and output the value useful for end-user such as SOx, NOx and CO 2 emission. This end-user data is stored in the local memory of the microcontrol-ler. Thereafter, the end-user data is transmitted through the Xbee to the receiver Xbee on the main microcontroller. This end-user data obtained by the main microcontroller is then stored and used...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the conference}} is to {{highlight}} how {{the results of the}} international research and development can contribute to finding a solution to the current crisis that the shipbuilding industry, and in particular the European Union, are facing in recent years. Innovation can be of great help to overcome the current critical moment. On the other hand new requirements relating to the protection of environmental values impose new requirements on designers and builders of ships and onboard systems. The amendments to <b>MARPOL</b> Annex VI <b>Regulations</b> for the prevention of air pollution from ships, which entered into force on 1 January 2013, add a new Chapter 4 to Annex VI to make mandatory the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for new ships, and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEE MP) for all ships. From this point of view, the choice of Lecco as NAV 2015 location represents a clear reference to sustainability, because Lecco is just a few kilometres from Milan, the city selected to host, in the same period of NAV 2015 Conference, the great event of Expo Milano 2015. it is the first universal exposition in history to be remembered for its contribution towards education on food and the precious resources of our planet. As well as Expo 2015 is focused on food sustainability, NAV 2015 edition is characterized by meaningful papers and workshops on ship energy saving, fisheries and aquaculture, and more broadly on maritime sustainability.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this case}} study {{is to find the}} most {{cost-effective}} strategy for complying with the IMO s <b>MARPOL</b> Convention <b>Regulation</b> 13 & 14 in the Baltic Sea Emission Control Areas (ECAs) in the period from 2015 to 2035. The alternative compliance strategies considered are:- Scenario 0 : Use Marine Gas Oil (MGO with 0. 1 % sulphur) to comply with the sulphur requirements, no other abatement measures installed, but an assumed NOx-taxation applies;- Scenario 1 : Use Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO with 2. 7 % sulphur) and add scrubber and SCR to reduce SOx and NOx emissions, respectively;- Scenario 2 : Use Marine Gas Oil (MGO with 0. 1 % sulphur) together with an SCR; and- Scenario 3 : Use Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), single fuel or dual fuel. The following route is established: Helsinki Zeebrugge Antwerp St. Petersburg Kotka Helsinki. The total distance for the roundtrip is 3654 nm. 48 roundtrips are completed every year. Based on the specific fuel consumption for the engine and the sulphur content in the fuel, the sulphur emission factor for each scenario is calculated. The amount of SOx emitted from the ship is found by summarizing the product of the engine load, the engine size, the ship s estimated time at sea and the emission factor. The NOx emission limits for the ship engines in relation to their rated engine speed given in revolutions per minute. The NOx emission factor is assumed to be constant at 55 kg NOx per ton fuel. Investment analyses are performed for a ship type both as new builds and as retrofitted. Operational costs include: fuel costs, lubricating oil costs, maintenance and repair/replacement costs, environmental taxation and educational costs (where applicable), among others. Scenario 0 is chosen as reference point {{based on the fact that}} it has the lowest investment cost among the scenarios. The cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) relative Scenario 0 is found from the following formula:CER[EUR/tons]=(Differences in PVC between Scenario 0 and Scenario X) /(Differences in emissions between Scenario 0 and Scenario X) =&# 8710;PVC/&# 8710;EThe following conclusions are drawn from the cost-effectiveness analysis: - The scrubber in combination with SCR is a favored compliance strategy for IMO s requirements, both for new builds and retrofits. It has the lowest fuel costs (HFO prices are low and stable) and the lowest present value of total costs among the scenarios outlined. - Having an engine running on MGO is not considered cost-effective. MGO prices are high, and are expected to increase even more. NOx abatement technologies are needed in addition. - LNG is a cost-effective solution, and it is the most environmental friendly alternative. Retrofitting vessels to run on LNG, however, is expensive. The LNG dual fuel technology is a flexible solution, and makes it more economic for the ship to trade outside the ECAs. - The cost comparison between the different scenarios depends largely on the future development of fuel prices. - Modal shift to either rail or road could be a consequence...|$|R
40|$|Maritime {{transport}} {{accounts for}} about 80 % of all commercial cargo transport. The maritime sector is a large emitter of greenhouse gases, sulphur oxides, and nitrogen oxides. Since 1997, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) set <b>regulations</b> (<b>Marpol</b> Annex VI) requiring maritime transport vessels to reduce exhaust emissions. Today vessels are required to fulfil stringent emission targets for SO 2 (Regulation 14 in Annex VI) and for NOx (Regulation 13). A common method of reducing SO 2 emissions is by absorption of exhaust gases derived from the marine diesel engine, through wet scrubbing while NOx is commonly reduced by SCR. Studies have shown that, under certain pH conditions and exhaust gas compositions, SO 2 and NO 2 can react in liquid phase to form stable compounds The objective of this work is to investigate a process for simultaneous absorption of SO 2 and NO 2. A steady-state simulation model is constructed in Aspen Plus, of a scrubber developed by Yara Marine Technology, which utilises the surrounding seawater in order to efficiently scrub SO 2 from exhaust gases. The simulation was performed in a packed RateSep model, with two configurations: one open loop (once-through liquid stream) model, and one closed loop (recycled liquid stream) model. Parameter data from a real life case is used to construct the model, and operational data from the absorber is used to verify the model. The {{results show that the}} process removes NOx efficiently from the flue gas stream. There is also an overall improvement of the SO 2 removal compared to today’s process. In open loop configuration, the formation nitrogen and sulphur is mainly bound as HADS. In the closed loop configuration, due to the recirculation, there is a risk of N 2 O formation that must be considered. The oxidation of the NO present in the flue gas requires an oxidizing agent. The process would requires around 119 kg ClO 2 /h or 180 kg H 2 O 2 /h in order to oxidise all NO. In summary, there is a potential in utilising oxidation of NO to NO 2 combined with wet scrubbing in order to meet maritime regulations for both SO 2 and NOx emissions, which can compete with the current combination of SCR and wet SO 2 scrubbing...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFollowing the {{enforcement}} of <b>MARPOL</b> Annex VI <b>Regulations</b> for the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships, retrofitting conventional power plants with emerging technologies {{is seen as a}} means to promote sustainability of marine transport and comply with more stringent emissions legislation. However, a knowledge gap exists as the environmental performance of retrofit power plant solutions incorporating emerging technologies has not been examined using an integrated system approach based on Life Cycle Assessment. The purpose of this research was to investigate if integrating selected emerging technologies i. e. photovoltaic systems, lithium-ion batteries, cold ironing and power-take-off/power-take-in systems supplemented by frequency converters and variable frequency drives into an existing power plant would be to the advantage of a chosen ship type i. e. Roll-on/Roll-off cargo ships, from the perspectives of resource consumption and environmental burden. Using the power plant of an existing vessel as a case study, it was found that cast iron, steel, copper and aluminium were the four materials most commonly consumed during manufacturing phase i. e. 2. 9 × 105 kg, 1. 9 × 105 kg, 5. 3 × 104 kg and 2. 9 × 104 kg respectively. By burning 2. 9 × 107 kg of heavy fuel oil and 2. 3 × 108 kg of marine diesel oil during operation, 8. 2 × 108 kg of carbon dioxide, 1. 7 × 107 kg of nitrogen oxides, 6. 1 × 106 kg of sulphur dioxide, 7. 6 × 105 kg of carbon monoxide, 6. 5 × 105 kg of hydrocarbon and 4. 7 × 105 kg of particulate matter would be released. Over a projected 30 -year period, emissions released to air and freshwater were found to be significant. Based on 3 characterisation methodologies, ecotoxicity potential, with 7 – 10 orders of magnitude, was identified as the most significant environmental burden. Consuming and storing resources had the least impact, operating diesel engines and auxiliary generators had a moderate impact, and disposing metallic waste had the highest impact. The research concluded that the environmental burden caused by a marine power plant was significant but retrofitting existing power plant with suitable emerging technologies could reduce a number of impacts by 4 – 7 orders of magnitude, as verified via scenario analysis. However, the system should be designed and managed with due care as the environmental benefits, such as lower fuel consumption, emission reduction and performance improvement in some environmental measures are always achieved at the expense of an increase in other detrimental impacts...|$|R
