5|$|Despite being a {{continuous}} oval bowl, {{each side of}} the stadium is named {{in the manner of a}} traditional football ground. All sides were initially named by compass direction (North Stand and South Stand for the ends, East Stand and West Stand for the sides). In February 2004, after a vote by fans, the West Stand was renamed the Colin Bell Stand in honour of the former player. The vote was almost cancelled (and the stand instead named after Joe Mercer) due to suspicions it had been hijacked by rival fans who wished to dub the renamed stand The Bell End. However, core supporters of the club <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> still wished the stand named after their hero. The East Stand is unofficially known by fans as the Kippax as a tribute to the very vocal east stand at the club's Maine Road ground.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Pawlenty {{wanted to}} run for governor, but party leaders <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> favored {{businessman}} Brian Sullivan. Pawlenty then decided on the U.S. Senate, but he abandoned those plans when Vice President Dick Cheney asked him to step aside and allow former St. Paul mayor Norm Coleman to challenge Senator Paul Wellstone without Republican primary opposition. Pawlenty returned to his original ambition and won a hard-fought and narrow victory over Sullivan in the Republican party primary election.|$|E
25|$|Until 1972, {{containing}} the guerrillas {{was little more}} than a police action. Even as late as August 1975 when Rhodesian government and black nationalist leaders met at Victoria Falls for negotiations brokered by South Africa and Zambia, the talks never got beyond the procedural phase. Rhodesian representatives <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> were prepared to fight an all out war to prevent majority rule. However, the situation changed dramatically after the end of Portuguese colonial rule in Mozambique in 1975. Rhodesia now found itself almost entirely surrounded by hostile states and even South Africa, its only real ally, pressed for a settlement.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there was}} a narrow {{majority}} in the Cabinet for drastic reductions in spending, the minority included senior ministers such as Arthur Henderson who <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> would resign rather than acquiesce in the cuts. With this unworkable split, on 24 August 1931 MacDonald submitted his resignation and then agreed, on the urging of King George V to form a National Government with the Conservatives and Liberals. With Henderson taking the lead, MacDonald, Snowden, and Thomas were quickly expelled from the Labour Party. They responded by forming a new National Labour group, which provided a nominal party base for the expelled MPs but received little support in the country or the unions. Great anger in the labour movement greeted MacDonald's move. Riots took place in protest in Glasgow and Manchester. Many in the Labour Party viewed this as a cynical move by MacDonald to rescue his career, and accused him of 'betrayal'. MacDonald, however, argued that the sacrifice was for the common good.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, the {{two teams}} agreed to {{schedule}} a rematch for September 6, 2010. Deborah Yow stated that, [...] "The citizens of Maryland have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> want this game." [...] Alluding to the Navy athletic staff's perceived reticence, she added, [...] "We got past the Charlotte situation." [...] The delay in scheduling was attributed {{to the need for}} a three-way contract between Maryland, Navy, and the stadium tenants, the Baltimore Ravens. For this reason, a renewal as far off as 2014 was not seriously discussed. Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "I {{would like to see it}} as an annual game, but that's not for me to decide." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{began the}} 1997–98 season well, but {{struggled}} in November; though they beat Manchester United at Highbury without the suspended Dennis Bergkamp. This was their only league win throughout the month. Defeat {{at home to}} Blackburn Rovers left the club in sixth position before Christmas and seemingly out of contention for the title. Striker Ian Wright was booed off by supporters over his performance, which he responded to by criticising the crowd from the dressing room window. Wenger called for an urgent team meeting, where [...] "home truths were spoken, fingers pointed, players were geed up." [...] The squad dictated how the conversation went, which the senior defenders <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> wanted Vieira and Petit to provide cover.|$|E
50|$|In the 2007 yearly {{review and}} the September {{quarterly}} review, Digital Bros <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that <b>they</b> not only intended to replace The Legend of Mir 2 but also another MMORPG service they provided, the Myth of Soma.|$|R
50|$|Mass demonstrations {{took place}} {{for and against}} former elect President Morsi on 30 June 2013, marking the one-year anniversary of Mohamed Morsi's inauguration.

500|$|Braham and Walsh {{were taken}} {{across the border}} by train to Germany {{and sent to the}} Luftwaffe {{interrogation}} centre at Oberursel, near Frankfurt. Along the journey the train stopped because of air raids throughout the day and night. The German guards <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> had disdain for the British airmen. When civilians saw them in the carriages and the stations insults and death threats were shouted at them. Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Propaganda Minister, had painted all British and Allied airmen as [...] "terror flyers" [...] and his message resonated with civilians. At one point, a group of drunk German soldiers threatened them with bayonets and tried forcing their way into the carriage of the over-crowded train. Braham feared for his life but the situation was restored when a young SS officer shouted an order and put a stop to it.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} {{phase of the}} {{uprising}} the rebels seized control of small towns and villages. Đurišić fought alongside communist insurgents and led a successful attack on Berane. During the heaviest fighting he distinguished himself and {{emerged as one of}} the main commanders of the uprising. After nearly two days of house-to-house fighting to capture Berane, he was involved in negotiating the surrender of the surviving Italian troops. Following the Italian surrender, he objected to the instructions he received from the communists regarding the handling of Italian prisoners. During the uprising, Đurišić also fought against Drljević's forces. Following the Italians' removal from the Lim valley, Đurišić urged rebels to march on Rožaje and Kosovska Mitrovica and attack the Muslims and Albanians there, whom he considered [...] "anational". The leaders of the uprising <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> considered such an action unacceptable.|$|E
500|$|Pablo became {{embroiled in}} the 2006 Real Madrid presidential elections. José Antonio Camacho, the chosen coach of presidential {{candidate}} Juan Palacios, {{announced that the}} club would bring in José Antonio Reyes, Joaquín and Pablo to strengthen the team if he won the election, and that the deal for Pablo was already done. Palacios lost the election, so Pablo had to remain with Atlético. His agent spoke out in his defence, confirming that Pablo had not asked to leave Atlético, and the Palacios faction were {{taking advantage of a}} contractual clause allowing him to leave if an offer of €15m were received (the club claimed the figure was only a basis for negotiation). He also disingenuously suggested that joining the hated rival was no different from joining a big club abroad. Atlético coach Javier Aguirre <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> still wanted and needed [...] "the best centre-back in Spain", and the player apologised to the fans, insisting he wanted to stay at Atlético and admitting he had made a mistake in accepting Real's offer.|$|E
50|$|Her {{father had}} disapproved of the marriage, and Sartoris proved dissolute and a {{disappointment}} to his parents, who <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that <b>they</b> did not blame Nellie for the breakup. Sartoris died in 1893, leaving her a wealthy young widow.|$|R

2500|$|Evanescence was {{originally}} promoted in Christian stores. Later, the band <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> {{did not want}} to be considered part of the Christian rock genre. Terry Hemmings, CEO of Christian music distributor Provident, expressed puzzlement at the band's about-face, saying: [...] "They clearly understood the album would be sold in these [...] channels". After many Christian stores began to remove the band's music from their shelves, Wind-up Records chairman Alan Meltzer then issued a press release in April 2003 requesting formally that they do this. In 2006, Amy Lee told Billboard that she had opposed the [...] "Christian band" [...] identification from the beginning, calling it a [...] "Ben thing". Evanescence cite Pantera, Björk, Mozart, Danny Elfman, Tori Amos, Nirvana, Portishead, Nine Inch Nails, Garbage and Plumb as influences.|$|E

25|$|It is {{stated by}} the {{management}} {{that the vast}} majority of passengers do not care whether the trains are powered by steam or diesel locomotives.

2500|$|The {{middle class}} {{were the ones}} who fanned the flames of revolution. [...] They {{established}} the National Assembly and tried to pressure the aristocracy to spread their money evenly between the upper, middle and lower classes. On 10 June 1789 Abbé Sieyès moved that the Third Estate, now meeting as the Communes (English: [...] "Commons") proceed with verifying its own powers and invite the other two estates to take part, but not to wait for them. They proceeded to do so two days later, completing the process on 17 June. Then they voted a measure far more radical, declaring themselves the National Assembly, an assembly not of the Estates but of [...] "the People". They invited the other orders to join them, but <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> intended to conduct the nation's affairs with or without them.|$|E
2500|$|On March 25, 2014, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid {{indicated}} that United States Senate would {{vote on this}} bill on March 27, 2014, but only after amending it to include provisions that would put sanctions [...] "against anyone deemed by the president to have undermined Ukraine's security or independence, or to have engaged in corruption in Ukraine or Russia." [...] The Senate has been pursuing its own Ukraine aid bill, the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014 (S. 2124; 113th Congress), but that bill included changes to the International Monetary Fund that House Republicans had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> would not accept.

2500|$|In January 2009, Portsmouth {{chairman}} Peter Storrie revealed Defoe's {{intentions to}} leave the club in the near future. This came after joining the club only in the same transfer window of the previous year. It was reported that Defoe's former club Tottenham made a formal approach for the striker, but no agreement was reached; Spurs manager Harry Redknapp described the clubs as [...] "miles apart in their valuation of the player", suggesting that Portsmouth wanted [...] "in excess of £20million". After negotiations, Portsmouth accepted a bid from Tottenham thought to be around £15.75million (including fees owed to Tottenham for the previous transfers of Younès Kaboul and Pedro Mendes and waiving a £4million sell-on clause that had also been negotiated during his transfer from Spurs to Portsmouth) on 6 January 2009. The player had agreed to a five-year contract and was confirmed as a Tottenham player by his new club on 9 January 2009. Defoe was presented at White Hart Lane {{before the start of}} Spurs' League Cup clash against Burnley after Spurs fans <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> wanted the striker back at White Hart Lane.|$|E

ECOWAS gave the interim government one year to hold elections.|$|R
2500|$|Five {{seasons in}} the Second Division followed. Small Heath started 1896–97 badly but {{finished}} frustratingly well, in fourth position. After coming sixth in 1898, they were only two points off the promotion positions with four matches of the 1898–99 season to play; they lost three, drew one, and finished eighth. Walter Abbott set club records that still stand, of 34 league goals in a season and 42 in all competitions. In 1899–1900, Small Heath were never {{out of the top}} four in the division but rarely in the top two, and finished third. Both income and expenditure had doubled over the two First Division seasons. The local press criticised the [...] "penny wise and pound foolish" [...] approach to the signing of players after relegation, and the 1898–99 accounts illustrated an over-reliance on gate receipts: Woolwich Arsenal took £360 less on the gate, but their profit exceeded Small Heath's by nearly £3,000. After an £875 loss the following season, the directors <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> could not continue funding a loss-making enterprise, and suggested that a reduction in players' wages was the only course of action.|$|E
