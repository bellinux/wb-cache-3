In this research it was determined the biodegradation of used vegetable oil based products and their important physico- chemical properties for their suitability in different applications such as chain oil in the forestry equipment and <b>mold</b> <b>oil</b> in concrete casting etc. Biodegradability {{is a measure of the}} ecological nature of products, and thus from an environ- mental point of view, is the most important evaluated property in this research. As a result, all measured properties of the studied recycled vegetable oils show that the products are environmentally friendly. Two types of vegetable oil were studied; three chain oils and two mold oils. The degree of biodegradation (BOD 28 ) of the mold oils, was about 77 % and the biodegradation of chain oils was about 60 % - 62 %.

The sands have been dried with two methods: in a microwave chamber of 750 W power and, for comparison, with classical method at the temperature of 200 °C for 120 minutes. Tensile and bending strength of the samples have been determined after cooling down. It has been found that microwave drying in the low-power device used for experiments is effective only in case of molding sand prepared with addition of DL binder. The temperature of heated, even up to 32 minutes in a microwave chamber, blocks prepared from the remaining two masses, was insufficient to initiate binding process. The undertaken attempts of binder modification and introduction of additives intensifying microwave heating process allowed for achievement of satisfactory results. It has been found that power of the heating device is the main factor determining efficiency of microwave curing of <b>molding</b> sands containing <b>oil</b> binders. An additional experiment has been conducted on a laboratory workstation allowing for microwave heating of small mass samples with a high output power of magnetron concentrated in a small substrate volume. It has been observed that microwave drying process of molding sands was of dynamic character over a short period of time, not exceeding 120 seconds, thus assuring efficient curing of the sands containing the used oil binders. Therefore, application of devices of properly high microwave output power allows for efficient drying of <b>oil</b> <b>molding</b> sands, while simultaneously assuring the possibility to reduce time and energy consumption necessary for production of foundry cores of proper functional characteristics...|$|R

Besides wine, other beverages included pear juice, lychee fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, tea, and pawpaw juice. Dairy products and farming were foreign concepts to the Chinese, which explains the absence of cheese and milk in their diet. Beef was also rarely eaten, since the bull was an important draft animal. The main diet of the lower classes remained rice, pork, and salted fish, while it is known from restaurant dinner menus that the upper classes did not eat dog meat. The rich {{are known to have}} consumed an array of different meats, such as chicken, shellfish, fallow deer, hares, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Local freshwater fish from the nearby lake and river were also caught and brought to market, while the West Lake provided geese and duck as well. Common fruits that were consumed included melons, pomegranates, lychees, longans, golden oranges, jujubes, Chinese and Japanese quinces, apricots and pears; in the region around Hangzhou alone, there were eleven kinds of apricots and eight different kinds of pears that were produced.

40|$|International audienceThe {{starting}} material {{used in this}} study was a cake generated during thermo-mechanical fractionation of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) whole plant in a twin-screw extruder. It was slightly deoiled (16. 7 % of oil in dry matter). Composed mainly of fibers and proteins, it could be considered as a natural composite and was processed successfully into fiberboards by thermo-pressing. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of thermo-pressing conditions on mechanical and heat insulation properties of fiberboards manufactured from this cake. All fiberboards were cohesive, proteins and fibers acting respectively as binder and reinforcing fillers. Highest cake quantity (1000 mg/cm²) led to the highest breaking load (60. 7 N) with a flexural strength at break quite low (2. 9 MPa), lowest elastic modulus (216. 6 MPa), and highest Charpy impact strength (6. 5 kJ/m² for resilience). The increase of pressure applied during molding (from 320 to 360 kgf/cm²) led to an important increase of elastic modulus (from 352. 6 to 728. 6 MPa). Besides, fiberboard molded at 360 kgf/cm² was the most rigid of this study, and logically revealed the most important Shore D surface hardness (52. 6 °). Moreover, lowest molding time (60 s) led to the highest flexural strength at break (3. 9 MPa). The low density of the fiberboards (less than 0. 97) involved promising heat insulation properties. Indeed, thermal conductivity of fiberboards at 25 °C was low (from 103. 5 to 135. 7 mW/m K), and decreased with the increase of thickness. According to their mechanical and heat insulation properties, fiberboards would be potentially usable as inter-layer sheets for pallets, for the manufacture of biodegradable containers (composters, crates for vegetable gardening) by assembly of fiberboards, or for their heat insulation properties in building industry. Moreover, thermo-pressing was not only a molding operation. It also improved the oil extraction efficiency as a part of residual oil was expressed from cake during <b>molding,</b> and total <b>oil</b> yield reached 79. 3 % with a pressure applied of 360 kgf/cm²...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model for the infiltration of a dry textile preform by an injected resin was verified. The model, {{which is based on}} the finite element/control volume technique, determines the total infiltration time and the pressure increase at the mold inlet associated with the RTM process. Important input data for the model are the compaction and permeability behavior of the preform along with the kinetic and rheological behavior of the resin. The compaction behavior for several textile preforms was determined by experimental methods. A power law regression model was used to relate fiber volume fraction to the applied compaction pressure. Results showed a large increase in fiber volume fraction with the initial application of pressure. However, as the maximum fiber volume fraction was approached, the amount of compaction pressure required to decrease the porosity of the preform rapidly increased. Similarly, a power law regression model was used to relate permeability to the fiber volume fraction of the preform. Two methods were used to measure the permeability of the textile preform. The first, known as the steady state method, measures the permeability of a saturated preform under constant flow rate conditions. The second, denoted the advancing front method, determines the permeability of a dry preform to an infiltrating fluid. Water, corn oil, and an epoxy resin, Epon 815, were used to determine the effect of fluid type and viscosity on the steady state permeability behavior of the preform. Permeability values measured with the different fluids showed that fluid viscosity had no influence on the permeability behavior of 162 E-glass and TTI IM 7 / 8 HS preforms. Permeabilities measured from steady state and advancing front experiments for the warp direction of 162 E-glass fabric were similar. This behavior was noticed for tests conducted with corn oil and Epon 815. Comparable behavior was observed for the warp direction of the TTI IM 7 / 8 HS preform and corn <b>oil.</b> <b>Mold</b> filling and flow visualization experiments were performed to verify the analytical computer model. Frequency dependent electromagnetic sensors were used to monitor the resin flow front as a function of time. For the flow visualization tests, a video camera and high resolution tape recorder were used to record the experimental flow fronts. Comparisons between experimental and model predicted flow fronts agreed well for all tests. For the mold filling tests conducted at constant flow rate injection, the model was able to accurately predict the pressure increase at the mold inlet during the infiltration process. A kinetics model developed to predict the degree of cure as a function of time for the injected resin accurately calculated the increase in the degree of cure during the subsequent cure cycle...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, many {{companies}} are engaged in the heading of plasticizers <b>molded</b> in <b>oil</b> refineries, chemical industry, production of phenolic resins mainly generated byindustrial effluents with high concentrations of organic compounds, where they have great highlight the presence of phenolic substances. In the process of production of phenolic resins, exists as a product distilled {{in the presence of}} phenol at high concentrations (approximately 5 %), which is part of industrial wastewater effluent, with this part of the environmental problem that this paper proposes a industry a new technique for recovery, reuse and contribution to the environment. Its adverse effects submitted, the final destination of phenol in the environment and its removal is complicated and difficult by several factors: its high solubility in water at room temperature, its ability to ionize, low vapor pressure, its tendency to oxidation, to possess properties and characteristics of reactivity, stability and amphoteric (not biodegradable), can exist in the environment without losing its character under more drastic harmful, causing negative environmental impact. The proposed method offers new technology to recover the phenol is dissolved in industrial water through a chemical reaction with sodium hydroxide, to recover as sodium phenolate, which serves to reuse in the same process of the phenolic resin of novolac type. The secondary distillate from the distillation process of the sodium phenolate solution, even with traces of phenol was adsorbed completely through the bed of granular activated carbon, which guarantees the residual distillate without the presence of phenol for disposal or sewer outfall; contributing the same management and minimization of environmental impacts, particularly the aquatic environment. In the market there are several methodologies for the removal and wastewater treatment in the presence of phenol from the incineration, chemical degradation, biodegradation up heat, but still the resulting constraints are: phenol incineration of gaseous emissions (CO, CO 2, water vapor, etc [...] ) providing to the pollution of air quality and global warming of the planet earth, treatment of phenol biodegradation involves a need for space very large, low concentration of phenol and specialized bacteria are very sensitive to changing conditions, which is not in the treatment of phenolic industrial wastewater and chemical treatment for thermal degradation is very expensive, unlike the physicochemical and absorption method activated charcoal proposed is efficient, easy to use in the treatment of phenol, using input chemicals (NaOH and granular activated carbon) available on the market at low cost, making the method for the recovery of phenol in wastewater proposed industrial sector represents an alternative in the management and treatment of industrial water in order to preserve the aquatic environment mainly. We have developed a new technique physicochemical laboratorial y technique with an resultat eficient outcome, the proposed method has been shown to 96. 17 % recovery of phenol in industrial wastewater and the rest of phenol is treated with the technique of absorption granular activated carbon, which is demonstrated with a 100 % removal of phenol in industrial waste waters, it contributes to the field of science and industry to management, treatment and disposal charge compatible with the preservation and care of the environment, given that their industrial wastewater to the sewer may be available or surface water body (sea, river, lake, etc.), below the allowable limits, according to relevant industry standards, for example, for the Sub Sector Hydrocarbons must have industrial wastewater below the permissible limits, according to Article 1 of Supreme Decree N º 037 - 2008 -PCM "maximum permissible limits for liquid effluents to the Activities Sub-Sector Oil" to not impact the quality of surface waters in compliance of Supreme Decree N º 002 - 2008 -MINAM and Water Resources Act, it contributes to responsible environmental management, which minimizes the impact to aquatic ecosystems. The recovered phenol through the technique described above is broadly applicable in the same production process of phenolic resins. Phenol recovered can also be applied in the wood's conservation (manufacture of plywood, manufacture of pressed wood, iron, melanites, etc.). This research work in the management and treatment of phenol in industrial wastewater proposed, given other environmental tool to companies engaged in the business phenolic, so they can make use of this method in the management and treatment of these hazardous waste and avoid hiring firms EPS-RS for the management, treatment, transportation and disposal of such hazardous waste to a secure landfill, according to Supreme Decree 057 - 2004 -PCM. With this grant is contributing to environmental management that respects the environment, since it does not have the substance be toxic to aquatic ecosystems, which can negatively impact aquatic flora and fauna. To arrive at developing the experimental part, results from a literature search, mainly in journals or magazines for professionals and researchers, as well as communications made in conferences or symposiums, Doctoral thesis, etc. This research has allowed, among other things, support research that is desired to avoid undertaking research already carried out, to take cognizance of experiments already made to repeat them when necessary, further investigations interrupted or incomplete, seeking information suggestive, select a theoretical framework for the literature review. The undersigned concluyes that the research developed as the main objetive of this thesis is an efficient, economical and easy method for the application during the extraction and separation of phenol in industrial wastewater. It is a contribution to the environmentally responsible management and minimization of hazardous substances that can negatively impact the environment and, finally, is an environmental management tool for industry to manage and minimize environmental impacts. En la actualidad, muchas empresas están dedicadas al rubro de plastificantes moldeables, en las refinerías de petróleo, en la industria de química, en la producción de resinas fenólicas principalmente, que generan efluentes residuales industriales con altas concentraciones de compuestos orgánicos, en donde tienen gran destaque la presencia de sustancias fenólicas. En el proceso de producción de resinas fenólicas, existe como subproducto un destilado con presencia de fenol en altas concentraciones (aproximadamente 5 %), que forma parte del efluente residual industrial, siendo esta parte del problema ambiental, que el presente trabajo de investigación propone a la industria una nueva técnica de recuperación, reuso y aporte al ambiente. Sus efectos adversos presentados, el destino final del fenol en el ambiente y su remoción es complicado y difícil por diversos factores: su alta solubilidad en el agua a temperatura ambiente, su habilidad para ionizarse, su baja presión de vapor, su tendencia a la oxidación, por poseer propiedades y características de reactividad, estabilidad y anfotérico (no biodegradable), puede existir en el ambiente sin perder su carácter nocivo en condiciones más drásticas, causando impacto negativo al medio ambiente. El método propuesto propone una nueva tecnología que consiste en recuperar el fenol disuelto en agua industrial a través de una reacción química con hidróxido de sodio, para recuperar como fenolato de sodio, que sirve para reusar en el mismo proceso de la resina fenólica del tipo las novolacas. El destilado secundario del proceso de destilación de la solución fenolato de sodio, aún con trazas de fenol es adsorbido totalmente a través del lecho de carbón activado granulado, que garantiza el destilado residual sin presencia de fenol para su disposición final al alcantarillado o emisor submarino; la misma que contribuye el manejo y minimización de impacto al medio ambiente, en especial al medio acuático. En el mercado existen varios metodologías para la remoción y tratamiento de aguas residuales con presencia de fenol desde la incineración, biodegradación hasta degradación química térmica, siendo los limitantes más resultantes tenemos: la incineración de fenol genera emisiones gaseosas (CO, CO 2, vapor de agua, etc.) que aporta a la contaminación de la calidad de aire y al calentamiento global de la planeta tierra; tratamiento de fenol por biodegradación involucra necesidad de contar con un espacio muy grande, con baja concentración de fenol y bacterias pecializadas muy sensibles al cambio de condiciones, que no es aplicable en el tratamiento de aguas residuales industriales con fenol; y el tratamiento por degradación química térmica es muy costoso, a diferencia del método fisicoquímico y absorción con carbón activado propuesto, es eficiente, fácil manejo en el tratamiento de fenol, uso de insumo químico comercial (NaOH y carbón activado granulado) a disposición en el mercado con un costo bajo, haciendo que el método para la recuperación de fenol en aguas residuales industriales propuesto represente al sector industrial una alternativa en el manejo y tratamiento de dicho agua industrial con la finalidad de preservar el ambiente acuático principalmente. Se ha desarrollado una nueva técnica fisicoquímica a nivel de laboratorio con resultado eficiente, es decir, con el método propuesto se ha demostrado la recuperación al 96. 17 % de fenol en aguas residuales industriales y, el resto de fenol es tratado con la técnica de absorción con carbón activado granulado, con el cual se demuestra una remoción del 100 % de fenol en aguas industriales, la misma que contribuye al campo científico y al sector industrial a un manejo, tratamiento y disposición final responsable compatible con la preservación y cuidado al medio ambiente, toda vez que sus aguas residuales industriales se puede disponer al alcantarillado o al cuerpo de agua superficial (mar, río, laguna, etc.), por debajo de los límites permitidos, según las normas del sector correspondiente; por ejemplo, para el Sub Sector Hidrocarburos, hay que disponer las aguas residuales industriales por debajo de los límites permisibles, de acuerdo al Art. 1 º del Decreto Supremo Nº 037 - 2008 -PCM “Límites Máximos Permisibles de Efluentes Líquidos para las Actividades del Sub-Sector Hidrocarburos”, a fin de no impactar la calidad de aguas superficiales, en cumplimiento del Decreto Supremo Nº 002 - 2008 -MINAM y la Ley de Recursos Hídricos, la misma que contribuye a un manejo ambiental responsable, que minimiza el impacto al ecosistema acuático. El fenol recuperado a través de la técnica descrito en líneas arriba tiene aplicación en el mismo proceso de producción de resinas fenólicas. También el fenol recuperado puede tener aplicación en el tratamiento de maderas (fabricación de triplay, fabricación de madera prensado, planchas, melanitas, etc.) como preservativos. Con el presente trabajo de investigación en el manejo y tratamiento de fenol en aguas residuales industriales se propone otra herramienta ambiental a las empresas dedicadas en el rubro fenólicas, para que pueden hacer uso de este método en el manejo y tratamiento de estos residuos peligrosos y así evitar contratar empresas EPS-RS para el manejo, tratamiento, transporte y disposición final de dicho residuo peligroso a un relleno de seguridad, de acuerdo al Decreto Supremo N° 057 - 2004 -PCM. Con este aporte se está contribuyendo al manejo ambiental responsable con el medio ambiente, toda vez que no se va disponer la sustancia toxica al ecosistema acuático, que puede impactar negativamente a la flora y fauna acuática. Para llegar a desarrollar la parte experimental, se ha realizado una investigación bibliográfica, fundamentalmente en journals o revistas destinadas a profesionales e investigadores, como así también las comunicaciones hechas en Congresos o Simposios, tesis de doctorado, etc. Esta indagación ha permitido, entre otras cosas, apoyar la investigación que se desea realizar, evitar emprender investigaciones ya realizadas, tomar conocimiento de experimentos ya hechos para repetirlos cuando sea necesario, continuar investigaciones interrumpidas o incompletas, buscar información sugerente, seleccionar un marco teórico para el estudio bibliográfico. El suscrito concluye que el trabajo de investigación desarrollado que es materia de esta tesis, es un eficiente, económico y método fácil en la aplicación en la extracción y separación de fenol en aguas residuales industriales. Es una contribución en el manejo responsable con el ambiente y minimización de sustancias peligrosas que puede impactar negativamente al medio ambiente y, finalmente, es una herramienta de gestión ambiental para el sector industrial para el manejo y minimización de impactos al medio ambiente...|$|R
