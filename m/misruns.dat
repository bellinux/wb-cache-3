40|$|Abstract — During mould {{filling in}} casting process, defects such as <b>misrun,</b> cold shut, gas and oxide film {{entrapment}} and shrinkage often occur. The development of filling related defects are mainly governed by metal fillability. In practice, these defects are eliminated by iteratively designing casting filling (gating) system through experience and experiments, but it requires {{large number of}} shop floor trials; taking huge amount of resources (cost) and time. This can be avoided by conducting trials on computer using casting simulation technology. Three varying thickness parts with different shape complexity {{have been designed to}} quantify the mould filling characteristic. Part shape complexity depends on geometry parameters such as volume and surface area of part, volume of thin section, section thickness, number of cored features, core volume etc. Mould filling and solidification analysis of these parts have been carried out using ANSYS. The information derived from the simulation is used to quantify the metal fillability index. A linear correlation has been found between shape complexity and mould fillability index. It is observed that more complex part has poor fillability index (and thus, poor manufacturability) as compared with less complex parts.

50|$|The {{gating system}} serves many purposes, the most {{important}} being conveying the liquid material to the mold, but also controlling shrinkage, {{the speed of the}} liquid, turbulence, and trapping dross. The gates are usually attached to the thickest part of the casting to assist in controlling shrinkage. In especially large castings multiple gates or runners may be required to introduce metal to more than one point in the mold cavity. The speed of the material is important because if the material is traveling too slowly it can cool before completely filling, leading to <b>misruns</b> and cold shuts. If the material is moving too fast then the liquid material can erode the mold and contaminate the final casting. The shape and length of the gating system can also control how quickly the material cools; short round or square channels minimize heat loss.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} main disadvantages: high tooling cost, limited to low-melting-point metals, and short mold life. The high tooling costs make this process {{uneconomical}} for small production runs. When {{the process is}} used to cast steel or iron the mold life is extremely short. For lower melting point metals the mold life is longer but thermal fatigue and erosion usually limit the life to 10,000 to 120,000 cycles. The mold life is dependent on four factors: the mold material, the pouring temperature, the mold temperature, and the mold configuration. Molds made from gray cast iron can be more economical to produce but have short mold lives. On the other hand, molds made from H13 tool steel may have a mold life several times greater. The pouring temperature {{is dependent on the}} casting metal, but the higher the pouring temperature the shorter the mold life. A high pouring temperature can also induce shrinkage problems and create longer cycle times. If the mold temperature is too low <b>misruns</b> are produced, but if the mold temperature is too high then the cycle time is prolonged and mold erosion is increased. Large differences in section thickness in the mold or casting can decrease mold life as well.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{numerical}} investigations {{for development}} of a near net shape casting process for TiAl alloy are presented. The casting object used in this work is low pressure turbine (LPT) blade, which is characterized by extremely thin section areas that are prone to <b>misruns.</b> The work specifically focuses on predictions of <b>misruns</b> and developing strategies to avoid them. The numerical simulation methodology used in this work, is based on modelling all the three-phases i. e., gas, liquid and solid. The modelling approach is based on finite-volume method and arbitrary polyhedral control volumes to solve the governing equations. For predictions of <b>misruns,</b> the solidified melt is stopped by providing additional resistance of the growing dendrite network to melt flow during solidification. An additional source term in the momentum equation based on Kozeny-Carman relation for permeability estimation is implemented. The numerical methodology is validated for modelling of interfacial heat transfer due to formation of air gap during solidification process. Numerical modelling of mould filling is validated against experimental results to predict entrainment defects in casting processes. A fine mesh is used to explain and validate the mechanisms of formation of bubbles, gas and oxide entrapment and their transport in a gravity casting process. Numerical prediction of <b>misruns</b> is evaluated on a gravity casting experiment for a LPT blade. Numerical simulations are applied to a centrifugal casting process of a cluster of several LPT blades. In order to understand and prevent the formation of <b>misruns,</b> numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate reasons for temperature loss, slower mould filling or eliminating thin cross sections of casting. From the numerical simulations, {{it is observed that}} prevention of <b>misruns,</b> specifically along the trailing edges, is difficult.

The welding techniques can be applied by using weld material consisting of magnesium alloy, as well as for regeneration of alloys after excessive wear.

The main reasons for wear are the cracks appearing during welding in brittleness high-temperature range. This work in combination with industrial tests of casting welding show that the causes of high-temperature brittleness are the partial tears of the structure and the hot cracks of both the castings and the welded and padded joints.

40|$|Understanding of the {{mechanism}} of the vibration needed to fill thin section or one with sharp edges in profile shapes and clarifying the dominant control parameters of the vibration in thin wall investment casting is key to producing sound casting (one free of <b>misrun</b> defects). It's also a central issue for study in this thesis. The filling capability in thin wall investment casting method was assessed in relation to metal head. It {{was found that the}} effect of the vibration on the metal head is markedly dependent on acceleration. Generally, it was observed that the metal head required to force the metal in thin sections in the casting vibrated at (1 g) acceleration is approximately half that used in castings made without vibration. Two potential mechanisms were observed from the experimental result during the filling process in thin wall casting i] discontinuous propagation flow in vibration conditions; and ii] continuous propagation flow without vibration. These mechanisms may be acting to modify the contact angles between liquid metal and a wall of the mould. Experiments also showed that two features of the transition can be observed {{from the front of the}} morphology; i] a coherent liquid metal front - this occurs in thin wall investment casting when the acceleration due to vibration is less than (1 g); and ii] jetting at the free surface - this occurs in thin wall investment casting when the acceleration due to vibration exceeds 1 g. This is present in terms of a unifying concept, using a frequency and amplitude (f - a) map. The time of the vibration operation has a moderate effect on the relative filling area when the acceleration is less than 1 g. However, it is more effective when the acceleration of the vibration is greater than 1 g. The mathematical models comprised one-dimensional heat transfer with phase change and had an established flow field for molten A 356 alloys flow in the thin section ceramic channel mould. The work was concerned with the fluidity of A 356 alloys in thin wall investment casting with and without vibration in two type of filling (flowability and fillability filling types), combining heat and metal flow in addition to the simultaneous solidification stage. The results of the mathematical model, produced agreement with the experimental test carried out in the foundry and also agreed with other published data. The results on fluidity indicated that the fluidity of the molten metal was affected by mould temperature, pouring temperature, the velocity of the molten metal flow relative to the surface tension and the channel thickness. The data used in the mathematical model of the fluidity in thin section under vibration condition were deduced experimentally; namely, velocity of the molten metal and the heat transfer coefficient between the liquid metal and the chilled surface of the mould. This model was used to estimate the fluidity characteristics in thin wall investment casting with and without vibration. Real-time X-ray observation and computer modelling of the metal head-driven mould filling sequences reveal that no surface turbulence occurred when the liquid metal flowed into the thin section and the advance metal front continued to flow under surface tension control. X-ray was also used to measure the flow time and the velocity of the metal inside the thin channel and confirm the modification on Bernoullis Equation (kinetic energy+ potential energy = constant) to estimate the velocity relative to surface tension in the fluidity mathematical model. Flow- 3 D software was used to calculate the velocity of the liquid metal in the flowability filling type and the fluidity characteristics. Weibull analysis identifies the acceleration vibration as practical criterion to judge the reliability of casting. A vibration mould with vertical direction in the thin wall investment casting after filling can make the liquid metal flow into the thin section under surface tension control. This technique is used to achieve mould filling free from <b>misrun</b> defects and surface turbulence and this makes vibration casting a promising technique for producing high quality castings. On the basis of these findings, an operation window for the production of reliable castings has for the first time been developed in this research.

Investment casting by {{the lost}} wax {{process has been}} used for centuries for casting statues and other art {{castings}} and this is still its main outlet in the bronze foundry industry. It is also a process worth considering where complex, high precision components are required as it offers the opportunity to make by a single casting an object that might otherwise entail difficult and expensive machining or a welded or brazed assembly. The process uses a pattern of wax or other low melting point material which has itself to be cast in a mould, although it may be built up from several parts. The pattern is invested with a refractory slurry several coatings being applied to build up a shell of adequate strength. The pattern is then melted out of this shell which is baked to strengthen the bonding of the refractory and remove moisture. It is then ready for casting. Casting defects are undesirable in critical structural areas and on surfaces. Minor defects that would not be particulary noticeable can become quite obvious after surface treatment. Various defects can occur in manufacturing processes, depending on factors such as materials, part design, and processing techniques. While some defects affect only the appearance of parts, others can have major adverse effects on the structural integrity of parts made. Several defects can develop in castings. For example; gas porosity, hot cracks, <b>misrun,</b> slag, cold shut. Problem solving techniques are used for detecting and solving problems caused by defaults that are already occurred or might be occurred.

The purpose of this Master Thesis was to perform literary studies on coal, borehole stability of fractured formations and previous coal experience, and tie this back to the experienced problems with running screens in the Åre reservoir. Some of the main results are shown below: o Coal is a combustible, organic rock with large heterogeneities and anisotropydue to a very characteristic cleat system. With confining strengths Heidrun coal are quite strong with a UCS of 37 MPa from rock mechanical laboratory testing performed by SINTEF. However, due to the cleat system coal appearsas an easily friable rock, which can cause significant problem downhole whenrunning equipment like open hole screen completions, as is the case on Heidrun. o The presence of coal in the Heidrun reservoir has been investigated, as has the coal appearance in Åre problem wells. The coalbed thickness is mostly quite small, about 0, 5 mTVD, and this would most likely not cause a problem inlow to medium angle wells. Almost horizontal wells on the other hand canhave severe differences with this thickness, well illustrated by well A- 24 T 2. o Due to the unpredictable nature of the coal abundance and cleat orientation some uncertainties can not be eliminated in the planning phase. o Even though there are at least 4 of the problem wells that seemingly has nocoal in them, the general assumption from CPI logs is that coal is the mainproblem geology regarding hole enlargements and possible ledge problematic. o Due to the cleat system, coal can be particularly sensitive to pressure transients, caused by surge/swab and ECD variations. This also applies to other geologies, but to a much smaller degree. The solution can prove to be implementing a good mud system that can prevent pressure equalization through the cleat system of coal. Also LEDO drilling and “finesse” during drilling operations are recommended. o The increase in failure wells in the recent years can possibly explained by an increase in ECD and other pressure transients. In addition, depletion in thereservoir can in case of a permeable borehole wall and high angles have a negative effect on stability. </p...|$|R
