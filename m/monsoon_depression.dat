5|$|In late July, a <b>monsoon</b> <b>depression</b> {{moved across}} much of India, and another monsoon {{disturbance}} persisted {{off the coast of}} Pakistan. The interaction between the two systems resulted in heavy rainfall across the region, flooding dozens of villages. Monsoonal rainfall killed 285people between Pakistan and India in the summer of 2003. In late August, another <b>monsoon</b> <b>depression</b> moved across northeastern India. A depression that struck Andhra Pradesh in India killed 21people in early October. Later that month, a tropical depression crossed Thailand from the western Pacific Ocean, contributing to ongoing flooding that killed 19. Once in the Indian Ocean, this system struck southeastern India without causing much damage. The last system of the year was a cyclonic storm that struck southeastern India in December, killing 81people and causing $28million in damage (2003USD).|$|E
5|$|In the typhoon's early stages, {{news reports}} {{stated that the}} outer bands of the storm {{produced}} heavy rainfall in the Philippines, resulting in 16 fatalities. However, a meteorological analysis of the storm showed that Kirogi was {{not responsible for the}} rain; instead, a <b>monsoon</b> <b>depression</b> that later became Typhoon Kai-tak caused the flooding rains. Typhoon Kirogi was never closer than 835km (520mi) from the Philippines. However, large swells produced by the storm caused moderate damage along coastal areas of the Philippines, forcing workers in Manila to clear debris left by the damaging waves.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} January, a broad low persisted {{south of}} the Chagos archipelago, {{becoming}} a tropical disturbance on January30 about 650km (400mi) south of Diego Garcia. The convection gradually organized as the system moved to the south-southwest, steered by {{a break in the}} ridge to the south caused by the remnants of Cyclone Charly. Initially the circulation was very broad, and due to its involvement with the monsoon, it resembled a <b>monsoon</b> <b>depression.</b> Early on February1, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression while turning more to the south. Around that time, it passed about 500km (310mi) east of Rodrigues. The system became extratropical on February3, after increased wind shear weakened the convection. The former depression intensified as an extratropical storm, attaining gale force winds while accelerating its forward motion due to an approaching trough. The system was no longer tracked after February6 as it approached the polar latitudes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> {{over the}} Bay of Bengal develop almost entirely in July and August. After studies {{conducted}} by Lindzen et al. (1980) and Stevens and Lindzen (1978), only barotropic instability remains {{as a mechanism}} {{for the development of}} the wave disturbances associated with <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions.</b> The present investigation has the objective to show that barotropic instability is able to explain the wave aspects of <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions,</b> but that normal mode analysis is inadequate. It is found that the local barotropically unstable response to regional perturbations in the Bay of Bengal during July and August will be dominated by the lower troposphere. The analysis clearly identifies the features of the mean flow which lead to <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> in July. The features include the development of an easterly jet as opposed to semijet structure in the mean flow, and the development of a modest easterly flow at the jet center as opposed to westerly flow...|$|R
40|$|The {{accepted}} {{explanation for}} the heavy rainfall in southwest <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> in India {{on the basis of}} fronter structure is not supported by radio-sonde data. An alternative explanation on the basis of convergence derived from the isobaric patterns is offered. It has also been applied to satisfactorily explain the distribution of heavy rain in the post-monsoon depressions...|$|R
40|$|The Hamburg {{atmospheric}} {{general circulation}} model ECHAM 3 at T 106 resolution (1. 125 * lat. /lon.) has considerable skill in reproducing the observed seasonal reversal of {{mean sea level}} pressure, {{the location of the}} summer heat low as well as the position of the monsoon trough over the Indian subcontinent. The present-day climate and its seasonal cycle are realistically simulated by the model over this region. The model simulates the structure, intensity, frequency, movement and lifetime of <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> remarkably well. The number of monsoon depressions/storms simulated by the model in a year ranged from 5 to 12 with an average frequency of 8. 4 yr- 1, not significantly different from the observed climatology. The model also simulates the interannual variability in the formation of depressions over the north Bay of Bengal during the summer monsoon season. In the warmer atmosphere under doubled CO 2 conditions, the number of monsoon depressions/cyclonic storms forming in Indian seas in a year ranged from 5 to 11 with an average frequency of 7. 6 yr- 1, not significantly different from those inferred in the control run of the model. However, under doubled CO 2 conditions, fewer depressions formed in the month of June. Neither the lowest central pressure nor the maximum wind speed changes appreciably in <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> identified under simulated enhanced greenhouse conditions. The analysis suggests there will be no significant changes in the number and intensity of <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> in a warmer atmosphere...|$|R
5|$|Upon {{developing}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone, {{the storm was}} moving west-northwestward, influenced by a ridge to its north. It was located over an area of warm sea surface temperatures and moderate wind shear, which favored gradual intensification. The convection diminished during a diurnal cycle before redeveloping the next day. Maintaining an unusually large size, the depression slowly organized, gradually separating from the trough from which it developed. On October19, the CPHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Neki, and shortly thereafter the storm turned toward the northwest. By the next day, the cyclone resembled {{the structure of a}} <b>monsoon</b> <b>depression</b> typically found in the western Pacific Ocean. However, the structure began to more resemble a tropical cyclone after the outermost convection diminished and the thunderstorms around the center increased. Following the development of a banding-eye feature, Neki intensified into a hurricane early on October21 about 625mi (1010km) southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii, or about 335mi (535km) east-southeast of Johnston Atoll.|$|E
5|$|In early April, {{the monsoon}} trough {{established}} itself across Micronesia near the equator. An area of convection within the trough {{developed in the}} Caroline Islands on April 9, and resembled {{the characteristics of a}} <b>monsoon</b> <b>depression.</b> Shortly thereafter, a large, yet weak low-level circulation formed within the system. The system drifted erratically for several days as it slowly organized; the system underwent several cycles of developing and losing convection. On April 11, the system maintained a persistent area of well-organized deep convection, and subsequent to an increase in upper-level outflow, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 02W at 1800UTC on April 11. Strong influence from the monsoonal westerlies left the depression drifting and slowly executing a loop to the northwest. Based on sufficient satellite classifications, JTWC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isa early on April 12 while it was located 105km (65mi) of Pohnpei. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) simultaneously classified the system as a tropical depression, and upgraded it to a tropical storm early on April 13.|$|E
25|$|The {{drought in}} 1982–83 is {{regarded}} as the worst of the twentieth century for short-term rainfall deficiencies of up to one year and their over-all impact. There were severe dust storms in north-western Victoria and severe bushfires in south-east Australia in February 1983 with 75people killed. This El Niño-related drought ended in March, when a <b>monsoon</b> <b>depression</b> became an extratropical low and swept across Australia's interior and on to the south-east in mid- to late March.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{for the formation}} and movement of <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> are discussed. The east-west oriented monsoon throughs which move north and south and appear over the Bay of Bengal and move northwest over India are examined. The mechanisms of formation and movement are summarized: (1) <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> over the Bay of Bengal are caused either by amplification of westward propagating weak disturbances or by downward propagation of the internal jet instability of the easterly jet; (2) the barotropic instability of the low level flow over the Bay of Bengal is conductive {{to the growth of}} weak disturbances; (3) the CISK is the primary driving mechanism for the rapid growth for a preexisting weak perturbation; and (4) once the disturbance has attained adequate amplitude in the lower levels, the low level moisture convergence and latent heat condensation is utilized more efficiently {{for the development of a}} vertically coupled deep disturbance which along with upper level easterlies contribute to the westward propagation of the disturbance...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} analysis and assimilation procedure with the FGGE/MONEX data are described. Numerical predictions with the GLAS general circulation model {{were made from}} the two initial conditions arrived at by assimilating the two different data sets. The model, the analysis and assimilation procedure, {{the differences in the}} analyses due to different data inputs, and the differences in the numerical prediction of <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> are outlined...|$|R
50|$|The {{season was}} the sixth {{in a row}} with below normal activity, based on the {{seasonal}} accumulated cyclone energy. Storms generally develop when the monsoon trough is located over tropical waters, with a peak from May to June and another peak in November. The monsoon developed 11 distinct low pressure areas {{by the end of}} September, including five <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions,</b> and the <b>monsoon</b> season was more active than usual.|$|R
500|$|If a {{circulation}} forms within the monsoon trough, it {{is able to}} compete with the neighboring thermal low over the continent, and a wind surge will occur at its periphery. [...] Such {{a circulation}} which is broad in nature within a monsoon trough is known as a <b>monsoon</b> <b>depression.</b> [...] In the Northern Hemisphere, monsoon depressions are generally asymmetric, and tend to have their strongest winds on their eastern periphery. [...] Light and variable winds cover a large area near their center, while bands of showers and thunderstorms develop within their area of circulation.|$|E
500|$|The {{presence}} of an upper level jet stream poleward and west of the system can enhance its development by leading to increased diverging air aloft over the <b>monsoon</b> <b>depression,</b> {{which leads to a}} corresponding drop in surface pressure. [...] Even though these systems can develop over land, the outer portions of monsoon depressions are similar to tropical cyclones. [...] In India, for example, 6 to 7 monsoon depressions move across the country yearly, and their numbers within the Bay of Bengal increase during July and August of El Niño events. [...] Monsoon depressions are efficient rainfall producers, and can cause a year's worth of rainfall when they move through drier areas [...] such as the outback of Australia.|$|E
500|$|On June6, a <b>monsoon</b> <b>depression</b> {{formed in}} the Arabian Sea about 500km (315mi) {{south-southwest}} of Goa, India. It initially paralleled the Indian coastline, becoming a tropical storm on June9 with a minimum barometric pressure of [...] That day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began tracking the system. The storm moved northward, followed by a northwest turn on June10. It curved toward the west, and the JTWC reported the cyclone as reaching peak 1minute sustained winds of 110km/h (70mph) on June11. In addition, the India Meteorological Department estimated the system became a severe cyclonic storm, which has sustained winds of at least [...] On June12, the storm attained a minimum pressure of [...] while continuing westward.|$|E
40|$|If barotropically {{unstable}} easterly jets may {{be approximated by}} {{broken line}} profiles, it becomes possible to use the solutions of the Charney (1947) problem for baroclinic instabilithy in order to solve the barotropic problem. Results are presented for easterly jets having an arbitrary degree of symmetry, and {{it is noted that}} the convenient calculation obtained for the growth of both localized and normal mode perturbations is important in the study of <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> over India...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> develop from the regenesis of westward-propagating residual lows from the east. Most of these residual lows {{can be traced}} to weather disturbances in the south China Sea, including tropical cyclones and 12 – 24 -day monsoon lows. Hypothetically, any mechanism causing a variation in the occurrence frequency of these two types of weather disturbances in the western tropical Pacific–south China Sea (WTP–SCS) region may result in a corresponding change in the formation frequency of <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> over the Bay of Bengal. Two such possible mechanisms are interannual and intraseasonal variations of large-scale summer circulation in the WTP–SCS region induced by 1) the interannual variation of the sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern tropical Pacific and 2) the northward migration of the 30 – 60 -day monsoon trough/ridge. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis data and the 6 -hourly tropical cyclone track collected by the Japan Meteorological Agency for the period of 1979 – 94 were analyzed to substantiate the aforementioned hypothesis. The findings are as follows. 1) Interannual variation. Based upon the SST averaged over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administratio...|$|R
40|$|ERA-Interim reanalysis {{data from}} the past 35 years have been used with a newly-developed feature {{tracking}} algorithm to identify Indian <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> originating {{in or near the}} Bay of Bengal. These were then rotated, centralised and combined to give a fully three-dimensional 106 -depression composite structure – a considerably larger sample than any previous detailed study on <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> and their structure. Many known features of depression structure are confirmed, particularly the existence of a maximum to the southwest of the centre in rainfall and other fields, and a westward axial tilt in others. Additionally, the depressions are found to have significant asymmetry due to the presence of the Himalayas; a bimodal mid-tropospheric potential vorticity core; a separation into thermally cold- (~– 1. 5 K) and neutral- (~ 0 K) cores near the surface with distinct properties; and that the centre has very large CAPE and very small CIN. Variability as a function of background state has also been explored, with land/coast/sea, diurnal, ENSO, active/break and Indian Ocean Dipole contrasts considered. Depressions are found to be markedly stronger during the active phase of the monsoon, as well as during La Niña. Depressions on land are shown to be more intense and more tightly constrained to the central axis. A detailed schematic diagram of a vertical cross-section through a composite depression is also presented, showing its inherent asymmetric structure...|$|R
500|$|For {{most of its}} duration, Nicole {{maintained}} a generally northeastward motion, caught in the steering flow between a large mid- to upper-level trough and an anticyclone to the west. Within hours of the storm's formation, observations from a Hurricane Hunters flight confirmed a composition {{similar to the one}} initially discerned, with the strongest gusts and thunderstorms dislocated 250mi (400km) east from the ill-defined center. In comparison, the core consisted of light winds and sporadic convection—a structure rather characteristic of a North Indian Ocean <b>monsoon</b> <b>depression.</b> The system's ambiguous nature led to disagreement among weather specialist over its classification: while the NHC maintained its tropical cyclone status, Cuban meteorologist José Rubiera stated that [...] "no tropical storm exists over , or near it," [...] noting a lack of significant winds in the country's vicinity.|$|E
500|$|On August 9, 1975, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) {{designated}} a tropical {{depression in the}} South China Sea. The depression did not initially develop further as it meandered offshore Taiwan and passed through the Ryuku Islands. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated that a <b>monsoon</b> <b>depression</b> formed over [...] southeast of Okinawa on August18. Drifting first east then westward, Rita was upgraded into a tropical storm the next day by both the JTWC and JMA, based on Hurricane Hunter reports of storm-force winds. Due to a weakening subtropical ridge east of Japan, the storm reversed back to an easterly direction near {{the northern tip of}} Okinawa. Rita strengthened into a typhoon, the sixth of the season, on the afternoon of the August21 as the storm grew significantly in size, especially in the eastern semicircle.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the storm}} formed, sea surface {{temperatures}} were above normal in the Bay of Campeche and tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. After Hurricane Earl developed {{and moved away}} from the region, a broad area of low pressure formed in the southwest Caribbean on September 4. It moved to the northwest and slowly organized in the Gulf of Mexico, although a series of tropical waves prevented rapid development. By September8, there was a large area of convection located over the western Gulf of Mexico. That day, the system developed into Tropical Depression Six while [...] east-southeast of Brownsville, Texas. Initially, the depression was large, without a well-defined center of circulation. [...] It more resembled a <b>monsoon</b> <b>depression</b> commonly seen in the Western Pacific Ocean and the Northern Indian Ocean.

500|$|On July28, {{the system}} began moving {{more to the}} south and southeast, {{although}} its movement was very slow, possibly affected by another <b>monsoon</b> <b>depression</b> over western India. The IMD described the track as [...] "unique", taking a [...] "semi-circular path over the northeast [...]" [...] At 00:00UTC on the next day, the IMD upgraded the depression to a deep depression, and three hours later the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 02B, located 135km (85mi) southwest of Chittagong, Bangladesh. A tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast imparted dry air, but otherwise, conditions were generally favorable. A ridge over Myanmar turned the system to the north on July29. During that day, the circulation was somewhat elongated and exposed from the convection, while the thunderstorms in the southern periphery organized into spiral rainbands. At 18:00UTC on July29, the IMD upgraded the system to Cyclonic Storm Komen, one of only four storms of such intensity in July since 1965; typically, low pressure areas that form in the month are in the extreme northern periphery of the Bay of Bengal, allowing little time to develop over waters, and usually impeded by wind shear.|$|E

On the afternoon of September 11, the system strengthened into a tropical storm as it turned more to the west. On September 12, the system passed south of Hong Kong. Winds gusted to 50 kn at Waglan Island as the system passed by. As Luke approached Hainan Island, it weakened due to the island's rough topography.

40|$|Indian <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions</b> (MDs) are synoptic-scale {{cyclonic}} {{systems that}} propagate across peninsular India {{three or four}} times per monsoon season. They are responsible for the majority of rainfall in agrarian north India, thus constraining precipitation estimates is of high importance. Here, we use a case study from August 2014 to explore the relationship between varying soil moisture and the resulting track and structure of an incident MD using the Met Office Unified Model. We use this case study with the view to increasing understanding of the general impact of soil moisture perturbations on <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions.</b> It is found that increasing soil moisture in the monsoon trough region results in deeper inland penetration and a more developed structure - e. g. a warmer core in the mid-troposphere and a stronger bimodal potential vorticity core in the middle/lower troposphere - with more precipitation, and a structure that in general more closely resembles that found in depressions over the ocean, indicating that soil moisture may enhance the convective mechanism that drives depressions over land. This experiment also shows that these changes are most significant when the depression is deep, and negligible when it is weakening. Increasing soil moisture in the sub-Himalayan arable zone, a region with large irrigation coverage, also caused deeper inland penetration and some feature enhancement in the upper troposphere but no significant changes were found in the track heading or lower-tropospheric structure...|$|R

In this study, satellite data from the CloudSat and recently concluded TRMM missions are used in conjunction with an independently evaluated tracking algorithm to form a three-dimensional composite image of cloud structure and precipitation within <b>monsoon</b> <b>depressions.</b> The composite comprises 34 depressions from the 1998 – 2014 TRMM mission and 12 from the 2007 -present CloudSat mission, and is statistically robust enough to allow significant probing of the spatiotemporal characteristics of moisture and hydrometeor fields. Among the key results of this work are the discovery and characterisation of a bimodal, diurnal cycle in surface precipitation; the first picture of the structure of cloud type and density in depressions, showing that deep convection dominates south of the centre and prominent cirrus throughout; the first composite picture of vertical hydrometeor structure in depressions, showing significant precipitation for hundreds of kilometres outside the centre and well past the mid-troposphere; and novel discussion of drop size distributions (showing significant uniformity across the depression) and resulting latent heat profiles, showing average heating rates near the centre can reach 2 K/hr...|$|R

These trends were underlied by decadal declining trends of wind speed which in turn could be associated with a declining trend of the Siberian High atmospheric anomaly (Fig.  3).
