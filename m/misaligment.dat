50|$|The cross-{{cover test}}, or {{alternating}} cover test is usually employed to detect heterophoria. One eye is covered, {{and then the}} cover is moved immediately {{over to the other}} eye. With heterophoria, when the cover is moved to the other eye, the eye that has just been uncovered can be seen to move from a deviated point. The difference between heterotropia and heterophoria can be easily understood as follows. With heterotropia, a correcting movement of the eye can be detected already by the simple cover test; with heterophoria, such correcting movement only takes place in the cross-cover test. The reason is that subjects with heterophoria are able to create and maintain binocular fusion through vergence, and the cross-cover test purposely breaks this fusion, making the latent <b>misaligment</b> visible.|$|E
40|$|Relationships are a {{valuable}} technology to produce loans. (Berger and Udell [1995], Petersen and Rajan [1994], Aoki and Dinç [2002]). While there are convincing theories in which relationships solve hidden action or hidden information problems, {{there is very}} little empirical corroboration of either theory. In this paper, we assess the empirically validity of these theories in the small firm credit market. While results suggest that relationships are more valuable for firms with worse incentive <b>misaligment</b> problems, more informationally opaque firms do not seem to extract more value from relationships. Contrary to what most empirical research on the value of relationships has assumed (but not tested), this indicates that relationships are, at very least, as important for aligning incentives as they are for solving hidden information problems. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} the growth effects of real exchange rate (RER) misalignments and their volatility. We calculate RER <b>misaligments</b> as deviations of actual RERs from their equilibrium for 60 countries over 1965 - 2003 using panel and time series cointegration methods.

40|$|In {{order to}} design {{appropriate}} exchange rate policies, it is instrumental {{to understand the}} sources of real and nominal exchange rate movements. We apply and extend the structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model of Clarida and Gali (1994) {{in order to identify}} the importance of various types of real shocks (labour supply, aggregate supply and aggregate demand) and nominal shocks (money demand and money supply) for European and transatlantic exchange rate movements. It is found that whilst real and nominal U. S. dollar exchange rates are driven predominantly by relative demand shocks, European real and nominal exchange rate movements have distinctly different roots. The bulk of European relative price and nominal exchange rate movements {{can be explained by the}} differential long-run impact of monetary policy, and moving to EMU will eliminate both. However, <b>misaligments</b> are likely to persist between the Euro-area and the economies outside the Union. It is argued that for these fringe currencies the pegging the exchange rate vis-a-vis the Euro has to be supplemented by special institutional arrangements (formal policy coordination or a currency board) in order to avoid potentially destabilizing asymmetric monetary policy shocks.

40|$|Abstract. The rich {{variety of}} micron-scale {{features}} {{observed in the}} orientation-dependent surface morphology of crystalline silicon during anisotropic wet chemical etching is shown to have its origin at the atomistic scale. Realistic Monte Carlo simulations show that the pyramidal hillocks on Si(100) {{are the result of}} local stabilization of distributed apex atoms by (metal) impurities from solution. In the absence of this stabilization, shallow round pits are formed on Si(100) {{as a result of the}} anisotropy between (one layer deep) pit nucleation and (isotropic) step propagation. It is also concluded that nosed zigzag structures at vicinal (110) are the combined result of <b>misaligment</b> and the etching anisotropy, showing that the nucleating mechanisms of morphologically related structures such as pyramidal hillocks and nosed zigzags are not necessarily the same. The simulations confirm that the formation of (one layer deep) triangular and hexagonal pits on exact Si(111) and of polygonal (saw-shaped) and straight terraces in vicinal Si(111) depends on the relative rate of [12 ̄ 1] and [1 ̄ 21 ̄] step propagation and on the misorientation of the surface with respect to Si(111) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aromatic}} amine carcinogen 2 -aminofluorene (AF) forms covalent adducts with DNA, predominantly with guanine at the C 8 position. Such lesions are bypassed by Y-family polymerases such as Dpo 4 via error-free and error-prone mechanisms. We show that Dpo 4 catalyzes elongation from a correct 3 ′-terminal C opposite [AF]G in a nonrepetitive template sequence with low efficiency. This extension leads to cognate full-length product, {{as well as}} mis-elongated products containing base mutations and deletions. Crystal structures of the Dpo 4 ternary complex with the 3 ′-terminal primer C base opposite [AF]G in the anti conformation and with the AF-moiety positioned in the major groove, revealed both accurate and misalignment-mediated mutagenic extension pathways. The mutagenic template/primer-dNTP arrangement is promoted by interactions between the polymerase and the bulky lesion, rather than by a base pairstabilized <b>misaligment.</b> Further extension leads to semi-targeted mutations via this proposed polymerase-guided mechanism.

40|$|The {{major sources}} causing {{deterioration}} of optical quality in extremely large optical telescopes are misadjustments of the mirrors, deformations of monolithic mirrors, and misalignments of segments in segmented mirrors. For active optics corrections, all three errors, which can partially compensate each other, are measured simultaneously. It is therefore {{of interest to}} understand {{the similarities and differences}} between the three corresponding types of modes which describe these errors. The first two types are best represented by Zernike polynomials and elastic modes respectively, both of them being continuous and smooth functions. The segment <b>misaligment</b> modes, which are derived by singular value decomposition, are by their nature not smooth and in general discontinuous. However, for mirrors with a large number of segments, the lowest modes become effectively both smooth and continuous. This paper derives analytical expressions for these modes, using differential operators and their adjoints, for the limit case of infinitesimally small segments. For segmented mirrors with approximately 1000 segments, it is shown that these modes agree well with the corresponding lowest singular value decomposition modes. Furthermore, the analytical expressions reveal the nature of the segment misalignment modes and allow for a detailed comparison with the elastic modes of monolithic mirrors. Some mathematical features emerge as identical in the two cases. Comment: 24 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in Journal of Modern Optic...|$|E

After removing the stellar contribution, we used the cross-correlation technique to obtain the radial velocity of the dominant gaseous component. The main kinematic parameters were directly derived from the radial velocities with no assumptions on the internal motions.

40|$|We {{study the}} origin of the wide {{distribution}} of angles between the angular momenta of the stellar and gas components, α_ G,S, in early-type galaxies (ETGs). We use the GALFORM model of galaxy formation, set in the Λ cold dark matter framework, and coupled it with a Monte-Carlo simulation to follow the angular momenta flips driven by matter accretion onto haloes and galaxies. We consider a gas disk to be misaligned with respect to the stellar body if α_ G,S> 30 degrees. By assuming that the only sources of <b>misaligments</b> in galaxies are galaxy mergers, we place a lower limit of 2 - 5 per cent on the fraction of ETGs with misaligned gas/stellar components. These low fractions are inconsistent with the observed value of ≈ 42 ± 6 per cent in ATLAS^ 3 D. In the more general case, in which smooth gas accretion in addition to galaxy mergers can drive misalignments, our calculation predicts that ≈ 46 per cent of ETGs have α_ G,S> 30 degrees. In this calculation, we find correlations between α_ G,S and stellar mass, cold gas fraction and star formation rate, such that ETGs with high masses, low cold gas fractions and low star formation rates are more likely to display aligned cold gas and stellar components. We confirm these trends observationally for the first time using ATLAS^ 3 D data. We argue that the high fraction of misaligned gas discs observed in ETGs is mostly due to smooth gas accretion (e. g. cooling from the hot halo of galaxies) which takes place after most of the stellar mass of the galaxy is in place and comes misaligned with respect to the stellar component. Galaxies that have accreted most of their cold gas content prior to the time where most of the stellar mass was in place show aligned components.

40|$|MEMS sensors {{have gained}} more {{space in the}} {{industry}} over the last decade. How are compact, lightweight and energy efficient they are being applied to vehicles as cars, planes and satellites, and also in robotic manipulators, joysticks, laptops, cameras and other gadgets. MEMS sensors such as accelerometers, gyros, and magnetometers (MARG sensors) are widely used in navigation applications requiring linear motion estimation and / or angular. Although constantly evolving, these sensors require the maintenance of calibration, especially {{in regard to the}} biases and scale factors which are very sensitive to temperature variation but also the on-off effect. Generally, sensors used in navigation are arranged in triads, presents also alignment errors between the axes to be measured after assembly. The calibration procedure for swing often requires equipment such as positioning tables and robotic arms, which are expensive and can only be made in pre-use, or in the laboratory. This work is progressing on the issue of self-calibration of these types of sensors, showing the equation, simulation and testing of a Kalman Estimator for determining the parameters of the sensors that make up a triad. The algorithm runs in two steps. At first, positioning data of the triad are collected and then applied the Kalman recursive algorithm for determining the constants of the quadratic form designing the readings of the triad in an irregular ellipsoid. Then the algebraic equations that relate the constants of the ellipsoid with the parameters of the sensors are resolved (biases, scale factor and <b>misaligment).</b> Also discussed is a heuristic way to collect data and identify the right time to run the calibration algorithm based on a merit factor observed. The advantage of this algorithm is low computational cost, which allows its implementation and the possibility of onboard equipment to self-recalibrate.

40|$|Evidences {{suggesting}} that bulges of non-barred disk galaxies could be triaxial structures come from different aspects. From the photometry, the twist {{of the inner}} isophotes and the <b>misaligment</b> between the disk and the bulge major axis position angle are not possible under the hypothesis of symmetry for both components. From the kinematics, rotation curves with velocities higher than permitted by circular motions or velocity gradients along the galaxy minor axis {{can be understood as}} signs of triaxiality. If triaxiality is a common feature in bulges, it could have important implications on bulge formation and evolution. Asymmetries in the potential could provide a method of transporting gas into the galaxy center, and therefore must be consider when accounting for fuelling of central starbursts, for the formation of inner rings or for the formation and destruction of bars due to the build up of gas in the galactic center. Following the previous statistical works on bulges triaxiality (Zaritsky & Lo 1986; Bertola et al. 1991), we have used a photometric approach to derive the probability distribution function (PDF) of the intrinsic axis ratios of bulges. In our work, we improve the previous ones in several aspects. First, we use a more extensive (148 galaxies) and better defined sample of non-barred disk galaxies. Second, we use a fully bidimensional code to derive the photometric parameters of galaxies in the sample, using images in the J-band taken from the 2 MASS archive. And third, we determine the PDF using a new method where the geometry of the system is inverted analytically. As a preliminary result, we have found for our sample of bulges that ~ 44 % are close to be oblate ellipsoids, ~ 16 % are close to prolate ellipsoids, ~ 5 % are close to be spheres and the remaining ~ 34 % are definitely triaxial ellipsoids...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} the {{issues associated with}} government programs proposed for the "commercialization" of new energy technologies; these programs are intended to hasten the pace at which target technologies are adopted by the private sector. The "commercial demonstration" is the principal tool used in these programs. Most previous government interventions in support of technological change have focussed on R&D and left {{to the private sector}} the decision as to adoption for commercial utilization; thus there is relatively {{little in the way of}} analysis or experience which bears direct application. The analysis is divided into four sections. First, the role of R,D&D within the structure of the national energy goals and policies is examined. The issue or "prices versus gaps" is described as a crucial difference of viewpoint concerning the role of the government in the future of the energy system. Second, the process of technological change as it occurs with respect to energy technologies is then examined for possible sources of <b>misaligment</b> or social and private incentives. The process is described as a series of investments. Third, correction of these sources of misalignment then becomes the goal of commercial demonstration programs as this goal and the means for attaining it are explored. Government-supported commercialization may be viewed as a subsidy to the introduction stage of the process; the circumstances under which such subsidies are likely to affect the success of the subsequent diffusion stage are addressed. The discussion then turns to the political, legal, and institutional problems. Finally, methods for the evaluation and planning of commercial demonstration programs are analyzed. The critical areas of ignorance are highlighted and comprise a research agenda for improved analytical techniques to support decisions in this area.
