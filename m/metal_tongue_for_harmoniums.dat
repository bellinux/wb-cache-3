50|$|The morsing {{is firmly}} {{held in the}} hand, the frame or the ring between the palm and the fingers usually in the left hand. Care {{should be taken to}} see that the middle part or the <b>metal</b> <b>tongue</b> is not being touched when held idle. Then the upper of the two {{parallel}} forks is firmly pressed against the front upper teeth; the lower fork, against the front lower teeth with the lips helping to keep the contact, so that the <b>metal</b> <b>tongue</b> will not contact the teeth when it moves. The trigger is plucked with the tip of the index finger. Sound is produced due to the vibration of the <b>metal</b> <b>tongue</b> thath is transferred through the teeth and sounds in mouth and nasal cavity. Movement of the player's tongue with constant plucking can produce very fast patterns of sound. By constricting the space in the mouth the nostrils can produce sounds in different phases, similar to phasers in electronic music.|$|R

50|$|A {{standard}} screw {{lamp socket}} {{has only two}} electrical contacts. In {{the center of the}} bottom of a standard socket is the hot contact (contact one in photo), which typically looks like a small <b>metal</b> <b>tongue</b> bent over. The threaded metal shell is itself the neutral contact (contact three in photo). When a standard bulb is screwed into a standard socket, a matching contact {{on the bottom of the}} bulb presses against the <b>metal</b> <b>tongue</b> in the center of the socket, creating the live connection. The metal threads of the bulb base touch the socket shell, which creates the neutral connection, and this is how the electrical circuit is completed.|$|R

50|$|Free reed aerophone {{instruments}} are likewise unique since sound {{is produced by}} 'free reeds' - small <b>metal</b> <b>tongues</b> arranged in rows within a metal or wooden frame.

It {{can be categorized}} under lamellophones, {{which is in the}} category of plucked idiophones. It consists of a metal ring {{in the shape of a}} horseshoe with two parallel forks which form the frame, and a <b>metal</b> <b>tongue</b> in the middle, between the forks, fixed to the ring at one end and free to vibrate at the other. The <b>metal</b> <b>tongue</b> is bent at the free end in a plane perpendicular to the circular ring so that it can be struck and is made to vibrate. This bent part is called the trigger.|$|R
