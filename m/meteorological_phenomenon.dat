500|$|The 1985 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season had 6U.S. landfalling hurricanes, {{which was the}} highest number in 99years. The season officially began on June1 and lasted until November30. It was an average season, with 11named storms developing. This was partially attributed to a La Niña [...] a <b>meteorological</b> <b>phenomenon</b> that produces favorable conditions across the Atlantic basin, such as lower wind shear and higher sea surface temperatures. The first storm, Ana, developed on July15 near Bermuda and caused minor effects in Canada while transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Three other tropical cyclones [...] Claudette, Henri, and Isabel [...] did not significantly affect land. Claudette developed offshore of the Southeastern United States and brushed Bermuda and the Azores. Henri and Isabel were dissipating as they approached land.

[...] The Angolan National Institute of Meteorology has placed the cause of the heavy rain with a large equatorial depression which is expected to remain over the country until April when it will start to move southwards.

2500|$|Mahon's report, {{released}} on 27 April 1981, cleared {{the crew of}} blame for the disaster. Mahon said the single, dominant and effective cause of the crash was Air New Zealand's alteration of the flight plan waypoint coordinates in the ground navigation computer without advising the crew. The new flight plan took the aircraft directly over the mountain, rather than along its flank. Due to whiteout conditions, [...] "a malevolent trick of the polar light", the crew were unable to visually identify the mountain in front of them. Furthermore, they may have experienced a rare <b>meteorological</b> <b>phenomenon</b> called sector whiteout, which creates the visual illusion of a flat horizon far in the distance. (It {{appeared to be a}} very broad gap between cloud layers allowing a view of the distant Ross Ice Shelf and beyond.) Mahon noted that the flight crew, with many thousands of hours of flight time between them, had considerable experience with the extreme accuracy of the aircraft's inertial navigation system. Mahon also found that the radio communications centre at McMurdo Station had authorised Collins to descend to , below the minimum safe level.|$|E
2500|$|.....a sudden {{temperature}} inversion {{must have taken}} place. The cold and warm air masses could conceivably propel that rotating air lens in an elliptical orbit first toward the earth, and then push it up, {{as if it were}} a boomerang, back to its original position. Meanwhile the ice crystals in it acted as so many means of refraction for the sun’s rays... Only one observer, a lawyer, stated three decades later that the path of descent and ascent was elliptical with small circles superimposed on it. Such an observation would make eminent sense to anyone familiar with fluid dynamics or even with the workings of a boomerang. There is indeed plenty of scientific information on hand to approach the miracle of the sun scientifically... The carefully co-ordinated interplay of so many physical factors would by itself be a miracle, even if one does not wish to see anything more in what actually happened. Clearly, the “miracle” of the sun was not a mere <b>meteorological</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> however rare. Otherwise it would have been observed before and after, regardless of the presence of devout crowds or not. I merely claim, which I did in my other writings on miracles, that in producing miracles God often makes use of a natural substratum by greatly enhancing its physical components and their interactions.|$|E
2500|$|Maxentius {{organized}} his forcesstill {{twice the}} size of Constantine'sin long lines facing the battle plain, with their backs to the river. Constantine's army arrived at the field bearing unfamiliar symbols on either its standards or its soldiers' shields. According to Lactantius, Constantine was visited by a dream the night before the battle, wherein he was advised [...] "to mark the heavenly sign of God on the shields of his soldiers...by means of a slanted letter X with the top of its head bent round, he marked Christ on their shields." [...] Eusebius describes another version, where, while marching at midday, [...] "he saw with his own eyes in the heavens a trophy of the cross arising from the light of the sun, carrying the message, In Hoc Signo Vinces or [...] "Conquer By This"; in Eusebius's account, Constantine had a dream the following night, in which Christ appeared with the same heavenly sign, and told him to make a standard, the labarum, for his army in that form. Eusebius is vague about when and where these events took place, but it enters his narrative before the war against Maxentius begins. Eusebius describes the sign as Chi (Χ) traversed by Rho (Ρ), or ☧ a symbol representing the first two letters of the Greek spelling of the word Christos or Christ. The Eusebian description of the vision has been explained as a [...] "solar halo", a <b>meteorological</b> <b>phenomenon</b> which can produce similar effects. In 315 a medallion was issued at Ticinum showing Constantine wearing a helmet emblazoned with the Chi-Rho, and coins issued at Siscia in 317/18 repeat the image. The figure was otherwise rare, however, and is uncommon in imperial iconography and propaganda before the 320s.|$|E

Upon the contact of these two air masses characterised by significant thermobaric differences, in the unstable conditions created, a number of dangerous <b>meteorological</b> <b>phenomena</b> took place, manifested in the West of the country in the form of intense lightning, torrential showers, hail and squall. The effects of these dangerous phenomena were numerous: hundreds of hectares of crops compromised; houses, bridges and roads destroyed by floods, hail and wind; trees brought down by squall; localities suffered shortages in electricity or drinking water; buildings caught fire; livestock and domestic animals perished etc. In the following days the dangerous <b>meteorological</b> <b>phenomena</b> caused massive destruction almost everywhere else in the country...|$|R
