5|$|Following World War I (a {{period when}} the Machine Gun Corps was based in the park, as {{referred}} to in Henry Williamson's Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight), the Brownlows, like many of their peers, were faced with mounting financial problems.

Today's drier climate does not provide enough precipitation to recharge the aquifer at the rate at which water is being withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight of}} the Pieds-Noirs dwarfed that of the Muslim harkis who had fought on the French side during the Algerian War.

5|$|A mass {{of granite}} {{now in the}} Panamint Mountains intruded this complex 1400 mya. Pegmatic dikes and other widely spaced plutons of granite {{are also in the}} complex (a pluton is a large blob of magma deep {{underground}} and dikes are projections of that). Outcrops can be seen along the front of the Black Mountains in Death Valley and in the Talc and Ibex Hills. When the granite was being intruded, the west coast of North America ran through Eastern California and through an embayment that spread toward the Las Vegas Valley. This embayment, called the Amargosa aulacogen, had highlands north and south of it and {{was the result of a}} failed rift. <b>Many</b> <b>thousands</b> of feet of sediment filled the slowly subsiding basin.|$|E

5|$|As of 2007, the brewing {{industry}} is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and <b>many</b> <b>thousands</b> of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries.

In 2010, China's beer consumption hit 450 million hectolitres (45 billion litres), or nearly twice that of the United States, but only 5 per cent sold were premium draught beers, compared with 50 per cent in France and Germany.|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{distributed}} in bottles and cans {{and is also}} commonly available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and <b>many</b> <b>thousands</b> of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (abv), although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% abv and above. Beer forms {{part of the culture}} of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games such as bar billiards.|$|E
5|$|Boxwood {{cut across}} the end-grain is hard enough for fine engraving, {{allowing}} greater detail than in normal woodcutting. This been the dominant method used since Bewick's time. In addition, since a wood engraving is inked on the face, it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for <b>many</b> <b>thousands</b> of prints, and importantly can be assembled into a page of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run. In contrast, a copper plate engraving is inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped clean of ink before printing, so much higher pressure is required, and images must be printed separately from the text, at far greater expense.|$|E

5|$|Charles Pearson (1793–1862) had {{proposed}} an underground railway connecting the City of London {{with the main}} line rail termini in around 1840. In 1854 he commissioned the first traffic survey, determining that each day 200,000 walked into the City, 44,000 travelled by omnibus, and 26,000 in private carriages. A Parliamentary Commission backed Pearson's proposal over other schemes. Despite concerns about vibration causing subsidence of buildings, the problems of compensating the <b>many</b> <b>thousands</b> whose homes were destroyed during digging of the tunnel, and fears that the tunnelling might break into Hell, construction began in 1860. On 9January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{concerns}} about vibrations causing subsidence of nearby buildings, {{the problems of}} compensating the <b>many</b> <b>thousands</b> of people whose homes were destroyed during the digging of the tunnel, and fears that the tunnelling might accidentally break through into Hell, construction began in 1860. The new railway was built beneath the existing New Road, running from the Great Western Railway's terminus at Paddington to Farringdon and the meat market of Smithfield. On 9January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway. The MR was successful and grew steadily, extending its own services and acquiring other local railways in the areas north and west of London.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{advocate}} for the <b>many</b> <b>thousands</b> of returned servicemen and women many ex-services organisations sprang up. The most prominent of these was probably the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia which had been established in 1916 by representatives from many state-based organisations already in existence. Following the war this organisation grew in its political influence as its numbers grew and was very active in the repatriation process, advocating for financial entitlements for veterans and securing concessions for soldiers returning to civilian employment. By 1919 it was estimated to have 150,000 members although this fell dramatically in the mid-1920s.|$|E
