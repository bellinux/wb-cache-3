TalkBack restores conversational turn-taking to voicemail retrieval by dividing voice messages into smaller sections based on the most significant silent and filled pauses and pausing after each to record a response. The responses are composed into a reply, alternating with snippets of the original message for context. TalkBack is built into a digital picture frame; the recipient touches a picture of the caller to hear each segment of the message in turn. The <b>minimal</b> <b>interface</b> models synchronous <b>interaction</b> and facilitates asynchronous voice messaging. TalkBack can also present a voice-annotated slide show which it receives over the Internet...|$|R

A major research field within mobile and ubiquitous computing is <b>minimal</b> attention <b>interfaces.</b> At present however, {{there is little}} in the way of validated heuristics to inform the design and implementation of <b>minimal</b> attention user <b>interfaces.</b> A paradigmatic example of a challenging mobile interaction task is physical navigation.

The initial focus of this research is to investigate the use of spatial audio as an element in a <b>minimal</b> attention <b>interface</b> to provide usable and meaningful navigation cues in one or more common navigational contexts.

Introduction A COMPUTER AIDED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING tool (or CASE tool) is a drawing tool used to produce and manage diagrams representing a software system's design. A CASE tool typically embodies the definitions {{of one or more}} software development methodologies. The tool allows a designer to enter diagrams in the method's notation, checks the diagrams for consistency, and may generate code or produce diagrams from pre-existing code. Unfortunately, providing information to a CASE tool often serves to subvert the design process. For example, Jim Coplien [3] recommends that key [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{promotion}} of membrane fusion by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) requires {{an interaction between}} the viral hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) proteins, although the mechanism by which this interaction regulates fusion is not clear. The NDV HN protein exists as a tetramer composed {{of a pair of}} dimers. Based on X-ray crystallographic studies of the NDV HN globular domain (S. Crennell et al., Nat. Struct. Biol. 7 : 1068 - 1074, 2000), it was proposed that the protein undergoes a significant conformational change from an initial structure having minimal intermonomeric contacts to a structure with a much more extensive dimer interface. This conformational change was predicted to be integral to fusion promotion with the <b>minimal</b> <b>interface</b> form required to maintain F in its prefusion state until HN binds receptors. However, no evidence for such a conformational change exists for any other paramyxovirus attachment protein. To test the NDV model, we have engineered a pair of intermonomeric disulfide bonds across the dimer interface in the globular domain of an otherwise non-disulfide-linked NDV HN protein by the introduction of cysteine substitutions for residues T 216 and D 230. The disulfide-linked dimer is formed both intracellularly {{and in the absence of}} receptor binding and is efficiently expressed at the cell surface. The disulfide bonds preclude formation of the <b>minimal</b> <b>interface</b> form of the protein and yet enhance both receptor-binding activity at 37 °C and fusion promotion. These results confirm that neither the <b>minimal</b> <b>interface</b> form of HN nor the proposed drastic conformational change in the protein is required for fusion...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores <b>interface</b> <b>interactions,</b> topology of spin structures, {{and the use}} of <b>interface</b> <b>interactions</b> in {{manipulating the}} topology of spin structures. First, I will present our work on <b>interface</b> <b>interactions</b> in magnetic thin film heterostructures. A majority of interesting phenomena in magnetic heterostructures are caused primarily by the <b>interface</b> <b>interactions.</b> In exchange bias system CoO/MgO/Fe/Ag(001), the role of frozen and rotatable antiferromagnetic spins in exchange bias system was investigated using X-ray Magnetic Linear Dichroism (XMLD). In the Py/FeMn/Ni/Cu(001) system, the indirect coupling through an antiferromagnetic spacer layer was studied through anisotropy measurements using Rotating-Field Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (ROTMOKE). Second, I will present our work on artificial topological spin structures. Traditionally, research on nanostructured magnetic materials has focused on the study of uniformly magnetized thin films. With the increasing capability to prepare and manipulate non-uniform spin configurations in recent years, various topological spin structure have been realized. In magnetic thin films, magnetic vortex states can be stabilized by reducing the lateral dimension of the magnetic thin film to the nanoscale due to the increased shape anisotropy. By combining this shape anisotropy and interlayer exchange coupling at the interface, we showed that more complex topological spin structures such as spin skyrmions and hedgehog spin merons can be stabilized and manipulated. By utilizing uniaxial strain in a ferroelectric-ferromagnetic system Co/Cu/PMN-PT(011), we demonstrated a method to manipulate the circulation of a magnetic vortex state using strain...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{trend in}} {{interactive}} modeling of 3 D shapes {{from a single}} image is designing <b>minimal</b> <b>interfaces,</b> and accompanying algorithms, for modeling a specific class of objects. Expanding upon the range of shapes that existing <b>minimal</b> <b>interfaces</b> can model, we present an interactive image-guided tool for modeling shapes made up of extruded parts. An extruded part is represented by extruding a closed planar curve, called base, in the direction orthogonal to the base. To model each extruded part, the user only needs to sketch the projected base shape in the image. The main technical contribution is a novel optimization-based approach for recovering the 3 D normal of the base of an extruded object by exploring both geometric regularity of the sketched curve and image contents. We developed a convenient interface for modeling multi-part shapes and a method for optimizing the relative placement of the parts. Our tool is validated using synthetic data and tested on real-world images.

40|$|Abstract Secure initial {{pairing of}} {{electronic}} gadgets is a challenging problem, especially considering {{lack of any}} common security infrastructure. The main security issue is the threat of so-called Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks, whereby an attacker inserts itself into the pairing protocol by impersonating one of the legitimate parties. A number of interesting techniques have been proposed, all of which involve the user in the pairing process. However, they are inapplicable to many common scenarios where devices to-be-paired do not possess required interfaces, such as displays, speakers, cameras or microphones. In this paper, we introduce BEDA (Button-Enabled Device Association), a protocol suite for secure pairing devices with <b>minimal</b> user <b>interfaces.</b> The most common and <b>minimal</b> <b>interface</b> available on wide variety of devices is a single button. BEDA protocols can accommodate pairing scenarios where one (or even both) devices only have a single button as their “user interface”.
