Most decompression <b>models</b> <b>will</b> take this to be at six tissue half-times for the slowest tissue considered. Further bottom time at the same depth will not affect the inert gas loading of any tissue and will not affect the decompression required.|$|E
5|$|The Solar updraft tower (SUT) is a renewable-energy {{power plant}} for {{generating}} electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath {{a very wide}} greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall chimney tower. The resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect. This airflow drives wind turbines placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce electricity. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration <b>models</b> <b>will</b> allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.|$|E

25|$|Chapter 2 {{is about}} {{economics}} {{as it has}} been practised in the years leading up to 2009. The author refers to Keynes's view that an over-reliance on maths is a mistake, because mathematical <b>models</b> <b>will</b> always depend on the validity of their underlying assumptions. Skidelsky says that modern mainstream macroeconomics has become closely integrated with maths, {{at the expense of other}} disciplines such as political economy and history, and that this is partly why it became so unreliable at making accurate predictions or offering good advice. Various schools of thought within modern economics are briefly discussed, such as rational expectations, real business cycle theory and efficient market theory.|$|E
25|$|Gödel's {{completeness}} theorem, proved by Kurt Gödel in 1929, establishes {{that there}} are sound, complete, effective deductive systems for first-order logic, and thus the first-order logical consequence relation is captured by finite provability. Naively, the statement that a formula φ logically implies a formula ψ depends on every model of φ; these <b>models</b> <b>will</b> in general be of arbitrarily large cardinality, and so logical consequence cannot be effectively verified by checking every model. However, {{it is possible to}} enumerate all finite derivations and search for a derivation of ψ from φ. If ψ is logically implied by φ, such a derivation will eventually be found. Thus first-order logical consequence is semidecidable: it is possible to make an effective enumeration of all pairs of sentences (φ,ψ) such that ψ is a logical consequence ofφ.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, Edward Lorenz {{discovered}} the chaotic {{nature of the}} fluid dynamics equations involved in weather forecasting. [...] Extremely small errors in temperature, winds, or other initial inputs given to numerical <b>models</b> <b>will</b> amplify and double every five days, {{making it impossible for}} long-range forecasts—those made more than two weeks in advance—to predict the state of the atmosphere with any degree of forecast skill. [...] Furthermore, existing observation networks have poor coverage in some regions (for example, over large bodies of water such as the Pacific Ocean), which introduces uncertainty into the true initial state of the atmosphere. [...] While a set of equations, known as the Liouville equations, exists to determine the initial uncertainty in the model initialization, the equations are too complex to run in real-time, even with the use of supercomputers. [...] These uncertainties limit forecast model accuracy to about five or six days into the future.|$|E
