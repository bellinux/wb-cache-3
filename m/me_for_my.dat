25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E

Two months would make her a mental and physical wreck.|$|E
