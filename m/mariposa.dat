5|$|The California Gold Rush in {{the mid-19th}} century {{dramatically}} increased travel by European-Americans in the area, causing competition for resources between the regional Paiute and Miwok and the miners and hangers on. In 1851 {{as part of the}} <b>Mariposa</b> Wars intended to suppress Native American resistance, United States Army Major Jim Savage led the <b>Mariposa</b> Battalion into the west end of Yosemite Valley. He was pursuing forces of around 200 Ahwahneechee led by Chief Tenaya.|$|E
5|$|Wawona was an Indian encampment {{in what is}} now {{the southwestern}} part of the park. Settler Galen Clark {{discovered}} the <b>Mariposa</b> Grove of giant sequoia in Wawona in 1857. He had simple lodgings built, and roads to the area. In 1879, the Wawona Hotel was built to serve tourists visiting <b>Mariposa</b> Grove. As tourism increased, so did the number of trails and hotels developed by people intending to build on the trade.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, Yosemite Valley and the <b>Mariposa</b> Grove {{of giant}} sequoia trees were {{transferred}} from federal to state ownership. Yosemite pioneer Galen Clark became the park's first guardian. Conditions in Yosemite Valley were made more hospitable {{to people and}} access to the park was improved in the late 19th century. Naturalist John Muir and others became increasingly alarmed about the excessive exploitation of the area. Their efforts helped establish Yosemite National Park in 1890. Yosemite Valley and the <b>Mariposa</b> Grove were added to the national park in 1906.|$|E
5|$|Prior to its {{downloading}} to {{the municipal}} level on April1, 1997, Highway46 {{was a fairly}} straight highway following the north-south lot boundaries of Victoria County, between the fifth and sixth lots of <b>Mariposa</b> Township and {{the second and third}} lots of Eldon Township.|$|E
5|$|Trade between tribes {{became more}} {{widespread}} during the <b>Mariposa</b> phase, and the diet continued to improve. Paiutes, Miwok, and Monos visited {{the area to}} trade; one major trading route went over Mono Pass and through Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake in Eastern California.|$|E
5|$|Milton and Houston Mann {{opened a}} toll road to Yosemite Valley in 1856, up the South Fork of the Merced River. They charged the then {{considerable}} sum of two dollars per person until {{the road was}} bought by <b>Mariposa</b> County, after which it became free.|$|E
5|$|Paiutes {{were the}} primary {{inhabitants}} of the Yosemite area and the foothills to the east during the <b>Mariposa</b> and historic phases. The Central Sierra Miwoks lived along the drainage area of the Tuolumne and Stanislaus Rivers, while the Paiutes inhabited the upper drainage of the Merced and Chowchilla Rivers.|$|E
5|$|Pressure from Starr King and Olmsted, {{photographs}} by Carleton Watkins, and geological {{data from the}} 1863 Geological Survey of California prompted legislators to take action. Senator John Conness of California introduced a park bill in 1864 to the United States Senate to cede Yosemite Valley and the <b>Mariposa</b> Grove of Big Trees to California.|$|E
5|$|The California Gold Rush in the 1850s saw {{gradually}} increasing mining in Merced Canyon and Yosemite Valley. Many Native Americans in {{the area}} revolted, leading to conflicts between miners and the Ahwahnechee. In 1851 the <b>Mariposa</b> Battalion was formed to drive the remaining Ahwahnechee out of the valley into reservations. The Battalion fought an Ahwahnechee group led by Chief Tenaya over the South Fork of the Merced River. Eventually, they succeeded in driving most of the Indians out of the Yosemite Valley, first into a reservation near Fresno. Following the gold rush, the Ahwahnechee were allowed back into Yosemite Valley, but further incidents prompted a second battalion to drive them out, this time to the Mono Lake area. Many place names in the valley have their origin from the <b>Mariposa</b> Battalion.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} three groves of ancient giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) trees; the <b>Mariposa</b> Grove (200 trees), the Tuolumne Grove (25 trees), and the Merced Grove (20 trees). This species grows larger in volume {{than any other}} {{and is one of}} the tallest and longest-lived.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers, which bloom {{mainly in}} the spring and early summer, include pincushions, golden bee plant, dwarf purple monkey flower, and {{sagebrush}} <b>mariposa</b> lily at the Painted Hills Unit. Munro's globemallow, lupines, yellow fritillary, hedgehog cactus, and Applegate's Indian paintbrush are commonly seen at the Clarno and Sheep Rock units.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} Fritillaria species {{are used as}} early spring {{ornamental}} flowers. These vary from the large Fritillaria imperialis (crown imperial) available {{in a number of}} colours such as yellow or orange, to the relatively tiny species such as Fritillaria meleagris or Fritillaria uva-vulpis with their chequered patterns. Erythronium is less common but a popular cultivar is 'Pagoda' with its sulphur yellow flowers. Calochortus (<b>mariposa</b> lily) may be sold as a mixture or as cultivars.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{divide the}} pre-European American contact {{period of the}} region into three {{cultural}} phases. The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000BCE to 500CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl {{and the use of}} grinding stones. The Tarmarack phase lasted from 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating development and use of the bow and arrow. The <b>Mariposa</b> phase lasted from 1200 until contact with European Americans.|$|E
5|$|Bunnell drafted {{an article}} about the trip, but {{destroyed}} it when a newspaper correspondent in San Francisco suggested cutting his 1,500-foot (460m) height estimate for the valley's walls in half; the walls are in fact twice the height that Bunnell surmised. The first published account of Yosemite Valley was written by Lt. Tredwell Moore for the January 20, 1854, issue of the <b>Mariposa</b> Chronicle, establishing the modern spelling of Yosemite. Bunnell described his awestruck impressions of the valley in his book, The Discovery of the Yosemite, published in 1892.|$|E
5|$|Forty-eight Non-Indian people visited Yosemite Valley in 1855, {{including}} San Francisco writer James Mason Hutchings {{and artist}} Thomas Ayres. Hutchings {{wrote an article}} about his experience that {{was published in the}} July 12, 1855, issue of the <b>Mariposa</b> Gazette and Ayres' sketch of Yosemite Falls was published in late 1855; four of his drawings were presented in the lead article of the July 1856 and initial issue of Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine. The article and illustrations created tourist interest in Yosemite and eventually led to its protection.|$|E
5|$|Galen Clark {{retired as}} the state grant's {{guardian}} in 1896, leaving Yosemite Valley and the <b>Mariposa</b> Grove of Big Trees under ineffective stewardship. Pre-existing problems in the state grant worsened and new problems arose, but the cavalry could only monitor the situation. Muir and the Sierra Club continued to lobby the government and influential people {{for the creation of}} a unified Yosemite National Park. The Sierra Club began to organize annual trips to Yosemite in 1901 in an effort to make the remote area more accessible.|$|E
5|$|Hard times {{forced the}} family to {{relocate}} to San Francisco, California when Turner was six years old, and her parents soon separated. On December 14, 1930, her father won some money at a traveling craps game, stuffed his winnings in his left sock, and headed for home. He was later found murdered {{on the corner of}} Minnesota and <b>Mariposa</b> Streets, on the edge of San Francisco's Potrero Hill and the Dogpatch District with his left shoe and sock missing. The robbery and homicide were never solved.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, settler Galen Clark {{discovered}} the <b>Mariposa</b> Grove of giant sequoia at Wawona, an indigenous encampment {{in what is}} now the southwestern part of the park. Clark completed a bridge over the South Fork of the Merced River in 1857 at Wawona for traffic headed toward Yosemite Valley and provided a way station for travelers on the road the Mann brothers built to the valley.|$|E
5|$|Muir and his Sierra Club {{continued}} to lobby {{the government and}} influential people {{for the creation of}} a unified Yosemite National Park. In May 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt camped with Muir near Glacier Point for three days. On that trip, Muir convinced Roosevelt to take control of Yosemite Valley and <b>Mariposa</b> Grove away from California and return it to the federal government. In 1906, Roosevelt signed a bill that did precisely that.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing of meadows (especially by sheep), logging {{of giant}} sequoia, and other damage caused Muir {{to become an}} {{advocate}} for further protection. Muir convinced prominent guests {{of the importance of}} putting the area under federal protection; one such guest was Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine. Muir and Johnson lobbied Congress for the Act that created Yosemite National Park on October 1, 1890. The State of California, however, retained control of Yosemite Valley and <b>Mariposa</b> Grove. Muir also helped persuade local officials to virtually eliminate grazing from the Yosemite high country.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{plants in}} the park include more than 100 grass species, many native to the region. Growing among the grasses are flowering species such as evening primrose, <b>mariposa</b> lily, and blue flax, and shrubs such as sagebrush, saltbush, and rabbitbrush. Among {{the wide variety of}} grasses are native perennial bunchgrass, blue grama, sacaton, sideoats grama, bearded sprangletop, and bush muhly. Invasive species that crowd out slower-spreading natives include annual lovegrass and brome (cheat grass).|$|E
5|$|Yosemite Valley is open year-round and {{numerous}} activities {{are available through}} the National Park Service, Yosemite Conservancy, and Delaware North at Yosemite, including nature walks, photography and art classes, stargazing programs, tours, bike rentals, rafting, mule and horseback rides, and rock climbing classes. Many people enjoy short walks and longer hikes to waterfalls in Yosemite Valley, or walks among giant sequoias in the <b>Mariposa,</b> Tuolumne, or Merced Groves. Others like to drive or take a tour bus to Glacier Point (summer–fall) to see a spectacular view of Yosemite Valley and the high country, or drive along the scenic Tioga Road to Tuolumne Meadows (May–October) {{and go for a}} walk or hike.|$|E
5|$|Concerned by {{the effects}} of {{commercial}} interests, prominent citizens including Galen Clark and Senator John Conness advocated for protection of the area. A park bill was prepared {{with the assistance of}} the General Land Office in the Interior Department. The bill passed both houses of the 38th United States Congress, and was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on June 30, 1864, creating the Yosemite Grant. This is the first instance of park land being set aside specifically for preservation and public use by action of the U.S. federal government, and set a precedent for the 1872 creation of Yellowstone as the first national park. Yosemite Valley and the <b>Mariposa</b> Grove were ceded to California as a state park, and a board of commissioners was proclaimed two years later.|$|E
25|$|From 2003 to 2013, the {{district}} covered parts of Fresno, Madera, <b>Mariposa,</b> Tuolumne, and Stanislaus counties.|$|E

25|$|Yosemite Valley {{was first}} {{protected}} {{by the federal government}} in 1864. The Valley and <b>Mariposa</b> Grove were ceded to California in 1866 and turned into a state park. John Muir perceived overgrazing by sheep and logging of Giant Sequoia to be a problem in the Sierra. Muir successfully lobbied {{for the protection of the}} rest of Yosemite National Park: Congress created an Act to protect the park in 1890. The Valley and <b>Mariposa</b> Grove were added to the Park in 1906. In the same year, Sequoia National Park was formed to protect the Giant Sequoia: all logging of the Sequoia ceased at that time.|$|E
25|$|In dry summer weather, the Scugog River {{ceases to}} flow {{out of the}} lake, and its {{tributary}} streams of <b>Mariposa</b> Brook and East Cross Creek flow backward into the lake via the river to offset the high evaporative losses off the lake and marsh surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Muir escorted President Theodore Roosevelt through Yosemite in 1903, and {{two years}} later the California {{legislature}} ceded Yosemite Valley and <b>Mariposa</b> Grove to the federal government. The Sierra Club won its first lobbying victory with the creation of the country's second national park, after Yellowstone in 1872.|$|E
25|$|On October 29, 2015, it was {{announced}} that Melissa will star in the El Rey program Lucha Underground and would be making her debut in the upcoming tapings for the promotion's second season. She made her debut on March 9, 2016 episode, under a mask and the ring name <b>Mariposa,</b> portraying Marty Martinez's sister.|$|E
25|$|John Muir, now {{president}} of the Sierra Club, appointed Lukens to the Club committee of Publications & Communications and directed him to write articles and speak about government-owned toll roads and of California relinquishing both Yosemite Valley and the <b>Mariposa</b> Grove of Big Trees to the federal government, which were then under state management.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, Joseph Bates and Hiram Edson, hiked {{the length}} of Canada West from the St. Lawrence River to Toronto. They sought out fellow Millerites in order to teach them about the Sabbath. In a letter written from Toronto on New Year's Day, 1852, Bates {{describes}} their journey through knee deep snow. They made stops at <b>Mariposa,</b> Skewgog Lakes and Reach. Over twenty people decided to observe the Seventh-day Sabbath.|$|E
