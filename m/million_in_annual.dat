The apparently favourable saving of £1,175,000 was made much of on the Irish side, but more than matched what the British would have gradually lost over the 47 years, if the value was discounted on the Time value of money basis.

5|$|Although the {{original}} financing {{plan called for}} a 50-cent toll increase on the Dulles Toll Road to finance the Silver Line (25 cents at the main plaza and 25 cents at the ramp plazas), the increase in projected costs resulted in the MWAA Board approving {{an increase in the}} surcharges. Effective January 1, 2010, the fare surcharge was increased to 50 cents at both the main plaza and ramp plazas, with additional 25-cent increases in main-plaza tolls set for 2011 and 2012. These toll surcharges are designed to support MWAA's 52.6% share of the projected $5.25 billion combined cost of Phase I and Phase II. MWAA has justified these toll increases as necessary to meet an estimated $220 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>annual</b> debt-service costs projected by 2020. These toll revenue requirements were {{based on the assumption that}} the federal government, although it contributed $900 million to Phase I, would not contribute funds for Phase II.|$|E

5|$|Attalea {{species have}} a long history of human utilisation. Carbonised Attalea maripa seeds have been found in archaeological sites in Colombia dating back to 9000 BP. A variety of species remain {{important}} sources of edible oil, thatch, edible seeds and fibre. The leaves of Attalea butyracea and A.maripa are used extensively for thatching. Several species are oil palms, with A.speciosa among the most important economically. Products extracted from A.speciosa were reported to support over 300,000 households in the Brazilian state of Maranhão in 2005, and in 1985 it was estimated to support over 450,000 households throughout the Brazil. Piassava fibres, extracted from the leaf bases of A.funifera, are commercially important, and generated about US$20 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>annual</b> income to Brazilian farmers in 1996.|$|E
5|$|By 1989, {{the airline}} had 156 {{employees}} and 150,000 annual passengers. On 9 February 1989, Norsk Air's board {{decided to start}} the termination process if a sale was not made. The employees agreed to cut their wages 10 percent and not take sick days during the sales process. One of the main difficulties in the sales process was that Widerøe {{could not afford to}} purchase Norsk Air's hangar at the airport. Widerøe intended to continue operations at both Torp and Geiteryggen for a year to see where to establish its base. In fear that the airline would move to Skien, the municipalities of Sandefjord and Stokke, who owned the majority of the airport, agreed to purchase the hangar, which had been built for NOK20 million in 1987, for NOK11.5 million. Half the hangar would be rented to Widerøe for NOK500,000 per year. This was insufficient to cover the NOK1.2 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>annual</b> interest costs.|$|E
5|$|On December 24, 2014, the PTC {{announced}} it was going forward with plans to replace the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. Six options are being considered, three of which would include building bypasses via rock blasting (like what {{was done with the}} Laurel Hill Tunnel) while the other three would include boring two new tunnels, presumably three lanes each to accommodate the PTC's long-term plans to widen the entire mainline turnpike to six lanes except at the existing tunnels. If the PTC goes through with building new tunnels, the existing Allegheny Mountain Tunnels would be shut down. Although the projected costs for building a bypass would be {{less than half of the}} projected costs to bore new tunnels (as well as $3 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>annual</b> maintenance on each tunnel), the aforementioned hunting group opposes the bypass options. Funding has not been identified for the project, which would open to traffic in a best-case scenario in the early 2020s.|$|E

5|$|The first mall to {{be opened}} in College Station, Post Oak is the largest mall within the Brazos Valley area. At its opening, it became the city's largest employer, and nearly doubled its city sales tax revenues. Though the mall {{generated}} additional traffic and added to the demand on city services, it also generated $1 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>annual</b> sales tax revenue, $120,000 in property taxes, and a half-million in taxes for the city school district. It is credited with creating the first major impetus for growing economic and commercial developments for College Station, which previously lacked a major retail community. The mall generates over 75 percent of the area's retail sales through its approximately eleven million annual visitors. It remains the city's largest taxpayer and its second largest employer. It is also the top employer of the students of nearby Texas A University.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its opening, it was the largest mall complex {{developed}} by CBL. In the first year, it was projected that the mall would employee 2,500 employees—instantly making it the largest employer in the city; this was expected to expand to 3,500 with the completion of the second phase. It was hoped it would generate $80 million in sales. In addition to helping to retain local shoppers who might otherwise travel the 2½ hours southeast to Houston for mall shopping, CBL and city officials expected the mall would draw shoppers from around the Brazos Valley. Before its opening, the city did not have a highly developed retail community. With the planned additions, then College Station city manager North Bardell said it was expected to generate $1 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>annual</b> sales tax revenue, nearly equal to what the city collected in the previous fiscal year from all other sales. It would bring in another $120,000 in property taxes, a half-million in taxes for College Station Independent School District, and $1 million in electric bills. The increase in jobs was seen as good for the community, and the city hoped it would attract new civic groups to the area. Taking a year longer than originally planned, the expansion was completed in 1985.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds signed {{agreements}} {{with the rest of}} the Big Three automotive manufacturers, several major insurers, General Electric and others. In 1986 the company acquired National Medical Computer Services and a business forms company called Arnold Corporation. By the end of that year, Reynolds had more than $200 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>annual</b> revenue, 42 percent of which came from business forms. Reynolds acquired several smaller technology companies in the 1990s and further developed its software products.

From 1994 to 1996, David Holmes led the acquisition of several other business forms and computer businesses outside the automotive industry for a total of $155 million. By 2000, Reynolds and Reynolds had revenues of $800 million and more than one-third of its users were General Motors dealerships.
