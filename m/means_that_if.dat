5|$|Released (19.1.0.28) on September 6, 2011, Norton Internet Security 2012 {{brought new}} {{features}}. One {{of the new}} features included in the new release is Download Insight 2.0, which not only monitors files for safety but also the stability of a given file. That <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a file is stable on Windows 7, but unstable on Windows XP, XP users will be notified of the file's instability.|$|E
5|$|Rule 90 and Rule 102 {{are called}} {{additive}} cellular automata. This <b>means</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> two initial states are combined by computing the exclusive or of each their states, then their subsequent configurations will be combined {{in the same}} way. More generally, one can partition any configuration of Rule 90 into two subsets with disjoint nonzero cells, evolve the two subsets separately, and compute each successive configuration of the original automaton as the exclusive or of the configurations on the same time steps of the two subsets.|$|E
5|$|The Stamford Bridge freehold, the pitch, the {{turnstiles}} and Chelsea's {{naming rights}} are {{now owned by}} Chelsea Pitch Owners, a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the club moves to a new stadium, {{they may have to}} change their name.|$|E
5000|$|... "Love and {{betrayal}} co-exist. It doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you betrayed {{the one you}} love, you love him less. Nor does it <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you love someone, you will not betray him…" [...] (Yi Jing to herself)" ...|$|R
25|$|Some {{commentators}} have interpreted this to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the President says {{you are an}} enemy combatant, then you effectively are.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you <b>mean</b> <b>that?</b> <b>If</b> <b>that's</b> true you robbed us, you thief, robbed us {{cold and}} clean." [...] He sprang up. [...] "I knew you'd do something----" ...|$|R
5|$|Rights of {{a person}} arrested under {{ordinary}} circumstances is laid down in {{the right to life}} and personal liberty. No one can be arrested without being told the grounds for his arrest. If arrested, the person has the right to defend himself by a lawyer of his choice. Also an arrested citizen has to be brought before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours. The rights {{of a person}} arrested under ordinary circumstances are not available to an enemy alien. They are also not available to persons detained under the Preventive Detention Act. Under preventive detention, the government can imprison a person for a maximum of three months. It <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the government feels that a person being at liberty can be a threat to the law and order or to the unity and integrity of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person to prevent him from doing this possible harm. After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{technical}} {{reason for this}} difficulty is that the frequency response of a simple filter approaches a fall of 6 dB/octave far {{from the point of}} resonance. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> telephone channels are squeezed in side-by-side into the frequency spectrum, there will be crosstalk from adjacent channels in any given channel. What is required is a much more sophisticated filter that has a flat frequency response in the required passband like a low-Q resonant circuit, but that rapidly falls in response (much faster than 6dB/octave) at the transition from passband to stopband like a high-Q resonant circuit. Obviously, these are contradictory requirements to be met with a single resonant circuit. The solution to these needs was founded in the theory of transmission lines and consequently the necessary filters did not become available until this theory was fully developed. At this early stage the idea of signal bandwidth, and hence the need for filters to match to it, was not fully understood; indeed, it was as late as 1920 before the concept of bandwidth was fully established. For early radio, the concepts of Q-factor, selectivity and tuning sufficed. This was all to change with the developing theory of transmission lines on which image filters are based, as explained in the next section.|$|E
25|$|Completeness, which <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{a formula}} is true, {{it can be}} proven, i.e. is a theorem of the system.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we {{are going}} to admit this Quixotic motive in de Mountford's {{attitude}} now, there can only be one mainspring for it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{property}} we can derive is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> [...] is valid, then [...] This {{does not}} <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> [...] is true, then agent i knows [...] What it <b>means</b> is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> [...] {{is true in}} every world that an agent considers to be a possible world, then the agent must know [...] at every possible world. This principle is traditionally called N.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it {{does not}} matter enough, one had better not do it at all. I don't know if you are right--I think you are." ...|$|R
25|$|This also <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the {{consumer}} is indifferent between A and B and is indifferent between B and C she will be indifferent between A and C.|$|E
25|$|This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{capital outlay}} is involved, this capital sits {{for a longer}} time when air drying is used. On the other hand, installing, {{operating}} and maintaining an industrial kiln is expensive.|$|E
25|$|Geometrically, {{condition}} T(q) essentially <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> D is {{a reduced}} van Kampen diagram over (∗) then every interior vertex of D of degree {{at least three}} actually has degree at least q.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh it won't be murder," [...] said Mrs. Brook. [...] "I <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Harold, {{in one way}} and another, {{keeps her}} along, she won't get off." ...|$|R
6000|$|She just hesitated. [...] "I <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{she comes}} to see me I shall--now that I've pulled myself round a bit after the shock--not be at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet, I daresay," [...] {{suggested}} Robina, [...] "that if one {{put it into}} a book--I <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you {{put it into a}} book, {{it would}} read amusingly." ...|$|R
25|$|This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{conifers}} {{are considered}} a division, they may be called Pinophyta or Coniferae. As a class they may be called Pinopsida or Coniferae. As an order they may be called Pinales or Coniferae or Coniferales.|$|E
25|$|This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you dialyze {{a patient}} to a Kt/V of 1.23, and measure the postdialysis and predialysis urea {{nitrogen}} levels in the blood, then calculate the URR, then -ln (1-URR) should be about 1.23.|$|E
25|$|<b>Means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> A and B are in {{all respect}} {{identical}} the consumer will consider A {{to be at least}} as good as (i.e. weakly preferred to) B. Alternatively, the axiom can be modified to read that the consumer is indifferent with regard to A and B.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the torngak {{you were}} going to get for me is no better than your own, he is a fool, and I would rather not have him." ...|$|R
3000|$|... (n) before {{filtering}} (lower {{groups of}} curves in Figure 3). The Spearman rank correlation factors for these arrays Rk Spare {{within the limits}} 0.8... 0.9. Positive values <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it were {{to occur}} to you to offer me a little {{sacrifice}} on your own side it might place the matter in a slightly more attractive light." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{identity}} test basically <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> prices {{remain the}} same and quantities remain in the same proportion to each other (each quantity of an item is multiplied by the same factor of either , for the first period, or , for the later period) then the index value will be one.|$|E
25|$|This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{the winner}} had {{remained}} undefeated throughout the group {{stage of the}} tournament, they would have won a total of $4,245,000 (winner's prize plus $45,000 for each group stage win), while a team eliminated in the group stage without any wins would have gotten $35,000.|$|E
25|$|A more {{rigorous}} statement {{is that with}} respect to exchange of two identical particles the total wave function is antisymmetric for fermions, and symmetric for bosons. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the space and spin co-ordinates of two identical particles are interchanged the wave function changes its sign for fermions, and does not change for bosons.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish {{we could}} have it out now," [...] replied the other, firmly. [...] "Do you really <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you came to think me right, you would be {{certainly}} wrong?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you mean--can you mean, Bertha?" [...] he said, {{in a low}} tone. [...] "Do you <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I ask you {{the same}} {{question}} again you will give me a different answer?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Does <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{one partner}} {{says there is}} such a {{prospect}} reasonable prospect of reconciliation, the court is then obliged to deny a divorce? <b>If</b> it doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>that,</b> then you have unilateral divorce against the will of the other person ...|$|R
25|$|All three passing loop {{tracks are}} on the {{southwest}} side of the main running line – this is in general the downhill side, where the mountain slopes away from the line. This <b>means</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> required, the line could be easily be converted to double track without the need to cut into the rock face to widen the formation.|$|E
25|$|As a body, the seventy in the LDS Church are {{considered}} to be equal in priesthood authority with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. This presumably <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the apostles were killed or incapacitated, the seventy could take over the function of the apostles. However, in such circumstances, the seventy would be required to act unanimously.|$|E
25|$|Graphically, non-rivalry <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> each {{of several}} {{individuals}} has a demand curve {{for a public}} good, then the individual demand curves are summed vertically to get the aggregate demand curve for the public good. This {{is in contrast to}} the procedure for deriving the aggregate demand for a private good, where individual demands are summed horizontally.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it {{had been}} you would have managed by this time {{to catch a glimpse}} of her? I didn't fear things then," [...] I added. [...] "I hadn't the same reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mean!" [...] said Davie, [...] "why, I <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{you touch}} me I'll resign office; and <b>if</b> I do <b>that,</b> you'll {{have to go}} out, for {{everyone}} knows you can't get on without me." ...|$|R
2500|$|A Midrash {{interpreted}} Pharaoh's exclamation in [...] "Can we {{find such}} a one as this?" [...] to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{they went to the}} end of the world, they would not find another one like Joseph.|$|R
