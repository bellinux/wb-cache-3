5|$|In August the UN {{also began}} using Korean civilians with A-frames as cargo {{carriers}} to move supplies {{up through the}} <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> the front lines. This method of transport proved both cheaper and more efficient than using pack animals. American units obtained the civilian carriers through arrangements with the ROK Army. Soon the American divisions were using Korean labor for nearly all unskilled work, {{at an average of}} about 500 laborers and carriers to a division.|$|E
5|$|In November, Herring flew {{across the}} <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> {{take control of}} the {{fighting}} around Buna, leaving Blamey to control operations elsewhere in New Guinea.

5|$|On May31, 2013, a {{prominent}} mid-to-upper level trough and closed mid-level {{low pressure area}} moved east-northeastward, with a lead upper low pivoting over the Dakotas and Upper Midwest region. A moderately strong polar jet moved east-northeastward over the southern Rocky <b>Mountains</b> <b>to</b> the southern Great Plains.

5|$|Presently {{the only}} major streams {{entering}} the basin come from <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> the west and northwest, but during the Pleistocene they likely transported more water. When lower sea levels entrenched a more southerly course of the Colorado River, Lake Cahuilla may have been nourished solely by local runoff during the Wisconsin glaciation.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} in 1987 of a primitive tomb at Mondeval de Sora {{high up in}} the <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> the south of Cortina testifies to the presence of Mesolithic man in the area {{as far back as the}} 6th millennium B.C. In the 6th century B.C., Etruscan writing was introduced in the province of Cadore, in whose possession is remained until the early 15th century. From the 3rd century B.C., the Romans assimilated the Veneti people, giving the area the name of Amplitium (from amplus meaning wide), today's Ampezzo.|$|E
5|$|The land {{on which}} Worlds End State Park sits has {{undergone}} tremendous change over the last 350million years. It was once part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion {{of what is now}} North America. The high <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today in the Loyalsock Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, conglomerates, coal, and limestone.|$|E
