40|$|We {{consider}} a game between two capacity providers that compete for customers through a broker {{who works on}} commissions and sells to both loyal and non-loyal customers. The capacity providers compete by selecting commission margins and sales thresholds at which commissions on all sales increase. We show that in equilibrium, contracts require positive sales thresholds. The threshold requirement can be best described as a mechanism for one provider to profit {{at the expense of}} the other. For exogenous commission margins, we show that it is the provider with the lower margin who benefits from thresholds {{at the expense of the}} broker. However, the gains for the lower <b>margin</b> <b>provider</b> can be a mirage in full equilibrium, where commission margins are endogenous...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cloud {{computing}} is {{a highly}} scalable and cost-effective infrastructure for running HPC, enterprise and Web applications. However, the growing demand of Cloud infrastructure has drastically increased the energy consumption of data centers, {{which has become a}} critical issue. High energy consumption not only translates to high operational cost, which reduces the profit <b>margin</b> of Cloud <b>providers,</b> but also leads to high carbon emissions which is not environmentally friendly. Hence, energy-efficient solutions are required to minimize the impact of Cloud computing on the environment. In order to design such solutions, deep analysis of Cloud is required with respect to their power efficiency. Thus, in this chapter, we discuss various elements of Clouds which contribute to the total energy consumption and how it is addressed in the literature. We also discuss the implication of these solutions for future research directions to enable green Cloud computing. The chapter also explains the role of Cloud users in achieving this goal. 1...|$|R

While the operational costs incurred by cloud providers are dynamic they vary over time, depending on factors such as energy cost, cooling strategies, and overall utilization the pricing models extended to customers are typically fixed they are static over time and independent of aggregate demand. This disconnect between the cost incurred by a provider and the price paid by a customer results in an inefficient marketplace. In particular, it does not provide incentives for customers to express workload scheduling flexibilities that may benefit {{them as well as}} cloud providers. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic pricing model that aims to address this marketplace inefficiency by giving customers the opportunity and incentive to take advantage of any tolerances they may have regarding the scheduling of their workloads. We present the architecture and algorithmic blueprints of a framework for workload colocation, which provides customers with the ability to formally express workload scheduling flexibilities using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), optimizes the use of cloud resources to collocate clients’ workloads, and utilizes Shapley valuation to rationally and thus fairly in a game-theoretic sense attribute costs to customer workloads. In a thorough experimental evaluation we show the practical utility of our dynamic pricing mechanism and the efficacy of the resulting marketplace in terms of cost savings.

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{maximize}} the profit, a service provider should understand both service charges and business costs, {{and how they}} are determined by the characteristics of the applications and the configuration of a multi server system. The problem of optimal multi server configuration for profit maximization in a cloud computing environment is studied. Our pricing model takes such factors into considerations as the amount of a service, the workload of an application environment, the configuration of a multi server system, the service-level agreement, the satisfaction of a consumer, the quality of a service, the penalty of a low-quality service, the cost of renting, the cost of energy consumption, and a service <b>provider’s</b> <b>margin</b> and profit. Our approach is to treat a multi server system as an M/M/m queuing model, such that our optimization problem can be formulated and solved analytically. Two server speed and power consumption models are considered, namely, the idle-speed model and the constant-speed model. The probability density function of the waiting time of a newly arrived service request is derived. The expected service charge to a service request is calculated. The expected net business gain in one unit of time is obtained. Numerical calculations of the optimal server size and the optimal server speed are demonstrate...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the spring}} of 2009, Dutch {{mortgage}} rates have been structurally high, both {{in comparison to the}} rest of Europe and to funding costs. This article reviews the debate on possible causes, which are of two types: (1) the higher mortgage rates reflect higher funding costs, and (2) softer competition has allowed higher price-cost <b>margins</b> for mortgage <b>providers.</b> Detailed <b>margin</b> calculations based on an established cost formula reveal that, while funding costs have risen substantially since the financial crisis, they do not fully explain the high mortgage rates relative to very low base rates. Instead, there have been competition concerns in Dutch mortgage banking since the financial crisis, particularly a high market concentration of established banks, exit of several foreign challengers, a remarkable restriction of competition through price-leadership bans imposed by the European Commission on three of the four largest mortgage providers, and funding capacity constraints that in part have resulted from tightened banking regulation. We conclude that, while several of the developments discussed combined to create market conditions rife for margin increases through coordination, the European Commission's price leadership bans appear to have acted as a nucleus for the crystallization of high mortgage rates in {{the spring of}} 2009...|$|R

To maximize the profit, a cloud service provider should understand both service charges and business costs, and how they are gritty by the characteristics of the applications and the configuration of a multi-server system. The problem of optimal multi-server arrangement for profit maximization in a cloud computing environment is studied. The pricing model takes such factors into considerations as the amount of a service, the workload of an application location, the formation of a multi-server system, the service-level agreement, the satisfaction of a consumer, the quality of a service, the disadvantage of a low-quality service, the cost of renting, and the cost of energy depletion, and a service <b>provider’s</b> <b>margin</b> and profit.

40|$|The use of High Performance Computing (HPC) in {{commercial}} and consumer IT applications is becoming popular. They need {{the ability to}} gain rapid and scalable access to high-end computing capabilities. Cloud computing promises to deliver such a computing infrastructure using data centers so that HPC users can access applications and data from a Cloud {{anywhere in the world}} on demand and pay based on what they use. However, the growing demand drastically increases the energy consumption of data centers, which has become a critical issue. High energy consumption not only translates to high energy cost, which will reduce the profit <b>margin</b> of Cloud <b>providers,</b> but also high carbon emissions which is not environmentally sustainable. Hence, energy-efficient solutions are required that can address the high increase in the energy consumption from the perspective of not only Cloud provider but also from the environment. To address this issue we propose near-optimal scheduling policies that exploits heterogeneity across multiple data centers for a Cloud provider. We consider a number of energy efficiency factors such as energy cost, carbon emission rate, workload, and CPU power efficiency which changes across different data center depending on their location, architectural design, and management system. Our carbon/energy based scheduling policies are able to achieve on average up to 30 % of energy savings in comparison to profit based scheduling policies leading to higher profit and less carbon emissions...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Importance: Insurers {{have adopted}} new {{reimbursement}} policies for diagnosing and treating {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA) using home sleep testing (HST) instead of laboratory-based strategies. Objective: We conducted an economic analysis of the HomePAP study, a multi-center randomized clinical trial that compared home-based versus lab-based testing for the diagnosis and management of OSA. Design: A cost-minimization analysis from the payer and provider perspectives was performed, given that 3 month clinical outcomes (acceptance, adherence, and functional status) were equivalent for the home and laboratory arms. 2011 Medicare price weights {{were used for the}} payer perspective. HomePAP sites submitted itemized cost estimates for the provider perspective. Setting: Seven academic sleep centers. Participants: 373 subjects at high risk for moderate to severe OSA were randomized to either home-based limited channel portable monitoring followed by unattended auto-titration with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), versus a traditional pathway of in-laboratory sleep study and CPAP titration. Main outcome measure: Per-subject costs, as randomized, in US Dollars. Results: From the payer perspective, per subject costs for the lab-based pathway were $ 2, 124 (95 % C. I. $ 1, 948, $ 2, 308) compared to $ 1, 874 (95 % C. I. $ 1, 724, $ 2, 020) for the home-based pathway under the base case. Costs were $ 250 (95 % C. I. $ 10, $ 494, p= 0. 04) in favor of the home arm. From the provider perspective, per subject costs for the lab arm were $ 1, 940 (95 % C. I. $ 1, 801, $ 2, 079) compared to $ 1, 992 (95 % C. I. $ 1, 870, $ 2, 123) in the home arm, for a difference of $ 51 (95 % C. I. -$ 235, $ 142, p= 0. 59) in favor of the lab arm under the base case. Differences in payer and provider costs resulted in a <b>provider</b> operating <b>margin</b> of $ 184 (95 % C. I. $ 126, $ 244, p< 0. 001) in the lab arm compared to a loss of $ 118 (95 % C. I. -$ 159, -$ 77, p< 0. 001) in the home arm. Conclusions and Relevance: For payers, a home-based diagnostic pathway for OSA with robust patient support incurs fewer costs than a lab-based pathway, but has comparable if not higher costs for providers, resulting in a negative operating <b>margin</b> for <b>providers.</b> This analysis shows the need to ensure that cost savings under HST are sustainable without potentially compromising patient care...|$|R
