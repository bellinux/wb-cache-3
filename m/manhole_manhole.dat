40|$|Abstract Our {{goal is to}} {{rank the}} {{electricity}} service structures (<b>manholes</b> and service boxes) in Manhattan according to their vulnerability to serious <b>manhole</b> events such as <b>manhole</b> fires, explosions and smoking <b>manholes.</b> <b>Manhole</b> event prediction is a new application for machine learning, and we started this project with {{a large amount of}} data from several disparate sources, most of which is extremely noisy. Our data includes Con Edison ECS (Emergency Control System) trouble tickets, which are records of past events affecting the secondary (low voltage) electric distribution system such as a <b>manhole</b> fire, <b>manhole</b> explosion, smoking <b>manhole,</b> no-light event, low voltage event, flickering light event, side-off partial outage, or burnout. We describe our approach to dealing with this challenging dataset, involving a combination of targeted information extraction, statistics, and feature and label development for machine learning. Our efforts have resulted in a streamlined bipartite ranking model that is aimed at predicting future <b>manhole</b> events. This model has demonstrated promising results on a “blind” prediction test. The overall goal of our system is to assist Con Edison to prioritize the inspection of over 50, 000 <b>manholes</b> and service boxes in Manhattan and to prioritize long-term follow-up repair works.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{visualization}} framework for analyzing the Consolidated Edison Company of New York (Con Edison) trouble {{tickets for the}} Manhattan electrical distribution system. The Con Edison Emergency Control System (ECS) is a work management tool that documents all events {{that occur in the}} electrical distribution system. The trouble ticket generated from ECS is a record of an event affecting the secondary (low-voltage) electrical distribution system, such as a <b>manhole</b> fire, <b>manhole</b> explosion, smoking <b>manhole,</b> no-light event, flickering light event, side-off partial outage, or burnout. The visualization tool outlined here is used alongside our preliminary statistical and machine learning work for predicting future <b>manhole</b> events. ECS tickets stored in our PostgreSQL database are displayed using Google Earth’s satellite images of Manhattan as a backdrop. The ability of this tool to display events relative to the surrounding buildings has already yielded some highly promising directions for our ongoing analysis...|$|R
40|$|The large {{variations}} in the inflows together with the complex operation of Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) systems may result in flow conditions that vary from dry to free surface flow to partly free surface-partly pressurized flow (mixed flow), to fully pressurized flow. Transitions from one flow regime to another are governed by flow instabilities (Yen 1986). Some of these instabilities may produce undesirable events such as geysering phenomena, blow-off of <b>manhole</b> covers, <b>manhole</b> overtopping or structural damage of the system. In order to asses {{the impact of these}} undesirable events a transient analysis of these systems for various scenarios becomes important...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a model for a sewer network coupled to surface flow and {{investigate}} it numerically. In particular, we present a new model for the <b>manholes</b> in storm sewer systems. It is derived using the balance of the total energy in the complete network. The resulting system of equations contains, aside from hyperbolic conservation laws for the sewer network and algebraic relations for the coupling conditions, a system of ODEs governing the flow in the <b>manholes.</b> The <b>manholes</b> provide natural points for the interaction of the sewer system and the run off on the urban surface modelled by shallow water equations. Finally, a numerical method for the coupled system is presented. In several numerical tests we study the influence of the <b>manhole</b> model on the sewer system and the coupling with 2 D surface flow. 1. Introduction. Man...|$|R
500|$|In 1988, {{brothers}} Rand and Robyn Miller {{were living}} {{apart in the}} United States. Robyn was taking a year off from university, writing and trying to establish state residency. Rand was a computer programmer for a bank. Rand approached his brother {{with the idea of}} making an interactive storybook using HyperCard. The brothers were not big video game players themselves, although they were familiar with Dungeons & Dragons, and had played Zork. In his parents' basement—Robyn did not own a computer himself—Robyn began drawing pictures and creating a nonlinear story that would eventually become their first game, The <b>Manhole.</b> The <b>Manhole</b> and the games that followed—Cosmic Osmo and Spelunx—were specifically aimed at children and shared the same aesthetics: black-and-white graphics, point-and-click gameplay, a first-person point of view, and explorable worlds. Robyn recalled that the games were more about exploration than narrative: [...] "In the projects we did for children, we didn't really tell stories [...] They were just these worlds that you would explore." ...|$|R

The EJ product line includes <b>manhole</b> frames and <b>manhole</b> covers, utility castings for the telecommunications industry, trench grates, tree grates, detectable warning plates, airport and design specific castings, monument boxes, meter boxes, valve boxes, drainage grates, curb inlets, and catch basins.

60|$|Passing {{along the}} tunnel, he removed several shaft coupling-bolts and -nuts, {{scattering}} other and ancient pieces of iron underfoot. Cylinder-bolts he {{cut off to}} the number of six from the after-engine cylinder, so that it might match its neighbour, and stuffed the bilge - and feed-pumps with cotton-waste. Then he made up a neat bundle of the various odds and ends that he had gathered from the engines - little things like nuts and valve-spindles, all carefully tallowed - and retired with them under the floor of the engine-room, where he sighed, being fat, as he passed from <b>manhole</b> to <b>manhole</b> of the double bottom, and in a fairly dry submarine compartment hid them. Any engineer, particularly in an unfriendly port, has a right to keep his spare stores where he chooses; and the foot of one of the cylinder shores blocked all entrance into the regular store-room, even if that had not been already closed with steel wedges. In conclusion, he disconnected the after-engine, laid piston and connecting-rod, carefully tallowed, where it would be most inconvenient to the casual visitor, took out three of the eight collars of the thrust-block, hid them where only he could find them again, filled the boilers by hand, wedged the sliding doors of the coal-bunkers, and rested from his labours. The engine-room was a cemetery, and it did not need the contents of the ash-lift through the skylight to make it any worse.|$|R

40|$|Works (DPW) and a 51 year-old male {{volunteer}} firefighter (Victim II) of {{the village}} Fire Department (FD) died after entering a sewer <b>manhole.</b> The <b>manhole</b> was located behind the fire house. The Fire Chief and a firefighter were called in by the DPW general foreman (GF) to unlock the firehouse and move the fire truck so {{it would not be}} blocked by the DPW utility truck while working at the <b>manhole.</b> Victim II also arrived to offer assistance. The <b>manhole</b> was five feet in diameter and 18 feet deep with an opening 24 inches in diameter (see photo). Victim I started climbing down the metal rungs on the <b>manhole</b> wall wearing a Tyvek suit and work boots in an attempt to clear a sewer blockage. The DPW GF, the firefighter and Victim II walked over to observe. They saw Victim I lying on the <b>manhole</b> floor motionless. They speculated that he had slipped and fallen off the rungs and injured himself. The Fire Chief immediately called for an ambulance. Meanwhile, Victim II entered the <b>manhole</b> to rescue Victim I without wearing any respiratory protection. The firefighter saw that Victim II fell off the rungs backwards while he was half way down and informed the Fire Chief. The Fire Chief immediately called for a second ambulance and summoned the village FD to respond. The FD responders arrived within minutes. The Assistant Fire Chief (AFC) donned a self-contained breathing apparatus. He could not go through the <b>manhole</b> opening with the air cylinder on his back. The cylinder was tied to a rope that wa...|$|R
