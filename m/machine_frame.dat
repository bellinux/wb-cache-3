50|$|There {{are three}} parts to an {{electromagnetic}} brake: field, armature, and hub (which is the input on a brake) (A-3). Usually {{the magnetic field}} is bolted to the <b>machine</b> <b>frame</b> (or uses a torque arm that can handle the torque of the brake). So when the armature is attracted to the field the stopping torque is transferred into the field housing and into the <b>machine</b> <b>frame</b> decelerating the load. This can happen very fast (.1-3sec).|$|E
50|$|Electro-mechanical disk brakes operate via {{electrical}} actuation, but transmit torque mechanically. When {{electricity is}} applied to the coil of an electromagnet, the magnetic flux attracts the armature to the face of the brake. As it does so, it squeezes the inner and outer friction disks together. The hub is normally mounted on the shaft that is rotating. The brake housing is mounted solidly to the <b>machine</b> <b>frame.</b> As the disks are squeezed, torque is transmitted from the hub into the <b>machine</b> <b>frame,</b> stopping and holding the shaft.|$|E

To carry the weight of the <b>machine,</b> <b>frame</b> mounts and footings are required. When the field winding is excited by DC excitation, brushes and slip rings are required to connect to the excitation supply. The field winding can also be excited by a brushless exciter.

In some machines or when a large number of poles are needed, a salient pole rotor is used.The construction of synchronous motor {{is similar to that of}} a synchronous alternator.|$|E
50|$|After the war, Conn {{returned}} to Elkhart {{and established a}} grocery and baking business. He also played cornet in the local community band. Conn's entrance into the musical instrument manufacturing business {{was the result of}} a split lip. There are three existing stories of how this occurred, but the popularly accepted version is that Del Crampton slugged him in the mouth outside a saloon where both of them had been drinking. Conn's upper lip was severely lacerated, and it pained him so to play his cornet that he thought his playing days were over. In addition to running his store, Conn also made rubber stamps and re-plated silverware. He decided to try adhering rubber stamp material to the rim of a mouthpiece which he hoped would conform to his lips. After he showed his friends his idea, he realized that there was tremendous demand for his invention. Conn then began to contemplate manufacturing his new mouthpiece. He needed a rim with a groove which the rubber cement would adhere to more easily. It was in 1874 when Conn converted a discarded sewing <b>machine</b> <b>frame</b> into a simple lathe and started to turn out his mouthpieces and was soon in full production (Subsequently, Conn and Del Crampton became best of friends, and when Conn embarked on his political career, he was a staunch advocate of temperance).|$|E

40|$|Stiffness {{modeling}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} significant issues in the design of parallel kinematic machine (PKM). This paper presents a semi-analytical approach that enables the stiffness of PKM with complex <b>machine</b> <b>frame</b> geometry to be estimated effectively. This approach can be implemented by three steps: (i) decomposition of the entire system into two sub-systems associated with the parallel mechanism and the <b>machine</b> <b>frame</b> respectively; (ii) stiffness modeling of each sub-system using the analytical approach and the finite element analysis; and (iii) generation of the stiffness model of the entire system by means of linear superposition. In the modeling process of each sub-system, the virtual work principle and overall deflection Jacobian are employed with special attention to the bending rigidity of the constrained passive limb and the interface stiffness of the <b>machine</b> <b>frame.</b> The stiffness distribution of a 5 -DOF hybrid robot named TriVariant-B is investigated as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach. The contributions of component rigidities to that of the system are evaluated using global indices. It shows that the results achieved by this approach have a good match to those obtained through finite element analysis and experiments. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{approach}} for reusable and adaptable <b>machine</b> tool <b>frames</b> is the modularization {{of the frame}} structure by breakdown to hexagonal primitives. The design of small light weight modules allows for the assembly of a high variation of different geometries and enables scalable structures.
