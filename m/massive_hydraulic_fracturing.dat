40|$|This study characterizes an {{extremely}} large gas resource located in low permeability, sandstone reservoirs of the Mesaverde {{group in the}} Piceance Basin, Colorado. Total in place resource is estimated at 307. 3 Tcf. Via application of geologic, engineering and economic criteria, the portion of this resource potentially recoverable as reserves is estimated. Those volumes estimated include probable, possible and potential categories and total 5. 8 Tcf as a mean estimate of recoverable gas for all plays considered in the basin. About 82. 6 % of the total evaluated resource is contained within sandstones that have extremely poor reservoir properties with permeabilities considered too low for commerciality using current frac technology. Cost reductions and technology improvements {{will be required to}} unlock portions of this enormous resource. Approximately 2. 7 % of the total resource is contained within sandstone reservoirs which do not respond to <b>massive</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> treatments, probably due to their natural lenticular nature.

50|$|The {{combination}} of horizontal drilling and multistage <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracturing</b> was pioneered in Texas’ Austin Chalk {{play in the}} 1980s. Stephen Holdich, head of the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University, commented: “In fact, the Austin Chalk is the model for modern shale development methods.” The Austin Chalk play started in 1981 with vertical wells, but died with {{the decline in the}} oil price in 1982. In 1983, Maurer Engineering designed the equipment to drill the first medium-range horizontal well in the Austin Chalk. Horizontal drilling revived the play by increasing production, and lengths of the horizontal parts of the wellbores grew with greater experience and improvements in drilling technology. Union Pacific Resources, since absorbed by Anadarko Petroleum, entered the Austin Chalk play in a major way in 1987, and drilled more than a thousand horizontal wells in the Austin Chalk, with multistage <b>massive</b> slickwater <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> treatments, making major improvements in drilling and fracturing techniques.|$|R
40|$|Continuous, low-permeability, fractured, organic-rich gas shale {{units are}} {{widespread}} and are possible geologic storage targets. The Marcellus could {{act as a}} storage reservoir for captured CO 2. In this scenario, Marcellus could provide favorable CO 2 adsorption as well as available pore space from <b>massive</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> treatment. One of the key components of a CO 2 -Enhanced Gas Recovery and Storage (CO 2 -EGR&S) process is considering the impact of sorption isotherms. The isotherm represents the thermodynamic limit of how much carbon dioxide or methane {{can be stored in}} shale at a given pressure. In this paper, a shale gas simulation model is developed and history matching process is performed for multi stage/clusters hydraulically fractured horizontal wells in Marcellus shale. Before starting the injection process, both wells that are already history matched are continuing their production to reach to the point that one of the production wells, {{which is going to be}} converted to an injection well, produces 75 % of its accessible gas. The history matched and depleted simulation model is then used to perform the sensitivity analysis in order to identify the impact of both methane and carbon dioxide sorption isotherms on cumulative methane production, total injected CO 2 and CO 2 breakthrough time and molar density of methane and CO 2 changes in both producer and injector and also a monitoring well in between.

40|$|Successful {{exploitation}} of unconventional resource plays {{relies on the}} <b>massive</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures</b> which provide high conductive paths and large contact area between formation and wellbore. The pursuit of efficiency and cost savings drives the industry to implement the strategies that utilize more closely spaced <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures,</b> as well as multiple horizontal wells with reduced spacing, to maximize the production from unconventional reservoirs with ultra-low permeability. One rising challenge from this trend {{is to find the}} optimized spacing between fracture clusters, fracture stages, and fractured horizontal wells so that the potential fracture interference could be minimized. This interference could occur at different scales within lifecycle of exploration, from stress interference in completion stage to pressure interference in production stage. Thus, to systematically study these issues, both geomechanical model and reservoir model are required. In this dissertation, a finite element based geomechanical model and a fast marching based reservoir model are customized to address these emerging problems in unconventional reservoir development. First, we present a comprehensive study of various factors that affect the performance of refracturing operation, such as fracturing spacing, permeability, proppants and refracturing time, by using a cohesive zone finite element based model that can capture the effect of depletion on fracture propagation. The well performance are evaluated under two different refracturing designs: refracturing new or existing perforations. Based on the simulation results, their respective suitability have been concluded. Second, we integrate fracture propagation, reservoir flow and wellbore hydraulics to evaluate the stress shadow effect and efficiency of limited entry perforations during multiple simultaneous fracture propagation within a single fracture stage. Simulation results provide insights to the selection of operational parameters such as cluster spacing, number of clusters and perforations, which can be modified accordingly to deal with the fracture interference and thus promote the uniform stimulation in the formation. Last, to study the production interference between wells, on top of current fast marching based reservoir simulation workflow, we proposed an approach to extend its applicability from transient to boundary-dominated flow regime, as well as a new partition method to identify the respective drainage volume of individual well. This partition criterion utilizes asymptotic pressure solution and results in a good approximation to the conventional streamline tracing method. The supremacy of numerical efficiency has been further demonstrated with numerical experiments...|$|R
40|$|<b>Massive</b> {{multistage}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracturing</b> using horizontal wells {{has been}} {{an integral part of}} the natural resource industry in Canada. The process uses long horizontal wells divided into many stages to access large volumes of oil and gas bearing formations. Each well is divided into fracture stages. Fluids are pumped down into each stage of the well to generate a fracture which increases the porosity and permeability of the formation to allow economic resource extraction. The in situ geomechanical stresses of the formation do not remain static during the fracturing of the rock. Each fracture creates a volume change within the formation which in turn leads to alteration of the stress and strain conditions within the rock mass. There is the possibility that the alteration of stress conditions will have an effect on the initiation and propagation of subsequent stages of the multi-stage <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> operation. This phenomenon is known as ‘stress shadowing’. Stress shadowing occurs when the minimum compressive stress in the formation is increased due to the fracturing of the rock. Increasing the minimum compressive horizontal stress can have several effects, including the rotation or diversion of fracture propagation, stages that do not initiate, thinner fractures, and reduced porosity and permeability within the fracture stage. Currently, many <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> operations do not invest in advanced mathematical models of geomechanics. Some pressure monitoring is carried out during operations, but the data are inadequate to warrant advanced numerical methods to predict stress change and its effects. This thesis presents a semi-analytical solution for the stresses around an ellipsoid (the Eshelby Solution) for use in predicting fracture geometry and stress shadow effects. The program is quick to use and can be linked to field data. A study of field data from the Montney Formation is presented. The algorithm developed in this thesis is used to evaluate stress changes within the Montney Formation and the outputs are compared to the stress changes seen in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> pressure data...|$|R
