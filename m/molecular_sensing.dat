Mesoporous gold sponges are attractive materials for <b>molecular</b> <b>sensing</b> by Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), for catalysis, and for fuel cell construction. The following approach is “green” because PEG Thiol is biocompatible, and because it requires relatively little energy; PEG Thiol-triggered self-assembly of mesoporous gold sponges occurs at room temperature.

Comparative developmental and genetic studies of these pharyngeal structures between hemichordates and urochordates have brought about important insights regarding the evolution of the deuterostome body plan. [...] Comparative molecular biology has revealed that the Pax1/9 genes (which encode for transcription factors) are expressed in similar patterns between hemichordates and urochordates; In vertebrates, Pax 1 and Pax 9 are expressed in the pharyngeal pouches and are important for thymus development. [...] applying excess retinoic acid (excess retincoic acid in vertebrates results in pharyngeal abnormalities) leads to the absence of gill slits in developing Amphioxus, suggesting that retinoic acid may act through the same mechanism in vertebrates and amphioxus.

This two part series focuses on novel dynamical and thermodynamical aspects of Isabel’s inner-core structure on 13 September. In part I, using {{a composite of}} dropwindsonde and in-situ aircraft data, the authors suggested that the axisymmetric structure of Isabel showed that the storm was superintense,. Mesocyclones seen clearly in satellite imagery within the eye of Hurricane Isabel are hypothesized to mix high entropy air at low levels in the eye into the eyewall, stimulating explosive convective development and a concomitant local horizontal wind acceleration. Part II focuses on {{a unique set of}} observations into an extraordinary small- (miso-) scale cyclonic feature inside of the inner edge of the eyewall of Hurricane Isabel.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to examine the}} stress response of wild type Arabidopsis thaliana to treatment with different sodium chloride concentrations. Previous research has shown that sodium chloride induces a stress response from plants in both a physical <b>sense</b> and <b>molecular</b> <b>sense.</b> The hypothesis was that the plants would exhibit a number of different stress responses including shorter root length and an increased production in specific stress- responsive proteins. The hypothesis was tested by placing germinated Arabidopsis seedlings onto MS (Murashige and Skoog) agar plates with varying sodium chloride concentrations. While the seedlings grew on the plates with sodium chloride, root length was measured. After root length measurements were completed, specific plants from each concentration were subjected to protein analysis through SDS-PAGE to compare the banding patterns of protein expression for each treatment group versus the control. The importance {{of this study was to}} better understand how plants tolerate different levels of sodium chloride. Root length analysis showed that higher concentrations of sodium chloride dramatically inhibited a plant’s growth. SDS-PAGE analysis showed a protein band that was present in the control plants and was not present in the plants that grew in an added concentration of sodium chloride. These results show that the plants have specific stress responses to sodium chloride including shorter root length and a decrease in the production of an unkown protein...|$|R

In this contribution, we compared the results of two microarray methods targeting 18 S rDNA and 18 S rRNA with the results obtained from microscopy, HPLC and flow cytometry. On a qualitative basis, the microarrays showed similar or potentially better performance than the non-molecular methods. Quantitatively, our data suggest that microarray signals obtained from 18 S rDNA provide relatively rough estimates of phytoplankton abundance.
