40|$|Extracts of Citri reticulatae pericarpium (PCR) are {{commonly}} used in the Traditional Chinese Medicine. The quality control of PCR is currently performed by single marker analysis, which can hardly describe the complexity of such natural samples. In this study, a fingerprint methodology for PCR based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed and validated. A total of 69 fingerprints of authenticated PCR samples, commercial PCR samples, <b>mixed</b> <b>peel</b> samples, and other Citrus peels were recorded. Exploratory data analysis allowed optimizing the extraction procedure and detecting <b>mixed</b> <b>peel</b> samples. Once the optimizations were performed and the method validated, discrimination between the authentic PCR samples and all other samples was performed by p-Discriminant Partial Least Squares. The established model was able to differentiate between classes with a high reliability for each sample. Furthermore, evaluation of the score and loading plots of the model indicated nobiletin, tangeretin, naringin and hesperidin as important markers for the quality control of PCR. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Green {{banana flour}} shows good {{potential}} as a functional ingredient for special-purpose foods, {{but there are no}} data in the literature concerning the use of a green banana pulp and peel flour for the development of products such as pasta. The aim {{of the present study was}} to develop tagliatelle pasta substituting the wheat flour with different concentrations of a green banana <b>mixed</b> pulp and <b>peel</b> flour. The pasta formulations were prepared replacing the wheat flour by the green banana <b>mixed</b> pulp and <b>peel</b> flour in two concentrations: 15 % and 30 %. A control formulation with wheat flour was also prepared. The green banana <b>mixed</b> pulp and <b>peel</b> flour presented higher ash, total fibre and total phenolic compound contents than traditional wheat flour. The pasta formulation with the addition of 15 % green banana flour showed the highest ash content and the best sensory acceptability of all the formulations.

40|$|Proteins {{isolated}} from sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas) {{have been shown}} to possess antidiabetic, antioxidant, and antiproliferative properties. The objective {{of this study was to}} chemically optimize a process for extracting proteins from sweet potato peel. The extraction procedure involved <b>mixing</b> <b>peel</b> with saline solvent to dissolve proteins and then precipitating with CaCl 2. Quadratic and segmented models were used to determine the optimum NaCl concentration and peel to solvent ratio to maximize protein solubility while minimizing solvent usage. A segmented model was also used to optimize the concentration of CaCl 2 used for precipitation. The highest yield was obtained by mixing blanched peelings with 59. 7 mL of 0. 025 mM NaCl per g peel and then precipitating with 6. 8 mM CaCl 2. The results of this study show that potentially valuable proteins can be extracted from peel generated during processing of sweet potatoes and industrial costs can be minimized by using these optimum conditions...|$|R

5000|$|Pé de moleque (...) (literally [...] "boy's foot" [...] in Portuguese) is a {{traditional}} candy from the Brazilian cuisine made of peanuts and jaggery or molasses. The origin of its name {{lies in the fact}} that most paved streets of colonial Brazil were made by laying down various odd rocks in a loose layer of sand, and having street children stomp on them to flatten the surface. While cobblestone streets are called rua de paralelepípedos and unpaved streets rua de barro (literally, [...] "clay street"), those made by the method described above came to be named pé de moleque. Since the appearance of the peanuts stuck together by molasses was found to be similar to that of these type of street, the candy took the same name.The candy is prepared by <b>mixing</b> roasted, <b>peeled</b> peanuts with melted brown sugar or rapadura, with or without the addition of macerated peanuts as well. The mixture is gently stirred over low heat until it gets close to crystallizing. Then the mixture is placed on a plain stone or metal surface (preferably thinly oiled with butter to ease removal) in pieces similar in size to cookies. This traditional preparation results in soft, irregularly-shaped sweets of a dark brown color. Softness results from the incorporation of peanut oil.|$|R
5000|$|Results were <b>mixed,</b> and the <b>Peel</b> Group {{began looking}} for an outside {{investor}} for Peel Airports. In June 2010 {{it was announced that}} Vantage Airport Group (formerly Vancouver Airport Services) had bought a 65% shareholding in Peel Airports, while the Peel Group retained the remaining 35%. The new management team at Peel Airports quickly began disposing of assets, selling them back to the Peel Group. First to go was Durham Tees Valley Airport in February 2012. Sale of the loss-making DTVA resulted in a one-off impairment charge of £8.8m, causing Peel Airports' losses to rise from £3.2m to £11.4m. The same year, Doncaster Sheffield Airport made an operating loss of £3.4m (down from £3.7m the previous year), and in December 2012 it was announced that this airport had also been sold back to the Peel Group.|$|R

40|$|Biobeds {{developed}} in Sweden bind and degrade pesticides from point sources. The {{objective of this}} work was to adapt the biobed to Italian operating conditions, for example, to identify organic materials as effective {{as those in the}} original Swedish composition. The capacity of urban and garden composts alone or <b>mixed</b> with citrus <b>peel</b> or straw to degrade chlorpyrifos and its metabolite TCP was compared to the typical Swedish biomix consisting of straw, peat, and soil. A tendency for higher 14 C-chlorpyrifos mineralization and lower TCP levels was observed in the biomixes with garden compost alone or amended with straw. In a second trial, a high correlation of lower TCP with increasing levels of straw in typical Swedish biomixes was observed. Straw stimulates production of lignin-degrading enzymes such as manganese peroxidase (MnP), and further trials with pure MnP showed that this enzyme degrades TCP. Materials with an active lignin-degrading microflora are a prerequisite for effective dissipation of chlorpyrifos and non-accumulation of TCP. Thus, lignocellulosic materials as straw and garden composts should be present in biomixes to be used under Italian conditions...|$|R
40|$|Fermentation {{is one of}} {{bioconversion}} {{to produce}} profitable anaerobic microbes and to produce various enzymes. Lipases and cellulases are widely used enzymes so far. Cellulases {{play an important role}} in bioconversion of organic waste cellulosic materials to glucose, single cell proteins, animal feed, and ethanol. Lipases can also degrade fatty ester bond. Therefore, both enzymes are potential to be used in industry as well as in households. Fermentation of fruit peel waste is an attempt to produce cellulase and lipase that can be carried out in a simple way. Cellulase as says was performed using DNS (3. 5 -dinitrosalicylic acid) and acid-base titration for analysis of lipase using cooking oil as the substrate. The results showed that the highest cellulase activity was obtained from watermelon rind mixed with citrus fruit peel of 0. 036 U/mL, and <b>mixed</b> of banana <b>peel</b> and citrus fruit, which was 0. 035 U/mL. The optimum lipase activity was at 30 oC, pH 7, and reaction time of 60 minutes. The highest lipase activity (1. 36 U/mL) was obtained from mixture of watermelon and orange rind. Thus, the fruit peel waste is potential to produce cellulase and lipase by fermentation...|$|R
40|$|Production of L-lactic acid using {{cultures}} of Rhizopus oligosporus and Lactobacillus plantarum was investigated. Cassava peels were hydrolyzed by boiling for 1 h in either NaOH or HCl solutions followed by neutralization to a pH of 6. 2. Reducing sugar produced from the hydrolysates increased with increasing concentrations of alkali or acid. Samples hydrolyzed with HCl produced a maximum reducing sugar concentration of 402 mg/g substrate while alkali hydrolyzed samples produced a maximum reducing sugar concentration of 213 mg/g substrate. Hydrolysates were amended with 0. 5 % {{ammonium sulphate solution}} and inoculated with either single or mixed {{cultures of}} Rhizopus oligosporus and Lactobacillus plantarum and incubated for 48 h for lactic acid production.

40|$|Background: Warfarin is an {{effective}} oral anticoagulant which exert its effect by blocking the utilization of vitamin K. Warfarin therapy requires ongoing monitoring using the international normalized ratio (INR). In this study, effect of modest increase in vitamin K intake from vegetables on INR values was evaluated in warfarin treated patients. Methods: A single-center study involving 24 outpatients (mean age, 62 years) with two last INR in therapeutic range in which INR variations was less than 0. 5. Patients were selected based on their VKORC 1 1639 G→A polymorphism so that 8 patients from each of GG, AA or GA genotypes were recruited. Patients were asked to consume a vegetable <b>mix</b> (including lettuce, <b>peeled</b> cucumber and tomato) containing approximately 100 µg vitamin K (divided in two meals, lunch and dinner) daily for one week when INR response was measured. Results: Daily consumption of vegetable mix decreased patient’s INR from 2. 43 ± 0. 51 to 2. 08 ± 0. 46 (P< 0. 001). INR value had {{a significant decrease in}} each VKORC 1 genotypes (from 2. 55 ± 0. 55 to 2. 21 ± 0. 54 in GG, 2. 35 ± 0. 33 to 2. 00 ± 0. 25 in AA, and   2. 39 ± 0. 65 to 2. 00 ± 0. 25 in GA) but the values did not differ between genotypes. Conclusions: Daily increase in vegetable salad containing approximately 100 µg, decreased INR of patients. Therefore, avoiding variation in consumption of foods with even moderate content of vitamin K could help to prevent INR fluctuations in warfarin treated patients. </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{chemical}} compositions of the vermicomposting materials had {{effect on}} {{the duration of the}} process. The pH and the organic carbon contents were above the minimum recommended values for organic fertilizers. Co-vermicomposting of cattle manures with orange peel or filter cake also resulted in a lower C/N ratio. Co-vermicomposting of cattle manure resulted in higher contents of macronutrients, like N (up to 120  days of vermicomposting). The N content was below the minimum value but the C/N ratio was in the required range. The C/N values where lower in OP + CM and FC + CM piles than in CM pile. Further, the N contents of the piles were different, with OP + CM having the highest value. The micronutrient values in the matured piles decreased in some piles and increased in others. Ca, Mg, Mn and Fe contents significantly increased at the post-vermicompost than the pre-vermicompost for all treatments. The mature FC + CM differed very significantly in the content of Cr due to increased earthworm activity suggesting the bioaccumulation of Cr by the earthworms. It was observed that vermicomposts from filter cake and orange <b>peel</b> <b>mixed</b> with cattle manure resulted in a better vermicomposts than the ones produced from cattle manure only. Thus, it is recommended that these agricultural wastes can be co-vermicomposted and utilized for sustainable agriculture. The vermicomposts so obtained attend the needs of the Brazilian legislation and the vermicomposting could be introduced as efficient technology to convert wastes of cattle manure with orange peel and filter cake into organic fertilizer. Further studies are also been carried out on the potential of vermicomposted orange peels to reduce pest incidence in soil.|$|R
40|$|Potato cyst {{nematodes}} (PCN), Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida, {{are major}} constraints to potato production. They are distributed passively with soil adhering to farm machinery and harvested tubers, {{but also by}} waste soil from trading and processing plants. Inundation is considered an environmentally save method for disinfestation of waste soil. We investigated if agro-industrial waste products accelerate this disinfestation process by studying PCN survival, hatching and infectivity over time. Experiments were conducted in 2 -L containers filled with 1. 5 L non-amended soil, soil amended with steamed or fresh potato peels, calcium sulphate, steamed potato <b>peels</b> <b>mixed</b> with calcium sulphate, or leek leaves. In each container, cysts of G. rostochiensis or G. pallida were buried in the soil in retrievable bags and 400 ml water was added. Non-amended and non-inundated soils were the controls. It took 8 weeks of inundation of non-amended soil to reduce nematode survival by 72 %, while in amended soils survival was reduced up to 99. 9 % after 4 weeks. After 1 week, fewer second-stage juveniles (J 2) hatched and infected roots in inundated amended soil than in inundated non-amended soil. Host finding ability of surviving J 2 was not affected. To understand mechanisms of nematode suppression, concentrations of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), gases (O- 2, CO 2, H 2 S, CH 4, and N- 2) and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were determined. Higher concentrations of SCFA and carbon dioxide {{and lower levels of}} oxygen were detected in amended treatments. H 2 S was occasionally detected in the leek-amended soil.

5000|$|Many Art critics, {{writers and}} Art historians {{have written about}} Solangi’s work, since his first solo {{exhibition}} ‘Sufficient Grounds’, there are various publications that covered Solangi’s work. Aasim Akhtar wrote: 'What makes his work so unique is its combination of rigorous structural control with the humanistically expressive power of colour. In this duality one may perhaps find a lingering reminiscence of the opposition between the language of pure ornament and the anthropocentric ideal of the perfectly proportioned figure. His work is typified by the artistic adaptation of visual experience from everyday life, which often serves as his initial source of inspiration. Thus the {{point of departure for}} a painting may be a reference to an architectural detail - a section of a façade, or an ancient dry-stone wall - or some other found element. These fragments of reality are then formally encoded and endowed with a new and specifically artistic dignity via the use of colour.' He further writes: 'A master of elision, Solangi lets the part stand for the whole in his graphic paintings that feature overlapping fragments of landscape, ellipses and drapes. The effect is dreamlike yet not quite surreal. Solangi’s work captures a world of ruin and decay where the urban debris <b>mixes</b> with <b>peeling</b> paint to suggest forms of foreboding beauty. His paintings imply landscape, but the elements are abstracted, manipulated, and disconnected: Solangi’s colour choices and compositional balance are often exquisite. But he overthinks his material, and his reworkings sometimes give the work an air of hesitancy.' Nafisa Rizvi writes:'Aqeel Solangi traverses the three essential landscapes upon which the blueprint of the universe as we experience it is sustained - the sensory, the terrestrial and the celestial. There are several familiar territories in his paintings like dark clouds looming over faltering shelters and unfamiliar, fantastical ones like cacti floating through inundated bridges. But they all point to the fragility and transience of human experience and the aspiration for divine sustenance. These are not just grandiloquent statements that the artist uses as esoteric formulae for visual production.'Marjorie Husain writes: 'In his work Solangi has mastered the complex processes by which an artist views the world; the system of signs and symbolic forms, a sense of place, art and beauty, and the grandeur and beauty of the natural world. Evident in his work is Solangi’s interest in the sublime aspects of nature, often appearing as a hymn of praise.The artist has walked a determined and often difficult path to follow his muse, and one finds the joy and humility of true creativity in his work. In his youth, the closest art activity found in his hometown in Sindh was the painter of signs and cinema hoardings, so as has been the case with several of the country’s most distinguished artists, he attached himself to those painters.'Dr Akbar Naqvi writes: 'While speaking of Solangi’s skill as a painter, which is what he is rather than a philosopher or historian of culture, his observation strikes one. Be it an apple, a kashkol or its versions as an empty cup or an oyster shell or periwinkles, what looks like shredded paper as an abstract collage, are painted with minute details, as if Solangi had training as a miniature painter. It is the multiplicity of details, including heavy and light brush strokes in some paintings, which designs his contrapuntal paintings and increases their scope. His uninhibited use of eclectic technique, including pasting papers and painting them over as a variation of collage, ought to be commended. Solangi has reached a stage where his own works challenge him to improve further while negotiating with two styles and cultures, while remaining firmly rooted not just in Sindh, but Pakistan.' [...] He further writes: 'Solangi’s painting or imagistic assemblage, as modern and contemporary as it can be, in which he uses various media and techniques, is dynamic without being kinetic art or action painting. It incorporates a paradox in which disconnection connects and movement is still with strong undercurrents and cross-currents below the surface. In the artist’s painting each is all and all each, a new permutation and combination of design in which geometry and numbers set up a new discourse of craft/art, and the self.' ...|$|R
