Akhmatova's Requiem in Russian finally appeared in book form in Munich in 1963, the whole work not published within USSR until 1987. Her long poem The Way of All the Earth or Woman of Kitezh (Kitezhanka) was published in complete form in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Tatsuguchi reached Rabaul on October 4, 1942. His {{stay there}} was {{probably}} short, for his wife recorded that he joined her in Tokyo that same month prior to being redeployed. Tatsuguchi was unable to tell his wife, now pregnant with their second child, {{where he would be}} assigned, but she noticed that he studied maps of the North Pacific area.

5|$|Four British {{transports}} were considered: the Blackburn Beverley, Bristol 179B, Bristol 195 and Short PD 16/1. The mission also {{assessed the}} American Fairchild C-119G Flying Boxcar, Fairchild C-123 Provider and Lockheed C-130A Hercules. Of these types, the mission assessed that the Beverley, C-123 and C-130 could potentially meet the RAAF's requirements. Following further {{consideration of the}} options after their return to Australia, in early 1955 {{the members of the}} mission unanimously recommended that Hercules be procured, as the other two types did not <b>meet</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most important elements of the requirement. At this time the Australian Government was reluctant to fund any new equipment for the RAAF, and a decision to acquire twelve C-130s was not made until mid-1957. A contract for these aircraft was signed in October that year. The Australian C-130As were to be similar to those in service with the United States Air Force (USAF), the main difference being the use of TF56-A-11 engines in the place of the usual TF56-A-1 and TF56-A-9s; these engines provided almost the same power, but were modified to meet Australian fuel requirements. The total cost for the aircraft, initial crew training and support equipment was $US36 million (equivalent to about 16 million Australian pounds).|$|E
5|$|Blaine {{gives in}} to Kurt's urgings and wishes and {{transfers}} to McKinley High {{so they can}} spend more time together during Kurt's senior year. Kurt and Rachel decide they want to apply to a top school for the dramatic arts in New York City, NYADA, but are intimidated when they <b>meet</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their competition and decide their applications need to include more accomplishments: Rachel proposes that McKinley do West Side Story as the school musical so she can star in it, and Kurt runs for class president. Brittany volunteers to be his campaign manager, and he accepts, but when he objects to her suggestions for posters and paraphernalia as overemphasizing his sexuality, she decides {{to run for the}} office herself. Kurt tries out for the musical, but the directors aren't convinced that he's masculine enough to portray Tony, the romantic male lead, and cast Blaine instead, even though he's only a junior; Kurt is given the minor role of Officer Krupke. When Rachel believes that she might not be cast as Maria, the female lead, she panics and decides to run for class president as well, infuriating Kurt. She eventually withdraws and throws her support behind Kurt, and secretly decides to help him further by stuffing the ballot box in his favor. He nevertheless loses to Brittany, and Rachel is suspended from school for cheating. The same day that Kurt loses, his father wins a special congressional election against Sue.|$|E

After {{the fall of communism}} in Romania, the Romanian Bahá'í community organized itself in order to form its first National Spiritual Assembly in 1991. In 2005 the Romanian Bahá'í community numbered some 7,000, but in January 2007 a law was passed that imposed restrictive requirements on religious communities that wished to be recognized by the government, which Bahá'ís and adherents of other minority religions could not <b>meet.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> the restrictions include waiting as long as twelve years after petitioning before a religious community can start to apply for recognition and the requirement that a legally-recognized religion must have over 22,000 members.|$|E
25|$|Robert Neighbors {{recorded}} one of {{the best}} known meetings with Old Owl. While he was a Texas Indian Agent for the Republic in 1845, Major Neighbors was at a Tonkawa camp. Old Owl arrived with 40 warriors, and in a manner the Major called “most insolent,” demanded that the Tonkawa feed the war party and their horses, and provide for them entertainment. The Tonkawas, in fear of their lives, provided 40 women, food and shelter, and cared for the horses at once. Neighbors, who had just been appointed Indian Agent for all Texas Indians including the Comanche, took this opportunity to <b>meet</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his new charges, and told them he was hopeful of civilizing them. Old Owl, introduced to Neighbors, complimented him on his fine blue coat. Neighbors, understanding the meaning of this compliment, presented the Chief with the coat immediately. Other warriors admired his pants, boots, and other clothing, and soon Neighbors was standing only in a nightshirt.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the cuts}} to coal {{production}} and falling percentage of coal {{in the energy}} mix, electricity consumption {{is expected to grow}} by 3.6-4 percent over 2016 to 2020 according to the Thirteenth Plan (2016–2020). According to the same five-year plan, coal power capacity will be expanded from 960 GW to under 1,100 GW by the end of 2020 to <b>meet</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the continued growth in electricity demand. Indeed, in the first two months of 2016, China had added 22 GW of capacity, 14 GW of which was coal, according to the China Electricity Council. To curtail the continued rapid construction of coal fired power plants, strong action was taken in April of the same year by the National Energy Administration (NEA), which issued a directive curbing construction {{in many parts of the}} country. This was followed up in January 2017 when the NEA canceled a further 103 coal power plants, eliminating 120 gigawatts of future coal-fired capacity, despite the resistance of local authorities mindful of the need to create jobs. The decreasing rate of construction is due to the realization that too many power plants had been built and some existing plants were being used far below capacity.|$|E
25|$|Natives on Private Estates Ordinance, 1928 was {{a colonial}} {{ordinance}} {{passed by the}} Legislative council of the Nyasaland protectorate, now Malawi, (a body mainly of senior colonial officials, with a minority of nominated members representing European residents) to regulate {{the conditions under which}} African tenants who farmed land on estates owned by European settlers within that protectorate. The legislation corrected some of the worst abuses of the system of thangata, under which tenants were required to work in lieu of paying rent. However, it failed in its intention of encouraging these tenants to increase production on the undeveloped land in those estates because of the world-wide economic downturn in the Great Depression of the 1930s. Tensions between estate owners and tenants continued in the 1940s and early 1950s over evictions and the tenants’ desire to market their produce freely. The legislation was modified in 1952 to <b>meet</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these problems, but only the colonial government's purchase of estate lands to resettle former tenants after 1952 and final abolition of thangata by the Africans on Private Estates Ordinance, 1962, passed shortly before independence, created an African peasantry with free access to farming land.|$|E
25|$|As {{the demand}} for direct labour on tobacco estates {{declined}} with collapse {{in the market for}} flue-cured tobacco, the estate owners claimed that they had insufficient work for their labour tenants to meet their obligations under the thangata system and that they had become rent-free squatters who should be liable to be evicted. The owners also complained of the significant numbers resident on their estate who paid no rent under non-disturbance clauses. To <b>meet</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the estate owners’ demands but also give some protection to tenants the protectorate government introduced the Natives on Private Estates Ordinance 1928, which abolishing all rights under non-disturbance clauses, but gave tenants tenancies with a five-year term and with maximum rents fixed by District Rent Boards. Rents could be satisfied in cash, by labour or by selling economic crops to the owner. Blantyre and East Africa Ltd accepted tobacco in lieu of cash rents on some estates but others had become crowded and during the 1930s it obtained cash rents from subsistence farmers on these instead. The company ceased direct operations on its estates in Zomba and Chiradzulu districts, and in 1929 there were no Europeans resident on its estates in those districts, only an agent living in Zomba who visited them periodically.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before this}} time, Rameau {{had made the}} {{acquaintance}} of the powerful financier Alexandre Le Riche de La Poupelinière, who became his patron until 1753. La Pouplinière's mistress (and later, wife), Thérèse des Hayes, was Rameau's pupil and a great admirer of his music. In 1731, Rameau became the conductor of La Pouplinière's private orchestra, which was of an extremely high quality. He held the post for 22 years; he was succeeded by Johann Stamitz and then Gossec. La Pouplinière's salon enabled Rameau to <b>meet</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the leading cultural figures of the day, including Voltaire, who soon began collaborating with the composer. Their first project, the tragédie en musique Samson, was abandoned because an opera on a religious theme by Voltaire—a notorious critic of the Church—was likely to be banned by the authorities. Meanwhile, Rameau had introduced his new musical style into the lighter genre of the opéra-ballet with the highly successful Les Indes galantes. It was followed by two tragédies en musique, Castor et Pollux (1737) and Dardanus (1739), and another opéra-ballet, Les fêtes d'Hébé (also 1739). All these operas of the 1730s are among Rameau's most highly regarded works. However, the composer followed them with six years of silence, in which the only work he produced was {{a new version of}} Dardanus (1744). The reason for this interval in the composer's creative life is unknown, although it is possible he had a falling-out with the authorities at the Académie royale de la musique.|$|E

2500|$|The DOI system offers persistent, semantically-interoperable {{resolution}} to related current data and is {{best suited to}} material {{that will be used}} in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as [...] "identifiers" [...] doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other [...] "identifier systems" [...] may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL), URLs, Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes.

2500|$|On December 14, 1946, 26 {{year old}} Anne Louise Certain {{attended}} the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville.

[...] Scruggs and Certain began dating and fell in love. They were married {{about a year and a}} half later in April 1948. When Flatt and Scruggs formed the new group, Scruggs had done most of the bookings for the band, but being on the road for hours in a car and stopping at a phone booth to communicate with venues, often at odd hours, was difficult. Louise had a business aptitude and began helping by doing the phone work. She eventually became the [...] booking agent and ultimately the group's manager, Nashville's first female to become prominent in that role. Her acumen and skills in the job were prescient. She turned the band into TV personalities, and helped propel them into what today would be called rock stars, touring with Joan Baez and performing at the prestigious Newport Folk Festival. [...] She recruited noted artist Thomas B. Allen, who had done covers for The New Yorker and Sports Illustrated to create cover illustrations for 17 of the group's albums. She helped market the group to younger audiences at college campuses and arranged a live album to be recorded at Carnegie Hall. Earl Scruggs said, [...] "What talent I had never would have peaked without her. She helped shape music up as a business, instead of just people out picking and grinning". [...] Louise died on February 2, 2006 at age 78, predeceasing her husband by six years.
