25|$|In {{addition}} to the requirement that the species be considered kosher, <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> (but not fish) must come from a healthy animal slaughtered in {{a process known as}} shechitah. Without the proper slaughtering practices even an otherwise kosher animal will be rendered treif. The slaughtering process is intended to be quick and relatively painless to the animal. Forbidden parts of animals include the blood, some fats, and the area in and around the sciatic nerve.|$|E
25|$|According to kashrut, <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> {{may not be}} {{combined}} with dairy products, nor may they touch plates or utensils that have been touched by dairy products. Therefore, Jews who strictly observe kashrut divide their kitchens into different sections for meat and for dairy, with separate ovens, plates, and utensils (or as much as is reasonable, given financial and space constraints; there are procedures to kasher utensils that have touched dairy to allow their use for meat).|$|E
25|$|Although Joseph {{fought a}} losing battle in the kosher <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> industry, he managed to achieve some notable accomplishments, {{including}} the hiring of qualified shochtim, introducing irremovable seals ("plumba") to identify kosher birds, and setting up Mashgichim to oversee slaughter houses. He also took {{an active role in}} establishing the Etz Chaim Yeshiva—the first yeshiva on the Lower East Side, which was founded in 1886.

Nonetheless, these beverages were formerly drunk as a compliment to <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> dishes, sweet porridge, and dessert.

25|$|There are {{typically}} {{two types of}} vegetables in okroshka. The first must have a neutral taste, such as boiled potatoes, turnips, rutabagas, carrots, or fresh cucumbers. The second must be spicy, consisting of mainly green onion {{as well as other}} herbs—greens of dill, parsley, chervil, celery, or tarragon. Different <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry</b> can be used in the same soup. The most common ingredient is beef alone or with poultry. If it is made with fish, the best choice would be tench, European perch, pike-perch, cod, or other neutral-tasting fish.|$|E

IgG was purified by affinity chromatography against protein A, a normal cell wall component of Staphylococcus aureus. Affinity chromatography yielded high-purity IgG in a one-step purification procedure.

25|$|The most {{important}} commercial {{sector of the}} state is that of retail foodstuffs, especially those selling groceries, <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry.</b> This represented over 40% of the commercial sector in 1998. Just over 30% of commerce was dedicated to non-food products such as clothing and pharmaceuticals with the rest mostly dedicated to wholesale foods. From the latter 20th century, tourism has taken up much of the economic slack left behind by the demise of much of the state’s mining industry, with income from this sector surpassing that of the petroleum industry. The state has a variety of historic, cultural and natural attractions. Commerce and tourism employ about 44% of the population.|$|E
25|$|On February 17, 1927, the Board of Estimate {{adopted the}} final {{plans for the}} highway, setting a hearing date of March 24. It was split into two sections, Section one went from Canal Street to 59th Street. Section two was to carry the road over the NYCRR's 60th Street Yard from 59th Street to 72nd Street. Section two was {{approved}} by the Board of Estimate on August 16, 1928; section one was postponed until September 27 due to objections. On October 18, the Board of Estimate approved section one. The highway was advocated by most business interests, including the Downtown League, the Fifth Avenue Association, the West End Association, and eleven other organizations. They cited increasing traffic and the need of a bypass route to support the highway, which would cost little in comparison to its benefits. Miller spoke {{at a meeting of the}} Market and Business Men's Association of the Greenwich and Chelsea Districts on October 30, 1928, detailing plans for the highway.

500|$|There {{were two}} groups of guilds – first, those that {{supplied}} the raw materials; butchers, fishmongers, grain merchants, and gardeners. The second group were those that supplied prepared foods; bakers, pastry cooks, sauce makers, poulterers, and caterers. There were also guilds that offered both raw materials and prepared food, such as the charcutiers and rôtisseurs (purveyors of roasted meat dishes). They would supply cooked meat pies and dishes as well as raw <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry.</b> This caused issues with butchers and poulterers, who sold the same raw materials. [...] The guilds served as a training ground for those within the industry. The degrees of assistant-cook, full-fledged cook and master chef were conferred. Those who reached the level of master chef were of considerable rank in their individual industry, and enjoyed {{a high level of}} income as well as economic and job security. At times, those in the royal kitchens did fall under the guild hierarchy, but it was necessary to find them a parallel appointment based on their skills after leaving the service of the royal kitchens. This was not uncommon as the Paris cooks' guild regulations allowed for this movement.|$|E

Internationally the company sells turnovers, tortas, Cini-Minis, muffins, brownies, and vanilla soft-serve ice cream in cones and sundaes. In most markets where BK sells ice cream, it also sells a mix-in dessert under various names. Some of these international dessert products differ from the domestic products in terms of preparation; an example is the pies sold in Asian countries that are fried, turnover-style, instead of the deep-dish tart style associated with American sweet-filled pies.|$|E
