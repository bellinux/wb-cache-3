[...] In 1974, {{he became the first}} black ever named to the House Committee on Ways and Means, a position he assumed in 1975 (and left the Judiciary Committee), and by 1979 had become the chairman of its important Subcommittee on Health. [...] In 1976, he was named to the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. [...] By 1979, Rangel {{was a member of the}} influential House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. [...] Rangel combined his solidly liberal views–interest group ratings in 1978 indicated he was the most liberal member of the New York State congressional delegation–with a pragmatic approach towards finding political and legislative compromises. [...] Rangel built alliances with others in Congress (collaborating for example with Michigan Republican Guy Vander Jagt on welfare reform measures), with people in governmental agencies, and with the Carter administration. [...] In some cases Rangel was criticized for being too pragmatic, such as when he switched his position on natural gas deregulation; Rangel denied that he did so in exchange for the authorization of a new federal building in Harlem. [...] Rangel said of himself, [...] "I guess I'm practical, but you have to live with yourself and <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not so practical that you sell out a part of yourself." ...|$|E

50|$|Stiffness is {{much less}} complex {{than the other two}} topics. This is {{directly}} and solely tied to your swing speed. The faster the swing, the stiffer the shaft. This is because the faster you swing, the more the club will bend; if the club bends too much, it will whip through impact and the face will be square for a very short time. Stiffer shafts don't flex as much and keep the face squarer through contact. The other side is less stiff shafts will produce a higher ball speed off the face. So the goal is to get the most flexible shaft that fits your swing, but stiff enough so it doesn't hurt your control. This is why it is important that you <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> swinging the right shafts for you. Possible options are junior, women, senior, regular, stiff, and xstiff.|$|E
