50|$|The Clause 7 {{states that}} the central or state {{government}} may require a person to possess an Aadhaar number if he/she is receiving some subsidy. If they do not possess an Aadhaar number, they {{will be required to}} apply for other, in meantime the government will provide them the subsidy using an alternate <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification.</b> According to Clause 8, UIDAI may perform verification of Aadhaar for other private and public agencies on request in exchange for a fee. The requesting must obtain the consent of the Aadhaar holder for verification, and inform him/her of nature of the information that will be shared upon verification. The Clause 8 (4) states that UIDAI may share identity information, but it cannot share the biometric information. The Clause 9 states that Aadhaar is not a proof of citizenship or domicile.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} extract {{pathological}} features of heart sound signal accurately, an algorithm for extracting the sub-band energy is developed {{based on the}} wavelet packet. The db 6 wavelet is taken as the mother function, and the best wavelet packet basis of heart sound signal is picked out. Then, various heart sound signals are decomposed into four levels and the wavelet packet coefficients of the best basis are obtained. According to the equal-value relation between wavelet packet coefficients and signal energy in time domain, the normalized sub-band energy of the best basis is extracted as the feature vector. Based on BP network, seven identification models for seven kinds of heart sound were trained separately. Then, these models were tested by using 70 heart sounds, and the <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> accuracy is 72. 9 %...|$|E
40|$|Compressible Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of {{turbulent}} reacting flows potentially {{offers a}} realistic {{representation of the}} physical phenomena involved in thermoacoustic instabilities. Coupled with Helmholtz solvers, which provide a <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> of the acoustic eigenmodes in complex geometries, that advanced numerical tool may provide a very powerful environment to assess the stability of real engine combustion chambers. The common use of a fully unstructured LES solver and a Helmholtz eigenmode tool proves here to be very useful to diagnose two operating points of a real gas turbine chamber which are known to operate with self-sustained oscillations. If the geometrical complexity and proper computational domain are chosen, the two thermo-acoustic instabilities are very well reproduced. Predictibility of LES for such problems is thus demonstrated provided that issues pertaining to the inlet acoustic impedances can be properly answered...|$|E

40|$|DNA barcoding is a {{new term}} {{introduced}} in to scientific literatures by Hebert and coworkers almost a decade ago (1). The concept of barcoding alone is well-known to the public: a series of black bars printed on many commercial products (1 - 3) (Universal Product Code), which are used to distinguish different products. Advances made in molecular biology and molecular techniques late 20 th century e. g. sequencing technologies, has inspired scientists to apply barcoding concept to all domains of life by using the unique nature of DNA for each single species, in order to generate a comprehensive library of living organisms on the planet earth (2, 6). Such an ambitious initiative {{would result in a}} global DNA barcode database which will be valuable for biological scientists, medical, governmental and legal agencies as a <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> (1). The first initiative for DNA barcoding was funded in Canada and later on several DNA barcoding campaigns came in to the scene. The International Barcode of Life consortiu...|$|E
40|$|In most nationstates the {{construction}} and making of a national identity is a historic phenomenon as the process started hundreds of years ago. In Namibia however, {{the construction}} of a nation and a national identity has just been instigated. Namibia, as one of the last colonies in Africa, did not gain independence until 1990. For a long time, Namibia was subjected to German as well as South African colonial and apartheid rule. Our aim with this essay was to examine the Namibian construction of a national identity, with reference to Namibia's historical postcolonial and postapartheid background. The focus is on how people from two ethnic backgrounds, the Owambo and the San, experience their situation as Namibians in one of the youngest countries in Africa. Hence, we have made 22 interviews in northern Namibia during the fall of 2004. The purpose with this essay has been to comprehend and present a process of nation-building and national identity in the making. We have found that 'ethnicity' still is an important <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> in Namibia. Moreover, the fact that Namibia is a postcolonial and postapartheid state, strongly affects the Namibian nation-building and {{the construction of a}} Namibian identity. Ethnic categories are still ingrained in people; the distinctions signify difference, and are used as means of identification. Alhough simultaneously, the segregation forced by the colonisers has now made ethnic categories less distinct since such divisions relate to apartheid and repression. The Owambo group tend to be more aware of their position as Namibians in the Namibian nation than the San groups, and their culture is to a large extent 'dominant' and influences the nation-building. The Owambos identify themselves as Namibians. The San groups on the other hand, identify themselves with their ethnic or tribal group. They are also in an inferior minority position, which they are highly aware of...|$|E
