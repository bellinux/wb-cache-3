40|$|The control <b>rod</b> <b>assembly</b> {{controls}} reactor {{power by}} adjusting its position during normal operation and shuts down chain reactions by its free drop under scram conditions. Therefore, the drop {{performance of the}} control <b>rod</b> <b>assembly</b> {{is important for the}} safety of a nuclear reactor. In this study, the drop performance of the conceptually designed control <b>rod</b> <b>assembly</b> for the prototype generation IV sodium-cooled fast reactor that is being developed at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute as a next-generation nuclear reactor was experimentally investigated. For the performance test, the test facility and test procedure were established first, and several free drop performance tests of the control <b>rod</b> <b>assembly</b> under different flow rate conditions were then carried out. Moreover, performance tests under several types and magnitudes of seismic loading conditions were also conducted to investigate the effects of seismic loading on the drop performance of the control <b>rod</b> <b>assembly.</b> The drop time of the conceptually designed control <b>rod</b> <b>assembly</b> for 0 % of the tentatively designed flow rate was measured to be 1. 527 seconds, and this agrees well with the analytically calculated drop time. It was also observed that the effect of seismic loading on the drop time was not significant...|$|R

Subsequent rod drop tests showed the <b>rod</b> <b>assembly</b> stuck at or above the same not-fully-inserted position, leading to removal and examination of the <b>rod</b> <b>assembly.</b> The examination showed several rods were cracked, which were later determined to result from volumetric growth of the hafnium neutron absorber and differential thermal expansion (hafnium compared to the stainless steel rod cladding). Taipower later replaced all hafnium-containing rods with a different alloy to resolve the issue.|$|R

The prompt γ current of self-powered detector is ignored normally due to its weakness compared with the delayed β current, although it promptly reflects the flux change of the core.

40|$|SummaryActin and its key {{regulatory}} component, cofilin, {{are found}} together in large rod-shaped assemblies in neurons subjected to energy stress. Such inclusions are also enriched in Alzheimer's disease brain, and appear in transgenic models of neurodegeneration. Neuronal insults, such as energy loss and/or oxidative stress, result in rapid dephosphorylation of the cellular cofilin pool {{prior to its}} assembly into rod-shaped inclusions. Although these events implicate a role for phosphatases in cofilin rod formation, a mechanism linking energy stress, phosphocofilin turnover, and subsequent <b>rod</b> <b>assembly</b> has been elusive. We demonstrate the ATP-sensitive interaction of the cofilin phosphatase chronophin (CIN) with the chaperone hsp 90 to form a biosensor that mediates cofilin/actin rod formation. Our results suggest a model whereby attenuated interactions between CIN and hsp 90 during ATP depletion enhance CIN-dependent cofilin dephosphorylation and consequent <b>rod</b> <b>assembly,</b> thereby providing a mechanism {{for the formation of}} pathological actin/cofilin aggregates during neurodegenerative energy flux...|$|R
