Traditional celebrations involved the wearing of oak leaves but these have now died out. Charles II is commemorated by statues in London's Soho Square, in Edinburgh's Parliament Square, in St Mary's Square in Gloucester, and near the south portal of Lichfield Cathedral, and is depicted extensively in literature and other media.

50|$|In {{historical}} contexts (sixteenth to <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>centuries),</b> petticoat {{refers to}} any separate skirt worn with a gown, bedgown, bodice or jacket; these petticoats are not, strictly speaking, underwear {{as they were}} made to be seen. In both historical and modern contexts, petticoat refers to skirt-like undergarments worn for warmth or to give the skirt or dress the desired fashionable shape. In this context a petticoat may be called a waist slip or underskirt (UK) or half slip (US), with petticoat restricted to extremely full garments. Petticoat can also refer to a full-length slip in the UK, although this usage is somewhat old-fashioned.|$|R

He served under John, Duke of Bedford, the uncle of the eight-year-old King Henry VI. FitzAlan was involved in recovering fortresses in the Île-de-France region, and in suppressing local rebellions. His military career ended, however, at the Battle of Gerbevoy in 1435. Refusing to retreat in the face of superior forces, Arundel was shot in the foot and captured. His leg was later amputated, and he died shortly afterwards from the injury.

5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches.

Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time as}} the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption in the <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E

40|$|British {{literature}} from the mid-eighteenth to <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>centuries</b> {{has long been}} important to critical investigations centered on ecology and environmentalism. Ecocritical explorations of this literature, however, often look through texts to the plants, animals, and environments they represent, bypassing important questions about the act of representation itself. Resisting the temptation to take literary representations of the environment at face value, this dissertation moves the focus away from what written representations of the environment say about it to how those representations are made. Through a combination of close reading and examination of works {{in light of the}} literary critical and scientific ideals of their moment, I investigate the epistemological beliefs held by individuals and communities of authors about how knowledge is absorbed by the mind, what standards of documentation are necessary for its transmission in a written text, and which proofs of authenticity are required for it to be accepted as legitimate. Grounds of Knowledge discusses both literary and practical texts from the mid- 1740 s to the mid- 1830 s, including the works of William Collins, Joseph Warton, Thomas Warton, Charlotte Smith, John Clare, Jane Austen, and the agriculturalists Arthur Young, William Marshall, and William Cobbett. As these authors portray the environment in both literary and practical works, I argue, they use representational methods that are based on epistemological ideals as well as aesthetic and practical considerations. In each case, their works are governed by “unofficial” epistemologies—philosophies of collecting, apprehending, and disseminating knowledge that are implicit in written works and exist independent of academic and professional philosophy. By focusing on the epistemology of representation, this dissertation fills a gap left open by traditional thematic ecocriticism as well as more recent ontologically-based forms of ecocriticism. It does not seek to undermine the ecocritical project but rather to provide a much-needed foundation for ecocritical investigation in understanding how and why British authors of the mid-eighteenth to <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>centuries</b> represented the environment in their works...|$|R
5|$|The museum's {{earliest}} collections {{began to}} coalesce in 1836 {{through the work}} of Lewis C.

Many of the exhibits feature items that are unique to New Jersey, including Native American artifacts, minerals, and fossils. These exhibits include a set of fossilized dinosaur tracks believed to belong to the carnivorous Grallator, from the Jurassic-period discovered near Towaco in Morris County, and the skeleton of a 10,000-year old mastodon (Mammut americanum) discovered in Salem County in 1869. The mastodon, found in a marl pit near Mannington, was sold by a local farmer to a travelling circus before it was acquired by Rutgers for display.|$|E
5|$|Cley {{and nearby}} Blakeney had been prosperous and {{important}} ports in the Middle Ages, but land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the wharf. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost to Blakeney and other Norfolk ports. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. In the <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the Lord of the Manor constructed the present road to the beach in exchange for closing the ancient right of way across the marshes.|$|E
5|$|In poor {{condition}} in the <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the nave walls were leaning outward and the roofs decayed, so restoration was proposed in 1848 under R.K.

Butterfield however resigned in 1867 and the restoration was finally carried out 1867–84 by John Pollard Seddon. The church was substantially restored in stages {{at a cost of}} £8,500, and the roof was renewed, apart from the wagon roof over the chancel, which survives above Seddon's roof. The restoration work in general consisted of the reconstruction of the nave, the lifting and paving of the chancel, {{the construction of a new}} altar and the reconstruction of the north and south transepts. The nave was opened in 1869 and the tower and south transepts were opened in 1880.|$|E
40|$|Between the mid-eighteenth and the <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>centuries,</b> the Crown coordinated a {{revolution}} in land usage in the Kawartha Lakes, as elsewhere in the colony, through 'civilization' and land redistribution. Attempts to change native society and build settler communities did not quite unfold {{the way the government}} intended. 'Civilization' helped the Mississauga farm and taught skills that eased interaction with colonial society, but they continued to produce much of their food by traditional means. Speculation isolated settlers and made land acquisition more difficult, though some speculators provided essential services. Most immigrants bought land privately and many were not able to establish themselves as farmers. Preferential grants were particularly poor at distributing land to settlers and Crown or Clergy Reserves sales {{were much more likely to}} transfer property directly to users. The transition to agricultural land usage occurred largely through the state's mediation of conflicting claims to access...|$|R
40|$|Women's {{education}} {{during the}} colonial and federal periods of American history gave rise to sampler-making, which, {{in the most recent}} decades, has become a credible art form. This examination of education's impact on the art of sampler-making is divided into nine chapters that can be grouped into three sections. The first section, comprised of the first two chapters, gives basic information on the use of ornamental arts in the education of women and on the various aspects of making a sampler. Section two, which includes the remaining chapters, takes an in-depth look at the schools, teachers, and sampler designs that came from new England during the late seventeenth through <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>centuries.</b> The final part of this thesis is the conclusion, which looks at how sampler-making was transformed into an art form and valuable collector's item when, before, samplers had been used primarily as an educational tool for women.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between architecture and defense during the mid-eighteenth to <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>centuries</b> in {{the portion of}} Hispanic Sonora that later became southern Arizona is examined. Included are a description and analysis of presidio fortifications, and a comparison of these defense works with other kinds of fortified and garrisoned places found in the region. Separate sections offer appraisals of how raw materials, labor, and tools, were used to plan and build frontier strongholds in northern New Spain and early Mexico. Also provided is {{a description of the}} weapons and tactics used in the defense of fortified places. An evaluation is made of the role of fortifications in grand strategy. Based on this evidence, it is argued that defense involved a wider variety of institutions than has traditionally been recognized. The survey of defensive sites also indicates that the presidios do not share certain important features. These differences reflect gradual changes in design concepts over time. It is argued that the causes of these modifications are principally the results of shifts in strategy...|$|R
5|$|Renaissance is {{a concept}} {{formulated}} by cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt in the <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> to describe the intellectual and artistic movement that began in Italy in the fourteenth century and saw an attempt to revive {{the principles of the}} Greek and Roman classical worlds. It encompassed a rational and sceptical attitude, a return to ideas of original sources and proportion and balance in art. The major ideas of the Renaissance are generally considered to have reached Northern Europe much later, in the late fifteenth century. Scotland has been seen as part of a wider Northern Renaissance that is generally considered to have stretched into the early seventeenth century, when it was replaced by the grander styles of the Baroque. However, the association of Baroque styles with Catholicism in predominantly Protestant Scotland tended to result in this trend being overlooked and the period from about 1620 {{to the end of the}} seventeenth century is sometimes characterised as a late Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|Trade in {{the region}} was {{negatively}} impacted {{by the development of}} an oceanic route from Europe around Africa to India, and in the tax registers of the late sixteenth century, Alanya failed to qualify as an urban center. In 1571 the Ottomans designated the city as part of the newly conquered province of Cyprus. The conquest further diminished the economic importance of Alanya's port. Traveler Evliya Çelebi visited the city in 1671/1672, and wrote on the preservation of Alanya Castle, but also on the dilapidation of Alanya's suburbs. The city was reassigned in 1864 under Konya, and in 1868 under Antalya, as it is today.

5|$|Henry Raeburn, {{most famous}} for his {{intimate}} portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. His pupils included the brothers William, Archibald and Andrew Robertson. The next generation of portrait painters included David Watson and John Watson Gordon. Significant Glasgow artists included John Graham-Gilbert and Daniel Macnee. David Wilkie emerged as {{of one of the}} most influential British artists of the century in a variety of forms. Alexander Nasmyth helped formulate the tradition of Scottish landscape painting, which focused in the <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> on the Highlands. It was taken into the late nineteenth century by artists including Horatio McCulloch, Joseph Farquharson and William McTaggart. Towards the end of the century a number of artist colonies were founded, particularly in coastal communities such as Pittenweem and Kirkudbright. Wilkie was instrumental in the development of genre painting, which was pursued by artists including John Burnet, Alexander George Fraser and Walter Geikie. He also helped inspire the interest in Spanish and oriental painting, continued by William Allan, David Roberts and John Phillip.|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{changing}} administrative context of drainage in south-west Lancashire from the mid-seventeenth to the <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>centuries.</b> Successive schemes managed by Commissions of Sewers, piecemeal reclamation and private agreement were characterised by primitive technology, under-investment and poor management. Consequently, their achievements were limited. Large scale drainage schemes {{under the control}} of single individuals or powerful syndicates enjoyed greater success, but to coordinate drainage across an ecosystem that went beyond estate boundaries required state intervention {{in the form of an}} Act of Parliament of 1779. After some initial success the drainage commissioners found themselves immersed in legal wranglings with landowners and maintenance of the drainage system largely fell into abeyance. It was not until the landlords provided the administrative and financial resources to invest in technological solutions in the 1840 s that the land achieved its full potential. It is argued that drainage of this land, resulting in its transformation from some of the worst land in the country to some of the best, was a major contributor not only to the agricultural success of the region, but also to Lancashire's industrial success...|$|R
