5|$|The new Dunston B Power Station was {{designed}} by consulting engineers Merz & McLellan. Its design {{was different from the}} design of other power stations at the time because it enclosed the machinery in a steel frame clad with glass. This was a departure from the usual power station designs, which normally enclosed the machinery in a concrete or brick wall. Dunston B is thought to be the first power station in the UK and possibly even the world to be built in this way. The station was also the first in the world to use <b>metal</b> <b>clad</b> <b>switchgear</b> at a voltage as high as 66,000V.|$|E

40|$|Insulating spacers are {{commonly}} used in the bus bars of <b>metal</b> <b>clad</b> <b>switchgears</b> and transformers, {{as well as in}} circuit breaker/cable compartments, to enhance the dielectric integrity of inter-phase and phase to ground insulation. This experimental investigation presents the role of dust pollution on discharges due to power frequency stresses on rod electrodes in the presence of parallel insulating spacers. Gap length and spacer distances from the interelectrode axis were varied to investigate the influence of dust film on breakdown voltage and pulsative corona characteristics. The results show that the presence of the spacer tends to considerably influence the effects of dust pollution on the discharge characteristics. The paper discusses the controlling mechanisms of these variations as well as the impact of the observed results on the performance of air gap clearances of the power apparatus.

40|$|To {{fabricate}} <b>metal</b> <b>clad</b> {{optical fibres}} for corrosion sensing, we investigated and compared three techniques of preparing <b>metal</b> <b>cladding</b> {{on the surface}} of fibres with cladding removed. The first technique directly deposits iron on the fibre surface by physical vacuum deposition (PVD). The second technique uses nickel on the fibre under the control of a magnetic field in a vacuum environment (MFV). The third technique prepares silver on the fibre by chemical sputtering plating (CP). Finally corrosion-sensitive fibre samples with <b>metal</b> <b>cladding</b> treated as in the above three techniques are electroplated with the materials for monitoring. The <b>metal</b> <b>cladding</b> by the first technique achieved the best quality, and also the desirable material composition and structure as examined by x-ray diffraction analysis. The corrosion parameters of the first <b>metal</b> <b>clad</b> samples, including the change of open circuit potential E-corr and linear polarized resistance R-p with Cl- concentrations, were measured.

50|$|The {{new power}} station {{employed}} five 11,000 kWkW turbo-alternators. The station was now equipped to supply power to over 60 sq mi; from Shilbottle in Northumberland, {{right down to}} Malton in North Yorkshire. Carville B long held the record as the most economical power station in the world. The station took this record in 1914 when some of its units were completed, taking the record from Fisk Generating Station in Chicago, Illinois. Carville had an economy of only 10.05 lb of steam consumed per kilowatt hour generated when all five units were operating at full load. The pressure of the steam used in the station was at 275 psi, and at a temperature of 700 degrees Fahrenheit; this was the highest steam pressure adopted by any electric supply company in England. The station used <b>metal</b> <b>clad</b> <b>switchgear.</b>|$|E
40|$|Load break {{switches}} (LBSs) {{are common}} inside <b>metal</b> <b>clad</b> <b>switchgear</b> assemblies where space is a limiting factor. SF 6 is usually {{used in this}} application due to its superior electrical characteristics, but is unfortunately also a strong greenhouse gas. Therefore development of new products, utilizing air which is an environmental friendly alternative, is in progress. Since air has much lower dielectric strength than SF 6, the main challenge with this is therefore to reduce the size. Compact SF 6 products have created a retrofit market, and in many existing installation sites larger products will not fit. Current interruption is a complex process and depends on several parameters, {{and it is not}} straight forward to optimize the design of a medium voltage (MV) switch. Numerical simulation which is a common for product development in other areas is difficult for this application. Due to the long dominance of SF 6 products, little research has been published about the design criteria for LBS technology in air. The scope of the thesis covers current interruption of MV LBSs in air with respect to various design parameters, such as nozzle geometry, nozzle materials, gas flow, and contact movement. Both gas blow-assisted current interruption (associated with puffer breakers) and ablation-assisted current interruption are addressed. The material in the nozzle can enhance the interruption capability. Such a nozzle material is called ablation material. When the arc is burning close to the surface of an ablation material, gas is evaporated which cools the arc. This technology is used to some extent for low voltage switchgear, but much less for higher voltages. The objective is therefore to investigate the potential of this technology for the MV LBS application. All work is done experimentally with similar test conditions as are used for product type testing. A direct powered MV laboratory and a test switch are built. The test switch is designed particularly for parameter studies. The result from air blow experiments reveal the minimum upstream pressure drop required for current interruption for various basic nozzle geometries, and at different contact positions. One study is particular relevant for the 24 kV / 630 A class, and it is found that 0. 25 - 0. 3 bar upstream pressure drop appears to be a threshold value for successful interruption. It is also presented how the minimum upstream pressure drop varies for different MV LBS ratings. The results show that the needed pressure drop is approximately proportional, both towards the current and towards the rate of rise of recovery voltage. This investigation is made so that the majority of all MV LBS ratings (7 - 52 kV and up to 900 A) are covered. From the ablation experiments it was found that high content of hydrogen in the ablation material is favorable for enhancing the current interruption capability. In a comparison experiment between different polymers, polypropylene shows best interruption capability. This material was therefor applied as ablation material in the test switch, and tested in the MV laboratory. The results reveal high capability to interrupt the thermal phase (over the needs for most MV LBSs), but also that the transient recovery voltage several milliseconds after current zero often leads to dielectric re-ignition. This is opposite to a puffer breaker where the thermal interruption instead appears to be the crucial part. PhD i elkraftteknikkPhD in Electric Power Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{metal-clad}} disk cavities {{designed for}} nanolasers in the visible red spectrum with subwavelength device size and mode volume. <b>Metal</b> <b>cladding</b> suppresses radiation loss and supports low order modes with room temperature Q of 200 to 300.

Threshold gain calculations show that room temperature lasing is possible using multiple GaInP/AlGaInP quantum wells as the gain medium. Placing a planar metal reflector under the cavity can enhance radiation and extraction efficiencies or increase the Q, without incurring additional metallic absorption loss. We show that the far-field radiation characteristics are strongly affected by the devices’ immediate surroundings, such as changes in <b>metal</b> <b>cladding</b> thickness, even as the resonant mode profile, frequency, and Q remain the same.
