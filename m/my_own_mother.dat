500|$|Aubrey and Sherry Lansing, {{who entered}} the movie {{business}} as a script reader at MGM under Aubrey, were struck by a car while crossing Wilshire Boulevard in the mid-1970s. Both were badly hurt and Lansing had to use crutches {{for a year and}} a half. Aubrey nursed her back to health. [...] "He came every day. He would say, 'You're not going to limp.' <b>My</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother</b> and father couldn't give me more support," [...] she told Variety in 2004.|$|E
6000|$|GERALD [He {{is quite}} beside himself with rage and indignation.] Lord Illingworth, you have insulted the purest thing on God's earth, {{a thing as}} pure as <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother.</b> You have insulted the woman I love most {{in the world with}} <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother.</b> As there is a God in Heaven, I will kill you! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you think}} I {{am going to}} insult <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother</b> and sisters to please any woman's finical prudish notions'? Pray what did Mrs. Poynsett say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By Jove!" [...] I cried; [...] "and that's true enough. <b>My</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother's</b> {{family had}} a banshee; and, now I {{come to think of}} it, it has comforted me in many a cold hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{was long}} after. I {{think it was}} that woman's barbarity that made my father marry again, {{and a very good}} thing that was. It was wretched before. Miss Headworth was in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother's</b> time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You forget; you {{are talking}} of <b>my</b> brother, <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother's</b> son. I will hear no harm of Adrian; his ways are {{different}} to ours, but he is good-hearted at bottom. Do you understand me, Martin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have {{rather more}} sincerity, more dignity, more {{attachment}} to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother,</b> {{than to try}} to gain favour by affecting what I do not feel,' said Emily.|$|E
6000|$|Elizabeth {{looked up}} rather fiercely; but, kissing her little sister, said, gently, 'Yes, Dora, {{it is really}} true, <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother</b> lies in the churchyard. I will shew you where.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well!" [...] cried Miss Daisy Miller with a laugh; [...] "I guess I know <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother.</b> And {{when she}} has got on my shawl, too! She is always wearing my things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My father wishes it,' said Mark. 'He would, as he {{had promised}} to do, make over to me my share of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother's</b> fortune, and that would, I have been reckoning, bring us to just what we had thought of {{starting}} upon this spring at Micklethwayte.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'By all {{the saints}} in heaven!' cried Reuben, 'which ever of ye strikes {{first at the}} other I'll snap this pistol at his head. None of your jokes, Don Decimo, for by the Lord I'll let drive at you if you were <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother's</b> son. Put up your sword, for the trigger falls easy, and my finger is a twitching.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Who has led me a dance by {{dell and}} dingle [...] My human soul to win, [...] Made me a changeling to <b>my</b> <b>own,</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother,</b> [...] A {{stranger}} to my kin.|$|R
6000|$|... ". [...] . Don't you see I {{loved you}} always? They told me horrible things about you. [...] . <b>My</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother!</b> They told me--you have been--you have been unfaithful to me, and I [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never, mother. How could I,--to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother,</b> who {{has ever}} been so good to me? But {{for the last three}} months we have been to each other nearly as though we were strangers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stumped again!" [...] exclaimed the boy; [...] "who'd {{have thought}} I was so ignorant about <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother?</b> If she ever had sich a brother, {{he must have}} bin drownded, for I never heerd tell of 'im." ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{that for}} a second I {{believed}} it true. I could never believe it. Aunt Emma, so gentle, so kindly, so sweet: incapable of hurting any living thing: the tenderest old lady that breathed upon earth: and <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother's</b> sister, whom I loved as I never before loved anyone! Aunt Emma the murderess! The bare idea was preposterous! I couldn't entertain it. My whole nature revolted from it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let the {{old woman}} alone for giving the lasting colour to her web; I'll engage, {{neighbour}} Homespun, provided you furnish the proper fit, there'll not be a better dress'd lad on the island than <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother's</b> son! But, sin' you cannot be a general good-man, you'll have the comfort of knowing there'll be no more fighting without you. Every body agrees the French won't hold out much longer, and then {{we must have a}} peace for want of enemies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{certainly}} settles the question; my miniature {{had no such}} addition; and yet I {{believe that}} sweet and pensive countenance to be the face of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> beloved <b>mother,</b> and of no one else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have no such}} {{reasonable}} request to make, uncle. I have never wanted new ribbons from you or gay toys. Even from <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother</b> I have not wanted them;--not wanted them faster than they seemed to come without any asking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Mountjoy, I'll {{tell you}} everything, just {{as though you}} were <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother.</b> I have loved your daughter;--oh, I don't know how it is! If she'd be my wife for two years, I don't think I'd mind dying afterward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, nor I either. I {{would have}} split on <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother</b> before I could have stood that. I am afraid {{it is all}} up with him," [...] and he motioned towards {{the man at the}} bottom of the cart.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I've a {{claim on}} you, Eppie--the strongest of all claims. It's my duty, Marner, to <b>own</b> Eppie as <b>my</b> child, {{and provide for}} her. She is <b>my</b> <b>own</b> child--her <b>mother</b> was <b>my</b> wife. I've a natural claim on her that must stand before every other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{love them}} as I love <b>my</b> <b>own</b> father and <b>mother,</b> Jamie. I tried to act towards them as though I was indeed their daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother, dear as life, Saadut Ali Kh√¢n, has {{requested}} that I [...] would permit {{his mother to}} go and reside with him. My friend, all [...] the mothers of my brothers, and {{the women of the}} late Nabob, whom I [...] respect as <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mothers,</b> are here, and it is incumbent upon me to [...] support them: accordingly I do it; and it is improper that they [...] should be separated, nor do I approve it. By God's blessing and [...] your kindness, I hope that all the women of the late Nabob may [...] remain here; it is the wish also of my grandmother and my mother [...] that they should." ...|$|R
60|$|I yawned with prodigious sonority, and {{overturned}} a {{chair with}} my foot. Then bracing myself for the ordeal, through which I looked to what scant information I possessed and <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother</b> wit, to bear me successfully, I strode across to admit my visitor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Think thee what {{thou art}} saying, Bertrade?" [...] he cried. [...] "Dost forget that I be a low-born knave, knowing not <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother</b> and {{questioning}} even {{the identity of}} my father? Could a De Montfort face the world with such a man for husband?" ...|$|E
60|$|But my discontents were {{of another}} nature; I looked upon him {{no longer as}} a husband, but as a near relation, the son of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother,</b> and I {{resolved}} somehow or other to be clear of him, but which way I did not know, nor did it seem possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a drop, your honor. Jasper's {{father was}} an old comrade of <b>my</b> <b>own,</b> and his <b>mother</b> came of an honest and loyal family in this very province." ...|$|R
60|$|Of her soon cheering up again, and our {{signing the}} {{register}} all round. Of my {{going into the}} gallery for Peggotty to bring her to sign it; of Peggotty's hugging me in a corner, and telling me she saw <b>my</b> <b>own</b> dear <b>mother</b> married; of its being over, and our going away.|$|R
60|$|No womanly woman rode {{inside a}} hansom or outside a 'bus. I {{remember}} the day <b>my</b> <b>own</b> dear <b>mother</b> climbed outside a 'bus {{for the first time}} in her life. She was excited, and cried a little; but nobody--heaven be praised!--saw us--that is, nobody of importance. And afterwards she confessed the air was pleasant.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have been}} wild and wayward, but you'll forgive [5] me now; [...] You'll kiss me, <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother,</b> and forgive me ere I go; [6] [...] Nay, nay, {{you must not}} weep, [7] nor let your grief be wild, [...] You should not fret for me, mother, you [8] have another child.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's just it. An {{excellent}} {{woman has}} been taken from us, and, had she been <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother,</b> I could not have received greater kindnesses from her. Her end, my dear Wallingford, was admitted by all the clergy {{to be one of}} the most edifying known in the place for years." ...|$|E
60|$|I endeavoured to {{say that}} I knew he was far more capable than I of {{deciding}} {{what we ought to}} do, but was he sure that this was right? Could I not go forward by myself in search of--I grasped his hand again in my distress and whispered it to him--of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mother.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought you'd {{like to see}} it," [...] Frederick was saying. [...] "I {{built that}} {{mausoleum}} myself, most of it with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> hands. <b>Mother</b> wanted it. The estate was dreadfully encumbered. The best bid I {{could get out of}} the contractors was eleven thousand. I did it myself for a little over eight." ...|$|R
50|$|My {{mother was}} always full of pep and vigor. One time at 75 years of age, she {{dressed up in}} my old Navy uniform, danced a jig and played a piece on her French harp just to help the {{neighborhood}} kids put on a backyard show. My comic Grandma, in spirit at least, is <b>my</b> <b>own</b> beloved <b>mother.</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} {{the risk of}} subsequent trouble, I had assumed the disguise of a middle-aged Angliche--red side-whiskers, florid complexion, a ginger-coloured wig plastered rigidly over the ears towards the temples, high stock collar, nankeen pantaloons, a patch over one eye and an eyeglass fixed in the other. <b>My</b> <b>own</b> sainted <b>mother</b> would never have known me.|$|R
