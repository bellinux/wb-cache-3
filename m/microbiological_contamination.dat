40|$|Sterilisation {{processes}} are compulsory in medicine, pharmacy, and food industries to prevent infections of consumers and <b>microbiological</b> <b>contaminations</b> of products. Monitoring the sterilisation by conventional microbiological methods is time- and lab-consuming. To overcome this problem, {{in this work}} a novel biosensor has been proposed. The sensor enables a fast method to evaluate sterilisation processes. By means of thin-film technology the sensor's transducer structures in form of IDEs (interdigitated electrodes) have been fabricated on a silicon substrate. Physical characterisation of the developed sensor was done by AFM, SEM, and profilometry. Impedance analyses were conducted for the electrical characterisation. As microbiological layer spores of B. atrophaeus have been immobilised on the sensing structure; spores of this type are a well-known sterilisation test organism. Impedance measurements at a fixed frequency over time were performed to monitor the immobilisation process. A sterilisation process according to aseptic filling machines was applied to demonstrate the sensor functionality. After both, immobilisation and sterilisation, a change in impedance could successfully be detected...|$|R

40|$|AIMS—To {{test the}} {{effectiveness}} and rapidity {{of a pair}} of blood culture bottles in the diagnosis of bacterial and fungal contamination of corneal organ culture media.  METHODS— 761 microbiological analyses of storage media (Inosol and Exosol, Opsia, Toulouse, France), sampled in all phases of the organ culture at 31 °C of 410  consecutive corneas, were analysed. Each medium was inoculated in a pair of Bactec Plus Aerobic/F and Bactec Lytic/ 10 Anaerobic/F blood bottles and placed in a Bactec 9240  incubator for 14  days at 37 °C and in a Sabouraud broth at 20 °C. Changes in colour or turbidity of storage media were evaluated daily at the corneal bank. Recipients were screened post-graft for infectious signs.  RESULTS—Overall contamination rate was 2. 4 % (18 / 761). Contamination was detected in less than 1  day in 78 % (14 / 18) and less than 2  days in 94 % (17 / 18). Positivity of the microbiological controls of starting media preceded changes medium colour in 10  out of 14  cases.

Some species of fungi grow and colonize the surface promoting a darkened color and destroying the film of the ink.

The constant emergence of fungi in walls of the recently painted residences became the objective of research of the present work. During the tests, fungi from contaminated walls of recently painted (eight months) residences were isolated and then inoculated in plates containing water-agar (WA) culture medium as control and other plates containing biocides or inks with biocides. The results showed that some isolates presented a little development in polyvinyl acrylic (PVA) latex-based inks containing biocides while others presented an increase in the development of colonies correlated with greater sporulation. Thus, it can be concluded that the concentration of biocides in the inks was insufficient or presented an inefficiency of the germicidal agents (bactericidal and fungicide), demonstrating that the fungi acquired resistance to the biocides...|$|R

The reference setup is explained in detail and a short presentation of the cycle development and the relevant plasma control parameters is given, with a special focus on the in-process monitor determining the cycle validity. Different microbial inactivation mechanisms are also discussed and evaluated for their contribution and interaction to enhance plasma decontamination. A material-dependent inactivation behavior was observed.

40|$|The {{formation}} of D-amino acids (D-aa) in many fermented foods depends, among other factors, {{on the particular}} fermentation conditions, the action and autolysis of the microorganisms involved. In this sense, the analysis of chiral amino acids is an interesting analytical strategy for food scientists, since these compounds {{can be used as}} bacterial markers and can help e. g., to detect adulterations, <b>microbiological</b> <b>contaminations,</b> etc. In this work, a fast and sensitive method based on micellar electrokinetic chromatography with laser induced fluorescence (MEKC-LIF) has been developed to analyze and quantitate L- and D-aa in vinegars. The chiral-MEKC-LIF procedure uses 100 mM sodium tetraborate, 30 mM SDS and 20 mM -CD at pH 9. 7 as running buffer, obtaining a good separation of the main vinegar L/D amino acids previously derivatized with fluorescein isothiocianate. Namely, L/D proline, alanine, arginine, glutamic and aspartic acid, plus the non chiral amino acid -aminobutyric acid are separated in less than 20 min with high efficiency (up to 720, 000 plates/m) and good sensitivity (LODs lower than 16. 6 nM were achieved). Several D-aa were detected and quantified in balsamic, sherry, white wine, and cider vinegars using this MEKC-LIF procedure, observing interesting differences in their L- and D-aa profiles and contents.

40|$|Accurate {{detection}} and quantification of <b>microbiological</b> <b>contaminations</b> remains an issue mainly due {{the lack of}} rapid and precise analytical techniques. Standard methods are expensive and time-consuming being associated to high economic losses and public health threats. In the context of pharmaceutical industry, the development of fast analytical techniques able to overcome these limitations is crucial and spectroscopic techniques might constitute a reliable alternative. In this work we proved the ability of Fourier transform near infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) to detect and quantify bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus epidermidis) from 10 - 108 CFUs/mL in sterile saline solutions (NaCl 0. 9 %). Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) models showed that FT-NIRS was able to discriminate between sterile and contaminated solutions for all bacteria {{as well as to}} identify contaminant bacteria. Partial least squares (PLS) models allowed bacterial quantification with limits of detection ranging from 5. 1 to 9 CFU/mL for E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively. This methodology was successfully validated in three pharmaceutical preparations (contact lens solution, cough syrup and topic anti-inflammatory solution) proving that this technique possess a high potential to be routinely used for the {{detection and}} quantification of bacterial contaminations.

40|$|Background: Access to {{improved}} {{water and sanitation}} are key measures of the World Health Organizations. However, while a community can be classified as having access {{to improved}} water and sanitation, the possibility of <b>microbiological</b> <b>contaminations</b> exists. Globally, {{there is a need}} to assess the quality of drinking water to better classify levels of microbiological quality in attempts to reduce diarrheal disease burden. Utilizing the test for hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) producing bacteria test is a cost effective and easy to use method that may be comparable to the traditional yet more costly method (IDEXX Colilert Quantitray). Due to a paucity of data on the test for H 2 S producing bacteria, this study was performed to examine how well the test for hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) producing bacteria compared to traditional measure of fecal indicator bacteria total coliforms and E. coli in drinking water. Furthermore, an analysis of the ability of the test for H 2 S producing bacteria to predict diarrheal disease was also examined. Methods: The following conditions for the H 2 S were examined in the study: 2 volumes (10 mL or 90 mL), 2 incubation times (24 and 48 hours) and the use of a semi-quantitative scoring system that measured the intensity of the black precipitate formed (H 2 S). To examine how well these conditions compared to E. coli and total coliform results, the following analyses were performed: 1) analysis of sensitivity and specificity to examine presence/absence of bacteria in both samples, 2) linear regression to examine how well a semi-quantitative H 2 S scoring system predicted bacterial concentrations and 3) logistic regression to examine how well the H 2 S test predicted risk of diarrheal disease. Results: Within the dataset, there were 816 observations among the 7 communities involved in the study. The H 2 S test condition that had the highest sensitivity and specificity (94. 23...|$|R
