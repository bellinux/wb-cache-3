500|$|The British {{establishment}} too was not {{disturbed by}} these plans of resistance against the salt tax. The Viceroy himself, Lord Irwin, {{did not take}} the threat of a salt protest seriously, writing to London, [...] "At present the prospect of a salt campaign does not keep <b>me</b> <b>awake</b> at night." ...|$|E
500|$|Based on the {{positive}} response he had received in San Francisco, MGM again cast Tracy as a priest in Boys Town (1938). Portraying Edward J. Flanagan, a Catholic priest and founder of Boys Town, was a role Tracy took seriously: [...] "I'm so anxious {{to do a good}} job as Father Flanagan that it worries me, keeps <b>me</b> <b>awake</b> at night." [...] Tracy received strong reviews for his performance, and the movie grossed $4 million worldwide. For the second year running, Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was humble about the recognition, saying in his acceptance speech: [...] "I honestly do not feel that I can accept this award... I can accept it only as it was meant to be for a great man—Father Flanagan". He immediately sent the Academy Award statuette to Flanagan. Tracy was listed as the fifth biggest money-making star of 1938.|$|E

500|$|At one point, {{shooting}} {{was to take}} place at a bridge overlooking the Detroit River, which was frozen at the time. The script, however, called for clear and running water, meaning that the crew had to brave dangerously low temperatures and conditions to clear the ice; finally they blew up the ice with dynamite. At another time, the crew spent a week filming on a Detroit street after dark, directly under a nursing home, with huge wind machines blowing for long hours. One evening a glass bottle with a note in it crashed to the ground from an upper floor. The note inside read, [...] "The noise is keeping <b>me</b> <b>awake</b> all night long and I am getting sick. I am dying because of you." [...] John Cameron, second assistant director on the film, would later remark, [...] "I see Crimewave as a real turning point in a certain way, because if you survived that experience, nothing in the business could ever be as hard again." [...] Raimi cited the experience {{as one of the}} least favorite moments of his career.|$|E
2500|$|He {{has lived}} in a Turtle Bay, Manhattan brownstone since writing Gypsy in 1959. Ten years later, while he was playing music he heard {{a knock on the}} door. His neighbor, Katharine Hepburn, was in [...] "bare feet – this angry, red-faced lady" [...] and told him [...] "You have been keeping <b>me</b> <b>awake</b> all night!" [...] (she was {{practicing}} for her musical debut in Coco). When Sondheim asked why she had not asked him to play for her, she said she lost his phone number. According to Sondheim, [...] "My guess is that she wanted to stand there in her bare feet, suffering for her art".|$|E
2500|$|According to Vig, {{the team}} drew {{inspiration}} for {{its name from}} a hostile early comment, when {{a friend of the}} band heard recording material, probably for [...] "Vow" [...] and groaned, [...] "This shit sounds like garbage!" [...] However, according to This Is The Noise That keeps <b>Me</b> <b>Awake,</b> an autobiography of the band, Vig wrote in his 1993 studio journal about the creative process; of working for long periods of time, [...] "without coming up with anything cool... and when you least expect it, it all falls into place." [...] The name derives from the last line of this entry: [...] "I hope that all this garbage will become something beautiful!".|$|E
6000|$|Very soon I {{learned the}} meaning of this hint. I think it was within a week of my wife's funeral that I heard that Sir Thomas Colford, {{together}} with all his relations and those of the deceased lady, were absolutely furious with <b>me.</b> <b>Awaking</b> from my stupor of grief, I wrote a letter to Sir Thomas expressing my deep regret at the misfortune that I had been the innocent means of bringing upon him. To this letter I received a reply by hand, scrawled upon half a sheet of notepaper. It ran:-- ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{forgotten}} to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let down my window-blind. The consequence was, that when the moon, which was full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused <b>me.</b> <b>Awaking</b> {{in the dead of}} night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear. It was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw the curtain.|$|R
5000|$|Oh! Dream of joy! Is this indeedThe light-house top I see?Is {{this the}} hill? Is this the kirk?Is this mine own countree?We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,And I with sobs did pray—O let <b>me</b> be <b>awake,</b> my God!Or let me sleep alway.|$|R
2500|$|Landis {{rode the}} 2006 Tour with the {{constant}} pain from the injury, which he described: [...] "It's bad, it's grinding, it's bone rubbing on bone. Sometimes it's a sharp pain. When I pedal and walk, it comes and goes, but mostly it's an ache, like an arthritis pain. It aches down my leg into my knee. The morning {{is the best}} time, it doesn't hurt too much. But when I walk it hurts, when I ride it hurts. Most {{of the time it}} doesn't keep <b>me</b> <b>awake,</b> but there are nights that it does." [...] During the Tour, Landis was medically approved to take cortisone for this injury, a medication otherwise prohibited in professional cycling for its known potential for abuse. Landis himself called his win [...] "a triumph of persistence" [...] despite the pain.|$|E
60|$|I was {{so tired}} that even my fears {{were not able to}} keep <b>me</b> <b>awake</b> long.|$|E
60|$|Well, I am unspeakably glad to {{have that}} ausgleich off my hands. It has kept <b>me</b> <b>awake</b> nights for anderthalbjahr.|$|E
60|$|No {{more could}} I do that night, but next morning D'Aulon <b>awoke</b> <b>me</b> {{a little after}} dawn.|$|R
6000|$|I {{walked with}} her I love by the sea, [...] The deep {{came up with}} its {{chanting}} waves, [...] Making a music so great and free [...] That the will and the faith, which were dead in <b>me,</b> [...] <b>Awoke</b> and rose from their graves.|$|R

60|$|What {{an evening}} of evenings this has been! Last night it was crying that kept <b>me</b> <b>awake.</b> To-night I can't sleep for joy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{that was}} the fellow that kept <b>me</b> <b>awake</b> this morning, and made me wonder if I {{was strong enough to}} hold a gun again." ...|$|E
60|$|CLIPTON. He keeps <b>me</b> <b>awake.</b> I don't {{know who}} he is. [With contempt] One of this star class, I expect. Oughtn't {{to be here with}} us.|$|E
6000|$|Lady. Nay, gentle shepherd, ill is {{lost that}} praise [...] That is {{addressed}} to unattending ears. [...] Not any boast of skill, but extreme shift [...] How to regain my severed company, [...] Compelled <b>me</b> to <b>awake</b> the courteous Echo [...] To give me answer from her mossy couch.|$|R
60|$|Sleep for a {{long time}} fled my eyelids; and just as I was {{beginning}} to feel quiet stealing over my limbs, and settling densely on my mind, a noise at my head startled <b>me</b> broad <b>awake</b> again, and, I will frankly confess it, brought my heart into my mouth.|$|R
6000|$|Lady. Nay, gentle shepherd, ill is {{lost that}} praise [...] That is {{addressed}} to unattending ears.

6000|$|September 4.--Same as yesterday. Paradise Lost. Dined {{with the}} [...] bishop. Cards at night. I like them not, for they excite and keep [...] <b>me</b> <b>awake.</b> Construing Sophocles.|$|E
6000|$|... "To-morrow night," [...] she promised. [...] "When I get up {{it will be}} to go to bed. Even your love-making, Sir Leslie, {{could not}} keep <b>me</b> <b>awake</b> to-night." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I first {{tasted the}} {{loneliness}} to which on that fair morning I had vowed myself. The desolation of it touched <b>me</b> and <b>awoke</b> self-pity in my heart, to extinguish utterly the faint flame of ecstasy that had warmed me when first I thought {{of taking the}} dead anchorite's place.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile I abode {{there with}} Luisina. I {{was in no}} haste to let her go. Her {{presence}} pleased me in some subtle, quite indefinable manner; and my sense of beauty, which, always strong, had hitherto lain dormant within <b>me,</b> was <b>awake</b> at last and was finding nourishment in the graces of her.|$|R
60|$|Shots <b>awoke</b> <b>me,</b> I think, distant shots. And {{they sounded}} like the ripping and tearing of cloth for a wound. 'Twas no new sound to me.|$|R
6000|$|Yet others rapt in {{pleasure}} seem, [...] And {{taste of}} all that I forsake: Oh! may they still of transport dream, [...] And ne'er, at least like <b>me,</b> <b>awake!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{music was}} different," [...] he murmured. [...] "It went--I cannot {{describe}} it; {{but it was}} infinitely richer and more varied than any music that has ever come to <b>me</b> <b>awake.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, but if I don't read, I think, {{and that}} keeps <b>me</b> <b>awake</b> worse. Of course, I respect General Triscoe {{for being in}} the war, and getting wounded," [...] the boy suggested.|$|E
60|$|Kalaua {{left the}} room and went out hurriedly. I turned on my bed and tried to sleep. But try as I would, my leg still kept <b>me</b> {{persistently}} <b>awake.</b> Frank was soon snoring soundly in his own room next door. I envied him his rest, and gave myself up to a sleepless night with what resignation I could manage to summon.|$|R
60|$|She {{answered}} {{with such a}} start, that it quite <b>awoke</b> <b>me.</b> And then she stopped in her work, and looked at me, with her needle drawn out to its thread's length.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is not {{a breath}} of wind," [...] he muttered; [...] "why didst <b>awake</b> <b>me,</b> Maso?--One that hath led thy life should know that sleep is sweet to those who toil." ...|$|R
