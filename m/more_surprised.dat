25|$|According to his uncle, Ernest Morphy, no one {{formally}} taught Morphy {{how to play}} chess; rather, Morphy {{learned on}} his own {{as a young child}} simply from watching others play. After silently watching a lengthy game between Ernest and Alonzo, which they abandoned as drawn, young Paul surprised them by stating that Ernest should have won. His father and uncle had not realized that Paul knew the moves, let alone any chess strategy. They were even <b>more</b> <b>surprised</b> when Paul proved his claim by resetting the pieces and demonstrating the win his uncle had missed.|$|E
25|$|Josie {{arrives in}} Albert Square in August 1998 {{to visit her}} son, Mick McFarlane (Sylvester Williams) whom she {{believes}} {{to be a successful}} musician. However, Mick's music career failed and he has ended up selling CD's on a market stall in the Square, as well as running the Bridge Street café's night bistro. Josie, who has high aspirations for herself and her family, is not pleased to find out that her son has been lying about his professional status, but Josie also harbours a few secrets of her own. Josie's husband recently died, but before his death he was defrauded in a Jamaican property scam, leaving Josie bankrupt. Josie fosters a young girl named Kim (Krystle Williams), whom she claims is a distant relative of Mick's. Kim is the illegitimate daughter of her philandering husband, and after her mother's death, Josie kindly took her in instead of seeing her go into care. When Mick is finally made privy to this information he is extremely shocked and even <b>more</b> <b>surprised</b> to find out that both Josie and Kim plan to stay in Walford instead of returning to Jamaica. Despite his initial misgivings, Mick soon welcomes his mother and new sister into his home. Josie and Kim later move into number 3c Albert Square, where Josie becomes friendly with her downstairs neighbours, Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh), although Josie and Dot bicker constantly.|$|E
500|$|Bax was knighted in 1937; he {{had neither}} {{expected}} nor sought the honour, and was <b>more</b> <b>surprised</b> than delighted to receive it. As the decade progressed, he became less prolific; he commented {{that he wanted}} to [...] "retire, like a grocer". [...] Among his compositions from the period was the Violin Concerto (1938). Although not written to commission, he had composed it with the violin virtuoso Jascha Heifetz in mind. Heifetz never played it, and it was premiered in 1942 by Eda Kersey with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Wood.|$|E

500|$|Since 2016, Chabon {{has been}} {{an outspoken critic of}} Donald Trump, both during his {{campaign}} for the presidency (signing a petition with over 400 other writers against his presidency in May 2016), and during his administration. During an interview with The Guardian before Trump's inauguration in January 2017, Chabon remarked of the incoming president, [...] "I really have no idea what to expect. He’s so unpredictable. He’s so mercurial. You know, I would be no <b>more</b> <b>surprised</b> if he stood up there and declared amnesty for all illegal immigrants to the United States than if {{he said he was going}} to take them all out to be shot. He’s like a random impulse generator." [...] In a 2017 radio interview, Chabon spoke of President Trump and said: “Every morning I wake up and in the seconds before I turn my phone on to see what the latest news is, I have this boundless sense of optimism and hope that this is the day that he’s going to have a massive stroke, and, you know, be carted out of the White House on a gurney." ...|$|E
500|$|Borussia {{were drawn}} against Slovan Liberec of the Czech Republic in the quarter–finals, {{the first leg}} was drawn 0–0 draw in Prague. The draw was {{significant}} {{because it was the}} first time in the competition, that Liberec had failed to win at home. Dortmund won the second leg 4–0, after goals from Márcio Amoroso on 51 minutes, Jan Koller on 57 minutes, Lars Ricken on 70 minutes, and finally Ewerthon on 89 minutes. Borussia faced stronger opponents in the semi-finals, when they were drawn with the then five times champions of Europe; Milan. Nevertheless, Borussia won the first leg 4–0, after a hat-trick from Márcio Amoroso, and a goal on 63 minutes from Jörg Heinrich. Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti admitted he was not surprised with the result, stating that, [...] "We knew they had quick strikers. I am <b>more</b> <b>surprised</b> by the terrible performance of our team. The problem stemmed from the wings. I had no reason to change the team because Rui Costa has not trained for ten days. It will be very difficult but it is our duty to give it our best and to try and qualify." [...] In the second leg, Milan won 3–1, with Filippo Inzaghi, and Cosmin Contra scoring within 18 minutes. However, Milan did not get their third goal until injury time when Serginho scored a penalty after Inzaghi was adjudged to have been pulled back by Christoph Metzelder. With Milan still needing one goal to force extra time, Lars Ricken scored for Dortmund in the fourth minute of injury time to put the club into their first European final since winning the 1997 Champions League Final.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{interpretation}} of the KL divergence is the [...] "unnecessary surprise" [...] introduced by a prior from the truth: suppose a number X {{is about to be}} drawn randomly from a discrete set with probability distribution p(x). [...] If Alice knows the true distribution p(x), while Bob believes (has a prior) that the distribution is q(x), then Bob will be <b>more</b> <b>surprised</b> than Alice, on average, upon seeing the value of X. [...] The KL divergence is the (objective) expected value of Bob's (subjective) surprisal minus Alice's surprisal, measured in bits if the log is in base 2. [...] In this way, the extent to which Bob's prior is [...] "wrong" [...] can be quantified in terms of how [...] "unnecessarily surprised" [...] it is expected to make him.|$|E

Towards the end, he is again cycling, this time down the wrong way of a one-way street, when he actually gets hit by the new Turbot II. <b>More</b> <b>surprised</b> than anything else, stretched out on the front of the car, he simply tells Spirou and Fantasio that they are requested back at the Spirou offices.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout this time, Reeve {{kept his}} body as {{physically}} strong as possible by using specialized exercise machines. He did this both because {{he believed that the}} nervous system could be regenerated through intense physical therapy, and because he wanted his body to be strong enough to support itself if a cure was found. In 2000, he began to regain some motor function, and was able to sense hot and cold temperatures on his body. His doctor, John McDonald of Washington University in St. Louis, asked him if anything was new with his recovery. Reeve then moved his left index finger on command. [...] "I don't think Dr. McDonald would have been <b>more</b> <b>surprised</b> if I had just walked on water," [...] said Reeve in an interview. Also, during that year, he made guest appearances on the long-running PBS series Sesame Street.|$|E
2500|$|Sometime around 1515 Willaert {{first went}} to Rome. [...] An anecdote survives that {{indicates}} the musical ability of the young composer: [...] Willaert was surprised to discover the choir of the papal chapel singing {{one of his own}} compositions, most likely the six-part motet Verbum bonum et suave, and even <b>more</b> <b>surprised</b> to learn that they thought it had been written by the much more famous composer Josquin. [...] When he informed the singers of their error – that he was in fact the composer – they refused to sing it again. [...] Indeed, Willaert's early style is very similar to that of Josquin, with smooth polyphony, balanced voices and frequent use of imitation or strict canon. Indeed the early Willaert admired Josquin so much that he wrote a mass, Missa Mente Tota, in double canon throughout with two free voices, based upon a movement of a famous Josquin motet (Vultum tuum deprecabuntur).|$|E

2500|$|Burnside {{originally}} planned to cross his army east of Fredericksburg at Skinker's Neck, but an advance movement by Federal gunboats to there was fired upon and drew Early's and D.H. Hill's divisions into that area, a movement spotted by Union balloon observers. Now assuming that Lee had anticipated his plan, Burnside guessed that the Confederates had weakened their left and center to concentrate against him on their right. So {{he decided to}} cross directly at Fredericksburg. On December 9, he wrote to Halleck, [...] "I think now the enemy will be <b>more</b> <b>surprised</b> by a crossing immediately in our front than {{any other part of}} the river. ... I'm convinced that a large force of the enemy is now concentrated at Port Royal, its left resting on Fredericksburg, which we hope to turn." [...] In addition to his numerical advantage in troop strength, Burnside also had the advantage of knowing his army could not be attacked effectively. On {{the other side of the}} Rappahannock, 220 artillery pieces had been located on the ridge known as Stafford Heights to prevent Lee's army from mounting any major counterattacks.|$|E
2500|$|TLC aired {{the last}} episodes of What Not to Wear in Fall 2013.

I hope we touched them as much as they touched me. I hope we touched our viewers... I will always cherish the time I spent on 'WNTW' and be eternally grateful to TLC for a great co-host, amazing crew and an awesome program."

So, I’m <b>more</b> <b>surprised</b> than anyone that we’ve lasted this long.
