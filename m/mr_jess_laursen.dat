5000|$|Originating in 1958, {{the year}} that SME opened, the choraliers {{have always been a}} treasured asset to the SME community. Originally under the {{direction}} of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jess</b> Rose, the choral department was handed over to Daniel Zollars in 1970. Mr. Zollars became quite famous in the community for being not only the SME choral director but also a key varsity football coach. After impacting the lives of thousands throughout his amazing career, Mr. Zollars retired from teaching in 1993. Finding a replacement for Mr. Zollars did not prove to be an easy task. It was no secret that whoever was hired as the SME choral director had some gigantic shoes to fill. Eventually, the administration hired Rika Heruth to fill the position. A very talented musician and soloist, Ms. Heruth seemed to take the SME choral department in a very different direction. While nothing Ms. Heruth did was wrong or bad per se, the members of the community felt rather unsure about her changing the methods that had worked so well in the past and producing a less choral sound than they had been used to. In 1997-98, Ms. Heruth resigned from the position of choral director at Shawnee Mission East and was replaced by Tracy S. Resseguie who, after an 11-year tenure, left Shawnee Mission East after the 07-08 school year. Since the fall of 2008, the SME Choral Department has been under the direction of Ken Foley, who has taken the department in a completely different direction.|$|R
