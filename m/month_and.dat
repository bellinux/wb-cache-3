40|$|Objective:	 To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of demineralized bone matrix (DMBM), an osteoconductive and osteoinductive graft material, as a bone graft for the treatment of osseous defects, both clinically and radiographically. Materials and	Methods:	 The effectiveness of DMBM was assessed at 40 sites in 30 patients who had infrabony defects. Grafted test sites were compared with control sites treated with open-flap debridement. Results: Significant improvement in all variables was found, including reduction of probing depth, and gain in clinical attachment level and bone fill for test and control sites at 3 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months</b> postoperatively. For test sites, reduction of probing depth was 2. 80 mm at 3 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 4. 05 mm at 6 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> for control sites, 1. 75 mm at 3 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 2. 65 mm at 6 months. Gain in the level of clinical attachment for test sites was 2. 80 mm at 3 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 4. 00 mm at 6 months; for control sites, this gain was 1. 75 mm at 3 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 2. 60 mm at 6 months. The mean amount of defect resolution was 2. 02 mm and 3. 27 mm for test sites and 0. 82 mm and 1. 17 mm for control sites, at 3 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months,</b> respectively. The mean percentage of defect resolution was 37. 1 % and 56. 5 % for test sites compared with 20. 5 % and 28. 6 % for control sites, at 3 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months,</b> respectively. �onclusions: DMBM improves healing outcomes, namely, reduction of probing depth, resolution of osseous defects and gain in clinical attachment, compared with open flap debridement.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This was a {{retrospective}} {{review of the}} long-term results of femorotibial bypass using autologous vein and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) over 24 years. METHODS: Some 518 patients who underwent 635 femorotibial bypass grafts were studied. Outcome measures analysed included primary and secondary graft patency, limb salvage rates and death. RESULTS: Overall primary and secondary graft patencies were 62 and 67 per cent respectively at 12 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> 44 and 48 per cent at 24 months. For vein grafts, the primary and secondary patencies were 63 and 66 per cent at 12 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> 54 and 56 per cent at 24 months. For PTFE grafts, the primary and secondary patencies were 48 and 54 per cent at 12 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> 31 and 37 per cent at 24 <b>months.</b> Limb salvage <b>and</b> patient survival rates were 81 and 84 per cent at 12 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> 73 and 74 per cent at 24 <b>months.</b> Primary <b>and</b> secondary graft patencies for vein were significantly better than for PTFE (P = 0. 0001). There {{was no difference in}} patency between reversed and in situ grafts. CONCLUSION: Femorotibial bypass can produce excellent long-term results. Vein remains the conduit of choice but in the absence of vein acceptable results can be achieved with PTFE. Sayers, R D; Raptis, S; Berce, M; Miller, J...|$|R
