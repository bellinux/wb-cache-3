40|$|Sonic Infrared Imaging (SIR) {{technology}} {{is a relatively new}} NDE technique that has received significant acceptance in the NDE community. SIR NDE is a super-fast, wide range NDE method. The technology uses short pulses of ultrasonic excitation together with infrared imaging to detect defects in the structures under inspection. Defects become visible to the IR camera when the temperature in the crack vicinity increases due to various heating mechanisms in the specimen. Defect detection is highly affected by noise levels as well as <b>mode</b> <b>patterns</b> in the image. <b>Mode</b> <b>patterns</b> result from the superposition of sonic waves interfering within the specimen during the sound pulse. <b>Mode</b> <b>patterns</b> can be a serious concern, especially in composite structures. <b>Mode</b> <b>patterns</b> can either mimic real defects in the specimen, or alternatively, hide defects if they overlap. In last year’s QNDE, we have presented algorithms to improve defects detectability in severe noise. In this paper, we will present our development of algorithms on defect extraction targeting specifically to <b>mode</b> <b>patterns</b> in SIR images...|$|R

The phenomena observed include vortices which move along circular or spiral trajectories and vortices which periodically change {{the sign of}} their topological charge. In addition, we observe behavior which is unlike that expected for lasers, despite the established analogy between the laser and the PRO. This includes pulsing of <b>mode</b> <b>patterns</b> which are otherwise expected to be stable, and also stable rotation of Gauss-Laguerre <b>mode</b> <b>patterns.</b> These effects indicate a much stronger self-focusing in the PRO than in lasers...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{investigate}} {{the response of}} a simple atmospheric general circulation model to applied forcings to learn whether the annular <b>mode</b> <b>patterns</b> are a preferred model response to the forcings. The thesis is inspired {{by the appearance of}} annular <b>mode</b> <b>patterns</b> in Earth's atmosphere in response to a number of forcings. Climatologies of the model under the influence of applied torques or perturbations to the reference temperature profile are compiled and compared to a control run with neither type of forcing. In most cases the differences in climatologies are annular mode-like, suggesting the patterns are the preferred response of the model to the forcings. The strength of the response typically increases for either an increase in the strength of the forcing, or an increase in the strength of the projection of the forcing on the model's annular <b>mode</b> <b>patterns.</b> Trials with a response which was not annular mode-like usually featured a poor projection of the forcing on the annular modes, or substantial interference with tropical dynamics. A zonally symmetric version of the model is also used to test the direct response of the model to the forcing versus the response caused by changes in eddy feedback processes. The direct forcing alone is found to be insufficient to produce either the correct strength or shape of the annular <b>mode</b> <b>patterns.</b> Instead the changes in eddy fluxes must be included to produce the correct shape and amplitude of the anomalies. by Michael John Ring.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{strongly}} deformed microcavity with fully chaotic ray dynamics cannot support high-Q modes due to its fast chaotic diffusion to the critical line of refractive emission. Here, we investigate how the Q factor is modified when two chaotic cavities are coupled, and show that some modes, whose Q factor is about 10 times higher than that of the corresponding single cavity, can exist. These abnormal high-Q modes are the result of an optimal combination of coupling and cavity geometry. As an example, in the coupled stadium-shaped microcavities, the <b>mode</b> <b>pattern</b> extends over both cavities such that it follows a whispering-gallery-type mode at both ends, whereas a big coupling spot forms at the closest contact of the two microcavities. The pattern of such a 'rounded bow tie' mode allows the mode to have a high-Q factor. This <b>mode</b> <b>pattern</b> minimizes the leakage of light {{at both ends of the}} microcavities as the pattern at both ends is similar to whispering gallery mode.
