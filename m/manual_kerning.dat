5000|$|<b>Manual</b> <b>kerning</b> for {{letters and}} manual {{positioning}} of diacritics, explicitly (per word) or as document settings (per font).|$|E
50|$|When {{employed}} by a skilled person, <b>manual</b> <b>kerning</b> will usually give better results than optical kerning; for example, some characters that {{may appear to}} an algorithmic comparison to be spaced very closely together may appear to a human reader too far apart, especially when the only element of a glyph that is “too close” is a diacritic mark. <b>Manual</b> <b>kerning</b> may even {{be better than the}} metric kerning built into the kerning table by the font's designer, since these tables often have errors or omissions, or the difference may simply be a matter of personal preference.|$|E
50|$|Contextual kerning is {{supported}} by the OpenType font format, but few font designers implement it, and probably no desktop publishing systems can currently use it. When important, the solution for a user is to employ <b>manual</b> <b>kerning</b> instead.|$|E
50|$|Version 2 of Timeworks Publisher {{included}} full WYSIWYG, paragraph tagging, <b>manual</b> {{control of}} <b>kerning,</b> text and graphics imports and more fonts.|$|R
50|$|The {{scientific}} study of Buddhism began in the Netherlands with the appointment of Hendrik Kern as the first professor for the chair for Sanskrit at Leiden University. He published two histories and a <b>manual</b> of Buddhism. <b>Kern,</b> like Émile Senart, portrayed the Buddha as a legendary being or a hero representing the sun. Kern was succeeded by Jacob Speyer (1849-1913), who translated several Mahayana texts and the Jatakamala for the series ‘The Sacred Books of the Buddhists’. The subsequent chair, Jean Philippe Vogel (1871-1958), became famous as an archaeologist by proving that Kasia in India must have been Kusinara, {{the place of the}} Parinirvana of the Buddha. He also conducted investigations on the Borobudur, the great Buddhist monument on the Isle of Java.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Three {{versions}} of [...] "WAR" [...] in the Clarendon typeface: The top version has no kerning, the middle version has automatic kerning {{as might be}} applied by a particular program, and the bottom version has <b>manual</b> <b>kerning.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Manual</b> <b>kerning,</b> {{available}} in some systems, permits {{the user to}} override the automatic kerning and to apply any kerning value directly {{to a pair of}} characters in a particular place in the text. When not available, this feature can be simulated by using, for those two characters, the function that modifies the space between characters in a block of text (usually called tracking).|$|E
5000|$|Poorly {{performed}} <b>manual</b> <b>kerning</b> {{can also}} {{result in a}} type of kerning summed up by the slang term [...] "keming" [...] - implying that a person has badly kerned the word [...] "kerning" [...] and has run together the r and the n. Google has a search engine easter egg involving kerning and keming. Searching for [...] "kerning" [...] adds a little space between the letters in every instance of the word [...] "kerning" [...] that appears. Searching for [...] "keming" [...] removes a little space from between the letters in every instance of the word [...] "keming".|$|E
5000|$|MacPublisher {{builds a}} page {{differently}} than PageMaker and ReadySetGo do; instead {{of creating an}} actual image of the page with all the text and graphics, MacPublisher created a page mockup that contains only rectangles that represent the location and size of text and graphic elements, and stored the elements as special text and picture files that you edit separately from the page layout. MacPublisher rebuilds a page whenever it changes. The company says it took this approach to allow creation of master pages, repeating elements, and predefined [...] "canned" [...] page layouts; to help prevent data loss on machines with limited memory (MacPublisher can run with as little as 128K RAM); and to facilitate the programming for the automatic table of contents and automatic page jump ("continued on page x") features. Since the page layout is independent {{of the text and}} graphic content, you can easily create publication formats you can reuse as you need them. This reusable formats feature can be especially useful for creating catalogs or other publications in which you want the format to remain the same but in which you need to update or replace information on a regular basis. MacPublisher features either automatic or <b>manual</b> <b>kerning</b> to correct printer spacing idiosyncrasies.|$|E
