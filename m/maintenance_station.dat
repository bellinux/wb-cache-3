30|$|In this paper, {{instead of}} the {{classical}} approach to the multi-criteria location selection problem, a new approach was presented based on selecting a portfolio of locations. First, the indices affecting the selection of <b>maintenance</b> <b>stations</b> were collected. The K-means model was used for clustering the <b>maintenance</b> <b>stations.</b> The optimal number of clusters was calculated through the Silhouette index. The efficiency of each cluster of stations was determined using the Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes input-oriented data envelopment analysis model. A bi-objective zero one programming model was used to select a Pareto optimal combination of rank and distance of stations. The Pareto solutions for the presented bi-objective model were determined using the invasive weed optimization method. Although the proposed methodology is meant for the selection of repair and <b>maintenance</b> <b>stations</b> in an oil refinery Company, {{it can be used}} in multi-criteria decision-making problems.|$|R

30|$|A zero–one bi-objective {{programming}} {{model was}} developed. The first objective in model was {{to maximize the}} rank of the locations, and the second objective was to minimize the distance of <b>maintenance</b> <b>stations</b> from the studied locations.
