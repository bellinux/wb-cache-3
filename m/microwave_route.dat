40|$|Microwave heating {{presents}} a faster, lower energy synthetic methodology for {{the realization of}} functional materials. Here, we demonstrate {{for the first time}} that employing this method also leads to a decrease in the occurrence of defects in olivine structured LiFe 1 −xMnxPO 4. For example, the presence of antisite defects in this structure precludes Li+ diffusion along the b-axis leading to a significant decrease in reversible capacities. Total scattering measurements, in combination with Li+ diffusion studies using muon spin relaxation (μ+SR) spectroscopy, reveal that this synthetic method generates fewer defects in the nanostructures compared to traditional solvothermal routes. Our interest in developing these routes to mixed-metal phosphate LiFe 1 −xMnxPO 4 olivines is due to the higher Mn 2 +/ 3 + redox potential in comparison to the Fe 2 +/ 3 + pair. Here, single-phase LiFe 1 −xMnxPO 4 (x = 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1) olivines have been prepared following a microwave-assisted approach which allows for up to 4 times faster reaction times compared to traditional solvothermal methods.

40|$|This paper reports {{investigation}} of Na 2 O and ZnO modified borovanadate glasses {{in the highly}} modified regime of compositions. These glasses have been prepared by <b>microwave</b> <b>route.</b> Ultraviolet (UV) and visible, infrared (IR), Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS NMR) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopies {{have been used to}} characterize the speciation in the glasses. Together with the variation of properties such as molar volume and glass transition temperatures, spectroscopic data indicate that at high levels of modification, ZnO tends to behave like network former. It is proposed that the observed variation of all the properties can be reasonably well understood with a structural model. The model considers that the modification and speciation in glasses are strongly determined by the hierarchy of group electronegativities. Further, it is proposed that the width of the transitions of glasses obtained under same condition reflects the fragility of the glasses. An empirical expression has been suggested to quantify fragility on the basis of width of the transition regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
