5000|$|A {{pioneer of}} the {{environmental}} <b>movement,</b> Udall <b>warned</b> <b>of</b> a conservation crisis in the 1960s with his best-selling book on environmental attitudes in the United States, The Quiet Crisis (1963). In the book, he wrote {{about the dangers of}} pollution, overuse of natural resources, and dwindling open spaces. Along with Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, The Quiet Crisis is credited with creating a consciousness in the country that led to the environmental movement. Udall was a staunch supporter of Rachel Carson and her work. Stewart Udall once stated, [...] "Plans to protect air and water, wilderness and wildlife are in fact, plans to protect Man." ...|$|R
40|$|Apart {{from the}} {{positive}} effects, which {{are reflected in}} the relative improvement of the quality of life, the way households satisfy their needs has a direct impact on many environmental problems. Among them are global climatic changes, air, soil and water pollution, excessive usage of natural resources and loss of biodiversity. Sustainable consumption belongs to the key elements of global movement for sustainable development. It can be characterized as consumer behaviour which satisfies the needs of current and future generations. Czech households influence the environment every day by doing their shopping, consuming and using various kinds of products and services, the way they spend their leisure time, by commuting to work and travelling in general and, last but not the least, by producing waste. Both the location {{and the size of the}} household significantly influence the environment as well. 30 to 40 % of environmental problems are caused by households. Thus, pro-environmental <b>movements</b> <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> the necessity to eliminate negative impacts of households’ behaviour. This paper analyses development tendencies of relevant indicators of household operations which have impact on the environment. The attention is paid primarily to consumption of electrical energy, water and food by households, usage of personal means of transport and production of communal waste. Time series statistical methods were used when assessing development tendencies...|$|R
5000|$|The {{founders of}} the {{university}} hoped to produce alumni committed to Jewish tradition, Zionist ideology and science. In 1965, the professors and lecturers were all religious Jews, as were the majority of students. Yosef Burg, one of the prominent leaders of the religious Zionist <b>movement</b> <b>warned</b> that admission <b>of</b> too many non-religious into the university could undermine its character: [...] "If you spill too much water into a wine bottle, you will have no wine." [...] Today, the student population includes secular and non-Jewish students, including Arabs. In the past, all Jewish male students were required to cover their heads, {{but this is no}} longer the case. Seven courses in Jewish studies are required for graduation. In hiring senior academic staff, the university gives preference to religious Jews, although the faculty includes many secular members.|$|R
