5|$|In {{downtown}} Adrian, {{the highways}} previously split into an uncommon arrangement of one-way streets. This arrangement {{was similar to}} a traffic circle in how the traffic was routed through the central business district on Church, Broad, Front and Winter streets. The first one-way pairing started on <b>Main</b> <b>Street</b> at the intersection with Winter Street. Northbound traffic continued on <b>Main</b> <b>Street,</b> while southbound traffic was routed along Winter Street. At Church Street, westbound Bus. US223/northbound M-52 turned east for a block on Church and then north onto Broad Street. Then the highway designations continued on Broad Street three blocks north to Front Street, passing {{to the east of}} the downtown businesses. The designations were then routed west along Front Street. At <b>Main</b> <b>Street,</b> M-52 turned back north again as a two-way street. In the opposite direction, southbound M-52 traffic was diverted from Main west on Front Street. Front Street west of <b>Main</b> <b>Street</b> carried southbound M-52 and westbound Bus. US223 traffic one block west to Winter Street, which then turned down Winter. Westbound Bus. US223 traffic turned west along Maumee Street while eastbound Bus. US223 followed southbound M-52 down Winter to <b>Main</b> <b>Street.</b> This arrangement was ended in November 2009 when the City of Adrian converted all of the one-way streets to two-way traffic. Downtown streets had been converted to one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973.|$|E
