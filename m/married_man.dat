40|$|In {{standard}} cross-sectional wage regressions, <b>married</b> <b>men</b> {{appear to}} earn 10 to 20 % more than comparable never <b>married</b> <b>men.</b> One proposed {{explanation for this}} male marriage premium is that men may be selected into marriage {{on the basis of}} characteristics valued by employers as well as by spouses or because they earn high wages. This paper examines the selection hypothesis by focusing on shotgun weddings, which may make marital status uncorrelated with earnings ability. We compare the estimated marriage premium between white men whose first marriages are soon followed by a birth and other <b>married</b> white <b>men</b> in the United States. The return to marriage differs little for <b>married</b> <b>men</b> with a premarital conception and other <b>married</b> <b>men,</b> and the results suggest that at most 10 % of the estimated marriage premium is due to selection.

5|$|Divine {{considered}} {{himself to be}} male, and was not transgender or transsexual. He was gay, and during the 1980s had an extended relationship with a <b>married</b> <b>man</b> named Lee, who accompanied him almost everywhere that he went. They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair with gay porn star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press. According to his manager Bernard Jay, Divine regularly engaged in sexual activities with young men that he would meet while on tour, sometimes becoming infatuated with them; in one case, he met {{a young man in}} Israel whom he wanted to bring back to the United States, but was prevented from doing so by Jay. This image of promiscuity was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited such behavior when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the media about his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes hint that he was bisexual, but {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s changed this attitude and began being open about his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of his manager, realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.|$|E

While {{he is also}} trying to save himself in the movie, his greater concern is uncovering the story behind his son's disappearance. Spielberg would later transform his next science fiction film, War of the Worlds, from a story about a single man to one about a divorced father concerned with protecting his children. Buckland notes that the two tragic parent-child relationships in the picture (Agatha and Ann Lively, John and Sean Anderton) have a common element. The movie has four shots of them submerged in water. Agatha's face is shown in a close up shot, taken from directly above her, when she is submerged in her photon milk, nutrient bath. When photos of her mother's submerged corpse are shown to her, the emphasized photograph is a similar image of her face taken from directly above. Anderton and his son are shown together in a pool flashback scene in which they have a contest to see who can hold their breath longest. John is underwater when his son is taken, and later in the apartment he is shown lying motionless, immersed in a filled bathtub, in a manner Buckland finds similar to the shots of Agatha and Ann. Buckland notes that co-screenwriter Frank introduced the water theme, as he wrote Agatha and her mother's back stories while adding the bathtub scene.|$|E

40|$|This article investigates how {{marriage}} {{affects the}} wages of men in Germany. A variety of reasons have been proposed for why <b>married</b> <b>men</b> earn higher wages than single men; however, previous tests of the leading explanations have been inconclusive.

In contrast to the popular household specialization hypothesis, men do not substantially reduce their housework time following marriage; neither does the housework time significantly affect the wage rate. This finding contrasts the prevailing view that the wage differential between <b>married</b> and single <b>men</b> results from the division of labour within the household. However, <b>men</b> <b>married</b> to non-working partners receive a larger wage premium than <b>men</b> <b>married</b> to full-time working wives. It is further shown that <b>married</b> <b>men</b> feel less satisfied with their financial situation as compared to their single counterparts. These results indicate that a lower level of pay satisfaction induce <b>married</b> <b>men</b> to put more effort into their work, which leads to higher wages...|$|R
