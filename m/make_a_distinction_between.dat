Those potentially synthetic diamonds require more investigation in a specialized lab. Examples of commercial screening devices are D-Screen (WTOCD / HRD Antwerp) and Alpha Diamond Analyzer (Bruker / HRD Antwerp).|$|E
5|$|Mr. Connors {{is fired}} by the school board due to the {{violence}} associated with wrestling, after the board fails to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> what he teaches and professional wrestling (as do the town bar regulars). They also find videos of Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling on his iPhone and mistake them for gay pornography. The boys are excited to learn WWE Chairman Vince McMahon has heard of their federation and will be scouting one of their shows. Mr. Connors sits in his apartment surrounded by awards for wrestling and in tears over his termination and what wrestling has become. Vengeful, he plans to sabotage the event in a personal vow to restore {{the integrity of the}} wrestling sport. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny secretly decide to relegate Butters, Jimmy and Token to smaller roles, thinking that it will give themselves a better opportunity to impress McMahon. They hold tryouts {{in the manner of a}} theater audition in order to find new talent for their show, which is now more reminiscent of musical theatre than wrestling.|$|E

It is necessary therefore to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> the two situations. The former ones will belong to the dynamic micelles while the latter will be called kinetically frozen micelles.|$|E
25|$|Paeonia corallina is {{a synonym}} of Paeonia mascula, so cannot {{be applied to}} the taxa of P. daurica. According to the most recent taxonomic review of this complex of taxa, no {{morphological}} differences occur that are distinct enough to recognize separate species.

25|$|At {{the present}} stage of CFE theory development, it is {{important}} to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> theoretical CFE equations and an empirical CFE equation. The former are derived from condensed matter physics (albeit in contexts where their detailed development is difficult). An empirical CFE equation, on the other hand, simply attempts to represent the actual experimental form of the dependence of current i on voltage V.|$|E

25|$|Allergies to sulfonamide are common. According to data {{the overall}} {{incidence}} of adverse drug reactions to sulfa antibiotics is approximately 3%, close to penicillin; hence medications containing sulfonamides are prescribed carefully. It {{is important to}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> sulfa drugs and other sulfur-containing drugs and additives, such as sulfates and sulfites, which are chemically unrelated to the sulfonamide group, and do not cause the same hypersensitivity reactions seen in the sulfonamides.|$|E
25|$|Stone {{and bone}} needles found in ancient tombs led Joseph Needham to {{speculate}} that acupuncture might {{have been carried out}} in the Shang dynasty. This being said, most historians now <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> medical lancing (or bloodletting) and acupuncture in the narrower sense of using metal needles to treat illnesses by stimulating specific points along circulation channels ("meridians") in accordance with theories related to the circulation of Qi. The earliest evidence for acupuncture in this sense dates to the second or first century BCE.|$|E
25|$|Hispanophone and Hispanosphere are terms used {{to refer}} to Spanish-language {{speakers}} and the Spanish-speaking world, respectively. The terms derive from the Latin political name of the Iberian Peninsula, Hispania. In addition to the general definition of Hispanophone, some groups in the Hispanic world <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> Castilian-speaking and Spanish-speaking, with the former term denoting the speakers of the Spanish language—also known as Castilian—and the latter the speakers of the Spanish or Hispanic languages (i.e. the languages of Spain or the languages of the Hispanic nations).|$|E

25|$|Compatibilists {{maintain}} that mental reality {{is not of}} itself causally effective. Classical compatibilists have addressed the dilemma of free will by arguing that free will holds {{as long as we}} are not externally constrained or coerced. Modern compatibilists <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> freedom of will and freedom of action, that is, separating freedom of choice from the freedom to enact it. Given that humans all experience a sense of free will, some modern compatibilists think it is necessary to accommodate this intuition. Compatibilists often associate freedom of will with the ability to make rational decisions.|$|E
25|$|Companies usually <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> {{voluntary}} churn and involuntary churn. Voluntary churn occurs due to {{a decision}} by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications, involuntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary churn, because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.|$|E
25|$|Mrs Norris: The officious, skinflint {{older sister}} of Lady Bertram, {{who lives near}} Mansfield Park. Her husband, Mr Norris, was the parson at Mansfield Park until his death. She dislikes Fanny and takes every {{opportunity}} to put her down and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> Fanny's treatment and that of her wealthier cousins. Mrs Norris also takes every opportunity to save money, such as taking jellies and sewing materials from the main house for her own home. Historian and biographer Jon Spence suggested in Becoming Jane Austen that Mrs Norris was based on Austen's sister-in-law Mary Lloyd, who had married James Austen, and who was the younger sister of Austen's close friend Martha Lloyd.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} this device {{is most likely}} is the Greek Byzantium. Many {{credible}} references {{can be found in}} medieval texts. Philo of Byzantium describes in Pneumatica a structure with similar functions. Hero of Alexandria in the 1st century B.C. tried a to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> a bucket-chain and wheel for raising water. However, it must be kept in mind that the principle of axial flow was well known in the Islamic world since 9th century when it was attested by the Banu Musa brothers who, in their Kitab al-hiyal (Book of Ingenious Devices) written in Baghdad in about 850 CE described a horizontal wheel placed in one of their fountains and driven from below by a number of vertical jets of water.|$|E
25|$|All {{the sites}} of Ashokan {{inscription}} were chosen carefully {{to ensure that they}} were accessible to large numbers of people. These edicts are proclamations to the public at large. They explain the idea of Dhamma. One must <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> Ashoka's policy of Dhamma which stressed social responsibility and Ashoka's own commitment as a Buddhist. There has been a tendency in the past among historians to study the policy of Dhamma and Ashoka as Buddhist in the same context without making any distinction. An examination of the inscriptions suggests that Ashoka declared his personal association with a Buddhist order and on the other he tried to teach, through the policy of Dhamma, the importance of social responsibility and tolerance amongst different members of the society.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> {{language}} {{rights and}} linguistic human rights because the former concept covers {{a much wider}} scope. Thus, not all language rights are LHR, although all LHR are language rights. One way of distinguishing language rights from LHR is between what is necessary, and what is enrichment-oriented. Necessary rights, as in human rights, are those needed for basic needs and for living a dignified life, e.g. language-related identity, access to mother tongue(s), right of access to an official language, no enforced language shift, access to formal primary education based on language, and the right for minority groups to perpetuate as a distinct group, with own languages. Enrichment rights are above basic needs, e.g. right to learn foreign languages.|$|E

Stockburger (2003) describes this distinction by using the terms diegetic and non-diegetic. The second dimension <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> sound related to {{the activity of the}} game on one hand, and sound related to the setting of the game on the other.|$|R
