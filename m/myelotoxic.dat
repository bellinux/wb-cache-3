The resulting depletion of myeloid precursors under these conditions appears to be the factor that limits approaches to accelerate immune reconstitution.

Of greatest significance was the demonstration that the protection afforded by CMPs/GMPs was not major histocompatibility complex restricted. Furthermore, the effect of CMP/GMP cellular therapy was additive with that of liposomal amphotericin B treatment. These observations greatly expand the potential donor pool and, thus, the clinical utility of CMP/GMP cellular therapy in patients with myeloid depletion.

Antigen challenge of ovalbumin-sensitized guinea-pigs resulted in a lung eosinophilia which was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage. All three agents caused a marked suppression of lung eosinophilia at 24 h post-challenge when the compounds were administered at the time of sensitization but not when administered for 3 days before lavage. However, the lung eosinophilia at 72 h post-challenge was reduced significantly by FK 506 and by cyclophosphamide, but not by cyclosporin A, when the drugs were administered for 3 days, before lavage. These results strongly suggest the involvement of T cells in antigen-induced late phase (72 h) eosinophilia in guinea-pigs but not at 24 h.

40|$|To better {{define the}} role of {{exposure}} to <b>myelotoxic</b> agents in the genesis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), we carried out (a) a case-control study for {{the determination of the}} relative risk (RR) of developing MDS, including 178 consecutive patients and 178 sex- and age-matched controls: (b) a study of clinicobiological features in MDS arising after occupational exposure to <b>myelotoxic</b> agents and in MDS in 'non-exposed' patients. The definition of the 'exposure' status was based on a predetermined questionnaire, with calculation of an 'exposure' index (hours/day x days/year x years). Cumulative exposure to pesticides or to organic solvents, for > 2400 h, was recorded in 48 and 25 MDS patients, respectively, compared to 27 and four controls (P< 0. 00001; RR 3. 74; 95 % confidence interval 2. 02 - 5. 37). Older age and an excess of refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts and refractory anaemia with excess of blasts was noted among 'exposed' MDS-patients (group 1), compared to non-exposed MDS-patients (group 2). 68. 3 % patients in group 1 had clonal chromosome changes, compared with 43. 2 % patients in group 2. Complex karyotypes, - 7 / 7 q-, - 5 / 5 q-, + 8, 7 p and 17 p aberrations were seen more frequently in group 1, whereas a normal karyotype, isolated 5 q- or 20 q- occurred more frequently in group 2. The association of exposure to <b>myelotoxic</b> agents with older age at presentation and with unfavourable chromosome changes accounted for the shorter survival observed in 'exposed' patients. These data show that occupational exposure to pesticides and organic solvents in our region resulted in an increased RR of developing MDS and that a distinct cytogenetic profile was associated with MDS in 'exposed' patients.

40|$|Ticlopidine, {{clopidogrel}} and prasugrel are thienopyridine derivatives {{used for}} inhibition of platelet aggregation in several cardiovascular diseases. Besides hepatotoxicity, also bone marrow toxicity may limit their use. The mechanisms associated with myelotoxicity of thienopyridines are currently unclear. Uncovering the {{mechanism by which}} thienopyridines lead to these adverse effects is therefore of great importance. In this thesis, three different cell systems which include human hematopoietic stem cells isolated from umbilical cord blood, neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood and human promyelocytic leukemia cell line were used. The main aims of this thesis were to investigate whether the mother substance and/or the active metabolites are responsible for myelotoxicity and whether the inactive clopidogrel metabolite clopidogrel carboxylate contributes to myelotoxicity. Apart from the well-known CYP-mediated metabolism of thienopyridines in liver, MPO present in neutrophils also metabolise clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel, and clopidogrel carboxylate. In contrast, clopidogrel carboxylate was not metabolized by human CYP 3 A 4. MPO-dependant metabolism of clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel, and clopidogrel carboxylate showed dose dependent cytotoxicity. Similarly, CYP 3 A 4 -mediated metabolism showed dose dependent cytotoxicity of all drugs except clopidogrel carboxylate. Taking into account the pharmacokinetics in humans, we conclude that the <b>myelotoxic</b> principle of clopidogrel is most probably associated with metabolite formation from clopidogrel carboxylate by myeloperoxidase.

40|$|Ticlopidine and {{clopidogrel}} are thienopyridine derivatives {{used for}} inhibition of platelet aggregation. Not only hepatotoxicity, but also bone marrow toxicity may limit their use. Aims {{of the study}} were to find out whether non-metabolized drug and/or metabolites are responsible for myelotoxicity and whether the inactive clopidogrel metabolite clopidogrel carboxylate contributes to myelotoxicity. We used myeloid progenitor cells isolated from human umbilical cord blood in a colony-forming unit assay to assess cytotoxicity. Degradation of clopidogrel, clopidogrel carboxylate or ticlopidine (studied at 10 and 100 μM) was monitored using LC/MS. Clopidogrel and ticlopidine were both dose-dependently cytotoxic starting at 10 μM. This was not the case for the major clopidogrel metabolite clopidogrel carboxylate. Pre-incubation with recombinant human CYP 3 A 4 not only caused degradation of clopidogrel and ticlopidine, but also increased cytotoxicity. In contrast, clopidogrel carboxylate was not metabolized by recombinant human CYP 3 A 4. Pre-incubation with freshly isolated human granulocytes was not only associated with a myeloperoxidase-dependent degradation of clopidogrel, clopidogrel carboxylate and ticlopidine, but also with dose-dependent cytotoxicity of these compounds starting at 10 μM. In conclusion, both non-metabolized clopidogrel and ticlopidine as well as metabolites of these compounds are toxic towards myeloid progenitor cells. Taking exposure data in humans into account, the <b>myelotoxic</b> element of clopidogrel therapy is likely to be secondary to the formation of metabolites from clopidogrel carboxylate by myeloperoxidase.

Patients and Methods: Three hundred fifty-five patients with stage IIB, III, or IV HL were randomly assigned. Three hundred thirty-four patients were assessable for the study and received six cycles of ABVD (n = 122), three cycles of Stanford V (n = 107), or six cycles of MOPPEBVCAD (n = 106); radiotherapy was administered to 76, 71, and 50 patients in these three arms, respectively. Results: The complete response rates for ABVD, Stanford V, and MOPPEBVCAD were 89 %, 76 % and 94 %, respectively; 5 -year failure-free survival (FFS) and progression-free survival rates were respectively (P <. 01 for comparison of Stanford V {{with the other two}} regimens).

Paclitaxel was given as a 3 -h infusion on day 1, followed by fixed doses of teniposide (or etoposide) 100 mg/m(2) days 1, 3, 5 and cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) day 1 every 3 weeks. As myelotoxicity was expected to be the dose-limiting toxicity, prophylactic G-CSF and antibiotic support was evaluated. Indeed, paclitaxel 120 mg/m(2) resulted in dose-limiting neutropenia, despite G-CSF support. Teniposide/etoposide day 1, 3, 5 was less <b>myelotoxic</b> compared to day 1, 2, 3. G-CSF support allowed paclitaxel dose-escalation to 250 mg/m(2). The addition of prophylactic antibiotics enabled dose-escalation to 275 mg/m(2) without reaching MTD. In conclusion, G-CSF and antibiotics prophylaxis enables the delivery of a full dosed chemotherapy triplet in previously untreated NSCLC patient...|$|E
40|$|Hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors {{coordinate}} the proliferation and maturation of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells during normal hematopoiesis. Most {{of these factors}} are now available as recombinant human colony-stimulating factors, and preclinical and clinical testing is proceeding rapidly. Granulocyte and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factors {{have been the most}} extensively studied to date. In human clinical trials, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor improves neutrophil counts and function, reduces episodes of febrile neutropenia, improves neutrophil recovery after disease- or treatment-induced myelosuppression, and reduces the number of serious infections in several neutropenic disease states. Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor has similar biological properties but may also improve eosinophil proliferation and function, and platelet cell recovery after <b>myelotoxic</b> bone marrow injury, Interleukin- 1 boosts the effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, but also may promote the resolution of established infections in conjunction with antibiotics. The therapeutic realities and future therapeutic implications of these agents for the therapy of infections, cancer and hemopoietic disorders are discussed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryEstrogens are potent {{regulators}} {{of mature}} hematopoietic cells; however, {{their effects on}} primitive and malignant hematopoietic cells remain unclear. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we observed differential expression and function of estrogen receptors (ERs) in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and progenitor subsets. ERα activation with the selective ER modulator (SERM) tamoxifen induced apoptosis in short-term HSCs and multipotent progenitors. In contrast, tamoxifen induced proliferation of quiescent long-term HSCs, altered the expression of self-renewal genes, and compromised hematopoietic reconstitution after <b>myelotoxic</b> stress, which was reversible. In mice, tamoxifen treatment blocked development of JAK 2 V 617 F-induced myeloproliferative neoplasm in vivo, induced apoptosis of human JAK 2 V 617 F+ HSPCs in a xenograft model, and sensitized MLL-AF 9 + leukemias to chemotherapy. Apoptosis was selectively observed in mutant cells, and tamoxifen treatment only had a minor impact on steady-state hematopoiesis in disease-free animals. Together, these results uncover specific regulation of hematopoietic progenitors by estrogens and potential antileukemic properties of SERMs...|$|E
40|$|SummaryHematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSCs) are {{maintained}} in an undifferentiated quiescent state within {{a bone marrow}} niche. Here we show that Foxo 3 a, a forkhead transcription factor that acts downstream of the PTEN/PI 3 K/Akt pathway, is critical for HSC self-renewal. We generated gene-targeted Foxo 3 a−/− mice and showed that, although the proliferation and differentiation of Foxo 3 a−/− hematopoietic progenitors were normal, the number of colony-forming cells present in long-term cocultures of Foxo 3 a−/− bone marrow cells and stromal cells was reduced. The ability of Foxo 3 a−/− HSCs to support long-term reconstitution of hematopoiesis in a competitive transplantation assay was also impaired. Foxo 3 a−/− HSCs also showed increased phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK, an elevation of ROS, defective maintenance of quiescence, and heightened sensitivity to cell-cycle-specific <b>myelotoxic</b> injury. Finally, HSC frequencies were significantly decreased in aged Foxo 3 a−/− mice compared to the littermate controls. Our results demonstrate that Foxo 3 a plays {{a pivotal role in}} maintaining the HSC pool...|$|E
