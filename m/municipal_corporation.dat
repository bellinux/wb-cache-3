40|$|Positive  {{accounting}}  theory  (PAT)   tries  to  explain  corporations’  choices  {{of accounting}} standards. Empirical {{research in this}} field has been focused on the choices  made by large, listed corporations. We challenge this grounding through extending the empirical domain by testing PAT on Swedish <b>municipal</b> <b>corporations.</b> In  {{order to be able to}} explain the choice of accounting standards in <b>municipal</b> <b>corporations,</b> PAT has to be complemented by institutional factors that can consider the   forces  of  coercive,  mimetic  and  normative  pressures  presented  by  the environment. The sample of <b>municipal</b> <b>corporations</b> showed that the choice of standards was significantly explained by both PAT factors and institutional factors. The  conclusion is that <b>municipal</b> <b>corporations</b> tend to be subject to institutional influence  by  accepting the practice of their auditing firm and by using specific standards order  to legitimise themselves when they have reached a certain size. Additionally,  they  tend  to  act  according  to  PAT  predictions  by  using  those standards that are able to reduce the profit to levels that society deems acceptable for <b>municipal</b> <b>corporations.</b> Accordingly, through extending the empirical domain to <b>municipal</b> <b>corporations,</b> this paper’s contribution is to show that PAT needs the complementary institutional factors in order to be capable of explaining choice of accounting standards in firms...|$|R
