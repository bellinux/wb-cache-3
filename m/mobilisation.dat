5|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, both {{mountain}} detachments had completed <b>mobilisation</b> and concentration, and were in position. Detachment Lika was at its <b>mobilisation</b> centre, but the turn-out of men for its infantry component was low. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was completing its concentration. A large proportion of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski was moving from its <b>mobilisation</b> centres to its concentration areas. Across the 7th Army, around 80 percent of troops had answered the <b>mobilisation</b> order, but only 45 to 50 percent of vehicles and animals were available.|$|E
5|$|A general <b>mobilisation</b> was {{not called}} until 3 April 1941, {{out of fear}} of {{offending}} Adolf Hitler. By the time the invasion commenced, the 1st Cavalry Division had only begun <b>mobilisation.</b> According to the Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić, on 6 April the <b>mobilisation</b> of the division was proceeding slowly due to the low number of conscripts that reported for duty, and the poor provision of animals and vehicles. A large portion of the strength of the division had been earmarked to be detached to one of the formations of the 4th Army, Detachment Ormozki.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{planned a}} {{two-stage}} <b>mobilisation</b> of troops. The {{first wave of}} call-ups was performed in July, and was meant to intimidate Croatia without an actual offensive being launched and allow timely deployment of crucial units. After {{the first stage of}} the <b>mobilisation</b> failed to deter Croatian forces, the second stage commenced on 15 September; it was met with a large-scale refusal of mobilised personnel to report to their designated units, desertions and an overall lack of enthusiasm for the campaign. This resulted in low troop availability, forcing the JNA to deploy fewer infantry units and to abandon some operations. Response to the <b>mobilisation</b> was particularly poor in Central Serbia, where only 26% of those called-up reported for service. Nonetheless, in September 1991, the JNA discharged conscripts that had completed their terms of service, and reached 73% of planned troop levels. The <b>mobilisation</b> problems demoralised JNA troops and commanders. A request made by JNA general command to Milošević for general <b>mobilisation</b> to strengthen troop levels was denied because he did not believe the campaign was needed nor feasible. Despite the <b>mobilisation</b> problems, the JNA and the TO forces deployed in support of the campaign consisted of approximately 145,000 troops, 1,100 tanks, 700 other armoured vehicles and 1,980 artillery pieces, supported by the Yugoslav Air Force and the Navy.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} grassroots <b>mobilisations</b> in France and England {{in support}} {{of children and families}} with no right to remain on the territory. It aims to provide {{a better understanding of the}} influence of 'childhood' as a social concept and 'the child' as a social actor on social <b>mobilisations</b> {{in support of}} 'non-status' children. It also intends to analyse the impact of national contexts on <b>mobilisations.</b> The study is comparative in scope and relies on the analysis of 1, 272 claims made in newspapers and 65 interviews with grassroots campaigners. The thesis first maps the field of contention as it applies to 'non-status' children. It then goes on to investigate actors' pathways into campaigning and their reasons for getting involved and sustaining involvement. It finally considers actors' conscious work to attract and mobilise bystanders. This thesis shows that the presence of children considerably affected campaigning activities. First, children played an important role as key recruiting agents and influential collective actors. Second, childhood as a concept constituted a powerful mobilising factor, and campaigners strategically used the image of the child as innocent and vulnerable when making claims. Overall, <b>mobilisations</b> in support of 'non-status' children and families in France and England presented many similarities, including their strong emotional component and the central role of schools. However, national contexts also played a role in enabling or constraining <b>mobilisations.</b> I identify both structural and discursive differences between the French and English contexts which considerably affected campaigns. In particular, structural differences in the implementation of migration policies had a noticeable effect on campaigners' perceived ability to exert change. Furthermore, <b>mobilisations</b> in France grew into a national network able and willing to make political claims. By contrast, <b>mobilisations</b> in England remained isolated and rarely adopted a political stance, focusing instead on the individual child or family.

5|$|The 43rd Infantry Regiment {{was ordered}} to march east to join the 17th Infantry Division Vrbaska, {{which was part of}} the 2nd Army Group's 2nd Army. The 89th Infantry Regiment, {{originally}} allocated to the 17th Infantry Division Vrbaska, {{was ordered to}} march from its <b>mobilisation</b> location in Sisak and join the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska to replace the 43rd Infantry Regiment. The divisional cavalry battalion did not receive sufficient horses, and had to deploy on foot as infantry. The division was without artillery support throughout the fighting because the 40th Artillery Regiment did not complete <b>mobilisation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} <b>mobilisation</b> {{and concentration}} of the 4th Army was hampered by escalating fifth column activities and propaganda fomented by the Ustaše. Some units stopped mobilising, or began returning to their <b>mobilisation</b> centres from their concentration areas. The Yugoslav radio network linking the division with the 4th Army and flanking divisions was sabotaged by the Ustaše on 6 April, and radio communications within the 4th Army remained poor throughout the fighting.|$|E

Zagreb, Karlovac, Trebnje and Velike Lašče were key centres for the <b>mobilisation</b> and concentration of the 7th Army due to their good rail infrastructure.|$|E
40|$|Irregular {{migration}} {{is an important}} issue in contemporary societies. This article explores the changing position of irregular migrants from two angles. First, we analyse the impact of irregular migration on conceptions of rights and citizenship. This is of particular interest at a time when even the rights of ‘regular’ migrants are subject to much debate and analysis. Second, we analyse the role of <b>mobilisations</b> by irregular migrants and their supporters. We discuss scholarly debates about how to understand such <b>mobilisations,</b> as well as drawing on specific examples from France and the UK. We argue that the analysis of the claims that underpin irregular migrants' <b>mobilisations</b> should offer more space to their voices instead of those of their supporters. In so doing, we stress the importance of their everyday struggle for existence rather than for citizenship and human rights...|$|R
50|$|For this reason, postmodern {{interpretations of}} agrarian <b>mobilisations</b> in Latin America and India {{nowadays}} insist {{that these are}} ‘new’ social movements, the defining characteristic {{of which is the}} non-class identity (religion, ethnicity, gender, regionalism, nationalism) deployed by their participants. Consequently, postmodernists claim, such <b>mobilisations</b> are antagonistic to socialism, unconnected with fundamental changes in production relations, and thus incompatible with revolutionary transformation. What is at stake, Brass argues, is not just the form to be taken by economic growth in rural areas of the so-called Third World, but the very fact of development itself.|$|R

5|$|Yugoslav war plans saw the 4th Army {{organised}} and mobilised on {{a geographic}} basis from the peacetime 4th Army District, which {{was divided into}} three divisional districts, each of which was subdivided into regimental regions. Zagreb, Dugo Selo and Sisak were key centres for the <b>mobilisation</b> and concentration of the 4th Army due to their good rail infrastructure. Prior {{to the issue of}} <b>mobilisation</b> orders for the 4th Army, the 4th Army District headquarters had been involved in planning border defences and conducting exercises for border troops, including demolition plans for bridges and other infrastructure in the event of war.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, many units of the 4th Army were still at their <b>mobilisation</b> centres or in their {{concentration}} areas, and {{only a small number of}} units had actually deployed into their planned positions to defend the border. A significant number of conscripts did not report to their <b>mobilisation</b> centres. The logistics of the 4th Army were in a poor state, mainly due to a lack of livestock and vehicles for transport, but also due to fifth column sabotage by the Ustaše and their sympathisers, to the extent that many units did not even have 10 per cent of their transport needs. It was also equipped poorly, lacking in many tools of modern warfare, including tanks, light artillery, anti-aircraft weapons and air support. These deficiencies affected both its fighting power and morale.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{concerns}} over a possible Axis invasion, {{orders for the}} general <b>mobilisation</b> of the Royal Yugoslav Army were not issued by the government until 3 April 1941, {{out of fear that}} this would offend Adolf Hitler and precipitate war. When the invasion commenced on 6 April, the 4th Army was only partially mobilised, and this weakness was exacerbated by fifth column activities within its major units and higher headquarters. Revolts of Croat soldiers broke out in all three divisions in the first few days, causing significant disruption to <b>mobilisation</b> and deployment. The town of Bjelovar was taken over by rebel troops. Widespread desertions of Croat troops, many of whom turned on their Serb comrades, made control even more difficult. German activity in the 4th Army sector in the first four days included limited objective attacks to seize crossings over the Mura and Drava rivers, along with air attacks by the Luftwaffe.|$|E

40|$|Background Lateral epicondylalgia is a {{challenging}} condition to treat {{and in its}} chronic form is characterised by pain system changes. Cervical and Elbow <b>mobilisations</b> have been employed as interventions {{in the treatment of}} lateral epicondylalgia. Despite theories regarding the effects of <b>mobilisations</b> on the neurophysiology of pain, {{there is a lack of}} synthesised evidence and the hypotheses underlying mechanisms of action still need to be substantiated. Objectives The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of cervical and elbow <b>mobilisations</b> on neurophysiology of pain in patients with lateral epicondylalgia and determine the level of evidence which exists. Methods Literature searching was conducted utilising electronic databases and entering defined keywords. Studies selected were required to fulfil pre-determined and specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. This process generated studies which were concerned with assessing the effects of either cervical or elbow joint <b>mobilisations</b> on neurophysiological outcome measures in patients with chronic lateral epicondylalgia. The reference lists of the selected studies were then checked to find other suitable papers. Data Extraction of relevant information from the studies was carried out. The selected studies underwent methodological quality assessment via the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale and the Effective Public Health Practice Project assessment tool. Results Six studies were included within this review. The total number of participants included across all studies was 129. Five of the studies were randomised, repeated-measures crossover trials and one study was a repeated-measures, before-and-after design. The resuts from all studies showed statistically significant sympathoexcitation occurred concurrent with analgesia and improvements in pressure pain threshold. Conclusions The results from all studies provide evidence to support the theory that joint <b>mobilisations</b> evoke analgesia via activation of descending pathways of nociceptive control. There is a need for additional high-quality research to further explore the neurophysiological effects, including further research into other theories of action...|$|R

5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 6 April, German aircraft caught the air reconnaissance assets of the 4th Army {{on the ground at}} Velika Gorica, destroying most of them. The continuing <b>mobilisation</b> and concentration of the 4th Army was hampered by escalating fifth column activities and propaganda fomented by the Ustaše. Some units stopped mobilising, or began returning to their <b>mobilisation</b> centres from their concentration areas. During the day, Yugoslav sabotage units attempted to destroy bridges over the Mura at Letenye, Mursko Središće and Kotoriba, and over the Drava at Gyékényes. These attempts were only partially successful, due to the influence of Ustaše propaganda and the countermanding of demolition orders by the {{chief of staff of the}} 27th Infantry Division Savska. The Yugoslav radio network in the 4th Army area was sabotaged by the Ustaše on 6 April, and radio communications within the 4th Army remained poor throughout the fighting.|$|E
30|$|What Oosterlynck (2018) {{suggests}} that I should strengthen {{is precisely the}} need to widen the original notion of contact, and I would certainly place interdependency within this scope. Oosterlynck speaks about interdependency and struggle as source of solidarity, and we can even say that both are also drivers of interculturalism. More than struggle, I would say <b>mobilisations</b> for common interests. Of course, solidarity may arise in demonstration for legal rights, political rights, and for housing claims. It is here, where I would say that IC presents its most demanding face, since through <b>mobilisations</b> people interact and {{develop a sense of}} solidarity.|$|R
40|$|I {{argue that}} self-organisation cannot account for how grass roots struggles can pursue {{transnational}} political change.

They organise resistance through horizontal communication and through transnational networks involving representative structures.
