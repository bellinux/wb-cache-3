40|$|Lack of {{understanding}} <b>of</b> brain <b>death</b> {{has contributed to}} recent controversial cases (Copnell, 2014). The cases of Jahi McMath and Marlise Munoz were the focus of national news, causing an intense debate among the public and healthcare professionals (Copnell, 2014). The concept <b>of</b> brain <b>death</b> is a mystery to the public (Powell, 2014). Copnell (2014) found that 60 % of family members who had been told their loved one was brain dead {{believed that they were}} still alive. Health professionals not having a clear grasp <b>of</b> brain <b>death’s</b> <b>definition</b> and assessment can lead to increased confusion in family members (Powell, 2014) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis paper {{identified}} {{ethical issues}} relating to brain death and analyzed them according to {{the purposes of the}} Law, maqasid al shari’at, and principles of the law, qawa’id al fiqh, to reach conclusions of practical importance. MethodsIssues arising in brain death were selected from articles retrieved from PUBMED over a 10 -year period. Practical and conceptual issues identified in the articles were analyzed using maqasid al shari’atand qawa’id al fiqh. ResultsEarly determination <b>of</b> <b>death</b> by use <b>of</b> brain <b>death</b> criteria was motivated by the need to harvest transplantation organs earlier, to save intensive care resources by earlier cessation of life support, and to obtain tissues for research before deterioration. These motives would violate the principle of intention which requires that actions be judged by underlying intentions and that the end does not justify the means. In this case the nobility of the ends and their public interest were overriding considerations. The requirements, by the principle of certainty, of evidence-based proof <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were partially fulfilled by brain death criteria, tests, and examinations. The principle of custom was partially fulfilled because there was no universal consensus on criteria of brain death; the criteria varied by country, by institution, and over time. Conclusions and recommendationsBrain stem death, determined by clinical examination with or without instrumental confirmation, should remain the mainstay <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>definition.</b> Legal rulings on brain death should be reviewed every 3 years to take into consideration new developments in medical knowledge and technology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In resource-limited settings, early {{mortality}} on antire-troviral therapy (ART) {{is approximately}} 10 %; yet, {{it is unclear}} how much of that mortality occurs in care or after lost to follow-up. We assessed mortality rates and predictors <b>of</b> <b>death</b> among 12, 222 nonpregnant ART-naive adults initiating first-line ART between April 2004 and May 2012 in South Africa, stratified by person-years in care and lost. We found 14. 6 % of patients died and being lost accounted for a minority <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> across multiple <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> loss (population attributable-risk percent ranged from 10. 4 % to 42. 5 %). Although mortality rates in patients lost were much higher than in care, most ART-related mortality occurred on treatment.

40|$|Através dos tempos os conceitos da morte e os critérios para a determinar evoluíram, sobretudo a partir da segunda metade do século XX. No início, era observando se um individuo respirava ou não que se determinava se estava vivo ou morto. Depois, com o aparecimento do estetoscópio, a existência ou não de batimentos cardíacos passou a ser determinante. Com a invenção da reanimação cárdio-pulmonar e da ventilação mecânica e o início da transplantação de órgãos, a morte passou a ser determinada pela perda das funções cerebrais totais ou do tronco cerebral. Alguns filósofos e eticistas consideram ainda que deve ser pela perda irreversível das funções cerebrais superiores, as que fazem de nós pessoas, que se determina a morte. ABSTRACT The concept <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> have evolved, {{particularly}} {{in the second half}} of the XXth century. Initially observation of breathing determined the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> but with the development of the stethoscope the emphasis changed to the existence or absence of a heartbeat. Following the invention of cardiopulmonary reanimation and mechanical ventilation, coupled with the start of organ transplant techniques, death is currently determined by loss of function of the whole brain or of the brain stem. Some philosophers and ethicists consider that irreversible loss of the higher mental functions, which make people what they are, is the absolute determinant <b>of</b> <b>death...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Global {{deaths from}} measles have {{decreased}} notably in past decades, due to both increases in immunization rates and decreases in measles case fatality ratios (CFRs). While {{some aspects of}} the reduction in measles mortality can be monitored through increases in immunization coverage, estimating the level <b>of</b> measles <b>deaths</b> (in absolute terms) is problematic, particularly since incidence-based methods of estimation rely on accurate measures of measles CFRs. These ratios vary widely by geographic and epidemiologic context and even within the same community from year-to-year. METHODS: To understand better the variations in CFRs, we reviewed community-based studies published between 1980 and 2008 reporting age-specific measles CFRs. RESULTS: The results of the search consistently document that measles CFRs are highest in unvaccinated children under age 5 years; in outbreaks; the lowest CFRs occur in vaccinated children regardless of setting. The broad range <b>of</b> case and <b>death</b> <b>definitions,</b> study populations and geography highlight the complexities in extrapolating results for global public health planning. CONCLUSIONS: Values for measles CFRs remain imprecise, resulting in continued uncertainty about the actual toll measles exacts...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} literature on predictors of complicated grief (CG) was undertaken with the aim of clarifying the current knowledge and to inform future planning and work in CG following bereavement. Predictors of CG prior to the death include previous loss, exposure to trauma, a previous psychiatric history, attachment style, and the relationship to the deceased. Factors associated with the death include violent <b>death,</b> the quality <b>of</b> the caregiving or dying experience, close kinship relationship to the deceased, marital closeness and dependency, and lack of preparation for the death. Perceived social support played a key role after death, along with cognitive appraisals and high distress at the time <b>of</b> the <b>death.</b> Inconsistent <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> CG and measurement tools were noted in the earlier studies reviewed. Limitations identified in the studies included use of cross-sectional designs, heterogeneous samples, high attrition, demographic differences between cases and controls, differences in length <b>of</b> time since <b>death,</b> and differences in types <b>of</b> <b>death</b> experienced. Notwithstanding these limitations, some consistent findings have emerged. Further research into conceptualizations of CG in terms of attachment theory and constructivist and cognitive-behavioral concepts of finding purpose and meaning after bereavement is warranted...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} literature about ‘brain death’ is largely characterized by biomedical, bioethical and legal writing. This {{has led to}} overlooking wider but no less pertinent social, historical and cultural understandings about death. By ignoring the work of other social and clinical colleagues {{in the study of}} dying, the literature on the determination <b>of</b> <b>death</b> has become unnecessarily abstract and socially disconnected from parallel concerns about death and dying. This has led, and continues to lead to, incomplete suggestions and narrow discussions about the nature <b>of</b> <b>death</b> as well as an ongoing <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>of</b> general public and health care staff responses to brain death criteria. This paper provides a sociological outline of these problems through a review of the key literature on the determination <b>of</b> <b>death...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} the {{awareness}} and attitudes of health care professionals towards organ donation. 691 medical students participated in the study. There were 595 undergraduates, 65 interns and 31 postgraduate stu-dents. The general consensus was {{that there is a}} need for or-gan donation. 75 % of the participants were able to un-derstand the concept <b>of</b> brain <b>death.</b> The <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> brain <b>death</b> was not known to 20 %. None of the participants had complete knowledge as to who should authorize brain death as stated in the "Transplantation of Human Organs Bill". 20 % emphasized the need for the presence of a neu-rologist/neurosurgeon, along with other qualified person-nel, in a team to certify brain death. It was noticed that participants committed to organ donation encouraged their friends and relatives to donate their organs. They agreed that organ donation should be included in the medi-cal curriculum. The study reveals that there is a poor understanding of the concept <b>of</b> brain <b>death</b> and organ donation even among medical students. It was also observed that they were in-terested in knowing more about the subject of organ do-nation...|$|R
40|$|Most {{children}} with asthma have their disease easily controlled if low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are regularly and correctly administered. If a child presents with asthma which is apparently resistant to therapy with high-dose ICS and other controllers, {{then they have}} problematic severe asthma. However, {{in light of the}} UK National Review <b>of</b> Asthma <b>Deaths,</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> severe asthma based solely on the levels of prescribed treatment are too narrow. A detailed assessment of all such children should be performed. First, the diagnosis of asthma should be confirmed, then co-morbidities assessed. Next, a nurse-led assessment further characterizes the problem, conventionally categorizing the child as either having difficult asthma or severe therapy-resistant asthma. Here, we reassess in particular the interactions between, and management of, these two categories, highlighting that this dichotomous classification may need reconsideration. We use bronchoscopy and an intramuscular steroid injection to determine if the child has steroid-resistant asthma, using a novel, multidomain approach because the adult definition does not apply to around half the children we see. Finally, we highlight some mechanistic data which have emerged from this protocol such as the absence of T-helper 2 (TH 2) cytokines even in eosinophilic severe asthma and the potential role of the innate epithelial cytokine IL- 33, novel data on lineage negative innate lymphoid cells, which we can measure in induced sputum, and demonstrating that intraepithelial neutrophils are associated with better, not worse asthma outcomes. Severe paediatric asthma is very different from severe asthma in adults, and approaches must not be uncritically extrapolated from adult disease to children...|$|R
40|$|Recent and {{proposed}} legislation to establish “brain-related ” criteria <b>of</b> <b>death</b> has uniformly confounded irreversible cessation of total brain function with the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> the human person. Much {{of the confusion}} comes from widespread <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>of</b> how the word “death ” is used and what it means. Cessation of total brain function, whether irreversible or not, is not necessarily linked to total destruction of the brain or to the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> the person. Further, to take vital organs or to otherwise treat people {{as though they were}} dead already {{on the basis of these}} recent criteria is morally unacceptable to most Orthodox Jews and Christians...|$|R
