5000|$|It was in Texas that <b>Ms.</b> <b>Stone</b> {{began writing}} in earnest. Although she dabbled in prose, her passion was poetry. Her early {{publications}} were in local newspapers and small periodicals. Later, her works appeared in poetry magazines and poetry society journals, {{some of them}} receiving honors and small awards. On her mother's 75th birthday, <b>Ms.</b> <b>Stone</b> published a poem for her in her local paper. The poem got {{picked up by the}} local's parent company, and was printed in dozens of newspapers. [...] "Mother at 75" [...] (© 1990) [...] became Ms. Stone's most recognized poem to date.|$|E

5000|$|Wielder of Words: A Collection of Poems soon followed. According to the author's acknowledgments, {{the title}} was based upon a poem written as a {{birthday}} card for <b>Ms.</b> <b>Stone</b> by her younger son, who edited the book. Included in the collection were poems such as [...] "Another Autumn" [...] (© 1990) and [...] "Remembering" [...] (© 1989), and of course [...] "Mother at 75." [...] <b>Ms.</b> <b>Stone</b> accepted no profits from the book, and donated copies to various schools, libraries, literacy programs, and poetry societies.

50|$|Her second {{marriage}} was to L. E. Stone, a former pilot {{with an interest}} in real estate. Donna J. Stone maintained her charitable activities, expanding her endeavors to include the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse. The Stones also had one son and, due to Mr. Stone's business interests, the family eventually moved from New York to a suburb of Dallas. The Association for Retarded Children also moved their headquarters from New York to suburban Dallas, and <b>Ms.</b> <b>Stone</b> remained a strong supporter. Several years later she established the Matthew J. Pascal Foundation, a private family foundation named after her older son.|$|E
5000|$|The New York Times writer Janet Maslin {{reviewed}} the film on May 3, 1996, stating [...] "It isn't {{easy to make}} grand entrances into and exits from a tiny jail house visiting room, but Sharon Stone finds a way. In Bruce Beresford's [...] "Last Dance," [...] she brings impossible sparkle to what is (literally) a dead-end role and proves yet again that in an otherwise floundering film, she can be a lifesaver. Fully transformed from Hollywood cupcake to tough cookie, <b>Ms.</b> <b>Stone</b> has more than proven how persuasively she can act, especially in such bitterly hard-edged roles. But the Death Row drama [...] "Last Dance" [...] proves a futile exercise {{in more ways than}} one. Here, as in the recent [...] "Diabolique," [...] Ms. Stone's stellar presence and surprisingly intense performance are all that stand between the audience and the void. It's rare to find films so dependent on a star turn, or at least to find the star so markedly out of sync with her material. In [...] "Last Dance," [...] the viewer must wait patiently through rote exposition scenes until she first appears; when they finally come, her initial moments are raw and transfixing. But soon the story begins taking sentimental turns, and even Ms. Stone's startling ferocity gets buried in sludge." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} case of Stone v FCT, the Australian Federal Court had {{difficulty}} {{in determining whether}} grant payments made to an elite athlete should be characterised as income. Both levels of the Court determined {{the character of the}} payment based on a whether or not <b>Ms</b> <b>Stone</b> was carrying on a business or merely pursuing a hobby. This article argues that the distinction between a business and hobby should not blur the interpretation of what constitutes income according to ordinary concepts. The suggested threshold of when voluntary payments received by an athlete will attain the character of income should be when the individual commences commercially exploiting their personal attributes for money...|$|E

40|$|This inquiry {{sought to}} address a lack of data on the {{prevalence}} of speech, language and communication disorders in Australia. Overview The capacity to communicate verbally is fundamental to a person 2 ̆ 7 s development and wellbeing. The ability to learn effectively, to form meaningful and supportive relationships, to influence others, and to obtain and maintain employment can be significantly affected {{if a person is}} unable to verbally communicate. Undiagnosed or untreated, a person who suffers from a speech or swallowing disorder is susceptible to poorer educational outcomes, reduced employment prospects and increased likelihood of social, emotional and mental health issues. The personal cost to the individual, and to society at large, can be significant. The establishment of this inquiry On 9 December 2013, the Senate referred to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee (committee) an inquiry into the prevalence of different types of speech, language and communication disorders. A parliamentary inquiry along these lines had been advocated by the national peak body, Speech Pathology Australia (SPA), for some time. In June 2011, SPA National President, Ms Christine Stone, wrote to the committee noting that without Australian data on the prevalence of speech, language and communication disorders, 2 ̆ 7 it is impossible for government and health professionals to adequately plan and provide comprehensive prevention, promotion and therapeutic services to those individuals with communication and swallowing impairments 2 ̆ 7. <b>Ms</b> <b>Stone</b> suggested that a parliamentary committee would be the right forum to advance these inquiries, and offered SPA 2 ̆ 7 s help in refining the scope and terms of reference for the inquiry. Terms of reference: 	the prevalence of different types of speech, language and communication disorders and swallowing difficulties in Australia; 	the incidence of these disorders by demographic group (paediatric, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people with disabilities and people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities); 	the availability and adequacy of speech pathology services provided by the Commonwealth, state and local governments across health, aged care, education, disability and correctional services; 	the provision and adequacy of private speech pathology services in Australia; 	evidence of the social and economic cost of failing to treat communication and swallowing disorders; and 	the projected demand for speech pathology services in Australia...|$|E
