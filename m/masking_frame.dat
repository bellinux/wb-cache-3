Hence {{it is very important to}} design products with a high level of comfort and fit in order for the product to perform its function. With the advancement of 3 D scanning facilities, it is possible to acquire highly accurate and precise surface contour which can be used for designing customized products. With the availability of wide range of 3 D scanners, it is necessary to evaluate the user experience of products developed from different scanners based on their accuracy and precision in scanning. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of accuracy of three 3 D scanners in product designing and evaluating user’s comfort and fit parameters for the developed products. Participants were scanned using three different 3 D scanners (Artec Eva 3 D scanner, Cyberware 3030 color scanner and Structure sensor scanner). A <b>mask</b> <b>frame</b> was developed from every scan and then 3 D printed for evaluation. The individuals were made to evaluate the designed <b>mask</b> <b>frame</b> to understand their comfort and fit experience. Based on the responses from the participants it was found that the <b>mask</b> <b>frame</b> developed from the scan acquired from Artec Eva 3 D scanner was found to be the most comfortable one and had the best fit. The scans acquired from Cyberware 3030 color scanner had missing data and was reported slightly dissatisfaction on fit. The scans from the Structure sensor lacked precision and fine details, and the frame got the lowest rating at comfort level.

40|$|AbstractSubtraction {{methods in}} Angiography are {{generally}} applied {{in order to}} enhance the visualization of blood vessels by eliminating the surrounding tissues.

50|$|The most {{prevalent}} method for masks intended for surface supply applications {{is known as}} a bailout valve. The surface supplied diver generally carries a bailout gas supply sufficient to reach a place of safety based on the planned dive profile. This gas supply is regulated by a scuba first stage regulator, and plumbed into the primary air supply circuit via a bailout valve before it reaches the demand valve. The full face masks designed for surface supply work usually mount this valve {{on the side of the}} <b>mask</b> <b>frame,</b> in the bailout block, where it is convenient and easily reached by the diver. The bailout cylinder valve is normally open during the dive. To switch to bailout, the diver simply opens the bailout valve, and is immediately supplied by gas from the bailout cylinder.|$|R

Additionally, NASA’s inductorless electronic circuit technology led to lower-cost, more rugged, short-range two-way radio now used by firefighters. NASA also helped develop a specialized mask weighing less than 3 oz to protect the physically impaired from injuries to the face and head, as well as flexible, heat-resistant materials—developed to protect the space shuttle on reentry—which are being used both by the military and commercially in suits for municipal and aircraft-rescue firefighters.|$|R
30|$|Finally, it {{is worth}} {{returning}} to the somewhat artificial nature of this task. The experiment was specifically contrived to encourage detection of hyper-realistic masks. For example, we focused on masks in the task instructions and spelled out the distribution of mask and face stimuli. In view of this strong framing, the detection rate for these masks seems rather low. Nevertheless, it almost certainly overestimates the rate of spontaneous detection when a <b>mask</b> <b>framing</b> is absent. Sanders et al. (2017) reported extremely low rates of spontaneous detection, both for photographic presentations in the lab and live viewing of mask wearers outdoors. On the other hand, none of these studies has measured detection during active social interaction with the mask wearer (e.g. conversation).

40|$|Video {{inpainting}} is {{a process}} of repairing the damaged areas of a video or removing any desired part of a video. Dealing with such problems requires a sturdy image inpainting algorithm along with a regeneration technique for filling the missing parts of a video sequence recorded from a static camera. Many automatic techniques for video inpainting are available but most of them are computationally intensive and fail to repair the damaged areas. Also, from the remaining video inpainting algorithms a masked video sequence has to be provided. To overcome this problem, inpainting process is carried out by using the background registration method which is proposed in this paper. The video is first converted into distinct image frames and the first frame is registered. Second, the edges of an object to be removed are detected by comparing the registered frame with each succeeding frame of the video. Next, a <b>masked</b> <b>frame</b> is generated for each time frame. Then the inpainting process is performed separately for each and every time frame of the images.

Second, the resulted DSA image is further enhanced by background diffusion and nonlinear normalization for better visualization.

Also, for speeding up the 2 D image registration, the hierarchical motion compensation algorithm is implemented by a multi-resolution framework. The proposed method has been evaluated on a database of 73 subjects by quantitatively measuring signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio.

25|$|Divers may {{test whether}} a mask {{is a good}} fit by placing it on their face, without using the straps, and gently inhaling through their nose. If the mask stays on without any help this {{indicates}} that no air is being drawn in and that the skirt is in sufficient contact with the facial skin all the way round the mask. Optimum sealing requires that hair strands do not cross under {{the edge of the}} seal, as they can provide a path for water to leak into the mask. This is more a problem with the forehead hairline than with lower facial hair, as water from the top tends to run into the eyes, while water pooling at the bottom is easily purged by exhaling a small volume of air through the nose. Most bearded divers learn to manage the slight leakage without difficulty, inconvenience, or greasing the moustache. Other factors affecting a comfortable fit are sufficient space for the nose in the nose pocket, no contact between the rigid <b>mask</b> <b>frame</b> and the bridge of the nose, and no excessive pressure on the forehead. There should also be sufficient space between the mask lenses and the face that the eyelashes do not contact the glass noticeably when blinking.|$|R

40|$|Today, {{integrated}} circuits are fabricated {{with more and}} more devices existent on a unit area. Consequently, the inspection of such a complicated circuit poses a critical problem. A detailed visual inspection is the most effective method to screen out unreliable IC 2 ̆ 7 s. ^ But such a labor-intensive task is not suitable to be done by human operators. Also, the alignment and wire-bonding of integrated circuit are not yet fully automated. Consequently, the visual inspection process and the wire-bonding process constitute the bottle-neck of IC production. To automate these processes by means of pattern recognition and image processing techniques is a challenge. ^ A formulation of an automatic visual inspection and final packaging system is presented in this thesis. Such a system is composed of three subsystems: (1) the image segmentation and registration subsystem, (2) the visual inspection subsystem, and (3) the final packaging subsystem. The information within the visual inspection subsystem flows among three parts: (1) the visual inspection controller, (2) the design and inspection specification data base, and (3) the library of algorithms. The inspection controller decomposes the inspection job into smaller tasks. For each task, the controller activates a program fetched from the program library to operate on the sensed data by consulting the appropriate reference data. At the end of a task, the controller makes a decision of what to do next, depending on the result of the task. At last, the controller generates a report of the inspection and stops. ^ An integrated system for automatic visual inspection and wirebonding of {{integrated circuits}} is proposed in this thesis. The structure of such an integrated system follows the above general formulation. The functions of the image segmentation and registration subsystem include image segmentation, gross registration, and the microregistration of mask subpatterns. The input image S is first decomposed into the image W of the IC chip and the background. The gross registration of the IC chip is achieved by locating the <b>mask</b> <b>frame.</b> But since an IC image is a multi-layer image, each mask subpattern has to be micro-registered independently. The functions of the visual inspection subsystem include image transformation, detection and identification of IC defects, and classification. The idea of image transformation is to emphasize relevant information and to suppress irrelevant information. Furthermore, contextual information is made use of to remove ambiguity. Each IC defect is to be detected by an individual defect detector. Finally, the IC under inspection is classified into three classes: (1) accept, (2) reject, and (3) to be reworked. The final packaging subsystem solders an acceptable IC chip to the package substrate, detects the misregistration introduced during the soldering process, and then carries out the wire-bonding. ^ Such an integrated system proposed in this thesis is proved to be successful by experimental results. ...|$|R

The motion detection step makes use of the t-distribution significance test; then, the initial motion detection <b>mask</b> of every <b>frame</b> in the video sequence can be integrated to form the movement mask. For spatial segmentation the Sobel edge detection operator is used to get the boundary of the video objects in current frame; temporal-spatial filter then integrates the temporal and spatial information, extracts the precise boundary of moving object and also reduces the residual noise. Finally, the segmentation of video objects can be optimized by filling and morphology operation...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} the final thesis project for a Master of Science in Industrial Design Engineering at Luleå University of Technology, {{conducted}} during a 20 week period between September 2015 and January 2016. The purpose of this master thesis was to evaluate and analyse a PCB conformal coating process at Saab EDS in Järfälla, Sweden. The analysis {{was done with the}} in order to find ways to reduce lead time and increase efficiency in a sustainable manner within this process. At Saab EDS in Järfälla electronic circuit boards are assembled for use in electronic warfare - and counter measure systems. Since these PCB assemblies are used in very demanding and harsh environments (i. e. on military airplanes) they must be conformal coated. Conformal coating is a process whereby a protective film is applied to the PCB assembly. This process is tedious with a lot of manual application and correction, despite the fully automated coating equipment. There is also a predicted increase in both volume and product complexity making the current process insufficient to meet those demands. Reducing lead time in the process is however not straight forward since the production displays characteristics of high-mix/low-volume production. The project was conducted using a traditional development process where there was first a thorough review of available literature on the subject of lead time reduction in high-mic/low-volume environments and on the subject of efficiency in conformal coating. The current state was then mapped and analysed using a mix of different well-known methods such as value stream mapping and hierarchical task analysis. The current state analysis resulted in a number of process requirements meant to alleviate the most critical issues. Solutions to these issues where developed using a high level of participation from the operators and company stakeholders to identify viable and reliable solutions. The final results pointed to three different areas as having the largest potential to reduce lead time and increase efficiency and capacity. These where;- A reduction of wait time and delays by introducing a plan- and control policy, a CONWIP policy was fund to be most suitable to the HMLV characteristics in the process. - Increased capacity in masking that can be achieved by upgrading the coating equipment to a higher level of precision and by developing individualized <b>masking</b> <b>frames</b> for complex boards. Additionally a proposed co-operation process between production- and construction departments will help alleviate masking issues in future products. - A reduction of cure time to normal levels, as it was prolonged due to quality errors. This can be done by investing in storage cabinets for boards in conformal coating so they are not subject to contamination and climate changes to the same extent and also by reviewing the coating application policy to possibly reduce the number of coats or the curing time between coats. Finally there must be a thorough review the cause of quality issues in curing so they can be improved in future productsThese changes could potentially lead to an average lead time reduction by up to 80 % or 17 days and an increased capacity of up to 36 % or around 340 more PCB assemblies per year. The changes will be essential to handle the increased volume and change in products that have been predicted. Validerat; 20160125 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
