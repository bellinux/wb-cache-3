For the baseline scenario it would be crucial to ensure the implementation of renewable electricity technologies, the reduction of energy consumption in vehicles (through hybrids and also through efficiency gains for all remaining fuel cars), the modal change from road to rail, and efficiency gains in climatization of buildings (efficient heaters and heat pumps). For the political scenario, given that the potential for modernization of heating technologies is already partially depleted, {{the most attractive}} energy saving measures are wind energy, vehicle improvements, or a <b>modal</b> <b>switch</b> towards rail for freight transport.

Consistently, the transport mode is threaded as a choice attribute. Differently from other studies (see for example Matear and Gray, 1993 and Lu, 2000), the modelling framework introduces attribute cut-offs (Swait, 2001), in order to account for a two-stage decision process. The dataset used for this study is the result of 30 interviews, which have been realised in the Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia. Results show that the transport mode does not represent a discriminatory choice variable, while attributes related to the quality level of the service (e. g. damages and losses) are as important as cost attributes...|$|E

Here we show that host cell transmission of the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii is closely tied to specific cell cycle distributions, with egress and reinvasion occurring most proficiently by parasites in the G 1 phase. We also reveal that Toxoplasma undergoes marked changes in mRNA expression when transitioning from the extracellular environment to its intracellular niche. These mRNA level changes reflect a <b>modal</b> <b>switch</b> from expression of proteins involved in invasion, motility and signal transduction in extracellular parasites to expression of metabolic and DNA replication proteins in intracellular parasites.

By treating transport modes independently and not taking full account of modal options available, policymakers have overlooked potentially important and low cost contributions to overall passenger safety. This thesis investigates the extent to which Cross <b>Modal</b> <b>Switching</b> (CMS), encouraging users to transfer to safer modes of transport, can be deployed as an instrument of transport safety policy. Research was conducted to establish the safety differences between modes on specific journeys, taking account of composite risks including all transport modes used. Primary research used surveys and qualitative interviews to target three different groups to understand their views on transport safety, willingness to switch modes, reasons that would cause them to <b>switch</b> and <b>modal</b> perceptions on risk and travel behaviour. The feasibility of promoting CMS was assessed by measuring substitutability between modes and calculating cross-elasticities using data from the empirical surveys conducted and previously published work. Cost benefit calculations were made using monetised risk and the cost of fares subsidies to assess the net safety benefits for three selected journeys. This analysis shows that there is a marginal justification for CMS as a tool within an overall integrated transport policy that considers safety in all modes simultaneously. This must recognise that the absolute safety benefits are not very large relative to other benefits, although the relative size depends on the manner in which changes of consumer surplus are treated in the CBA. CMS can be demonstrated to be cost effective in low risk modes, relative to larger infrastructure investments only yielding marginal safety improvements. Further research, using a larger sample of journey net benefit calculations, is thus required to validate the case robustly for CMS, identifying beneficial opportunities for <b>modal</b> <b>switching</b> on specific routes and target modes...|$|R

The clean development mechanism (CDM) provides two approved methodologies for estimating and verifying reduced greenhouse gas emissions due to <b>modal</b> <b>switch</b> induced by BRT. However, the methods do not fully account for established transport sector experience on the complexities of forecasting and measuring the direct and induced changes in travel behavior.

40|$|Given the {{alarming}} {{prevalence of obesity}} worldwide {{and the need for}} interventions to halt the growing epidemic, more evidence on the role and impact of transport interventions for obesity prevention is required. This study conducts a scoping review of the current evidence of association between modes of transport (motor vehicle, walking, cycling and public transport) and obesity-related outcomes. Eleven reviews and thirty-three primary studies exploring associations between transport behaviours and obesity were identified. Cohort simulation Markov modelling was used to estimate the effects of body mass index (BMI) change on health outcomes and health care costs of diseases causally related to obesity in the Melbourne, Australia population. Results suggest that evidence for an obesity effect of transport behaviours is inconclusive (29 % of published studies reported expected associations, 33 % mixed associations), and any potential BMI effect is likely to be relatively small. Hypothetical scenario analyses suggest that active transport interventions may contribute small but significant obesity-related health benefits across populations (approximately 65 health adjusted life years gained per year). Therefore active transport interventions that are low cost and targeted to those most amenable to <b>modal</b> <b>switch</b> are the most likely to be effective and cost-effective from an obesity prevention perspective.

40|$|This thesis was {{conceived}} {{in the context}} of post- 2000 proliferation of Australian low-cost carriers and regional dispersal policy of the Australian government. The broad aim of this thesis is {{to examine the effects of}} low-cost carriers on regional dispersal of domestic visitors. Based on existing theoretical frameworks of tourists&# 146; spatial behaviour and multi-destination travel itinerary, two theoretical constructs - intra-modal and inter-modal effects &# 150; were developed to conceptualise the regional dispersal effects of low-cost carriers. The former refers to differences between low-cost carriers and other models of airline business, and the latter refers to differences between low-cost carriers and other modes of transport. Logit models and national-level revealed preference data were used to examine the intra-modal effects, while stated choice method was used to examine the inter-modal effects on two representative regional tourism destinations - Ballina-Byron and Cairns - in Australia. This thesis provides evidence that suggest low-cost carrier air arrivals tend to disperse for reasons that are different from network carrier air arrivals, supporting the significance of intra-modal effects on regional dispersal. It is claimed that the intra-modal effect is one reason why some destinations observe high growth in airport activity as a result of low-cost carrier entry, but the levels of tourism activities do not match that extrapolated from the level of growth in the incoming air traffic. Two case studies have shown that (1) ground transport policy can completely offset the negative effects on tourists&# 146; dispersal propensity stemming from pre-determined trip characteristics, although the effectiveness of such policy variables varies significantly across destinations; and (2) significant discounts in airfares are sufficient to trigger a <b>modal</b> <b>switch,</b> even in situations when a car is the most suitable mode for the trip, suggesting a real possibility of a bypass of ground-mode-reliant regions. The findings should be of interest to regional destination managers with low-cost carrier services as much as for managers in peripheral destinations without low-cost carrier services...|$|E

40|$|Since {{they change}} the individuals' time perception, {{qualitative}} aspects of transport are increasingly discussed as factors influencing {{the choice between}} individualised and public transport. In this article we investigate, both analytically and empirically, the utility cost of congestion in public transport networks, the congestion being defined as the space available for travelers in trains. First, we propose a simple model integrating a qualitative component into the utility function of commuters. This enables us to underline {{the effect on the}} individual welfare, and modal decision, of reduced comfort in trains. For a policy aiming at reducing car usage, this "cross-modal externality" may significantly soften the overall <b>modal</b> <b>switch.</b> Therefore, it appears of major interest to appraise the utility cost of public transport congestion [...] Using contingent methodology and survey data from central Paris subway - a relevant case study due to recent evolutions in transportation patterns- we then approximate this discomfort effect. According to answers of 533 line 1 users, this is equivalent to 5. 7 - 8. 1 minutes of excess travel, i. e. 29 %- 42 % of average trip duration or 1. 01 - 1. 42 euro once translated in monetary terms. With the use of categorical estimates, we show that these figures significantly rise with trip time as well as levels of congestion, while being quite stable across individual characteristics. We conclude with policy implications by approximating the marginal benefit of subway decongestion at 0. 25 euro/passenger*kilometer. This new parameter allows us to illustrate how considering comfort in public transport changes the picture when one comes to appraise evolutions in the Parisian transportation patterns. For example, decongestion benefits in undergrounds (3. 5 M euros) due to a new tramway in South Paris overpass the time savings induced by this new infrastructure (2. 7 M euros). Over 2000 - 2007, the increase in subway congestion costs may also be estimated at 100 M euros. Therefore, these figures underline the need for an accurate understanding of the perceived costs of travels...|$|E

In response to this reality, both the EU and UK governments have developed policy advocating a transfer of freight from roads to the more environmentally friendly transport modes of water and rail. In essence this is an investigation and analysis of the economic, environmental and political issues which affect the diversion of freight from roads to water in the 21 st century. Packer's 1994 "Roads to water" study examined the prospect of the viability of a significant <b>modal</b> <b>switch</b> from roads to water and highlighted a numbe of issues which he felt would adversley affect modal transfer. This thesis tests a number of these conclusions to see if they are still a barrier to conversion in 2004 as Packer suggested they were ten years earlier. This is achieved by the analysis of six different case studies, where it is felt that the traditional road haulage element could be transferred to water transport. An analysis of the pollution and external costs imposed on society by the road halulage element within these studies has been compared to an alternative BWDF option, and the results clearly show that water, in every case is considerably more environmentally friendly than road. In addition to this, the research has established a number of other results pertaining to these studies. These include the compariosn of the operation costs of both modes, the number of LGV kilometres eradicated by the modal transfer and the reduction of fuel used. The conclusion of this analysis is that, in one year, 33, 594 long distance road haulage journeys could be eradicated from UK roads. It also concluded that the distance generated by long distance road haulage would reduce from 6, 084, 091 kms to 422, 837 kms local (short distance) haulage, a reduction of 5, 661, 254 kms. In addition, 2, 055 tonnes of fuel would be reduced to 139 tonnes saving 1, 916 tonnes per annum, and road halulage pollution would fall from 9, 051 tonnes per annum to 630 tonnes eradicating 8, 421 tonnes of land based pollution.

In patch clamp recordings of isolated nuclei from insect Sf 9 cells, InsP(3) R channels were consistently detected with regulation by cytoplasmic InsP(3) and free Ca 2 + concentrations ([Ca 2 +](i)) very similar to that observed for vertebrate InsP(3) R. Long channel activity durations of the Sf 9 -InsP(3) R have now enabled identification of a novel aspect of InsP(3) R gating: modal gating. Using a novel algorithm to analyze channel modal gating kinetics, InsP(3) R gating can be separated into three distinct modes: a low activity mode, a fast kinetic mode, and a burst mode with channel open probability (P- 0) within each mode of 0. 007 +/- 0. 002, 0. 24 +/- 0. 03, and 0. 85 +/- 0. 02, respectively. Channels reside in each mode for long periods (tens of opening and closing events), and transitions between modes can be discerned with high resolution (within two channel opening and closing events). Remarkably, regulation of channel gating by [Ca 2 +](i) and [InsP(3) ] does not substantially alter channel P- 0 within a mode.

The purpose {{of this research is}} to analyse the discourse of persuasion in Shakespeare from the perspective of historical pragmatics (Jucker & Taavitsainen 2010), with particular attention to modals employed as part of the strategies. The modals under investigation are proximal and distal central modals, SHALL/SHOULD, WILL/WOULD, CAN/COULD, MAY/MIGHT, MUST, and the contracted form ’LL. The data for the present study is drawn from The Riverside Shakespeare (Evans 1997) and the concordance by Spevack (1968 - 1980). The corpus includes both cases where the persuasion attempt is successful and unsuccessful. After defining persuasion in comparison to speech acts, quantitative analysis reveals how frequently the persuader and the persuadee employ a modal regarding each type of modality and speech act. Further analysis shows in what manner the persuader and the persuadee interact with each other in discourse resorting to the following strategies: modality, proximal and distal meanings of the modal, speech act of each utterance including a modal, and use of the same <b>modal</b> or <b>switching</b> <b>modals</b> in interaction. This research thus clarifies how effectively speakers attempted to persuade others in interactions, shedding light on communication mechanisms in the past.

40|$|The {{inositol}} 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (InsP 3) receptor (InsP 3 R) plays {{a critical}} role in generation of complex Ca 2 + signals in many cell types. In patch clamp recordings of isolated nuclei from insect Sf 9 cells, InsP 3 R channels were consistently detected with regulation by cytoplasmic InsP 3 and free Ca 2 + concentrations ([Ca 2 +] i) very similar to that observed for vertebrate InsP 3 R. Long channel activity durations of the Sf 9 -InsP 3 R have now enabled identification of a novel aspect of InsP 3 R gating: modal gating. Using a novel algorithm to analyze channel modal gating kinetics, InsP 3 R gating can be separated into three distinct modes: a low activity mode, a fast kinetic mode, and a burst mode with channel open probability (P o) within each mode of 0. 007 ± 0. 002, 0. 24 ± 0. 03, and 0. 85 ± 0. 02, respectively. Channels reside in each mode for long periods (tens of opening and closing events), and transitions between modes can be discerned with high resolution (within two channel opening and closing events). Remarkably, regulation of channel gating by [Ca 2 +] i and [InsP 3] does not substantially alter channel P o within a mode. Instead, [Ca 2 +] i and [InsP 3] affect overall channel P o primarily by changing the relative probability of the channel being in each mode, especially the high and low P o modes. This novel observation therefore reveals <b>modal</b> <b>switching</b> as the major mechanism of physiological regulation of InsP 3 R channel activity, with implications for the kinetics of Ca 2 + release events in cells. © The Rockefeller University Press. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} Text World Theory {{has emerged as}} a {{powerful}} technique for exploring the cognitive interactions of the reader with literary texts. In the essay that follows, Text World Theory is outlined and used to analyse the pattern of world switches which the reader undergoes as they move through Heaney's poem Squarings: Lightenings VIII. The essay also examines the various mechanisms by which those mental switches are instigated. Through this analysis, it is shown how Heaney's metaphorical representations are constructed and maintained by the reader, and inferences are drawn about the importance of cultural knowledge, and the pragmatic interpretation of utterances in relation to the type of deictic and <b>modal</b> world <b>switches</b> the reader experiences in the poem. The analysis also generates some difficulties for Text World Theory as it currently stands, and attempts to resolve these...|$|R
