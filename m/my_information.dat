According to <b>my</b> <b>information,</b> the question of which form of propaganda to choose is presently being discussed in the GIC ... it’s a pity that Jan Appel has stayed with the people of Communistenbond Spartacus. Already in the past, I have noted how his spirit and his conceptions are determined by his experiences in the great German movement which was the culminating point of his life. It’s there that he formed his understanding of the organisational techniques of the councils. But he was too much a man of action to be content with simple propaganda. But the wish to be a man of action in a period in which the mass movement doesn’t yet exist, easily leads to the formulation of impure and mystified forms of action. Perhaps it’s a good thing after all that Communistenbond Spartacus has held on to one strong element.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Neely {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with The A.V. Club that a major inspiration behind the premise of the series derives from his lack of college experiences: [...] "I had this very small slice of an understanding of how college life is. To me, it's high school for adults, and I guess I'm depicting it that way. My sister is a professor. ... I'm around professors, but I'm kind of misinformed a bit. <b>My</b> <b>information</b> is broken and that's what makes China wonky and interesting, because it's what's so fucking wrong about college." [...] Similarly, in the series, Neely parodies popular culture elements that he knows only through passing mentions. The season two episode, [...] "The Diamond Castle", parodies the Mad Men episode, [...] "The Other Woman", which Neely stated he had never watched before; he explained that [...] "We do that often where we'll just take my ignorance and run with it." [...] The A.V. Club interview also has Neely describe aspects of the series inspired by his Arkansan upbringing; he admits that he [...] "talk about [...] all the time, it turns out. The final episode of the season is about hog infestation. It's happening all over southern United States, where wild boars are just overpopulating—they tear up the land and land owners and cattle ranchers have to hunt these things and put Kevlar vests on their dogs because they have horns and shit." ...|$|E
