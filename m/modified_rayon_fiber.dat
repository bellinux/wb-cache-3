30|$|Barrier {{materials}} {{constructed of}} natural fibers (e.g., cotton) often produce a fire blocking char upon exposure to heat and/or flames.

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the utilization of a recycled rayon waste-kapok mixtures as an oil sorbent for the removal of diesel, motor oil and bunker C. The effects of the kapok fibers: <b>rayon</b> <b>fibers</b> ratio and the additional of sodium sulfate on RRWK sorbents properties were investigated through series of oil sorption tests. The ASTM 726 - 06 method was used to determine the oil sorption capacity of the sorbents under both static and dynamic conditions. The results showed the high sorption capacity of the recycled rayon waste-kapok mixture for difference kinds of oil. Oil, which has a high viscosity, tends to have a higher oil sorption ratio. RRWK sorbents had higher oil sorption capacity than commercial polypropylene. The presence of kapok fibers in RRWK increases the hydrophobicity and oil sorption capacity of the sorbents while the presence of <b>rayon</b> <b>fibers</b> improves the strength of the sorbents. The additional of sodium sulfate during sorbent preparation increases the surface area and pore size of RRWK sorbent and thus improves the oil sorption capacity. It can be concluded that RRWK, which can be produced by utilizing industrial waste, is effective low cost, environmentally friendly oil sorbent with comparable performance to commercial products.

The present work took for study three types of chemical <b>fibers</b> (wool-type <b>rayon,</b> wool-type polyester, wool-type polyacrylonitrile) and two types of wool fibers S 11 and S 12. The main characteristics of wool type chemical fibers (fiber count, nominal length, breaking length, relative elongation, brightness) and of wool fibers (diameter, almeter length, uster irregularit) have been measured. Then the fibers were subjected to thermal treatments in certain conditions. From the researches performed for the both wool blends, S 11 and S 21, one can notice that the torsional rigidity/stiffness increases after the thermal treatment and the wool fibers changes their handle accordingly. The <b>rayon</b> <b>fibers</b> present the biggest torsional rigidity, as compared to the other types of analyzed fibers, both untreated and heat treated.

Scanning electron micrographs supported the adherence results and revealed more cells on the surface of cotton than <b>rayon</b> <b>fibers.</b> Treatment of staphylococcal cells with proteolytic enzymes significantly reduced binding to pure cotton and detergent-treated cotton fibers. Immunoblot analysis of cell wall proteins suggested that surface proteins in the mol wt range of 120 - 220 kD were involved in the adherence of S. aureus to cotton fibers. Although the adherence of S. aureus to cotton fibers alone appeared to be mediated through surface charge or hydrophobic interactions, bacterial binding to fibers which have been pretreated with defibrinated blood appeared to be more specific and independent of the surface constituents of the fibers.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{oxidative}} {{thermal stability}} of microcrystalline plant-based viscose <b>rayon</b> cellulose <b>fiber</b> was improved {{in the presence}} of an ammonium sulfate solution. The structural characterization of the oxidized samples was carried out using a combination of fiber thickness, linear density, burning test, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric anal-ysis (TGA), and infrared (IR) spectroscopy measurements. Oxidized viscose <b>rayon</b> <b>fibers</b> showed physical and chemical transforma-tions with increasing oxidation temperature and were characterized by a reduction in fiber diameter and linear density values together with color changes with increasing oxidation temperature. The results obtained from XRD analysis showed the loss of crystallinity due to the amorphization processes.

The DSC and TGA measurements indicated that there was an improvement in thermal stability. The results obtained from IR spectra showed the progress of dehydrogenation and dehydration reactions.
