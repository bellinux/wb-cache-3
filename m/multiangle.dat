50|$|<b>Multiangle</b> light {{scattering}} (MALS) describes a technique {{for measuring the}} light scattered by a sample into a plurality of angles. It is used for determining both the absolute molar mass and the average size of molecules in solution, by detecting how they scatter light. Collimated light from a laser source is most often used, {{in which case the}} technique can be referred to as <b>multiangle</b> laser {{light scattering}} (MALLS). The insertion of the word “laser” was intended to reassure those used to making light scattering measurements with conventional light sources such as Hg-arc lamps that low angle measurements could now be made. Until the advent of lasers and their associated fine beams of narrow width, the width of conventional light beams used to make such measurements prevented data collection at smaller scattering angles. In recent years, since all commercial light scattering instrumentation use laser sources, this need to mention the light source has been dropped and the term MALS used throughout.|$|E

A <b>multiangle</b> absorption photometer takes into account both transmitted and reflected light.

40|$|Abstract: Owing to {{the complex}} {{geometry}} of helical cutting tools, several manufacturing pro-cesses are required to produce {{the profile of the}} cutter and the cutting angles. If the traditional method of manufacture were used, the cost would be frustratingly expensive. In this paper, a novel straight-sided hob cutter design consisting of two curved cutting edges and three straight cutting edges with different pressure angles is proposed. By applying designed rake profile equations of a hob cutter, the principle of coordinate transformation, the theory of differential geometry, and the theory of gearing, a mathematical model of the helical cutting tool is derived. In addition, the cutting angles, the condition of full undercutting, and the width of the top land of the cutter are also studied. The novelty of the design is such that the <b>multiangles</b> of the helical cutting tool can be manufactured in one hobbing process, thereby simplifying the man-ufacturing process. The results and concepts proposed in the paper will be beneficial as design guidance for tool designers, will enhance the manufacturing processes of helical cutting tools, and will assist tool-related industries in upgrading their technology and competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|Interest {{in using}} the {{extended}} endonasal transsphenoidal approach for management of suprasellar lesions, with either a microscopic or endoscopic technique, has increased in recent years. The most relevant benefit is that this median approach permits the exposure and removal of suprasellar lesions {{without the need for}} brain retraction. Fifteen human cadaver heads were dissected to evaluate the surgical key steps and the advantages and limitations of the extended endoscopic endonasal transplanum sphenoidale approach. We compared this with the transcranial microsurgical view of the suprasellar area as explored using the bilateral subfrontal microsurgical approach, and with the anatomy of the same region as obtained through the endoscopic endonasal route.

50|$|The {{commercialization of}} <b>multiangle</b> systems began in 1977 when Science Spectrum, Inc. {{patented}} a flow-through capillary {{system for a}} customized bioassay system developed for the USFDA. The first commercial MALS instrument incorporating 8 discrete detectors was delivered to S.C. Johnson and Son, by Wyatt Technology Company, in 1983, followed in 1984 with {{the sale of the}} first 15 detector flow instrument (Dawn-F) to AMOCO. By 1988, a three-dimensional configuration was introduced specifically to measure the scattering properties of single aerosol particles. At about the same time, the underwater device was built to measure the scattered light properties of single phytoplankton. Signals were collected by optical fibers and transmitted to individual photomultipliers. Around December 2001, an instrument was commercialized, which measures 7 scattering angles using a CCD detector (BI-MwA: Brookhaven Instruments Corp, Hotlsville, NY).|$|E
40|$|Between August 1987 and May 1989 five {{patients}} with petroclival meningiomas were operated {{on at the}} Neurosurgical Clinic of the Krankenhaus Nordstadt. Hannover, Germany, using an original combined supra- and infratentorial presigmoid sinus approach. There were two men and three women, {{ranging in age from}} 34 to 61 years (mean, 48 years; median, 46 years). Follow-up ranged between 1 and 22 months. There was no death. Postoperatively, two patients had no useful hearing, one had a permanent facial palsy (the facial nerve had to be sacrificed intraoperatively due to its involvement with tumor), one had a permanent abducens palsy (the VI nerve was involved with tumor and had to be cut). Temporary lower (IX to XII) cranial nerve palsy was observed in all the patients; temporary VI, in two patients; temporary VII, in two patients, temporary hemiparesis, in one patient, temporary gait ataxia, in three patients; and persistent gait ataxia, in one patient. All patients had total tumor removal as assessed at surgery and with postoperative enhanced computed tomography. Four patients were independent and able to carry on normal activity, and one patient was independent at home but not outside due to severe ataxia 4 months after the operation. The presigmoid sinus avenue to the petroclival region shortens the distance to the clivus, permits a <b>multiangled</b> exposure of this difficult surgical area, minimizes the amount of temporal lobe retraction, preserves the integrity of the transverse sinus, and allows for better preservation of the neurovascular structures.

40|$|The Down {{syndrome}} {{cell adhesion}} molecule 1 (Dscam 1) gene is an extraordinary example of diversity: by combining alternatively spliced exons, thousands of isoforms can be produced from just one gene. So far, such diversity in this gene has only been found in insects and crustaceans, and its essential part in neural wiring has been well-characterized for Drosophila melanogaster. Ten years ago evidence from D. melanogaster showed that the Dscam 1 gene is involved in insect immune defense and work on Anopheles gambiae indicated {{that it is a}} hypervariable immune receptor. These exciting findings showed that via processes of somatic diversification insects have the possibility to produce unexpected immune molecule diversity, and it was hypothesized that Dscam 1 could provide the mechanistic underpinnings of specific immune responses. Since these first publications the quest to understand the function of this gene has uncovered fascinating insights from insects and crustaceans. However, we are still far from a complete understanding of how Dscam 1 functions in relation to parasites and pathogens and its full relevance for the immune system. In this Hypothesis and Theory article, we first briefly introduce Dscam 1 and what we know so far about how it might function in immunity.

We find that 2 D <b>multiangle</b> transport is superior in capturing the global and local radiation-field variations associated with rotation-induced and SASI-induced aspherical hydrodynamic configurations.

40|$|<b>Multiangle,</b> {{multispectral}} {{remote sensing}} observations, {{such as those}} anticipated from the Earth Observing System (EOS) <b>multiangle</b> imaging spectroradiometer (MISR), can distinguish spherical from nonspherical particles over calm ocean for mineral-dust-like particles with the range of sizes and column amounts expected under natural conditions. The ability to make such distinctions is critical if remote sensing of atmospheric aerosol properties is to provide significant new contributions {{to our understanding of}} the global-scale, clear-sky solar radiation balance. According to theoretical simulations the measurements can retrieve column optical depth for nonspherical particles to an accuracy of at least 0. 05 or 10 %, whichever is larger. In addition, three to four distinct size groups between 0. 1 and 2. 0 microns effective radius can be identified at most latitudes...|$|E
