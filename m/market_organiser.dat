40|$|In {{a recent}} edition of The Guardian, {{there was a}} story about the {{privatisation}} of Berwick Street Market, an historic London market in the heart of Soho. Stallholders are protesting at the council’s decision to bring in a “commercial operator” to manage the market. Why would the council would do that? Not only for efficiency reasons, but as a councillor mentions, the market needs to “wash its face”. Bringing in a <b>market</b> <b>organiser</b> for Berwick Street is a way of changing {{the look and feel of}} the market and the area; as a market campaigner says in the article “the reinvention of markets has got to be done in a curated way”...|$|E

40|$|This paper explicates the {{enduring}} and permanent structures that empower <b>market</b> <b>organisers</b> {{to act as}} they shape the temporary markets of the Durga Puja festival in India. <b>Market</b> <b>organisers</b> invoke, create and assemble market devices that empower market actors to perform these temporary markets. Using a visual sociology methodology we show how organisers calculate and intervene to empower certain market actors - specifically, ‘those at the BoP’, {{as well as to}} disempower certain forms of action - the use of toxic substances in the production of the Durga icon. We show how sometimes market empowerment and disempowerment are sustained beyond the performance of the temporary market, transforming the community and environmental practices. In this way, the paper foregrounds the two-way relationship between broader social structures and the performance of temporary markets by showing how market practices sometimes spread out beyond the market and become part of the broader structures of everyday life...|$|R

This followed a dispute between the Professional Golfers Association of India and Tiger Sports <b>Marketing,</b> the <b>organisers</b> of the Indian Golf Tour.

In the event, the new tour, the Professional Golf Tour of India, took over as India's sole domestic professional tour, though Tiger Sports Marketing remained involved in other aspects of Indian golf.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Tourism)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The event tourism {{industry}} {{is one of}} the fastest growing tourism industries worldwide. One type of event that is growing immensely is festivals, especially music festivals such as the Cape Town International Jazz Festival. As a result of the fast growing pace of festivals, it has become crucial for a festival to sustain itself in the market place to stay competitive. The Cape Town International Jazz Festival (the Jazz Festival) is a fast growing music festival and hosts numerous well–known local and international jazz artists, as well as young up–and–coming artists. For this exciting Jazz Festival to keep growing, it needs to be sustainable. To achieve this, the organisers and managers of the Jazz Festival need to know what is important to the visitors of the Jazz Festival, so they can fulfil their needs. This in turn leads to satisfied visitors that will return to the Jazz Festival and keep the festival sustainable. Generally speaking, music festivals have a more professional management approach than other tourism events and thus are more likely to be more successful. Key Success Factors (KSFs) are a precondition for the success of any event and will influence the competitiveness of the event in the market place. It is imperative for organisers to identify the KSFs that are important to the visitors so as to provide them with a satisfactory experience. This will also assist in measuring the achievement of the event’s goals and objectives. The main purpose of this study was to determine the KSFs in managing the visitor experience at the Cape Town International Jazz Festival. To reach this goal, the study is divided into two articles. Research for both articles was conducted at the Cape Town International Jazz Festival through distributing 400 questionnaires randomly throughout the two days of the festival, which was held on 3 and 4 April 2010. Article 1 is titled: “Key aspects for efficient and effective management of the Cape Town International Jazz Festival: a visitor’s perspective”. The main purpose of this article was to identify the Key Success Factors in managing the Cape Town International Jazz Festival, to determine what visitors deemed as important when attending the Jazz Festival. A factor analysis was done to achieve this goal. Results indicated that Hospitality Factors, Quality Venues, Information Dissemination, Marketing and Sales, and Value and Quality are the KSFs that are of importance when managing the Jazz Festival. The results of this article provided festival managers with valuable information when organising an event such as the Cape Town International Jazz Festival. Article 2 is titled: “The importance of different Key Success Factors to different target markets of the Cape Town International Jazz Festival based on travel motives”. The main purpose of this article was to determine whether different target markets that are visiting the Jazz Festival, deemed different KSFs as important, depending on their travel motives. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was done to determine if there were statistically significant differences between the three clusters and the KSFs that they deemed important. Results showed that the three clusters, namely, Escapists, Culture Seekers and Jazz Lovers, deemed different KSFs as important when they are visiting the Jazz Festival. The results of this article gave festival <b>organisers</b> and <b>marketing</b> managers insight as to which markets to focus scarce marketing resources on and which markets to keep growing, as they will sustain the festival in the long term. Therefore, this research revealed the KSFs that are of utmost importance when managing the Cape Town International Jazz Festival, and that these aspects differ for certain <b>markets.</b> <b>Organisers</b> therefore need to assess the KSFs to provide products that will satisfy the visitor in order for him/her to return each year and keep the festival competitive and sustainable.

40|$|Even though {{women in}} Pakistan have {{attracted}} some interest among researchers and policymakers, {{they are often}} represented as oppressed and victimised members of a highly patriarchal society. What is lacking are nuanced approaches that recognise Pakistani women as active and diverse agents without neglecting the societal structures that limit their agency. This research thus aims to provide more detailed representations of Pakistani women. The study argues that a research perspective based on poststructuralist, feminist and postcolonial concepts of power, knowledge and subjects is helpful for analysing links between Pakistani women’s individual experiences and their implication in diverse social relations of power. Against this background, this study adopts just this kind of research perspective to explore how Pakistani female development practitioners working in Government of Pakistan projects in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province experience and negotiate their work environment, particularly in respect to gendered relations of power. The four research papers present insights into this research problem. Each of the four papers discusses a specific aspect: the relations between women and non domestic work as constituted through state discourses (Paper I); the complex field realities in which Pakistani development practitioners work (Paper II); the labour <b>market</b> for social <b>organisers</b> – a type of development practitioner – in northwest Pakistan and its gendered nature (Paper III); and the challenges female development practitioners face in their work environment and the coping strategies they develop (Paper IV). Each of the papers {{is based on an}} individual set of primary and/or secondary data such as job announcements, observations and people’s narratives. Primary data was generated through qualitative methodologies between 2006 and 2008 during several periods of fieldwork in Pakistan. The research identifies the development sector as a complex and often contested work environment. Many local residents perceive ‘development’ as an instrument of the ‘West’ for pursuing its interests, and they are thus generally wary of development practitioners and organisations. A rising number of verbal and physical attacks in the late 2000 s have affected the work of many development practitioners. Besides the resistance to development as a ‘Western’ ideology, there is also a widespread need for and interest in material benefits, which complicates development practitioners’ work further. When social organisers go to communities, they are supposed to select and support villages, communities and individuals that need developing. In a village, however, there are usually different voices that claim the right to development. The findings of the present study show that villagers variably draw on social categories such as development status, clan membership or gender to convince (potential) development practitioners of their eligibility for material benefits. Furthermore, an analysis of job announcement for social organisers shows that job qualifications are high (e. g. for language skills and willingness to work in a mixed-gender working environment) and the rewards (e. g. wages and social recognition) are low. For women in particular, it is difficult to present the requisite skills, since social values and norms regarding gender discriminate against women in areas such as access to information, ability to travel, and eligibility for employment in general. The study further elaborates {{on the fact that the}} development sector has become a growing work opportunity for (mainly middle class) Pakistani women. This is because of a growing demand for well-educated female employees in this sector, but also because of a growing dependency of many middle-class families on women’s income. While the female participation rate in the Pakistani labour force is generally low (21. 7...|$|R
