Jerry agrees after some reluctance, insisting that their clothes remain segregated. After retrieving the laundry the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers that he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. The owner of the laundromat (John Capodice), tells him that he did not see the money, but also points out that he is not responsible for valuables.

5|$|The {{town was}} well defended and fortified, as Navarro had {{prepared}} a {{defense in depth}} with several concentric rings of trenches, barricades and fortifications.

Ben Viljoen and the grandson of the famous Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi II (news dispatches from the battle also mention {{the participation of the}} future star of many Hollywood Westerns, Tom <b>Mix).</b> <b>In</b> order to counteract the formidable defenses, the rebels developed an effective strategy that managed to circumvent Navarro's well-placed machine-gun nests and street barricades. Rather than attacking through the streets, the rebels used the dynamite to blow the walls of the adobe houses that were huddled up next to each other, which allowed them to proceed through the city house by house.|$|E

On October 14, 2013, Square Enix announced that Re:coded {{would be part}} of the Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix collection, released exclusively on the PlayStation 3. Due to the games touch screen use on the Nintendo DS, console conversion was ruled out as it would necessitate a full remake. Two additional hours of cinematics were created for the game to cover the entire story and show the games connections to other Kingdom Hearts titles. The collection features the game as HD cinematics, much like 358/2 Days was in the HD 1.5 Remix collection.

5|$|Many {{reviews for}} DJ Hero felt the {{addition}} of the non-scoring freeform samples during certain parts of mixes were unnecessary and difficult to use, and with the limited number of samples available, ultimately would lead to overuse and make the mixes sound worse. Reviewers were critical of the game's lackluster multiplayer modes. The DJ-vs-DJ mode was considered poor as both players play the same <b>mix,</b> <b>in</b> consideration of current band-based music games where different players can play different parts of a song. This leads to minimal engagement between players, with each just attempting to maximize their score whenever possible on the controller. While some reviewers considered the DJ-vs-Guitar modes to be fun, others felt it was more a novelty due to the current tracks offered for this mode in the game. The game's graphics were also considered as a negative, often using many strobing lights and creating concerns about possible epilepic seizures that could occur while watching the game. The character designs of the non-celebrity avatars also continued to have the same Muppet-like appearances that occur in the Guitar Hero series, and are overly stereotyped.|$|E
5|$|The character's {{change in}} Part II (Naruto Shippuden) has been praised for {{being one of}} the most {{developed}} ones in the series by Anime News Network's Casey Brienza, as she has become stronger than her Part I (Naruto) counterpart which, was considerably weaker than Naruto and Sasuke. This allows her to take a more active and appealing role in the series. Major praise has been given to her encounters with Sasori and Sasuke owing to her fighting skills and mature reactions, respectively. Sakura's love confession to Naruto in later parts of the series has been commented {{to be one of the}} deepest lines and part of the story arc, for bringing confusion into the <b>mix</b> <b>in</b> regards to whether or not, her love confession claim is as serious as her intention to stop Naruto's suffering. It also came as a surprise as fans wondered what were Sakura's real intention regarding Sasuke who had become a dangerous criminal during such a time in the series. Jason Thompson believes Sakura's feelings were well-handled by Kishimoto. While disliking the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series as she felt it was initially a crush on Sakura's part, Amy McNulty believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden helps to expand the bond between these two as well as their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Sarah Nelkin from Anime Now praised Sakura's development across the series, mostly in late parts of the series due to how she turns into a stronger person as she grows up most notably when she becomes an adult.|$|E

40|$|Language is {{the most}} {{effective}} tool of communication. It is not a simply means of communicating information but also a very important means of establishing and maintaining relationship with other people. In this era, more people can use more than one language in their communication in order to be accepted by society. It happens because they are bilinguals who can speak and understand more than one language. One of the features of becoming bilingual is code mixing. Code mixing is the change of one language to another within the same utterance or in same oral/written text. This study was aimed to get answer of the research problems, namely (1) What are the Indonesian-English code <b>mixing</b> found <b>in</b> the novel My Stupid Boss by Chaos@work? (2) What are the forms of code <b>mixing</b> found <b>in</b> the novel My Stupid Boss by Chaos@work? The objective of this research is to find out the Indonesian-English code <b>mixing</b> used <b>in</b> the novel My Stupid Boss. Besides, it is also intended to know the forms of code <b>mixing</b> found <b>in</b> the novel My Stupid Boss. The design of this research was descriptive qualitative.

In conclusion, the writer used some forms of code mixing, such as: code <b>mixing</b> <b>in</b> word, phrase, hybrid, repetition word, and clause. There was no code <b>mixing</b> <b>in</b> the form of idiom because the characters always mixed their language spontaneously by using simple language in every conversation, so they did not use idiom which sometimes difficult to understand by different people...|$|R
