5|$|The Friends of Richmond Park (FRP) {{was founded}} in 1961 to protect the park. In 1960 the speed limit in the park had been raised from 20 to 30 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> hour and there were {{concerns}} that the roads in the park would be assigned to the main highway system as had recently happened in parts of Hyde Park. In 1969, plans by the then Greater London Council to assign the park's roads to the national highway were revealed by the Friends and subsequently withdrawn. The speed limit was reduced to 20 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> hour {{in the summer of}} 2004.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{was already}} {{concerned}} in 1891 that Europe {{was much more}} advanced in balloon technology than the United States. He sent a letter of concern to the national newspapers claiming that {{if any of the}} European military powers wanted to they could annihilate New York City or any major city in northeastern United States. Newspapers printed his concerns that the next big war would be fought in the sky. Myers pointed out that Germany, France, England, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, Italy and China all had aeronautical apparatus, schools of practice, and secret experimental construction plants making state-of-the-art propeller power driven airships for war. He pointed out as early as October 1890 Commandant Charles Renard was in possession of a motor that could drive La France dirigible airship twenty-eight <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> hour and such an airship or a war airship twice that size traveling at forty-five <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> hour could totally destroy any major city in America without difficulty because of its speed. He was encouraging the government to recognize this and to prepare properly against this potential threat.|$|E
5|$|In Oregon, {{two teenage}} boys (Gary and Richie) are {{exploring}} {{the crash site}} when they encounter Deputy Miles, who denies any crash or the fire that {{was reported in the}} area. While they go through the area on their own, Gary is lifted off the ground and shaken like a rag doll by an invisible force, and Richie, although he stands within a few feet of him, can't see him. Meanwhile, in Washington, Fox Mulder receives a call from Billy <b>Miles,</b> <b>an</b> abductee from Bellefleur whom the agents investigated seven years prior. The younger Miles tells him about Hoese's disappearance, and his concern that the abductions have begun again.|$|E

5|$|After {{their return}} to the U.S., the {{brothers}} and Katharine were invited to the White House where President Taft bestowed awards upon them. Dayton followed up with a lavish two-day homecoming celebration. In July 1909 Orville, with Wilbur assisting, completed the proving flights for the U.S. Army, meeting the requirements of a two-seater able to fly with a passenger for an hour {{at an average of}} speed of 40 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> hour (64km/h) and land undamaged. They sold the airplane to the Army's Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps for $30,000 (which included a $5,000 bonus for exceeding the speed specification). Wilbur climaxed an extraordinary year in early October when he flew at New York City's Hudson-Fulton celebrations, circling the Statue of Liberty and making a 33-minute flight up and down the Hudson River alongside Manhattan in view of up to one million New Yorkers. These flights solidly established the fame of the Wright brothers in America.|$|E

25|$|In the 1928 letter, he recounted what {{happened}} during those early attempts: “At the trials it would start to rise off the ground when a speed of twenty <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> hour was attained. This speed was not sufficient to work the rudders, so, on account of its huge size and low speed, it was uncontrollable, and would spin round broadside directly after it left the ground. So I never flew with my first experimental plane, but no-one else did with their first for that matter”.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} few Australian seasons, Turner {{continued to do}} well even if too little cricket was played for him to equal his records of the late 1880s. In the relatively dry English summer of 1893, Turner still was Australia's leading bowler with 148 wickets at 13.63, but the absence of Ferris and business commitments were slowly taking their toll on him. During this tour his speed was measured electronically at Woolwich Arsenal and timed at 81 feet per second, or 55 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> hour.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, 2008, {{while in}} a {{qualifying}} run for the 2008 Samsung 500 at Texas Motor Speedway, Michael McDowell struck the wall outside of Turn 1 head-on at 190 MPH, and proceeded to barrel-roll eight times as fire came from the engine compartment. McDowell emerged from the Toyota unharmed. The car, along with the SAFER barrier on the track wall, was praised for its safety, as the speed upon impact of the crash was about 30 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> hour more than Dale Earnhardt's fatal accident.|$|E
25|$|On horse-drawn and mule-drawn canals, {{snubbing}} posts {{were used}} to slow or stop a boat in the lock. A 200-ton boat moving at a few <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> hour could destroy the lock gate. To prevent this, a rope was wound around the snubbing post as the boat entered the lock. Pulling on the rope slowed the boat, due to the friction of the rope against the post. A rope 2½ inches (6.3cm) in diameter and about 60 feet (18 meters) long was typically used on the Erie Canal to snub a boat in a lock.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{mindful of}} the need to {{preserve}} their reputation for safety, the railway company allowed only the overall timings for the run to be put into print; neither The Times report of the following day nor Rous-Marten's article in The Railway Magazine of June 1904 mentioned the maximum speed. However, the morning after the run two local Plymouth newspapers did report that the train had reached a speed between 99 and 100 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> hour whilst descending Wellington Bank, Somerset. This claim was based on the stopwatch timings of a postal worker, William Kennedy, who was also on the train.|$|E
25|$|Whisner {{returned}} to the U.S. in March 1952. Whisner continued {{his career as a}} fighter pilot. Whisner also competed in air races, and in 1953, while a Major, he won the 1,900-mile Bendix Trophy Race, flying an F-86F Sabre jet from Edwards Air Force Base in California to Dayton, Ohio, in what was then a record time of 3 hours 5 minutes and 45 seconds, for an average speed of 603.5 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> hour. He served with the 3596th Flying Training Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base until December 1954, when he went to Randolph Air Force Base to serve on the staff of Headquarters Crew Training Air Force.|$|E
25|$|The great Mississippi River {{flood of}} 1927 {{was one of}} the worst natural {{disasters}} in American history. It inundated 27,000 square <b>miles,</b> <b>an</b> area about the size of New England, killing as many as 1,000 people and displacing 700,000 more. At a time when the entire budget of the federal government was barely $3 billion, the flood caused an estimated $1 billion in damage. Although National Guard aviation units had been regularly called upon to assist civil authorities since early in that decade, the 1927 flood marked the first time that an entire Guard flying unit and its government-issued aircraft had been mobilized to help deal with a major natural disaster.|$|E

25|$|Stein {{published}} {{an article on the}} biomechanics of Pteranodon flight. He crafted model Pteranodon wings and tested them in a wind tunnel. He found that Pteranodon was a capable, maneuverable flyer but was best adapted to long distance flights at low velocities. Stein calculated that a large Pteranodon would have to fly at least 10 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> hour to stay airborne. He concluded that Pteranodon would have had to land on its hind feet because making the front feet ready for landing would collapse the wings, which would no longer be useful for keeping the pterosaur aloft. Stein's conclusions contradicted the previous findings of Bramwell and Whitfield.|$|E
25|$|The Kenneth Arnold UFO {{sighting}} {{occurred on}} June 24, 1947, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold {{claimed that he}} saw a string of nine, shiny unidentified flying objects flying past Mount Rainier at speeds that Arnold estimated at a minimum of 1,200 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> hour (1,932km/hr). This was the first post-War sighting in the United States that garnered nationwide news coverage and is credited with being {{the first of the}} modern era of UFO sightings, including numerous reported sightings over the next two to three weeks. Arnold's description of the objects also led to the press quickly coining the terms flying saucer and flying disc as popular descriptive terms for UFOs.|$|E
25|$|By 4 February the BEF front had {{increased}} from 95 miles to 123 <b>miles,</b> <b>an</b> increase of almost 30%. Besides constructing his defences, {{for which he}} had inadequate labour, Gough was formally ordered (Instructions to Fifth Army 9 February, following recommendations by Tavish Davidson on 4 February) to construct defence in depth, including an “emergency defensive zone” along the Somme and Tortille rivers (which run roughly north-south south of Peronne), and a fortified bridgehead around Peronne, from whence “strong counterattacks” were to be conducted when Petain sent the promised reinforcements. GHQ possibly still thought that the main German attack might be elsewhere. Gough had too many men too far forward in positions too far apart to be mutually supporting.|$|E
