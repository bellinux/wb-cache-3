25|$|The {{most common}} type of optical glass is crown glass, which has an index of {{refraction}} of about 1.52. An optimal single-layer coating would have to be made of a material with an index of about 1.23. Unfortunately, there are no solid materials with such a low refractive index. The closest materials with good physical properties for a coating are magnesium fluoride, MgF2 (with an index of 1.38), and fluoropolymers (which can have indices as low as 1.30, but are more difficult to apply). MgF2 on a crown glass surface gives a reflectance of about 1%, compared to 4% for bare glass. MgF2 coatings perform much better on higher-index glasses, especially those with index of refraction close to 1.9. MgF2 coatings are commonly used because they are cheap, and when they are designed for a wavelength {{in the middle of the}} visible band, they give reasonably good anti-reflection over the entire band. Researchers have produced films of <b>mesoporous</b> silica nanoparticles with refractive indices as low as 1.12, which function as antireflection coatings.|$|E
2500|$|Filamentous carbon is a carbon-containing deposit {{structure}} {{that refers to}} several allotropes of carbon, including carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and microcoils.

2500|$|In a QDSC, a <b>mesoporous</b> {{layer of}} {{titanium}} dioxide nanoparticles forms {{the backbone of}} the cell, much like in a DSSC. This [...] layer can then be made photoactive by coating with semiconductor quantum dots using chemical bath deposition, electrophoretic deposition or successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction. The electrical circuit is then completed {{through the use of a}} liquid or solid redox couple. The efficiency of QDSCs has increased to over 5% shown for both liquid-junction and solid state cells. In an effort to decrease production costs, the Prashant Kamat research group demonstrated a solar paint made with [...] and CdSe that can be applied using a one-step method to any conductive surface with efficiencies over 1%. However, the absorption of quantum dots (QDs) in QDSCs is weak at room temperature. The plasmonic nanoparticles can be utilized to address the weak absorption of QDs (e.g., nanostars). Adding an external infrared pumping sources to excite intraband and interband transition of QDs is another solution.|$|E
2500|$|Typically a {{ruthenium}} metalorganic dye (Ru-centered) {{is used as}} a monolayer of light-absorbing material. The dye-sensitized {{solar cell}} depends on a <b>mesoporous</b> layer of nanoparticulate titanium dioxide to greatly amplify the surface area (200–300 m2/g , as compared to approximately 10 m2/g of flat single crystal). The photogenerated electrons from the light absorbing dye are passed on to the n-type [...] and the holes are absorbed by an electrolyte {{on the other side of}} the dye. The circuit is completed by a redox couple in the electrolyte, which can be liquid or solid. This type of cell allows more flexible use of materials and is typically manufactured by screen printing or ultrasonic nozzles, with the potential for lower processing costs than those used for bulk solar cells. However, the dyes in these cells also suffer from degradation under heat and UV light and the cell casing is difficult to seal due to the solvents used in assembly. The first commercial shipment of DSSC solar modules occurred in July 2009 from G24i Innovations.|$|E

50|$|Besides using phytochemicals from plant {{sources to}} act as {{reducing}} agents and stabilizing agents, several other approaches {{have been taken to}} achieve more “green” approaches to gold nanoparticle syntheses. One such approach employs thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG Thiol) to destabilize gold nanoparticles prepared by citrate reduction so that they self-assemble into <b>mesoporous</b> gold sponges. <b>Mesoporous</b> gold sponges are attractive materials for molecular sensing by Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), for catalysis, and for fuel cell construction. The following approach is “green” because PEG Thiol is biocompatible, and because it requires relatively little energy; PEG Thiol-triggered self-assembly of <b>mesoporous</b> gold sponges occurs at room temperature.

50|$|CTAB {{is used as}} the {{template}} for the first report of ordered <b>mesoporous</b> materials. Microporous and <b>mesoporous</b> inorganic solids (with pore diameters of ≤20 Å and ~20-500 Å respectively) have found great utility as catalysts and sorption media because of their large internal surface area. Typical microporous materials are crystalline framework solids, such as zeolites, but the largest pore dimensions are still below 2 nm which greatly limit application. Examples of <b>mesoporous</b> solids include silicas and modified layered materials, but these are invariably amorphous or paracrystalline, with pores that are irregularly spaced and broadly distributed in size. There {{is a need to}} prepare highly ordered <b>mesoporous</b> material with good mesoscale crystallinity. The synthesis of <b>mesoporous</b> solids from the calcination of aluminosilicate gels in the presence of surfactants was reported. The material possesses regular arrays of uniform channels, the dimensions of which can be tailored (in the range of 16 Å to >100 Å) through the choice of surfactant, auxiliary chemicals, and reaction conditions. It was proposed that the formation of these materials takes place by means of a liquid-crystal 'templating' mechanism, in which the silicate material forms inorganic walls between ordered surfactant micelles. CTAB formed micelles in the solution and these micelles further formed a two dimensional hexagonal mesostructure. The silicon precursor began to hydrolyze between the micelles and finally filled the gap with silicon dioxide. The template could be further removed by calcination and left a pore structure behind. These pores mimicked exactly the structure of mesoscale soft template and led to highly ordered <b>mesoporous</b> silica materials.|$|E
