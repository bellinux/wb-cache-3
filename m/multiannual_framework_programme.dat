40|$|The European Union and the European Space Agency {{funded the}} CSC-Data Access {{project in the}} frame of the European Community's Seventh <b>Framework</b> <b>Programme</b> FP 7 / 2007 - 2013 and the <b>Multiannual</b> Financial <b>Framework</b> <b>Programme</b> (MFF). It is an {{integral}} part of the GMES/Copernicus Space Component Programme. The CORE datasets aim at consolidating predefined needs collected from Copernicus services and other activities requesting Earth Observation data whether financed by the Union or related to Union’s policies, like Union financed research projects and the activities of Union agencies (EEA, EMSA, SatCen, etc.) For an initial period of 2007 - 2011, data access management was funded through a data access grant between the EC and ESA. In 2012 the JRC, taking advantage of the first wall-to-wall European dataset with very high resolution (DWH_MG 2 b_CORE_ 03) and being financed by DG REGIO, derived the first European built-up layer, with related information using the GHSL tool, ad hoc tuned on the input dataset (EU GHSL). Through the Data Access Portfolio (DAP) and using the GHSL tool, the JRC Disaster Risk Management Unit could provide European wall-to-wall maps of settlements evolution until 2020. According to the Data Warehouse document which describes the data availability, the acquisition campaign shall be repeated every 3 years taking 2012 as starting reference. Under this condition, at least 2 European mosaic shall be produced (2015 and 2018 referenced). Considering also the DWH_MG 2 b_CORE_ 03, which has been already processed and delivered, maps of settlements of three epochs (2012, 2015, 2018) would be available for studying urban and rural phenomena and trends. The report illustrates the results of initial tests conducted using the EU GHSL tool on the new VHR_IMAGE_ 2015, which promises to be much more accurate and better documented than the previous one.

40|$|This {{paper will}} analyse {{the nature of}} the EU <b>Framework</b> <b>Programme,</b> {{particularly}} its degree of market-orientation and precompetitiveness, {{at the time of the}} Fourth <b>Framework</b> <b>Programme.</b> The paper will show that precompetitiveness as a project or participation attribute is independent of technology or market orientation, with technology orientation meaning participation in the <b>Framework</b> <b>Programme</b> for learning and knowledge, market orientation for commercial objectives. Technology or market orientations appear almost as frequently as basic motivations for company participation in the programme. However, companies usually choose one of the two as their collaboration mode. The paper will further show that the <b>Framework</b> <b>Programme</b> participation by firms continues to be mainly precompetitive.
