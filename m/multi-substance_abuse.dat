He founded and published Sex & Guts Magazine, an independent {{arts and culture}} journal, that ran from 1997 to 2004. Subsequent works include Johnny Behind The Deuce, Sex & Guts Anthology, Sex & Guts 4, Midnight Mavericks, Dog Days: Volume One, Dog Days: Volume Two, Hatchet Job: The Gene Gregorits Reader, and Fishhook. Gregorits' most recent works {{have been described as}} having running themes of poverty, sexual deviance, trauma, mental illness, violence, <b>multi-substance</b> <b>abuse</b> and death. He has said that early influences on his writing included Charles Bukowski and Louis-Ferdinand Céline [...] In 2012 he served as the jury head for the 13th Melbourne Underground Film Festival [...] and was instrumental for Donkey Love, a film about bestiality, being awarded Best Documentary.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Experimental {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that not only dopaminergic signaling but also glutamatergic/NMDA receptor signaling play indispensable roles in the development of methamphetamine psychosis. Our recent genetic studies provided evidence that genetic variants of glutamate-related genes such as DTNBP 1, GLYT 1, and G 72, which are involved in glutamate release and regulation of co-agonists for NMDA receptors, conferred susceptibility to methamphetamine psychosis. Serine racemase converts l-serine to d-serine, which is an endogenous co-agonist for NMDA receptors. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the serine racemase gene (SRR), rs 224770, rs 3760229, and rs 408067, were proven to affect the transcription activity of SRR. Therefore, we examined these SNPs in 225 patients with methamphetamine psychosis and 291 age- and sex-matched controls. There was no significant association between methamphetamine psychosis and any SNP examined or between the disorder and haplotypes comprising the three SNPs. However, rs 408067 was significantly associated with the prognosis for methamphetamine psychosis and <b>multi-substance</b> <b>abuse</b> status. The patients with C-positive genotypes (CC or CG) of rs 408067 showed better prognosis of psychosis afte...|$|E
40|$|The {{background}} {{for this project}} is an internal quality survey from 2013 at the Detoxification Unit of Sørlandet hospital. In recent decades the pattern of substance use among patients admitted for detoxification has changed from predominantly single-substance abuse to simultaneous <b>multi-substance</b> <b>abuse.</b> The evidence base for medication-assisted pharmacological treatment of polydrug users remains inadequate. A non-experimental cohort {{study was conducted with}} 284 polydrug users in the Detoxification Unit of Sørlandet Hospital in 2013. The therapeutic approach was standardised, and was based on social environmental therapy and symptomatic treatment of withdrawal symptoms with valproate and clonidine as key medications. The social environmental therapy was not specifically studied, but it is fair to assume that it had a great impact on the completion rate. Three quarters of the patients were male and they had used more than three different substances on average. The average mean age was 39 years. In total, 75 % of patients completed the detoxification programme, and for 95 % detoxification occurred without complications. In 89 % of cases, the standard treatment protocol was followed. There was a weak but significant correlation between treatment discontinuation and the number of substances used. The completion rate in this study was considerably higher than in previous detoxification studies, and the complication rate was lower. In view of the good results observed and the high degree of standardised treatment, the regimen can be considered a sound safe treatment option for other detoxification units. Key words: Withdrawal, detoxification, narcotics, drug abus...|$|E

The patients with C-positive genotypes (CC or CG) of rs 408067 showed better prognosis of psychosis after therapy and less abuse of multiple substances than the patients with GG genotypes. Because the C allele of rs 408067 reduces the expression of SRR, a lower d-serine level or reduced NMDA receptor activation may affect the prognosis of methamphetamine psychosis and multiple substance abuse. Our sample size is, however, not large enough to eliminate the possibility of a type I error, our findings must be confirmed by replicate studies with larger samples...|$|E
40|$|Drug overdoses are a {{major cause}} of {{mortality}} for drug users and, in many countries, are {{the leading cause of death}} in this group. The aim of the present study is to explore the frequency of all drug related deaths in the Split-Dalmatia County in the period between 1997 and 2007 and to analyze some of the characteristics of these deaths to help target preventive policies. The data on drug related deaths were collected using records from the Department of Forensic Medicine, Clinical Hospital Centre Split, University of Split, School of Medicine. There were 190 drug related deaths in the observed period of 11 years. Statistically significant difference (p= 0. 004, c 2 -test for trend) was found in the number of deaths in 1997 in comparison with the number of deaths in 2007. The majority of 105 (55 %) the decedents were 25 – 34 years old, and 92. 1 % (175) of them were male. There was a 94 % higher probability of mortality in the 25 – 34 years group (c 2 = 5. 55, p= 0. 064). Average age of all dead people was 31. 01 ± 7. 59 years (median 31. 0 years; range 18 – 49). Almost three quarters of the decedents were single and more than three fifths hadn’t been employed. The most common location of death was at home. Approximately, 80 % were autopsied followed by full histological and toxicological analyses. Out of all examined cases, the majority of drug related deaths (93 or 60. 8 %) were attributed to heroin. Heroin was the sole cause of death in 35 (22. 9 %) cases. Methadone was cause of death in 24 (15. 7 %) cases. 3. 4 -methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) deaths were rare (3. 3 %). Cocaine deaths were also rare (1. 3 %). Three fifths (55. 6 %) of the cases involved includes multi-substance use. During the investigation there was an evident trend towards <b>multi-substance</b> <b>abuse</b> patterns. These data suggest that interventions to prevent drug related mortality should address the use of drugs such as heroin and alcohol in combination...|$|E
