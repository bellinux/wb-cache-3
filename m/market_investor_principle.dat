40|$|Die Arbeit stuft Anstaltslast und Gewährträgerhaftung als unzulässige staatliche Beihilfe nach EG-Vertrag ein und schlägt den Geschäftspartnern öffentlichrechtlicher Finanzinstitute vor, sich durch Einfügung vertraglicher Vorkehrungen zur vorzeitigen Beendigung und der Risikoklarlegung abzusichern. Beispiele solcher Vertragsklauseln werden vorgeschlagen. The German {{public law}} {{financial}} institutions {{benefit from an}} enhanced credit standing {{as a consequence of}} institutional and guarantee liability (Anstaltslast and Gewährträgerhaftung) hence are the beneficiaries of aid. The aid granted enables these institutions to fulfill their public duties but also enhances their competitive position, hence represents State Aid according to the EC-Treaty. The application of the State Aid principles of the EC-Treaty are compatible with the tasks assigned to the German public law financial institutions: Whilst property ownership rules must not be affected by the EC-Treaty, Member Sates must not act in a way that contravenes the Treaty provisions. The <b>market</b> economy <b>investor</b> <b>principle</b> does not allow a Member State to grant aid as long as the supported institution remains in an economically viable position. The degree of aid granted can be masured by the enhanced credit rating. The value of unlimited aid is not comparable to civil law concepts such as guarantees, letters of comfort, profit sharing agreements or investor compensation schemes. Institutional and guarantee liability distorts competition. The Commission should therefore order Germany to abolish or alter the aid granted. Counterparties of public law financial institutions should accordingly insert safe harbour provisions/termination provisions/disclosure notes in derivatives, securities, credit and Capital Markets documentation. Sample language is attached...|$|R
40|$|In the future, {{there will}} be rising demand for safe assets, but fewer {{of them will be}} available, {{increasing}} the price for safety in global <b>markets.</b> In <b>principle,</b> <b>investors</b> evaluate all assets based on their intrinsic characteristics. In the absence of market distortions, asset prices tend to reflect their underlying features, including safety. However, factors external to asset markets—including the required use of specific assets in prudential regulations, collateral practices, and central bank operations—may preclude markets from pricing assets efficiently, distorting the price of safety. Before the onset of the global finan-cial crisis, regulations, macroeconomic policies, and market practices had encouraged the underpricing of safety. Some safety features are more accurately reflected now, but upcoming regulatory and market reforms and central bank crisis management strategies, combined with continued uncertainty and a shrinkin...|$|R

Micklitz, European University Institute Professor Andrea Biondi, King's College London Professor Piet Jan Slot, University of Leiden. Defence date: 3 June 2013 This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the legal concept of State aid under Article 107 (1) TFEU. It was born out of the concern that EU institutions and practitioners alike refer to it as if this concept had been immune to the evolution experienced by the context in which it has been applied: the Internal Market. Against this seemingly static background, the thesis argues that the concept of aid is a 'living instrument' that has been applied in accordance with the main policy priorities of the European Commission, a fact that had been underexplored in the literature and the implications of this connection seldom studied. The thesis also contends, contrary to what has been affirmed before by other authors, that the evolution of this concept has been influenced by the broader advancement of the case-law of the Court of Justice in different periods of the integration process. Thirdly, the thesis submits that the study of the origins of subsidy control in Europe, of the legislative history of today's Article 107 (1) TFEU, and of the policy and enforcement considerations that have affected the development of the concept of aid is not only enriching from an intellectual point of view but also useful to decide difficult cases. In this regard, the thesis provides criteria to interpret and discuss cases, e. g. Sloman Neptun, Philip Morris or Azores, beyond the analysis traditionally carried out in this field, too often limited to the compatibility of these cases with the effects-based formula traditionally followed to define aid. Indeed, the emergence of that formula, of the <b>Market</b> Economy <b>Investor</b> <b>Principle</b> test, the Adria-Wien test for selectivity, the ups-and-downs of the De Minimis rule in this field, or the exclusion of regulatory measures from the notion of State resources, cannot be understood only by looking at the economic or even the strictly legal reasoning behind the relevant judgments. Instead, historical, policy and enforcement considerations are useful interpretative tools to fully grasp these developments, a point that this thesis contributes to making...|$|R

30|$|Finally, {{our study}} also has {{important}} policy implications. Our {{results show that}} CSR performance is not associated with higher valuation or improvements in the financial performance of the firm. Firms seeking cross-listing may face demands from host <b>market</b> <b>investors</b> to improve their CSR performance that are not fully appreciated by their home <b>market</b> <b>investors.</b> As such, firms seeking cross-listing need to trade off between the demands from their host and home markets.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} the choice of the destination market for cross-listing and the home bias of investors. We use two measures of home bias, the domestic bias (the degree of overinvestment in the home market), and the foreign bias (the degree of over-/under-investment in a foreign market). First, we find a strong relation between the domestic bias of investors and cross-listing decisions of firms. In particular, the level of cross-listing activity of firms from a particular market is negatively related to the domestic bias of the home <b>market</b> <b>investors,</b> while the level of cross-listing activity of firms towards a particular market is negatively related to the domestic bias of the host <b>market</b> <b>investors.</b> Second, we find a strong relation between the foreign bias and cross-listings. In particular, the level of cross-listing activity from one market to another is positively related to the foreign bias in investments allocation of the home <b>market</b> <b>investors</b> {{as well as of the}} host <b>market</b> <b>investors.</b> Overall, these results suggest that corporate managers, when making a cross-listing decision, may be prone to the same behavioral/familiarity bias as investors...|$|R
