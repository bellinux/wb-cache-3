40|$|Abstract: Evidence of the {{pharmacological}} {{activity of}} traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) provides {{the basis for}} clinical prescription. Study of the classification of Chinese medicines according to these activities is key to understanding the general active tendencies of <b>medicinal</b> <b>prescriptions,</b> exploring their material basis, investigating their properties and searching for their alternatives. Taking the herbal classic Shennong’s Materia Medica Classic (Shennong Bencao Jing) for the data source, this paper studied the classification of Chinese medicines based on semi-supervised incremental clustering algorithm using “micro-cluster” concept in order to investigate the complex similarity among Chinese medicines. The results showed that 253 Chinese medicines were reasonably classified into 14 types, such as invigoration, clearing heat, diuresis, dredging blockages in the channels, treating gynecological conditions and treating strange diseases caused by ghosts. The results also showed that the other 112 Chinese medicines were classified into 112 individual types and the same high similarity to different known types was {{the main reason for}} this. The semi-supervised incremental clustering algorithm employed in the study had a high quality and a good development for clustering which is suitable for classification of Chinese medicines.

Animals were treated with DSS for 2 months, and step-down test and Morris water maze (MWM) test were used to evaluated cognitive abilities. The estradiol (E 2), NO, and glycine in blood plasma or in hippocampus were detected to explore the possible mechanisms. The latency of SAMP 8 in step-down test was shorter than that of age-matched SAMR 1, and DSS increased the latency especially in female animals. In MWM test, we got similar results; SAMP 8 spent more time to find the platform, and DSS decreased the time before finding the platform, with little effect on swim velocity, during the training sessions. During test session, DSS increased the time spent in target quadrant especially in female SAMP 8. In female SAMP 8, plasma E 2, NO, and glycine were elevated in plasma or hippocampus tissue.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The risks {{attributed}} to drug-herb interactions, even when known, are often ignored or underestimated, {{especially for those}} involving anti-clotting drugs and Chinese medicines. The {{aim of this study}} was to structurally search and evaluate the existing evidence-based data associated with potential drug interactions between anticoagulant/antiplatelet drugs and Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) and evaluate the documented mechanisms, consequences, and/or severity of interactions. METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: Information related to anticoagulant/antiplatelet drug-CHM interactions was retrieved from eight interaction-based textbooks, four web resources and available primary biomedical literature. The primary literature searches were conducted in English and/or Chinese from January 2000 through December 2011 using the secondary databases (e. g., PubMed, Airiti Library, China Journal full-text database). The search terms included the corresponding medical subject headings and key words. Herbs or natural products not used as a single entity CHM or in Chinese <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Prescriptions</b> were excluded from further review. The corresponding mechanisms and severity ratings of interactions were retrieved using MicroMedex®, Lexicomp® and Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database®. Finally, we found 90 single entity CHMs contributed to 306 documented drug-CHM interactions. A total of 194 (63. 4 %) interactions were verified for its evidence describing possible mechanisms and severity. Of them, 155 interactions (79. 9 %) were attributable to pharmacodynamic interactions, and almost all were rated as moderate to severe interactions. The major consequences of these interactions were increased bleeding risks due to the additive anticoagulant or antiplatelet effects of the CHMs, specifically danshen, dong quai, ginger, ginkgo, licorice, and turmeric. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Conventional anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs were documented to have harmful interactions with some commonly used single entity CHMs. For those patients who are taking conventional anti-clotting medications with CHMs for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, the potential risks of increased bleeding due to drug-CHM interactions should not be ignored...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Medicinal plants used by {{the local}} people in Xizang (Tibet) have been {{investigated}} since the 1960 s. The others out of Xizang, however, have been less understood, although they may be easily and strongly influenced by the various local herbal practices, diverse environments, local religious beliefs and different prevalent types of diseases. In 2006, two ethnobotanical surveys were organized in the county of Shangri-la, Yunnan Province, SW China, to document the traditional medicinal plants {{used by the}} Tibetan people. Methods After literature surveying, four local townships were selected {{to carry out the}} field investigation. Three local healers were interviewed as key informants. The methods of ethnobotany, anthropology and participatory rural appraisal (PRA) were used in the field surveys. Plant taxonomic approach was adopted for voucher specimen identification. Results Sixty-eight medicinal plant species in 64 genera of 40 families were recorded and collected. Among them, 23 species were found to have medicinal values that have not been recorded in any existing Tibetan literatures before, and 31 species were recorded to have traditional prescriptions. Moreover, the traditional preparations of each species and some folk medicinal knowledge were recorded and analyzed. These traditional <b>prescriptions,</b> preparations, new <b>medicinal</b> plants and folk medicinal knowledge and principles were discovered and summarized by local traditional Tibetan healers through times of treatment practices, and were passed down from generation to generation. Conclusion As a part of the cultural diversity of Tibetan community, these traditional medicinal knowledge and experiences may provide data and information basis for the sustainable utilization and development of Tibetan medicine, and may contribute to the local economic development. However, for many reasons, they are disappearing gradually as time goes by. Our study showed that there were abundant traditional Tibetan <b>medicinal</b> <b>prescriptions</b> and using methods. It implies that more Tibetan medicinal plants and traditional knowledge can be discovered.

It {{has been reported that}} Pterocephalus hookeri has anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions. However, the antitumor activity of Pterocephalus hookeri remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that n-butanol extracts of Pterocephalus hookeri (YSC-ZDC) has a strong antitumor activity against hepatoma carcinoma cell in vitro and in vivo. YSC-ZDC inhibited proliferation of all cancer cell lines and significantly inhibited Hep 3 B cells proliferation in a dose- and time-dependant manner. Transmission electron microscopy, hoechst 33258 staining, and flow cytometry analysis revealed that YSC-ZDC induced apoptosis in Hep 3 B cells. YSC-ZDC treatment dramatically inhibited PDK 1 and Akt phosphorylation in Hep 3 B cells. Moreover, YSC-ZDC increased Bax expression and inhibited Bcl- 2 expression. In addition, YSC-ZDC inhibited growth hepatoma xenografts in vivo with no effect on body weight and spleen index. Consistent with results in vitro, YSC-ZDC increased Bax expression and inhibited Bcl- 2 expression in tumor tissue.

In this study, an ultrafast liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (UFLCMS/MS) method was developed to separate and to simultaneously determine 14 major active ingredients in SXD. Chromatographic separation was successfully accomplished on an Acquity BEH C 18 (100  mm× 2. 1  mm, 1. 7  μm) column using gradient elution with 0. 1 % (v/v) formic acid water (A) and 0. 1 % (v/v) formic acid in methanol (B). Negative and positive electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was used to detect the 14 analytes using its selective reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. A good linear regression relationship for each analyte was obtained over the range from 3. 88  ng/mL to 4080  ng/mL. The precision was evaluated by intra- and inter-day assays with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 6. 25 %.

Information on the use of drugs during pregnancy is not available in Pakistan. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the patterns of drug prescriptions to pregnant women in tertiary care hospitals of Pakistan. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted at five tertiary care hospitals of Pakistan. Copies of outpatient <b>medicinal</b> <b>prescriptions</b> given to pregnant patients attending the antenatal clinics were collected. The drugs were classified according to the pharmacological class and their teratogenic potential. Results All the pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics received a prescription containing at least one drug. A total of 3769 distinct prescriptions given to different women were collected. Majority of the women who received the prescriptions belonged to third trimester (55. 4 %) followed by second (33. 6 %) and first trimester (11. 0 %). On an average, each prescription contained 1. 66 ± 0. 14 drugs. The obstetricians at Civil Hospital, Karachi and Chandka Medical College Hospital, Larkana showed a tendency of prescribing lesser number of drugs compared to those in other hospitals. Anti-anemic drugs including iron preparations and vitamin and mineral supplements (79. 4 %) were the most frequently prescribed drugs followed by analgesics (6. 2 %) and anti-bacterials (2. 2 %). 739 women (19. 6 %) received prescriptions containing drugs other than vitamin or mineral supplements. Only 1275 (21. 6 %) of all the prescribed drugs (n = 6100) were outside this vitamin/mineral supplement class. Out of these 1275 drugs, 29 (2. 3 %) drugs were prescribed which are considered to be teratogenic. Misoprostol was the most frequently prescribed (n = 6) among the teratogenic drugs followed by carbimazole (n = 5) and methotrexate (n = 5). Twenty nine pregnant women (0. 8 % of all the women studied) were prescribed these teratogenic drugs.

40|$|Changing from paper-based {{systems to}} digital {{mechanisms}} means that personal information becomes more easily accessible {{and more difficult}} to control and secure. When the paper-based practice is in a sector such as healthcare, concerns for patient privacy protection are great. In paper-based prescribing in the United Kingdom’s National Health Service (NHS), patients are responsible for protecting the privacy of their prescription information while it is in transit from the prescriber to the dispenser. The UK government has introduced a plan for future NHS reform that includes a change from paper-based prescribing to a national electronic transfer of prescriptions (ETP) system. 1 This brings with it concerns for patient data privacy and questions about the burden of trust placed on professionals in the ETP system. As recently seen in the Emilio Calatayud case in the United States, 2 systems that contain an aggregation of identifiable personal information can be abused. A similar case could result from malpractice in an ETP system. We have developed and implemented an ETP system for the UK NHS. 3 We present our system for protecting the privacy of patient data, describe how we implemented it in Java, and discuss how others can use our system for other applications {{both inside and outside the}} healthcare sector. Patient data privacy in the digital age In paper-based prescription systems, patients visit their general practitioner (GP) or prescribing nurse or dentist and receive a paper <b>medicinal</b> <b>prescription</b> that the prescriber signs. Generally, patients can take this prescription to any pharmacist in the country for dispensation. This also provides flexibility because they do not have to decide in advance from which pharmacist to collect their medication, nor must they choose a specific time to visit the pharmacist (prescriptions in the UK are valid for six months). Transitioning from paper-prescribing practices to ETP could change who holds the responsibility of protecting patients ’ privacy. Patients might no longer solely control their data’s privacy while their prescription moves through the ETP system—that control might lie with them, healthcare professionals, or the administrators of a central electronic prescription storage device...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} Chinese traditional <b>medicinal</b> <b>prescription,</b> JIANPI HUOXUE decoction (JHD) on cytokine secretion pathway in rat liver induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: Twenty-four male SD rats were divided into normal group (n = 4), model group (n = 10) and JHD group (n = 10) randomly. Rats in model group and JHD group were administrated with normal saline or JHD via gastrogavage respectively twice a day for 3 d. One hour after the last administration, rats were injected with LPS via tail vein, 50 μg/kg. Simultaneously, rats in normal group were injected with equivalent normal saline. After LPS stimulation for 1. 5 h, serum and liver tissue were collected. Pathological change of liver tissues was observed through hematoxylin-eosin (H. E.) staining. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in serum were assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protein expression of TNF-α, phosphorylated inhibit-κB (p-IκB) and CD 68 in liver were assayed by Western blot. The distribution of CD 68 protein in liver was observed through immunohistochemical staining. The mRNA expression of TNF-α, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), CD 14, toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2) and TLR 4 in liver were assayed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Predominant microvesicular change, hepatocyte tumefaction and cytoplasm dilution were observed in liver tissues after LPS administration as well as obvious CD 68 positive staining in hepatic sinusoidal. After LPS stimulation, serum TNF-α (31. 35 ± 6. 06 vs 12 225. 40 ± 9007. 03, P < 0. 05), protein expression of CD 68 (1. 13 ± 0. 49 vs 3. 36 ± 1. 69, P < 0. 05), p-IκB (0. 01 ± 0. 01 vs 2. 07 ± 0. 83, P < 0. 01) and TNF-α (0. 27 ± 0. 13 vs 1. 29 ± 0. 37, P < 0. 01) in liver and mRNA expression of TNF-α (1. 96 ± 2. 23 vs 21. 45 ± 6. 00, P < 0. 01), IL- 6 (4. 80 ± 6. 42 vs 193. 50 ± 36. 36, P < 0. 01) and TLR 2 (1. 44 ± 0. 62 vs 4. 16 ± 0. 08, P < 0. 01) in liver were also increased significantly. These pathological changes were all improved in JHD group. On the other hand, TLR 4 mRNA (1. 22 ± 0. 30 vs 0. 50 ± 0. 15, P < 0. 05) was down-regulated and CD 14 mRNA increased but not significantly after LPS stimulation. CONCLUSION: JHD can inhibit cytokine secretion pathway induced by LPS in rat liver, which is probably associated with its regulation on CD 68, p-IκB and endotoxin receptor TLR 2...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the existence and}} use of opium in ancient Egypt, its introduction {{in the country and}} references to opium as a <b>medicinal</b> ingredient. Some <b>prescriptions</b> in medical papyri are mentioned as records confirming the application of opium. Objects are mentioned as records of the drug presence in Egypt. Whether it was used only as a medicine but also as a recreational drug is here discussed. The attempt to date the introduction of the Papaver somniferum L. plant in ancient Egypt is also developed. Scientific data were consulted, but it is needed to note that some authors present different views. Nevertheless, this paper suggests that opium may have been introduced in ancient Egypt in the New Kingdom (c. 1550 - 1350 BCE), although records for the commerce of the drug may point {{to the end of the}} Ptolemaic Period, influencing Greek medicine and expanding its use throughout the Roman Period onwards...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{countries}} are providing pharmaceutical grade cannabis to chronically ill patients. However, little published data {{is known about the}} extent of medicinal cannabis use and the characteristics of patients using cannabis on doctor's prescription. This study describes a retrospective database study of The Netherlands. Complete dispensing histories were obtained of all patients with at least one <b>medicinal</b> cannabis <b>prescription</b> gathered at pharmacies in The Netherlands in the period 2003 - 2010. Data revealed prevalence and incidence of use of prescription cannabis as well as characteristics of patients using different cannabis varieties. Five thousand five hundred forty patients were identified. After an initial incidence of about 6 / 100, 000 inhabitants/year in 2003 and 2004, the incidence remained stable at 3 / 100, 000 /year in 2005 - 2010. The prevalence rate ranged from 5 to 8 per 100, 000 inhabitants. Virtually all patients used some form of prescription medication in the 6 months preceding start of cannabis use, most particularly psycholeptics (45. 5 %), analgesics (44. 3 %), anti-ulcer agents (35. 9 %) and NSAIDs (30. 7 %). We found no significant association between use of medication of common indications for cannabis (pain, HIV/AIDS, cancer, nausea, glaucoma) and variety of cannabis used. This is the first nationwide study into the extent of <b>prescription</b> of <b>medicinal</b> cannabis. Although the cannabis varieties studied are believed to possess different therapeutic effects based on their different content of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), no differences in choice of variety was found associated with indication. ...|$|R
40|$|Collaborative {{research}} in northern Peru in summer 2013 strengthened connections {{that have been}} formed over the years with the important actors in the Peru Ethnomedical Project. Working closely with me (via Skype and email) and my colleague Dr. Douglas Sharon, University of California, Berkeley (retired), the first thing Sam Gauksheim did was conduct interviews over the span of a few weeks with Dr. Luis Fernández, {{the director of the}} EsSalud Complementary Medicine clinic in Trujillo, which supplies insured patients with <b>medicinal</b> plant <b>prescriptions.</b> (Two Linfield students and I had worked closely with Dr. Fernández in a summer 2012 clinic patient survey.) We gathered information about the health care system in Peru and the referral process for patients that are sent to the EsSalud Complementary Medicine program. Based on these interviews we were able to write up a summary {{of the health care system}} and the medicinal plant program in both English and Spanish. We later included this information in a comprehensive report about the status of the project and complementary medicine in northern Peru. Accompanied by fellow students from several U. S. research universities, we also traveled to the mountain town of Huamachuco, about a five hour bus ride east of Trujillo. With the intention of finding support for a medicinal plant supply chain to the coast, there we scheduled meetings with the director of the EsSalud clinic, visited the hospital and learned directly about the greenhouse project a Peace Corps volunteer was doing with a local women’s group. We also went up to the farm that Gabe Chait worked on during his Fulbright research, where we found the locals learning sustainable farming practices from a Peruvian NGO. Back in Trujillo, Dr. Sharon and I visited the site museum at Chan Chan, where we spoke with the director about expanding on the medicinal plant demonstration garden that Linfield students had constructed in 2010 there as part of their future renovation...|$|R
40|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} those plants that provide medicines- to prevent disease, {{maintain}} health or cure sickness. In one or other form, these plants benefit virtually {{everyone on the}} Earth. These plants are also related to various other usages, such as for nutrition, toiletry, bodily care, incense and ritual healing. Aromatic plants are used for their aroma and flavour and many times these two groups become inseparable in terms of usages. In recent years a great demand of aromatic plants has increased because of increasing interest in aromatherapy. The use of plants for medicines {{is by far the}} biggest use of plants in term of the number of species specifically targeted. Plants provide the predominant ingredients of medicines in most traditional systems of healing and have been the source of inspiration for several new drug search to major pharmaceutical companies. There are three kinds of herbal medicines available in the market: raw medicinal plants material, processed medicinal plants material and medicinal plants herbal products. India has a long history and tradition as well as rich heritage of using medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) for health care and beauty in improving the quality of life. India is also fortunate, perhaps, to have the richest reservoir of traditional herbal <b>medicinal</b> plants and <b>prescriptions.</b> The Indian systems of medicines comprise of Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani are having their deep roots in our society. Ayurveda is about 5000 years old and predominantly use medicinal plants for their preparation and formulations. Modern pharmacopeia also enlisted about 25 % of drugs derived from plants. A vast majority of modern drugs although synthetic analogues but built on prototype compounds isolated from plants. The present era is witnessing a fascinatin...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} dealing with the impact of the Regulation fees cancelation on demand of Ambulant healthcare. The introductory part of theoretical thesis is describing the development of health care in regards to various financial models within the medical environment. At the beginning of this thesis, all known health care financial models are named and described in the worldwide scope. After the initial description, the bachelor thesis focuses on specific models and their development during the important stages from {{the second half of the}} 19 th century until current era of the Czech Republic. The current health care system in the Czech Republic is based on public services and financed mainly from public sources. The health care system has multiple sources that help sustain it financially. The prevalent form is indirect financing, specifically the mandatory health insurance. Health care financing has gone through important developments that should not be forgotten. Furthermore, the theoretical part of the thesis also contains a detailed description of regulatory fees. It shows different types and functionalities of regulatory fees since their implementation by the law number 261 / 2007 (stabilizing of public budgets), until their cancellation on January 1 st, 2015. The regulation fee was implemented by the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic in efforts to solve the increasing deficit of the state budget, and increase the efficiency of the health care system.) The income increase, caused by regulation fees, should serve as a starting point in an era of modernizing of medical facilities and maintaining the overall quality of health care for patients. In the scientific part of the thesis, the main scope and the two types of research are being set. The quantitative research is aimed on a group of patients. The hypotheses of the research are as follows. Hypothesis number 1 : The cancellation of regulatory fees leads to the increase in demand of a specialized ambulant care. Hypothesis number 2 : The cancellation of regulatory fees for a prescription leads to a higher demand of prescribed medication. A questionnaire was used to determine the results of the research, which will either confirm or deny the presented hypotheses. The method used to receive the results was a frequency analysis that was completed by a statistician. The secondary, qualitative, research is deliberately used to ensure the accuracy of the completed and compared data. This research, which was run simultaneously with the quantitative one, targeted a group of health care professionals, specifically medical doctors. The data collected in the form of a structuralized set of interviews were used to be analyzed as a key to answer the research questions: Research question number 1 : After cancellation of the regulatory fees, was there an increase in the amount of visits of patients with a specific health care provider? Research question number 2 : Does the health care demand need to be regulated? Based on the research displayed within the thesis, it is possible to predicate: The questionnaire method lead to a confirmation of hypothesis number 1 and also to the conclusion that the cancellation of 30 CZK fee lead to an increase in demand of health care services. The research question number 1 also confirms that after the 30 CZK fee cancellation there was an increase in patient visits of health care facilities. The results are contradicting the findings within the hypothesis number 2, as there was no higher demand in prescribed medication after the regulation fee for medication was cancelled. The comparison of the data that was collected through both types of the research does not prove a direct connection in the increased demand of patients for <b>medicinal</b> drug <b>prescription</b> after the 30 CZK regulation fee cancellation. We can safely state in regards of the research question number number 2 that regulation of health care is a necessity...|$|R
