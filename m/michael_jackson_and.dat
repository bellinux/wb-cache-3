25|$|Breaking, {{also called}} B-boying/B-girling or breakdancing, is a dynamic, rhythmic style of dance which {{developed}} {{as one of}} the major elements of hip hop culture.

Breaking took form in the South Bronx in the 1970s alongside the other elements of hip hop. Breakdancing is typically done with the accompaniment of hip hop music playing on a boom box or PA system.|$|E

25|$|At work, Cindy {{searches}} through {{pictures of}} lighthouses before finding {{the one from}} the tape. Desperate to save Cody, Cindy warns everyone by entering a message into the news anchor's teleprompter. Her boss interrupts her, and the anchor mechanically recites the wrong message. The Logans take it seriously since they encountered an alien disguised as <b>Michael</b> <b>Jackson,</b> <b>and</b> President Baxter Harris personally visits the farm to investigate the crop circles. Cindy visits the lighthouse, where she encounters The Architect. The loquacious (and lecherous) old man explains Tabitha was his evil adopted daughter, whom his wife drowned in the farm's well, but not before she imprinted her evil onto the tape. Unfortunately, he mistakenly returned it to Blockbuster, unleashing the curse. When Cindy asks about how this relates to the Aliens, the Architect speculates that Tabitha is summoning them to aid her in destroying the human race.|$|E
25|$|After {{working at}} Norman J. Lewis, Friedman began {{considering}} his own concepts for toy products. In 1970, he formed LJN Toys Ltd., which created toy lines {{and video games}} based on movies, television shows and celebrities. The company was established with the financial backing of Friedman's employer, Norman J. Lewis, who later sold {{his interest in the}} company to a Chinese investor. After Lewis moved on, Friedman remained committed to promoting the company's growth and focused the company's strategy toward licensing. Basing toys on popular characters wasn't a new concept, but Friedman had an instinct for recognizing blockbusters, could conceive products for diverse audiences, and could negotiate and execute licenses quickly, which brought the practice to a new level. LJN found initial success making merchandise from the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Friedman continued to acquire licenses, personally meeting with celebrities such as <b>Michael</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>and</b> Brooke Shields, before making dolls based on their figure.|$|E
25|$|Koons {{then moved}} on to the Banality series. For this project he engaged {{workshops}} in Germany and Italy that had a long tradition of working in ceramic, porcelain, and wood. The series culminated in 1988 with <b>Michael</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>and</b> Bubbles, a series of three life-size gold-leaf plated porcelain statues of the sitting singer cuddling Bubbles, his pet chimpanzee. Three years later, one of these sold at Sotheby's New York for US$5.6 million. Two of these sculptures are now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) in downtown Los Angeles. The statue was included in a 2004 retrospective at the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo which traveled a year later to the Helsinki City Art Museum. It also featured in his second retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, in 2008. The statue is currently back at the newly opened Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art at Tjuvholmen in Oslo.|$|E
