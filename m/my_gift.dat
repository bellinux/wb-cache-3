5|$|At 12, Westenra {{entered a}} {{professional}} recording studio to record Walking in the Air, a demo album originally created {{for friends and}} family. At first, her parents paid for 70 copies; soon after, 1,000 more were cut for sale, hand-out, and publicity. After finishing her album, Westenra and her sister Sophie busked in Christchurch, giving away {{a few of the}} original 70 albums (at the behest of passersby) and selling some of the latter 1000. The pair drew large crowds, and one woman asked the girls if they had ever recorded anything. The woman, a journalist with Canterbury Television, asked Westenra to appear on air. Gray Bartlett, the director of a concert promotion company, saw the show and became interested in working with Westenra. Shortly after, she was offered a recording deal with Universal Records New Zealand. On that label, Westenra, who in the meantime was attending Burnside High School, released a self-titled album of show tunes and light classical songs, as well as <b>My</b> <b>Gift</b> to You, a CD of Christmas music. Following the success of her albums, she was offered and later received lessons from Dame Malvina Major.|$|E

He just {{may be the most}} popular black singer ever." [...] In 1990, Vanity Fair cited Jackson as the most popular artist in the history of show business. In 2003, Daily Telegraph writer Tom Utley described Jackson as [...] "extremely important" [...] and a [...] "genius". In 2007, Jackson said: [...] "Music has been my outlet, <b>my</b> <b>gift</b> to all of the lovers in this world. Through it, my music, I know I will live forever." ...|$|E

[...] "I had CDs and tape of new songs in the car. I {{came up with this}} one line, 'I found a way to make you smile.' All I knew was The Beach Boys had a record or a song called Smile– is that right?– so I was like, 'Well, this will be <b>my</b> <b>gift</b> to [...] Peter and Mike, and Bill at the time. It was hard to write. It was a high order to say, 'I found a way to make you smile.' I had to come up with, 'OK, what are those ways?' That was tough." [...] Of the line, 'I found a way to make you smile', Stipe later recalled, [...] "I just thought, that's the most beautiful thing in the world." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{some of the}} raw moments {{captured}} in the documentary, Beyoncé appears completely bare. During one video, Beyoncé cries and asks herself: [...] "Why did God give me this life? Sometimes it's overwhelming. Why did God give me my talent, <b>my</b> <b>gift,</b> my family. But I know you're not supposed to question God." [...] She told Entertainment Tonight: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} a little different with the film ... I wanted people to re-experience the show in a different way. Everyone that had been to the show -- I wanted them to see things that they didn't get to see. I figured it would be cool for everyone to see it from my point of view. It's a peek behind the curtain ... honestly, more than no makeup, the emotions and just being so real and raw, I don't think I'd be able to let down my guard the way I did if anybody was in the room." [...] The last minutes of the film get very sentimental, with a performance of Etta James's classic [...] "At Last" [...] set to the backdrop of Civil Rights-era footage, followed by a close-up moment when Beyoncé admits that her life can be overwhelming, although she is blessed, stating, [...] "I'm grateful... I'm alive and I'm living my dreams." [...] The film's final performance shows Beyoncé performing [...] "Halo" [...] and sees her paying tribute to Michael Jackson. She also splices in footage of an old video from the night she attended her first Michael Jackson concert as a child. At the end of the performance, the whole production wraps as Beyoncé throws up the Roc sign and exits the stage.|$|E

2500|$|A planned {{film version}} of [...] "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" [...] to star Diamond and Streisand fell through when Diamond instead starred in a 1980 remake of the Al Jolson classic The Jazz Singer {{alongside}} Laurence Olivier and Lucie Arnaz. Though the movie received poor reviews, the soundtrack spawned three Top 10 singles, [...] "Love on the Rocks", [...] "Hello Again", and [...] "America", the last of which had emotional significance for Diamond. [...] "'America' {{was the story of}} my grandparents," [...] he told an interviewer. [...] "It's <b>my</b> <b>gift</b> to them, and it's very real for me ... In a way, it speaks to the immigrant in all of us." [...] The song was performed in full by Diamond during the finale of the film.

2500|$|The title 10,000 Days {{refers to}} roughly the orbital {{period of the}} planet Saturn (actual time period is 10,759 days), which adds up to nearly 29 years and marks, {{according}} to Keenan, [...] "the time when you are presented the opportunity to transform from whatever your hang-ups were before to let the light of knowledge and experience lighten your load, so to speak, and let go of old patterns and embrace a new life." [...] Keenan expected that the songs composed would [...] "chronicle that process, hoping that <b>my</b> <b>gift</b> back would be to share that path and hope that I could help somebody get past that spot." [...] It is rumoured that the album is a reference to Maynard James Keenan's mother who was paralyzed for 10,000 days (27 years) before she died.|$|E
2500|$|This {{interest}} in education continued into her opera career. For many years, Blackwell {{participated in a}} program called the [...] "Affiliate Artists" [...] where {{she went into the}} community and talked to people one-on-one to educate them about and inspire {{interest in}} opera. Blackwell says, [...] "We don't have audience participation anymore, partly because of being raised on television. We have become an audience that receives entertainment in a passive way. I think in order to participate you have to have knowledge and knowledge means {{you have to take the}} time to sit down and educate. When you are able to communicate with people and show them you're just another human being with a gift, it makes all the difference. <b>My</b> <b>gift</b> happens to be singing. When you go to an opera you see so many people, but you don't have an opportunity to have that one-on-one contact and that's what was so great about that program." ...|$|E
