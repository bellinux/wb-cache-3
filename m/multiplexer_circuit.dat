At the same time, mobile devices need to adapt their communication techniques {{so as to be}} able to work with different communication standards. The need for a multistandard communication circuit arises to overcome such a problem. Unfortunately, these circuits need to consume a considerable amount of power to achieve their designed goal. The researchers use the Dynamic Voltage / Frequency Scheduling technique to reduce power consumption in digital systems. This method employs the task time to schedule the system supply voltage along the task time to reduce the overall consumed power. Since the task time in digital communication systems is not defined, the application of the dynamic voltage/frequency technique on such systems is not possible. In this research, a closer look at the digital circuit power dissipation is given. Then, a new power model is introduced which can predict the digital circuit instantaneous power dissipation accurately. This model is used to build a power control strategy that makes use of the frequency as a control parameter.
