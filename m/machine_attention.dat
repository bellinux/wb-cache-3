40|$|Image {{and video}} {{captioning}} are important tasks in visual data analytics, as they concern {{the capability of}} describing visual content in natural language. They are the pillars of query answering systems, improve indexing and search and allow a natural form of human-machine interaction. Even though promising deep learning strategies are becoming popular, the heterogeneity of large image archives makes this task still far from being solved. In this paper we explore how visual saliency prediction can support image captioning. Recently, some forms of unsupervised <b>machine</b> <b>attention</b> mechanisms have been spreading, but the role of human attention prediction has never been examined extensively for captioning. We propose a <b>machine</b> <b>attention</b> model driven by saliency prediction to provide captions in images, which can be exploited for many services on cloud and on multimedia data. Experimental evaluations are conducted on the SALICON dataset, which provides groundtruths for both saliency and captioning, and on the large Microsoft COCO dataset, {{the most widely used}} for image captioning...|$|E

Finally, we categorize some existing strategies for drawing people’s attention according to a simple symbiotic (human- <b>machine)</b> <b>attention</b> management framework...|$|E

We define an annotation task and crowdsource it for 100 audiobook reviews with 1, 662 sentences and 3 aspects: story, performance, and overall quality. The dataset is suitable for intrinsic evaluation of explicit document models with attention mechanisms, for multi-aspect sentiment analysis and summarization. We evaluated one such document attention model which uses weighted multiple-instance learning to jointly model aspect ratings and sentence-level rating contributions, and found that there is positive correlation between human and <b>machine</b> <b>attention</b> especially for sentences with high human agreement...|$|E

The “Type 102” answered a call for a small, economical family car and was based mechanically on Fiat’s 127 hatchback. The styling of the car also owed much to the contemporary small Italian Autobianchi Abarth, which was never available in the United Kingdom.|$|R
40|$|Gaze {{reflects}} how humans process visual {{scenes and}} is therefore increasingly used in computer vision systems. Previous works demonstrated the potential of gaze for object-centric tasks, such as object localization and recognition, but it remains unclear if gaze can also be beneficial for scene-centric tasks, such as image captioning. We present {{a new perspective on}} gaze-assisted image captioning by studying the interplay between human gaze and the attention mechanism of deep neural networks. Using a public large-scale gaze dataset, we first assess the relationship between state-of-the-art object and scene recognition models, bottom-up visual saliency, and human gaze. We then propose a novel split attention model for image captioning. Our model integrates human gaze information into an attention-based long short-term memory architecture, and allows the algorithm to allocate attention selectively to both fixated and non-fixated image regions. Through evaluation on the COCO/SALICON datasets we show that our method improves image captioning performance and that gaze can complement <b>machine</b> <b>attention</b> for semantic scene understanding tasks...|$|E

Our experiments on large-scale Chinese-to-English task show that our model improves both translation and alignment qualities significantly over the large-vocabulary neural machine translation system, and even beats a state-of-the-art traditional syntax-based system.

40|$|Abstract In toxicology, {{hazardous}} substances detected in organisms may {{often lead to}} different pathological conditions {{depending on the type}} of exposure and level of dosage; hence, further analysis on this can suggest the best cure. Urine profiling may serve the purpose because samples typically contain hundreds of compounds representing an effective metabolic fingerprint. This paper proposes a pattern recognition procedure for determining the type of cadmium dosage, acute or chronic, administrated to laboratory rats, where urinary profiles are detected using capillary electrophoresis. The procedure is based on the composition of a sample data matrix consisting of areas of common peaks, with appropriate pre-processing aimed at reducing the lack of reproducibility and enhancing the potential contribution of low-level metabolites in discrimination. The matrix is then used for pattern recognition including principal components analysis, cluster analysis, discriminant analysis and support vector <b>machines.</b> <b>Attention</b> is particularly focussed on the last of these techniques, because of its novelty and some attractive features such as its suitability to work with datasets that are small and/or have low samples/variable ratios. The type of cadmium administration is detected as a relevant feature that contributes to the structure of the sample matrix, and samples are classified according to the class membership, with discriminant analysis and support vector machines performing complementarily on a training and on a test set...|$|R

Beside the obvious problems related to correct dimensions, there is the problem of achieving the correct finish or surface smoothness on the workpiece.
