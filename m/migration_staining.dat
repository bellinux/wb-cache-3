40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} a ruthenium complex ((bis(2, 2 '-bipyridine) - 4 '-methyl- 4 -carboxybipyridine-ruthenium-N-succidimyl ester-bis(hexafluorophosphate), abbreviated below as ASCQ_Ru) commercially available and chemically pure. This new ruthenium complex ASCQ_Ru brings an activated ester, allowing the selective acylation of amino acid side chain amines for the post <b>migration</b> <b>staining</b> of proteins separated in 1 -DE and 2 -DE. The protocol used is a simple three-step protocol fixing the proteins in the gel, staining and then washing, as no lengthy destaining step is required. First the critical staining step was optimized. Although in solution the best described pH for acylating proteins with this reagent is phosphate buffer at pH 7. 0, we found that best medium for in-gel staining is unbuffered ACN/water solution (20 / 80 v/v). The two other steps are less critical and classical conditions are satisfactory: fixing with 7 % acetic acid/ 10 % ethanol solution and washing four times for 10 min with water. Sensitivity tests were performed using 1 -DE on protein molecular weight markers. We obtained a higher sensitivity than SYPRO Ruby with a detection limit of 80 pg of protein per well. However, contrary to SYPRO Ruby, ASCQ_Ru exhibits a logarithmic dependency on the amount of protein. The dynamic range is similar to SYPRO Ruby and is estimated between three and four orders of magnitude. Finally, the efficiency of the post migration ASCQ_Ru staining for 2 -D gel separation is demonstrated on the whole protein extract from human colon carcinoma cells lines HCT 116. ASCQ_Ru gave the highest number of spot detected compared to other common stains Colloidal CBB, SYPRO Ruby and Deep Purple. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Fish esterases {{are among}} the most {{difficult}} enzymes to identify using starch gel electrophoresis because of the many loci that are simultaneously active, and especially because of duplication phenomena, satellite bands, and stain trails. In an attempt to simplify and clarify electropherograms, various staining and inhibitory methods were tested on esterases from the flounder #Platichthys flesus$. A range of <b>migration</b> and <b>staining</b> buffers and substrates were used, as well as chemical inhibition and heat inactivation. A combination of the methods made it possible to distinguish and characterize the five presumed esterase loci. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Controlled {{renewal of}} the {{epithelium}} with precise cell distribution and gene expression patterns is essential for colonic function. GATA 6 is expressed in the colonic epithelium, but its function in the colon is currently unknown. To define GATA 6 function in the colon, we conditionally deleted Gata 6 throughout the epithelium of small and large intestines of adult mice. In the colon, Gata 6 deletion resulted in shorter, wider crypts, a decrease in proliferation, and a delayed crypt-to-surface epithelial <b>migration</b> rate. <b>Staining</b> techniques and electron microscopy indicated deficient maturation of goblet cells, and coimmunofluorescence demonstrated alterations in specific hormones produced by the endocrine L cells and serotonin-producing cells. Specific colonocyte genes were significantly downregulated. In LS 174 T, the colonic adenocarcinoma cell line, Gata 6 knockdown resulted in a significant downregulation of a similar subset of goblet cell and colonocyte genes, and GATA 6 was found to occupy active loci in enhancers and promoters {{of some of these}} genes, suggesting that they are direct targets of GATA 6. These data demonstrate that GATA 6 is necessary for proliferation, migration, lineage maturation, and gene expression in the mature colonic epitheliu...|$|R

However, there is limited understanding of the role of STAT 3 in modulating other aspects of tumorigenesis such as angiogenesis. In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of STAT 3 decoy oligonucleotide on tumor angiogenesis. Experimental Design: A STAT 3 decoy oligonucleotide and small interfering RNA (siRNA) were used to inhibit STAT 3 in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. The biochemical effects of STAT 3 inhibition were examined in conjunction with the consequences on proliferation, <b>migration,</b> apoptotic <b>staining,</b> and tubule formation. Additionally, we assessed the effects of STAT 3 inhibition on tumor angiogenesis using murine xenograft models. Results: STAT 3 decoy oligonucleotide decreased proliferation, induces apoptosis, decreased migration, and decreased tubule formation of endothelial cells in vitro. The STAT 3 decoy oligonucleotide also inhibited tumor angiogenesis in murine tumor xenografts. Lastly, our data suggest that the antiangiogenic effects of STAT 3 decoy oligonucleotide were mediatedthrough the inhibition of both STAT 3 and STAT 1.

40|$|The NUP 1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes {{one member}} {{of a family of}} nuclear pore complex {{proteins}} (nucleoporins) conserved from yeast to vertebrates. We have used mutational analysis to investigate the function of Nup 1 p.

Amino-terminal truncation causes mislocalization and degradation of the mutant protein, suggesting that this domain is required for targeting Nup 1 p to the nuclear pore complex. Carboxy-terminal mutants are stable but do not have wild-type function, and confer a temperature sensitive phenotype.

Observations: We report our findings in a 31 -year-old woman with an idiopathic recurrent branch retinal arterial occlusions (BRAOs) who was followed in our clinic for 16 years. Repeated fluorescein angiographies were performed to evaluate the idiopathic recurrent BRAOs. The findings showed multiple segmental arteriolar staining in the fundus. These staining were found at locations with and without branch retinal arterial occlusions. Repeated fluorescein angiography showed that these staining migrated toward the periphery. The speed of the <b>migration</b> of the <b>staining</b> was about 0. 64  ±  0. 22 mm/day with a range of 0. 43 – 0. 85 mm/day in the posterior pole of the eye.

40|$|Suitable electrophoretic {{separation}} {{methods of}} 34 isozymes from 17 enzyme systems resolved in Phaseolus lunatus L. (Lima bean) were developed. Data from the <b>migration</b> of the <b>staining</b> zones indicated that three loci control EST, GPI, IDH and MDH expression, while two loci control ACO, ADH, DIA, G 6 PDH, PER, PGDH, and PGM expression. The {{difference between the}} stained zones intensity on gels assayed for GDH and SOD suggest {{that each of these}} enzymes is also controlled by two loci. A single locus controls END, beta-GLU, LAP and SKDH. Based on the observed isozyme banding patterns, we inferred the quaternary structure of 11 enzyme systems. DIA isozymes were identified as tetrameric, ADH, fEST, GPI, MDH and PGDH as dimeric, and ACO, cEST, END, G 6 PDH, PGM and SKDH as monomeric.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} significance of different Treg attracting chemokine intratumoral expressions in breast and ovarian cancer patients with available long-term follow-up (15 years). We investigated the prespecified {{hypothesis that the}} expression of Treg specific chemokines in cancer tissue predicts the OS. Patients and Methods: We screened all so far known chemokines of the CC-family for their capacity to selectively attract Treg in vitro. Three chemokines (CCL 1, CCL 22, and CCL 27) with selective action on Treg <b>migration</b> were <b>stained</b> using extensively characterized antibodieAntibodys. The numbers of positive cells in tissue microarray cores from ovarian cancer and invasive breast cancer were computer-aided determined. Results: Within all analyzed chemokines, only CCL 1, CCL 22 and CCL 27 selectively attracted Treg in vitro. All three chemokines were strongly expressed in most ovarian and breast cancer tissues. Moreover, {{there was a significant}} relationship between Treg infiltration in tumors and CCL 1 - and CCL 27 -expressing cell total numbers, whereas no association was seen for CCL 22. High numbers of CCL 1 - or CCL 27 -positive cells identified patients with shorter OS. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that quantification of intratumoral Treg attracting chemokines in ovarian and breast cancer is valuable for assessing disease prognosis. Unlike conventional clinicopathologic factors, high expression of certain chemokines can identify patients at risk of death over 15 years. CCL 1 and CCL 27 represent novel markers for identifying effect of immune response and tumor escape as well as patients who may benefit from immunotherapy. Such chemokines may gain to be considered together and could represent important therapeutic targets...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cells of melanocytic naevi and {{cutaneous}} malignant melanomas (MM) {{are surrounded}} by a basement membrane (BM). AIM: To scrutinize any difference between the deposits of alpha 1 (IV) and alpha 5 (IV) collagen chains in melanocytic naevi and MM. METHODS: A total of 27 common melanocytic naevi, 11 dysplastic naevi, 21 atypical naevi (melanocytomas) including Spitz and non-Spitz types, as well as 24 MM were studied. Their phenotypic and functional characteristics defined by immunohistochemistry using a panel of antibodies, including those directed to the alpha 1 (IV), alpha 3 (IV) and alpha 5 (IV) collagen chains. RESULTS: Almost all naevi and half the melanocytomas exhibited a strong positivity for the alpha 1 (IV) collagen chain. By contrast, the remaining melanocytomas and MM presented a heterogeneous staining pattern for the alpha 1 (IV) collagen chain. One third of the naevi, 23 % of the MM without cutaneous micrometastasis and 83 % of MM with cutaneous micrometastasis showed discrete cytoplasmic positivity for the alpha 5 (IV) collagen chain. All other melanocytic tumours were negative for this antibody. Rare MM cells in transepidermal <b>migration</b> were <b>stained</b> with the anti-alpha 1 (IV) or alpha 5 (IV) collagen chain antibodies. No immunoreactivity for the alpha 3 (IV) collagen chain was disclosed {{in any of the}} samples. CONCLUSION: We report the expression of alpha 1 (IV) and alpha 5 (IV) collagen chains in naevi and MM. The inconsistent staining pattern for alpha 1 (IV) collagen chain in phenotypically atypical melanocytomas and in MM highlight the heterogeneity in both cell differentiation and stroma-tumour interactions. This biological aspect may be related to neoplastic progression and influence metastatic potential. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} identified prenylated Rab acceptor 1 (PRA 1) as a novel cellular interacting partner for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded oncoprotein, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP 1). The intracellular trafficking and full signaling of LMP 1 requires its interaction with PRA 1. To further explore {{the role of}} PRA 1 in Epstein-Barr virus-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells, we generated several PRA 1 -knockdown cell clones, which exhibited altered cell morphology and increased cell motility. We identified proteins differentially expressed in the knockdown clones by means of isobaric mass tags labeling coupled with multidimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We validated a panel of proteins, which showed consistent up-regulation in PRA 1 -knockdown clones and participated in regulating lipid homeostasis and cell <b>migration.</b> Immunofluorescence <b>staining</b> further revealed altered localization of these proteins and accumulation of intracellular cholesterol in PRA 1 -knockdown clones. These effects were phenocopied by treatment with a cholesterol transport inhibitor, U 18666 A. Moreover, overexpressed PRA 1 was able to alleviate the dysregulation of these affected proteins either from PRA 1 knockdown or U 18666 A treatment, implying a role for PRA 1 in regulating the levels of these affected proteins in response to altered cholesterol homeostasis. We further demonstrated that LMP 1 expression caused PRA 1 sequestration in NPC cells, leading to a consequence reminiscent of PRA 1 knockdown. Finally, the immunohistochemistry showed a physiological relevance of the PRA 1 -associated proteome-wide changes in NPC biopsy tissues. In sum, our findings delineated novel roles of PRA 1 in lipid transport and cell migration, and provided additional insights into the molecular basis of NPC morphogenesis, namely a consequence of LMP 1 -PRA 1 interaction...|$|R

40|$|Blood flow {{influences}} atherosclerosis by generating wall shear stress, which alters {{endothelial cell}} (EC) physiology. Low shear stress induces dedifferentiation of EC {{through a process}} termed endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). The mechanism underlying shear stress-regulation of EndoMT is uncertain. Here we investigated {{the role of the}} transcription factor Snail in low shear stress-induced EndoMT. Studies of cultured EC exposed to flow revealed that low shear stress induced Snail expression. Using gene silencing it was demonstrated that Snail positively regulated the expression of EndoMT markers (Slug, N-cadherin, aSMA) in EC exposed to low shear stress. Gene silencing also revealed that Snail enhanced the permeability of endothelial monolayers to macromolecules by promoting EC proliferation and <b>migration.</b> En face <b>staining</b> of the murine aorta or carotid arteries modified with flow-altering cuffs demonstrated that Snail was expressed preferentially at low shear stress sites that are predisposed to atherosclerosis. Snail was also expressed in EC overlying atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries from patients with ischemic heart disease implying a role in human arterial disease. We conclude that Snail is an essential driver of EndoMT under low shear stress conditions and may promote early atherogenesis by enhancing vascular permeability...|$|R

N-CAM was present at all times in all layers. However, the large cytoplasmic domain polypeptide of N-CAM was always absent from the external granular layer and was enriched in the molecular layer as development proceeded. Ng-CAM began to be expressed in the premigratory granule cells just before migration and later disappeared from cell bodies but remained on parallel fibers. Cytotactin, which is synthesized by glia and not by neurons, appeared first in a speckled pattern within the external granular layer and later appeared in a continuous pattern along the Bergmann glia; it was also enriched in the molecular layer. After we established their order of appearance, we tested the separate functions of these adhesion molecules in granule cell migration by adding specific antibodies against each molecule to cerebellar explant cultures that had been labeled with tritiated thymidine and then measuring the differential distribution of labeled cells in the forming layers. Anti-N-CAM showed marginal effects. In contrast, anti-Ng-CAM arrested most cells in the external granular layer, while anti-cytotactin arrested most cells in the molecular layer. Time course analyses combined with sequential addition of different antibodies in different orders showed that anti- Ng-CAM had a major effect in the early period (first 36 h in culture) and a lesser effect {{in the second part of}} the culture period, while anti-cytotactin had essentially no effect at the earlier time but had major effects at a later period (18 - 72 h in culture). The two major stages of cerebellar granule cell migration thus appear to be differentially affected by distinct adhesion molecules of different cellular origins, binding mechanisms, and overall distributions. The results indicated that local cell surface modulation of adhesion molecules of different specificities at defined stages and sites is essential to the formation of cerebellar cortical layers...|$|R

However, those patients suffering from metastatic and recurrent ES still have only poor chances of survival and require new therapeutic approaches. Interleukin- 6 (IL 6) is a pleiotropic cytokine expressed by immune cells and a great variety of cancer cells. It induces inflammatory responses, enhances proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in cancer cells, thereby promoting chemoresistance. METHODS: We investigated expression of IL 6, its receptors and the IL 6 signal transduction pathway in ES tumor samples and cell lines applying reverse transcriptase PCR, immunoblot and immunohistochemistry. The impact of IL 6 on cell viability and apoptosis in ES cell lines was analyzed by MTT and propidium iodide <b>staining,</b> <b>migration</b> assessed by chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry proved IL 6 expression in the stroma of ES tumor samples. IL 6 receptor subunits IL 6 R and IL 6 ST were expressed on the surface of ES cells. Treatment of ES cells with rhIL 6 resulted in phosphorylation of STAT 3. rhIL 6 protected ES cells from serum starvation-induced apoptosis and promoted migration. IL 6 blood serum levels were elevated in a subgroup of ES patients with poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that IL 6 contributes to ES tumor progression by increasing resistance to apoptosis in conditions of cellular stress, such as serum starvation, and by promotion of metastasis...|$|R
40|$|Heat-stable factors {{released}} by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in culture supernatants inhibit functional cilia of rabbit tracheal epithelium. Chloroform extraction removed heat-stable factors from stationary-phase culture supernatants. The extracts contained {{at least seven}} components separable by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Cilioinhibitory components were identified as a phenazine derivative, pyo compounds (2 -alkyl- 4 -hydroxyquinolines), and a rhamnolipid, {{also known as a}} hemolysin. Fluorescence and absorption spectra, relative <b>migration</b> on TLC, <b>staining</b> characteristics, and gas chromatography were the basis for identification. Inhibitory concentrations of each active component were established by quantitative measures of percent motility and beat frequency. Corresponding damage to ciliary ultrastructure was examined by electron microscopy. The pyo compounds produced ciliostasis at concentrations of 50 micrograms/ml, but without obvious ultrastructural lesions. The phenazine derivative also inhibited ciliary motility and caused some membrane disruption, although at substantially greater concentrations of 400 micrograms/ml. Limited exposure of tracheal explants to the rhamnolipid resulted in ciliostasis which was associated with altered ciliary membranes. More extensive exposure to rhamnolipid was associated with removal of dynein arms from axonemes. Pyocyanin at a concentration of 0. 5 mg/ml did not inhibit ciliary beating under our conditions. The data suggest that the pyo compounds are the most effective per weight ciliostatic factors {{released by}} P. aeruginosa and rhamnolipid is the most destructive of cilia ultrastructure. By interfering with normal ciliary function, these ciliostatic factors may enable P. aeruginosa to more easily colonize the respiratory tract...|$|R

Quantitative and qualitative stool cultures on selective media of the treated animals revealed only growth of yeast organisms. The treated animals developed enlargement of the ceca with fluid contents and watery stools, resembling characteristics of germfree animals. Radioautography with tritiated thymidine revealed an increased epithelial cell migration rate in the mice treated with the antibiotics for 3 to 5 wk. A slight increase in villus height was also noted. The treated male mice showed greater variance than the treated females in epithelial cell <b>migration</b> rates. Histochemical <b>staining</b> reactions showed a decrease in nonspecific esterase and in NADH dehydrogenase activity in the proximal gut of the antibiotic animals. Stains of distal gut and those for acid and alkaline phosphatase, NADPH dehydrogenase, lactic dehydrogenase, and succinic dehydrogenase were similar to the controls. A slight increase in sucrase activity and a slight decrease in lactase activity in the antibiotic animals was observed in contrast to control animals. Germfree mice, however, had greater sucrase and lactase activity. Transport of L-methionine was slightly reduced in the distal segment of the treated animals. Since the direction of these changes is away from the intestinal state observed in germfree animals, they {{are probably the result}} of the direct action of the antibiotics on the gut...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the influence of the different e-smoking liquids on the viability and proliferation of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts. Method and materials: For this study six test solutions with components from ECs were selected: lime-, hazelnut- and menthol-flavored liquids, nicotine, propylene glycol, and PBS as control group. The fibroblasts were incubated up to 96 h with the different liquids, and cell viability was measured by using the PrestoBlue® reagent, the ATP detection and the <b>migration</b> assay. Fluorescence <b>staining</b> was carried out to visualize cell growth and morphology. Data were statistically analyzed by two-tailed one-way ANOVA. Results: The cell viability assay showed that the proliferation rates of the cells incubated with nicotine or the various flavored liquids of the e-cigarettes were reduced in comparison to the controls, though not all reductions were statistically significant. After an incubation of 96 h with the menthol-flavored liquid the fibroblasts were statistically significant reduced (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Similar results were found for the detection of ATP in fibroblasts; the incubation with menthol-flavored liquids (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) led to a statistically significant reduction. The cell visualization tests confirmed these findings. Conclusion: Within its limits, the present in vitro study demonstrated that menthol additives of e-smoking have a harmful effect on human periodontal ligament fibroblasts. This might indicate that menthol additives should be avoided for e-cigarettes...|$|R

In earlier studies, we demonstrated increased insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF- 1) is associated with breast tumor formation and poor clinical outcomes. In our current study we have investigated IGF- 1 regulation of Cyr 61 and whether targeting IGF- 1 could inhibit Cyr 61 induced tumor growth and proliferation. Methods: Several ATCC derived normal and breast cancer cell lines were used in this study: MDA-MB 231, BT 474, MCF- 7, and SKBR 3. We also tested cells stably transfected in our laboratory with active Akt 1 (pAkt; SKBR 3 /AA and MCF- 7 /AA) and dominant negative Akt 1 (SKBR 3 /DN and MCF- 7 /DN). In addition, we used MCF- 7 cells transfected with full length Cyr 61 (CYA). Monolayer cultures treated with IGF- 1 were analyzed for Cyr 61 expression by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical <b>staining.</b> <b>Migration</b> assays and MTT based proliferation assays were used to determine invasive characteristics in response to IGF- 1 /Cyr 61 activation. Results: Cells with activated Akt have increased levels of Cyr 61. Conversely, cells with inactive Akt have decreased levels of Cyr 61. IGF- 1 treatment increased Cyr 61 expression significantly and cells with high level of Cyr 61 demonstrate increased invasiveness and proliferation. Cyr 61 overexpression and activation led to decrease in E-cadherin and decrease in FOXO 1. Inhibition of the PI 3 K and MAPK pathways resulted in significant decrease in invasiveness and proliferation, most notably i...|$|R
40|$|Mid-gestation fetal {{cutaneous}} wounds heal scarlessly {{and this}} has been attributed in part to abundant hyaluronan (HA) in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and a unique fibroblast phenotype. We recently reported a novel role for interleukin 10 (IL- 10) as a regulator of HA synthesis in the fetal ECM, as well as the ability of the fetal fibroblast to produce an HA-rich pericellular matrix (PCM). We hypothesized that IL- 10 -mediated HA synthesis was essential to the fetal fibroblast functional phenotype and, moreover, that this phenotype could be recapitulated in adult fibroblasts via supplementation with IL- 10 via an HA dependent process. To evaluate the differences in functional profile, we compared metabolism (MTS assay), apoptosis (caspase- 3 <b>staining),</b> <b>migration</b> (scratch wound assay) and invasion (transwell assay) between C 57 Bl/ 6 J murine fetal (E 14. 5) and adult (8 weeks) fibroblasts. We found that fetal fibroblasts have lower rates of metabolism and apoptosis, and an increased ability to migrate and invade compared to adult fibroblasts, and that these effects were dependent on IL- 10 and HA synthase activity. Further, addition of IL- 10 to adult fibroblasts resulted in increased fibroblast migration and invasion and recapitulated the fetal phenotype in an HA-dependent manner. Our data demonstrates the functional differences between fetal and adult fibroblasts, and that IL- 10 mediated HA synthesis is essential for the fetal fibroblasts' enhanced invasion and migration properties. Moreover, IL- 10 via an HA-dependent mechanism can recapitulate this aspect of the fetal phenotype in adult fibroblasts, suggesting a novel mechanism of IL- 10 in regenerative wound healing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Patients {{with chronic}} kidney disease (CKD) {{are at high risk}} of {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD). Endothelial progenitor cell (EPCs) dysfunction {{plays a key role in}} this pathogenesis. Uremic retention toxins have been reported to be in associated with EPC dysfunction. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) free adducts, including Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) and Nepsilon-(carboxyethyl) lysine (CEL), are formed by physiological proteolysis of AGEs and released into plasma for urinary excretion. They are retained in CKD patients and are considered to be potential uremic toxins. Though AGEs have been demonstrated to impair EPC function in various ways, the effect of AGE free adducts on EPC function has not been studied. Thus, we examined the role of CML and CEL in the regulation of growth-factor-dependent function in cultured human EPCs and the mechanisms by which they may affect EPC function. Methods Late outgrowth EPCs were incubated with different concentrations of CML or CEL for up to 72 hours. Cell proliferation was determined using WST- 1 and BrdU assays. Cell apoptosis was tested with annexin V <b>staining.</b> <b>Migration</b> and tube formation assays were used to evaluate EPC function. Results Though CML and CEL were determined to have anti-proliferative effects on EPCs, cells treated with concentrations of CML and CEL in the range found in CKD patients had no observable impairment on migration or tube formation. CML and CEL did not induce EPC apoptosis. The reduced growth response was accompanied by significantly less phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Conclusions Our study revealed that CML and CEL at uremic concentrations have low biological toxicity when separately tested. The biologic effects of AGE free adducts on the cardiovascular system merit further study. </p...|$|R

It is unknown whether these changes also occur in other preplacental vessels (radial and arcuate arteries) in normal pregnancies.

The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the extent of trophoblast invasion in the guinea-pig preplacental vasculature and its effect on the vascular structure of mesometrial, myometrial and arcade arteries. Under general anaesthesia the vascular system of non- (n = 4), mid- (n = 4) and late- (n = 8) pregnant guinea-pigs was fixed by immersion or perfusion. Cross-sections of immersion-fixed mesometrial and arcade arteries were stained with toluidine blue. Cross-sections of perfusion-fixed mesometrial, myometrial and arcade arteries were stained with haematoxylin-eosin, Elastica van Gieson staining and antibodies against alpha-smooth-muscle-actin (ASMA), cytokeratin and factor VIII, to detect vascular smooth muscle, trophoblastic, and endothelial cells, respectively. In addition, the external and internal vascular circumference of sections from perfusion-fixed tissue was determined. All cross-sections were evaluated by light microscopy. In the course of pregnancy, progressive endothelial swelling, disappearance of the elastic lamina interna and disarrangement of the tunica media were observed in the myometrial and throughout the mesometrial arteries up to the junction with the arcade arteries. These changes coincided the <b>migration</b> of keratin-positive <b>staining</b> giant cells. It is concluded that in normal guinea-pig pregnancy, structural changes occur in the entire mesometrial artery and at least a part of the myometrial artery, although such changes were not seen in the arcade arter...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Epithelial cell {{migration}} {{is required for}} regeneration of tissues and can be defective {{in a number of}} ocular surface diseases. This study aimed to determine the expression pattern of Rho family small G-proteins in human corneal epithelial cells to test their requirement in directional {{cell migration}}. METHODS: Rho family small G-protein expression was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Dominant-inhibitory constructs encoding Rho proteins or Rho protein targeting small interfering RNA were transfected into human corneal epithelial large T antigen cells, and wound closure rate were evaluated by scratch wounding assay, and a complementary non-traumatic cell <b>migration</b> assay. Immunofluorescence <b>staining</b> was performed to study cell polarization and to assess Cdc 42 downstream effector. RESULTS: Cdc 42, Chp, Rac 1, RhoA, TC 10 and TCL were expressed in human corneal epithelial cells. Among them, Cdc 42 and TCL were found to significantly affect cell migration in monolayer scratch assays. These results were confirmed through the use of validated siRNAs directed to Cdc 42 and TCL. Scramble siRNA transfected cells had high percentage of polarized cells than Cdc 42 or TCL siRNA transfected cells at the wound edge. We showed that the Cdc 42 -specific effector p 21 -activated kinase 4 localized predominantly to cell-cell junctions in cell monolayers, but failed to translocate to the leading edge in Cdc 42 siRNA transfected cells after monolayer wounding. CONCLUSION: Rho proteins expressed in cultured human corneal epithelial cells, and Cdc 42, TCL facilitate two-dimensional cell migration in-vitro. Although silencing of Cdc 42 and TCL did not noticeably affect the appearance of cell adhesions at the leading edge, the slower migration of these cells indicates both GTP-binding proteins play important roles in promoting cell movement of human corneal epithelial cells...|$|R
40|$|Background: Expression of {{chemotactic}} {{molecules in}} the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment may deeply influence NK cell maturation by controlling their positioning into specific niches. In the present study, we functionally characterized CX 3 CR 1 expressing NK cell subsets. Methods: CX 3 CR 1 expression was assessed by FACS analysis and the functions of NK cells by <b>migration,</b> IFN-gamma intracellular <b>staining</b> and citotoxicity assays. Results: Using CX 3 CR 1 +/GFP mice, we showed that CX 3 CR 1 is prevalently expressed by the KLRG 1 + NK cell subset that is considered a quiescent and terminally differentiated NK cell population with reduced effector functions. Within KLRG 1 + NK cells, CX 3 CR 1 + cells evidenced reduced CXCR 4 expression and function that was associated with different positioning within BM {{as compared to the}} CX 3 CR 1 - NK cells. In addition, CX 3 CR 1 + NK cells displayed impaired capability to produce IFN-gamma and to lyse YAC- 1 target cells. By means of adoptive transfer experiments we observed that CX 3 CR 1 expression can be acquired by KLRG 1 +/CX 3 CR 1 - NK cells, while KLRG 1 +/CX 3 CR 1 + NK cells stably expressed CX 3 CR 1. We also analyzed the role of CX 3 CR 1 during NK cell maturation, comparing NK cell tissue distribution in heterozygous CX 3 CR 1 +/GFP and in CX 3 CR 1 -deficient CX 3 CR 1 GFP/GFP mice. We observed tissue accumulation of GFP+ NK cells in CX 3 CR 1 GFP/GFP mice that was associated to anincreased number of BM NK cells during steady state and to a defective BM NK cell mobilization during POLY I:C –induced inflammation. Conclusions: All together, our findings show that CX 3 CR 1 is a marker of a KLRG 1 + NK cell subset with impaired effector functions that can irreversibly differentiate from the CX 3 CR 1 - cells under steady state conditions...|$|R

In earlier studies, we demonstrated increased insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF- 1) is associated with breast tumor formation and poor clinical outcomes. In our current study we have investigated IGF- 1 regulation of Cyr 61 and whether targeting IGF- 1 could inhibit Cyr 61 induced tumor growth and proliferation. Several ATCC derived normal and breast cancer cell lines were used in this study: MDA-MB 231, BT 474, MCF- 7, and SKBR 3. We also tested cells stably transfected in our laboratory with active Akt 1 (pAkt; SKBR 3 /AA and MCF- 7 /AA) and dominant negative Akt 1 (SKBR 3 /DN and MCF- 7 /DN). In addition, we used MCF- 7 cells transfected with full length Cyr 61 (CYA). Monolayer cultures treated with IGF- 1 were analyzed for Cyr 61 expression by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical <b>staining.</b> <b>Migration</b> assays and MTT based proliferation assays were used to determine invasive characteristics in response to IGF- 1 /Cyr 61 activation. Cells with activated Akt have increased levels of Cyr 61. Conversely, cells with inactive Akt have decreased levels of Cyr 61. IGF- 1 treatment increased Cyr 61 expression significantly and cells with high level of Cyr 61 demonstrate increased invasiveness and proliferation. Cyr 61 overexpression and activation led to decrease in E-cadherin and decrease in FOXO 1. Inhibition of the PI 3 K and MAPK pathways resulted in significant decrease in invasiveness and proliferation, most notably in the PI 3 K pathway inhibited cells. The findings of this study show that IGF- 1 upregulates Cyr 61 primarily through activation of the Akt-PI 3 K pathway. IGF- 1 induced MAPK plays a partial role. Increase in Cyr 61 leads to increase in breast cancer cell growth and invasion. Hence, targeting Cyr 61 and associated pathways may offer an opportunity to inhibit IGF- 1 mediated Cyr 61 induced breast cancer growth and invasion...|$|R
40|$|The unc- 53 gene is {{required}} for the guidance and extension of a subset of cells along the anterior-posterior axis of Caenorhabditis elegans, including several neurons, the sex muscles and the excretory canals. Immunofluorescence of adult hermaphrodites with antisera raised against the calponin homology (CH) domain in the amino terminus of UNC- 53 stains the excretory canals, vulva and coelomocytes, suggesting that the full length UNC- 53 protein {{is required}} in these cells after <b>migration</b> and outgrowth. <b>Staining</b> in n 152 and n 166 mutants indicates that these animals express truncated UNC- 53 products. In order to identify proteins that interact with UNC- 53, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted. Using the N-terminal CH domain as 2 ̆ 7 bait 2 ̆ 7 and a C. elegans cDNA library as 2 ̆ 7 prey 2 ̆ 7, 18 strong candidate interactors were identified. Seven of these correspond to the C. elegans genomic locus B 0336. 6, which encodes a SH 3 containing protein suggesting a role in signal transduction. The SH 3 domain of the Drosophila homologue, Abi, binds to the polyproline motif of Abelson tyrosine kinase and the yeast homologue, Ysc 84 p, is thought to couple the actin cytoskeleton to the endocytic machinery. Four candidate cDNAs encode C. elegans REF(2) P like protein that contains a zinc finger motif of the ZZ type found in the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin, and a ubiquitin associated domain. The yeast homologue, verprolin, is an actin binding protein that presumably modulates polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. The yeast protein interaction database identified yeast verprolid/C. elegans T 12 G 3. 1 and yeast Ysc 84 p/Drosophila Abi/C. elegans B 0336. 6 as interactors with yeast Sla 1 p, a multifunctional protein that couples the yeast endocytic machinery to proteins regulating actin dynamics. These data suggest that UNC- 53, together with verprolin/T 12 G 3. 1, Ysc 84 p/Abi/B 0336. 6 and Slalp may form a complex at the cytoskeleton that stabilizes or promotes actin polymerization. The remaining 7 candidates define molecules with diverse cellular activities. Interestingly, none of the candidate UNC- 53 interactors have been discovered in previous genetic screens aimed at identifying genes involved in cell migration and outgrowth...|$|R
40|$|Topoisomerase I generates {{transient}} single-stranded {{breaks in}} DNA {{and have the}} capacity to fragment the genome. Thus, this enzyme is the target for some of the most successful anticancer drugs. Ethoxidine, a benzo[c]phenanthridines derivative, was identified as a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I. As angiogenesis is a critical step in tumorigenesis, {{this study was designed to}} test the potential effect of ethoxidine on different processes leading to neovascularisation on EaHy endothelial cells including adhesion, migration and proliferation. Ethoxidine was tested at two concentrations, 100 μM and 10 μM. VEGF (20 ng/mL) was used as control. Adherent cells were evaluated using crystal violet <b>staining,</b> <b>migration</b> using a model of wound healing. Proliferation was analyzed using CyQUANT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit. Both O 2 - and NO productions were assessed using electronic paramagnetic resonance technique. All the effects of ethoxidine were evaluated at 24 h treatment. Low concentration of ethoxidine promoted migration to the same extent as that produced by VEGF whereas high concentration inhibited this process. Ethoxidine significantly enhanced adhesion at similar level than VEGF at low concentration. It was without effect at high concentration. Although ethoxidine had no effect at low concentration, it significantly reduced cell proliferation at high concentration. At any concentration tested, ethoxidine did not modify basal O 2 - production. Interestingly, ethoxidine significantly increase NO production at low concentration but it was without effect at high concentration. As control experiment, VEGF enhanced Eahy cells NO production under the same experimental conditions. Altogether, the present study highlights paradoxical effects of ethoxidine depending on the concentration used. At low concentration, it promotes both Eahy cells migration and adhesion without any effect on proliferation. Importantly, these effects were associated with an increase of NO production. In contrast at high concentration, ethoxidine reduced Eahy cells migration and proliferation but had no effect neither on adhesion nor NO release. Of note is the fact that ethoxidine did not alter endothelial cells oxidative stress at any concentration tested. Thus, these data underscore the potential anti-tumoral property of ethoxidine at high concentration and endothelial cells in the present study. The property of ethoxidine in inhibiting proliferation in both cell type probably account for its high antitumor activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the effects of IL- 6 on endothelial cells and to investigate the role of IL- 6 in the angiogenesis of ovarian carcinomas. We evaluated human ovarian carcinoma clinical specimens and determined that high expression of IL- 6 was associated with increased tumor vascularization. Additionally, endothelial cells derived from the ovary and mesentery expressed the IL- 6 receptor (IL- 6 R), and their stimulation with the exogenous ligand activated downstream signaling molecules and enhanced cell <b>migration.</b> Dual immunohistochemical <b>staining</b> for CD- 31 and IL- 6 R revealed IL- 6 R expression on human endothelial cells within normal ovary and ovarian carcinomas. To further investigate the possible proangiogenic function of IL- 6, Gelfoam sponges containing IL- 6 or bFGF were implanted into the subcutis of BALB/c mice. IL- 6 containing sponges were vascularized to the same extent as bFGF containing sponges. ^ Chronic stress can adversely affect disease progression. Stimulation of ovarian carcinoma cell lines with concentrations of catecholamines achieved in individuals experiencing chronic stress resulted in a substantial increase in IL- 6 production. It was determined that stress mediators regulate IL- 6 expression through the β-adrenergic receptor and Src. These data illustrate one mechanism by which chronic stress may influence tumor progression. ^ To investigate whether IL- 6 contributes to the angiogenesis of ovarian carcinomas, we isolated low IL- 6 expressing clones from the SKOV 3. ip 1 cell line and transfected them with a plasmid encoding the IL- 6 gene. We observed no difference in tumor weight between high and low IL- 6 expressing cells. However, while low IL- 6 expressing tumors were highly vascularized, high IL- 6 expressing tumors appeared hypervascularized. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that all tumors exhibited robust expression of additional proangiogenic molecules. ^ Collectively, these studies indicate that IL- 6 secreted by ovarian cancer cells is a highly proangiogenic cytokine. However, IL- 6 is but one of several proangiogenic molecules produced by ovarian cancer, and its inhibition may not be sufficient to inhibit angiogenesis of ovarian carcinoma. The findings presented in this dissertation provide insight into the function of IL- 6 as a regulator of angiogenesis. Understanding of the role of proangiogenic molecules such as IL- 6 in ovarian carcinoma may have important implications for therapy directed at the vascular component of this disease. ...|$|R

40|$|Poster presentation: {{abstract}} no. 3105 OBJECTIVES: Triple negative {{breast cancer}} (TNBC) {{is defined by}} lack of expression in estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2), which accounts for 10 - 15 % of all breast cancers. TNBC is a more aggressive histological subtype with worse prognosis {{when compared to other}} subtypes due to limited therapeutic targets for hormonal and HER 2 receptors. With limited treatment options and ineffective targeted therapy, there is an urgent need for the development of novel therapeutic targets to treat this malignant form of breast cancer. METHODS: Focused on the previously identified TNBC biomarker miR- 199 a- 5 p by our group, cells were transfected with 199 a- 5 p mimic for functional studies. MTT and wound healing assay were performed to investigate the cell proliferation and <b>migration</b> ability. Immunofluorescence <b>staining</b> was introduced to study TWIST 1 and E-cadherin expression in miR 199 a- 5 p stable transfected cells. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) expression level was compared between breast cancers and normal control cases’ plasma by using real-time RT-PCR. We further used ALDH activity assay to evaluate the stem cell population. In vivo study was also carried out in nude mice to study tumorigenicity. RESULTS: Cell proliferation assay showed that overexpression of miR- 199 a- 5 p significantly inhibited cell growth (p = 0. 0008). Wound healing assay indicated the ectopic expression of miR- 199 a- 5 p can inhibit cell migration compared to control group. In miR- 199 a- 5 p stable transfected MDA-MB- 231 cell line, increased translocation of Twist 1 protein from nucleus to cytoplasm and increased expression of E-cadherin was detected by immunofluorescence staining. ALDH activity assay result indicated that the proportion of ALDH(BR+) cells decreased significantly from 17. 21 % to 8. 95 % in the miR- 199 a- 5 p transfected cells when compared to the control group (p = 0. 0279). Consistent with in vitro study, the well-recognized breast cancer stem-cell marker, ALDH 1 A, was significantly upregulated in the plasma of breast cancer patients than in healthy controls. Moreover, in vivo study also revealed that stable MDA-MB- 231 cell line with ectopic miR 199 a- 5 p expression resulted in smaller volume of tumors in nude mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data implicate that miR- 199 a- 5 p plays a tumor suppressive role in the pathogenesis of TNBC, which may due to the inhibition of stemness characteristics in breast cancer cells. These findings suggest that miR- 199 a- 5 p involved in TNBC stemness-related features and thus provide insights in development of the novel therapeutic strategies for this highly malignant breast cancer. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|During Trichinella spiralis {{infection}} host {{defense is}} based on eosinophilia and increased IgE levels, as observed in Th 2 mediated diseases like asthma and allergic rhinitis. Nowadays allergic diseases are treated with an alternative approach to the usual immunesuppressive method, using the mutual antagonism between Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines. For this reason the research has investigated new Th 1 adjuvant molecules able to contrast the exacerbated Th 2 responses to allergens. In particular among a large panel of pro-Th 1 adjuvants, the protein of bacterial origin Helicobacter pylori neutrophil activating protein (HP-NAP) can induce immunity cells to activate towards a Th 1 phenotype, also acting in vitro on Th 2 polarized cells. The aim of the present PhD thesis was to verify the immunological efficacy of HP-NAP in the experimental mouse model of T. spiralis infection, characterized by a Th 2 immune response, which represents {{an alternative to the}} classical approach of ovalbumin-induced asthma. This experimental study offers not only the possibility to evaluate the immunological effects of the bacterial adjuvant, but also to assess parasitological issue in the immunomodulated host-parasite relationship. After a preliminary study a dosage of 10 μg of HP-NAP was chosen to be administered intraperitoneally at 10 th and 28 th day after experimental infection in correspondence with eosinophilia peak and plasma IgE level plateau in our mouse model of T. spiralis infection, respectively. HP-NAP used was cloned and espressed in the Gram positive Bacillus subtilis to avoid endotoxin contamination. Peripheral blood collection from different experimental groups (infected animals treated with HP-NAP or with PBS) allowed us to study the immune response along the infection using leukocyte count, total and parasite specific IgE level and cytokine profile determination. In addition, splenocytes from treated and control animals were used in an ex vivo system to confirm HP-NAP immunomodulation and identify cellular target and the respective receptor involved in HP-NAP signaling pathway on immunity cells. Further, in vivo experiments were performed using our bacterial adjuvant in addition to the antibody blocking the toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2) which is responsible for HP-NAP signal transmission. For the evaluation of parasitological aspects, animals were examined by histological, histochemical and immunohistochemistry analysis at muscle level and their carcasses were digested in a chloride pepsin solution for parasitological burden assessment. Results obtained from our experimental work showed HP-NAP ability to immunomodulate the Th 2 response, reducing significantly eosinophils peak and total and parasite IgE levels during the helminthic infection. HP-NAP action resulted strongly active in increasing IFN-γ and IL- 12 levels and diminishing IL- 4 and IL- 5 levels both in animals treated with HP-NAP and in ex-vivo system derived from treated infected mouse spleens compared to cells from infected animal controls. Besides, the ex-vivo experiments confirmed HP-NAP action on innate immunity cells through HP-NAP/TLR 2 binding, able to stimulate a cytokine profile expression different from that of another TLR 2 agonist such as PAM 3. All these data show that HP-NAP, acting through the TLR 2, is capable also in vivo to shift the immune response to a Th 1 phenotype. After having studied the effects of HP-NAP in immunological response, we aimed to understand the host-parasite relation focusing on Trichinella muscle phase, during which the parasite enters the striated skeletal muscle cell inducing the nurse cell formation, devoted to nourishing and to protection of the helminth. Histological analysis evidenced by means of an appropriate software an increased inflammation infiltrate surrounding nurse cell-parasite complex in HP-NAP treated animals, in addition to elevated active matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP- 9) plasma levels, considered a leukocyte transendothelial <b>migration</b> marker. Histochemical <b>staining</b> revealed a reduction in eosinophil number in muscular pericapsular inflammation in HP-NAP treated animals, confirming the decrease of these polymorphonucleate cells at blood level. This suggests that the decrease in the blood induced by HP-NAP is not due to an increased extravasation of eosinophils but rather to the reduced IL- 5 plasma levels observed in HP-NAP treated animals. Immunohistochemistry with an anti-arginase 1 antibody, an enzyme which is considered a marker of alternative macrophage activation, showed a decreased staining of this enzyme in muscle inflammatory infiltrate of treated infected animals. Surprisingly, parasite burden of HP-NAP treated animals is thrice times that of control animal. It is important underline that the first HP-NAP administration when intestinal parasite phase is not yet ended in the mouse strains used (BALB/c) shifted host immunity to a Th 1 response, which might have delayed worm expulsion, increasing the number of migrant larvae produced. Besides inverse correlation between parasite burden and Th 2 parameters (eosinophils, total and specific IgE) suggests the importance of this type of host immune response against parasite infection. Our experimental design offers a dualistic point of view. In experimental helminthic infection the molecule of bacterial origin confirms its immunological potential, shifting host immune response to Trichinella infection. Immunomodulation of parasite infection provides new information on host- parasite relationship: in our model the Th 2 immune response acquires an host protective value in favor of host defense versus massive Trichinella infection in muscle...|$|R
