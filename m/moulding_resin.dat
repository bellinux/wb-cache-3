It focuses {{on the development of}} empirically derived models for the permeability and compaction behaviour of Unifilo during light resin transfer moulding. A detailed review of relevant literature allowed identification of important material parameters, and appropriate testing procedures were devised accordingly.

A material response for each stage of the process was quantified and then inputted into the light resin transfer moulding simulation developed in the Part I of this study. Results were verified using data from an empirical testbed, and the completed light resin transfer moulding model was then applied to a 6 -kW wind turbine blade case study to evaluate different infusion strategies and minimise fill time.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{explains}} {{a method to}} proceed to the optimization of the milling of pockets {{in order to save}} time during the machining of RTM <b>moulds.</b> <b>Resin</b> Transfer <b>Moulding</b> (RTM) is a process for the manufacturing of composite parts. The main idea is to inject a resin into a reinforced fabric made from fibers. Most of the RTM moulds are made up of a cavity, a lid and many inserts filling this cavity. Machining of the cavity is time consuming, especially if parts to be manufactured are big. In order to save time and so, to save money, we propose a method to find the best set of parameters for the machining of a pocket. To reach this goal, we apply an optimization method, called simulated annealing, that takes parameters from a large range of predefined values and computes the related machining time. At the end of the simulation, the algorithm gives us the best combination of tool geometry and machining parameters, according with respect of different predefined constraints (pocket geometry, characteristics of the milling machine and roughness admitted on the final part) ...|$|R

40|$|AIM: This study {{aimed to}} verify the {{influence}} of oral environment and denture cleansers on the surface roughness and hardness of two different denture base materials. METHODS: A total of sixteen identical removable disc specimens (RDS) were processed. Eight RDS were made from heat-cured acrylic resin (AR) and the other eight were fabricated from thermoplastic injection <b>moulded</b> <b>resin</b> (TR). Surface roughness and hardness of DRS were measured using ultrasonic profilometry and Universal testing machine respectively. Then the four RDS (two AR and two of TR) were fixed to each maxillary denture, after three months RDS were retrieved. Surface roughness and hardness of RDS have measured again. RESULTS: The surface roughness measurements revealed no significant difference (p > 0. 05) for both disc groups at baseline. However, both groups showed {{a significant increase in}} the surface roughness after three months with higher mean value for (TR) group. On the other hand, the (AR) group showed higher hardness mean value than (TR) group at baseline with no significant decrease in the hardness values (p > 0. 05) following three months follow-up period.

The appearance of the helmet is also similar to the M1 type, though the shape of the helmet brim is slightly longer. In addition, as the M1 helmet was designed to fit the head of a typical Anglo-Saxon American, the inner helmet liner was re-designed to remove the problem of instability while being used by a Japanese wearer. Whereas the design of pre-war helmets was to prevent bullet penetration through the hardness of the helmet, the Type 66 high manganese steel helmet is designed to dent utilising the high flexibility of the material. For this reason, rather than wear the helmet directly on the head as with pre-war designs, the helmet is a dual structure, with the shell sitting on top of the helmet liner with a gap between the two layers.The material of the helmet liner is simple <b>moulded</b> <b>resin.</b> The total weight of the outer shell and helmet liner is 1.4 kilograms. The newer Kevlar helmet Type 88 model was adopted in 1988, however a full update to that model has not yet taken place within the JSDF.

However, these and other features such as the crimp or waviness in woven fabrics make real materials {{more complex than the}} simplified models. Clustering of fibres creates fibre-rich and resin-rich volumes (FRV and RRV respectively) in the composites.
