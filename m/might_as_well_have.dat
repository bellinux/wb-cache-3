5|$|Plan after plan is thwarted: Elaine tries bribing the maître d'hôtel, but is unsuccessful. They {{contemplate}} {{on getting}} food to go, but they can't eat Chinese {{food in a}} taxicab. Elaine is ravenous, but refuses to eat concession stand food at the movie theater. After missing Tatiana's call, George decides he's {{no longer in the}} mood for the film, Elaine wants to leave and get a hamburger, and Jerry decides that he <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> dinner with his uncle.

25|$|In fact, as guessed in 1995, {{the reasons}} for the poor {{performance}} of microkernels <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been: (1) an actual inefficiency of the whole microkernel approach, (2) the particular concepts implemented in those microkernels, and (3) the particular implementation of those concepts. Therefore it remained to be studied if the solution to build an efficient microkernel was, unlike previous attempts, to apply the correct construction techniques.|$|E

25|$|An {{area where}} African Americans in general {{outstrip}} whites {{is in their}} condemnation of homosexuality. Prominent leaders in the Black church have demonstrated against gay rights issues such as gay marriage. This stands {{in stark contrast to}} the down-low phenomenon of covert male–male sexual acts. There are those within the community who take a different position, notably the late Coretta Scott King and the Reverend Al Sharpton, the latter of whom, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that he <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been asked if he supported black marriage or white marriage.|$|E

500|$|The Iowa State Cyclones {{football}} {{program is a}} college football team that represents Iowa State University in the Big 12 Conference in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The team has had 32 head coaches since organized football at the school began in 1892, and was officially sanctioned in 1894. Originally, the Iowa Agricultural College teams were known as the Cardinals. The name was changed after September 29, 1895, when under coach Pop Warner, the Cardinals defeated the Northwestern Wildcats, 36–0. Inspired by an extremely active tornado (then known as a [...] "cyclone") season, the next day, the Chicago Tribune headline read: [...] "Struck by a Cyclone." [...] The article went on to say, [...] "Northwestern <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> tried to play football with an Iowa cyclone as with the Iowa team it met yesterday." [...] Since then the Iowa State teams have been known as the Cyclones.|$|E
500|$|Two {{other player}} {{gambling}} affairs marked Landis's early years as commissioner. In 1922, Giants pitcher Phil Douglas, embittered at McGraw for disciplining him for heavy drinking, {{wrote a letter}} to Cardinals outfielder Leslie Mann, suggesting that he would take a bribe to ensure the Giants did not win the pennant. Although Mann had been a friend, the outfielder neither smoked nor drank and had long been associated with the YMCA movement; according to baseball historian Lee Allen, Douglas <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> sent the letter to Landis himself. Mann immediately turned over the letter to his manager, Branch Rickey, who ordered Mann to contact Landis at once. The Giants placed Douglas on the ineligible list, an action backed by Landis after meeting with the pitcher. [...] On September 27, 1924, Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell offered Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 if Sand didn't [...] "bear down too hard against us today". [...] Sand was initially inclined to let the matter pass, but recalling the fate of Weaver and other Black Sox players, told his manager, Art Fletcher. Fletcher met with Heydler, who contacted Landis. O'Connell did not deny the bribe attempt, and was placed on the ineligible list.|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Waldron {{had a major}} {{breakdown}} caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as we came out of the clubs after work. We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} September 1994 {{floppy disk}} release of System Shock had no support for spoken dialogue. The enhanced CD-ROM {{was released in}} December 1994, which featured full speech for logs and e-mails, multiple display resolutions, and more detailed graphics. The CD-ROM version is often considered to be superior to the floppy version. After completing work on the sound and music for the floppy version, LoPiccolo recorded all of the spoken dialogue for the CD release, using company employees and his friends' voices, which he mixed with ambient sounds to create [...] "audio vignettes". Doug Church later said, [...] "We tried {{to keep them from}} shipping the floppy version and instead just ship the CD version, but Origin would have none of it". System Shock producer Warren Spector later expressed regret concerning the floppy version, stating, [...] "I wish I could go back and make the decision not to ship the floppy version months before the full-speech CD version. The additional audio added so much it <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been a different game. The CD version seemed so much more, well, modern. And the perception of Shock was cemented in the press and in people's minds by the floppy version (the silent movie version!). I really think that cost us sales..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ayckbourn also heavily criticised the West End for casting cinema, pop and {{television}} stars instead of theatre actors, particularly {{their lack of}} voice projection. He singled out his harshest criticism for casting Madonna in David Williamson's Up for Grabs, saying [...] "You <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> put her on stage eating a plate of spaghetti and put a rope round her chair instead of putting her in a theatre where she wasn't at home and was struggling." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bennett {{made only}} five {{movies in the}} decade that followed, as the {{shooting}} incident was a stain on her career and she became virtually blacklisted.

2500|$|After the Australian {{team was}} knocked out of the tournament {{as a result of}} a {{controversial}} penalty given against defender Lucas Neill in their Second round match against Italy, Australian assistant coach Graham Arnold was quoted as saying, [...] "We are a small footballing nation that gets no favours.

[...] However, word quickly spread and 63white residents quickly signed a petition demanding {{a reversal of the}} policy.
