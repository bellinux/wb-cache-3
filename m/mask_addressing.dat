40|$|Computer Generated Holography {{achieves}} patterned illumination at {{the sample}} plane through phase modulation {{of the laser}} beam at the objective back aperture. This is obtained by using liquid crystal-based spatial light modulators (LC-SLMs), which modulate the spatial phase of the incident laser beam. A variety of algorithms are employed to calculate the phase modulation <b>masks</b> <b>addressed</b> to the LC-SLM. These algorithms range from simple gratings-and-lenses to generate multiple diffraction-limited spots, to iterative Fourier-transform algorithms capable of generating arbitrary illumination shapes perfectly tailored {{on the base of}} the target contour. Applications for holographic light patterning include multi-trap optical tweezers, patterned voltage imaging and optical control of neuronal excitation using uncaging or optogenetics. These past implementations of computer generated holography used binary input profile to generate binary light distribution at the sample plane. Here we demonstrate that using graded input sources, enables generating intensity graded light patterns and extend the range of application of holographic light illumination. At first, we use intensity-graded holograms to compensate for LC-SLM position dependent diffraction efficiency or sample fluorescence inhomogeneity. Finally we show that intensity-graded holography can be used to equalize photo evoked currents from cells expressing different level of chanelrhodopsin 2 (ChR 2), one of the most commonly used optogenetics light gated channels, taking into account the non-linear dependence of channel opening on incident light...|$|R

While the light field recolorization is obtained with a straightforward diffusion, the inpainting application is particularly challenging, as the structure tensors accounting for disparities are unknown under the occluding <b>mask.</b> We <b>address</b> this issue with a disparity inpainting {{by means of an}} interpolation constrained by superpixel boundaries.

40|$|Abstract. The {{types of}} stimuli used as targets and masks {{considerably}} change the masking functions {{in a way}} that requires us to abandon any single mechanism of masking as the sole explanation of backward masking. In the first of two reports in which the problem of the maskdependence of <b>masking</b> is <b>addressed,</b> we explore the role of the relative spatial positioning of targets and masks in order to differentiate between local interaction and attentional models. If single letters were masked by double-letter masks then the relative spatial arrangement of the letters, which was changed in order to vary the involvement of metacontrast-like processes, had an effect at shorter SOAs, but not at longer SOAs where strong masking still persisted. This poses difficulties for proposing local contour interaction as the main mechanism of masking. Similarly, crowding effects alone cannot explain the results. Backward masking also involves attention being directed to working-memory processing of the succeeding object while abandoning the preceding object. ...|$|R

A distribution fitting method is used to generalize to unseen signal-to-noise ratio conditions and voice activity detection based adaptationisusedtogeneralizetounseen noise conditions. Systematic evaluation and comparison show that the proposed approach produces high quality IBM estimates under unseen conditions.

Background: This study {{aimed to}} examine the knowledge, attitudes, and {{practices}} towards the use of facemasks among hospital-based health care workers (HCWs) in Hanoi, Vietnam. Methods: A qualitative study incorporating 20 focus groups was conducted between August 2010 and May 2011. HCWs from 7 hospitals in Vietnam were invited to participate. Results: Issues associated with the availability of facemasks (medical and cloth masks) and respirators was the strongest theme {{to emerge from the}} discussion. Participants reported that {{it is not unusual for}} some types of facemasks to be unavailable during nonemergency periods. It was highlighted that the use of facemasks and respirators is not continuous, but rather is limited to selected situations, locations, and patients. Reuse of facemasks and respirators is also common in some settings. Finally, some participants reported believing that the reuse of facemasks, particularly cloth masks, is safe, whereas others believed that the reuse of masks put staff at risk of infection. Conclusions: In low and middle-income countries, access to appropriate levels of personal protective equipment may be restricted owing to competing demands for funding in hospital settings. It is important that issues around reuse and extended use of medical masks/respirators and decontamination of cloth <b>masks</b> are <b>addressed</b> in policy documents to minimize the risk of infection...|$|R
