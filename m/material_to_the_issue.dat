5000|$|Perjury {{operates}} in American law as an inherited {{principle of the}} common law of England, which defined the act as the [...] "willful and corrupt giving, upon a lawful oath, or in any form allowed by law to be substituted for an oath, in a judicial proceeding or course of justice, of a false testimony <b>material</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> or matter of inquiry." [...] William Blackstone touched on the subject in his Commentaries on the Laws of England, establishing perjury as [...] "a crime committed when a lawful oath is administered, in some judicial proceeding, {{to a person who}} swears willfully, absolutely, and falsely, in a matter <b>material</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> or point in question." [...] The punishment for perjury under the common law has varied from death to banishment and has included such grotesque penalties as severing the tongue of the perjurer. The definitional structure of perjury provides an important framework for legal proceedings, as the component parts of this definition have permeated jurisdictional lines, finding a home in American legal constructs. As such, the main tenets of perjury, including mens rea, a lawful oath, occurring during a judicial proceeding, a false testimony have remained necessary pieces of perjury’s definition in the United States.|$|E
50|$|But {{there are}} clear {{situations}} where the evidence which {{formed the basis for}} the assignment of perjury is clearly unconnected to the main issue in dispute. In that case the materiality requirement as a criterion for culpability is then justified. In the case of Omoregie v D.P.P, three assignments were made against the accused (appellant) in a civil case and, the question arose as to whether those assignments were material to main issue in dispute, and whether the appellant made the false statements knowingly. The dispute centered on whether or not the appellant held himself out or was employed as an agent personally responsible for monies on all cement sold out to customers on credit. The first count of the perjury charge was with regard to the money the Plaintiff (a company in Germany) transferred to the appellant in Lagos. The appellant said in his evidence that the alleged money had been transferred before his return to Lagos from Germany. Exhibit ‘AA’ and ‘BB’ which were letters written by the appellant corroborated his evidence that he was still awaiting a transfer of the money two weeks after his return to Lagos. In view of the time lapse between the period these letters were written and the period the appellant gave his oral evidence the Supreme Court was of view that the appellant memory might have been playing him false. Apart from the lapse of time which affects memory the court was also of the opinion that even if the evidence on this point was false {{it may not be a}} basis for culpability unless it is shown that such evidence was deliberately made with knowledge of its falsehood. And more importantly the court found that even if the evidence was false it was not <b>material</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> in dispute.|$|E

40|$|Although it now covers {{more than}} court proceedings, the {{definition}} of perjury has not changed a great deal otherwise since the framing of the Constitution. Blackstone described it as "a crime committed when a lawful oath is administered, in some judicial proceeding, {{to a person who}} swears wilfully, absolutely and falsely, in a matter <b>material</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> or point in question. " There are three general federal perjury laws. One, 18 U. S. C. 1621, outlaws presenting material false statements under oath in federal official proceedings. A second, 18 U. S. C. 1623, bars presenting material false statements under oath before or ancillary to federal court or grand jury proceedings. A third, 18 U. S. C. 1622 (subornation of perjury), prohibits inducing or procuring another to commit perjury in violation of either Section 1621 or Section 1623. In most cases, the courts abbreviate their description of the elements and state that to prove perjury under Section 1623 the government must establish that the defendant "(1) knowingly made a (2) false (3) material declaration (4) under oath (5) in a proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States. " The courts generally favor the encapsulation from United States v. Dunnigan to describe the elements of Section 1621 : "A witness testifying under oath or affirmation violates this section if she gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory. " Section 1622 outlaws procuring or inducing another to commit perjury: "Whoever procures another to commit any perjury is guilty of subornation of perjury, and shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both", 18 U. S. C. 1622. The false statement statute, 18 U. S. C. 1001, is closely akin to the perjury statutes. It outlaws false statements in any matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency or department, a kind of perjury with oath prohibition.

This article makes the case for utility-maximizing agents and for avoiding infinite sets in agent definitions. It shows how to avoid agent self-delusion using model-based utility functions and how to avoid agents that corrupt their reward generators (sometimes called "perverse instantiation") using utility functions that evaluate outcomes {{at one point in}} time from the perspective of humans at a different point in time. It argues that agents can avoid unintended instrumental actions (sometimes called "basic AI drives" or "instrumental goals") by accurately learning human values.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of thermal properties {{continues to be}} a challenge facing the development of composite phase change <b>materials.</b> <b>To</b> overcome <b>the</b> practical <b>issues</b> of current techniques a new experimental method was developed. The system is modelled using two fundamental models and a simplified analytical representation. Pure myristic acid is used for validation and a performance comparison based on time, accuracy and stability. All three approaches perform comparatively well in terms of accuracy with an average prediction error of less than one third of a degree and all thermal properties in line with expectations. The enthalpy model is susceptible <b>to</b> instability while <b>the</b> effective heat capacity method does not show any such behaviour. In addition, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> choice of a smooth function for the transition from liquid to solid, this method delivers more realistic behaviour. The effective heat capacity method is faster than the enthalpy method by a factor of three, but the analytical approach is the fastest. However for a more robust and comprehensive representation the effective heat capacity method is preferred.

40|$|From time <b>to</b> time <b>the</b> {{public is}} {{informed}} about {{the start of the}} sporting struggles. Championship, Olympics, qualifications and eliminations are events that have become part of individual media centers programs. For many years, during such events there is a discussion about doping. It is widely criticized as an example of violation of fair play principle, which has been present for many generations in sport. This subject was completed in recent years on discussions related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> application of gene doping. There is currently no verified information indicating that any of the countries apply similar techniques to assist athletes. Whether similar action would be unethical? Does gene doping violate the principles of fair play? Did the law define the term of gene doping? In the proposed speech there will be taken reflection on these topics. It will be carried out by the use of appearing during a sports event media <b>materials</b> relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> abovementioned <b>issues.</b> It will be also assisted by fiction literature, raising in recent years the topic of gene doping.
