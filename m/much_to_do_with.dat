5|$|As indicated, hospice is {{frequently}} under-utilized and often not {{taken advantage of}} until very late in a patient's illness. The reasons for this have as <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> financial considerations as with the psycho-social difficulty in choosing hospice. A 2009 study found that with proper case management hospice access could be liberalized without additional costs to insurers.|$|E

5|$|Edward did {{not have}} <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> any of this; after around 1375 he played a limited role in the {{government}} of the realm. Around 29 September 1376 he fell ill with a large abscess. After a brief period of recovery in February 1377, the king died of a stroke at Sheen on 21 June. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old grandson, King Richard II, son of the Black Prince, since the Black Prince himself had died on 8 June 1376.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrain of}} the {{peninsula}} has <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the geology of the Aegean Region in general. The peninsula was shaped into its current form over several geological eras with the tectonic merging of Paleozoic schist formations, Mesozoic limestone and marble deposits, and finally the accretion of large clays and other sediments during the Neogene period. This is partly because of Turkey's unstable fault block terrain, {{and because of the}} close proximity of the Anatolian-Aegean plate boundary, which generates massifs of mountains all across western Turkey. This includes the peninsula and the mountains surrounding the Büyük Menderes River, known collectively as the Menderes Massif.|$|E
5|$|There are countless {{subjects}} that {{are affected by}} the ideas developed in the philosophy of mind. Clear examples of this are the nature of death and its definitive character, the nature of emotion, of perception and of memory. Questions about what a person is and what his or her identity consists of also have <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the philosophy of mind. There are two {{subjects that}}, in connection with the philosophy of the mind, have aroused special attention: free will and the self.|$|E

When his opportunity did come, Alan proved a real stalwart. In addition, his Trumperian style must have influenced for good vast numbers of young boys. Unquestionably, the line of Trumper and Kippax has <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the grace and elegance which is more frequently associated with players from NSW than from other States.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these small}} reforms, the 18th century ended with {{continuous}} and unrestrained {{attacks on the}} Court. Although complaints had been common {{since the time of}} Elizabeth I, the problems had become more unrestrained, {{at the same time as}} politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number. Many critics were barristers of the common law, ignorant of the court's workings, but some, such as Sir Samuel Romilly, had trained as a Chancery advocate and were well aware of the Chancery's procedure. The success of the Code Napoleon and the writings of Jeremy Bentham are seen by academic Duncan Kerly to have had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the criticism, and the growing wealth of the country and increasing international trade meant it was crucial that there be a functioning court system for matters of equity. While the upper classes had been struggling with the Court for centuries, and regarded it as a necessary evil, the growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding. With increasing court backlogs, it was clear to many law reformers and politicians that serious reform was needed.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the first}} couple of years of his company, Goldfaden did not shy away from serious themes: his rained-out {{vaudeville}} in Botoşani had been Di Rekruten (The Recruits), playing with the theme of the press gangs working the streets of that town to conscript young men into the army. Before the end of 1876, Goldfaden had already translated Desolate Island by August von Kotzebue; thus, a play by a German aristocrat and Russian spy became the first non-comic play performed professionally in Yiddish. After his initial burst of mostly vaudevilles and light comedies (although Shmendrik and The Two Kuni-Lemls were reasonably sophisticated plays), Goldfaden would go on to write many serious Yiddish-language plays on Jewish themes, perhaps the most famous being Shulamith, also from 1880. Goldfaden himself suggested that this increasingly serious turn became possible because he had educated his audience. Nahma Sandrow suggests that it may have had equally as <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the arrival in Romania, {{at the time of the}} Russo-Turkish War, of Russian Jews who had been exposed to more sophisticated Russian language theater. Goldfaden's strong turn toward almost uniformly serious subject matter roughly coincided with bringing his troupe to Odessa.|$|E

40|$|Scholars {{working on}} {{transition}} countries {{are generally more}} hesitant {{than they used to}} be about using the term 'reformer'. However, few scholars have explored why the term may be unhelpful or what the consequences are if we jettison it for how we think about reform. Such issues form the central focus of the paper. Looking at Vietnam's second city and business centre, Ho Chi Minh City, the paper argues that the main problem with identifying politicians as reformers is that it gives a distorted picture of what reform is actually about, particularly its underlying logic. In the author's view, what drives so-called reform has <b>much</b> less <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> issues of ideology, as the focus on reformers would suggest, and <b>much</b> more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the playing out of rivalries between new state business interests, which have emerged largely since the late 1980 s.

Some researchers believe that German's rejection of Oswald's marriage proposal may have had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his disillusionment with life in the Soviet Union and his decision to return to the United States.|$|E

Two years after its implementation, {{a study published in}} The Tennessean showed that the percentage of third graders reading at or above grade level had increased from 53% to 74%. However, a report by the think tank Education Sector suggested that specific teacher training had at least as <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the student improvement.|$|E
25|$|The Western Theater {{typically}} receives {{less attention}} than the Eastern Theater. This has <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the greater proximity {{of action in}} the east to capitals and to major population centers. However, some historians consider it the war's most important theater. While the Eastern Theater essentially remained in stalemate until 1864, Union troops in the west, beginning in 1861, were able to steadily surround and drive back the Confederate troops, forcing them into eventual capitulation. This was done through a steady series of Union victories in major battles, interrupted by only a single defeat, which took place at Chickamauga.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of the limited scope (or extent) of the atonement is intimately tied up with the {{doctrine of}} the nature of the atonement. It also has <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the general Calvinist view of predestination. Calvinists advocate the satisfaction theory of the atonement, which developed in the writings of Anselm of Canterbury and Thomas Aquinas. In brief, the Calvinistic refinement of this theory, known as penal substitution, states that the atonement of Christ pays the penalty incurred by the sins of menthat is, Christ receives the wrath of God for sins and thereby receives in himself the penalty of the sins of men.|$|E
