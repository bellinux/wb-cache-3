40|$|Entity and {{referential}} integrity {{are the most}} fundamental constraints that any relational database should satisfy. We re-examine these fundamental constraints {{in the context of}} incomplete relations, which may have null values of the types "value exists but is unknown" and "value does not exist". We argue that in practice the restrictions that these constraints impose on the occurrences of null values in relations are too strict. We justify a generalisation of the said constraints wherein we use <b>key</b> <b>families,</b> which are collections of attribute sets of a relation schema, rather than keys, and foreign <b>key</b> <b>families</b> which are collections of pairs of attribute sets of two relation schemas, rather than foreign keys. Intuitively, a <b>key</b> <b>family</b> is satisfied in an incomplete relation if each one of its tuples is uniquely identifiable on the union of the attribute sets of the <b>key</b> <b>family,</b> in all possible worlds of the incomplete relation, and, in addition, is distinguishable from all the other tupl [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that are most troubling to veterans with TBI {{and their families and}} identify veteran-family differences in content and ranking. Instead of standardized measures of symptom frequency or severity, which may be insensitive to change or intervention effects, we used a target outcome measure for veterans with TBI and their <b>key</b> <b>family</b> members, which elicited open-ended reports concerning the three most serious TBI-related problems. This was followed by Likert-scaled ratings of difficulty in managing the problem. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, interviews were conducted in veterans’ homes. Participants included 83 veterans with TBI diagnosed at a Veterans Affairs medical rehabilitation service and a <b>key</b> <b>family</b> member of each veteran. We utilized open-ended questions to determine the problems caused by TBI within the last month. Sociodemographic characteristics of veterans and family members, and veterans’ military and medical characteristics were collected. A coding scheme was developed to categorize open-ended responses. Results: Families identified nearly twice as many categories of problems as did veterans, and veterans and families ranked problem categories very differently. Veterans ranked cognitive and physical problems worst; families ranked emotional and interpersonal problems worst. Conclusions: Easily administered open-ended questions about the most troubling TBI-related problems yield novel insights and reveal important veteran-family discrepancies...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} the baseline data for selected <b>key</b> <b>family</b> practices for implementing the Community Component of IMCI in the Muscat Governorate, Sultanate of Oman. For this purpose, {{we conducted a}} situation analysis to assess the adherence to the <b>key</b> <b>family</b> practices. Methods: A pre-tested structured qualitative questionnaire was developed. Data were collected from the participants (mothers) with an Anti Natal Card Number (ANC) living in the Muscat Governorate. The data collection started from January 2014 and concluded in December 2014. The 12 <b>key</b> <b>family</b> practices were adopted from World Health Organization (WHO) and modified according to the Omani context. Capacity building to perform the field survey followed this. The capacity building was based on identifying the regional focal points along with the task force that consisted of head of Health Education in each district (Wilayat) and identifying the Community Support Groups (CSGs). The task force was trained {{to reach out to}} the participants and get the responses on a voluntary basis. Results: Only 9 % of the participants were exclusively breast-feeding their infants, 26 % reduced feeding when their children had diarrhea while 6 % stopped feeding their child completely, 19. 1 % did not know how to prepare Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS), 61 % took their child to a medical facility immediately when there was cough or cold, 22 % started complimentary feeding before the age of 6 months, 12. 7 % did not know about the WHO recommended total calorie intake for their child, 15. 5 % did not have any idea about the dietary requirements for their children, 39 % stated that if their child had diarrhea, they would not change the diet, 12 % stated that they had no idea about the general danger signs, 55. 8 % stated that cough and cold was a direct consequence of exposing the child to cold weather, 23 % stated that in a situation where their child was not improving, they would immediately change the doctor.
