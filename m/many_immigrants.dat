5|$|By 2000 Gulfton was {{the most}} densely {{populated}} community in Houston, with 71 percent Hispanic residents, including many recent immigrants from Mexico and Central America.

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>immigrants</b> openly flouted Mexican law, {{especially}} the prohibition against slavery. Combined with United States' attempts to purchase Texas, Mexican authorities decided in 1830 to prohibit continued immigration from the United States.

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>immigrants</b> have {{established}} themselves in Brabrand, Hasle and Viby, where {{the percentage of}} inhabitants with foreign origins has risen by 66% since the year 2000.

In Brabrand and Gellerup, two-thirds of the population now have a non-Danish ethnic background. The international cultures present in the community are an obvious and visible part of the city's daily life and contribute many cultural flavours hitherto uncommon for the Nordic countries, including Bazar Vest, a market with shopkeepers predominantly of foreign descent.|$|E

5|$|Poland {{signed a}} treaty with Czechoslovakia in Warsaw on 13 June 1958 {{confirming}} the border as it existed on 1 January 1938. After the Communist takeover of power, the industrial boom continued and <b>many</b> <b>immigrants</b> {{arrived in the}} area (mostly {{from other parts of}} Czechoslovakia, mainly from Slovakia). The arrival of Slovaks significantly changed the ethnic structure of the area, as almost all the Slovak immigrants assimilated into the Czech majority in the course of time. The number of self-declared Slovaks is rapidly declining. The last Slovak elementary school was closed in Karviná several years ago. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, Zaolzie {{has been part of the}} independent Czech Republic. However a significant Polish minority still remains there.|$|E
