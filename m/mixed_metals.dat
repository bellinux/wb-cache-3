60|$|If {{the value}} of the maravedi had {{remained}} unchanged in Spain down to the present day, {{it would be easy to}} reduce a sum of the time of Ferdinand and Isabella into a correspondent sum of current money; but by the successive depreciations of the coin of Vellon, or <b>mixed</b> <b>metals,</b> issued since that period, the real and maravedi of Vellon, which had replaced the ancient currency, were reduced, towards the year 1700, to about a third of the old real and maravedi, now known as the real and maravedi of silver. As, however, the ancient piece of 8 reals was equal approximately to the ounce of silver, and the duro, or dollar of the present day, is likewise equal to an ounce, they may be considered identical. Indeed, in Spanish America, the dollar, instead of being divided into 20 reals, as in Spain, is divided into only 8 parts called reals, which evidently represent the real of the time of Ferdinand and Isabella, as the dollar does the real of 8. But the ounce of silver was anciently worth 276-1/4 maravedis; the dollar, therefore, is likewise equal to 276 1/4 maravedis. By converting then the sums mentioned in this work into maravedis, they have been afterwards reduced into dollars by dividing by 276 1/4.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: Metal {{reduction}} kinetics {{have been}} studied in cultures of dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria which include the Shewanella oneidensis strain MR- 1. Estimation of system parameters from time series data faces obstructions in the implementation depending on {{the choice of the}} mathematical model that captures the observed dynamics. The modeling of metal reduction is often based on Michaelis-Menten equations. These models are often developed using initial in vitro reaction rates and seldom match with in vivo reduction profiles. Results: For metal reduction studies, we propose a model that is based on the power law representation that is effectively applied to the kinetics of metal reduction. The method yields reasonable parameter estimates and is illustrated with the analysis of time-series data that describes the dynamics of metal reduction in S. oneidensis strain MR- 1. In addition, mixed metal studies involving the reduction of Uranyl (U(VI)) to the relatively insoluble tetravalent form (U(IV)) by Shewanella alga strain (BR-Y) were studied in the presence of environmentally relevant iron hydrous oxides. For <b>mixed</b> <b>metals,</b> parameter estimation and curve fitting are accomplished with a generalized least squares formulation that handles systems of ordinary differential equations and is implemented in Matlab. It consists of an optimization algorithm (Levenberg-Marquardt, LSQCURVEFIT) and a numerical ODE solver.

40|$|The {{contamination}} of the environment has led to a need to develop innovative processes to remediate the contaminated sites. This research developed two processes for remediating soils contaminated with metal wastes. The four primary metal contaminants were chromium, nickel, cadmium and copper. Only chromium exceeded the EPA required action levels. Both processes utilized mineral processing techniques to make a size separation since the majority of the contamination existed within the fines or minus 20 micron material. This size separation reduced the amount of soil requiring further treatment. The first process was focused at recovering the metal contaminants from the soil for reuse in other industries. Chromium required recovery mainly because it exceeded the EPA action levels but it also had a potential reuse in the steel industry. Copper was evaluated for recovery strictly for its potential resale value. A <b>mixed</b> <b>metals</b> precipitate would also be recovered for potential use at a recycling facility. Sulfuric, oxalic, and hydrochloric acid were tested for their ability to leach the contaminants from the soil. The sulfuric acid leach was then optimized for pH and leach time. Consequently, a conceptual recovery process utilizing cementation to recover the copper, pH adjustment to precipitate a ferro-chrome, and further pH adjustment to precipitate a <b>mixed</b> <b>metals</b> precipitate was developed. Due to the amount of by-product produced from this process and the large quantity of reagents required, a second process was developed. The second process was focused at only removing and recovering the chromium since it was the only contaminant that exceeded EPA action levels. Following the size separation, the soil was subjected to a hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite leach. This leach was performed at slightly acidic conditions to use hypochlorous acid as the oxidizing agent. This leach oxidized the chromium from the trivalent to the hexavalent state thereby increasing its solubility. Once the chromium, as HCrO₄⁻, had gone into solution, the liquid was separated and sent to reduction processing. Using sulfur dioxide, the hexavalent chromium was reduced back to the trivalent state and with the addition of sodium hydroxide, the chromium precipitated...|$|E
