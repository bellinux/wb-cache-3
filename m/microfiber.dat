The chitosan <b>microfibers</b> showed a three-dimensional pore structure by SEM. The chitosan <b>microfibers</b> supported attachment and viability of rat muscle-derived stem cells (rMDSCs). Subcutaneous implantation of the chitosan <b>microfibers</b> demonstrated that implantation of rMDSCs containing chitosan <b>microfibers</b> induced lower host tissue responses with decreased macrophage accumulation than did the chitosan <b>microfibers</b> alone, {{probably due to the}} immunosuppression of the transplanted rMDSCs.

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) has a limited ability to repair itself. In an effort to repair the CNS, stem cells can be transplanted into the damaged area. However, these cells often show limited {{survival}} and integration {{due to lack of}} support. This project explores a potential method of neural stem cell delivery to the CNS using biocompatible <b>microfibers.</b> Poly (ε-caprolactone), a FDA approved polymer, is used to make <b>microfibers</b> with various diameters and shapes in hopes of creating a suitable microenvironment for stem cells to grow and differentiate. The cells used are adult hippocampal progenitor cells (AHPCs), which can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. This project investigates the adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of rat AHPCs on <b>microfibers</b> in vitro using fluorescent microscopy. Our results indicate that PCL <b>microfibers</b> support cell adhesion and survival. Additionally, <b>microfibers</b> showed an increase in cell proliferation and astrocyte differentiation when compared to planar controls. These results suggest that the <b>microfibers</b> may be specifically supporting gliogenesis. In conclusion, PCL <b>microfibers</b> can support the adherence, proliferation, and differentiation of AHPCs in vitro. Future studies will investigate the ability of the <b>microfibers</b> to support transplanted stem cells in vivo...|$|R

Fabricated Fbg <b>microfibers</b> were investigated for their biomolecule encapsulation, cell adhesion, and proliferations. <b>Microfibers</b> with three different concentrations of Fbg (5, 10, and 15 wt%) were prepared by a gel solvent-extraction method using a silicone rubber tube. Fbg <b>microfibers</b> were covalently modified with fibronectin (FN) by using water-soluble 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide as the cross-linking agent. Fbg <b>microfibers</b> were characterized by their FN cross-linking properties, structural morphology, and in vitro degradation. Furthermore, FN/Fbg <b>microfibers</b> were evaluated for cell attachment and proliferation. The biocompatibility and cell proliferation of the <b>microfibers</b> were assessed by measuring adenosine triphosphate activity in C 2 C 12 fibroblast cells. Cell attachment and proliferation on <b>microfibers</b> were further examined using fluorescence and scanning electron microscopic images. FN loading on the <b>microfibers</b> was confirmed by fluorescence and infrared spectroscopy. Surface morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and showed highly aligned nanostructures for fibers made with 15 wt% Fbg, a more porous structure for fibers made with 10 wt% Fbg, and a less porous structure for those made with 5 wt% Fbg. Controlled biodegradation of the fiber was observed for 8 weeks by using an in vitro proteolytic degradation assay. Fbg <b>microfibers</b> with highly aligned nanostructures (15 wt%) showed enhanced biomolecule encapsulation, as well as higher cell adhesion and proliferation than another two types of FN/Fbg fibers (5 and 10 wt%) and unmodified Fbg fibers.
