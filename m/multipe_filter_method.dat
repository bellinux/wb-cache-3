Furthermore, wrapper feature selection techniques employing several search strategies such as the sequential forward search, the oscillating search, and the sequential floating forward search are {{also included in the}} comparative study.

Both open-loop identification and closed- loop identification were simulated. Closed-loop mode identification was more challenging than open-loop identification because of the decreasing signal-to-noise ratio as the vibration became reduced. The closed-loop simulation considered both local-model identification, with measured vibration feedback and global-model identification with feedback of the identified uncontrolled vibration.
