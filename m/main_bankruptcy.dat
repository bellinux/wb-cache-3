Where appropriate, in proposing solutions for various issues lessons will be taken from the experience of both England and the US. This thesis consists of six chapters. The first chapter is a general introduction to the thesis which outlines the structure and scope of the study. Chapter Two critically explores the <b>main</b> theories underpinning <b>bankruptcy</b> law across the world. The aim of this exploration is to provide a general understanding of the policies underpinning bankruptcy laws and to establish the view of this thesis. Chapter Three discusses the experience of England and the US by identifying the main differences and similarities between bankruptcy proceedings in these jurisdictions; such discussion is necessary as a basis for determining the possibility of taking lessons from these developed bankruptcy regimes. Chapter Four provides a critical analysis of the current bankruptcy regime in Oman and outlines the key features of this regime. This chapter also discusses in detail the main issues with the current bankruptcy regime. This discussion includes: (1) the definition of bankruptcy; (2) the qualification of persons administering bankruptcy processes (3) ranking of creditors; (4) position of employees; (5) available alternatives under the current regime; and (6) the effect of declaration of bankruptcy on existing contracts. Chapter Five outlines the possibility of legal transplants and why it is desirable for Oman to adopt some of the bankruptcy principles that are found in England and the US. However, to avoid the risk of rejection of such transplants, this thesis will highlight the necessity of assessing the functionality and workability of western bankruptcy principles before transplanting them. This chapter also offers a proposal for future bankruptcy reform in Oman. Such reforms include having a clear statutory mandate, making bankruptcy law certain and predictable, and establishing a bankruptcy regime that encourage the rehabilitation of viable enterprises instead of liquidating them. Chapter Six is the overall conclusion of this thesis which explains the main ideas discussed and highlights the main contributions made by this study. Sultan Qaboos Universit...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three sections. The first section examines the effect of monetary incentives on student performance in public education in Texas. I address {{how to deal with}} non-random samples caused by self-selection bias by using propensity score matching method. For the second part, using household level panel data, it addresses the substantial heterogeneity across demographic groups. In addition, for the last section, I also investigate firm?s optimal innovation strategy. It addresses the relationship among firm growth, firm size and firm behavior in the U. S. manufacturing industry. The first section investigates the causal relationship between a teacher incentive program (District Awards for Teacher Excellence (D. A. T. E.) Program) and student academic achievement in Texas by using school-grade level panel data. I find that D. A. T. E. schools obtain significantly higher student achievement gains in reading and math than non-D. A. T. E. schools after the implementation of the program. In addition, D. A. T. E. schools implementing selected school plan obtain greater student achievement gains than those implementing district wide plan. However, the causal effects are found mainly among middle school. Importantly, these findings imply that the teacher incentive program could be an effective policy tool in Texas for developing student performance, but should be cautiously implemented due to the difference in effects according to the U. S. school level. The second section shows that while financial benefit and moral hazard appears to be the <b>main</b> cause of <b>bankruptcy</b> for less educated individuals, well-educated individuals file due to negative income shocks. This is consistent with some evidence suggesting that educated individuals face greater stigma and/or worse information regarding bankruptcy than less-educated individuals. Importantly, these results imply that optimal bankruptcy policy should likely vary across different demographic groups. In the third section, I find that firm size is negatively related to firm growth and positively correlated with firm survivability in the manufacturing industry. R&D investment has a significantly positive effect on firm growth and survivability in the same industry. In the services industry, advertising investment causes a reverse effect on firm growth. This suggests that innovative activities should vary depending on the characteristics of each industry...|$|R
50|$|He first appears {{when he and}} his {{daughter}} Isabella are invited to Oldbuck’s house to meet his new friend Lovel. Wardour, we are told, is a former Jacobite who has become reconciled to the House of Hanover, and is interested in antiquarian research. As they have dinner together they fall out over the question of the Pictish language, Wardour thinking it Celtic and Oldbuck Germanic. Things get so heated that the Wardours call the dinner-party short and walk homeward over the sands of the intervening bay, but the incoming tide cuts them off and threatens to drown them. They are rescued by the combined efforts of their neighbours, and Wardour is bundled off home in a state of exhaustion. When Oldbuck and Lovel next day visit Wardour they find him semi-invalid. It becomes apparent, firstly that there is a romance between Isabella and Lovel which must seemingly be frustrated since Lovel is believed to be illegitimate, and secondly that Wardour hopes to recoup his diminished fortune by prospecting for a lead mine, being encouraged in this project by a suspicious German character called Herman Dousterswivel. Wardour later invites Oldbuck and Lovel to join him in a trip to the ruins of St. Ruth's Priory, and when the day comes the conversation turns to a treasure rumoured to be buried there. One night shortly afterwards Wardour and Dousterswivel are discovered excavating in the grounds of the Priory, the baronet having been persuaded by his companion that he had discovered the site of the treasure by alchemical means, and a small bag of old coins is duly found. Wardour next tries to persuade Oldbuck to invest in a larger-scale excavation. Oldbuck turns down the chance, but persuades him to try the search without making the payments to Dousterswivel that the German insists are necessary. A quantity of silver bullion is uncovered, delighting Wardour and dumbfounding Dousterswivel. After an interval we learn that Wardour has been squandering his new-found money unwisely, while most of his debts remain unpaid. His <b>main</b> creditor institutes <b>bankruptcy</b> proceedings and sends in the bailiffs, but just as Sir Arthur is facing the prospect of a debtors' prison a letter arrives from his son enclosing enough money to pay off the main debt.

40|$|The <b>main</b> {{goals of}} <b>bankruptcy</b> law are to address creditors’ {{coordination}} problems and to efficiently allocate an insolvent debtor’s assets. However, despite these common goals, bankruptcy regulations diverge from State to State. The {{main reason for}} these differences is that most bankruptcy rules have also a redistributive impact upon corporate stakeholders and reflect heterogeneous policy options and voters’ preferences across countries. The economic integration of corporate activities across the borders of sovereign States raises a number of policy issues; indeed, if a corporation has assets and creditors on the territory of different States, {{all of them have}} an interest to govern its insolvency. If originally sovereign States form a federation or a single federal State or entity, bankruptcies can be either governed by each Member State or centralized at the federal level. In this regard, the U. S. and the EU follow two different paths: while in the U. S. bankruptcy law is federalized, in the EU it is governed by Member States. EU law has only unified choice-of-law and choice-of-forum criteria through a Regulation enacted in 2000, according to which, the main insolvency proceeding is governed by the jurisdiction of debtor’s “Centre of Main Interests” (“COMI”). This mechanism was meant to grant legal certainty and to avoid forum shopping, but was conceived in a 'static' world, where corporations could not transfer their headquarters into another Member State and could not reincorporate abroad. This world, however, has collapsed, due to the increasing integration of the European market and the evolution of EU law. Nowadays European corporations have often assets, activities and even their headquarters in Member States different from the State of incorporation and, additionally, can reincorporate from one State to another via cross-border mergers. The consequence is that the EU Regulation is not able to reach its original goals and needs to be amended. The first option is adopt a “choice model” and to allow corporations to choose bankruptcy law and venue they prefer; such model would consent to opt for the fastest and most efficient bankruptcy law, yet it would displace Member States’ power to protect local constituencies through bankruptcy rules and would produce spillover effects. The opposite solution is harmonization of bankruptcy law at EU level: this would internalize all externalities produced by cross-border insolvencies, yet in the EU, differently from the U. S., there is no unified courts’ system and the legislative proceeding, being still based upon mediation between States, is probably not apt to decide on redistributive bankruptcy rules. This debate shows that the choice on power allocation over bankruptcies in the EU depends on the progress of the European integration. At the present stage of this development, bankruptcy rules with redistributive impact are probably better regulated by the law of the State of the COMI or by the State most linked with the involved interests. Yet, the future evolution of the European project may hopefully induce to reconsider this result...|$|R

Los neumáticos o llantas son desechados anualmente en Bogotá sin medir las consecuencias ambientales que esto trae consigo, pues las quemas a cielo abierto de estos materiales y su almacenamiento inadecuado generan altos riesgos para su entorno y el medio ambiente. Además, el manejo inapropiado de llantas es una de las principales razones por la cual pasan a ser obsoletas al poco tiempo de uso. El proceso de fabricación de llantas es muy similar al proceso de cualquier producto, pues en resumen este cuenta con la implementación de sus materias primas, proceso de manufactura, una inspección final y como resultado un producto terminado, que al ser vendido muchas compañías se libran de la disposición final de las llantas. Pero ahí radica un punto a favor para la logística inversa, donde esta buscara la manera de darle un nuevo ciclo de vida a este producto, a través del reciclaje y la reutilización. Mediante esta investigación, se busca captar los principales lugares de acopio de llantas usadas en Bogotá, de manera que estos serán nuestros principales puntos de información para el proyecto, que permita plantear y definir de manera clara estrategias y conclusiones cualitativas.

Tires are discarded annually in Bogotá without considering the environmental consequences that this entails, because the open burning of these materials and their improper storage generate high risks to their surroundings and the environment. In addition, improper handling of tires {{is one of the}} main reasons that become obsolete soon after use. The manufacturing process of tires is very similar to the process of any product, because in all this has the implementation of its raw materials, manufacturing process, final inspection and result in a finished product, which when sold many companies are spared the disposal of tires. But therein lies a plus for reverse logistics, where this look for ways to give new life cycle this product through recycling and reuse. Through this research, it seeks to capture the main gathering places in Bogota used tire, so that these will be our main points of information for the project, which allows raising and clearly define strategies and qualitative conclusions. Demonstrating through internal and external matrices for this sector analysis that the main shortcoming of recycling and reuse of tires is in the way these are collected and stored after use. Starting a collection of data that will lead to raise the supply chain for reverse logistics, showing in turn the different uses and ways of re-manufacturing for tires. Exposing a perspective and different approach to logistics as a means to regulate and reduce waste in the automotive industry, ushering in a new market where its main inputs are products that have already completed their life cycle.

It now reports in January 2006, {{to take into account the}} continued flow of questionnaire responses coming in to CILP. The project as proposed originally consisted of a pilot study questionnaire of three bankruptcy courts in England and Wales (Birmingham, Croydon, and Reading). This number was however expanded during the course of the research to include three further courts (Cardiff, Exeter, and Newcastle). This expansion was deemed necessary so as to gain a greater number of responses to the questionnaire thus giving greater statistical validity to the results. The BCS 2005 project received £ 12, 000 of the research funding. Project Two, which will report in March 2006, received the remaining £ 14, 600. This project is an examination of the concept of phoenixism in insolvency and is being conducted by Fiona Tolmie, director of CILP. REPORT SUMMARY The Main Conclusions of the Bankruptcy Court Survey 2005 (BCS 2005) are: Debtor associated: - The <b>main</b> cause of <b>bankruptcy</b> is bankrupt acknowledged credit misuse, followed by business failure. - Males are the majority users of the bankruptcy regime. - There is no definitive age range for the typical bankrupt. - Debtors present the majority of bankruptcy petitions. - The vast majority of bankrupts are not homeowners prior to bankruptcy. - Bankruptcy does not affect employment. - Knowledge of the Enterprise Act 2002 provisions and their effects is low amongst bankrupts. - The majority of bankrupts feel morally at fault for their debt problems. - A large majority of bankrupts did not know what level of indebtedness they were being released from. Creditor associated: - Bankrupts experience immense difficulties in obtaining bank accounts post discharge, which inhibits them from rehabilitation into the credit world. - The non-monetary effects of bankruptcy are voluminous, but primarily feature dissatisfaction with lenders. Procedure associated: - Informal voluntary arrangements and individual voluntary arrangements are close second choice solutions for over-indebted individuals. - Alternative routes to bankruptcy are explored prior to the bankruptcy route being pursued. - Word of mouth and voluntary sector advice are the main information conduits for personal insolvency advice. - Bankruptcy as an experience is overwhelmingly perceived as negative and stigmatising by bankrupts. - Bankrupts sum up the bankruptcy process as being ultimately an efficient system. - The one year maximum period before automatic discharge is deemed sufficient by bankrupts. Profession/Advice associated: - Communication and advice from Trustees in Bankruptcy is good according to bankrupts. - Communication and advice from the Official Receiver is overwhelmingly good according to bankrupts. - Bankruptcy jurisdiction within the County Courts is efficient and the supporting infrastructure is well maintained. - On the whole lawyers are not involved in the bankruptcy process in terms of advice; the Citizens Advice Bureau is the main provider of personal insolvency advice. Pilot Study Preliminary Recommendations The main recommendations of the BCS 2005 are: - Consider the division of bankruptcy into a two-tier system differentiating between entrepreneurially derived debt and consumer derived debt, perhaps under the headings of "business bankruptcy" and "personal bankruptcy". - Formulate and enact a system of debtor and creditor education. - In light of the recent dramatic growth in consumer debt levels reappraise the conduct of consumer debtors, but in particular lending institutions, focusing on the creditor's responsibility and conduct regarding the consumer debtor's personal over-indebtedness. - Whilst considering the division of the bankruptcy procedure between "business bankruptcy" and "personal bankruptcy" also consider eradicating the term "bankruptcy" for non-culpable consumer debt cases. - It is further recommended that the BCS 2005 pilot study be expanded from its 6 court sample to a full study that encompasses 30 of the 136 bankruptcy courts in England and Wales to give a better impression of the treatment and experience of the bankruptcy court user...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{has been}} {{conducted}} upon a unique and primary database manually collected through courts and various reliable sources (governmental and non-governmental offices). This is the major strength of this thesis. With such a database, we built individual statistics on the corporate bankruptcies process in for two major European countries (France and United Kingdom). The collected data deals with the causes of financial default, the recovery rates of creditors, the process of decision making {{at the time of}} default, the efficiency of such decisions, etc. Such research project helps in distinguishing the origins of corporate financial default: are they independent from the national bankruptcy code or not? In order to test the effect of legal environment, we computed the most comprehensive legal indexes till date. Our legal indexes consist of more than 300 questions that explain the particular function of bankruptcy. We merge these indexes with the hand collected database for France and UK. This makes this thesis really unique as it is composed of original hand collected databases. To {{the best of our knowledge}} the UK database has no equivalence as for the first time we manage to include liquidations which constitute more than 85 % of bankruptcies in UK. Even the scholars in UK lack such information. Such empirical work is completed by a microeconomic theoretical analysis and would yield interesting results that will be discussed in detail in the rest of the chapters of the thesis and also open avenues for future research work. Chapter 1 presents a brief introduction to the topic, explaining the research aims and research methodology. Chapter 2 presents the detailed survey of literature on bankruptcy. It starts by explaining the basic concept associated with bankruptcy, need of <b>bankruptcy</b> laws, the <b>main</b> objective of <b>bankruptcy,</b> the <b>main</b> processes associated with bankruptcy, classification of bankruptcy regimes and the law and finance approach to understand legal environment affecting bankruptcy. It explores the previous literature and findings and provides our contribution to the pre-existing literature and justifies our research goals and our approach. Chapter 3 empirically investigates the choice between informal and formal (court-supervised) restructuring of small and medium French firms in default. The procedure is depicted as a sequential game in which stakeholders first decide whether or not to engage in an informal negotiation. Then, conditional on opting for an informal workout, the creditors and the debtor can succeed or fail in reaching an agreement in order to restructure the firm’s capital structure. Based on a sample of 735 credit lines allocated to 386 French distressed firms, we test different hypotheses which captures i) coordination vs. bargaining power issues, ii) informational problems, iii) firms’ characteristics, and iv) loan characteristics. Using a sequential LOGIT approach, we first find that the probability for opting for an informal workout i) decreases when the bank is the debtor’s main creditor and ii) increases with the size of the loan. In addition, the likelihood of success of an informal workout i) decreases when the management of a badly rated firm is considered as incompetent, and ii) decreases when the bank is the debtor’s main creditor. The result concerning the bank as being the main creditor suggests that “bargaining power” argument dominates the “coordination” argument. Finally, we find no evidence of the impact of collateral on the decision between informal and formal restructuring. Chapter 4 describes the prevalent bankruptcy procedure of UK and France; in general it provides an entire macro view of the bankruptcy laws in given two countries. It presents the various formal and informal procedures, explains their functioning, how they are triggered and the underlying specificities about each process. It is very crucial to understand the working of each procedure as this forms the basis for the future chapters where we related the result of our summary statistics and econometrics to specificities of these procedure and come up with useful conclusions and insights. In chapter 5 the focus returns to the micro economic analysis. We explore the two unique hand coded databases, collected through different sources. Our database consists of 264 small and medium sized enterprises representing France and 564 small and medium sized enterprises representing UK. These countries represent two major legal systems prevailing in Europe: common law and civil law. Both legislations have features that are of interest for research. Based on are datasets we provide summary statistics on both the countries. Our descriptive statistics explains the average profile of our sample company, it provides us with the reasons that lead the company into bankruptcy, it provides us the detailed asset and liability structures of the firms and the detailed claim structure and recovery structure. In addition it also provides us with the duration of the procedure and the costs involved in the process. We also perform multivariate analysis to test the choice between continuation and liquidation for France and to test the factors that increase or decrease the chances of receivership (procedure made for the benefits of banks) and administration (regarded as reorganization procedure) in UK. The main aim of the chapter 6 is to find the legal characteristics that impact on the recovery rates. Previous studies (LLSV, Doing Business Report, World Bank) have usefully used a set of legal indexes to rank the bankruptcy law prevalent within the country. But they fail to identify the characteristics of bankruptcy procedures that create more recoveries. We give here elements of answer by taking into consideration two countries that are good representatives of the two main legal systems prevailing in Europe: France (Civil Law) and United Kingdom (Common Law). To enable this, we built original legal indexes comprising of 158 binary questions that highlight ten major dimensions of corporate bankruptcy procedures: (1) accessibility, (2) exclusivity, (3) bankruptcy costs, (4) production of information, (5) protection of the debtor’s assets, (6) protection of claims, (7) coordination of creditors, (8) decision power, (9) sanction of faulty management, and (10) inclination towards liquidation / reorganization. We then propose a mapping of procedures that shows a clear specialization between them. The French procedures (“redressement judiciaire” and “liquidation judiciaire”) are more protective of the debtor’s assets and favor more the coordination of secured claims, public claims, and unsecured claims. In UK, we find strong opposition between the procedures oriented to liquidation and the other procedures...|$|R

Neretai bankroto sąvoka mokslininkų yra aiškinama kaip per daug didelių įsipareigojimų turėjimas, kada asmuo neturi galimybės patenkinti visų finansinių įsipareigojimų. Vienas iš pagrindinių bankroto bylos proceso dalyvių yra fizinių ar juridinių asmenų bankroto administratorius. Jo kompetencijai priklauso kuo didesne apimtimi patenkinti kreditorinius reikalavimus bei tinkamai pasirūpinti bankrutuojančio fizinio ar juridinio asmens teisėtų interesų apsauga. Po bankroto bylos iškėlimo, bankroto administratorius perima visą skolininko turtą bei asmeninius duomenis, jo prerogatyvoje yra bankroto plano įgyvendinimas, jis tampa svarbiausia grandimi, jungiančia skolininko bei kreditorių teisėtų interesų įgyvendinimo politiką. Bankroto administratorius, vykdydamas jam teisiškai priklausančias užduotis, dalyvauja privačiame asmens gyvenime bei jį suvaržo, siekdamas patenkinti kreditorių interesus. Todėl iškyla klausimas ar bankroto proceso metu nėra pažeidžiama teisė į skolininkų privatumą? Pagrindinis šiame darbe iškeltas tikslas yra išanalizuoti bankroto administratoriaus įgaliojimus tiek fizinių asmenų, tiek juridinių asmenų bankroto procese bei jų santykį su asmens teise į privatumą, privataus gyvenimo neliečiamumą bei konfidencialios informacijos (komercinių ar gamybinių paslapčių) apsaugą. Šis darbas yra sudarytas iš dviejų pagrindinių dalių bei įvado, išvadų ir rekomendacijų. Pirmojoje darbo dalyje yra analizuojama fizinių asmenų teisę į privataus gyvenimo neliečiamumą, įstatymo nustatytas bankroto administratoriaus teises ir pareigas bei jų kolizija. Antrojoje darbo dalyje yra kalbama apie juridinių asmenų bankroto procese bankroto administratoriui suteiktus įgaliojimus, juridinių asmenų konfidencialios informacijos apsaugą bei kreditorių vaidmenį. In {{this paper}} it is {{discussed}} about corporate and personal bankruptcy ant its’ features regarding the executive functions of bankruptcy administrator and his ratio towards creditors and insolvent person himself. Most often the term “Bankruptcy” is interpreted by various authors as the person’s possession of many large-scale commitments, {{when the person}} {{is not able to}} meet all financial obligations. The Republic of Lithuania has in force two fully functional bankruptcy codes: one is regulating bankruptcies of legal entities, and the other – governing personal bankruptcies. In both codes it is declared mandatory condition for the opening of bankruptcy case – the state of insolvency, i. e. person’s or entity’s inability to comply with all their financial obligations. The codes provide various rights and duties regarding the bankruptcy administrator, as well as, regulate the role of the creditors and insolvent person’s or entity’s responsibilities. One of the <b>main</b> roles in <b>bankruptcy</b> process is granted to the natural or legal persons’ bankruptcy administrator. In his competence, bankruptcy administrator has the duty to satisfy creditors’ claims in the widest possible extent, as well as, the obligation {{to take care of the}} insolvent natural or legal person's legitimate interests. After the opening of the bankruptcy case, bankruptcy administrator takes over all the debtor's assets and personal information, the prerogative of the bankruptcy plan implementation falls into his hands, bankruptcy administrator becomes the most important link, connecting the debtor’s and the creditors' legitimate interests implementation. Bankruptcy administrator, by performing the tasks, which the law empowers him to do, involves in a person's life and it restricts, in order to meet the interests of creditors. Therefore, automatically rises question whether the bankruptcy process does not violate the right to privacy? The main objective of this paper is to analyse the powers of bankruptcy administrator in both natural persons’ and legal entities’ bankruptcy proceedings, as well as, their relationship with the civil right to privacy, the right to private life inviolability and sensitive, confidential information’s (commercial or industrial secrets) protection. The uprising problem is urgent and relevant to both natural persons’ and legal entities’ bankruptcy proceedings. During bankruptcy proceedings bankruptcy administrator is an intermediary between the debtor’s and creditors’ interests, he is entrusted with the delicate duty not only to properly manage debtor's assets, but also handle private information regarding insolvent person or entity. After opening bankruptcy case, debtors are required to provide all necessary information including information which is related to his private life. Therefore, it seems that the right to privacy is only applicable until the opening of bankruptcy case – from that moment forward, the right to privacy is conditional. But the problem is mutual, involving both the debtor and the bankruptcy administrator. First of all, in personal bankruptcy process: Whether every time the debtor gets a gift, he must report it to authorities or maybe bankruptcy administrator has to work as private investigator to ensure such process? Secondly, whether bankruptcy administrator's obligation to take over and implement the debtor's assets, or assets to which the debtor has the right, for example, distribution databases that contain private customer information, in order that it would be satisfied creditors’ claims to the greatest possible extent, does not interfere with right to privacy, i. e. whether there are not violated interests of people who are not involved in the bankruptcy process, but their private, sensitive, personal information is passed to third parties in order to meet creditors’ claims? Hence the relevance of the problem is fundamentally important not only for insolvent person, but also for bankruptcy administrators. The relevance of this paper is determined by the fact that there two fully functional bankruptcy codes in which bankruptcy administrators are empowered with specific powers, allowing them to manage the insolvent person’s or entity’s private life. Nevertheless, this topic, regarding scientific perspective, is not widely researched. In the world, especially in the United Stated, it is opposite – it is widely discussed. United States has long history with bankruptcy proceedings, which holds the example of how persons or legal entities have to be treated regarding bankruptcy proceedings, how courts have to take in consideration various aspects of person’s life, how information, which bankruptcy administrator takes over after bankruptcy case is opened, should be handled. The problem arises from both natural and legal persons’ bankruptcy proceedings. In the Republic of Lithuania this subject is discussed much more narrowly, however, the trend is getting more relevant every day. This paper consists of two main parts along with summary, introduction, conclusions and recommendations. The first part of this paper describes individual’s right to privacy, bankruptcy administrator’s rights and duties granted by law, and the conflict between those different rights and duties. The second part is talking about legal entities, their bankruptcy administrator’s powers during bankruptcy process, about legal entities’ right to privacy as in protecting companies’ confidential information and, of course, about the role of creditors during legal entities’ bankruptcy proceeding...|$|R
