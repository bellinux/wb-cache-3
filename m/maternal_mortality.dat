5|$|In 2013 about 289,000 women (800 per day) in {{the world}} died due to pregnancy-related causes, with large {{differences}} between developed and developing countries. <b>Maternal</b> <b>mortality</b> in western nations had been steadily falling, and forms the subject of annual reports and reviews. Yet, between 1987 and 2011, <b>maternal</b> <b>mortality</b> in the United States rose from 7.2 to 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, this {{is reflected in the}} <b>Maternal</b> <b>Mortality</b> Ratio (MMR). By contrast rates as high as 1,000 per birth are reported {{in the rest of the}} world, with the highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which account for 86% of such deaths. These deaths are rarely investigated, yet the World Health Organization considers that 99% of these deaths, the majority of which occur within 24 hours of childbirth, are preventable if the appropriate infrastructure, training, and facilities were in place. In these resource-poor countries, maternal health is further eroded by poverty and adverse economic factors which impact the roads, health care facilities, equipment and supplies in addition to limited skilled personnel. Other problems include cultural attitudes towards sexuality, contraception, child marriage, home birth and the ability to recognise medical emergencies. The direct causes of these maternal deaths are hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, sepsis and unskilled abortion. In addition malaria and AIDS complicate pregnancy. In the period 2003–2009 hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, accounting for 27% of deaths in developing countries and 16% in developed countries.|$|E

TBAs are trusted as they embody the cultural and social life of the community. However, the TBAs’ lack of knowledge and training {{and the use of}} traditional practices have led to risky medical procedures resulting in high <b>maternal</b> <b>mortalities.</b>|$|R

50|$|Contextual determinants: these refer {{primarily}} {{to the influence of}} political commitment--policy formulation, for example--, infrastructure, and women’s socioeconomic status, including education, income, and autonomy. With regards to political will, a highly contested issue is the legalisation of abortion. The current restrictions on abortions has led to many women receiving the procedure illegally and often via untrained staff. These operations have been estimated to contribute to over 30% of <b>maternal</b> <b>mortalities</b> in Kenya.|$|R

5|$|Pregnancy {{presents}} substantial health risks, even {{in developed}} countries, and despite advances in obstetrical science and practice. <b>Maternal</b> <b>mortality</b> remains {{a major problem}} in global health and is considered a sentinel event in judging the quality of health care systems. Adolescent pregnancy represents a particular problem, whether intended or unintended, and whether within marriage or a union or not. Pregnancy results in major changes in a girl's life, physically, emotionally, socially and economically and jeopardises her transition into adulthood. Adolescent pregnancy, more often than not, stems from a girl's lack of choices. or abuse. Child marriage (see below) is a major contributor worldwide, since 90% of births to girls aged 15–19 occur within marriage.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, the United Nations created Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 {{to improve}} {{maternal}} health. Target 5A sought to reduce <b>maternal</b> <b>mortality</b> by three quarters from 1990 to 2015, using two indicators, 5.1 the MMR and 5.2 {{the proportion of}} deliveries attended by skilled health personnel (physician, nurse or midwife). Early reports indicated MDG 5 had made the least progress of all MDGs. By the target date of 2015 the MMR had only declined by 45%, from 380 to 210, most of which occurred after 2000. However this improvement occurred across all regions, but the highest MMRs were still in Africa and Asia, although South Asia witnessed the largest fall, from 530 to 190 (64%). The smallest decline {{was seen in the}} developed countries, from 26 to 16 (37%). In terms of assisted births, this proportion had risen globally from 59 to 71%. Although the numbers were similar for both developed and developing regions, there were wide variations in the latter from 52% in South Asia to 100% in East Asia. The risks of dying in pregnancy in developing countries remains fourteen times higher than in developed countries, but in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the MMR is highest, the risk is 175 times higher. In setting the MDG targets, skilled assisted birth was considered a key strategy, but also an indicator of access to care and closely reflect mortality rates. There are also marked differences within regions with a 31% lower rate in rural areas of developing countries (56 vs. 87%), yet there is no difference in East Asia but a 52% difference in Central Africa (32 vs. 84%). With the completion of the MDG campaign in 2015, new targets are being set for 2030 under the Sustainable Development Goals campaign. Maternal health is placed under Goal 3, Health, with the target being to reduce the global <b>maternal</b> <b>mortality</b> ratio to less than 70. Amongst tools being developed to meet these targets is the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist.|$|E
5|$|In archaeology, {{the study}} of {{mortuary}} context, that is, {{the interpretation of the}} postmortem treatment of the dead, whether an individual or as pertains to patterns within a group, has {{led to the development of}} hypotheses on social status and/or hierarchy regarding many cultures, ancient and extant. In addition, the determination of whether or not delivery actually occurred prior to death has a bearing on analyses of the mother's population, as the concentration of trace elements differ markedly between the skeletons of prepartum adult women (before giving birth) and women who are lactating; the identification of coffin birth would lead to more accurate analyses of the number of lactating women in a population or the rate of <b>maternal</b> <b>mortality.</b> It is therefore necessary for investigators to be able to recognize postmortem fetal extrusion when encountered in an excavated burial.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{barriers}} to access, health services {{have shown a}} trend toward improvement {{over the past twenty}} years. Child immunizations against such diseases as hepatitis B, diphtheria and measles increased an average of 60percent in this period, indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8percent in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth. In 2010 the <b>maternal</b> <b>mortality</b> rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup. The infant mortality rate in 2011 was 41 per 1,000 births, with an under-five mortality rate at 61 per 1,000 births. Schistosomiasis, malaria and sexually transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar, although infection rates of AIDS remain low relative to many countries in mainland Africa, at only 0.2percent of the adult population. The malaria mortality rate is also among the lowest in Africa at 8.5 deaths per 100,000people, in part due to the highest frequency use of insecticide treated nets in Africa. Adult life expectancy in 2009 was 63 years for men and 67years for women.|$|E
50|$|The WHO {{lists the}} {{leading causes of}} {{maternal}} death as severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy, obstructed labor, and unsafe abortions. These causes compose approximately 80 percent of all <b>maternal</b> <b>mortalities</b> worldwide with the vast majority occurring in developing countries. The other remaining {{factors that contribute to}} maternal death include malaria, anemia, and HIV/AIDS during pregnancy. The WHO also states that the reasons why so many women die during childbirth are usually poverty, long distance to care, lack of information, inadequate service, and cultural practices. All of these causes of maternal death, and the corresponding reasons, are very familiar among women in Angola.|$|R
40|$|Background: Measuring and {{monitoring}} progress towards Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 4 and 5 requires {{valid and reliable}} estimates of <b>maternal</b> and neonatal <b>mortality.</b> In South Africa, there are conflicting reports on the estimates of <b>maternal</b> and neonatal <b>mortality,</b> derived from both direct and indirect estimation techniques. This study aims to systematically review the estimates made of <b>maternal</b> and neonatal <b>mortality</b> in the period from 1990 to 2015 in South Africa and determine trends over this period. Methods: For {{the purpose of this}} review, searches for eligible studies will be conducted in MEDLINE, Africa-Wide Information, African Index Medicus, African Journals Online, Scopus, Web of Science and CINAHL databases. Searches will be restricted to articles written in English and presenting data covering the period between 1990 and 2015. Reference lists of retrieved articles will also be screened for additional publications. Three independent reviewers will be involved in the study selection, data extractions and achieving consensus. Study quality and risk of bias will thereafter be assessed by two authors. The results will be presented as rates/ratio with their corresponding 95 % confidence/uncertainty intervals. Discussion: Identifying trends in <b>maternal</b> and neonatal <b>mortality</b> will help to track progress in MDGs 4 and 5 and will serve in evaluating interventions focusing on reducing <b>maternal</b> and child <b>mortality</b> in the country.
