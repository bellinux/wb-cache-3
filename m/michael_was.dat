His mother went into labour with him while driving, so his partially sighted father took over the wheel but crashed the car into a lamp post {{on the way to}} the hospital; <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> delivered in the back seat. The Armstrong family moved to Ballymun, Dublin, and, when <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> age nine, to Manchester, England.|$|E

5|$|Benn's {{father had}} been created Viscount Stansgate in 1942 when Winston Churchill {{increased}} the number of Labour peers to aid political work in the House of Lords; at this time, Benn's elder brother <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> intending to enter the priesthood and had no objections to inheriting a peerage. However, <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> later killed in an accident while on active service in the Second World War, and this left Benn as the heir to the peerage. He made several unsuccessful attempts to renounce the succession.|$|E

5|$|His {{rule over}} Wallachia {{began in the}} autumn of 1593. Two years later, war with the Ottomans began, a {{conflict}} in which the Prince fought the Battle of Călugăreni, {{considered one of the most}} important battles of his reign. Although the Wallachians emerged victorious from the battle, <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> forced to retreat with his troops and wait for aid from his allies, Prince Sigismund Báthory of Transylvania and Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. The war continued until a peace finally emerged in January 1597, but this lasted for only a year and a half. Peace was again reached in late 1599, when <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> unable to continue the war due to lack of support from his allies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> almost 16 {{when his}} father fell fatally ill; the annual trip to Denmark was cancelled. On 1 November 1894, Alexander III died at the {{untimely}} age of 49. Michael's eldest brother, Nicholas, became Tsar, and Michael's childhood was effectively over.|$|E
5|$|<b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> heir {{presumptive}} until 12 August 1904, when {{the birth of}} Tsarevich Alexei to Nicholas and Alexandra provided an heir apparent. Michael again became second-in-line to the throne, but was named as co-regent for the boy, along with Alexandra, {{in the event of}} Nicholas's death.|$|E

50|$|Devon visits Michael and convinces him to {{join the}} project, but <b>Michael</b> <b>is</b> furious that KITT has <b>been</b> dismantled. <b>Michael</b> <b>is</b> ready to walk away, but later decides to rebuild KITT's AI unit, which he finds {{difficult}} since Maddock has sold most of KITT's technology to medical research. <b>Michael</b> <b>is</b> able to reactivate KITT's logic module and installs him in the dashboard of his 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air.|$|R
5|$|Michael's cousin, Dan, then laid {{claim to}} Wallachia. Many of Michael's boyars (including the {{influential}} Albul and Utmeș) defected to the pretender. Dan crossed into Wallachia in early 1420. Initially, <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> able to resist, {{but since he}} had failed to implement all provisions of his 1419 treaty with the Ottoman Empire, his cousin was able to obtain military assistance from the Ottomans. Michael received support from Hungary, but their united forces were routed in the summer of 1420. <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> killed on the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 1916, Michael's corps was {{involved}} in the Brusilov Offensive. The Guards Army suffered heavy losses under the incompetent leadership of Michael's uncle, Grand Duke Paul, who was removed from command. In contrast, <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> awarded a second gallantry medal, the Order of St. Vladimir with Swords, for his part in actions against the enemy and was belatedly made an adjutant-general. The poor progress of the war and their almost constant separation depressed both Michael and Natalia. <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> still suffering from stomach ulcers and, in October 1916, he was ordered to take leave in the Crimea.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Michael</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} the straight {{man in the}} series. However, creator Mitch Hurwitz says that in some respects <b>Michael</b> <b>is</b> [...] "the craziest one" [...] in that he cannot see much of what happens around him.|$|R

5|$|A second church, also {{dedicated}} to St <b>Michael,</b> <b>was</b> built of local sandstone in the 14th century by the Abbot Adam of Sodbury, incorporating {{the foundations of}} the previous building. It included stained glass and decorated floor tiles. There was also a portable altar of Purbeck Marble; {{it is likely that the}} Monastery of St Michael on the Tor was a daughter house of Glastonbury Abbey. In 1243 Henry III granted a charter for a six-day fair at the site.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War {{the canal}} {{remained}} {{in a state}} of limbo – with minimal maintenance by the railway company – and was the haunt of fishermen and walkers. The Conservators continued their annual inspections, and the infrastructure remained in remarkably good order, compared to many other closed canals. The section near Creech St <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> even used for swimming lessons for the local school children in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Michael returned to Russia, assuming command of a cavalry regiment. When Nicholas abdicated on , <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> named as his successor instead of Alexei. Michael, however, deferred acceptance of the throne until ratification by an elected assembly. He was never confirmed as Emperor and, following the Russian Revolution of 1917, he was imprisoned and murdered.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory to}} the corpse's identity was {{suggested in the}} history The Secrets of HMS Dasher (2004). This suggested that in March 1943 {{there was an explosion}} on , which sank, killing 379 men; one of these corpses was purportedly used. The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion, and observes that the official records of the operation state that <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> the body.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his birth, his {{paternal}} grandfather Alexander II was still the reigning Emperor of All the Russias. <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> fourth-in-line to the throne after his father and elder brothers Nicholas and George. After the assassination of his grandfather in 1881, he became third-in-line and, in 1894 {{after the death of his}} father, second-in-line. George died in 1899, leaving Michael as heir presumptive.|$|E
5|$|Boyars {{could no}} longer be {{executed}} without the knowledge and approval of the Transylvanian Prince and, if convicted for treason, their fortunes {{could no longer}} be confiscated. Apparently <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said in a conversation with the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: …they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but as their own good required and obtained privileges for themselves. He would try to avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E

5|$|During late 1596, <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> {{faced with}} an {{unexpected}} attack from the Tatars, who had destroyed the towns of Bucharest and Buzău. By the time Michael gathered his army to counterattack, the Tatars had speedily retreated and so no battle was fought. <b>Michael</b> <b>was</b> determined to continue {{the war against the}} Ottomans, but he was prevented because he lacked support from Sigismund Báthory and Rudolf II. On 7 January 1597 Hasan Pasha declared the independence of Wallachia under Michael's rule, but Michael knew that this was only an attempt to divert him from preparing for another future attack. Michael again requested Rudolf II's support and Rudolf finally agreed to send financial assistance to the Wallachian ruler. On 9 June 1598 a formal treaty was reached between Michael and Rudolf II. According to the treaty, the Austrian ruler would give Wallachia sufficient money to maintain a 5,000-man army, as well as armaments and supplies. Shortly after the treaty was signed, the war with the Ottomans resumed and Michael besieged Nicopolis on 10 September 1598 and took control of Vidin. The war with the Ottomans continued until 26 June 1599, when Michael, lacking the resources and support to continue prosecuting the war, signed a peace treaty.|$|E

5|$|Michael began {{negotiating}} with the Emperor over his official position in Transylvania. The latter wanted the principality under direct Imperial rule with Michael acting as governor. The Wallachian voivode, on the other hand, wanted the title of Prince of Transylvania for himself and equally claimed the Partium region. <b>Michael</b> <b>was,</b> nevertheless, willing to acknowledge Habsburg overlordship.|$|E
