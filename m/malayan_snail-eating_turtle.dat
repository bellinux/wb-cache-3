40|$|Members of {{the genus}} Malayemys, <b>Malayan</b> <b>snail-eating</b> <b>turtles,</b> are small batagurid turtles {{reaching}} maximum sizes of 22 cm carapace length (Srinarumol, 1995). They have dark brown to mahogany carapaces with three discontinuous keels, yellow plastra with large dark blotches on each scute, and large black heads adorned with yellow or cream-colored stripes that extend onto their necks (Ernst et al., 2000). Malayemys inhabit lowland freshwater habitats throughout Southeast Asia including ponds, canals, streams, swamps, marshes and wet rice fields. These are diurnal bottom dwellers that feed primarily on mollusks (Smith, 1931; Taylor, 1970; Nutaphand, 1979; Srinarumol, 1995; Ernst et al., 2000; van Dijk and Thirakhupt, in press). Populations of Malayemys {{can be found in}} virtually all lowland areas of central Thailand, where they are the most commonly found wild turtle (van Dijk and Thirakupt, in press). Population status outside of central Thailand is poorly documented. Members of this genus are presumed to be abundant in southern Vietnam (Bourret, 1939; Geissler and Jungnickel, 1989; van Dijk and Thirakhupt, in press), less abundant in peninsular Thailand (van Dijk and Thirakhupt, in press), and rare on Java (van Dijk and Thirakhupt, in press; Peter C. H. Pritchard, pers. com.). Many Southeast Asian turtle species are in rapid decline because of serious pressure from commercial exploitation and habitat destruction (Behler, 1997; Thirakhupt and van Dijk, 1997; van Dijk et al., 2000). Improved legislation and enforcement, community education, population monitoring, and life history studies are all crucial to the long-term survival of most of these species. None of this can occur, however, without detailed records on the geographic distribution of these organisms. This paper presents a detailed table and map that clearly define the geographic distribution of turtles in the genus Malayemys. No other account is based on such a complete compilation of data...|$|R
40|$|<b>Snail-eating</b> <b>turtle</b> egg Chemical {{compositions}} Whole egg Egg White Egg yolk This {{study was}} designed to determine the chemical compositions and profiles of amino acid,fatty acid, vitamin, mineral and sex hormone contents of <b>snail-eating</b> <b>turtle</b> eggs. Average proximate analyses of weight, ash, moisture, carbohydrate, protein, fat and total calories of the <b>snail-eating</b> <b>turtle</b> whole eggs were 11. 55 g egg- 1, 1. 45 g 100 g- 1, 72. 93 g 100 g- 1, 4. 64 g 100 g- 1, 12. 42 g 100 g- 1, 8. 56 g 100 g- 1, 145. 17 kcal 100 g- 1 respectively. Most of these nutrients were higher in egg yolks than egg white except moisture. Most of non-essential fatty acid (NEFA) was oleic acid (2. 65 mg 100 g- 1) while most of essential fatty acid (EFA) was arachidonic acid (0. 47 mg 100 g- 1). <b>Snail-eating</b> <b>turtle</b> eggs contained high ash (1. 45 g 100 g- 1) which was related to mineral content. Our results also revealed that whole eggs had high essential mineral of nitrogen and trace mineral of iron and zinc, which most of them were in egg white, In addition, it contained high vitamin A (retinol) and E in egg yolk. Most of sex hormones content, such as Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Prolactin (PRL), Progesterone (P), Estradiol (E 2) and Testosterone (T), were higher in egg yolk than in egg white, with the highest of progesterone. This study indicated that <b>snail-eating</b> <b>turtle</b> eggs contained high contents of some essential amino acid, such as arachidonic acid and linoleic acid, vitamin A, total minerals of nitrogen, iron and zinc and sex hormone progesterone...|$|R
50|$|The Mekong <b>snail-eating</b> <b>turtle</b> (Malayemys subtrijuga) is {{a species}} of turtle in the Geoemydidae family. It was {{monotypic}} within the genus Malayemys until Brophy (2004, 2005) revalidated (based on morphology) Malayemys macrocephala (Gray, 1859) long time {{considered to be a}} synonym of M. subtrijuga.|$|R
50|$|Ang Trapaing Thmor {{sanctuary}} is also {{an important}} conservation area for a number of other threatened species. One globally threatened primate species, the long tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) is found within the sanctuary. One globally threatened ungulate species—the Eld's deer (Rucervus eldii)—and three globally threatened turtle species—the Asian box turtle (Cuora amboinensis), the <b>Malayan</b> <b>snail-eating</b> <b>turtle</b> (Malayemys subtrijuga), and the elongated tortoise (Indotestudo elongata)—are also found within Ang Trapaing Thmor.|$|E
40|$|Allometry, sexual dimorphism, and {{geographic}} variation were {{studied in the}} <b>Malayan</b> <b>snail-eating</b> <b>turtle,</b> Malayemys subtrijuga (Schlegel and Müller, 1844), using regression and discriminant function analyses. Allometry was evident in M. subtrijuga from the Chao Phraya River Basin. Shell shape changed in males as carapace length increased more than shell width and height, whereas females showed proportional changes. This difference in allometric growth yielded sexually dimorphic adults. Females attained larger sizes and had relatively wider and higher shells than males. Discriminant function analysis of shell and head-stripe characters revealed a clear pattern of geographic variation that {{was consistent with the}} topography of Southeast Asia and the poor dispersal abilities of these turtles. Two morphologically distinct groups of Malayemys occur allopatrically in lowland areas of mainland Southeast Asia, and each requires recognition as a distinct species. Turtles from the Mekong River Basin retain the name Malayemys subtrijuga (Schlegel and Müller, 1844), whereas those from the Chao Phraya and Mae Khlong basins, coastal areas of southeastern Thailand, and the Malay Peninsula are assigned the name Malayemys macrocephala (Gray, 1859). Both species are potentially threatened by overcollection and habitat destruction, and should be protected separately. Finally, discriminant function analysis of shell and head-stripe characters suggested that M. subtrijuga on Java were derived from the Mekong River Basin...|$|E
50|$|The Mekong <b>snail-eating</b> <b>turtle</b> {{is found}} in the Mekong River basin of Cambodia, Laos, {{southern}} Vietnam, and northeastern Thailand. Introduced in Java, Indonesia. The occurrence of the species in Indonesia is regarded by Brophy (2005) to be allochtonous, i.e., non-native (Sumatra) or extinct (Java).|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a <b>snail-eating</b> <b>turtle,</b> Malayemys isan sp. nov., from the Mekong River Basin in northeastern Thailand (Nong Bua Lamphu, Nong Khai and Udon Thani provinces) and the adjacent Vientiane area in Laos. The new species is readily distinguishable from M. subtrijuga by its two (vs. six to nine) nasal stripes, and from both M. subtrijuga and M. macrocephala by its thin, often discontinuous, infraorbital stripe that never reaches the loreal seam. This geographically-restricted new species {{is sold in}} several food markets throughout the species‟ distribution and is in urgent need of conservation measures...|$|R
40|$|Based on an {{integrative}} taxonomic approach, {{we examine}} the differentiation of Southeast Asian <b>snail-eating</b> <b>turtles</b> using information from 1863 bp of mitochondrial DNA, 12 microsatellite loci, morphology and a correlative species distribution model. Our analyses reveal three genetically distinct groups with limited mitochondrial introgression in one group. All three groups exhibit distinct nuclear gene pools and distinct morphology. Two of these groups correspond to the previously recognized species Malayemys macrocephala (Chao Phraya Basin) and M. subtrijuga (Lower Mekong Basin). The third and genetically most divergent group from the Khorat Basin represents a previously unrecognized species, which is described herein. Although Malayemys are extensively traded and used for religious release, only few studied turtles appear to be translocated by humans. Historic fluctuations in potential distributions were assessed using species distribution models (SDMs). The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) projection of the predictive SDMs suggests two distinct glacial distribution ranges, implying that the divergence of M. macrocephala and M. subtrijuga occurred in allopatry and was triggered by Pleistocene climate fluctuations. Only the projection derived from the global circulation model MIROC reveals a distinct third glacial distribution range for the newly discovered Malayemys species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Organochlorine {{pesticides}} (OCPs) {{are known}} to be persistent and bioaccumulative toxicants that may cause reproductive impairments in wildlife as well as human. The current study uses the <b>snail-eating</b> <b>turtle</b> Malayemys macrocephala, a long-lived animal commonly distribute in rice field habitat in central part of Thailand, as a sentinel to monitor OCP contamination in environment. The nest soil, complete clutch of eggs, and blood of the turtle were collected from agricultural areas in the Chao Phraya River Basin, Thailand during the nesting season of 2007 - 2008. The novel methods for tissue extraction by an accelerated solvent extractor (ASE, for egg) and liquid-liquid extraction (for blood) have been developed. The nineteen OCP residues were analyzed by gas chromatography with micro-electron captured detector (GC-µECD). The validated methods have met requirements of the AOAC standard. The results indicated that significant amounts of OCPs are still contaminated in nest soil and eggs of the turtle even though the OCPs had been banned in this area for many years. This suggested the potential risk to health of wildlife as well as human in the area. Keywords—Gas chromatography, persistent organic pollutants, rice field, sentinel species.
