By {{the end of}} 1985, Geodat had delivered twenty million data points and 750 map sheets in the 1:50,000 to 1:250,000 scale range. [...] Alongside mainstream production for the project sponsors, the Geodat project produced a complete digital {{map of the world}} at a scale of 1:1,000,000, MundoCart, in 1985. [...] MundoCart was based on digitisation of paper prints of the United States Defense Mapping Agency's (DMA) Operational Navigation Chart (ONC) 1:1,000,000 scale paper map series, produced by the USA, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. ONC charts were designed {{to meet the needs of}} pilots and air crews in medium-and low-altitude navigation and to support <b>military</b> <b>operational</b> <b>planning,</b> intelligence briefings, and other needs. Some 270 1:1million maps, plus six 1:2million maps for Antarctica, resulted in 30 million data points. MundoCart provided numerous commercial and academic Geographic information system (GIS) users with their first complete vector map of the world. The data was sold, along with a complete set of FORTRAN mapping software, by Petroconsultants (CES), a UK subsidiary of Petroconsultants SA, subsequently sold to IHS in 1996, that sponsored the project.|$|E

To counteract a regional war, military agreements with Israel were signed on February 24 and [...] August 26, 1996. These agreements followed with intelligence cooperation in February 1997. Two diplomatic notes were issued during 1996. The first note was for a truck originating in Iran and carrying military equipment to the PKK in Syria. The second one was regarding Syria being a state sponsor of the PKK. Turkey delinked the two issues of water and the PKK. On December 30, 1996, Turkish National Intelligence Agency (MIT) smuggled Mustafa Duyur out of Syria. Duyur was a DHKP-C agent who was involved with the Özdemir Sabancı murder.

40|$|Abstract-In {{this paper}} we learn {{indicators}} from simulated data {{that serve as}} boundaries on <b>military</b> <b>operational</b> <b>plans</b> of an expeditionary operation. These are boundaries that an operation must not move beyond without risk of drastic failure. We receive simulated and evaluated partial patterns of plan instances from a simulation-based decision support system that are patterns of integer strings. These partial patterns are clustered by an unsupervised neural Potts spin clustering method into clusters where the instances in each cluster have similar characteristics and outcomes. This gives all partial patterns a classification. We use a Dempster-Shafer theory based factor screening method on each pair of clusters, where all activities of the plan are evaluated as to their differentiating capacity between {{the two sets of}} partial plan instances. All plan instances are projected from their full integer string representation to a subset of factors with high differentiating capacity. We apply supervised learning by Support Vector Machine using the previous classification to learn support vectors for each pair of clusters given the projected plan instances of these clusters. From these support vectors we derive a lower dimension hyper plane that will serve as one of the indicators. One indicator from each pair of clusters will make up a full set of indicators for this <b>operational</b> <b>plan.</b> This set of indicators can be provided to the intelligence service and used during execution of the plan for assessment of its progress, and serve as a warning bell if the plan approaches an indicator which it should not proceed beyond.

40|$|Military {{logistics}} {{planning is}} a complex process, involving many calculations, satisfaction of constraints, and cooperation amongst many organisational entities that provide services {{in order to achieve}} military logistics goals. Multi-Agent Logistics Tool (MALT) is a project aimed at supporting military logistics planning. MALT is being developed using agent technology, where agents represent the organisations within the logistics domain, and model their logistics functions, processes, expertise, and interactions with other organisations. Agents are a suitable technology for modelling organisations within MALT, due to the similarity in characteristics between organisations and agents. A component of MALT was implemented within DARPA's Coalition Agent Experiment (CoAX) project. We discuss the CoAX implementation of MALT, and lessons learnt. We discovered that implementing a centralised agent planning approach within MALT, and hence the decentralised <b>military</b> (<b>operational)</b> logistics <b>planning</b> domain, may not always be appropriate, and that a decentralised agent planning approach may be more suitable. Some of our observations regarding the future of agents for military logistics planning are discussed...|$|R

The other pincer was landed by short takeoff and landing aircraft at San Tiau, southeast of Route 7. This makeshift force was made up of Military Region 4's battalion-sized 2nd Special Guerrilla Unit, Military Region 2's Bataillon Volontaires 27 (Volunteer Battalion 27), plus some ADC guerrillas.

50|$|Clausewitz {{introduced}} systematic philosophical contemplation into Western military thinking, {{with powerful}} implications {{not only for}} historical and analytical writing but also for practical policy, <b>military</b> instruction, and <b>operational</b> <b>planning.</b> He relied on his own experiences, contemporary writings about Napoleon, and on deep historical research. His historiographical approach is evident in his first extended study, written when he was 25, of the Thirty Years War. He rejects the Enlightenment's view of the war as a chaotic muddle and instead explains its drawn-out operations by the economy and technology of the age, the social characteristics of the troops, and the commanders' politics and psychology. In On War, Clausewitz sees all wars as the sum of decisions, actions, and reactions in an uncertain and dangerous context, and also as a socio-political phenomenon. He also stressed the complex nature of war, which encompasses both the socio-political and the operational and stresses the primacy of state policy.|$|R
40|$|The {{industrial}} chemical {{health threat}} to the US military is growing. The increasing threat is due both to the more frequent use of industrial chemicals and infrastructure as weapons of war and opportunity, and to recent military operations in urban and industrial environments where accidents or terrorism may cause large-scale chemical releases. Using traditional single-scenario modeling techniques, {{it is difficult to}} prospectively portray the complex array of potential chemical hazards associated with specific release scenarios, but some characterization of the potential chemical concentrations and areas affected is clearly an important consideration for all phases of <b>military</b> <b>operational</b> and medical <b>planning.</b> This paper discusses a technique for evaluating the risks associated with chemical hazards from large-scale chemical releases, and describes a process of statistical interpretation of iterative dispersion analyses that was created to permit improved quantification of the hazards. The technique allows thousands of hypothetical releases of toxic material to be statistically combined and assessed to allow graphical representation of the statistics for the potential hazard areas where pre-determined exposure guidelines for the chemical may be exceeded...|$|R
40|$|Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {{can provide}} {{significant}} contributions to information gathering in military missions. UAVs {{can be used to}} capture both full motion video and still imagery of specific target locations within the area of interest. In order to improve the effectiveness of a reconnaissance mission, it is important to visit the largest number of interesting target locations possible, taking into consideration operational constraints related to fuel usage between target locations, weather conditions and endurance of the UAV. We model this planning problem as the well-known orienteering problem, which is a generalization of the traveling salesman problem. Given the uncertainty in the <b>military</b> <b>operational</b> environment, robust <b>planning</b> solutions are required. As such, our model takes into account uncertainty in the fuel usage between targets (for instance due to weather conditions) as well as uncertainty in the importance of visiting specific target locations. We report results using different uncertainty sets that specify the degree of uncertainty against which any feasible solution will be protected. We also compare the probability that a solution is feasible for the robust solution on one hand and the solution found with average fuel usage and expected value of information on the other. In doing so, we show how the sustainability of a UAV mission can be significantly improved...|$|R
