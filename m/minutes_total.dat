500|$|Because of {{the delays}} in the mission and the {{inoperative}} fuel transfer pump, the B-29 did not have sufficient fuel to reach the emergency landing field at Iwo Jima, so Sweeney flew the aircraft to Okinawa. Arriving there, he circled for 20 minutes trying to contact the control tower for landing clearance, finally concluding that his radio was faulty.

With only enough fuel for one landing attempt, Sweeney and Albury brought Bockscar in at [...] instead of the normal , firing distress flares to alert the field of the uncleared landing. The number two engine died from fuel starvation as Bockscar began its final approach. Touching the runway hard, the heavy B-29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control. The B-29's reversible propellers were insufficient to slow the aircraft adequately, and with both pilots standing on the brakes, Bockscar made a swerving 90-degree turn {{at the end of the}} runway to avoid running off the runway. A second engine died from fuel exhaustion by the time the plane came to a stop.
