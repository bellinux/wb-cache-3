And then <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>died</b> and I sort of {{realized}} that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|E

2500|$|On 4 December 2014, Usmanov paid $4.9m for Dr James Watson's Nobel Prize Medal in Physiology or Medicine, {{which was}} {{auctioned}} at Christie's in New York City. Watson was selling his prize {{to raise money}} to support scientific research. After auctions fees, Watson received $4.1m. Usmanov subsequently returned the medal to Watson, stating [...] "in my opinion, a situation in which an outstanding scientist sells a medal recognizing his achievements is unacceptable. Watson's work contributed to cancer research, the illness from which <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>died.</b> It is important for me that the money that I spent on this medal will go to supporting scientific research, and the medal will stay with the person who deserved it." ...|$|E

He {{was the last of}} a generation who did not take medication - not even an aspirin - but relied on sport to keep him fit. [...] Indeed, his love of all sport is what drove him and he retained right up until his death the ability to catch a ball lobbed wildly at him without warning from his grand-children. He played golf and tennis right up until his death and I am sure that had he used a little less lard whilst frying sausages, he would easily have made it to 100.

2500|$|Ullman credits {{her sense}} of humour to a feeling of both classlessness {{as well as her}} mother's working class roots. [...] "It comes from being classless, I think.
