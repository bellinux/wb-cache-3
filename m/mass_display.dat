25|$|It has {{its origins}} in early NDPs as various <b>mass</b> <b>display</b> items put up by {{community}} groups or schools to add colour to the otherwise military parade. These items revolved around the themes of racial harmony, ruggedness among youths etc., which are represented by ethnic dances and mass gymnastics displays. This section evolved {{over the years to}} become more theatrical, from the massive flashcard displays that complemented the parade in the 1980s to multimedia projections in recent Shows.|$|E
25|$|Sentosa Balloon Hat Festival {{began in}} 2004. It is a {{gathering}} of local secondary school bands who would do display marches from Tanjong Beach to Palawan Beach before a <b>mass</b> <b>display</b> event. The participants would wear balloon hats made by themselves and each school comes {{up with their own}} unique design. At the end of the event, all the students would pop their balloons followed by the releasing {{of a large number of}} balloons into the air. The event began as part of an attempt to create the world record for the gathering of the largest number of balloon hats. It was discontinued after 2006.|$|E
25|$|The commandos are {{a regular}} {{feature in the}} SAF's major parades and events, such as the annual Singapore Armed Forces Military Tattoo and the Singapore Armed Forces Day Parade. They also appear in various {{national}} events, including the National Day Parade, where they form {{one of the four}} guard of honour contingents after winning the Best Combat Unit awards in the preceding year. They have appeared in various <b>mass</b> <b>display</b> segments, often by displaying their rappelling skills. The commandos have also served as the guard of honour for important visitors to the Istana, but they are increasingly replaced by the Military Police due to the irrelevance of the task to their official duties.|$|E
50|$|On {{occasion}} {{early in}} the breeding season, <b>mass</b> <b>displays</b> erupt, where twenty or thirty birds perform the various wing-spreading displays, short flights, and constant calling. Displaying birds are attacked by others, and groups of silent but agitated birds watch the interactions. <b>Mass</b> <b>displays</b> are {{more common in the}} early morning, can last for up to 40 minutes, and seem to be a combination of sexual and agonistic behaviour.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of bubble spacetimes in vacuum and electrovac scenarios by numerical means. We find strong evidence against the formation of naked singularities in (i) scenarios with negative <b>masses</b> <b>displaying</b> initially collapsing conditions and (ii) scenarios with negative <b>masses</b> <b>displaying</b> initially expanding conditions, previously reported to give rise to such singularities. Additionally, we show {{that the presence of}} strong gauge fields implies that an initially collapsing bubble bounces back and expands. By fine-tuning the strength of the gauge field we find that the solution approaches a static bubble solution. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
500|$|The closing {{ceremony}} of the Games {{was held on}} 26 August at The Float@Marina Bay. The show began proper at 8pm Singapore time with youths, cheerleaders and the YOG mascots Lyo and Merly dancing to a medley of [...] "Fame" [...] and [...] "Fight for This Love". Following the arrival of IOC President Jacques Rogge and Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong, 12-year-old Nathania Ong led the choir and the audience in singing the national anthem of Singapore. In the next segment [...] "Blazing the Trail", 5 young singers performed an upbeat song while students dressed to resemble the [...] "Spirit of Youth", the Singapore 2010 emblem, performed a <b>mass</b> <b>display</b> item. Following the item, the athletes and the flags representing all competing nations made their way onto the floating platform.

500|$|On 30 August 1942, as a pre-emptive measure, {{the newly}} arrived Japanese Commander General Shimpei Fukuye wanted the wholly British and Australian POWs interned at Selarang Barracks in Changi {{to sign a}} [...] "No Escape Pledge" [...] after the {{recapture}} of four escaped prisoners from Changi Prison earlier. The four escapees were Australian Corporal Rodney Breavington and Private Victor Gale, and English soldiers, Private Harold Waters and Private Eric Fletcher. The pledge reads: [...] "I the undersigned, hereby solemnly swear on my honour that I will not, under any circumstances, attempt to escape." [...] With three exceptions, everyone refused to sign, because the prisoners saw it as their duty to escape if they could. Under the Geneva Convention, POWs {{had the right to}} attempt to escape and they were not supposed to be punished if they were recaptured. However, at that time, Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention. General Fukuye was furious at the <b>mass</b> <b>display</b> of insubordination and the following day he ordered all prisoners, except the three who had agreed to sign, to congregate at the parade square in Selarang Barracks. What ensued was to become known as the [...] "Selarang Barracks Incident".|$|E
2500|$|With Singapore's Independence {{after its}} {{separation}} from Malaysia in 1965, manpower consideration assumed top priority in education planning. The emphasis on technical training and post-secondary education led to GESS {{being singled out}} as a centre for Technical Training and a Pre-University centre in 1970. In 1982, GESS was chosen to participate in its first <b>mass</b> <b>display</b> item titled Singapore [...] - [...] Past, Present and Future inspired by the Star Wars movie, featured interesting movement danced to the theme music of the movie. GESS participated at the Singapore Youth Festival during the mid year, followed by the National Day celebrations in August and in 1983, at the Opening Ceremony when Singapore played host to the 12th Southeast Asian Games at the National Stadium.|$|E
