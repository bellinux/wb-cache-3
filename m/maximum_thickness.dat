In {{contrast}} to the British focus on increasing speed and firepower, Germany progressively improved the armour and staying power of their ships to better the British battlecruisers. Von der Tann, begun in 1908 and completed in 1910, carried eight 11.1-inch guns, but with 11.1-inch (283mm) armour she was far better protected than the Invincibles.

40|$|Abstract: Pre-sedimentary palaeo-topography {{was a major}} {{control on}} facies {{distribution}} during the deposition of the basal unit (the Radnice Member) in the Kladno Basin. The undisturbed accumulation fpeat ook place in calm valleys protected by surrounding ridges from the effect of fluvial dynamics, whereas in open depressions only thin or split coals occurred. Facies di tribution and the thickness of deposits depend on the palaeo-relief which influenced compaction rates and peat bog development without a major role of local syn-sedimentary tectonism within the study area. Different positions of both the <b>maximum</b> <b>thicknesses</b> of the clastic interseam intervals and lines of splitting of the coals have been documented. The thickest coals (up to 7 m) originated near {{the base of the}} Carboniferous deposits in the axes of depressions, either locked or protected by the adjacent ridges. They are underlain mostly by fine-grained sediments, re ponsible for an even compaction rate compensated by peat accumulation. Stratigraphically higher coals have <b>maximum</b> <b>thicknesses</b> of only 2. 5 m at the depression margins or in shallow depressions. Towards the axes of the main depressions they are either split or thinner due to the rapid compaction rate of a thick sequence of fine-grained sediments and organic matter. Moreover, th...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{focus of}} this paper is on {{applications}} (e. g. some leachate collection layers in landfills) where a drainage system consists of a geocomposite overlain by a sand layer. If the geocomposite does not have sufficient flow capacity to convey all the collected liquid, a fraction of the liquid flows in the sand layer. In such drainage systems, the <b>maximum</b> liquid <b>thickness</b> should be calculated to check that the flow capacity of the sand is not exceeded, and the maximum head should be calculated to check that it is less than the maximum head prescribed by regulations. This paper presents a method for calculating the <b>maximum</b> liquid <b>thickness</b> and the <b>maximum</b> head in drainage systems composed of two layers, with the lower layer being a geocomposite.

40|$|Abstract: The {{behaviours}} {{of point}} contact elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) films under impact loads are investigated by direct observations using the optical interferometry technique. It {{has been found}} that when the initial impact gap is large, a central dimple is formed and the <b>maximum</b> film <b>thickness</b> occurs at the centre of the contact region. When the initial impact gap becomes small, a periphery dimple is generated and the <b>maximum</b> film <b>thickness</b> occurs at the contact periphery. When impact is applied to an oily Hertzian contact, the <b>maximum</b> film <b>thickness</b> of the periphery dimple is determined by the increasing rate of the Hertzian contact radius. The impact load under rolling/sliding conditions results in a crescent-shaped oil entrap-ment originally at the inlet of the EHL conjunction, which passes through the EHL conjunction approximately at the entrainment velocity. Some numerical results are also presented to show that the experimental observation in the periphery region is induced by the local squeeze effect...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Detailed {{measurements}} of sea-ice thickness and snow on sea ice were recorded at different locations in fjords {{along the western}} coast of Spitsbergen, the largest island in the Svalbard archipelago, in 2004. Data corresponding to the ice situation before and after melt onset were collected for Kongsfjorden and Van Mijenfjorden, while Hornsund was investigated once during early spring. Profiles of total thickness (snow plus ice thickness) were measured, together with some snow-thickness measure-ments. Total thicknesses were measured with a portable electromagnetic instrument and at selected sites by drilling. The three fjords show some differences in measured thicknesses, connected to individual conditions. However, total thickness does not differ substantially between the three fjords before melt onset. The modal total thickness for all three fjords before melt onset was 1. 075 m, and the corresponding modal snow thickness was 0. 225 m (bin width 0. 05 m). Long-term Kongsfjorden ice-thickness data since 1997 show that the <b>maximum</b> ice <b>thickness</b> varies significantly interannually, as observed at other Arctic sites.
