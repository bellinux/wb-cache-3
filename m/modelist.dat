5|$|Plans for {{restoring}} the courthouse had been proposed {{even before it}} fell into disuse. In 1961, the architectural <b>modelist</b> Theodore Conrad proposed converting the building into a new city hall for Jersey City. The plan would have created a mall {{in front of the}} building and surrounded it with additional city buildings and a museum. Another proposal would house a branch of the New Jersey State Museum in the building. Conrad led a citizens group that lobbied for the preservation of the building, and got it listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The award-winning restoration project resulted in the courthouse being reopened in 1985 for the use of the civil courts and other county offices.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to compare}} the ease of men’s single-pleated pants patterns, and to analyze the fit and {{appearance}} through the 3 D virtual garment system. The researchers selected five(four educational materials and one industrial pattern) slim-fit single-pleated pants which is the current fashion trend in menswear. The CLO 3 D <b>Modelist</b> program was utilized {{to carry out the}} appearance evaluation through virtual wearing, opacity, and clothing pressure. The results showed that D pants had the greatest ease on the waist circumference, while C pants had the least ease. The E pants had the greatest ease on the hip circumference, then B pants and C pants showed less ease. Also, the E pants had the longest on the pants length, then D pants showed the shortest. In the appearance evaluation, A pants received the most favorable results, followed by D, B, E, and C pants, in descending order. The clothing pressure appeared to be mainly red on the waist, crotch, and hem in all pants, so the clothing pressure was high. From the results, we can understand that each of the 5 single-pleated pants patterns has different ease amount and silhouette...|$|E
40|$|The {{first draft}} of the paper {{published}} below was written for a conference in Germany on premodern commentary traditions held over seventeen years ago, in 1997. My coauthors were John B. Henderson, the well-known specialist on Chinese cosmologies, and Peter Robinson, a talented computer <b>modelist</b> at NASA-Ames Research Center who translated my flow chart into the algorithm found {{near the end of}} the paper. The paper has always been a favorite of mine, since it was the first ever to attempt to identify and model key mathematical patterns in the evolution of thought. While the model's initial impact on historians was virtually nil — years later its cross-cultural sides did influence Chinese studies 1 — the model was well received by mathematicians studying complex systems, which encouraged me to continue the directions established in the paper in later years. Our initial paper limited itself to analyzing fractal-like growths in premodern systems, but we anticipated early on that its findings might be generalized to modeling broader segments of culture — a direction in which I have increasingly turned my attention in recent years (see infra). I lightly updated the draft in 2002, mainly to include references to studies my collaborator...|$|E
40|$|The {{workshop}} on Modelling and Numerics of Kinetic Dissipative Systems. {{took place at}} Hotel Giardino sul Mare in the bay of Lipari, the largest island of the Aeolian arcipelago, Messina, Italy, on May 31 th-June 4 th 2004. Major aim of the workshop was to stimulate the interaction between young researchers, graduate students and experts coming from diferent felds, as physics, engineering, mathematics and computer simulations, in identifying key ideas, new advances and open questions in the mathematical analysis {{and the development of}} numerical methods for dissipative systems, including both kinetic and hydrodynamic descriptions. The papers in this volume originate from the lectures given at the workshop. Many of the authors are renowned experts in the feld, and the articles of this book cover a signi. cant part of the recent progresses on kinetic dissipative systems. The book is divided into three parts, which contain respectively recent results in the kinetic theory of granular gases, kinetic theory of chemically reacting gases, and numerical methods for kinetic systems. Part I is devoted to theoretical aspects of granular gases. Granular gases are dilute systems of inelastically colliding particles. As common for open systems, granular gases reveal a rich variety of self-organized structures such as large scale clusters, vertex. elds, characteristic shock waves and others, which are still far from being completely understood. Applications of such systems range from astrophysics (stellar clouds, planetary rings), to industrial processes (handling of pharmaceuticals) and environment (pollution, erosion processes). Many of the results found in the context of granular gases are independent of the particular interaction of the grains and may be applied to other systems of dissipative particles. To understand the origin of common properties of such systems, which may be very different by their physical nature, remains a challenge for scientists working in these felds. Granular gases can be modelled at different scales, with an increasing level of detail: in hydrodynamical models the gas is described in terms of the density of mass, momentum, and energy; in the kinetic description the gas is described by the evolution of a density function in phase space. Some of the many theoretical problems that such mathematical models pose are covered in this first part. Part II presents recent results on modelling of kinetic systems in which molecules can undergo binary collisions in presence of chemical reactions and/or in presence of quantum effects. The study of these models is of paramount importance for a deep understanding of environmental problems (atmospheric pollution among others), where the e. ects of chemical processes can not be neglected. A correct modelling of kinetic systems is here a frst step in the direction of recovering hydrodynamic descriptions. Other applications of kinetic modelling are also presented in this part ranging from semiconductors to economy. Part III contains several contributions related to the construction of suitable numerical methods and simulations for granular gases. This aspect is particularly important in assessing the behavior of the system. Numerical simulations constitute an essential tool not only for obtaining quantitative prediction, but also as a fundamental bridge between theory and experiment, allowing the theoretician to formulate or corroborate conjectures on the properties of a given model, and the <b>modelist</b> to improve the model itself by the feedback of the comparison between numerics and experiment. The most popular and widely used techniques at the kinetic level are of Monte Carlo type. Other approaches which avoid the presence of. uctuations are based on deterministic discretizations of the collision integral at different level. A particular relevance in this feld is represented by discrete velocity models and spectral methods. As an alternative one can resort to fnite diference or fnite volume methods to solve hydrodynamic models which avoid the costly collision integral. Many of these aspects are illustrated in this last part of the book. We are grateful to all authors for their contributions and to the referees whose comments led in many cases to a marked improvement of the manuscripts. For their essential support, our special thanks go to both National Groups of Mathematical Physics (GNFM) and Scientifc Computing (GNCS) of INdAM (National Institute of High Mathematics of Italy), and to the Research Training Network HYKE fHyperbolic and Kinetic Equations: Asymptotics, Numerics, Applicationsf funded by the European Community as contract HPRN-CT- 2002 - 00282.
