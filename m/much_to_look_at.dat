500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} Madonna {{delivered}} a [...] "joyous, unironic, openhearted" [...] show {{rather than a}} cautious performance. According to Tucker, the singer was in [...] "full command"; although the visuals lacked flow, the song transitions meshed [...] "perfectly". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph called the show a [...] "tribute to Madonna" [...] and a [...] "shameless" [...] promotion of the singer's return to the music scene after directing W.E.: [...] "The message [...] {{is that she is}} back in business. I suspect she’d settle for a global number one over global harmony". Troy Patterson of Slate wrote that Madonna retained her [...] "greatest marketing agent" [...] title with the show and praised its costumes, sets and the singer's repeated self-referencing. Linda Holmes of NPR said, [...] "What's curious, given how much 'ewww, she's too old' stuff went around on Twitter, is that everything she did Sunday night is exactly what it should mean to age gracefully". Miriam Coleman of Rolling Stone called the show a [...] "serious spectacle", and Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News called it a [...] "high-concept music video": [...] "Madonna brilliantly manipulates the combined impact of visuals and sonics. The 13-minute performance was an eye-popping marvel". A Huffington Post reviewer wrote, [...] "Love her or hate her, there's no doubt that only Madonna can bring a certain level of pop flair to a performance". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic praised the show's choreography and cinematography: [...] "With so, so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> Madonna remained the center of attention. That is, until the end, when white light and smoke engulfed her and she dropped down through the stage, out of sight". According to Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, Madonna controlled her nerves and he liked her selection of songs.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{graduation}} Lake {{was ordained}} a deacon in the Church of England (1895) {{and served as}} curate in Lumley, Durham, where he preached to the pitmen and miners in that North Country mining district. [...] "I {{do not believe that}} theology entered very much into his sermons," [...] recalls his son, [...] "but he did conduct The Mikado and he still {{tells the story of the}} brawny pitman who, having rescued him from the attack of a drunken navvy from a neighbouring village and listened to his comments on the situation, said 'Mon, he's no <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> but has he no a bonny tongue?!'" [...] After a year's service he was ordained priest (1896), however he had further issues with his heart and decided to return to Oxford, to the less rigorous climate of the South in order to improve his health.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's just it. He's not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> but {{you forget}} his homeliness right off," [...] replied Columbine, warmly. [...] "You feel {{something}} behind all his--his looks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{same as you}} or me," [...] was the uncompromising answer: [...] "not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at.</b> I didn't know he was a gen'lem'n; but then, I {{never see}} him cleaned up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's them, sir," [...] the {{sergeant}} {{in charge of}} the party replied. [...] "Not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> are they? But, by gosh, you should see them fight! You wouldn't think of their looks then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear, here's your letter. I am {{so sorry}} to have been too <b>much</b> {{hindered}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it before. You must not mind, Dolly. I know it is very disagreeable; but every one who has the care of precious articles like young ladies is bound <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have nothing}} to tell you, for I know nothing," [...] Cyril replied. [...] "Our work was simply pulling down and blowing up houses. I had scarce time so <b>much</b> as <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the fire. However, as I have since been working all round its course, I can tell you exactly how far it spread." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} they say; and that then he asked her more and more, and went {{down on his knees}} to her, and prayed her just as <b>much</b> as <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him; and kissed her feet, and cried dreadfully; and that all she did was to turn aside her face, and bid him rise and leave her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boarding-houses are so {{much the}} rule here, {{that it is not}} easy to get rooms. You will find Mrs. Myers a good soul, and though the house is not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> it is {{comfortable}} enough inside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There he is, my girl," [...] {{said her}} father, patting {{her on the}} back. [...] "He's not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> and he treated you very shabby, {{but if you want}} him I suppose you must have him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That 'oss," [...] he said, [...] "ain't {{what she}} was, it's true, but there's {{a lot of}} work in 'er yet. She may not be <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> but she's worth forty quid to me--ay, and one to spit on!" ...|$|E

50|$|From the XUL code {{it is easy}} to {{see what}} the layout of the table will be. The {{assumption}} is that for web-designers it is <b>much</b> easier <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a declarative page that uses familiar, HTML like tags. The application developers can concentrate on specifying the behavior for the GUI elements. There is also a good separation between layout, styling and processing.|$|R
60|$|An {{interval}} elapsed--long or short, I cannot say which; I was too <b>much</b> excited <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> my watch. All I {{know is that}} I discovered her! She {{crossed the}} yard, after waiting {{to make sure that}} no one was there to see her; and she entered the stable by the door which led to that part of the building occupied by Michael. This time I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> my watch.|$|R
60|$|It was midwinter. The {{owner of}} Willow Creek stood at his parlour window, smoking and gazing. There was not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> for snow had {{overwhelmed}} and buried the landscape, fringed every twig of the willows, and obliterated the frozen river.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] he said reflectively, [...] "what we men see in you. You {{have plenty}} of admirers. They say that Grefton got himself shot out at the front because you treated him badly. Yet--you are not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The next {{question}} required some consideration, and {{he appeared to}} ruminate over it. [...] "You mean {{what kind of man}} he is?" [...] he said. [...] "Well, he's not very <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> and there are a good many things he don't know." ...|$|E

60|$|Mrs Null now {{looked about}} her with much interest, and asked many {{questions}} {{in regard to}} the old woman's comfort and ailments. To these the answers, though on the whole satisfactory, were quite short, Aunt Patsy, apparently, <b>much</b> preferring <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her visitor than to talk to her.

60|$|Harris {{made his}} way up the hill, to the path, toward the {{hospital}} building. The whole thing was beginning to become more clear to him. A boy who had struggled all his life. Financial insecurity. Idealized goal, getting a Patrol assignment. Finally reached it, found the load too great. And on Asteroid Y-3 there was too <b>much</b> vegetation <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> all day. Primitive identification and projection on the flora of the asteroid. Concept of security involved in immobility and permanence. Unchanging forest.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here,' she said; 'take this whistle {{in return}} for your lunch. It isn't <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> but if you blow it, {{anything}} that you have lost or that has been taken from you will find its way {{back to you in}} a moment.' ...|$|E
60|$|His father {{caught a}} brown bald-faced horse, nothing <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> that acted gentle enough {{until he was}} mounted. Then!--He arched his back, jumped up stiff legged, and began to pitch. Evidently Smith had been a {{horseman}} in his day. He stayed on.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you'd {{had as much}} of this as I have you'd talk of {{something}} else," [...] he growled, after a half dozen attempts at conversation. Bill wasn't <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> {{but he was a}} good driver and the stranger respected him for it.|$|E

"Ah, it is a sinful {{thing to}} come hither without a sorrow," [...] murmured the aged lady, in accents that partook {{of the eternal}} tremor which pervaded her whole being [...] "Depart, young man!

6000|$|... "Miss Stacy never {{mentioned}} {{such a thing}} to me, Anne, and its only your guilty conscience that's the matter with you. You have no business to be taking storybooks to school.

6000|$|... "I {{should have}} guessed as <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her," [...] Ernest answered, {{with a faint}} {{undertone}} of sarcasm in his voice that was quite thrown away upon Harry Balfour.

6000|$|... 'Well,' said Mr Boffin, 'I {{should say}} I was a disappintment {{to you when}} I WAS pinted out, if your politeness would allow you to confess it, for I am well aware I am not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at.</b> What might you want with me? Not in the law, are you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That is the Tiger,” Mr. Hewson said as {{he stopped}} at the side of a fine craft. “She is six hundred tons, three years old, and a fast sailer. She is not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> at present, but when she is in full dress she is a {{handsome}} vessel.” ...|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{it could}} be argued that it does not make <b>much</b> sense <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> all Latin American {{countries}} given that some of them have very low rates of emigration and hardly receive remittances (for instance, Brazil or Argentina). In Appendix C, Table 10, we show that the results are robust to running the models on 10 high emigration and remittance receiving countries (El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Guatemala, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Mexico, and Colombia). The results are indeed stronger, especially for opinions regarding the role of the state, rather than the individual, in the creation of jobs.|$|R
5000|$|From Youngstown, McGinness {{moved to}} the Physics Department of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The {{department}} {{had an interest in}} the physical properties of melanin as a possible hook to treating melanoma. While of enormous importance now, this area was a research backwater at the time. With the notable exception of Bolto et al., who had reported [...] high conductivity in iodine-doped polypyrrole, [...] few but melanoma researchers had <b>much</b> reason <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the electronic properties of such rigid-backbone polymer [...] "blacks". This is why the putative first molecular electronic device came from a cancer hospital.|$|R
60|$|However, our men {{not being}} able to go any farther against the tide, took no notice of that; but, after a little while some of them, in one of the smaller boats, rowed towards the shore, holding up a white flag to the people in token of friendship; but it was all one, and would have been all one for aught we knew, if they had held up a red flag, for they all ran away, men, women, and children; nor could our men by any persuasions, by {{gestures}} and signs of any kind, prevail on them to stay, or hardly so <b>much</b> as <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them.|$|R
