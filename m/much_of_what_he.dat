5|$|After {{considering}} {{pursuing a}} master's degree {{on the topic}} of hard science fiction novels as fascist literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records. During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater. Impatient at <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw at a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author John Shirley. The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.|$|E
5|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{did in the}} Senate can be {{described}} as the typical sponsorship of legislation that would benefit his state. With his sponsorship, the Senate passed a bill that would aid railroads in Florida, and another that would sell off some of the live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy; both bills failed in the House of Representatives. He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids, and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida. None of this would have been considered exceptional for the era.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Battuta {{travelled}} from Beijing to Hangzhou, {{and then}} proceeded to Fuzhou. Upon his return to Quanzhou, he soon boarded a Chinese junk owned by the Sultan of Samudera Pasai Sultanate heading for Southeast Asia, whereupon Ibn Battuta was unfairly charged a hefty sum by the crew and lost <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had collected during his stay in China.|$|E

50|$|Howard Thorne is {{a rapist}} in Los Angeles: he meets women {{at work and}} at parties or he sees them walking down the street, and he follows them, terrifies them, and assaults them. He also dreams about these assaults, and <b>he's</b> unclear how <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> done is real {{and how much is}} fantasy. He ignores his heroin-using wife, Vicki, who tries {{everything}} she can think of to get his sexual attention. Howard and Vicki go separately to a costume party where she learns the full truth about his nature and where he is stalked by one of his recent victims. Individualized versions of Hell await Howard and Vicki.|$|R
25|$|Plunkett's {{task was}} frustrating. He {{was a pioneer}} {{of the concept of}} {{systematic}} rural development, who, in spite of his role in Irish affairs being often overlooked, influenced many international reformers, and can be credited {{as one of the few}} who had a long-term vision for the development of rural Ireland. He was apt to remind audiences that, even if full peasant proprietorship was achieved and Home Rule was implemented, rural underdevelopment would still have to be faced. But class conflict between farmers and shopkeepers intervened to frustrate <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> aimed to do.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} before, one of {{the most}} notable synesthetes is Solomon Shereshevsky, a newspaper reporter turned celebrated mnemonist, who was discovered by Russian neuropsychologist, Alexander Luria, to have a rare fivefold form of synesthesia. Words and text were not only associated with highly vivid visuo-spatial imagery but also sound, taste, color, and sensation. Shereshevsky could recount endless details of many things without form, from lists of names to decades-old conversations, but he had great difficulty grasping abstract concepts. The automatic, and nearly permanent, retention of every little detail due to synesthesia greatly inhibited Shereshevsky from understanding <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> read or heard.|$|E
25|$|At {{the trial}} for Zach, it was {{alleged that the}} state used {{unethical}} investigatory techniques to coerce a confession from Dylan. In 2014, Dylan was arrested on federal gun charges that would have ended in a lengthy prison sentence. The prosecutor, who was also handing the Bobo case, arranged a no-jail plea deal {{on the condition that}} he go live with a retired police officer, Dennis Benjamin, who Dylan did not know. Five weeks later, Benjamin called 911 to report that he had someone in his home that wanted to confess to the murder of Holly Bobo. Despite the fact that this confession led to the arrests, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> confessed to did not match the evidence.|$|E

25|$|Arnold was {{an outspoken}} critic of the trend towards high levels of {{abstraction}} in mathematics {{during the middle of the}} last century. He had very strong opinions on how this approach—which was most popularly implemented by the Bourbaki school in France—initially had a negative impact on French mathematical education, and then later on that of other countries as well. Arnold was very interested in the history of mathematics. In an interview, he said he had learned <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> knew about mathematics through the study of Felix Klein's book Development of Mathematics in the 19th Century —a book he often recommended to his students. He liked to study the classics, most notably the works of Huygens, Newton and Poincaré, and many times he reported to have found in their works ideas that had not been explored yet.|$|E
25|$|Before leaving China, Mosby {{had written}} Grant seeking help in finding another position. Grant responded (as he was dying) {{with a letter}} recommending Mosby to Senator Leland Stanford, a former California {{railroad}} magnate. Mosby then spent about 16 years in California, working as {{a lawyer for the}} Southern Pacific Railroad until the death of his mentor Collis Huntington. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did remains unknown, due to a fire which destroyed the company's records of that era. Although Mosby hated the desk work, he twice returned to Washington, D.C. to argue before the United States Supreme Court—once based on the consul fees he had remitted to the Treasury (and which the claims court found him entitled to) and once for the railroad. Mosby also wrote articles for Eastern newspapers about his escapades during the Civil war, and traveled to New England on a speaking tour where he met Oliver Wendell Holmes(both father and son). He also befriended the Patton family and spent time at their ranch with their young son, George S. Patton, recreating Civil War battles, with Mosby playing himself and George playing Robert E. Lee. Also, he tried to volunteer for the Spanish–American War, but Mosby's Hussars who trained in Oakland, California never disembarked for Cuba nor the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|Gardner's {{mother had}} died in 1920, {{but he had not}} {{returned}} to Britain on that occasion. However, in 1927 his father became very ill with dementia, and Gardner decided to visit him. On his return to Britain, Gardner began to investigate spiritualism and mediumship. He soon had several encounters which he attributed to spirits of deceased family members. Continuing to visit Spiritualist churches and séances, he was highly critical of <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw, although he encountered several mediums he considered genuine. One medium apparently made contact with a deceased cousin of Gardner's, an event which impressed him greatly. His first biographer Jack Bracelin reports that this was a watershed in Gardner's life, and that a previous academic interest in spiritualism and life after death thereafter became a matter of firm personal belief for him. The very same evening (28 July 1927) after Gardner had met this medium, he met the woman he was to marry; Dorothea Frances Rosedale, known as Donna, a relation of his sister-in-law Edith. He asked her to marry him the next day and she agreed. Because his leave {{was coming to an end}} very soon, they married quickly on 16 August at St Jude's Church, Kensington, and then honeymooned in Ryde on the Isle of Wight, before heading via France to Malaya.|$|E

You all remember, however, how large he is. Now when I was a boy, it used to be considered dishonorable and cowardly for a large, strong boy to abuse a little one who cannot defend himself. Is it considered so now?" ...|$|R
50|$|He {{recorded}} principally for the Columbia label, but, unfortunately, most {{of these}} do not do his voice justice. Private recordings made in the 1950s are a <b>much</b> better indication <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> really sounded like, the voice being warm and round. He was a true bass, being able to sing bottom B with ease.|$|R

500|$|Robert Thickett {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} August 2013 for the Mortgage Strategy website. He opined that Occupy felt [...] "nostalgic", largely because the Occupy movement itself [...] "has largely run out of steam."

500|$|In 1933, Childe {{travelled}} to Asia, visiting Iraq [...] a {{place he}} thought [...] "great fun" [...] and India, which he felt was [...] "detestable" [...] due to the hot weather and extreme poverty. Touring archaeological sites in the two countries, he opined that <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had written in The Most Ancient Near East was outdated, going on to produce New Light on the Most Ancient Near East (1935), applying his Marxist-influenced ideas about the economy to his conclusions.|$|E

60|$|Intimate {{as the two}} men were, {{there had}} {{hitherto}} been very little borrowing or lending between them; and now Alaric felt as though he owed it to his intimacy with his friend to explain to him why he wanted so large a sum in so short a time. He felt, moreover, that he would not himself be so <b>much</b> ashamed <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done if he could confess it to some one else. He could then solace himself with the reflection that he had done nothing secret. Norman, he supposed, would be displeased; but then Norman's displeasure could not injure him, and with Norman there would be no danger that the affair would go any further.|$|R

Eventually, a large two-volume work emerges and is taken up by his wife’s publishers more as a favour than anything else. The work is an unexpected success and the gaze of the literary set turns from Mrs Clinton to her Husband.|$|R

500|$|Heber {{wished to}} pass on to the Governor General, Lord Amherst, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had learned and {{observed}} on his long voyage, and on his return to Calcutta busied himself with a series of detailed reports. He also wrote to Williams-Wynn in London, strongly criticising the East India Company's stewardship of its Indian territories. He was concerned that few Indians were promoted to senior posts, and noted the [...] "bullying, insolent manner" [...] towards Indians that was typically adopted by the British. Many local matters also demanded Heber's attention: the next phase in the development of Bishop's College, the preparation of a Hindustani dictionary, and a series of ordinations including that of Abdul Masih, an elderly Lutheran whose reception into Anglican orders had earlier been resisted by Bishop Middleton, on unspecified grounds ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{retired from}} the military, Middleton was soon called to serve {{in a variety of}} {{advisory}} capacities. In April 1946 he was appointed to the Doolittle Board, set up to investigate officer-enlisted men relationships, and headed by former Air Corps General James H. Doolittle. [...] The board made a number of recommendations, one of the more significant ones being to allow the non-commissioned officers to establish their own clubs, a recommendation supported by Bill Mauldin. [...] Three years later Middleton was asked to serve on the Military Education Panel of the Service Academy Board to look at the curricula of the Military and Naval Academies, and the proposed Air Force Academy as well. [...] Working for nine months on recommendations, Middleton stressed a more liberal education for the academies, and <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> recommended was accepted.|$|E

By late 1843, the New Zealand Company {{was in need of}} good pastoral land around Nelson. It had clashed with Māori in the Wairau Affray in the Wairau Valley, to the south-east of Nelson and several company employees, including Arthur Wakefield, were killed.

500|$|Manne {{is often}} {{associated}} with the once frequently criticized West Coast school of jazz. He has been considered [...] "the quintessential" [...] drummer in what was seen as a West Coast movement, though Manne himself did not care to be so pigeonholed. In the 1950s, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did could be seen as in the West Coast style: performing in tightly arranged compositions in what was a cool style, as in his 1953 album named The West Coast Sound, for which he commissioned several original compositions. Some of West Coast jazz was experimental, avant-garde music several years before the more mainstream avant-garde playing of Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman (Manne also recorded with Coleman in 1959); a good deal of Manne's work with Jimmy Giuffre was of this kind. Critics would condemn much of this music as overly cerebral.|$|E
500|$|Silberkleit's {{magazines}} {{were given}} very limited budgets. [...] Hornig worked with Julius Schwartz, a literary agent {{who was a}} friend of his; this gave him access to stories by the writers Schwartz represented, but Schwartz would not allow his authors' real names to be used unless they were paid at least one cent per word. [...] Hornig could not afford to pay the one cent rate for everything he bought, so he paid half a cent a word for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> acquired through Schwartz, and ran those stories under pseudonyms. [...] Unsurprisingly, given the low rates, the stories sent to Hornig had usually already been rejected by the better-paying markets. [...] The result was mediocre fiction, even from the better known writers that Hornig was able to attract. [...] The magazines paid on publication, rather than acceptance, and this slower payment also discouraged some authors from submitting material.|$|E
500|$|Many of Iowa's leading statesmen, {{including}} Weaver's former adversaries, praised him at {{his funeral}} and in the years thereafter. Fusion with the Democrats had brought Populist policy into the mainstream, {{and several of the}} policies for which Weaver fought became law after his death, including the direct election of Senators, a graduated income tax, and a monetary policy not based on the gold standard; others, such as public ownership of the railroads and telephone companies, were never enacted. In a 2008 biography, RobertB. Mitchell wrote that [...] "Weaver's legacy cannot be assessed using conventional measures" [...] as <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> fought for did not come to pass until after his death.
