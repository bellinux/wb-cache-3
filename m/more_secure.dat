5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} <b>more</b> <b>secure</b> and provide the divers' surface cover with a visual reference for the divers' position. It consists of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys. The bars are of sufficient weight and the buoys of sufficient buoyancy that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if the divers experience buoyancy control problems.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, most war {{memorials}} {{were relatively}} conservative in design, aiming to use established styles {{to produce a}} tragic but comforting, noble and enduring commemoration of the war dead. Classical themes were particularly common, taking the prevailing styles of the late 19th century and typically simplifying them to produce cleaner, more abstract memorials. Allegorical and symbolic features, frequently drawing on Christian imagery, were used to communicate themes of self-sacrifice, victory and death. Some memorials adopted a medievalist theme instead, looking backwards to a <b>more</b> <b>secure</b> past, while others used emerging realist and Art Deco architectural styles to communicate the themes of the war.|$|E

5|$|By summer 1537, Montejo {{believed}} that Higueras {{had been almost}} completely pacified, with very few casualties amongst either the Spanish or the natives. Gracias a Dios and San Pedro were <b>more</b> <b>secure,</b> and many Indians had returned to their villages, encouraged by Montejo's moderate policies. In reality, only the areas around the Spanish settlements had been thoroughly conquered, and in the remoter areas {{the vast majority of}} the natives were still hostile to the Spanish, and determined to resist. In contrast to other provinces, the Spanish were unable to recruit reliable native auxiliaries to assist their conquest.|$|E
5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a <b>more</b> <b>secure</b> fixation of the tube. As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} hundred years the Grimaldi defended their {{territory}} from attacks by other states which included Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Naples, France, Spain, Germany, England and Provence.

5|$|In the Byzantine {{period the}} {{evolution}} of the port is halted due to the frequent invasions by the migratory people, the trade was fading and the traders were looking for other <b>more</b> <b>secure</b> markets like Venice or Genoa but many constructions in the port maintain the name genovese in the memory of the merchants from the Italian city. After a brief period when the port was under Romanian rule, the Dobruja region was occupied by the Ottoman Empire. In 1857, the Turkish authorities leased the port and the Cernavodă–Constanța Railway to the British company Danube and Black Sea Railway and Kustendge Harbour Company Ltd.|$|E
5|$|Now a centre {{for arms}} manufacture, the castle was made <b>more</b> <b>secure,</b> {{with a new}} {{defensive}} ditch, freshly repaired walls and a new chapel. The castle was garrisoned with royal troops during the uprising of Richard Marshal against Henry III in 1233–4, suggesting it had considerable military value at this time. Another indicator of the military importance of the castle and the surrounding forest was the £20 fee each year being paid to the constable of the castle by 1287, {{on a par with}} the much larger castles of Rhuddlan or Nottingham.|$|E

The Düsseldorf-born player feels <b>more</b> <b>secured</b> in the field on the position of the central defensive midfielder, but in Germany he played sometimes even as a right-back or even a centre-back. The most striking feature in Petsos' game is its excellent shooting technique.|$|R
5|$|Other {{problems}} also emerged. In 1689, Anne's supporters (including the Marlboroughs and the Duke of Somerset) {{demanded that}} she be granted a parliamentary annuity of £50,000, a sum that would end her dependence on William and Mary. Sarah {{was seen as the}} driving force behind this bill, creating further ill-feeling towards her at court. William responded to the demand by offering the same sum from the Privy Purse, to keep Anne dependent on his generosity. However, Anne, through Sarah, refused, pointing out that a parliamentary grant would be <b>more</b> <b>secure</b> than charity from the Privy Purse. Eventually Anne received the grant from Parliament, and felt she owed this to Sarah's efforts.|$|E
5|$|The chief threats {{faced by}} the brolga, {{particularly}} {{in the southern part}} of its range, are habitat destruction, the drainage of wetlands, collision with powerlines, and predation by the introduced red fox. It is <b>more</b> <b>secure</b> in its northern habitat as the land is mostly unsuitable for farming and much of it is in national parks or private ownership, but changes in vegetation cover, encouraged by the rooting activities of feral pigs, may reduce the abundance of bulkuru sedge and may make the brolga more vulnerable by providing cover for predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{enclosed}} {{design of}} the Albert Dock and the direct loading and unloading of goods from warehouses meant that the complex was <b>more</b> <b>secure</b> than other docks within Liverpool. As a result it became a popular store for valuable cargoes including brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar. At the same time their openness to natural light and well ventilated stores meant natural goods such as hemp or sugar could be kept fresher, for longer. The dock came to dominate Liverpool's far eastern trade, with over 90% of the city's silk imports from China coming through it and more generally {{half of all the}} far eastern trade income.|$|E

40|$|The {{trend in}} {{information}} technology is towards achieving ubiquitous service rendering where barriers (geographical, time) in getting information related services will be eliminated. A {{good example of this}} is the ATM machines used by banks for public banking services, the likes in other sectors are currently on the way. This paper explores the user’s perception on the current identity authentication (Token-based and Knowledgebased) with a view to predict a <b>more</b> <b>secured</b> authentication for authentication in public places. A survey study is conducted so as to justify the claims of the previous authors on the need to migrate from the conventional knowledge-based and tokenbased authentication methods to a <b>more</b> <b>secured</b> biometric authentication approach which makes impossible user’s impersonation, and thus minimizing fraud, particularly in business transactions. Also, biometrical identification was also reviewed with respect to the all known biometric identifiers where human iris data was revealed to be the best human trait {{that can be used for}} identification/authentication purposes in public zone...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a unique}} data set {{collected}} from financial statements of all Singapore listed firms from 1983 to 1991, we provide international {{evidence on the}} determinants {{of the amount of}} secured loans as a fraction of total secured and unsecured loans. This data set comprises a much wider range of firms than most previous studies. We show that consistent with the agency-cost hypothesis, firms with more growth opportunities use <b>more</b> <b>secured</b> loans. This is in contrast to the opposite result reported in Barclay and Smith (1995 b) who measure secured debt as a fraction of total long-term fixed claims. We also find strong support for the hypothesis that smaller firms use <b>more</b> <b>secured</b> loans. In contrast, Leeth and Scott (1989), using survey data on small firms, find an insignificant firm size effect. Finally, we show that the use of secured loans is positively related to asset riskiness and loan size, and is negatively related to asset specificity. Firm quality has no explanatory power.
