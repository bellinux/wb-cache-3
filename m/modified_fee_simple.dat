5000|$|If {{previous}} grantors of a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> estate do {{not create}} any conditions for subsequent grantees, then {{the title is}} called <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> absolute. A <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> absolute is the highest estate permitted by law and it gives the holder full possessory rights and obligations {{now and in the}} future. Other <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> estates in real property include <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> defeasible (or <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable) estates. A defeasible estate is created when a grantor places a condition on a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> estate (in the deed). When a specified event happens, the estate may become void or subject to annulment. There are two types of defeasible estates: <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable and the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to a condition subsequent. If the grantor uses durational language in the condition such as [...] "to A. as long as the land is used for a park", then upon the happening of the specified event (in this case if the land is used for anything other than a park), the estate will automatically terminate and revert to the grantor or the grantor's estate; this is called a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable. If the grantor uses language such as [...] "but if alcohol is served", then the grantor or the heirs have a right of entry if the condition occurs, but the estate does not automatically revert to the grantor; this is a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to a condition subsequent. In most jurisdictions in the United States these concepts have been <b>modified</b> by statute. <b>Fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable was generally preferred by courts in the common law of the early United States. Recently, that trend has reversed, and most courts in the United States will find a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to condition subsequent in situations where the conveying document's language is unclear.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fee</b> <b>simple</b> estates may {{be either}} <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> {{absolute}} or defeasible (i.e. subject to future conditions) like <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable and <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to condition subsequent; {{this is the}} complex system of future interests (q.v.) which allows concepts of trusts and estates to elide into actuarial science {{through the use of}} life contingencies.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable is {{an estate}} that will end {{automatically}} when the stated event or condition occurs. The interest will {{revert to the}} grantor or the heirs of the grantor. Normally, a possibility of reverter follows a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable. However a possibility of reverter does not follow a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable subject to an executory interest. Durational language such as [...] "to A {{as long as the}} property is used for a park" [...] creates a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable and a possibility of reverter.|$|R
40|$|Prominent {{economically}} oriented legal academics {{are currently}} {{arguing that the}} <b>fee</b> <b>simple,</b> the dominant form of private landownership in the United States, is an inefficient way for society to allocate land. They maintain that the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> blocks transfers of land to higher value uses because it provides property owners with a perpetual monopoly. The critics propose that landownership be reformulated to enable private actors to forcibly purchase land from other private owners, {{similar to the way}} that governments can expropriate land for public uses using eminent domain. While recognizing the significance of the critique, this Article takes issue with it and defends the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> The Article makes two main points in defense of the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> First, addressing the critique on its own economic terms, the Article argues that the critics have not established that there is a robust economic argument for dispensing with the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> The critique that the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> leads to the misallocation of land rests on three empirical premises for which the critics have yet to provide much evidence. The critique also downplays or overlooks important economic benefits of the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> Second, departing from the economic discourse of the critics, the Article argues that the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> is valuable because it gives landowners a perpetual right to choose, free from the dictates of others, whether to transfer their land. Thus the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> expands the choices of landowners and promotes their independence and autonomy. Eliminating the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> would leave landowners vulnerable to the whims of others, and less free and autonomous. Landownership is not only about efficiency, but also about individual freedom...|$|R
50|$|Leased fee value - This {{is simply}} the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> {{interest}} encumbered by a lease. If the lease is at market rent, then the leased fee value and the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> value are equal. However, if the tenant pays {{more or less than}} market, the residual owned by the leased fee holder, plus the market value of the tenancy, may be more or less than the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> value.|$|R
25|$|Takings {{may be of}} {{the subject}} {{property}} in its entirety (total take) or in part (part take), either quantitatively or qualitatively (either partially in <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> or, commonly, an easement, or any other interest less than the full <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> title).|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> {{subject to}} a {{condition}} subsequent is created when {{the words of a}} grant support the conclusion that the grantor intends to convey a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> absolute but has attached a condition to the grant so that if a specified future event happens the grantor will get its <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> absolute back, provided that the grantor exercises his right of entry (or power of termination). Thus, a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to condition subsequent does not end automatically upon the happening of the condition. The future interest is called a [...] "right of reentry" [...] or [...] "right of entry," [...] and the property only reverts to the original grantor if he exercises this right.|$|R
50|$|The Rule's effect ended there. After that, the {{doctrine}} of merger operated on the two successive freehold estates placed in the same purchaser (B's life estate and B's remainder in <b>fee</b> <b>simple)</b> and converted them into a single <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> absolute in B.|$|R

But unlike a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to a condition subsequent, Blackacre goes to a third party (B) instead of the grantor (O) if the condition is met. Also unlike a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to a condition subsequent, B then automatically gains the interest in Blackacre and does not only have a mere right to sue for re-entry.|$|R

50|$|In English law, a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> or <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> {{absolute}} is {{an estate}} in land, {{a form of}} freehold ownership. It is a way that real estate may be owned in common law countries, and is the highest possible ownership interest that can be held in real property. Allodial title is reserved to governments under a civil law structure. The rights of the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> owner are limited by government powers of taxation, compulsory purchase, police power, and escheat, and {{it could also be}} limited further by certain encumbrances or conditions in the deed, such as, for example, a condition that required the land {{to be used as a}} public park, with a reversion interest in the grantor if the condition fails; this is a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> conditional.|$|R

Since those rights are incident to a <b>fee</b> <b>simple,</b> when a testator devises such an estate, the devisee obtains those rights, not under the will but as incident to the estate devised.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} a [...] "fee" [...] has its origins in feudalism. William Blackstone defined <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> as the estate in land that a person has when the lands are given {{to him and his}} heirs absolutely, without any end or limit put to his estate. Land held in <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> can be {{conveyed}} to whomsoever its owner pleases; it can also be mortgaged or put up as security.Owners of real property in <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> have the privilege of interest in the property during their lifetime and typically have a say in determining who gets to own an interest in the property after their death.|$|R
50|$|In Ireland, section 13 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 {{abolished}} the fee tail in Ireland and converted existing fees tail to <b>fees</b> <b>simple.</b> For constitutional reasons, this section {{is subject to}} a saving clause which prevents the conversion of fees tail to <b>fees</b> <b>simple</b> where the protector of the settlement is still alive. Therefore, fees tail still exist in Ireland.|$|R
50|$|Remainder: A {{remainder}} {{arises when}} a tenant with a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> grants someone a life estate or conditional <b>fee</b> <b>simple,</b> and specifies {{a third party}} to whom the land goes when the life estate ends or the condition occurs. The third party {{is said to have}} a remainder. The third party may have a legal right to limit the life tenant's use of the land.|$|R
50|$|This {{means that}} the joint tenants must have {{the same type of}} {{interest}}, and the interest must run for the same duration. For example, if X and Y create a joint tenancy, both X and Y's interests must be in <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> absolute. If, for example, X has a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> absolute and Y has a life estate, there is no unity of interest.|$|R
50|$|Some jurisdictions in the United States have {{abolished}} this interest. For example, Kentucky {{abolished the}} <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable and {{possibility of reverter}} by statute in 1960. An attempt to create such an interest is construed as a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to condition subsequent (see below), and a person who would have possibility of reverter at common law will instead have a right of entry.|$|R
