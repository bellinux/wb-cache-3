5|$|Mimesis is practised by {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon, Phycodurus eques, and the leaf scorpionfish, Taenianotus triacanthus, which {{resemble}} parts of plants, and gently rock their bodies as if swayed by a current. In the fish species Novaculichthys taeniourus, the rockmover or dragon wrasse, there is a striking difference in appearance between the adults and the juveniles. A juvenile Rockmover resembles a loose piece of sea weed. It swims in a vertical position with its head pointing downwards, and behaves {{in a way that}} perfectly resembles the movement of a piece of seaweed: <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in the surge, as if it was inanimate.|$|E
25|$|The {{family moved}} house often, <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between Ireland and England several times, {{leading to a}} feeling of {{displacement}} which remained with the artist throughout his life. In 1911 the family lived in Cannycourt House near Kilcullen, County Kildare, but later moved to Westbourne Terrace in London, close to where Bacon's father worked at the Territorial Force Records Office. They returned to Ireland after the First World War. Bacon lived with his maternal grandmother and step-grandfather, Winifred and Kerry Supple, at Farmleigh, Abbeyleix, County Laois, although {{the rest of the}} family again moved to Straffan Lodge near Naas, County Kildare.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, 45% of the 250,000 valve {{replacement}} procedures performed annually involve a mechanical valve implant. The {{most widely used}} valve is a bileaflet disc heart valve, or St. Jude valve. The mechanics involve two semicircular discs <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> with both allowing {{the flow of blood}} as well as the ability to form a seal against backflow. The valve is coated with pyrolytic carbon, and secured to the surrounding tissue with a mesh of woven fabric called Dacron (du Pont's trade name for polyethylene terephthalate). The mesh allows for the body's tissue to grow while incorporating the valve.|$|E

25|$|Born Ardel Mockbee on October 28, 1907, in Spokane, Washington, Ardel Wray was {{the only}} child of Virginia Brissac and Eugene Mockbee, both stage actors working in West Coast stock {{companies}} in the early 1900s. When her parents separated, she was brought to live with her maternal grandparents in San Francisco while her mother continued her career. She spent most of her childhood <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between her grandparents' home and a boarding school, and was raised primarily by her grandfather, B. F.

He became interested in skateboarding and punk rock in junior high, and received a bass guitar from his father at the age of fifteen. After moving to San Diego in 1992, Hoppus' sister introduced him to Tom DeLonge, and together with drummer Scott Raynor, they formed the band Blink-182. Following Raynor and DeLonge's departures from the band in 1998 and 2015, respectively, Hoppus is now the only remaining founding member of Blink-182.|$|E
25|$|Whistles that {{generate}} sound through fluctuations of momentum or a force exerted on the surrounding medium are called dipole-like sources. The {{figure on the}} right is example of a small rigid sphere that is <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in a given direction. If the sphere is small with respect to the wavelength of the sound emitted, it can be called a point dipole. A force must be applied to the sphere in a specific direction to move it. The surrounding medium in the direction of motion is compressed to radiate sound, but the medium at right angles slides past the sphere and is not compressed.|$|E

25|$|Power factor {{correction}} brings the power factor of an AC power circuit closer to 1 by supplying or absorbing reactive power, adding capacitors or inductors that act {{to cancel the}} inductive or capacitive effects of the load, respectively. In the case of offsetting the inductive effect of motor loads, capacitors can be locally connected. These capacitors help to generate reactive power {{to meet the demand}} of the inductive loads. This will keep that reactive power from having to flow {{all the way from the}} utility generator to the load. In the electricity industry, inductors are said to consume reactive power and capacitors are said to supply it, even though reactive power is just energy <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> on each AC cycle.|$|E

He spent the next several months <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between Sarajevo and Belgrade. In Belgrade he met Živojin Rafajlović, {{one of the founders of}} the Serbian Chetnik Organization, who sent him (alongside 15 other Young Bosnia members) to the Chetnik training centre in Vranje. There they met with school manager Mihajlo Stevanović-Cupara. He lived in Cupara's house, which is today located on Gavrilo Princip Street in Vranje. Princip practiced shooting, using bombs and the blade, after which training was completed and he returned to Belgrade.|$|E
500|$|There {{are some}} {{inherent}} criticisms to joint physical custody. A {{criticism of the}} joint physical custody arrangement is that {{due to the nature}} of the arrangement, the parents are in frequent contact with each other than in other situations, leading to conflict which has the potential to negatively impact all parties involved, including the children. Research does not support this concern. Numerous studies found that parents with joint physical custody had lower levels of conflict. There are numerous opinions that the constant <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between two homes will have a negative impact on children emotionally.

500|$|Reviewers of {{the first}} three episodes {{interpreted}} Carnivàles story as being full of myth and allegory. The show was seen as more than just a human-scaled metaphor of good and evil, with the power of spirits as one of the show's strongest elements. Some reviewers were deeply confused and described almost everything as [...] "mysterious" [...] the characters and their powers and abilities, characters and scenarios within visions, the whole carnival [...] wondering how it all fit together. The visions of the two main characters were shortly addressed, distinguishing between violent and benign visions, but parallels between the visions and the beings of good and evil were not necessarily drawn. The characters' stories were described as unfolding in [...] "zig-zagging starts, <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in time and space, dropping oblique clues along the way." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{progresses}} mostly through footage streamed from a fixed {{camera in}} booth {{nine of the}} call centre setting. Streams from other cameras are displayed {{on the side of}} the screen, in the style of a CCTV feed. The idea was inspired by a clip of a serial killer's interview with the CIA which Shearsmith had seen online; this, too, had a main feed with three smaller feeds giving different views of the scene. The writers felt that the multiple screens both served a narrative function and raised the tension. For much of the episode, viewers simply watch characters taking calls. Extras are seen <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in the smaller screens, with Pemberton having initially been keen for things to be happening away from the main feed. However, he was somewhat frustrated with the result, with the same extra moving on numerous occasions throughout the episode. Shearsmith felt that a whole series filmed in the same manner [...] "would be a bit wearing on the eye", but that the style could be used for a single episode.|$|E
500|$|Fortitude South {{has been}} {{credited}} with ensuring the German 15th Army was not deployed against the Allied invasion force too soon and ensuring the success of Operation Overlord. Gerhard Weinberg stated that the Germans [...] "readily accepted the existence and location" [...] of FUSAG, believed {{the threat to the}} Pas de Calais was real and [...] "it was only at the end of July" [...] that they realized a second assault was not coming; [...] "by that time, {{it was too late to}} move reinforcements". However, Mary Barbier wrote [...] "it is time to consider that the importance of the deception has been overrated". She argues that 15th Army was largely immobile and not combat-ready, that despite the deception numerous German divisions – including the 1st SS Panzer Division, which was held in reserve behind the 15th Army – from across Europe were transferred to Normandy to repel the invasion, and that the Germans had realized as early as May that a real threat to Normandy existed. Barbier further commented that while the Germans believed the deception due to [...] "preconceived ideas about the importance of the Pas De Calais", the Allied staff had overestimated the effectiveness of the deception after the 15th Army's inaction because they held a [...] "preconceived notion of what FORTITUDE would accomplish". Following the Battle of Normandy, the phantom 80th Division was [...] "transferred" [...] around the east coast of England, <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between VII Corps and the equally bogus II Corps.

500|$|Many of the foraging, {{breeding}} and signaling behaviors of woodpeckers involve drumming and hammering using the bill. To prevent brain {{damage from the}} rapid and repeated impacts, woodpeckers {{have a number of}} physical features evolved to protect the brain. These include a relatively small and smooth brain, narrow subdural space, little cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounding it to prevent it from <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> inside the skull during pecking, the orientation of the brain within the skull (which maximises the contact area between the brain and the skull) and the short duration of contact. The skull consists of strong but compressible sponge-like bone which is most concentrated in the forehead and the back of the skull. Computer simulations have shown that 99.7 percent of the energy generated in pecking was stored in the form of strain energy, which was distributed throughout the bird's body, with only a small remaining fraction of the energy going into the brain. The pecking also heats up the woodpecker's skull, {{which is part of the}} reason why they often peck in short bursts with brief breaks in between, giving the head some time to cool. During the millisecond before contact with wood, a thickened nictitating membrane closes, protecting the eye from flying debris. These membranes also prevent the retina from tearing. The nostrils are also protected; they are often slit-like and have special feathers to cover them. Woodpeckers are capable of repeated pecking on a tree at high decelerations on the order of [...] (1000 g).|$|E
