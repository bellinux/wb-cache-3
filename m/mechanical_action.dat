5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the <b>mechanical</b> <b>action</b> of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E

In this chapter {{the focus of}} experimental techniques to verify crack sealing (recovery against environmental actions) or crack healing (recovery against <b>mechanical</b> <b>actions)</b> has been limited to techniques {{that have been used}} and reported in self-sealing and self-healing research. To get a look and feel of the topic the chapter starts with a section on techniques which can be used to examine crack healing such as microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Next, the attention shifts from observing that something has been repaired to how well the repair has been. Following the definitions set out in chapter one, a differentiatiion has been made between techniques to verify recovery against environmental or <b>mechanical</b> <b>actions.</b> For recovery against environmental actions it turns out that permeability tests are often applied, while for recovery against <b>mechanical</b> <b>actions</b> the regain in strength by mechanical testing is the preferred choice...|$|R

25|$|Snowflakes have a {{wide range}} of shapes, even as they fall; among these are: six-sided star-like dendrites, {{hexagonal}} needles, platelets and icy pellets. Once snow accumulates on the ground, the flakes immediately begin to undergo transformation (called metamorphosis), owing to temperature changes, sublimation, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>action.</b> Temperature changes may be from the ambient temperature, solar radiation, rainwater, wind, or the temperature of the material beneath the snow layer. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>action</b> includes wind and compaction. Over time, bulk snow tends to consolidate—its crystals become truncated from breaking apart or losing mass with sublimation directly from solid to gas and with freeze-thaw, causing them to combine as coarse and granular ice crystals. Colbeck reports that fresh, cold, and man-made snow all interact more directly with the base of a ski and increase friction, indicating the use of harder waxes. Conversely, older, warmer, and denser snows present lower friction, in part due to increased grain size, which better promotes a water film and a smoother surface of the snow crystals for which softer waxes are indicated.|$|E

Franklin and Nollet debated the nature of electricity, with Franklin supporting action at a distance and two qualitatively opposing types of electricity, and Nollet advocating <b>mechanical</b> <b>action</b> and a single type of electrical fluid.

25|$|Tooth {{whitening}} or tooth bleaching procedures {{attempt to}} lighten a tooth's color {{in either of}} two ways: by chemical or <b>mechanical</b> <b>action.</b> Working chemically, a bleaching agent is used to carry out an oxidation reaction in the enamel and dentin. The agents most commonly used to intrinsically change the color of teeth are hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Oxygen radicals from the peroxide in the whitening agents contact the stains in the interprismatic spaces within the enamel layer. When this occurs, stains will be bleached and the teeth now appear lighter in color. Teeth not only appear whiter but also reflect light in increased amounts, which makes the teeth appear brighter as well. Studies show that whitening does not produce any ultrastructural or microhardness changes in the dental tissues.|$|E

500|$|A bell {{hangs in}} the tower, made in England from iron and steel and lined with silver. Early in the church's history, the Archdeacon of Chichester (later Cardinal Henry Edward Manning) {{provided}} communion vessels copied from a 12th-century coffin of the Bishop of Chichester, a fact recorded in inscriptions on the cups. St Andrew's east window commemorates James, Charlotte and Thomas Reibey (Archdeacon of Launceston for a time). The church features an organ, originally housed in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral, London. It was built by London organ builder J. C. Bishop around 1839, probably for a private owner. This dating is based partly on the organ's dedication plate's claim that Bishop was [...] "Organ Builder to her Majesty" [...] Queen Victoria, a claim that Bishop did not make until around this time.

Some moths produce ultrasonic clicks that were once thought to have a role in jamming bat echolocation. The ultrasonic clicks were subsequently found to be produced mostly by unpalatable moths to warn bats, just as warning colorations are used against predators that hunt by sight. Some otherwise palatable moths have evolved to mimic these calls. More recently, the claim that some moths can jam bat sonar has been revisited. Ultrasonic recording and high-speed infrared videography of bat-moth interactions suggest the palatable tiger moth really does defend against attacking big brown bats using ultrasonic clicks that jam bat sonar.|$|E

40|$|A direct {{one-dimensional}} {{beam model}} is adopted. Kinematics {{is described by}} axis displacement, rigid rotation of the cross-section and an average measure of warping.

In addition to the standard inner constraint of shear indeformability, a linear relationship between twist and warping is assumed. To obtain field equations in terms of displacements, non-linear hyperelastic constitutive relations are formulated.
