40|$|We {{describe}} a revised formal lithostratigraphy for the Sant Corneli Formation (Upper Cretaceous, Santonian) {{on the northern}} flank of the Sant Corneli Anticline, ENE of Tremp, southern Central Pyrenees. The formation comprises a carbonate platform succession, which overlies the platform deposits of the Montagut limestones, and is overlain by the basinal Herba-savina clays and marls. Five members are recognized in the formation, three of which are included in a newly defined type section {{in the western part}} of the outcrop. This section (196 m) exposes a lower and an upper tongue of the Aramunt Vell Member, separated by an eastward-thickening wedge consisting of the Sant Pere de Vilanoveta Member (new name) and overlying l’Aubagueta Member (new name). The Aramunt Vell Member comprises numerous coarsening-up cycles, each a few metres thick, of nodular silty marls and yellow-brown weathering, miliolid-rich bioclastic calcarenites. Its two tongues unite westwards to encompass the entire thickness of the formation. The Sant Pere de Vilanoveta Member contains coarsening-up cycles of coral-rich marls and <b>marly</b> <b>limestones,</b> rudist lithosomes and bioclastic floatstones and grainstones. The l’Aubagueta Member contains <b>marly</b> <b>limestones</b> and silty clays. Eastwards, two further members represent slope deposits that originally adjoined the platform, though now separated from it by a NW-SE trending normal fault. The Llau de Castellet Member (new name) comprises orange-brown marls and <b>marly</b> <b>limestones</b> laterally equivalent to the lower Aramunt Vell tongue. The overlying Llau de Joncarlat Member (new name) consists of white marls and <b>marly</b> <b>limestones,</b> laterally equivalent to the remaining platform units. Former names incompatible with this revised scheme, hence rejected herein, are the Carreu Formation and el Grau and Prats de Carreu members...|$|R

These yielded a well-defined magnetostratigraphy with the characteristic magnetization carried by hematite in red sediments and magnetite in white sediments. The polarity sequence is correlated to the magnetostratigraphy of Kimmeridgian-Tithonian-Berriasian pelagic carbonates of northern Italy and southern Spain, allowing precise biostratigraphic age correlations. The Berriasian/Tithonian boundary occurs within {{the upper half of}} Core 90, the late Tithonian/early Tithonian boundary at the base of Core 96, and the Tithonian/Kimmeridgian boundary at the top of Core 102. Correlations are also made to M- 16 through M- 22 of the marine magnetic anomaly M-sequence. Poor recovery and irregular magnetic properties of the underlying Kimmeridgian-Oxfordian-Callovian marls and claystones prevented determination of a polarity sequence, but the entire interval has mixed polarity.

40|$|The stratigraphic {{architecture}} of the Bolognano Formation documents {{the evolution of the}} Majella carbonate platform in response to global and local changes that affected the Mediterranean area during the Oligocene– Miocene interval. The Bolognano Formation consists of a homoclinal rampthat developed in a warm, subtropical environment. Five different lithofacies associations have been identified: Lepidocyclina calcarenites, cherty <b>marly</b> <b>limestones,</b> bryozon calcarenites, hemipelagic marls and <b>marly</b> <b>limestones,</b> and Lithothamnion limestones. Each association corresponds to a single lithostratigraphic unit except for the Lepidocyclina calcarenites that form two distinct lithostratigraphic units (Lepidocyclina calcarenites 1 and 2). These six units reflect alternation of shallow-water carbonate production and drowning. Specifically, two of the three stages of shallow-water carbonate production regard the development of wide dune fieldswithin the middle ramp, one stage dominated by red algae and a seagrass carbonate factory, whereas the two drowning phases are represented by <b>marly</b> cherty <b>limestones</b> and calcareous marls. A new biostratigraphic framework for Bolognano Formation is presented, based on highresolution analysis of calcareous nannofossil assemblages, which proved to be very useful for biostratigraphic constraints also in shallow-water settings. Using this approach, we have linked the first drowning phase, late Chattian–Aquitanian p. p. in age, towestern Mediterranean volcanismand the Mi- 1 event, and the second drowning phase, late Burdigalian–Serravallian in age, to the closure of the Indo-Pacific passage and the occurrence of the global Monterey event.
