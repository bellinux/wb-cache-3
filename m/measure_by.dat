5|$|In October 1998, Arena left DC United {{to coach}} the U.S. men's {{national}} team. Arena's departure {{marked the beginning of}} a downturn in the team's fortunes. While the club again won the MLS Cup in 1999 under coach Thomas Rongen, lackluster results in 2000 and 2001 led to Rongen's departure and his replacement by Ray Hudson in 2002. The team did not, however, fare much better under Hudson, and Piotr Nowak replaced him {{before the start of the}} 2004 season. The club's first season under Nowak was marred by injuries in the early going, and some players were known to have complained about Nowak's methods. Nevertheless, a strong finish, assisted in large <b>measure</b> <b>by</b> the late-season acquisition of Argentine midfielder Christian Gómez, who helped to propel United into the playoffs as the second seed. There they advanced past the New England Revolution on penalty kicks in what has been called one of the best games in MLS history. United then defeated the Kansas City Wizards to win their fourth MLS Cup. United's attendance record at RFK Stadium is 54,282, in a match against the Tampa Bay Mutiny in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Meeting on {{the third}} day of the special session, Democratic factions within the General Assembly reached a {{compromise}} budget.

The plan also included a requirement to use half of that for direct relief toward New Jersey's property tax—highest of all states. The plan also called for the same dedicated purpose for all of the money raised by this sales tax increase in subsequent years. The new budget law included a provision for a constitutional amendment which was required, like all such amendments in the state, to be approved in an Election Day referendum.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} central conreal thickness(CCT) using EX 500 Excimer Laser workstation(EX 500) in laser in situ keratomileusis(LASIK) patients. METHODS: The CCT of 120 eyes(63 patients) who had LASIK between January 2013 and June 2013 were <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> A-scan and EX 500. Three groups were classified: > 550 μm, 500 ～ 550 μm, t test. RESULTS: The average preoperative CCT value was 527. 9 ± 34. 3 μm <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> A-scan, 528. 5 ± 34. 6 μm <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> EX 500. There {{was no significant difference}} between these two measurements(t = 1. 736, P = 0. 085). In group which CCT > 550 μm, the average preoperative CCT value was 571. 4 ± 17. 3 μm <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> A-scan, 572. 7 ± 15. 7 μm <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> EX 500. There {{was no significant difference between}} these two measurements(t = 1. 857, P = 0. 072). In group which CCT 500 ～ 550 μm, the average preoperative CCT value was 523. 4 ± 13. 1 μm <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> A-scan, 524. 2 ± 12. 4 μm <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> EX 500. There was no significant difference between these two measurements(t = 1. 934, P = 0. 058). In group which CCT t = 1. 395, P = 0. 174). The average CCT value after corneal flap lifting was 401. 3 ± 34. 2 μm <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> A-scan, 393. 4 ± 38. 9 μm <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> EX 500. There was a significant difference between these two measurements(t = 6. 669, P = 0. 000). The average thickness of the corneal bed stroma value after keratomileusis was 332. 6 ± 38. 3 μm <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> A-scan, 307. 3 ± 37. 1 μm <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> EX 500. There was a significant difference between these two measurements(t = 17. 165, P = 0. 000). CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference between preoperative CCT value <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> A-scan and EX 500.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the management controllable factors that determine bank’s profitability of the Jordanian commercial banks listed in Amman Stock of Exchange (ASE). For this, the bank-specific variables are derived from the income statements and the balance sheets of commercial banks published in ASE. Excluding Islamic banks, thirteen Jordanian commercial banks listed in ASE since 2000 were selected (91 observations) over the 2005 - 2011 intervals. This paper uses descriptive analysis(includes the mean, minimum, maximum, median and standard deviation), financial ratios analysis, Pearson correlation analysis,regression analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the natural logarithm to implicate the results with the hypotheses. The factors taken into consideration are Profitability <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> ROA, <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> Cost efficiency CIR, <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> Liquidity LADST, <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> Credit Composition <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> NCTA, Credit Risk <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> PRCF, Capital adequacy <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> TETA and the Bank Size <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> SZE.
