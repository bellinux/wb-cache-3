In natural conditions, soil acts as a <b>mineral</b> <b>nutrient</b> reservoir but the soil itself is not essential to plant growth. When the mineral nutrients in the soil are dissolved in water, plant roots absorb nutrients readily, soil is no longer required for the plant to thrive. This observation {{is the basis for}} hydroponics, the growing of plants in a water solution rather than soil, which has become a standard technique in biological research, teaching lab exercises, crop production and as a hobby.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Earth's {{elements}} and minerals (or mineral nutrients) are {{contained within the}} tissues and diets of organisms. Hence, mineral and nutrient cycles trace food web energy pathways. Ecologists employ stoichiometry to analyze the ratios {{of the main elements}} found in all organisms: carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P). There is a large transitional difference between many terrestrial and aquatic systems as C:P and C:N ratios are much higher in terrestrial systems while N:P ratios are equal between the two systems. Mineral nutrients are the material resources that organisms need for growth, development, and vitality. Food webs depict the pathways of <b>mineral</b> <b>nutrient</b> cycling as they flow through organisms. Most of the primary production in an ecosystem is not consumed, but is recycled by detritus back into useful nutrients. Many of the Earth's microorganisms are involved in the formation of minerals in a process called biomineralization. Bacteria that live in detrital sediments create and cycle nutrients and biominerals. Food web models and nutrient cycles have traditionally been treated separately, but there is a strong functional connection between the two in terms of stability, flux, sources, sinks, and recycling of mineral nutrients.|$|E

50|$|Most {{minerals}} are inorganic in nature. <b>Mineral</b> <b>nutrients</b> {{refers to}} the smaller class of minerals that are metabolized for growth, development, and vitality of living organisms. <b>Mineral</b> <b>nutrients</b> are recycled by bacteria that are freely suspended in the vast water columns of the worlds oceans. They absorb dissolved organic matter containing <b>mineral</b> <b>nutrients</b> as they scavenge through the dying individuals that fall out of large phytoplankton blooms. Flagellates are effective bacteriovores and are also commonly found in the marine water column. The flagellates are preyed upon by zooplankton while the phytoplankton concentrates on the larger particulate matter that is suspended {{in the water column}} as they are consumed by larger zooplankton, with fish as the top predator. <b>Mineral</b> <b>nutrients</b> cycle through this marine food chain, from bacteria and phytoplankton to flagellates and zooplankton which are then eaten by fish. The bacteria are important in this chain because only they have the physiological ability to absorb the dissolved <b>mineral</b> <b>nutrients</b> from the sea. These recycling principals from marine environments apply to many soil and freshwater ecosystems as well. In terrestrial ecosystems, fungi play similar roles as bacteria: they mobilize nutritional elements composing matter that is inaccessible for other organisms and transport acquired nutrients to nutritionally scarce patches of ecosystem.|$|R
50|$|A {{nutrient}} cycle (or ecological recycling) is {{the movement and}} exchange of organic and inorganic matter back into the production of living matter. The process is regulated by food web pathways that decompose matter into <b>mineral</b> <b>nutrients.</b> Nutrient cycles occur within ecosystems. Ecosystems are interconnected systems where matter and energy flows and is exchanged as organisms feed, digest, and migrate about. <b>Minerals</b> and <b>nutrients</b> accumulate in varied densities and uneven configurations across the planet. Ecosystems recycle locally, converting <b>mineral</b> <b>nutrients</b> into the production of biomass, and {{on a larger scale}} they participate in a global system of inputs and outputs where matter is exchanged and transported through a larger system of biogeochemical cycles.|$|R

40|$|Geophagia, the {{intentional}} and repeated ingestion of soil material, {{is a complex}} eating behaviour with incomprehensible aetiology. It is generally assumed that geophagia may help supplement <b>mineral</b> <b>nutrients</b> and thus should not be dissuaded, particularly in subsistence communities. This is largely {{based on the assumption}} that a large proportion of <b>mineral</b> <b>nutrients</b> in geophagic materials is potentially available for absorption in the body. We tested this hypothesis on five soils collected from geophagia-prevalent communities by using an in vitro soil ingestion simulation test that is broadly similar to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The results show that, despite the soils being rich in <b>mineral</b> <b>nutrients,</b> soil ingestion, inadvertent or through geophagia can potentially reduce the absorption of already bioavailable nutrients, particularly micronutrients such as Fe, Cu and Zn. These in vitro findings, while disagreeing with the commonly held view of geophagia as a source of nutrient supplementation, are consistent with micronutrient deficiency problems observed in clinical nutrition studies conducted amongst geophagic populations. The work also showed that, in some cases, the ingested soils may become a source of Ca, Mg and Mn, although it is not clear why other similar soils should not release any of these <b>mineral</b> <b>nutrients...</b>|$|R
