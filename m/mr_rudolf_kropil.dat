50|$|On 7 December 1829 Robert married Anne Kirkwood, {{the only}} child of John Kirkwood. Together they had 14 {{children}}, three of whom died in infancy. Excluding these three, their children were Robert (Robert Chambers (publisher born 1832)), Nina (Mrs. Frederick Lehmann, and mother of Rudolf Chambers Lehmann), Mary (Mrs. Alexander Mackenzie Edwards, mother of Bob Edwards), Anne (Mrs. Dowie, mother of Ménie Muriel Dowie), Janet, Eliza (Mrs. William Overend Priestley), Amelia (<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Rudolf</b> Lehmann), James, William, Phoebe (Mrs. Zeigler), and Alice.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mr.</b> (<b>Rudolf)</b> Schwann — Arthur Jensen - He {{has worked}} {{his entire life}} at [...] "Damernes Magasin" [...] and is utterly {{incapable}} of adapting to any new situation. He is an extremely proxy snob, who ends up living at Mrs. Vinther's and working as a debt collector until his death. Even though it is never clearly stated in the series, he is a closeted homosexual as he never shows any interest in women and doesn't have a physical relationship with Violet Vinther.|$|R
40|$|In {{this short}} paper we list the herpetological {{specimens}} collected in southern Surinam (Dutch Guiana) by <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Rudolf</b> Freund in November and December, 1961, and include ecological notes {{made by the}} Freunds at the time. This area is one from which collections are rare, so that distributional data are generally unavailable. Of special interest is the seemingly common occurrence there, and in adjacent parts of Guyana (formerly British Guiana), of giant specimens of the toad Bufo marinus, of such length and weight to indicate that these animals are the “world's largest toads”. The collecting localities are shown on the outline map (Fig. 200) and available habitat data are given in the species list...|$|R
5000|$|Ultimately, Leopold and Rudolf left {{a legacy}} of over ten {{thousand}} glass models scattered across museums the world over, mostly maritime but with the Flowers as the most famous, all continuing to inspire both scientists and glass artists alike. They and their spouses were buried together in the Hosterwitz cemetery in Dresden. Finally and in welcome addition, [...] "the Corning Museum and the Botanical Museum of Harvard University jointly purchased the remaining Blaschka studio materials from Gertrud Pones, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Rudolf</b> (Frieda) Blaschka’s niece, in 1993," [...] thus granting the world access to their workbench and sketches as well; {{in part due to}} the pure good fortune that said studio survived the Bombing of Dresden in World War II (luck not shared by the original collection of glass sea anemones purchased by Professor Reichenbach).|$|R
40|$|In his book, The Art of Plain Talk, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rudolf</b> Flesch makes many assertions {{which seem}} convincingly {{plausible}} {{on the face}} of them, but which prove to be oversimplifications or plain distortions of fact if one troubles to look beneath the surface. Good examples are the comparisons he is fond of drawing between English and other languages. He tells us, for instance, that Modern Persian 2 ̆ 2 has done away with articles, 2 ̆ 2 and admires that as 2 ̆ 2 exactly the same simplification [that] is being used today by our headline writers. 2 ̆ 2 Now of course the telegraphic style of newspaper headlines serves its purpose well enough most of the time, but it is frequently misleading as to the real content of the news, and occasionally produces amusing ambiguities. English has no monopoly on this telescoped style, and some languages are better equipped to handle it than ours is. As for 2 ̆ 2 doing away with articles, 2 ̆ 2 the gradual evolution of the function of the definite article in modern languages is a very interesting study which we cannot go into here. It has, however, made possible easy precision of expression for shades of meaning difficult to express otherwise...|$|R
6000|$|... [9] A correspondent, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rudolf</b> Cyrian, {{writes to}} correct me here, and I cannot do better, I think, than thank him and quote what he says. [...] "It is hardly right {{to state that}} fifty miles an hour 'is the limit of our speed for land travel, so far as {{existing}} conditions go.' As far as English traffic is concerned, the statement is approximately correct. In the United States, however, there are several trains running now which average over considerable distances more than sixty miles an hour, stoppages included, nor is there much reason why {{this should not be}} considerably increased. What especially hampers the development of railways in England--as compared with other countries--is the fact that the rolling-stock templet is too small. Hence carriages in England have to be narrower and lower than carriages in the United States, although both run on the same standard gauge (4 feet 8½ inches). The result is that several things which you describe as not possible at present, such as to 'write smoothly and easily at a steady table, read papers, have one's hair cut, and dine in comfort,' are not only feasible, but actually attained on some of the good American trains. For instance, on the present Empire State Express, running between New York and Buffalo, or on the present Pennsylvania, Limited, running between New York and Chicago, and on others. With the Pennsylvania, Limited, travel stenographers and typewriters, whose services are placed at the disposal of passengers free of charge. But the train on which there is the least vibration of any is probably the new Empire State Express, and on this it is certainly possible to write smoothly and easily at a steady table." ...|$|R
