5|$|The objects {{created by}} amphiphiles are usually spherical (as {{in the case}} of <b>micelles),</b> but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These {{anisotropic}} self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves {{in much the same way}} as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped <b>micelles).</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as <b>micelles</b> or inverted <b>micelles.</b> Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E
5|$|The {{content of}} water or other solvent {{molecules}} changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into <b>micelles</b> or vesicles. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.|$|E

The molecular <b>micelle</b> is used as a chiral selector in capillary electrophoresis. This study {{is part of a larger}} effort to understand the mechanism of chiral recognition in capillary electrophoresis by characterizing the molecular <b>micelle</b> binding of chiral compounds with different geometries and charges. Propranolol and atenolol were chosen because their structures are similar, but their chiral interactions with the molecular <b>micelle</b> are different. Molecular dynamics simulations showed both propranolol enantiomers inserted their aromatic rings into the molecular <b>micelle</b> core and that (S) -propranolol associated more strongly with the molecular <b>micelle</b> than (R) -propranolol.

The objective {{of this research was}} therefore to determine factors that influence average casein <b>micelle</b> size in milk from individual cows. Average casein <b>micelle</b> size of milk samples was associated with the A and B genetic variants of k-casein, and differences in concentration of glycosylated k-casein as a fraction of total milk protein. Milk samples with a low average casein <b>micelle</b> size were associated with the B variant of k-casein and a higher relative concentration of glycosylated k-casein, compared with milk samples with a high average casein <b>micelle</b> size.

25|$|When block {{copolymer}} <b>micelles</b> don't display the characteristic relaxation processes of surfactant <b>micelles,</b> these are called kinetically frozen <b>micelles.</b> These {{can be achieved}} in two ways: when the unimers forming the <b>micelles</b> are not soluble in the solvent of the micelle solution, or if the core forming blocks are glassy at the temperature in which the <b>micelles</b> are found. Kinetically frozen <b>micelles</b> are formed when either of these conditions is met. A special example in which both of these conditions are valid is that of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide). This {{block copolymer}} {{is characterized by the}} high hydrophobicity of the core forming block, PS, which causes the unimers to be insoluble in water. Moreover, PS has a high glass transition temperature which is, depending on the molecular weight, higher than room temperature. Thanks to these two characteristics, a water solution of PS-PEO <b>micelles</b> of sufficiently high molecular weight can be considered kinetically frozen. This means that none of the relaxation processes, which would drive the micelle solution towards thermodynamic equilibrium, are possible. Pioneering work on these <b>micelles</b> was done by Adi Eisenberg. It was also shown how the lack of relaxation processes allowed great freedom in the possible morphologies formed. Moreover, the stability against dilution and vast range of morphologies of kinetically frozen <b>micelles</b> make them particularly interesting, for example, for the development of long circulating drug delivery nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of these}} {{differences}} in the building blocks, some block copolymer <b>micelles</b> behave like surfactant ones, while others don't. It is necessary therefore {{to make a distinction}} between the two situations. The former ones will belong to the dynamic <b>micelles</b> while the latter will be called kinetically frozen <b>micelles.</b>|$|E
25|$|Certain {{amphiphilic}} {{block copolymer}} <b>micelles</b> display a similar behavior as surfactant <b>micelles.</b> These are generally called dynamic <b>micelles</b> and {{are characterized by}} the same relaxation processes assigned to surfactant exchange and micelle scission/recombination. Although the relaxation processes are the same between {{the two types of}} <b>micelles,</b> the kinetics of unimer exchange are very different. While in surfactant systems the unimers leave and join the <b>micelles</b> through a diffusion-controlled process, for copolymers the entry rate constant is slower than a diffusion controlled process. The rate of this process was found to be a decreasing power-law of the degree of polymerization of the hydrophobic block to the power 2/3. This difference is due to the coiling of the hydrophobic block of a copolymer exiting the core of a micelle.|$|E

The calculation results show that with increasing temperature, the change of chain-state in corona has little effect on the corona density, and the <b>micelle</b> aggregation number will rapidly increase with the slightly growing of the <b>micelle</b> radius, which implies the solvent squeezing from corona and the result is consistent with experiments.

25|$|<b>Micelles</b> {{composed}} of ionic surfactants have an electrostatic {{attraction to the}} ions that surround them in solution, the latter known as counterions. Although the closest counterions partially mask a charged micelle (by up to 90%), the effects of micelle charge affect {{the structure of the}} surrounding solvent at appreciable distances from the micelle. Ionic <b>micelles</b> influence many properties of the mixture, including its electrical conductivity.

25|$|Supermicelle is a {{hierarchical}} micelle structure (supramolecular assembly) where individual components are also <b>micelles.</b> Supermicelles are formed via bottom-up chemical approaches, such as self-assembly of long cylindrical <b>micelles</b> into radial cross-, star- or dandelion-like patterns in a specially selected solvent; solid nanoparticles may {{be added to}} the solution to act as nucleation centers and form the central core of the supermicelle.

40|$|We {{present a}} self-consistent field theory (SCFT) study of spherical <b>micelle</b> {{formation}} in {{a blend of}} poly(styrene-butadiene) diblocks and homopolystyrene. The <b>micelle</b> core radii, corona thicknesses and critical <b>micelle</b> concentrations are calculated as functions of the polymer molecular weights and {{the composition of the}} diblocks. Our results are compared with an earlier scaling theory and with X-ray scattering data. The agreement between self-consistent field theory and experiment for the <b>micelle</b> structure is sometimes quantitative and is generally more successful than scaling theory. For copolymers with relatively light core blocks, SCFT predictions for the critical <b>micelle</b> concentration improve over those of scaling theories by an order of magnitude.
