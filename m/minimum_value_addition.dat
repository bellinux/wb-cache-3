40|$|An {{oriented}} graph G^σ is a digraph without loops and multiple arcs, where G {{is called the}} underlying graph of G^σ. Let S(G^σ) denote the skew-adjacency matrix of G^σ. The rank of the skew-adjacency matrix of G^σ is called the skew-rank of G^σ, denoted by sr(G^σ). The skew-adjacency matrix of an {{oriented graph}} is skew symmetric and the skew-rank is even. In this paper we consider the skew-rank of simple oriented graphs. Firstly we give some preliminary results about the skew-rank. Secondly we characterize the oriented graphs with skew-rank 2 and characterize the oriented graphs with pendant vertices which attain the skew-rank 4. As a consequence, we list the oriented unicyclic graphs, the oriented bicyclic graphs with pendant vertices which attain the skew-rank 4. Moreover, we determine the skew-rank of oriented unicyclic graphs of order n with girth k in terms of matching number. We investigate the <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of the skew-rank among oriented unicyclic graphs of order n with girth k and characterize oriented unicyclic graphs attaining the <b>minimum</b> <b>value.</b> In <b>addition,</b> we consider oriented unicyclic graphs whose skew-adjacency matrices are nonsingular.

Validity of these constructs were investigated by confirmatory factor analysis. A sample of 330 manufacturing firms from Bangladesh were analyzed to determine validity of the measurement model. Partial Least Squares (PLS) tool was used to evaluate the validity and scale of strategic capability, sourcing strategy and firm performance.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{focuses on}} the pressure amplitude response, within two deep cavities characterized by their length over depth ratios (L/H = 0. 2 and 0. 41), under varying free stream velocity in a large wind tunnel. Experiments have shown that for deep rectangular cavities at low Mach number, oscillations of discrete frequencies can be produced. These oscillations appear when the free stream velocity becomes higher than a <b>minimum</b> <b>value.</b> In <b>addition,</b> as flow velocity is increased, upward jumps in oscillation frequency are observed in the two cavity configurations. Convection velocity of instabilities along the shear layer was measured using velocity cross-correlations. This study shows that the hydrodynamic modes of the cavity shear layer are correctly predicted by the Rossiter model when the convection velocity is determined and the empirical time delay is neglected. For L/H = 0. 2 the first oscillation mode is observed on the spectrogram. For L/H = 0. 41, both {{the first and the}} second mode have approximately the same amplitude. Time-resolved Particle image velocimetry measurements were performed to obtain the vorticity distribution during the oscillation cycle along the cavity shear layer. It is found that the number of structures in the cavity shear layer depends on the mode order of cavity oscillation...|$|R
