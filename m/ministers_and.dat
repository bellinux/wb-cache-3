5|$|Following the Constitution of May 3, 1791, the senate's competences were altered; in {{most cases}} the {{senators}} could only vote together with the sejm, and the senate's veto powers were limited.

The king, who nominated senators, <b>ministers</b> <b>and</b> other officials, presided over the senate, and could propose new laws together with the executive government, over which he also presided (the newly created Straż Praw or the Guardianship of Laws).
