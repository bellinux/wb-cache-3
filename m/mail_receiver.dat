5000|$|SMTP is a connection-oriented, text-based {{protocol}} {{in which}} a mail sender communicates with a <b>mail</b> <b>receiver</b> by issuing command strings and supplying necessary data over a reliable ordered data stream channel, typically a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. An SMTP session consists of commands originated by an SMTP client (the initiating agent, sender, or transmitter) and corresponding responses from the SMTP server (the listening agent, or receiver) so that the session is opened, and session parameters are exchanged. A session may include zero or more SMTP transactions. An SMTP transaction consists of three command/reply sequences: ...|$|E
50|$|Lots were {{originally}} surveyed in 1900 {{to serve the}} nearby Murrin Murrin Copper Mine that {{was known as the}} Anaconda Copper Mine at the time. By 1903 there were 64 residential lots and a population of about 350. A police station was also established in 1903 and the town boasted two hotels, two stores a chemist and a newsagent. A <b>mail</b> <b>receiver</b> was in place but no telegraph station. The townsite was originally gazetted as Anaconda in 1904, but the name was changed in 1907 after a request from the WA Copper company because of confusion in the London markets between Copper shipments from Anaconda in the United States and shipments from the local mine. The name was changed to the Aboriginal name for the area, Eulaminna, in 1907.|$|E
40|$|This memo {{provides}} {{information for the}} Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. SMTP [SMTP] [HOST-REQ] and its service extensions [ESMTP] provide a mechanism for transferring mail reliably and efficiently. The design of the SMTP protocol effectively requires the server to manage a mail delivery queue. In some limited circumstances, outside the area of mail exchange between independent hosts on public networks, it is desirable to implement a system where a <b>mail</b> <b>receiver</b> does not manage a queue. This document describes the LMTP protocol for transporting mail into such systems. Although LMTP is an alternative protocol to ESMTP, it uses (with a few changes) the syntax and semantics of ESMTP. This design permit...|$|E

5000|$|DMARC {{policies}} are published by domain owners and applied by <b>mail</b> <b>receivers</b> to the messages that don't pass the alignment test. The domain being queried {{is the author}} domain, that is the domain {{to the right of}} [...] in the [...] header field. The policy can be one of [...] the so-called monitor mode, [...] to treat the message with suspicion according to the receiver capabilities, or [...] to reject the message outright. Reject policy is fine for domains that don't have individual human users, or for companies with firm staff policies that all mail goes through the company mail server, and employees don't join mailing lists and the like using company addresses, or the company provides a separate less strictly managed domain for its staff mail. Strict policies will never be appropriate for public webmail systems where the users will use their mail addresses any way one can use a mail address.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Nowadays one of {{the major}} {{problems}} by Internet users, who they have email addresses, are undesirable emails (also known as spam). Spam emails generally with profitable reasons are sent to the large number of email addresses. A spammer, who sends spam, tries to run an advertisement for companies or products. The problem with these spams is that they waste the network resources. In this paper a method is presented to stop spam emails in the sender side. In this method, the sender mail server checks any email based on some pre-defined criteria. If the sender mail server determines that the email is not spam, it will deliver that mail to associated mail server. Otherwise, the email is blocked in the sender mail server. In this method the waste of network resources such as time, allocated memory, and bandwidth are preserved.

40|$|Abstract — Intranet mail {{system allows}} {{members of an}} {{organization}} to send or receive mails among them. But the sender don’t know whether the sent mail is viewed by the receiver in time or not, the response for the <b>mail</b> in the <b>receiver</b> side and so on, unless he receive a mail or message personally from the receiver. So this Self Acknowledgeable Intranet Mail System has been designed and implemented to benefit the sender {{about the status of}} his mail. Once a mail is sent, the sender can know the receiver activity in the mail system until the mail is viewed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{concept of}} {{steganography}} {{is used in}} the paper to transmit the data secretly and safely from one user to another as it hides the data behind image. In this sender encrypt data using AES algorithm, hides encrypted data in image using LSB technique and the system auto generate the hide key. Sender sends the file with the help of existing <b>mailing</b> system. <b>Receiver</b> can perform action based on key like if he is having only data hiding then he can only get the image in original form and if he have data hiding and data decryption key then {{he will be able to}} get the original data, it also provides protection for the keys. All these are done with proper login process. The system generates fake data if the user is not authenticated in the process of login. In such a way only the authorized user, who was supposed to get the keys, is able to get the original data. Keyword- Data encryption, AES, LSB technique. I...|$|R
40|$|Unsolicited Bulk Emails (also {{known as}} Spam) are {{undesirable}} emails sent to massive number of users. Spam emails consume the network resources and cause lots of security uncertainties. As we studied, the location where the spam filter operates in {{is an important}} parameter to preserve network resources. Although {{there are many different}} methods to block spam emails, most of program developers only intend to block spam emails from being delivered to their clients. In this paper, we will introduce a new and efficient approach to prevent spam emails from being transferred. The result shows that if we focus on developing a filtering method for spams emails in the sender mail server rather than the <b>receiver</b> <b>mail</b> server, we can detect the spam emails in the shortest time consequently to avoid wasting network resources.

40|$|One {{side effect}} of the {{on-going}} popularity of the Internet is the increasing abuse of it. Now that commercial organizations have discovered the world's largest communication network, they try to utilize it for their purposes. While this is no problem in principle, the way this is sometimes done is a problem. The delivery of advertisements via mass email {{is becoming more and}} more popular. For company salesmen, it may seem natural to use this approach to reach potential customers | after all, delivering commercial ads via electronic mail is just the same as delivering normal advertisement brochures. There are fundamental differences, though. The most important one, is that electronic mail can be delivered in millions of copies without any effort. The delivery process is not free, though, it is paid for by] the organization running the network and, most notably, the users and recipients of the <b>mail.</b> Hence, the <b>receiver</b> of an unsolicited commercial email is paying for receiving it [...] ...|$|R
