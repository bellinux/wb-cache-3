The concentrations of lead and zinc of some soil samples were at elevated levels, with the highest concentration being 2000 mg/kg (the EPA standard limits for both metals is 300 mg/kg at residential soils). The physical and chemical properties of soils, including soil particle size distribution, soil cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil specific surface area (SSA), soil permeability coefficients, were determined.

In this experiment, we compare phytoextraction and phytostabilisation technologies on a soil contaminated by Cd and Zn fallouts {{from a former}} Zn smelter. 	Lolium perenne plants were cultivated for 2 months under controlled conditions in a 27. 6 dm³-pot experiment filled with the contaminated soil. A leachate tank below the soil compartment allowed the collect of leachates. The heavy metals phytoextraction was promoted by adding Na-EDTA (0. 5 g. kg- 1) in watering solution 4 days after germination. Phytostabilisation was assessed by mixing soil with steel shots (1 %) before Lolium perenne sowing. Plants, soils and leachates were regularly monitored during 2 months for plant growth, leachate volume, elemental concentrations (Ca, Cd, Fe, K, Mg, Na and Zn), pH and electrical conductivity. 	Shoot biomass was low, because of high heavy metal toxicity. Presence of plants exacerbated heavy metal leaching, by improving soil hydraulic conductivity. Use of EDTA for phytoextraction increased heavy metal <b>mobility</b> <b>in</b> <b>soil,</b> leading to higher concentration of heavy metal in shoots. Moreover, biomass production was also increased despite higher Cd and Zn concentration in shoots, because EDTA was able to reduce metal toxicity in plant tissues. However, this higher heavy metal extraction was insufficient to significantly reduce the heavy metal content in soil, and did not justify the important leaching induced by EDTA. 	On the other hand, addition of steel shots decreased efficiently both CaCl 2 (0. 01 M) extraction of Cd and Zn, and therefore heavy metal <b>mobility</b> <b>in</b> <b>soil,</b> and their leaching. This input improved also shoot biomass production. However, improvement of growth conditions by steel shots led to higher heavy metal mass in shoot tissues.
