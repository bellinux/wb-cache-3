5|$|When GHQ {{moved up}} to Brisbane, LHQ {{remained}} behind in Melbourne, but Blamey formed an Advanced LHQ under his Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS), Major General George Alan Vasey, which moved to nearby St Lucia. Major General Frank Berryman replaced Vasey as DCGS in September 1942, and remained in the post until January 1944. He resumed the post in July 1944 and remained until December 1945. When the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of GHQ moved to Hollandia, Advanced LHQ followed, opening there on 15 December, but when the main GHQ moved to Leyte in February 1945, Advanced LHQ remained behind. A Forward Echelon LHQ was formed under Berryman that remained co-located with the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of GHQ, while the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of LHQ remained at Hollandia until it moved to Morotai for the operations in Borneo in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|By 1807, further {{investigation}} revealed two new {{objects in the}} region: Juno and Vesta. The burning of Lilienthal in the Napoleonic wars, where the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of work had been done, brought this first period of discovery to a close.|$|E

The <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of the German force {{was located in}} the forested region around Lohsa. The Germans continued their push toward Königswartha and Hoyerswerda.|$|E
5|$|He was wrong; the Austrians {{engaged with}} the French advance guard {{numbered}} closer to 50,000, and constituted the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of Charles' army, not its advance guard. In the night, Charles also had moved additional troops {{to renew the}} attack on the Pfullendorf heights at daybreak.|$|E

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of the table, {{at the end of}} each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of the table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|Located {{after the}} <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of stories is a {{selection}} of art pieces that represent interpretations of the Halo universe {{from a number of}} comic book artists. These contributors include Doug Alexander, Rick Berry, Geof Darrow, and more than twenty-five others, both freelance and from Bungie Studios—including lead composer Martin O'Donnell.|$|E
5|$|Major Patrick Ferguson was {{appointed}} Inspector of Militia on May 22, 1780. His {{task was to}} march to the old Tryon County area, raise and organize Loyalist units from the Tory population of the Carolina Backcountry, and protect the left flank of Lord Cornwallis' <b>main</b> <b>body</b> at Charlotte, North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Temnospondyls' {{vertebrae}} {{are divided}} into several segments. In living tetrapods, the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of the vertebra is {{a single piece of}} bone called the centrum, but in temnospondyls, this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum. Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls: stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae.'In rhachitomous vertebrae, the intercentra are large and wedge-shaped, and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them.' Both elements support a spine-like neural arch, and well-developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae. The strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially, and in some cases fully, terrestrial. In stereospondylous vertebrae, the pleurocentra have been lost entirely, with the intercentra enlarged as the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of the vertebrae. This weaker type of backbone indicates that stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water.|$|E
5|$|The Meccan army {{positioned}} itself {{facing the}} Muslim lines, with the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> led by Abu Sufyan, {{and the left}} and right flanks commanded by Ikrimah ibn Abi-Jahl and Khalid ibn al-Walid respectively. 'Amr ibn al-'As was named the commander of cavalry and his task was to coordinate attack between the cavalry wings.|$|E
5|$|The {{imposing}} {{scene was}} at the Long Bridge, where the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of the troops crossed.

5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>body</b> {{continued}} to Antwerp. Some 12–30 German fighters attacked the airfield from 09:25 to 09:40. The ground defences were alert and the German formations attacked in a disorganised manner. 145 Wing RAF was missed completely and considering {{the large number}} of targets the destruction was light; just 12 Spitfires were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of {{a cannon}} {{consists}} of three basic extensions: the foremost and the longest is called the chase, the middle portion is the reinforce, and the closest and briefest portion is the cascabel or cascable.|$|E

5|$|A Japanese raiding party {{destroyed}} the bridge over Tuliahan River; Chase's security {{was not good}} enough. This prevented the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of the 1st Cavalry Division from linking up with Chase's force in Manila. Supplies were dispatched through the 37th Infantry Division's zone until engineers could build a new bridge. For his advance on Manila, Chase was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. He was also awarded the Purple Heart for the burns to his hands.|$|E
5|$|After {{building}} boats, Lochry {{and his men}} set {{off from}} Wheeling, hoping {{to catch up with}} the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> of the expedition. Meanwhile, Clark left Major Charles Cracraft with provisions and a small group of men on Camp Three Island to await Lochry's arrival. Further down the Ohio, Clark stopped at the mouth of the Kanawha River, but again he decided to keep moving in order to prevent desertion. Clark left a letter fastened to a pole which instructed Lochry to keep following.|$|E
5|$|As in all arthropods, the chelicerate {{body has}} a very small coelom {{restricted}} to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems. The <b>main</b> <b>body</b> cavity is a hemocoel that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects blood from the rear and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body, they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E
25|$|Essentially, {{emergency}} medicine in Germany heavily relies on evidence based guidelines {{provided by the}} <b>main</b> <b>bodies</b> of medical scientific organisations. Providers of (emergency) medicine have {{to keep up with}} the changes in those guidelines.|$|R
