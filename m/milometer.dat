5000|$|An {{odometer}} or odograph is {{an instrument}} for measuring the distance travelled by a vehicle, such as a bicycle or automobile. The device may be electronic, mechanical, {{or a combination of}} the two. The noun derives from the Greek words hodós ("path" [...] or [...] "gateway") and métron ("measure"). In countries where Imperial units or US customary units are used, it is sometimes called a mileometer or <b>milometer,</b> the former name especially being prevalent in the United Kingdom and members of the Commonwealth.|$|E
40|$|Acloudfree A VHRR {{composite}} of South-East Asia at one <b>Milometer</b> resolution has been producedfrom 38 selected daily NOAA- 11 AVHRR images. Geometric accuracy of about 1 pixel is achieved using a two-step rectffication algorithm (orbital model and transformation by ground control points). A spatial and spectral enhancement has been performed, the sea masked out and political boundaries included in thefinal product. This AVHRR composite is particularly useftdfor a comprehensive overview of land cover at a regional scale. Qualitative comparison between a monthly composite and the existingforest maps highlights theforest cover change {{and points out}} the hot spots where the maps have to be updated...|$|E
50|$|The Great Morava Valley is {{the valley}} of the Great Morava River. It is often {{referred}} to only as the Morava Valley (Serbian Pomoravlje District is located in the southern area of the Great Morava Valley). It the beginning, it is bounded by the mountains of Juhor on the west and Kučaj on the east. In the later section, the Morava Valley gets much wider, with only smaller hills bounding it and opens widely to the Danube and Banat region, across the river. It covers an area of 4,360 square <b>milometers,</b> which is over 70% of the entire Great Morava watershed.|$|R
5000|$|The Hickory Creek Wilderness {{contains}} one official, but primitive hiking trail, a 12.1 mile (19.5 kilometer)loop with {{an entrance}} trail of approximately 1.7 miles (2.7 <b>milometers)</b> which leaves the Heart's Content Road (State Route 2002) {{about a quarter}} mile north of the campground. The Forest Service has decided to do minimal maintenance on the trail to [...] "preserve wilderness character". meaning that its infrequent blazes {{have been allowed to}} fade and that blowdown is common. Additionally, unblazed trails, largely old railroad grades, can be found along the scenic Middle and East Forks of Hickory Creek, though a 1985 tornado has made some sections impassable.|$|R
50|$|Specialization {{could be}} found in the bluish-green figurines found at Pikillaqta. Two {{different}} sets of 40 votive turquoise figurines were found in grave lots. This was an important number because it showed state organization as an administrative unit and rank. These were also the only figurines found so far from the Middle Horizon period. The figurines ranged in size from 18 to 52 <b>milometers.</b> There were turquois processing locations and workshops at Pikillaqta. Stone carving was also present in the city and could have been a specialization. The architecture for the buildings would have needed long precise time to build because they are connected and so big. Specialization of bronze arsenic was also present at the site. There were many artifacts made out of bronze.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{studies in}} crime {{analysis}} usually use distance-decay models applied on isotropic surfaces. If the distance actually traveled {{within the context}} of a crime series can be estimated, another approach, independent of the widely discussed form of the distance decay, can be suggested. Besides, there is a need for studies on anisotropic space, especially in European cities, given their complex road network. Therefore, this study takes this aspect into account. We use data of a real case provided by the Belgian Police Department. Five criminal events have been committed in a short period of time by individuals using the same stolen car before abandoning it. The <b>milometer</b> allowed the Police to estimate the mileage covered by the criminals. The purpose of the analysis is to map out all the possible journeys to crime in order to find the offender's hideout. First, we generate cost surfaces propagated from the locations of the criminal events over the dense road network in a high-resolution raster file. This provides a distance value for all pixels of the potential paths to each crime. Then these distances are cumulated for all criminal events and the sum is confronted to the recorded mileage. This gives a restricted list of road sections from which all event locations can be reached under the constraint of the mileage covered. These results are then refined through a multi-criteria analysis using exogenous data, such as land covers. The small area finally identified contains indeed the hideout as confirmed by the Police Department. Peer reviewe...|$|E
