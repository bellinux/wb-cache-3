40|$|Ancestrulae, i. e., primary zooids evaginated from statoblasts of the {{freshwater}} bryozoan, Pectinatella gelatinosa OKA possess three buds {{of different}} size immediately after germination. In natural condition, these buds develop and grow into new zooids, thus an ancestrula forms bryozoan colony. However, in low food supply condition at laboratory culture, growth of buds was inhibited perfectly. When the ancestrula was amputated or ligated at the polypide below the lophophore, <b>main</b> <b>bud</b> developed quickly and new polypide evaginated. Therefore, it is indicated that growth of buds is inhibited by the anterior {{part of the}} polypide.

Therefore, nutrition supply from the degenerated polypide may {{play an important role}} in the development and growth of the main buds...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} seed corm {{weight on the}} growth and production of elephant foot yams (Amorphophallus paeonifolius Dennst. Nicolson) were studied. Two forms of corm with same weight were prepared, i. e., whole corm and vertically sectioned by 1 / 2. The fresh mass of each whole corm and corm section was the same. Six different corm weights were compared, i. e., 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 g. Growth and development of elephant foot yam were determined by corm weigth, large seed corm produced larger leaf and fresh mass of daughter corms. On the contrary, number of leaf decreased with increasing seed corm weight. Plants from whole seed corms emerged earlier and they were larger than those from the sectioned corms, irrespective of weight. Plants from small sized whole corm emerged earlier than the larger ones. Dissecting the <b>main</b> <b>bud</b> caused the development of lateral buds, resulted in a delay of leaf emergence. The lower yield obtained {{by the use of}} sections might be related to the late emergence leading to shorter vegetative period in the field.

40|$|Effects of GA 3 (10 - 11 - 10 - 4 M) and AMO- 1618 (10 - 6 - 10 - 4 M) on the {{development}} of generatively matured thalli of Chara vulgaris were investigated during 21 -day culture of plants in axenic conditions. It has been found that in the <b>main</b> <b>bud</b> the divisions of apical cells of the thalli are not stimulated by GA 3, whereas in the lateral buds the cell divisions are stimulated by higher GA 3 concentrations. Subsequent mitotic activity of the apical cells in the branches of the main axis is not stimulated by GA 3, whereas the lateral buds of these branches are activated. The development of rhizoids in younger nodes is accelerated by high GA 3 concentrations. The elongation of the polynuclear, internodal cells of the main axis and that of pleuridia are inhibited proportionally to the GA 3 concentration. AMO- 1618 stimulates {{the development}} of new nodes, elongation of internodes and delays the activation of lateral buds as well as the formation of rhizoids.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented is to study effects extracted from biologically active peat substances on carbohydrate accumulation processes. The study was carried out on 5 -year-old Siberian stone pine seedlings grown in the nursery forest in the southern part of the Tomsk region. These seedlings were treated with a peat preparation, which was created in Tomsk. Four groups of experimental plants were organized on the analog principle.  Each group consisted of 30 seedlings of average size and half of these seedlings were control. At the beginning of the vegetative season, a single treatment was applied to experimental plants with water solution peat preparation.  The first group of plants was treated with a 0. 1 % solution; the dose was calculated by dry substance. For the second group, the dose was increased by 25 %. For the third and fourth groups, the dose was decreased by 25 % relative to the first group. Control plants were sprayed with water. Accumulation of carbohydrates and pigments as well as growth values in the 2 -year- old needles were studied by standard methods. Glucose levels in the experimental plants existed within the limits 117 - 120 %. On the whole, simple sugar quantity did not differs between experimental variants. Glucose synthesis was accompanied by changes in quantitative values of fructose.  This, connected with glucose being a more stable compound, and compulsory conversion from glucose to labile form fructose was necessary.  The amount of fructose in the experimental seedlings had a very wide range. This process was accompanied by shoot elongation in Siberian stone pine in the first year after treatment, with the fructose amount of 14 % exceeding control values in the first and fourth group. Shoot growth was accompanied by increased fructose amount to 20 % relative to control. A similar situation was observed after winter with respect to buds. Experimental plants dominated by number of buds. After the winter quiescent period, potential <b>main</b> <b>bud</b> realized as growth of shoot. Probably, fructose was used in the growth process of shoots and in the period when buds were laid. The fructose content in the seedling needle increased when the growth rate of above-ground shoots decreased. Sucrose is a universal source for synthesis of all organic compounds; it keeps it inert, and it is important when sucrose is transported through the plant vascular systems.  Sucrose is a reserve carbohydrate. In the first variant, significant sucrose decrease compensated for increased fructose amount. Possibly, sucrose was used intensively, namely for growth processes of above-ground shoots, or at least, none of the experimental variant sucrose amounts exceeded control values. Existence of a close connection was discovered between the content of chlorophyll and the amount of carbohydrate. Maximum amount of chlorophyll 'a' was displayed in the first group (529. 32  μg/g damp weights vs. control 467. 20 μg/g).  Pigment is responsive to changes in environmental conditions, therefore it substantially determines growth and development processes of plants. It is necessary to note that pigment  amounts did not exceed the upper limit of physiological norms in all experimental groups. Changes were observed in needle length. This is connected with leaf apparatus treated plants. Opportunity was taken for extra concentrated sugars and other photosynthesis products in the needle. Thus, the natural growth regulator that the plant possessed had a prolonged effect and influence on physiological parameters of leaves such as carbohydrate accumulation. Correlation between photosynthetic pigments, carbohydrate accumulation, dynamic and growth processes was discovered. </p...|$|E

On the management of production, data on the different speed at which the tested cultivars start to flowering after planting are reported. Starting from the primordia of an accessory bud, the apical meristem became “mature” growing in the time with important differences between the cultivars, acquiring only in the second year of growth for ‘Arbequina’ and ‘Koroneiki’ (early bearing cultivars) the capability to produce principal lateral buds able to develop in the inflorescences: with ‘Frantoio’ the “aging” of two years is not enough to move the principal lateral buds to develop inflorescences: this cultivar start to flower only after four years of growth. On the management of the canopy, it is shown the different fate of buds at the same node {{at the time of its}} formation. At the base of each leaf two different types of lateral buds are present: the <b>main</b> lateral <b>bud,</b> characterized by a reproductive function, and one or more small accessory buds specialized for develop new vegetative branches reiterating the cycle. The apical meristem of new shoots (suckers) from accessory buds give rise to a new cycle of “aging” for the next production.

40|$|Groundnuts are {{subjected}} {{to a wide range}} of destructive organisms that can reduce yields. Fungal pathogens are common, and on a global scale the leaf spots, rust, and the toxin-producing Aspergillus flavus are regarded as important, and can drastically reduce yields or the quality of the crop. Other fungi are regionally or locally important. In general, viruses are restricted in distribution, but on a regional or national basis can be devastating in years when epidemics occur. Onl 1861 y one bacterial disease, caused by Pseudomonas solanacearum, is economically important. Many pests attack groundnuts, but relatively few cause consistent and serious yield losses on a worldwide basis. Aphids are, however, important globally and are vectors of several important viruses.

In this work, the apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.), a perennial plant adapted to temperate climates that displays cycles of growth and bud dormancy, was screened {{for the presence of}} DAM genes. The candidate genes retrieved were characterized in comparison to DAM genes from other species. Four of them (MdDAM 1 ? 4) are structurally very similar to the reported DAM genes. When apple genomic segments containing these candidates were compared to the peach EVERGROWING locus, a highly conserved noncoding region was detected inside their largest intron. Similar sequences were also identified inside introns of apricot and pear DAM genes. Organ expression patterns revealed that MdDAM 1 ? 4 are mainly expressed in dormant buds and seeds, with low transcript accumulation in vegetative structures. In addition, the MdDAM genes showed seasonally oscillating patterns of steady-state messenger RNA (mRNA) levels and were downregulated by artificial chilling.

Orchids are ornamental plants that stand out mainly in floriculture {{due to the}} beauty, the exoticism, the diversity of colors, the sizes and shapes of their flowers. Cattleya labiata and species of the genus Phalaenopsis feature {{a wide range of}} color choices that make their flowers much valued and demanded for marketing. Cattleya labiata is native of the Brazilian Northeast and produces purplish and slightly fragrant flowers; and Phalaenopsis sp. produces white flowers for long lasting durability. Tissue culture is widely used in massive multiplication of genres. The in vitro etiolation allows to produce large numbers of plants, reducing the risk of somaclonal variation. For this reason, this study aimed to evaluate the influence of different cultivation environments and concentrations of BAP (6 -benzylaminopurine) and NAA (naphthalene acetic acid) in vitro etiolation of the orchids Cattleya labiata and Phalaenopsis sp. Seedlings grown from seeds germinated in vitro with approximately + 1. 0 cm in length were inoculated into test tubes containing 15. 0 mL of MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of BAP (0. 0, 2. 0 and 4, 0 mg L- 1), NAA (0. 0, 1. 0 and 2. 0 mg L- 1) and culture environments (dark growth and room with artificial light) in a factorial 2 x 3 x 3 (2 environments x 3 doses of BAP x 3 doses of NAA). At the end of 150 days, the following evaluations were performed: a) number of etiolated shoots; b) number of nodes per etiolated shoot; c) length of the main sprout (cm); d) number of roots, and e) total dry mass (g). The number of etiolated shoots and nodes (per etiolated shoot) on seedlings of C. labiata and nodes per etiolated shoot in Phalaenopsis sp. were higher in the environment in the absence of light independent of the phytoregulator used, however the number of shoots of Phalaenopsis sp. the luminous environment was the most favorable.

To give context to the American dream and its origin, we have made use of professor Jim Cullen’s book “The American Dream: A Short Story of an Idea that Shaped a Nation” from 2003. We have identified what we decided to call the “the traditional dream” and “the modern dream”, both representing different outlooks on lives and ethical standards. We have done this through three specific films that we have chosen to aid us on our project. To contextualize “the traditional dream” we have chosen John Ford’s Oscar winning picture from 1940, “The Grapes of Wrath”. The movie establish the historical context in which the film take place, the Great Depression, as well as tests the faith in the American dream through the working class Joad family. The second film we have chosen, is Baz Luhrmann’s version of “The Great Gatsby” from 2013. We have used this film to establish “the modern dream”, and its effect on the characters in their pursuit of their happiness and dreams. The final film we have made use of, and the film we have put the most emphasis on, is Oliver Stone’s “Wall Street” from 1987. This film presents a moral dilemma that the <b>main</b> character, <b>Bud</b> Fox, played by Charlie Sheen, has to make. Bud Fox has to make a choice between the honourable and ethical dream represented by his father, Carl Fox, or the corrupted and greed ridden dream of Gordon Gekko. To analyse these films, we have made use of J. Emmett Winn’s book “The American Dream and Contemporary Hollywood Cinema”. The book explores the relations between film industry, classes in America, social mobility and how film plots are structured through the use of the pursuit of the American dream as an end goal for the various protagonists in film. Through our analysis we’ve reached the conclusion that the three films we have chosen all use the pursuit of the American dream as a plotline. J. Emmett Winn’s theory consists of three themes that a movie plot can be structured around. The three films we have chosen, each fit into their own separate category. However, all {{have one thing in common}} - they all serve as a lesson to the viewer. The idea of the American dream is still alive today, partly due to media and henceforth films, use of it as a goal in various film plots.

The first season, the shoot apical meristem within the bud differentiates all {{the basic elements of}} the shoot including flowering transition in lateral primordia and development of inflorescence primordia. These events practically end with bud dormancy. The second season, buds resume shoot growth associated to flower formation and development. Gene expression has been previously monitored at specific stages of bud development but has never been followed along the two growing seasons. Results Gene expression changes were analyzed along the bud annual cycle at eight different time points. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) revealed that the main factors explaining the global gene expression differences were the processes of bud dormancy and active growth as well as stress responses. Accordingly, non dormant buds showed an enrichment in functional categories typical of actively proliferating and growing cells together with the over abundance of transcripts belonging to stress response pathways. Differential expression analyses performed between consecutive time points indicated that major transcriptional changes were associated to para/endodormancy, endo/ecodormancy and ecodormancy/bud break transitions. Transcripts encoding key regulators of reproductive development were grouped in three major expression clusters corresponding to: (i) transcripts associated to flowering induction, (ii) transcripts associated to flower meristem specification and initiation and (iii) transcripts putatively involved in dormancy. Within this cluster, a MADS-box gene (VvFLC 2) and other transcripts with similar expression patterns could participate in dormancy regulation. Conclusions This work provides a global view of major transcriptional changes taking place along bud development in grapevine, highlighting those molecular and biological functions involved in the <b>main</b> events of <b>bud</b> development. As reported in other woody species, the results suggest that genes regulating flowering could also be involved in dormancy regulatory pathways in grapevine. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background In {{temperate}} regions, {{the time}} lag between vegetative bud burst and bud set determines {{the duration of}} the growing season of trees (i. e. the duration of wood biomass production). Dormancy, the period during which the plant is not growing, allows trees to avoid cold injury resulting from exposure to low temperatures. An understanding of the molecular machinery controlling the shift between these two phenological states is of key importance in the context of climatic change. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify genes upregulated during endo- and ecodormancy, the two <b>main</b> stages of <b>bud</b> dormancy. Sessile oak is a widely distributed European white oak species. A forcing test on young trees was first carried out to identify the period most likely to correspond to these two stages. Total RNA was then extracted from apical buds displaying endo- and ecodormancy. This RNA was used for the generation of cDNA libraries, and in-depth transcriptome characterization was performed with 454 FLX pyrosequencing technology. Results Pyrosequencing produced a total of 495, 915 reads. The data were cleaned, duplicated reads removed, and sequences were mapped onto the oak UniGene data. Digital gene expression analysis was performed, with both R statistics and the R-Bioconductor packages (edgeR and DESeq), on 6, 471 contigs with read numbers ≥ 5 within any contigs. The number of sequences displaying significant differences in expression level (read abundance) between endo- and ecodormancy conditions ranged from 75 to 161, depending on the algorithm used. 13 genes displaying significant differences between conditions were selected for further analysis, and 11 of these genes, including those for glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and dehydrin xero 2 (XERO 2) were validated by quantitative PCR. Conclusions The identification and functional annotation of differentially expressed genes involved in the “response to abscisic acid”, “response to cold stress” and “response to oxidative stress” categories constitutes a major step towards characterization of the molecular network underlying vegetative bud dormancy, an important life history trait of long-lived organisms...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND There is {{evidence}} that tumour-stroma interactions have {{a major role in}} the neoplastic progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Tumour budding is thought to reflect the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); however, the relationship between tumour buds and EMT remains unclear. Here we characterize the tumour-budding- and stromal cells in PDAC at protein and mRNA levels concerning factors involved in EMT. METHODS mRNA in situ hybridisation and immunostaining for E-cadherin, β-catenin, SNAIL 1, ZEB 1, ZEB 2, N-cadherin and TWIST 1 were assessed in the <b>main</b> tumour, tumour <b>buds</b> and tumour stroma on multipunch tissue microarrays from 120 well-characterised PDACs and associated with the clinicopathological features, including peritumoural (PTB) and intratumoural (ITB) budding. RESULTS Tumour-budding cells showed increased levels of ZEB 1 (P< 0. 0001) and ZEB 2 (P= 0. 0119) and reduced E-cadherin and β-catenin (P< 0. 0001, each) compared with the main tumour. Loss of membranous β-catenin in the main tumour (P= 0. 0009) and tumour buds (P= 0. 0053), without nuclear translocation, as well as increased SNAIL 1 in tumour and stromal cells (P= 0. 0002, each) correlated with high PTB. ZEB 1 overexpression in the main tumour-budding and stromal cells was associated with high ITB (P= 0. 0084; 0. 0250 and 0. 0029, respectively) and high PTB (P= 0. 0005; 0. 0392 and 0. 0007, respectively). ZEB 2 overexpression in stromal cells correlated with higher pT stage (P= 0. 03), lymphatic invasion (P= 0. 0172) and lymph node metastasis (P= 0. 0152). CONCLUSIONS In the tumour microenvironment of phenotypically aggressive PDAC, tumour-budding cells express EMT hallmarks at protein and mRNA levels underlining their EMT-type character and are surrounded by stromal cells expressing high levels of the E-cadherin repressors ZEB 1, ZEB 2 and SNAIL 1, this being strongly associated with the tumour-budding phenotype. Moreover, our findings suggest the existence of subtypes of stromal cells in PDAC with phenotypical and functional heterogeneity...|$|R
