5|$|Often in {{part because}} of the threat of hurricanes, many coastal regions had sparse {{population}} between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect.|$|E
5|$|Although Æthelred {{had been}} Eardwulf's enemy, Æthelred's killers {{proved to be}} equally hostile to Eardwulf. In 798 a dux named Wada, {{who was one of}} those who had killed King Æthelred, fought with Eardwulf on Billington Moor, near Whalley, Lancashire. Wada was put to flight and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> into exile in Mercia. He may have hoped to restore Osbald to the throne. The {{evidence}} for Osbald's continued ambition is a letter that Alcuin wrote to him, probably in 798, in which Alcuin attempted to dissuade Osbald from further interventions in Northumbrian affairs. Alcuin's arguments appear to have succeeded, since Osbald is known to have become an abbot by 799 (when his death is recorded), implying that he had given up his ambitions.|$|E
5|$|As Altrincham {{was part}} of the Bowdon parish, {{children}} from the township <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to the 16th-century school established at Bowdon; before that point, the town had no formal education system. A salt merchant from Dunham Woodhouses founded a school at Oldfield House intended for 40boys aged 8–11 from the surrounding area. Sunday schools were set up in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Altrincham's increasing population prompted the founding of more schools during the early 19th century and by 1856 the town had 9schools, 1college, and 23teachers. The introduction of compulsory education {{during the second half of}} the 19th century increased the demand for schools, and by 1886 Altrincham had 12church schools and 8private schools.|$|E

5|$|At Cranbrook, Romney helped {{manage the}} ice hockey team, {{and he joined}} the pep squad. During his senior year, he joined the cross country running team. He belonged to eleven school {{organizations}} and school clubs overall, including the Blue Key Club, a booster group that he had started. During his final year there, his academic record improved but fell short of excellence. Romney was involved in several pranks while attending Cranbrook. He has since apologized for those, stating {{that some of the}} pranks <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> too far. In March of his senior year, he began dating Ann Davies; she attended the private Kingswood School, the sister school to Cranbrook. The two became informally engaged around the time of his June 1965 graduation.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Christine {{originated}} from a tropical wave over Africa in late-August. As it neared the Atlantic Ocean, the wave spawned a tropical depression at 14.0°W, {{over the country}} of Guinea, on August25. The formation of this depression was farther east than any other tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic hurricane basin, although storms <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> undetected {{prior to the start}} of satellite imagery in the 1960s. This record would not be approached by any other storm until Hurricane Jeanne in 1998, which formed at 17.4°W. This was unlike most cyclone producing waves which travel several hundred miles over water before spawning a depression. Tracking nearly due west, the depression moved over water several hours later and bypassed the Cape Verde Islands on August 27.|$|E

As Nystrom attempts to rape Emma, Spike and Snake arrive {{just in time to}} save her. Emma manages to break free from Nystrom and rushes out of the hotel room. Snake restrains Nystrom until the police arrive to take him away.|$|E

5|$|As {{it moved}} inland, however, Alice {{produced}} prolific rains along {{and near the}} Rio Grande, resulting {{in some of the}} worst flooding ever seen in parts of northern Mexico and southern Texas; in some areas, the flooding amounted to a one-in-1,000-year event. The Pecos River crested at , which joined with the Rio Grande to produce significant flooding. The floods destroyed bridges and dikes and flooded many cities along the inner reaches of the river, which reached its highest water levels since 1865. As the river overflowed its banks, floods breached the dikes at Piedras Negras, Coahuila, destroying large sections of the town. Other communities in Mexico reported significant flood damage. In the United States, damage was heaviest in Ozona, Texas, where the floods killed 15people and caused $2million in damage (1954USD). Rainfall peaked at over , most of which fell in a 24‑hour period. In all, flooding from Hurricane Alice killed at least 55 people, including 17 in the U.S. and 38 in Mexico, though many deaths in rural Mexico <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> unreported; the total death toll could have exceeded 150.|$|E
5|$|Leofric was {{probably}} born in Cornwall, {{and his parents}} were English. Because canon law required that a bishop be 30 years old when consecrated, {{it is likely that}} Leofric was born before 1016. The medieval chronicler Florence of Worcester referred to him as a Brytonicus, which presumably meant that he was a native of Cornwall. He had a brother, Ordmaer, who acted as his steward and administered the family estates. Leofric was educated in Lotharingia, and may have been brought up abroad. Leofric <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> into exile either in 1013 when Sweyn Forkbeard, the king of Denmark invaded England or in 1016, when Sweyn's son Cnut became king of England. His education possibly took place at the church of St Stephen's in Toul, where the future Pope Leo IX was a canon from 1017 to 1024 and bishop after 1027.|$|E

Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect. Christopher Landsea et al. estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly take into account the typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Archie follows {{through on}} Regina's warning by convincing Henry that {{the fairy tale}} stories are not real, {{upsetting}} Henry. This prompts Emma to {{pay a visit to}} Archie as she figures out that Regina was responsible for threatening him. Emma accuses Regina of threatening Archie, but Regina says that Henry is missing again. Archie conjectures that Henry <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> back to the mine shaft. There, Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one Regina found earlier that he puts into his backpack. Archie goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy, but as they try to escape, an aftershock blocks off the main entrance, leaving an injured Archie and Henry trapped. They find an elevator shaft, not knowing that above ground Emma and Regina have taken the suggestion of blasting the main entrance from Marco (Tony Amendola), which results in the elevator carrying Henry and Archie being lowered even further after the blast takes place.|$|E

25|$|The grape {{clusters}} of Argentine Malbec {{are different from}} its French relatives, having smaller berries in tighter, smaller clusters. This suggests that the cuttings brought over by Pouget and later French immigrants were a unique clone that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> extinct in France due to frost and the phylloxera epidemic. Argentine Malbec wine is characterized by its deep color and intense fruity flavors with a velvety texture. While it doesn't have the tannic structure of a French Malbec, being more plush in texture, Argentine Malbecs have shown aging potential similar to their French counterparts. The Mendoza region is the leading producer of Malbec in Argentina with plantings found throughout the country {{in places such as}} La Rioja, Salta, San Juan, Catamarca and Buenos Aires.|$|E
