5000|$|Chinese {{units of}} measurement, known in Chinese as the shìzhì ("market system"), are the {{traditional}} {{units of measurement}} of the Han Chinese.

5000|$|Sometimes it is {{regarded}} as more akin to theoretical physics; some others regard computer simulation as [...] "computer experiments", yet still others consider it an intermediate or different branch between theoretical and experimental physics, a third way that supplements theory and experiment.

50|$|Solid cannonballs (“shot”) did {{not need}} a fuze, but hollow balls (“shells”) filled with something, such as {{gunpowder}} to fragment the ball hopefully on the target needed a time fuze. Early reports of shells include Venetian use at Jadra in 1376 and shells with fuzes at the 1421 siege of St Boniface in Corsica. In 1596 Sebastian Halle proposed both igniting the bursting charge by percussion and regulating the burning time of fuzes, this was considered visionary and nothing much happened until 1682. These early time fuzes used a combustible material that burnt for a time before igniting the shell filling (slow match). The problem was that precise burning times required precise time <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>recording,</b> which did not appear until 1672. Before this the proofmaster often tested the burning time of powder by reciting the Apostles' Creed for time measurement.|$|E

50|$|Quartz is {{one member}} {{of a family of}} {{crystals}} that experience the piezoelectric effect. The piezoelectric effect has found applications in high power sources, sensors, actuators, frequency standards, motors, etc., and the relationship between applied voltage and mechanical deformation is well known; this allows probing an acoustic resonance by electrical means. Applying alternating current to the quartz crystal will induce oscillations. With an alternating current between the electrodes of a properly cut crystal, a standing shear wave is generated. The Q factor, which is the ratio of frequency and bandwidth, can be as high as 106. Such a narrow resonance leads to highly stable oscillators and a high accuracy in the determination of the resonance frequency. The QCM exploits this ease and precision for sensing. Common equipment allows resolution down to 1 Hz on crystals with a fundamental resonant frequency in the 4 - 6 MHz range. A typical setup for the QCM contains water cooling tubes, the retaining unit, frequency sensing equipment through a microdot feed-through, an oscillation source, and a <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>recording</b> device.|$|E
5000|$|From 1985 onwards, Kolbe {{researched}} scale-model {{acoustic measurements}} with TDS and stage-acoustics. In 1986 and 1987, Kolbe {{contributed to the}} development of the first head-related ear-recording system for acoustic <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>recording</b> purposes. Kolbe said, [...] "Design criteria are always on the move and I have modified the LEDE concept End-Dead End studio control room technique to include the Reflection Free Zone (RFZ) manner of design. This gives the most uncolored sound possible in a given situation and provides a natural sound that can be the reference point. Of course, some of the original LEDE principles are still very valid such as the asymmetrical outer shell and completely symmetrical inner shell. The goal is to achieve as natural a sound as possible so that things such as equalization EQ can be used as an effect, rather than as an attempt to compensate for coloration and/or bad acoustics. The moment you have a neutral reference point I find that EQ settings tend to become less drastic and are often of the order of several dB or so. … As a studio designer I feel it is my duty to provide a neutral reference point; you then need a good engineer with good ears - and one who listens!” ...|$|E
5000|$|Fourth, {{there are}} {{manufacturers}} of information-processing devices that require research and sophisticated decision-making. These products {{are vital to}} information-processing activities of above mentioned industries. The products include computers of various levels and many other microelectronic devices, as well as software programs. Printing and copying machines, <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>recording</b> devices of various kinds, electronic or otherwise, are also in this category. The role of these tools are to automate certain information-processing activities. The use {{of some of these}} tools may be very simple (as in the case of some printing), and the processing done by the tools may be very simple (as in copying and some calculations) rather than intellectual and sophisticated. In other words, the specialization of these industries in an economy is neither production of information nor sophisticated decision-making. Instead, this segment serves as an infrastructure for those activities, making production of information and decision-making services will be a lot less efficient. In addition, these industries tend to be [...] "high-tech" [...] or research intensive - trying to find more efficient ways to boost efficiency of information production and sophisticated decision-making. For example, the function of a standard calculator is quite simple and it is easy to how to use it. However, manufacturing a well-functioning standard calculator takes a lot of processes, far more than the task of calculation performed by the users.|$|E
