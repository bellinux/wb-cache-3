5|$|Chronic Chagas disease {{remains a}} <b>major</b> <b>health</b> problem in many Latin American countries, despite the {{effectiveness}} of hygienic and preventive measures, such as eliminating the transmitting insects. However, several landmarks have been achieved {{in the fight against}} it in Latin America, including a reduction by 72% of the incidence of human infection in children and young adults in the countries of the Southern Cone Initiative, and at least three countries (Uruguay, in 1997, and Chile, in 1999, and Brazil in 2006) have been certified free of vectorial and transfusional transmission. In Argentina, vectorial transmission has been interrupted in 13 of the 19 endemic provinces, and major progress toward this goal has also been made in both Paraguay and Bolivia.|$|E

The town has seven health centres, including a health complex in Malvern Link and a group practice on Pickersleigh Road.

5|$|The Russian Spaniel {{is a type}} of spaniel first {{standardised}} in 1951 in the Soviet Union after World War II by cross breeding English Cocker Spaniels, English Springer Spaniels {{and other}} spaniel breeds. Physically it is similar to a Cocker Spaniel, but has a shorter, tighter coat and a longer body. Developed and used as hunting dogs, this breed does not suffer from any <b>major</b> <b>health</b> complaints other than those normally associated with spaniels. Popular in its native Russia, the breed was only introduced overseas in the 1990s, and is not yet recognised by any major kennel clubs.|$|E
5|$|The {{health service}} {{centers in the}} upazila include a health complex, an {{infectious}} diseases hospital, a railway TB hospital, 11 family planning centres and a veterinary treatment centre. Bangladesh Railway set up the hospital at Kumira in 1952 with a capacity of 150 beds. The capacity was reduced to 50 beds in 1994 as some focus was redirected to the Railway Hospital at Central Railway Building in Chittagong. Originally built to treat railway employees, the hospital now also treats people from the wider community. Malaria, dengue and other fevers, hepatitis, as well as respiratory infections including tuberculosis {{are some of the}} <b>major</b> <b>health</b> threats. The percentage of disabled in Sitakunda is reported to be the highest in Bangladesh, at 17% compared to the national average of 13%.|$|E
5|$|New {{environmental}} technologies in heating, lighting, ventilation and sanitation were also critical to creating taller buildings that were attractive to work in. Central heating {{could not be}} easily extended to serve larger buildings; in the 1850s, a system using low-pressure steam and steam-operated fans became adopted {{in the construction of}} the later skyscrapers. Many U.S. buildings were lit by gas, but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in taller buildings. As an alternative, electric lights were installed from 1878 onwards, powered by basement generators. Ventilation was also a challenge, as smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the gas lighting made air quality a <b>major</b> <b>health</b> issue. A steam-driven, forced-draft ventilation system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in taller buildings by the 1870s, overcoming much of the problem. Improvements in iron piping permitted running hot and cold water and sanitation facilities to be installed throughout taller buildings for the first time.|$|E

5|$|The Picardy Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{developed}} in France {{for use as}} a gundog. It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds. It is thought {{to be one of the}} two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain. However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century. Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no <b>major</b> <b>health</b> issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears, it can be prone to ear infections.|$|E
