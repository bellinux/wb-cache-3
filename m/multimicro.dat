40|$|Load flow {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} called routines in the planning, operation, as well as in the security control of a power system. For the traditional offline single-case solution, algorithmic speed has ceased to be relevant. But such speed is vital for applications in security assessment and real-time applications of system control. The authors present the parallelization of the load flow calculation using a fast decoupled method. The major challenge to this is the parallelization of linearized sets of equations which is the most time-consuming part of the computation. Parallel algorithms have been developed employing different solution techniques and have been run on the <b>MULTIMICRO</b> which is a parallel machine developed in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Results obtained for a 198 bus system are presente...|$|E
40|$|Teaching/learning {{microcontrollers}} in {{the laboratory}} has been traditionally carried out using general purpose simulators and/or evaluation boards. In-circuit emulators are not widely used because their high cost. This paper presents UVI 51, a software tool developed for teaching/learning the 8051 microcontroller {{in the laboratory}} and/or the classroom. UVI 51 includes an assembler, a <b>multimicro</b> simulator, a logic analyzer, and an assistant. The tool allows to simulate systems consisting of up to 4 microcontrollers plus a set of external peripherals. Both the CPU core and the embedded peripherals of each microcontroller are simulated. Everything in UVI 51 has been designed with the educational perspective in mind. A set of windows depict the configuration and behaviour of every embedded peripheral. UVI 51 is currently being used in several courses on microcontrolllers at University of Vigo (Spain) and also at the college level. The tool is suitable for learning nearly everything about the 8051, ranging from the CPU and instruction set basics to complex use of timers, interrupts and the serial port. This paper shows the benefits of using UVI 51 {{as an alternative to}} traditional instruction tools...|$|E
