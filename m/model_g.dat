Design work started in 2003 and continued into 2004, when Hideo Komuro's design was chosen for the sedan. The coupe design process was later completed {{in the first half}} of 2005, with a conceptual variant being readied for public introduction. The redesigned Infiniti G sedan and coupe were introduced for the 2007 and 2008 model years, respectively. The fourth generation G sedan was launched in September 2006 as a 2007 model with a heavily revised 3.5L VQ35HR engine and a 5-speed automatic as the standard transmission, a 6-speed manual was also available. The redesigned second generation G coupe launched in June 2007 as a 2008 model with a larger 3.7L VQ37VHR, the first Infiniti engine to feature VVEL. It too came with either a 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual. All manual G models include a sport package. The 2009 G37 convertible was launched in June 2009. The 2009 <b>model</b> <b>G</b> sedan followed suit using the same VQ37VHR engine. Also for 2009 the 5-speed automatic was replaced with an all-new 7-speed and both the sedan and coupe gained a self-healing paint finish from the Infiniti EX. The V36 platform continued for 2010 with numerous interior changes and upgrades as well as a mid-product cycle exterior update for the sedan. In late 2010 the Infiniti G25 went on sale as a 2011 model, featuring a smaller 2.5L version of the VQVHR engine to allow the G to better compete with the Lexus IS250 and BMW 328i.|$|E

40|$|A {{category}} of item response models is presented with two defining features: they all (i) have a tree representation, and (ii) {{are members of}} the family of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). Because the models are based on trees, they are denoted as IRTree models. The GLMM nature of the models implies that they can all be estimated with the glmer function of the lme 4 package in R. The aim of the article is to present four subcategories of models, the first two of which are based on a tree representation for response categories: 1. linear response tree <b>models</b> (e. <b>g.,</b> missing response <b>models),</b> 2. nested response tree <b>models</b> (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>models</b> for parallel observations regarding item responses such as agreement and certainty), while the last two are based on a tree representation for latent variables: 3. linear latent-variable tree <b>models</b> (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>models</b> for change processes), and 4. nested latent-variable tree <b>models</b> (e. <b>g.,</b> bi-factor <b>models).</b> The use of the glmer function is illustrated for all four subcategories.

40|$|Background: Genomic {{prediction}} of purebred animals for crossbred performance can {{be based on}} a model that estimates effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in purebreds on crossbred performance. For crossbred performance, SNP effects might be breed-specific due to differences between breeds in allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium patterns between SNPs and quantitative trait loci. Accurately tracing the breed-of-origin of alleles (BOA) in three-way crosses is possible with a recently developed procedure called BOA. A model that accounts for breed-specific SNP effects (BOA model), has never been tested empirically on a three-way crossbreeding scheme. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the estimates of variance components and the predictive accuracy of the BOA model compared to models in which SNP effects for crossbred performance were assumed to be the same across breeds, using either breed-specific allele frequencies (<b>G</b> A <b>model)</b> or allele frequencies averaged across breeds (<b>G</b> B <b>model).</b> In this study, we used data from purebred and three-way crossbred pigs on average daily gain (ADG), back fat thickness (BF), and loin depth (LD). Results: Estimates of variance components for crossbred performance from the BOA model were mostly similar to estimates from <b>models</b> <b>G</b> A and G B. Heritabilities for crossbred performance ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 46 between traits. Genetic correlations between purebred and crossbred performance r pc) across breeds ranged from 0. 30 to 0. 62 for ADG and from 0. 53 to 0. 74 for BF and LD. For ADG, prediction accuracies of the BOA model were higher than those of the G A and <b>G</b> B <b>models,</b> with significantly higher accuracies only for one maternal breed. For BF and LD, prediction accuracies of <b>models</b> <b>G</b> A and G B were higher than those of the BOA model, with no significant differences. Across all traits, <b>models</b> <b>G</b> A and G B yielded similar predictions. Conclusions: The BOA model yielded a higher prediction accuracy for ADG in one maternal breed, which had the lowest r pc (0. 30). Using the BOA model was especially relevant for traits with a low r pc. In all other cases, the use of crossbred information in <b>models</b> <b>G</b> A and G B, does not jeopardize predictions and these models are more easily implemented than the BOA model. </p...|$|R
