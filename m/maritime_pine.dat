5|$|Amanita gemmata is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{meaning it}} forms a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of compatible host plants. Through the association, the plant provides the fungus with a carbon source, and the fungus provides the plant with several benefits such as nutrients and protection from pathogens. Largent and collaborators (1980) document mycorrhizal associations of A.gemmata with Manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) and Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta), and Nieto and Carbone with <b>Maritime</b> <b>Pine</b> (Pinus pinaster) in Spain. The fungus favours sandy and slightly acidic soils, and is often found in association with Norway Spruce (Picea abies). The mushroom grows either singly, scattered, or in groups in coniferous and mixed forests, especially along paths and roads.|$|E
5|$|The Swan Coastal Plain {{north of}} Perth {{has become an}} {{important}} feeding area. There, cockatoos also forage in the Gnangara pine plantations, where they feed on the seeds of Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and <b>maritime</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus pinaster). Carnaby's black cockatoos have come to depend on these plantations since the early 20th century. Almost two-thirds of the Carnaby's black cockatoos in the Perth–Peel Coastal Plain roost in the Gnangara-Pinjar pine plantation. Other non-native plants that the birds also consume include Erodium species, doublegee (Emex australis) seeds, {{the fruit of the}} umbrella tree (Schefflera actinophylla), seeds of liquidambar (Liquidambar styraciflua), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), almond (Prunus amygdalus), onion grass (Romulea rosea), white cedar (Melia azedarach), and hibiscus flowers.|$|E
25|$|The <b>maritime</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus pinaster) {{is found}} at an {{intermediate}} altitude and on generally siliceous soil, which in Galicia {{goes down to}} sea level and inland alternates with Pyrenean oak. Over limestone, the black pine (Pinus nigra subsp salzmannii) {{plays an important role}} in many of the mountain ranges in the centre, east and south of the Peninsula; in limy soil, and at the same altitude, it usually displaces the former. Both are displaced at higher altitudes by the Scots pine.|$|E

25|$|Of all the oaks, the Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) is {{the most}} {{resistant}} to drought and the continental-style climate. These forests, of a sub-Atlantic character, often represent the shift from Mediterranean vegetation to Atlantic vegetation. They cover a wide area of the peninsula and are of great importance, above all on the mountain ranges in {{the centre of the}} peninsula; from the interior of Galicia and extending south of the Cordillera Cantábrica they extend throughout the Sistema Central, reaching, to the south, (though scarce by the time they reach this region) the Sierra Nevada and Cádiz. They usually extend from some 700 to 800 metres to some 1500 to 1600 m in altitude. They prefer siliceous soil and, as altitude increases, they replace the damp oak forests and cork oak; on the high ground they give way to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests or to los piornales serranos with creeping juniper. In areas where the influence of the Atlantic is more evident, they are taken over by heather and Erica australis; in the remainder, in clearings and in more degraded phases, rock rose (Cistaceae) mixed with laurel leaf and Spanish lavender (Lavandula stoechas) is more frequent. Their natural range is usually covered by forests of Scots pine or <b>maritime</b> <b>pine.</b>|$|E
500|$|Reflecting {{their close}} {{relationships}} with trees, the fruit bodies of L. indigo are typically found {{growing on the}} ground, scattered or in groups, in both deciduous and coniferous forests. They are also commonly found in floodplain areas that have been recently submerged. In Mexico, associations have been noted with Mexican alder, American Hornbeam, American Hophornbeam, and Liquidambar macrophylla, while in Guatemala the mushroom associates with smooth-bark Mexican pine and other pine and oak species. In Costa Rica, the species forms associations with several native oaks of the Quercus genus. Under controlled laboratory conditions, L.indigo was shown {{to be able to}} form ectomycorrhizal associations with the neotropical pine species Mexican white pine, Hartweg's pine, Mexican yellow pine, smooth-bark Mexican pine, and [...] the Eurasian pines Aleppo pine, European black pine, <b>maritime</b> <b>pine,</b> and Scots pine.|$|E

(3) Genetically the Corsican population is the most distant from all others. It has been suggested that this population originated recently through human interventi-on, being the Liguria region of Italy and the East of Spain its most likely origins (BAHRMAN et al., 1994). Our results are com-patible with this hypothesis and suggest that the Corsican population arose from a few founders, remaining ever since genetically isolated. The uniqueness of this population within the Mediterranean group has also been reported by BARADAT and MARPEAU (1988), and it was already mentioned in the clas-sic work of DUFF (1928).
