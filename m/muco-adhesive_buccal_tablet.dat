Methods: A 4 -year budget impact model was developed for the period 2012 – 2015 for patients with BTcP from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System. BTcP products included in this model were rapid-onset opioids containing fentanyl (buccal, sublingual, or nasal transmucosal). Prevalence data on cancer, BTcP, opioid use, and number of BTcP episodes were obtained from the literature. Input data on health care resources associated with opioid use and opioid-induced side effects were obtained by consulting experts in oncology from different Spanish hospitals. Resources used included drugs, medical and emergency visits, other nonpharmacologic treatments, and treatment of opioid-induced side effects. Unit costs were obtained from the literature, and a 3 % discount rate was applied to costs. Based on the unit costs for drugs and health care resources, the annual BTcP treatment costs per patient associated with each fentanyl product were determined to estimate the overall budget impact based on the total treatment population and the percentage of drug utilization associated with each product. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model. Results: Patients treated with oral opioids for BTcP were estimated at 23, 291 in 2012, with an increase up to 23, 413 in 2015. The average annual budget savings, with an increase of fentanyl <b>buccal</b> <b>tablets,</b> fentanyl sublingual tablets, and intranasal fentanyl spray, and a decrease in oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, was estimated at € 2. 6 million, which represents a 0. 5 % decrease in the total costs of BTcP over the next 4 years. Results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the model was most sensitive to drug cost per day for the fentanyl <b>buccal</b> <b>tablet.</b> A 50 % decrease in the daily cost of the fentanyl <b>buccal</b> <b>tablet</b> resulted in the largest overall decrease in budget impact of € 5. 4 million. Conclusion: The increase in use of the fentanyl <b>buccal</b> <b>tablet</b> leads to overall savings in the budget impact for the Spanish National Health System. Although the economic impact of treatment for BTcP was shown to increase over 4 years due to population growth, the average annual cost per patient was reduced by € 29 with increased use of the fentanyl <b>buccal</b> <b>tablet.</b> Keywords: cancer, breakthrough pain, economic analysis, costs, rapid onset opioid...|$|R

Direct compression method was used for the preparation of <b>buccal</b> <b>tablets,</b> and screening studies were conducted with different polymers to determine their effects on tablet characteristics. Carbopol® (CP) and sodium alginate (SA) were selected as two polymer types for further optimization studies by applying response surface methodology. Tablet hardness (TH), ex vivo residence time (RT), and peak detachment force (DF) from buccal mucosa were selected as three important responses. Physicochemical compatibility of formulation excipients and RIS was evaluated by using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. In vitro drug release profiles and release kinetics were investigated; swelling index and matrix erosion studies were conducted. Optimum formulation consisted of 16. 4 % CP and 20. 3 % SA, which provided 7. 67 ± 0. 29 hour ex vivo RT, 45. 52 ± 4. 85 N TH, and 2. 12 ± 0. 17 N DF. FT-IR spectroscopy and DSC analysis revealed that there was no chemical interaction present between tablet ingredients. Cumulative RIS release of > 90 % was achieved after 8 hours of in vitro dissolution studies, which was supported by swelling and matrix erosion analysis. Mechanism of RIS release was fitted best to zero-order model, while release exponent (n) value of 0. 77 demonstrated an anomalous (non-Fickian) release, indicating combined erosion and swelling mechanism. The results suggested that optimized <b>buccal</b> <b>tablets</b> of RIS would be a promising and alternative delivery system for the treatment of schizophrenia.

METHODS: A multicenter, open and randomized self-crossover control trial was carried out with all the eligible patients randomized into AB or BA group. Patients in AB group were given nausea 0. 1 mg as <b>buccal</b> <b>tablet</b> one hour before chemotherapy in the first cycle and kytril tablet 2 mg in the second cycle, those in BA group were given these drugs in the reverse order. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were allotted to this study, including 44 patients in DDP-arm and 29 in ADM-arm. Sixty-two patients were evaluable for response and 70 patients for safety. Nausea DBT was as effective as kytril tablet in the control of anorexia, nausea and vomiting during the first 24 hours after chemotherapy, with response rates of 74. 2 %, 77. 4 %, 83. 9 % in nausea DBT and 74. 2 %, 71. 0 %, 88. 7 % DBT in kytril tablets. A high efficacy in the control of vommitting induced by cisplatin was observed in both nausea DBT and kytril tablets. The complete control rates and overall control rates were 83. 3 %, 91. 7 % in nausea DBT and 86. 1 %, 97. 2 % in kytril tablets, respectively. The side effects of nausea DBT were head heaviness, dry mouth and somnolence, which were mild and comparable with kytril in their frequencies. CONCLUSION: Nausea disintegrating <b>buccal</b> <b>tablet</b> is able to effectively prevent gastrointestinal reaction induced by anticancer drugs, with efficacy and side effects similar to kytril tablets.

40|$|The oral {{delivery}} of drugs has several disadvantages, particularly in pediatrics, geriatrics and other patients experiencing difficulty in swallowing tablets or capsules. A frequent {{approach to this}} problem {{is the use of}} liquid formulations or buccal drug delivery systems. However, with liquid formulations, many drugs have an undesirable solubility or stability in appropriate solvents and dosing accuracy is compromised due to the patient being required to measure doses. Current rapidly disintegrating buccal drug delivery systems, such as <b>buccal</b> <b>tablets,</b> are able to dissolve rapidly within the oral cavity; however the short residence time at the absorption surface is a limiting factor in the effectiveness of these delivery systems. Furthermore, <b>buccal</b> <b>tablet</b> and wafer systems tend to be brittle and fragile and hence require special protective packaging. A rapidly disintegrating, flexible, mucoadhesive fibrous matrix system (FMS) with drug-loaded electrospun fibers incorporated onto a polymeric backing film may be capable of overcoming some of the innate disadvantages of the non-invasive delivery of various drugs, especially those requiring a rapid onset of action. Various electrospinnable polymers were investigated for suitability {{in the development of the}} electrospun fibrous layer of the FMS, and it was determined that polyvinylalcohol (PVA) produced drug-loaded fibers with the most acceptable morphology and a desirable disintegration time. An ideal drug-loaded fiber formulation was obtained by design of experiments and employed in further investigations. The original model drug, zidovudine (AZT), exhibited less than 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study mucoadhesive bilayer <b>buccal</b> <b>tablets</b> of propranolol hydrochloride using the bioadhesive polymers sodium alginate (Na-alginate) and Carbopol 934 P (CP) along with ethyl cellulose as an impermeable backing layer. The tablets were evaluated for weight variation, thickness, hardness, friability, surface pH, mucoadhesive strength, swelling index, in vitro drug release, ex vivo drug permeation, ex vivo mucoadhesion, and in vivo pharmacodynamics in rabbits. Tablets containing Na-alginate and CP in the ratio of 5 ∶ 1 (F 2) had the maximum percentage of in vitro drug release without disinte-gration in 12 hours. The swelling index was proportional to Na-alginate content and inversely proportional to CP content. The surface pH of all tablets was found to be satis-factory (7. 0 ± 1. 5), close to neutral pH; hence, buccal cavity irritation should not occur with these tablets. The mechanism of drug release was found to be non-Fickian diffusion and followed zero-order kinetics. The formulation F 4 was optimized based on good biodhesive strength (28. 9 ± 0. 99 g) and sustained in vitro drug permeation (68. 65 %± 3. 69 % for 12 hours). The behavior of formulation F 4 was examined in human saliva, and both the drug and the <b>buccal</b> <b>tablet</b> were found to be stable. The formulation F 4 was applied to rabbit oral mucosa for in vivo studies. The formulation inhibited isoprenaline-induced tachycardia. The studies conducted in rabbits confirmed the sustained release as compared with intravenous administration...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to develop <b>buccal</b> adhesive <b>tablets</b> of Simvastatin using mucoadhesive polymers. Simvastatin has short biological half-life (3 hr), high first-pass metabolism and poor oral bioavailability (5 %), hence an ideal candidate for buccal delivery system. The tablets were prepared by direct compression technique using xanthan gum, guar gum, chitosan and aloe gum. Aloe gum was extracted from Aloe Barbadensis miller leaves. Formulations were evaluated for weight variation, hardness, friability, drug content, swelling studies, determination of mucoadhesive strength and in vitro release studies. FTIR studies show no evidence on interaction between drug, polymers and other excipients. In vitro drug release studies revealed that release of Simvastatin from different formulations varies with characteristics and composition of polymers. Formulation F 3 selected as optimized formulation based on physicochemical parameters, and in vitro release rates and follows zero order drug release. Chitosan and guar gum were helpful for controlling the drug release in better way when used in proper combinations. The results indicate that suitable bioadhesive <b>buccal</b> <b>tablets</b> for Simvastatin with controlled drug delivery could be prepared...|$|R
40|$|Mucoadhesive <b>buccal</b> <b>tablets</b> of {{metoprolol}} tartarate were fabricated with {{objective of}} avoiding first pass metabolism and prolonging duration of action. The mucoadhesive polymers used in formulation were Carbopol- 934, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose and sodium carboxymethylcellulose. The formulations were characterized for physiochemical parameters, in vitro release studies and in vivo placebo studies. The best mucoadhesive performance and in vitro drug release profile were {{exhibited by the}} tablets containing hydroxyethylcellulose and Carbopol- 934 in ratio 1 : 2. This product was more comfortable to the user due to absence of erosion, faster hydration rate and less viscosity of surrounding environment. In vivo placebo studies did not show any side effects...|$|R
