40|$|We {{report a}} rare case of {{bilateral}} metachronous bronchial typical carcinoid tumor surgically treated. At {{the age of}} 33 years, the patient underwent, in another hospital, a left upper lobectomy for a typical carcinoid tumor. After 4 years, the patient manifested the symptoms of a new central typical carcinoid tumor located at {{the origin of the}} middle lobe bronchus and infiltrating the intermedius one. This tumor was first treated by laser therapy, but long-term follow-up evaluation with bronchoscopy revealed a local recurrence of disease. So we performed a <b>middle</b> <b>sleeve</b> lobectomy with radical node dissection...|$|E
40|$|Lung {{resection}} is {{the standard}} therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer confined to the lung. The extent of pulmonary resection is dictated by the location and extent of the tumor and the patient’s physiologic ability to tolerate resection. We present {{the case of a}} patient who had a large non-small-cell tumor of the lung that involved the right main stem bronchus and the adjacent pulmonary artery; poor pulmonary function precluded a pneumonectomy. Right upper and <b>middle</b> <b>sleeve</b> bilobectomy resection was per-formed, but reconstruction was not possible due to tethering by the intact lower lobe vein. Therefore, the remaining lower lobe was removed, and the lower lobe vein was di-vided and reimplanted into the upper lobe pulmonary venous stump. Cephalad ad-vancement and autotransplantation of the lower lobe were then accomplished. These procedures allowed enough mobilization for direct bronchial and arterial reconstruction.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for treatment of nonstump postlobectomy bronchial fistula. Our patient had right lower lobectomy for T 3 N 2 M 0 adenocarcinoma. An increased air leak developed 8 days later, and bronchoscopy revealed {{the presence of a}} bronchial fistula. On reexploration, the bronchial stump was intact, and the membranous part of the bronchus intermedius was sloughed up to the opening of the upper lobe bronchus. A <b>middle</b> lobectomy with <b>sleeve</b> resection of the bronchus intermedius and part of the right main bronchus was performed, and the upper lobe was reanastomosed to the right main bronchus.

40|$|When a lung tumor {{arises in}} segment 6, the close {{anatomical}} {{relationship to the}} middle lobe bronchus may make a lower bilobectomy necessary. Sleeve lobectomy may be an alternative. These procedures were compared retrospectively in 36 patients operated on between January 2005 and December 2006 with non-small-cell lung cancer (stage I-IIIB) of the right lower lobe. Sleeve lobectomy was performed in 21 patients and bilobectomy in 15 (41 %). Preoperative lung function was comparable in both groups. Radical resection was achieved in 34 / 36 patients. Operation time was 121 min for sleeve lobectomy and 144 min for bilobectomy. Chest tubes were removed after 5 days in both groups. Postoperative lung function was better after sleeve lobectomy than bilobectomy (forced expiratory volume in 1 st sec: 78 % vs. 69 %). Preservation of the <b>middle</b> lobe by <b>sleeve</b> lobectomy is feasible. There {{was no evidence that}} this resection was less radical, and complication rates were similar in both groups...|$|R
50|$|The {{characters}} {{have also been}} re-designed to look like animated versions of how they appeared in the live-action Scooby-Doo film. For instance, Scooby is drawn with dot eyes. Thus, it is the third show in the Scooby-Doo series, after A Pup Named Scooby-Doo and What's New, Scooby-Doo?, that is not animated or drawn in the usual Hanna-Barbera style. This is also the first series in which Casey Kasem does not voice Shaggy, but is instead done by Scott Menville, although Scott Innes or Billy West portrayed the character {{in many of the}} Scooby-Doo animated movies made for television or home video. However, in this series, Kasem does voice Shaggy's rich and on-the-run Uncle Albert. Another noticeable difference is that Shaggy now wears a white short-sleeved shirt with a green strip across the <b>middle</b> and green <b>sleeves</b> instead of his trademark green T-shirt. Frank Welker still does Scooby's voice. In addition, Shaggy and Scooby's cowardice tendencies have been considerably toned down.|$|R

He {{was dressed in}} a pea-jacket, which evidently did not belong to him, for it hardly reached his <b>middle,</b> and the <b>sleeves</b> were so short that his forearms were half bare, showing that he wore nothing beneath this {{borrowed}} garment. Below it he had on white knee-breeches, with green stains of bruised grass on them. The breeches were made with a broad ilap in front, under which, and passing round his waist, was a scarf of crimson silk. From his knees to his socks, the edges of which had fallen over his laced boots, his legs were visible, naked, and muscular. On his face was a mask of sweat, dust, and blood, partly rubbed away in places by a sponge, the borders of its passage marked by black streaks. Underneath his left eye was a mound of bluish flesh nearly as large as a walnut. The jaw below it, and the opposite cheek, were severely bruised, and his lip was cut through at one corner. He had no hat; his close-cropped hair was disordered, and his ears were as though they had been rubbed with coarse sand-paper.|$|R

The patient showed rapid restoration of normal platelet count and complete remission of ITP after lung resection. A 58 -year-old man with an abnormal lung shadow on the right hilum was referred to our center. Computed tomography (CT) on referral revealed a mass in the right intermediate bronchus with intrapulmonary lymph node enlargement (Fig 1). Bronchoscopy revealed a polyp protruding from the right intermediate bronchus. Histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen showed pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma. The clinical stage of the patient was judged to be T 2 bN 1 M 0 Stage II B.

40|$|In a {{group of}} 27 {{patients}} with early hilar lung cancer, standard sleeve lobectomy was performed in 14 cases, standard lobectomy in 9 cases, and another 4 patients underwent parenchymal-sparing operations (2 had sleeve segmentectomy, 1 had <b>sleeve</b> <b>middle</b> lobectomy, and 1 had left second carinal resection). The changes of conventional pulmonary function tests and regional pulmonary function were compared between patients undergoing sleeve lobectomy and those undergoing parenchymal-sparing surgery. The parameters used for the conventional lung function tests were FVC, %FVC, FEV 1. 0, and %FEV 1. 0. For the evaluation of regional pulmonary function, perfusion scans using 99 mTc-MAA and ventilation scans using 133 Xe were performed. The decrease of FVC in the sleeve lobectomy group (n = 5) was 724 +/- 182. 7 ml, whereas that in the parenchymal- sparing surgery group (n = 4) was 367. 5 +/- 52. 1 ml, a significant difference. Both the FEV 1. 0 and %FEV 1. 0 showed no marked changes in both groups between the preoperative and postoperative values. Perfusion and ventilation scans in the parenchymal-sparing group showed a superior result in comparison with sleeve lobectomy group. All the patients undergoing parenchymal-sparing operations survived over the long term. It was thus concluded that parenchymal-sparing surgery {{can be applied to}} carefully selected patients with tiny localized cancers...|$|R
40|$|Objective. We {{conducted}} a clinicopathologic study of surgically treated cases of tracheobronchial adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). Materials and Methods. Of the 1, 909 patients with lung cancer who underwent resection in our hospital and associated institutes during the 28 -year period between 1980 and 2007, five (0. 3 %) were pathologically diagnosed as ACC of the trachea, bronchus and lung. All 5 patients were women aged from 37 to 67 years, {{with an average}} age of 50. 8 years. Four tumors were located in the larger airways (one in the carina, one in the right main bronchus, one in the left main bronchus, one in the middle lobe bronchus) and one tumor was located in the peripheral lung of left S^ 4 _b. The following operations were done: bronchoplastic procedures in 3 (carinal resection with double-barreled carinoplasty in 1, sleeve right pneumonectomy in 1, <b>sleeve</b> <b>middle</b> lobectomy in 1), left pneumonectomy in 1, and left upper lobectomy in 1. Results. Three of 5 patients have survived for 172, 144, and 10 months after surgery, respectively, but 2 of the patients died 15 and 95 months after surgery, respectively (The cause of death of one patient was distant metastases to the skin, breast, and lung, and that of the other patient was colon cancer). Conclusion. For local treatment for ACC of the major airway, the best method is considered to be sleeve resection of the trachea or bronchus in an area where airway reconstruction may not be disturbed and to add postoperative irradiation when there is residual carcinoma at the stump. However, it seems controversial to recommend adjuvant radiotherapy in all patients undergoing resection. 目的. 気管・気管支原発の腺様嚢胞癌(ACC) 手術症例につき検討した. 対象と方法. 切除標本でACCと病理診断された 5 例を対象とした. 年齢は 37 〜 67 (平均 50. 8) 歳,全例女性であった. 発生部位は中枢: 4,末梢: 1 例であった. リンパ節転移はN 2 : 1,N 1 : 1,N 0 : 3 例で,病理病期はIA: 1,IIB: 2,IIIB: 2 例であった. 術式は肺全摘: 2,葉切: 2,気管分岐部切除: 1 例で,気管・気管支形成術を 3 例に施行した. 結果. N 2 例は袖状右肺全摘術後 15 ヶ月で遠隔転移により死亡した. N 1 例は袖状右中葉切除術後 9 年 6 ヶ月で局所再発し,残存右肺全摘術を施行,さらに 4 年 10 ヶ月健在である. N 0 例 3 例のうち末梢発生の 1 例は左上葉切除術後 7 年 11 ヶ月で他病死した. 他のN 0 例は切除断端陽性例で, 1 例は気管分岐部切除・二連銃型再建術後に放射線療法を施行し 12 年健在,もう 1 例は左肺全摘術後に放射線療法を施行し 10 ヶ月健在である. 結論. ACCは一般的にはslow growingであり,転移することはまれだが気管支壁に沿って進展するために根治切除が困難な症例も少なくない. 手術では気管・気管支形成術が必要とされる症例も多い. 断端陰性例に対する術後放射線療法については未だcontroversialな問題である...|$|R
6000|$|They had {{pictures}} {{hung on the}} walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and {{one called}} [...] "Signing the Declaration." [...] There was some that they called crayons, {{which one of the}} daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see before --blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the <b>middle</b> of the <b>sleeves,</b> and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said [...] "Shall I Never See Thee More Alas." [...] Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said [...] "I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas." [...] There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said [...] "And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas." [...] These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.|$|R
