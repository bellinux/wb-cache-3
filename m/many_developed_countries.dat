25|$|Seen as {{a relief}} {{to the problem of}} {{overpopulation}} even as early as 1758, and listed as one of Stephen Hawking's reasons for pursuing space exploration, it has become apparent that space colonisation in response to overpopulation is unwarranted. Indeed, the birth rates of <b>many</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries,</b> specifically spacefaring ones, are at or below replacement rates, thus negating the need to use colonisation as a means of population control.|$|E
25|$|In Syria in 2010, 22.5% {{of women}} were unemployed. This figure has {{probably}} increased significantly {{due to the}} Syrian civil war.

Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Iran all have female unemployment rates ranging from 15% to 17%. Female unemployment in Iran may be exacerbated by the collateral effects US, UN, and European sanctions.

25|$|In <b>many</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries,</b> {{electronic}} waste processing usually first involves {{dismantling the}} equipment into various parts (metal frames, power supplies, circuit boards, plastics), often by hand, but increasingly by automated shredding equipment. A typical {{example is the}} NADIN electronic waste processing plant in Novi Iskar, Bulgaria—the largest facility {{of its kind in}} Eastern Europe. The advantages of this process are the human's ability to recognize and save working and repairable parts, including chips, transistors, RAM, etc. The disadvantage is that the labor is cheapest in countries with the lowest health and safety standards.|$|E

A few countries on any continent are desktop-minority; European countries (and some in South America, and a few, e.g. Haiti, in North America; and most in Asia and Africa) are smartphone-majority, Poland and Turkey highest with 57.68% and 62.33%, respectively. In Ireland, smartphone use at 45.55% outnumbers desktop use and mobile as a whole gains majority when including the tablet share at 9.12%. Spain is also slightly desktop-minority.|$|E
25|$|Religious {{adherence}} in Burnside {{is higher}} than the Adelaide and Australian average, standing at 71.7%. Of this adherence, 67.6% represents traditional Christian denominations. Common across Australia and <b>many</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries,</b> there has been a substantial decline in religiosity; this is evident but less marked in Burnside; 17.7% of residents profess no religious belief (atheism, agnosticism, etc.). The ten strongest religions/denominations in decreasing order are: Catholic, Anglican, Uniting, Orthodox, Lutheran, Baptist, Buddhism, Presbyterian, Judaism and Hinduism. Catholicism is unique for its marked increase (575 persons) in believers between 1996 and 2001, most other religions' numbers remained stable or saw a slight decrease.|$|E

25|$|Radar {{estimates}} of rainfall and general weather forecasting techniques {{are also important}} components of good flood forecasting. In areas where good quality data is available, the intensity and height of a flood can be predicted with fairly good accuracy and plenty of lead time. The output of a flood forecast is typically a maximum expected water level and the likely time of its arrival at key locations along a waterway, and it also may allow for the computation of the likely statistical return period of a flood. In <b>many</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries,</b> urban areas at risk of flooding are protected against a 100-year flood – that is a flood that has a probability of around 63% of occurring in any 100-year period of time.|$|E
25|$|Voluntary {{return of}} {{refugees}} into {{their country of}} origin, in safety and dignity, is based on their free will and their informed decision. In {{the last couple of}} years parts of or even whole refugee populations were able to return to their home countries: e.g. 120,000 Congolese refugees returned from the Republic of Congo to the DRC, 30,000 Angolans returned home from the DRC and Botswana, Ivorian refugees returned from Liberia, Afghans from Pakistan, and Iraqis from Syria. In 2013, the governments of Kenya and Somalia also signed a tripartite agreement facilitating the repatriation of refugees from Somalia. The UNHCR and the IOM offer assistance to refugees who want to return voluntarily to their home countries. <b>Many</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> also have Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) programmes for asylum seekers who want to go back or were refused asylum.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{asbestos}} in new construction projects has been banned for health and safety reasons in <b>many</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> or regions, including the European Union, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and New Zealand. A notable exception is the United States, where asbestos continues {{to be used in}} construction such as cement asbestos pipes. The 5th Circuit Court prevented the EPA from banning asbestos in 1991 because EPA research showed the ban would cost between $450 and 800 million while only saving around 200 lives in a 13-year timeframe, and that the EPA did not provide adequate evidence for the safety of alternative products. Until the mid-1980s, small amounts of white asbestos were used in the manufacture of Artex, a decorative stipple finish, however, some of the lesser-known suppliers of Artex were still adding white asbestos until 1999.|$|E
