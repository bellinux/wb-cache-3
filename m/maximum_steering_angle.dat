40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical & Electronic Engineering) A {{new method}} is {{presented}} for significantly reducing {{the large number}} of complex computations associated with beamforming, -steering and adaption in large antenna arrays. The structure is based on linear interpolation over (L + 1) array elements implying that the (L - 1) antenna or sensor signals in-between are added with simple weights to the neighbouring antenna signals for beamforming and/or steering. If L is chosen to be a power of two, these simple weights become h t, i, etc. or multiples thereof. It is easily implemented on a microcomputer with shift operations and can be performed in reduced time compared to byte and word multiplications. The maximum value of L that can be used increases with decreasing mainlobe width. A problem that arises when performing beam steering on such an array is that the level of the sidelobes-more specifically the suppressed mainlobe images which are the result of the interpolation process-increase with increasing steering angle. The <b>maximum.</b> <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> is determined by the constraints placed on the sidelobe level. To be able to steer wider than the <b>maximum</b> <b>steering</b> <b>angle,</b> it becomes necessary to apply complex interpolation to the array. Complex interpolation refers to the steering of the interpolator beam. The interpolation process reduces the number of weights. This results in a significant reduction of the number of computations associated with adaptive beamforming algorithms...|$|E

40|$|Many {{advanced}} robotic {{systems are}} subject to non-holonomic constraints, e. g. wheeled mobile robots, space manipulators and multifingered robot hands. Steering these mechanisms between configurations {{in the presence of}} perturbations is a difficult problem. In fact, the divide et impera strategy (first plan a trajectory, then track it by feedback) has a fundamental drawback in this case: due to the peculiar control properties of non-holonomic systems, smooth feedback cannot provide tracking of the whole trajectory. As a result, it would be necessary to give up either accuracy in the final positioning or predictability of the actual motion. We pursue here a different approach which does not rely on a separation between planning and control. Based on the learning control paradigm, a robust steering scheme is devised for systems which can be put in chained form, a canonical structure for non-holonomic systems. By overparametrizing the control law, other performance goals can be met, typically expressed as cost functions to be minimized along the trajectory. As a case study, we consider the generation of robust optimal trajectories for a car-like mobile robot, with criteria such as total length, <b>maximum</b> <b>steering</b> <b>angle,</b> distance from workspace obstacles, or error with respect to an offline planned trajectory...|$|E

The presented LWA is highly functional and very compact supporting 1 D beam steering and multibeam operation with only a single radio frequency (RF) feeding port.

However, such an optical element will introduce large aberrations {{due to the fact}} that the surface figure of the large optics is susceptable to deformation in the space environment. We propose to use a high-resolution liquid crystal spatial light modulator to correct for wavefront aberrations introduced by the primary optical element, and to achieve very fine beam steering and shaping at the same time. A 2 -D optical phased array (OPA) antenna based on a Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCOS) spatial light modulator is described. This device offers a combination of low cost, high resolution, high accuracy, high diffraction efficiency at video speed. To quantitatively understand the influence factor of the different design parameters, a computer simulation of the device is given by the 2 -D director simulation and the Finite Difference Time domain (FDTD) simulation. For the 1 -D OPA, we define the <b>maximum</b> <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> to have a grating period of 8 pixel/reset scheme; as for larger steering angles than this criterion, the diffraction efficiency drops dramatically.

40|$|Fully {{populated}} two-dimensional (2 -D) arrays {{are needed}} to produce high quality ultrasonic volumetric images for real-time applications, but they present many challenges for their physical realization {{because of the large}} number of elements. In fact, lambda/ 2 and lambda minimum spacing between elements is required, respectively, for pyramidal and rectilinear scanning in order to avoid unwanted grating lobes (GLs). However, in past years, capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) technology has made possible the production of arrays with large flexibility in element shape and size. In this paper, this property is analyzed, and a new element shape, based on the concept of spatial interpenetration of adjacent elements, is proposed in order to design fully populated 2 -D CMUT arrays, with a low number of elements, whose beam characteristics are valid for volumetric imaging. Through the use of simulations, it is demonstrated that arrays with pitch larger than lambda (up to 3 lambda) used for rectilinear scanning, have notably lower GLs than the equivalent standard arrays designed according to the classical squared element shape. As consequence, the proposed geometry has the advantage of reducing the number of elements (up to a factor of 9) and of enlarging the element size, implying an increase of the SNR relative to the single element. When beam steering is required, arrays can be designed with pitch equal to lambda, reducing the number of elements by a factor of 4 if the <b>maximum</b> <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> is limited to plusmn 15 deg...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Prostate {{cancer and}} benign prostatic {{hyperplasia}} are very common diseases in older American men, thus having a reliable treatment modality for both diseases is of great importance. The currently used treating options, mainly surgical ones, have numerous complications, which include the many side effects that accompany such procedures, besides the invasive nature of such techniques. Focused ultrasound {{is a relatively new}} treating modality that is showing promising results in treating prostate cancer and {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}}. Thus this technique is gaining more attention in the past decade as a non-invasive method to treat both diseases. Methods In this paper, the design, construction and evaluation of a 1. 75 dimensional ultrasound phased array to be used for treating prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia is presented. With this array, the position of the focus can be controlled by changing the electrical power and phase to the individual elements for electronically focusing and steering in a three dimensional volume. The array was designed with a <b>maximum</b> <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> of ± 13. 5 ° in the transverse direction and a maximum depth of penetration of 11 cm, which allows the treatment of large prostates. The transducer piezoelectric ceramic, matching layers and cable impedance have been designed for maximum power transfer to tissue. Results To verify the capability of the transducer for focusing and steering, exposimetry was performed and the results correlated well with the calculated field. Ex vivo experiments using bovine tissue were performed with various lesion sizes and indicated the capability of the transducer to ablate tissue using short sonications. Conclusion A 1. 75 dimensional array, that overcame the drawbacks associated with one-dimensional arrays, has been designed, built and successfully tested. Design issues, such as cable and ceramic capacitances, were taken into account when designing this array. The final prototype overcame also the problem of generating grating lobes at unwanted locations by tapering the array elements. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{phased array}} systems, a partial {{beamforming}} {{can be carried}} out inside the probe {{to reduce the number of}} signals to be processed by the main system. Such technique, known as micro-beamforming, involves the application of a delay-and-sum beamforming to small groups of adjacent array elements using dedicated electronics. In this paper we show that, due to the electrostatic spring-softening effect, the phase response of Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUTs) can be controlled by varying the bias voltage. Based on this phenomenon, we propose a phase shift micro-beamforming method of CMUT arrays. We analyze the performance obtainable by applying this method to a typical phased array configuration for medical imaging. We show that, with relatively high quality factor CMUTs that still allow broadband immersion operation, it is possible to obtain up to 90 ° phase shifts by varying the bias voltage. Further, by inverting the sign of the bias voltage, we show that it is possible to obtain an additional 180 ° phase shift. Simulation results show that, with a 40 % - 3 dB one-way fractional bandwidth CMUT, the grating lobe level of the transmission radiation patterns, obtained with the proposed micro-beamforming technique, may be kept below - 23 dB using broadband excitation signals for <b>maximum</b> <b>steering</b> <b>angles</b> of ± 45 °...|$|R

Then, probabilistic topic modeling was used to discover patterns in the steering wheel movement data across the event conditions. Results indicate that drivers may make fewer abrupt steering wheel movements when they encounter unexpected crosswinds. On the contrary, drivers {{are more likely to}} make continuous faster steering corrections to compensate crosswinds when they are expected. The topic models also classify unexpected and expected crosswind events better than traditional models that use single aggregated values across events (<b>maximum</b> <b>steering</b> wheel <b>angle</b> and rate). These preliminary insights show an advantage for granular, time-series based analysis of driving data, and suggest a viable machinelearning based technique to conduct such investigations...|$|R

Additionally a <b>maximum</b> <b>steering</b> range from - 0. 75 ° to + 0. 75 ° was defined {{in order to ensure}} the best performance w. r. t. azimuth ambiguities.

40|$|Nonholonomic mobile robots, {{which have}} been {{developed}} for several decades, have been applied widely in various fields. One promising application is environmental surveys of vast areas, which require precise location and orientation control. In this research, the two-wheeled and four-wheeled mobile robots are objects of study. The path-generating regulator (PGR) was extended to track the circle/arc passage and converge to the origin with steering angle saturation. The PGR, which is a control method for robots so as to orient its heading toward the tangential direction of one of the curves belonging to the family of path functions, is applied to navigation problem for two-wheeled robot originally. Driving environments for robots are usually roads, streets, passages, and indoor. These tracks can be seen as consist of straight lines and arcs. In the case of small interval, arc can be regarded as straight line approximately, therefore we extended the PGR to drive the robot move along circle/arc passage based on the theory that PGR along straight passage. In addition, the adjustable look-ahead method is proposed to improve the robot trajectory convergence property to the target circle/arc. The effectiveness is proved trough MATLAB simulations on both the comparisons with the PGR and the improved PGR with adjustable look-ahead method. The results of numerical simulations show that the adjustable look-ahead method has better convergence property and stronger capacity of resisting disturbance. Another focus of this work analyzes the influence of steering angle saturation to the convergent property in the PGR under the feedback gain switching strategy for car-like robots. The PGR has been extended to car-like robots. Moreover, its convergent region has been expanded by the feedback gain switching strategy. However, under this strategy, when the robot restarts after the feedback gain switches, the command of the steering angle tends to be close to ±π/ 2 rad, which might exceed the <b>maximum</b> <b>steering</b> <b>angle.</b> This phenomenon causes steering angle saturation. The robot then drives along the minimum turning circle. In this paper, the convergent property of the robot under steering angle saturation is investigated. Results show that the convergent property is related strongly to the number of singular points, which depends on the center location of the minimum turning circle. The convergent properties at different locations are clarified through region division. An extended feedback gain switching strategy method is proposed to change the convergent property in the specific region. Based on simulation and experiment results, we summarize the convergent property related to the region and verify the proposed method. 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between perceptual {{information and the}} motor response during lane-change manoeuvres was studied in a fixed-based driving simulator. Eight subjects performed 48 lane changes with varying vehicle speed, lane width and direction of movement. Three sequential phases of the lane change manoeuvre are distinguished. During the first phase the steering wheel is turned to a maximum angle. After this the steering wheel is turned to the opposite direction. The second phase ends when the vehicle heading approaches a maximum that generally occurs {{at the moment the}} <b>steering</b> wheel <b>angle</b> passes through zero. During the third phase the steering wheel is turned to a second <b>maximum</b> <b>steering</b> wheel <b>angle</b> in opposite direction to stabilise the vehicle in the new lane. Duration of the separate phases were analysed together with steering amplitudes and Time-to-Line Crossing in order to test whether and how drivers use the outcome of each phase during the lane change manoeuvre to adjust the way the subsequent phase is executed. During the first phase the time margin to the outer lane boundary was controlled by the driver such that a higher speed was compensated for by a smaller steering wheel amplitude. Due to this mechanism the time margin to the lane boundary was not affected by vehicle speed. During the second phase the speed with which the steering wheel was turned to the opposite direction was affected by the time margins to the lane boundary {{at the start of the}} second phase. Thereafter, smaller minimum time margins were compensated for by a larger steering wheel amplitude to the opposite direction. The results suggest that steering actions are controlled by the outcome of previous actions in such a way that safety margins are maintained. The results also suggest that visual feedback is used by the driver during lane change manoeuvres to control steering actions, resulting in flexible and adaptive steering behaviour. Evidence is presented in support of the idea that temporal information on the {{relation between}} the vehicle and lane boundaries is used by the driver in order to control the motor response...|$|R

The primary <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> is used for the normal maneuvering whereas the secondary <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> compensates for the wiggling motion of the mobile robot that occurs frequently at the corner or at the hallway. The presented algorithm has been successfully tested on the simulation example. 1 Introduction The research on the mobile robot system calls for many disciplines such as path planning[4], world map design[8], path tracking and {{obstacle avoidance}}[1][7][9]. Among the disciplines, the obstacle avoidance is an essential component to [...] ...|$|R
