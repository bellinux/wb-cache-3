40|$|Filiform {{corrosion}} {{occurs on}} compact disc from type of CD-DA and CD-ROM that used aluminium as a reflective medium. Hence, {{the objective of}} this study is to analyse and obtain the most optimum simulation method for filiform corrosion to grow on compact disc. This study involves analysis on corroded compact disc, characterisation of compact disc, simulation study of filiform corrosion and analysis on a corrosion product. Analysis of corroded compact disc involves study on morphology and composition of corrosion product by using optical <b>microscope</b> (<b>image</b> <b>analyser)</b> and electron diffraction X-ray (ED X). The characterisation of compact disc c'overs an analysis on data, protective and metal layers that utilise infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and EDX. ...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{steel is}} {{normally}} {{used in the}} manufacture of chisels, tools parts where high hardness is required to maintain a sharp cutting edge. But, the most common problems we encountered are the short life of the tool. Hence, it is important to use a suitable medium for quenching process to extend the tool life. The main objective of this project is to analyze the internal structure of carbon steel after quenching process. Eventually, the most suitable medium for quenching carbon steel AISI 1045 will be recommended. A carbon steel rod with a diameter of 1. 6 cm was cut into the size of 2 cm in length. Six specimens in the same dimensions were prepared. Each specimen’s surface was ground by using different grade of abrasive paper. After the grinding process, three out of six specimens were undergoing quenching process for one day in three different types of medium; which is oil, water and coolant. However, another three specimens were quenched for one day. After quenching process, all specimens were grinding again to retain shining surface. Diamond liquid was used to polish the surface and then the surface was etched by 2 % nital. The internal structure of water and coolant quenching formed finer pearlite while oil quenching formed coarser pearlite. The structures formed have high hardness value ranged from 20. 3 HRC to 47. 5 HRC. The results were analyzed by using Rockwell hardness tester. The internal structure of specimen was analysed using <b>microscope</b> <b>image</b> <b>analyser</b> equipment and the results were displayed onto computer screen...|$|E
40|$|Cathodic arc {{evaporation}} CrN {{double layer}} coatings were deposited onto tool steels in two steps by industrial apparatus. Microblasting {{was performed on}} CrN first layer in order to remove metallic droplets and surface defects and to promote the adhesion of the second layer. Surface morphology effects were assessed by a scanning electron <b>microscope</b> coupled with <b>Image</b> <b>analyser</b> software. Nanoindentation and scratch tests were performed to evaluate the changes of coating adhesion and mechanical properties. Structure, microstructure and residual stress were evaluated by X-ray diffraction. In particular, by means of Cu and Cr wavelengths, the residual stresse of both steel substrates and coatings was calculated. The results show that microblasting {{has no effect on}} coating hardness and slightly affects the adhesion of the coating to the substrate. On the other hand, microblasting increases coating resistance to cohesive failure and the substrate compressive stress at the coating interface...|$|R
40|$|Titanium and its alloy {{suffer from}} galling, seizing, {{ploughing}} and adhesion during sliding contacts. A laser nitriding method {{to improve the}} tribological properties of pure titanium was investigated in this study. Before laser nitriding, a layer of nickel and chromium was plasma sprayed {{onto the surface of}} pure titanium in order to prevent the formation of cracks and pores during laser treatment. A scanning electron <b>microscope</b> (SEM) and <b>image</b> <b>analyser</b> were used to optimize the laser processing parameters and analyse the coating microstructure. X-ray diffraction (XRD), a Talysurf 5 tester and microhardness tester were used to analyse the phase crystallinity, surface roughness and micro-hardness of the laser treated coating. A ball-on-flat reciprocating wear machine was used to evaluate the sliding and fretting wear behaviours of both untreated and laser treated specimens. Results showed a substantial improvement in wear resistance after laser treatment which can be attributed to a significant improvement in hardness and corrosion resistance as well as a decrease in friction properties of nitrided layers...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{techniques}} for in vivo and in vitro angiogenesis were developed using an <b>image</b> <b>analyser.</b> In the in vivo study, a Millipore chamber filled with mouse sarcoma 180 (S 180) cells was transplanted subcutaneously to the dorsal {{side of a}} mouse, and the area of neovascularization induced by the tumour cells was quantified by image analysis. Images of vascular networks with poor contrast had their contrast improved by Laplacean transformation. The area of vascular network was 16. 9 [*]mm 2 {{in the control group}} without tumour cells and 44. 2 [*]mm 2 in the group with tumour cells, demonstrating a significant increase in neovascularized area by tumour cells. In the in vitro study, migration of vascular endothelial cells was induced with conditioned media of S 180 cells. Image analysis was used to count automatically the nuclei of migrated endothelial cells, which were stained violet with Giemsa's solution. This automated measurement by <b>image</b> <b>analyser</b> is expected to save labour and time. Checkerboard analysis revealed that the endothelial cell migration induced by S 180 -conditioned medium was due to chemotaxis. The quantitation method using an automated <b>image</b> <b>analyser</b> is valuable in evaluating the induction of neovascularization by tumours and the effect of pharmacological agents on tumour angiogenesis in vivo and in vitr...|$|R
