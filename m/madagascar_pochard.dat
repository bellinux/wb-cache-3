50|$|The lake {{is also an}} {{important}} but increasingly threatened habitat for waterbirds, including the endangered Meller's duck (Anas melleri). Two waterbird species were endemic to northern Madagascar, the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>pochard</b> (Aythya innotata) and the Alaotra grebe (Tachybaptus rufolavatus). The <b>Madagascar</b> <b>pochard</b> is now critically endangered and no longer found on the lake, although very small numbers exist elsewhere. The Alaotra grebe was declared extinct in 2010. In earlier times, Lake Alaotra was where the largest numbers lived, the near-flightless grebe may never have occurred elsewhere except in the immediate area of the lake.|$|E
50|$|The Madagascan pochard or <b>Madagascar</b> <b>pochard</b> (Aythya innotata; Fotsy maso, Onjo) is an {{extremely}} rare diving duck of the genus Aythya. Thought to be extinct in the late 1990s, specimens of the species were rediscovered at Lake Matsaborimena in Madagascar in 2006. As of March 2013, the population is around 80 individuals.|$|E
50|$|The redhead and {{the common}} pochard form a sister group which itself is sister to the canvasback. This group is then sister to the {{monophyletic}} group consisting of the white-eyes (hardhead, <b>Madagascar</b> <b>pochard,</b> and the sister species ferruginous duck and baer's pochard) and scaups (New Zealand scaup, ring-necked duck, tufted duck, greater scaup, lesser scaup).|$|E
50|$|The {{reports of}} Bernardin and (1710) Boucher are puzzling insofar as that they mention both geese, sarcelles (teals, this species) {{as well as}} canards (ducks, larger than sarcelles) as {{occurring}} or having occurred on Réunion. It is possible that a carpometacarpus bone apparently of an Aythya diving duck is referrable to these canards. If so, these birds were probably related to the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>pochard,</b> of which only small numbers are known to remain.|$|E
50|$|The Pan Africa Raptor Conservation Program is {{designed}} to help stem the loss of biodiversity in Africa. Many species threatened by habitat loss have been surveyed, including the Cape vulture and Taita falcon in southern Africa and the African fish eagle, augur buzzard, Sokoke scops owl, Pemba scops owl, Ruppell's vulture, African white-backed vulture, and crowned eagle in several nations in East Africa. The Peregrine Fund has biologists and field workers in Madagascar, an island off the east coast of Africa with vast biological diversity. In 2006, they re-discovered the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>pochard,</b> a diving duck thought to be extinct, while searching for Madagascar harriers. The Peregrine Fund also re-discovered the Madagascar serpent eagle and red owl in 1993, both long thought to be extinct, and helped create Madagascar's largest rainforest reserve in 1997. In 2015, the Fund's Malagasy biologists successfully protected three new areas, totally more than 190,000 hectares, that {{have been added to the}} country’s national park system and will be managed by and for local people to benefit many endangered species.|$|E
40|$|Ten wildfowl taxa are {{resident}} in Madagascar including four endemics: Madagascar White-backed Duck Thalassornis leuconotus insularis, Madagascar Teal Anas bernieri, Meller’s Duck A. melleri and <b>Madagascar</b> <b>Pochard</b> Aythya innotata. These endemic duck taxa were amongst the last wildfowl forms {{to be described}} in Africa and are undoubtedly currently the rarest in this region. The history of our knowledge of these birds follows four easily definable stages: discovery, understanding, protection and the future. The new millennium has started with a much more detailed understanding of the four ducks ’ ecology than ever before, the protection of several key sites and the re-discovery in 2006 of the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>Pochard.</b> The next few years will tell if the ducks have a more secure future and, while not yet safe, Madagascar’s ducks are perhaps now among the better known of Africa’s endemic wildfowl. Key words: endemic, Madagascar, protection, status review, wildfowl. Madagascar has ten extant species of wildfowl (Anatidae) with a further two species (of sheldgeese) Centrornis majori and Alopochen sirabensis known only from sub-fossil remains (Table 1) (Young et al. 2003; Young & Kear 2006). The extant taxa include three full endemic species and an endemic subspecies with varied geographical origins: two species – Madagascar Teal Anas bernieri and <b>Madagascar</b> <b>Pochard</b> Aythya innotata – are of Australo/Asian origins, and two others...|$|E
