Author: Lucie Průšová Department: Department of Econometrics Supervisor: doc. Ing. Milada Lagová, CSc. This thesis deals with linear programming problems with additional requirements that values of variables are greater or lower than a specified bound. Where applicable, the variable is limited on both sides. These values {{are called the}} upper and lower bounds. Lower bound can be a minimum required number of manufactured products and upper bound a <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>quantity</b> of a substance in the mixture. The thesis contain a formulation of original LP problems with lower and upper bounds which are solved by standard simplex method and by its modification for bounded variables. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze and compare the reduced costs and shadow prices in the mentioned class of problems. At the end there will summarize the results of this work...|$|E
40|$|Extending {{the life}} of the HFIR {{pressure}} vessel from 26 to 50 EFPY (100 MW) requires an updated calculation of the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pressure for a range in vessel operating temperatures (40 - 120 F). The <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pressure is calculated using the equal-potential method, which takes advantage of knowledge gained from periodic hydrostatic proof tests and uses the test conditions (pressure, temperature, and frequency) as input. The <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pressure decreases with increasing time between hydro tests but is increased each time a test is conducted. The minimum values that occur just prior to a test either increase or decrease with time, depending on the vessel temperature. The minimum value of these minimums is presently specified as the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pressure. For three vessel temperatures of particular interest (80, 88, and 110 F) and a nominal time of 3. 0 EFPY(100 MVV) between hydro tests, these pressures are 677, 753, and 850 psi. For the lowest temperature of interest (40 F), the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pressure is 295 psi...|$|R

A very simple and straightforward method of determining the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> loading and voltage stability margin of a power system using information about the current operating point is proposed. The method simply requires some locally measurable quantities, such as bus voltage magnitude, and current data at present operating point. The measured data are carefully processed to estimate the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> loading and voltage stability margin of a system. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 6 -bus and 14 -bus syste...|$|R

40|$|Commonly used compact {{fluorescent}} lamps (CFLs) with electronic gear are characterized by extremely distorted current, with total harmonic distortion (THD) usually exceeding 100 %. That is why they cause a significant voltage distortion in electrical installations. The principal goal {{of this research was}} to determine their <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> share in the total load installed for commercial customers, at which voltage distortion is still acceptable (according to international standards). An analysis regarding a low-voltage electrical installation of a hotel, representing a typical commercial customer, showed that <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> share should not exceed 10 %. As this <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> share could restrict the installment of the intended quantity of CFLs, the costs of two possible solutions for this problem - the use of filters or a new generation of CFLs with a high power factor - are compared.
