The {{imprinter}} <b>bottom</b> <b>roller</b> {{is under}} very high linear pressure during the work, which often causes wear and damage between <b>bottom</b> <b>roller</b> and anvil roller. Traditionally, the extra strength design method is frequently {{used in the}} design of imprinter <b>bottom</b> <b>roller,</b> which leads to the waste of materials and increase of weights. So, reasonable processing craft and appropriate theoretical analysis method should be adopted to improve the manufacturing of <b>bottom</b> <b>roller</b> and make the material strength into full use, in the condition of meeting the structure safety standard. This paper gives a brief analysis of the process craft of <b>bottom</b> <b>roller</b> and uses finite element technique to give the <b>bottom</b> <b>roller</b> numerical simulation and FEA of its deflection and strength. The results show that: in the process of work, the distribution of stress changes largely and unevenly. The stress and deformation in middle part prove the largest with decreasing to both sides successively. The imprinter <b>bottom</b> <b>roller</b> produces a maximum displacement of 0. 0516 mm, which meets the work requirements...|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of the bachelor´s thesis {{introduces}} crawler chassis used in forwarders and harvesters, its second part includes a concept design of a crawler chassis for a forwarder based on the given parameters. The design concentrates on the arrangement of the undercarriage and the choice of suitable track and idlers. Another intention of the design is to find an appropriate solution for suspension of <b>bottom</b> <b>rollers</b> with a sufficient travel, while observing small dimensions of the undercarriage. The outcome of the thesis is a drawing of the designed crawler chassis...|$|R

With the Bardiche the head of the axe is usually affixed to the haft near the <b>middle</b> or <b>bottom,</b> however in almost all versions of the epsilon axe the blade is attached at three different points: top, <b>middle,</b> <b>bottom.</b> These tangs would be wedged into the grooves of the heft.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the quantitative relationships between the mechanical performance of a ring-spinning triangle and the spinning parameters by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The constituent fibers in the ring-spinning triangle are considered as three-dimensional elastic beam elements with tensile, compressive, torsional, and bending capabilities. The accuracy of the proposed FEM model in calculating the fiber tension distribution of the spinning triangle has been validated by comparing it with earlier models and experimental data. Compared with the earlier models, some important theoretical factors ignored previously, including the fiber torsional strain and the frictional contact of fibers with the <b>bottom</b> <b>roller,</b> are considered in the current model. With the input of various spinning parameters, some essential factors of the spinning triangle, including the fiber tension distribution and fiber torsion distribution, are numerically examined and their quantitative relationships are discussed in detail.
