5|$|Indiana was {{admitted}} to the Union on December 11, 1816. The original 1816 Constitution of Indiana provided for the election of a governor and a lieutenant governor every three years. The second and current constitution of 1851 lengthened terms to four years and set the commencement of the governor's term on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> January following the election. Governors were allowed to serve for four years in any eight-year period, but this was extended by a 1972 amendment permitting governors to serve for eight years in any twelve-year period. Should the office of governor become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. Nine lieutenant governors have succeeded to the governorship. If the office of lieutenant governor is vacant, the president pro tempore of the Indiana Senate becomes governor; this has happened once, when James B. Ray succeeded William Hendricks.|$|E

She posted the edited one-minute clip to several popular Internet video hosting services by the following <b>Monday.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first week, the video received over 500,000 total views on YouTube, 350,000 views on Revver, 500,000 views on Break.com and 1,100,000 views on Yahoo Video, as self-reported by the four popular Internet video sites as of August 22. Total views were reported to exceed 8 million by the end of 2007. Ezarik said she earned $2,000 from the video from Revver.|$|E
5|$|The Florida Constitution of 1838 {{provided}} that a governor be elected every four years, {{who was not}} allowed to serve consecutive terms. The secessionist constitution of 1861 would have reduced this to two years and removed the term limit, but the state fell to the Union before the first election under that constitution. The rejected constitution of 1865 and the ratified constitution of 1868 maintained the four-year term, though without the earlier term limit, which was reintroduced in the 1885 constitution. The current constitution of 1968 states that should the governor serve, or would have served had he not resigned, more than six years in two consecutive terms, he cannot be elected to the succeeding term. The start of a term was set in 1885 at the first Tuesday after the first <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> January following the election, where it has remained.|$|E

5|$|The state {{constitution}} of 1912 {{called for the}} election of a governor every two years. The term was increased to four years by a 1968 amendment. The constitution originally included no term limit, but an amendment passed in 1992 allows governors to succeed themselves only once; before this, four governors were elected more than twice in a row. Gubernatorial terms begin on the first <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> January following the election. Governors who have served the two term limit can run again after four years out of office.|$|E
5|$|Washington was {{admitted}} to the Union on November 11, 1889. The term for governor is four years, commencing on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> January following the election. If the office of governor is vacant or the governor is unable to discharge their duties, the lieutenant governor assumes the office of governor. If both the offices of governor and lieutenant governor are unable to fulfill their duties, the secretary of state is next in line, and then the treasurer. There is no limit to the number of terms a governor may serve. The office of lieutenant governor is not elected on the same ticket as the governor.|$|E
5|$|The current Constitution of Connecticut, {{ratified}} in 1965, {{calls for}} a four-year term for the governor, commencing on the Wednesday after the first <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> January following an election. The previous constitution of 1818 originally had only a one-year term for governor; this was increased {{to two years in}} 1875, and four years in 1948. The 1875 amendment also set the start date of the term to its current date; before then, it was the first Wednesday in the May following an election. The constitution provides for the election of a lieutenant governor for the same term as the governor. The two offices are elected on the same ticket; this provision was added in 1962. In the event of a vacancy in the office of governor, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. Before the adoption of the 1965 constitution, the lieutenant governor only acted as governor. There is no limit of any kind on the number of terms one may serve.|$|E

5|$|The first {{constitution}} of 1803 allowed governors to serve for two three-year terms, limited to six of any eight years, commencing {{on the first}} <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> December following an election. The current {{constitution of}} 1851 removed the term limit, and shifted {{the start of the}} term to the second Monday in January following an election. In 1908, Ohio switched from holding elections in odd-numbered years to even-numbered years, with the preceding governor (from the 1905 election) serving an extra year. A 1957 amendment lengthened the term to four years and allowed governors to only succeed themselves once, having to wait four years after their second term in a row before being allowed to run again. An Ohio Supreme Court ruling in 1973 clarified this to mean governors could theoretically serve unlimited terms, as long as they waited four years after every second term.|$|E

Accordingly, accompanied by his father, Dominic met John Bosco on the first <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> month of October, 1854. John Bosco records this conversation in some detail.

Those who are unable to follow the strict observance may eat on Tuesday and Thursday (but not, if possible, on <b>Monday)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening after Vespers, when they may take bread and water, or perhaps tea or fruit juice, but not a cooked meal.

500|$|Idaho was {{admitted}} to the Union on July 3, 1890. Since then, the state has had 32 governors, two of whom served non-consecutive terms.

Prior to 1946, the offices were elected to terms of two years. If the office of governor is vacant or the governor is out of state or unable to discharge his duties, the lieutenant governor acts as governor until such time as the disability is removed. [...] If both the offices of governor and lieutenant governor are vacant or both those officers are unable to fulfill their duties, the President pro tempore of the Idaho Senate is next in line, and then the Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives. After the change to four-year terms, self-succession (re-election) was not initially allowed; newly elected Governor Robert E. Smylie, formerly the state's attorney general, successfully lobbied the 1955 legislature to propose an amendment to the state constitution to allow gubernatorial re-election, which was approved by voters in the 1956 general election. There is no limit to the number of terms a governor may serve.|$|E
