50|$|The Bell {{would sound}} every hour and half hour and also {{signified}} {{the start and}} end of all important activities in the town {{at a time when}} few citizens had their own time-telling devices. It was also used to announce major festivities (i.e. national celebrations and election victories), while it has been recorded that on several occasions the bell cracked from the simultaneous mechanical and <b>manual</b> <b>ringing</b> by enthusiastic locals. The arched entrance of the clock tower was until 1900-1910 decorated with a relief depiction of a handshake: this was the medieval emblem of Kefalonia and was used to decorate all public buildings of the time. Throughout the duration of the British occupation a clock winder had been appointed to tend to the clock's proper operation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Manual</b> zoom <b>ring</b> and {{optional}} use of <b>manual</b> focus <b>ring</b> (fly-by-wire). Autofocus uses hybrid {{phase detection}} system (sensors above the lens) for quick focus assist followed by contrast detection system (TTL) for fine focus. Phase detection {{system should be}} switched off in the menu when accessory lenses are mounted.|$|R
50|$|Zoom burst is a {{photographic}} technique, attainable with zoom lenses with a <b>manual</b> zoom <b>ring.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{very early}} cameras had {{diaphragms}} {{external to the}} lens often consisting of a rotating circular plate {{with a number of}} holes of increasing size drilled through the plate. Rotating the plate would bring an appropriate sized hole in front of the lens. All modern lenses use a multi-leaf diaphragm so that at the central intersection of the leaves a more or less circular aperture is formed. Either a <b>manual</b> <b>ring,</b> or an electronic motor controls the angle of the diaphragm leaves and thus the size of the opening.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, {{because of}} its {{functions}}, {{it is as though}} the FZ20 has come down to size. The only functions that the FZ5 does not include is its <b>manual</b> focus <b>ring,</b> flash hotshoe, and ED lens-element.|$|R
5000|$|The lens showcases {{a glossy}} black (or silver) plastic {{exterior}} with the Sigma Art [...] "A" [...] badge {{on the side}} of the lens. It features a large <b>manual</b> focus <b>ring</b> and a detachable barrel-type lens hood.|$|R
5000|$|The EF 50mm 1.8 II {{replaced}} the EF 50mm 1.8 in 1991. The EF 50mm 1.8 II {{has lost the}} metal lens mount, the distance scale, the IR focusing label and the separate <b>manual</b> focusing <b>ring</b> {{that came with the}} original EF 50mm 1.8.|$|R
5000|$|An aesthetically updated version, the Sigma 30mm F2.8 DN Art was {{announced}} by Sigma on January 29, 2013. It has a glossy black (or silver) plastic exterior with the Sigma Art [...] "A" [...] badge {{on the side}} of the lens. It features a large <b>manual</b> focus <b>ring</b> and a detachable barrel-type lens hood.|$|R
50|$|Focus {{indication}} {{also came}} in the form of a green hexagonal in-focus light-emitting diode (LED) flanked by two red arrowhead shaped, out-of-focus, turning direction LED indicators visible at the bottom of the viewfinder. If both red LEDs lit, the ME F could not determine correct focus. In that case, the 35mm-70mm lens had a backup <b>manual</b> focus <b>ring.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The lens showcases a {{matte black}} plastic {{exterior}} with the Sigma Contemporary [...] "C" [...] badge {{on the side}} of the lens. It features a large <b>manual</b> focus <b>ring</b> and a detachable barrel-type lens hood. The lens is the updated version of the Sigma 30mm F2.8 Art lens, including autofocus and improving upon overall image quality, sharpness, and a faster maximum aperture.|$|R
50|$|The Konica Minolta DiMAGE A2 is a discontinued, 8 {{megapixel}} CCD digital camera. Sony {{bought out}} the Konica Minolta line {{and from that}} came the new Sony line called the Sony Alpha series. The A2's features include a <b>manual</b> focus <b>ring,</b> time lapse options, a 922,000 pixel viewfinder, and an articulating rear 1.8 inch screen and a 7× zoom barrel. The camera was produced with a fixed lens and electronic viewfinder.|$|R
5000|$|The 2003 CRF150F was styled after Honda's racing bikes, with tuned {{suspension}} and [...] engine. It had a 5 speed <b>manual</b> transmission, O <b>ring</b> chain drive, and the Pirelli MT18 tires. The front brake was a 240mm hydraulic disc brake.|$|R
50|$|The {{camcorder}} {{had three}} 1/4-inch CCDs, which provided an exceptionally high-quality video image for a handheld camcorder of the period. It {{also had a}} 3.5-inch LCD screen, a color viewfinder, a 12x optical zoom, a 48x digital zoom, and a <b>manual</b> focus <b>ring.</b> (Often overlooked in consumer camcorders, this feature allows you to focus using a mechanical ring around the lens, offering precise control.) The camcorder included a FireWire port for transferring video to a computer.|$|R
50|$|With the Maxxum line, {{the heavy}} duty metal bodies of earlier Minoltas were {{abandoned}} {{in favor of}} lighter and less expensive plastics. The Maxxum 7000, {{the most popular of}} the new Maxxums, introduced the innovation of arrow buttons for setting aperture and shutter speed, rather than a shutter speed dial on the body and an aperture ring on the lens. That way, the only control necessary on the lens is the <b>manual</b> focus <b>ring</b> (plus the zoom ring in the case of zoom lenses).|$|R
5000|$|The current EF 50mm 1.8 II lens has {{a plastic}} lens mount. The <b>manual</b> {{focusing}} <b>ring</b> {{has been replaced}} by a very small thin focusing ring on the front tip of the lens. However the lens does not suffer from rotating front lens element and can be used with polarizing filters. The optics for both lenses are identical, with 6 elements in 5 groups and a 5 blade diaphragm. Nevertheless, some photographers think the original EF 50mm 1.8 is slightly better [...] Both lenses have a 52mm filter thread.|$|R
5000|$|Like the [...] "crippled" [...] KAF mount used on {{previous}} Pentax digital SLRs, the [...] "crippled" [...] KAF2 lacks the mechanism to mechanically sense a lens's aperture ring setting. For that reason, {{when using the}} <b>manual</b> aperture <b>ring</b> on K-mount lenses, {{it is necessary to}} set the 'Use aperture ring' setting in the 'Custom Menu' to 'Permitted' and use stop-down metering mode (Pentax calls it optical preview) to ensure proper exposure. KA and KAF lenses with aperture rings are fully compatible when the aperture ring is set to automatic ('A'), giving control over the aperture to the camera body.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade {{telecommunication}} operators have been deploying WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) technology to satisfy the exponential growth in global communication. While facilitating the advanced information society of today, this has also led to a higher dependency on the networks, and furthermore the high capacity utilisation of optical fibres means that a single link failure will influence many users and enterprises. For these reasons, protection of network connections {{has become a major}} competitive parameter for the operators. Currently, the most popular protection method is ring protection, due to its simplicity, requiring only basic management functionality and operating with local restoration control. While many optical rings have been deployed, little work has been published on exactly what the cost of ring networks are, compared to general mesh networks. In this article we perform a quantitative comparison between ring protection and mesh protection, using real world network data and realistic prices for network components. Extending classic LP flow models to take rings and node costs into account, and using a link-path based mesh network LP model, we are able to perform a total cost comparison of the two architectures, and of <b>manual</b> <b>ring</b> network design. The results suggest that the price of mesh network components must be reduced significantly to be competitive with ring based networks, and also that manual network design does not necessarily lead to the most cost-efficient designs. c ○ 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
50|$|The {{camera was}} {{positioned}} {{as a step}} up for amateur photographers who were ready to move beyond basic Point-and-Shoot models. The ability to override automated features was quite limited; there was, for example, no <b>manual</b> focus <b>ring,</b> and exposure was computer controlled with a limited range of exposure compensation. An unusual feature of the camera was an Auto Composing Mode in which the camera could automatically zoom to the focal length it deemed most appropriate for a given scene. Also unusual for its time was a dual autofocus system (using both passive phase detection and an infrared sensor), and {{the inclusion of a}} Slow Flash Sync mode that allowed for better balancing of ambient and flash light.|$|R
50|$|Photography blog has {{reviewed}} {{the camera and}} has generally good things to say. They do note the peculiar layout of the dials and buttons {{on the back of}} the camera. They offer that the dial should have more options on it, rather than forcing the user to delve into menus to get to settings that would normally appear on the setting dial. They also point out that because the lenses for this camera do not have <b>manual</b> focusing <b>rings,</b> the <b>manual</b> focus that the camera does have is rudimentary at best. According to the review, it lags in wake-up time from sleep mode, picture review right after taking a picture is too long and its lack of ports make it uncompatible with other Nikon 1 accessories.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>manual</b> zoom <b>ring</b> {{allows a}} smooth {{progression}} from 35-420 mm equivalent and silent zooms when recording movies. The camera also includes an [...] "extended optical zoom" [...] system providing greater optical zoom ability when shooting at lower resolutions, giving up to 19.3× optical zoom at 3MP. Apertures from f/2.8 to f/11 are supported, though the larger apertures {{are not available}} at high zoom levels (f/3.7 at full zoom). Shutter speeds range from 60 secs to 1/2000 sec. Auto-focus and a [...] "Macro" [...] autofocus modes are available, or a fluid-damped focus ring can be used. The AF-macro setting can be selected for all camera modes. The camera also has a macro capability (5 cm minimum focal range at 1× zoom).|$|R
5000|$|The 'L' lens is {{identified}} by a red stripe round the lens barrel. It {{is a totally}} separate classification of lens, much larger and up to three times heavier, sharing very little if any features with the non-L versions. The L version is considerably faster, with an aperture range of f/2.8-4.0 (as opposed to f/3.5-5.6). Unlike newer L-series lenses, {{it is not a}} constant aperture lens; the maximum aperture of this lens varied with the zoom (f/2.8 @ 28 mm, f/4.0 @ 80 mm). It uses a ring USM, and as several early professional USM lenses, manual focus is performed with a [...] "focus by wire" [...] arrangement. The <b>manual</b> focus <b>ring</b> is a digital input that directs the lens computer to adjust focus using the autofocus motor. This was done to allow full-time manual focus with the relatively new ultrasonic motors. This lens predates the lower cost, non-L versions and production of this version ended in approximately 1996.|$|R

50|$|Halloween Night - Journalist Ms. Quinn {{comes to}} the Statesville Mental Hospital to {{interview}} Warden Kane. The warden introduces Ms. Quinn to five of the asylum’s most notorious serial killer inmates. Jeffrey Ramses was a chef who became known as “Animal the Cannibal” for serving victims to his customers. Murderous dentist Bradford Young is known as “Dr. Suave.” Walter Harris is “The Taxidermist.” “Rocco the Clown” was an underground wrestler who killed his opponents in the <b>ring.</b> <b>Manual</b> Dyer was a cult leader who considered himself a prophet, but {{is referred to as}} “Mental Manny” because of his psychosis.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} above examples, {{describing}} thumb ring designs from other time periods is difficult. For example, thumb rings are absent from the archaeological record between the Han and Ming dynasties (220-1368 CE) even though contemporary literature (such as Wang Ju's archery manual from the Tang dynasty) indicates that Chinese archers were still using the thumb draw. Moreover, evidence suggests a variety of ring shapes were popular during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644 CE). Li Chengfen's archery <b>manual</b> advocated using <b>rings</b> with oval openings, and Gao Ying's archery manual described the use of lipped rings and contained illustrations depicting an archer using a lipped ring. To date, however, the only recovered rings that purport {{to be from the}} Ming dynasty have cylindrical designs that are different from Qing thumb rings.|$|R
