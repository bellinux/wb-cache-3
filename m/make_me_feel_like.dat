500|$|... {{utterance}} of 'you're my James Dean / you <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I'm seventeen' on 'Rather Die Young' is made tolerable by her honeyed vocal slides. Certainly, the 'bad boy' Beyoncé is in {{love with}} is more a physical representation of countless painfully banal fantasies about guys who 'drive too fast' and 'smoke too much' than an actual person, but at least it feels tangible. For once, the pop song trying to make a connection with its listener doesn't feel like a total fraud. Forget Lady Gaga's song about her relationship with her father or Britney Spears' lullaby to her babies – here, I'm convinced, if only for a moment, that Beyoncé really would rather die young than to live her life without her lover, that she cares, even if you don't. This doesn't fully explain why 4 is as enjoyable as it is, but it does convey just how convincing Beyoncé can be when given the right tools – {{and it turns out that}} those tools consist of not much more than Beyoncé's voice itself.|$|E

500|$|During {{promotion}} for Carey's self-titled {{debut album}} (1990), she appeared on The Arsenio Hall Show to perform her first single, [...] "Vision of Love". During the very much talked about performance, singer-songwriter Carole King {{had been watching}} Carey perform, taking interest in her and her material. One year later, during the recording sessions for Carey's second studio album, Emotions (1991), King contacted Carey, asking if she {{would be interested in}} covering [...] "(You <b>Make</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Like)</b> A Natural Woman", a song she had written alongside Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin. Carey declined, feeling uneasy about covering a song one of her musical influences executed so perfectly. Still determined to work with Carey, King flew out to New York City for one day, in hopes of writing and composing a ballad of some sort. Throughout the day, the two songwriters exchanged musical ideas and melodies on the piano until [...] "If It's Over" [...] came into conception. In an interview following the collaboration, King said the following regarding Carey: [...] "I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings." ...|$|E
500|$|In the NME, Tony Tyler {{began his}} review {{by stating that}} he had long idolised Harrison as [...] "the finest {{packaged}} object since frozen pizza", but he had changed his opinion dramatically in recent years; after the [...] "dire, ennui-making" [...] All Things Must Pass, Tyler continued, [...] "the unworthiness of my heretical thoughts smote home {{around the time of}} the Bangla Desh concerts." [...] Tyler dismissed Material World with the description: [...] " [...] pleasant, competent, vaguely dull and inoffensive. It’s also breathtakingly unoriginal and – lyrically at least – turgid, repetitive and so damn holy I could scream." [...] The reviewer concluded: [...] "I have no doubt whatever it'll sell like hot tracts and that George'll donate all the profits to starving Bengalis and <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the cynical heel I undoubtedly am." [...] In their 1975 book , Tyler and co-author Roy Carr bemoaned Harrison's [...] "didactically imposing [...] said Holy Memoirs upon innocent record-collectors" [...] and declared the album's spiritual theme [...] "almost as offensive in its own way" [...] as Lennon and Yoko Ono's political radicalism on Some Time in New York City (1972).|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] {{talks about}} the {{inability}} to fight what the heart wants, {{even if it is}} wrong. Beyoncé prostrates herself at the mercy of an indifferent love interest, telling him that she would rather die young than to live her life without him. Beyoncé also sings about leaving a legacy as she shows her [...] "epic" [...] neediness to her love interest, as stated by Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club. The music stays soft in the first verse, where Beyoncé likens her romantic interest to American actor James Dean, [...] "You're my James Dean / you <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I'm seventeen". She also relates about how good girls often fall for bad boys; she affirms that [...] "bad boy" [...] she loves, [...] "drive too fast" [...] and [...] "smoke too much". During the chorus, Beyoncé projects the image of a woman, who wants to love and be loved regardless of what others may say, [...] "I'd rather die young / Than live my life without you / Rather not live at all". As the song progresses, Beyoncé references [...] "some deeper emotional fires burning" [...] as she sings, [...] "Nobody understands what we've been through".|$|E

500|$|Rihanna's voice spans one-and-a-half octaves in [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", from F3 to C5, and her vocal has a [...] "silky", [...] "seductive" [...] tone. In the song's lyrics Rihanna yearns for her lover's attention, {{which makes}} her feel like the only girl in the world. The singer [...] "pours her heart out" [...] in the chorus: [...] "Want you to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I'm the only girl in the world/ Like I'm {{the only one that}} you'll ever love/ Like I'm the only one who knows your heart/ Only girl in the world." [...] According to Digital Spy writer Nick Levine, the chorus [...] "thumps like a rabbit having an epileptic fit." [...] Rihanna sings suggestively, [...] "Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin'/ You can come inside/ And when you enter, you ain't leavin'/ Be my {{prisoner}} for the night." [...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC compared the song's message to that of the German fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel"; Rihanna is not willing to throw her hair out of the castle for just any man to come and satisfy her, [...] "particularly not someone who isn't prepared to make the climb up to her scarily high window." ...|$|E
500|$|Marge's {{flashback}} {{of her and}} {{her sisters}} swimming in a lake is based on The Prince of Tides. The singers at Duff Gardens, Hooray for Everything, are a parody of the musical group Up with People. The group is seen performing a kid-friendly version of the Lou Reed song [...] "Walk on the Wild Side". Homer and Bart start to sing [...] "Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead" [...] from The Wizard of Oz. The poem that Great Aunt Gladys reads {{at the start of}} her video will is [...] "The Road Not Taken" [...] by Robert Frost. [...] Duff Gardens is a parody of Busch Gardens, originally developed as a marketing vehicle for the Anheuser-Busch brewing company. [...] The song and ride that Bart, Lisa, and Selma go on, with animatronic kids {{from all over the world}} singing is a parody of the song [...] "It's a Small World". The Duff Gardens parade is a parody of Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade.as Lisa's hallucination where she sees Selma after drinking the water on the ride is based on the work of artist Ralph Steadman, particularly in the novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. When Lisa says [...] "I am the Lizard Queen!", it is a tribute to Jim Morrison's poem [...] "Celebration of the Lizard". After acquiring Jub-Jub, Selma sings [...] "(You <b>Make</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Like)</b> A Natural Woman", a reference to the season four finale of the sitcom Murphy Brown, in which reporter Murphy Brown sings the song after giving birth to her baby.|$|E
500|$|Mars co-wrote [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine of The Smeezingtons. The three co-produced {{the song}} with Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker, and Emile Haynie. It {{was written in}} the key of D minor, with Mars's vocals range from the low note of A3 to the high note of C5. Levine {{aforementioned}} that some parts in the song are not instruments as Mars said they needed [...] "a dep-dep-dep-dep sound". Later, Levine told Mars to [...] "sing it into the microphone", where he chopped it up, and despite sounding like an instrument, the sounds are really Mars' voice. The song's composition relies mainly on a [...] "guitar-worthy groove guitar, a soaring sing-along chorus and sexual innuendo galore". It finds Mars singing a confession of a relationship that is so good that he repeats to his love [...] "Your sex takes me to paradise", a verse inspired by Halle Berry [...] "You <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I've been locked out of heaven for too long/ Can I just stay here, {{spend the rest of my}} days here?" [...] he sings. During his Google Hangout on the day of the song's release, Mars was asked by a fan to name his favorite lyrics from the track. Mars picked the phrase [...] "But swimming in your water is something spiritual," [...] and said that the single's exploration of feeling and being in love fits into the [...] "sensual, sensual and sensual" [...] theme of the album.|$|E

500|$|Carolyn Menyes of Music Times complimented the song's time {{signature}} {{for adding}} [...] "a {{bit of a}} waltz flavor, channeling the old school Ariana that fans first fell in love with", adding that [...] "a sultry, distorted guitar line and Grande's passionate, soaring vocals add a sense of texture and modernity that makes 'Dangerous Woman' feel as powerful as the title." [...] A writer of NME felt that Grande [...] "shows herself as someone who continues to be determined to challenge the norm." [...] The publication as well pointed out that [...] " [...] does sound empowered, even if it doesn't sound especially dangerous {{for her in the}} wake of her 2014 collaboration 'Love Me Harder' with The Weeknd." [...] Writing for Idolator, Robbie Daw, Carl Williot and Mike Wass reviewed [...] "Dangerous Woman" [...] during their [...] "Pop Perspective" [...] article, with Daw calling it [...] "one walk of danger worth taking", Williot praising her vocal performance and highlighting the [...] "clever little flip of '(You <b>Make</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Like)</b> A Natural Woman'", and Wass naming it a [...] "decent song" [...] but noting that [...] " [...] still hasn't found her own lane." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy praised Grande's vocals, describing as [...] "angelic" [...] and completed writing it [...] "almost sound too pure over the seductive guitar line and prowling beat, which threatens to blindfold you and tie up your wrists within one listen.". Reviewing the album with the same name, the editor from Sputnikmusic described the song as [...] "the first moment that the album really shows flashes of becoming something special," [...] and continued, [...] "as it sways to a seductive beat that feels like it was extrapolated from the most revealing scene of a James Bond film." [...] Quinn Maryland of Pitchfork shared similar opinion, the reviewer described it as [...] "a slinky, empowered, Bond theme of a belter;" ...|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{aside from}} the three men, Carey worked with Carole King, a female singer-songwriter who had been {{predominantly}} popular in the 1970s. However, unlike with C+C Music Factory, King approached Carey, hoping {{to work with her}} after hearing her perform live on The Arsenio Hall Show. During a conversation with Carey, King suggested that she cover [...] "(You <b>Make</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Like)</b> A Natural Woman," [...] a song she had written with Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin. After giving it some thought, Carey declined the offer, feeling uncomfortable about recording a song she felt one of her musical influences performed so perfectly. Still determined on working with Carey, King flew to New York for one day, to try to create a ballad of some sort. The two ladies sat together by a piano {{over the course of the}} day, and by nightfall, had written and arranged a song titled [...] "If It's Over." [...] After working with Carey, King said in an interview [...] "I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings." [...] After recording [...] "If It's Over," [...] Carey expressed the musical connection she shared with Afanasieff, as well as the creative format in which she wrote and produced her music when with him, or working with C+C Music Factory. When working with Afanasieff, the duo would sit by a piano, and lead each other vocally and musically, until they would reach the right note and arrangement. During an interview in 1992, Afanasieff described how Carey would stand next to him, and begin singing different notes and tunes she was thinking of, while he would follow her with the piano. In doing so, he would help lead her to the right note and vice versa. Carey described their working relationship as [...] "very unique," [...] and felt it to be very similar to the form in which she had worked with Margulies. While similar, Carey's creative process with Cole and Clivillés proved different; they would bring her several different tapes and tunes, of which she would choose from. Afterwards, they would work on building the already created melody, and have Carey add and build onto it, as well as writing the lyrics and key.|$|E
