In a ceremony on January 18, 1983, the IOC presented two of Thorpe's children, Gale and Bill, with commemorative medals. Thorpe's original medals had been held in museums, but they had been stolen and have never been recovered. Although Thorpe is listed as a gold medalist by the IOC, his results from 1912 have not been restored to the official Olympic records.|$|E

25|$|However Subhas Chandra Bose, {{who was one}} of {{the most}} {{prominent}} leaders of the Indian movement at the time (rivalling Gandhi in stature), arrived in Germany in April 1941 after escaping from house arrest in Calcutta. He met with Hitler (with whom he had one meeting) and the Nazi high command, <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for raising an Indian unit from Rommel's Indian prisoners of war from the battlefields of Europe and Africa, as the nucleus of an Indian Liberation force. The Indische Legion was thus formed. In January 1942, a small contingent parachuted into Eastern Iran with a Brandenburg unit to commence sabotage operations against the British. Most of the legion however only ever saw action in Europe, fighting as a Heer unit and later incorporated into the Waffen SS (as were other national legions of the Wehrmacht) after the Allied invasion of France. Nearly thirty, including the leadership and the officer corps, were also transferred to Azad Hind after its formation, and saw action in the INA's Burma Campaign. A segment of the Free India Legion fought against British and Polish Forces in Italy in 1944.|$|E
25|$|A {{second major}} {{educational}} issue which arose during Chavous' third term was {{another round of}} reform aimed at the D.C. Board of Education. On September 24, 2003, Mayor Williams announced that the city's public school system was so dysfunctional and provided such low-quality education that he was introducing legislation to strip the Board of nearly all its power. Control over the school system would {{be given to the}} mayor, who would have the right to hire and fire the superintendent, principals, teachers, and other workers and who would gain significant new powers to reconstitute programs, operations, curriculum, and schools. Although Chavous was working on his own bill to give the Council and mayor more power over the school system, he immediately threw his support behind Williams' plan. But little action on the mayor's plan had been taken by January 2004. Chavous argued that Williams had not been forceful enough in <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for his proposal, and journalist Craig Timberg linked Chavous' lack of activity on the measure to a reluctance to take on a controversial issue in an election year. (Chavous' own bill was also delayed, and he said it would not be ready until at least March 2004.) Williams said he might seek a third term as mayor merely to fight for his school reform bill, if the council did not act more expeditiously. In February 2004, Chavous announced he no longer supported the mayor's bill. The school district was without a superintendent, and Chavous argued that no individual would want the job if the council was considering such a significant change to the position. He also said that giving the mayor hiring and firing authority over the superintendent would require congressional approval or a voter referendum, and both processes would take too long. Chavous then introduced a bill which largely undid the 2000 reforms. The new bill provided for a nine-member board, with eight elected members (one from each ward) and a president elected citywide. Chavous' committee approved the bill in April 2004 without a hearing. Although Mayor Williams submitted an altered form of his original proposal two weeks after the defeat, it was rejected in mid-May and the Chavous bill approved by the council in July on a close 7-to-6 vote.|$|E
