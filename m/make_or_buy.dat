With respect to the first issue, they show that a company’s strategic capability changes the threshold at which an outsourcing decision is made. Due to the specific capabilities of some companies, the boundary between governance by the market and that of the hierarchy is changed. They suggest this as a way to seamlessly integrate the theories of Resource-based view and Transaction cost. For the second issue, they explore the competitive dynamic between companies {{and its impact on}} outsourcing decisions. Through a computer simulation of competing companies, they show that outsourcing implemented by a company influences the relative performance of other companies, thereby initiating a succession (a cascade) of outsourcing decisions.|$|E

50|$|Inventories have a {{significant}} effect on profits. A business that <b>makes</b> <b>or</b> <b>buys</b> goods to sell must keep track of inventories of goods under all accounting and income tax rules. An example illustrates why. Fred buys auto parts and resells them. In 2008, Fred buys $100 worth of parts. He sells parts for $80 that he bought for $30, and has $70 worth of parts left. In 2009, he sells the remainder of the parts for $180. If he keeps track of inventory, his profit in 2008 is $50, and his profit in 2009 is $110, or $160 in total. If he deducted all the costs in 2008, he would have a loss of $20 in 2008 and a profit of $180 in 2009. The total is the same, but the timing is much different. Most countries' accounting and income tax rules (if the country has an income tax) require the use of inventories for all businesses that regularly sell goods they have made or bought.|$|R

Scouts have to <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> their own uniforms although in Kabul {{some of the}} Ministry's budget is allocated to uniform manufacture. If one is not assigned a uniform the only remaining option is to visit the tailor. The national uniform is tan-colored. Boys wear a shirt and pants, girls wear a long shirt and baggy pants. For headwear, boys wear navy blue berets. Girls generally wear a headscarf chador sometimes with a beret. The neckerchief is blue with a yellow border. A leather Scout belt with a brass belt buckle completes the uniform. The total cost for these items is about 1800 Afghanis, or 36 US dollars; a huge sum when one considers $10 a good daily wage in Afghanistan. Although scouts may perform odd jobs to earn the money a few Afghanis at a time, in some areas uniforms are simply unaffordable. In these places troops substitute dress shirt and appropriate trousers or visit the bazaar to buy a paramilitary-style shirt and pants.|$|E

40|$|The {{decision}} to vertically integrate services and deliver care has both management and policy concerns for healthcare in the United States. The change in reimbursement, which was enacted with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, influenced {{the availability of}} post acute services for acute hospital inpatients. Prior to this change, post acute services were reimbursed based on cost similar to the pre DRG era of Medicare reimbursement. The change in payment {{had the potential to}} make discharging patients more difficult resulting in a prolonged length of stay without additional payment and at increased costs for hospitals. As a result of this change hospitals made arrangements to provide care for this population.

This <b>makes</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision is a focus of this study. Were hospital decisions different after the BBA, than before this legislation?This study utilizes Oliver Williamson 2 ̆ 7 s transaction cost economics theory as the framework for the study and is a replication of a prior study by Chiu (1995) The Williamsons theory is based on the proposition that three transaction dimensions determine the most efficient method of operation for a firm: uncertainty, frequency, and asset specificity. Depending on the 2 ̆ 2 market 2 ̆ 2, organizations may elect to arrange services through the spot market, contract for services, or vertically integrate the service. The study uses data from the American Hospital Association survey as well as the Area Resources files to determine if individual hospitals have made contract arrangements, vertically integrated, or relied on the spot market to provide skilled nursing services. Data is collected before and after the BBA and analyzed using multiple regression analysis and then subjected to significance testing. Sixteen hypotheses are tested that focus on the three dimensions of transaction cost theory. Findings support the importance of transaction frequency and asset specificity, while only weak support is offered for transaction uncertainty. The results differ from the Chiu study, which found strong support for uncertainty and weak support for frequency. This study is unique in that it examines data from two time periods surrounding a major reimbursement change in Medicare.

40|$|Cross-functional <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> {{decision}} {{processes are}} strategic decision processes. The {{outcome of a}} <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision affects competitive advantage, strategic development and leads to changes in internal and external relations. When {{trying to make a}} strategic decision concerning <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> there are several functions {{that will have to be}} included, since the decision requires input regarding both existing and future possibilities. Furthermore, the outcome of the decision will affect the organisation not only in the long-term but also in its day-to-day operations. These are all important reasons for designing and managing the cross-functional <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision process. Current research indicates that there is no one best way in which all organizations can reach <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decisions but that these processes need to be cross-functional. There is a need to understand the functional involvement with its differences and consequences in <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision processes. The purpose of this dissertation is to develop knowledge of design and management of cross-functional <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision processes. The main contribution of the literature used in this dissertation is to establish existing research in the field of cross-functional <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision processes. Several decision process models are outlined and their pros-and-cons are analysed. The research gaps found are the basis for three research questions that together lead to the development of knowledge regarding design and management of cross-functional <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision processes. Empirical data were collected from an in-depth, longitudinal case study and two shorter case studies. The cross-functional <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision process is an iterative process including at least five phases, from initiating an investigation to follow-up on the outcome. The process needs different depth of functional integration in the phases in order to be able to move forward efficiently. Therefore, the cross-functional integration is shifting in the five phases, making the process change in resources. The design of the cross-functional <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision process is shaped by at least eight characteristics. These characteristics are organizational position, time for development, complexity of products, designation of process owner, <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> strategy, production systems, customer relations and supplier relations. They shape the design by determining which functions should be involved, the extent of their involvement, which phases are needed, the number of options for <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy,</b> formality of the process, importance of the process, information flows and process time, thus due to the process being cross-functional there are consequences. The cross-functional <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision process has disadvantages with regards to several information flows, several functional strategies, power distribution and resource-consumption. However, the advantage is that a focused <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> strategy can be obtained, resources allocated correctly, and an up-to-date view of the internal and external environment...|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the dimensions along which <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision processes change over time. Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a longitudinal in-depth case study of a large industrial company, where the data were collected using interviews, documentation and observations. The data were analyzed using chronological patterns, and findings were then compared with the literature on <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision processes. Findings Nine dimensions were found along which the <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision process had changed over time. The dimensions were cross-functionality, structure, regularity, formality, awareness, mandatory, information distribution and management and flexibility. The causes of the changes were related to a combination of company internal and external events and contexts. Research limitations/implications The findings should be seen as a first attempt in assisting in the creation of a foundation for constructing more dynamic <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision process models. However, since the findings are based on a single case, they need to be complemented by more research in order to help determine how context sensitive the identified dimensions are.

Although outsourcing has allowed firms to concentrate on their core competencies, it has also shown several issues that prove it is not a panacea.
