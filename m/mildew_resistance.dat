40|$|Ramularia {{leaf spot}} (RLS) is widely present in Denmark {{nowadays}} {{and has the}} potential to reach severity levels high enough to cause economic damage. The results of multi-location surveys and field trials of several years suggest that varietal resistance can be an efficient means for controlling RLS. The spring barley cultivars most affected by RLS possess mlo-resistance against powdery mildew while the least affected ones do not. Other <b>mildew</b> <b>resistances</b> as well as varietal susceptibility to other foliar diseases were not clearly related to the RLS reaction pattern of neither spring- nor winter barley cultivars. Promising RLS resistance donors may be the spring barleys Power, Helium, Isabella, Nathalie, Cruiser and Isotta and the winter barleys Lonni, followed by Chess, Lomerit, Nobilia, and Carola. However, more work is needed to develop reliable methods for efficient RLS resistance testing and to determine the nature and genetic basis of RLS resistance and its relation to varietal resistances against other diseases...|$|R

40|$|Downy mildew {{disease is}} a major devastating disease caused by Sclerospora graminicola in pearl millet. Although disease {{management}} studies have indicated several biological as well as chemical control measures, the durability of resistance {{appears to be a}} major problem and has been attributed to the lack of understanding of pathogenic or resistance processes at molecular levels. Present study reveals the involvement of plasma membrane H+-ATPase in downy <b>mildew</b> disease <b>resistance</b> and offer H+-ATPase assay as a tool to evaluate downy <b>mildew</b> disease <b>resistance</b> in host cultivars resistant to all existing pathotypes, pathotypes 1 - 5. H+-ATPase was activated by fungal attack in all resistant cultivars but not in susceptible cultivars. The level of H+-ATPase was correlated with the degree of resistance as evaluated by field screening studies. Upregulation of H+-ATPase was specifically in the coleoptile region, which is the susceptible site for the attack by the downy mildew pathogen. The upregulated levels of H+-ATPase activity were also observed in resistant cell suspension and correlated with acidification of the extracellular medium. There was no change in either H+-ATPase activity or acidification in susceptible cell suspensions. Serological evidence for the upregulation of H+-ATPase activity only in resistant pearl millet has also been provided using a monoclonal antibody (MAb 46 E 5 B 11 F 6) against maize H+-ATPase by ELISA as well as immunoblot. A 100 -kDa band was specifically increased 3 -fold in the resistant cultivar. The results of the investigation suggest that plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity may be involved in the initial step of resistance to the downy mildew disease pathogen and the increase in activity could be due to activation by post translational modification as well as by upregulating the enzyme synthesis.

50|$|OPM {{tends to}} appear {{near the end}} of the growing season. The best way to control L. taurica is to remove all crop residue from the {{previous}} onion crop before subsequent planting. Two methods to accomplish this include deep tillage, and rotating to a non-host crop the year following an onion crop. Controlling volunteer onion sprouting (or the emergence of the previous year's onion plants) will also assist in prevention of the pathogen from carrying-over from one year to the next. Irrigation practices can also be used to limit the development of OPM. Moisture stress has been noted to increase the susceptibility of host species to L. taurica. Onions with adequate moisture will be more resistant to the pathogen, and onion crops with overhead irrigation rarely see powdery mildew development in the field. The fungicide Cabrio (produced by BASF Chemical) is labeled for the control of L. taurica on onions, but the disease rarely progresses enough to justify the use of a fungicide. Considerations of economic benefit should be made before the fungicide is applied, and all labeling directions followed. Resistant varieties have been found in some studies, Jahn et al. found powdery <b>mildew</b> <b>resistance</b> to be extremely beneficial in cucurbits, reducing the need for fungicide, and reducing agricultural losses due to powdery mildew pathogens. Although a truly resistant variety has not been found for onion plants, some onion genotypes with glossy leaves had selective susceptibility to L. taurica. Onions with the glossiest leaves were found to be most susceptible, while onions with less glossy leaves showed limited susceptibility. However, the study was unable to come to a conclusion on which variety was best suited for L. taurica resistance.|$|E
50|$|Bacillus licheniformis strain SB3086 {{has been}} {{identified}} as a biological control agent of mango anthracnose infection, and also shows some antagonistic effects toward powdery mildew infections when applied in combination with copper oxychloride. One current issue with the use of B. licheniformis as a control agent is that no reliable means has been developed for maintaining the bacterial population over the long term. The other major issue with the use of this species as a biopesticide is that it has been potentially identified as causing illnesses such as food poisoning in humans, as well as several other diseases in animals. It is currently approved in the United States by the Environmental Protection Agency for use in controlling fungal diseases on ornamental plants and turf, but cannot be applied to any crop intended for consumption by animals or humans. Ampelomyces quisqualis is another biological control agent, this being a fungus that is capable of parasitizing O. mangiferae. It was registered with the EPA as a biopesticide in 1994, used for powdery mildew control on various fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops. It has been deemed safe for use on crops intended for human and animal consumption, with no adverse side effects anticipated. It is marketed with the trade name “AQ10”, and is available in powder format. Several varieties of A. quisqualis that are resistant to commonly used fungicides are also available, so that regular fungicide applications may also be used in combination with the biopesticide. Pycnidia are produced within the mycelia and conidiophores of the powdery mildew, leading to reduced growth or colony death. The limitation of this parasite as a biocontrol agent is that it requires that some of the pathogen be present to act as a host for its growth. In plant species and cultivars with little or no powdery <b>mildew</b> <b>resistance,</b> the small amount of pathogen growth may cause an unacceptable amount of damage before A. quisqualis can control the fungus.|$|E
