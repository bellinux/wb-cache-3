40|$|Introduction. Physical {{activity}} {{is fundamental to}} children's all-round development {{in the first six}} years of their life. It is particularly significant in preschool age, when the need for movement is predominant. Psychomotor development, conditioned by children's innate abilities and their own activity, depends upon the influence of external surroundings as well as parental upbringing and preschool education. The aim {{of the study was to}} obtain data regarding physical activity (both structured and unstructured) of children during their stay in a kindergarten. Material and methods. The study was conducted in five state kindergartens situated in four main housing estates of Bia³a Podlaska. It included 11 groups of older preschool children. It was a diagnostic study. A diagnostic poll method employed in the study included interviews with teachers, lesson observations (during one day) and document analyses (programmes and class registers). Results. During their stay in a kindergarten children take part in physical activities for 1. 5 hours a day. During this period they participate in obligatory forms of physical activity such as <b>morning</b> <b>gymnastics,</b> movement plays, outdoor activities and gymnastic exercises. Furthermore, optional movement activities are organised in kindergartens (different forms in different kindergartens). Such extra classes enable children to be physically active for over two more hours per week. Conclusions. In terms of caring about health and motor development of children, not all elements of preschool education programmes are fully realised.

Луцьк) Lesya Ukrainka Eastern European National University (Lutsk) Анотації Однією із ключових проблем є зміна пояснювально-ілюстративного та репродуктивного видів навчання на інтенсивні технології. Така ситуація спонукає до пошуку нових, особистісно-зорієнтованих методик навчання фізичної культури студентів. Серед них центральне місце займає модульна система навчання. Основними положеннями, на яких побудована методика роботи за новою моделлю, є індивідуалізація засобів і методів навчання, підвищення обсягів та інтенсивності навчальних занять, акцентований розвиток рухових якостей і на їх основі – рухових умінь, навичок, інтересу до занять та, як наслідок, підвищення результативності педагогічного процесу Методика модульного навчання передбачає мету, завдання, принципи, засоби навчання (фізичні вправи, ігри, гігієнічні фактори, оздоровчі сили природи) навчання, методи навчання (чітко-регламентований, частково-регламентований, ігровий, змагальний, методи слова, наочні методи), форми навчання (навчальні заняття, ранкова гігієнічна гімнастика, самостійні заняття), результати навчальної діяльності, педагогічний контроль і корекцію навчального процесу. Ключові слова: студенти, модульне навчання, фізичне виховання, індивідуалізація. One of the key problems is change of explanatory-illustrative and reproductive kinds of studying with the intensive technologies. Such situation leads to searching of new, personally oriented methodologies of teaching of physical culture to students. The main principles, on which the methodology of work is built according to the new model, is individualization of means and methods of studying, increasing the amount and intensity of educational classes aimed at development of motor qualities and on their basis increasing of motor abilities, skills, interest to classes and, as a result, increasing of the effectiveness of the pedagogical process. Methodology of the module teaching foresees aim, objectives, principles, means of teaching (physical exercises, games, hygienic factors, recreational power of nature), teaching methods (precisely regulated, partially regulated, playing, competitive, verbal methods, visual methods), forms of studying (educational classes, <b>morning</b> hygienic <b>gymnastics,</b> individual trainings), results of educational activity, pedagogical control and correction of educational process. Key words: students, module teaching, physical education, individualization. Jednym z głównych problemów jest zmiana objaśniającego-ilustracyjnego i reprodukcyjnego typów edukacji na technologie intensywne. Sytuacja ta prowadzi do wyszukiwania nowych, indywidualnie zorientowanych metodyk nauczania kultury fizycznej studentów. Wśród nich centralne znaczenie ma modułowy system nauczania. Podstawowe zasady, na które opiera się metoda roboty według nowego modelu, jest indywidualizacja instrumentów i metod szkoleniowych, podniesienie objętości a intensywności zajęć, zaakcentowany rozwój zdolności motorycznych i na ich podstawie — zdolności, umiejętności motorycznych, zainteresowania do nauczania, i jako rezultat, zwiększenie skuteczności procesu edukacyjnego. Metodyka nauczania modułowego przewiduje cele, zadania, zasady, narzędzia edukacyjne (ćwiczenia fizyczne, gry, czynniki higieniczne, zdrowotne siły przyrody), metody nauczania (wyraźnie uregulowany, częściowo regulowany, zabawowy, rywalizujący, metody werbalne, metody wizualne), formy nauczania (sesje szkoleniowe, poranna gimnastyka higieniczna, zajęcia indywidualne), wyniki działalności edukacyjnej, kontrolę pedagogiczną a korygowanie procesu edukacyjnego.
