40|$|In {{manufacturing}} industry, {{variations in}} machinability are regularly observed when producing {{the same part}} out of different <b>material</b> <b>batches</b> of a case hardening steel. However, <b>material</b> <b>batches</b> showing a decreased machinability often have properties within the material specification. Thus, for an increased machinability and a more robust production of case hardening steel parts, the relationship between microstructure and machinability needs to be further investigated. In this study, machinability has been evaluated for a specific case hardening steel with respect to pearlite nodular size, phase distribution and interlamellar spacing of pearlite. These variations in microstructure have been achieved by altering the annealing cycle, i. e. austenitizing temperature, holding time and temperature for pearlite formation. The criterions for machinability which are taken into consideration in this investigation are tool wear and chip formation. Furthermore, a comparison of cutting forces and surface integrity for the tested microstructures will be presented. The results from tests show a difference between material with larger pearlite nodules and a material with smaller pearlite nodules. For tool wear, the material with larger pearlite nodules has a decreased machinability. However, for chip formation the result is opposite, and a material with larger pearlite nodules has an increased machinability...|$|E

Samples of two <b>material</b> <b>batches</b> were selected: one just stays near the upper limit of tolerance and the other has mean properties. Tensile and compression tests confirm the different mechanical behaviours and allow the identification of constitutive laws parameters. Optical metallography after T 3 and T 10 thermal treatments and differential thermal analysis provide the grain size and precipitation characteristics of each material batch, which explain their different mechanical behaviours. The industrial rod studied is usually forged in two operations: a first forging process, then a T 10 thermal treatment followed by a second forging step.

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} {{the analysis of the}} behaviour of artificial neural nets for prediction of raw <b>material</b> <b>batches</b> for the production of clinker. During the production several oxides that are present in raw materials in quarries have to be extracted for homogenization of the mixture suitable for clinker production. There is some delay between the measurement of the mixture and the material which is send from quarry. It is necessary to "send" precise chemical composition to ensure a good quality of clinker and resulting product-cement. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are suitable for such kind of time-independent prediction. The results show that not all oxides are necessary to use for the prediction of one oxide. The ANN were designed into several nets with one input similarly as pseudo neural networks are able to work. The results will be used for the purpose of further research of pseudo neural nets which currently serve only as classifiers. © ECMS Valen M.

40|$|Typical {{products}} made of {{case hardening steel}} are transmission parts like gear wheels, pinions and crown wheels. Case hardening produces a carbon-rich surface and provides the parts with both enhanced hardness and fatigue life. However, variations in machinability are regularly observed when producing the same part out of different <b>material</b> <b>batches.</b> This leads to a non-robust production process with increased manufacturing costs as well as unforeseen stops and maintenance of machines. In this study, emphasis is laid on studying the effect of microstructure variations on machinability in case hardening steels. Different microstructures have been produced by changing holding time and temperature in the annealing process. The microstructure was altered {{as much as possible}} with respect to pearlite nodular size, pearlite morphology and amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite. Since a homogeneous material is required, relatively small sample diameters had to be used. Therefore, the machinability ranking (with respect to tool wear) was performed with help of the Volvo Standard Machinability Test which is a short-term test. Additionally, chip breakability was evaluated and measurements of cutting forces and surface roughness were performed. The tests have shown that a case hardening steel with larger pearlite nodular size (produced by a higher austenitizing temperature) provides better chip breakability but also an increased tool wear compared to a material with smaller pearlite nodular size. Hence, to achieve a more robust production process for case hardening steels, it might be necessary to include pearlite nodular size and/or amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite in the materials specification. Moreover, the different tests have revealed that hardness is not a suitable criterion for machinability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{air bending}} process {{is one of}} the most widely used process for the {{manufacturing}} of sheet metal bending parts made of thin as well as of thick sheet metal. Although the air bending process offers a very high production potential due to its great flexibility, it is associated with certain problems which can negatively influence the shape and dimensional accuracy of the bending parts. Examples for such negative influences are the springback of the <b>material,</b> the <b>batch</b> variations, or the deflections of the bending machine and tools. These differences have to be considered either in the determination of the process parameters or they have to be compensated later on in the manufacturing process itself. A well established approach to calculate process data for forming processes is the use of a process simulation. At the Institute of Forming Technology and Lightweight Construction (IUL) a simulation software called Sheet Metal Bending Simulation (SMBS) has been developed and successfully been tested for the field of sheet metal bending, based on semi-analytical approaches. Although it already provides very satisfactory results in general, disturbances such as <b>material</b> and <b>batch</b> variations as well as the deflections of C-frame, machine table, and press brake ram can still negatively affect the prediction of the punch displacement necessary to achieve a certain bend angle.

The experiments have proved to introduce some improvements, however the occurrence of grinding burns have not been reduced or quantified and the cause of the grinding burn has not been identified or quantified. Grinding is a complex phenomenon and there are many variables that play a role in grinding burn and have to be studied as a complete system. This thesis aims at studying the cause of grinding burn in crankshaft systematically using World Class Manufacturing’s Advanced Kaizen methodology.

The mechanisms of the different stages of sulfate chemistry in the batch and sulfate fining process are presented, depending on the level of addition of cokes in the batch. The fining gas release as function of temperature from batch and melt are shown for different soda-lime-silica glass forming raw <b>material</b> <b>batches.</b> In case of coke and sulfate containing batches, sulfur dioxide gas release takes place in steps and at different temperature levels. SO 2 may evolve from the batch blanket (at about 900 Â°C), but also at higher temperatures from the fresh melt starting at about 1050 Â°C up to 1250 Â°C, some SO 2 release can take place up to 1350 Â°C and then for oxidized melts a strong evolution between 1420 and 1500 Â°C. The last stage of SO 2 evolution from the melt is generally accompanied with oxygen gas formation as well. Bubble growth rates during primary fining a float glass melts from experiments and models are compared and the removal of dissolved gases from such melts will be shown.

40|$|The nuclear {{materials}} safeguards {{system of the}} International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna consists of two parts: the verification of the material flow and inventory data reported by the operator of a nuclear plant; {{the establishment of a}} material balance {{at the end of an}} inventory period with the help of the operator's reported data, which means that the book inventory (initial physical inventory plus receipts minus shipments) is compared with the ending physical inventory. By definition it is necessary that the plant operator maintains a complete measurement system for all {{nuclear materials}} processed in the plant. In this paper, we consider an alternative inspection scheme which is based on material accountability too, but which does not make use of the data reported by the operator. Contrary to the IAEA safeguards system, the material balance in this system is closed only with the help of the data observed by the inspection team itself. Such a system could be important in situations where there is no reason for a plant operator to maintain a complicated measurement system, or where, for some reason, the records are not available. It is clear that if the inspection team cannot measure the data of all <b>material</b> <b>batches</b> processed in the plant under consideration (e. g. if the inspection budget or time is limited), then some prior information about the average material contents of the different batches as well as the batch-to-batch variation have to be used. Therefore, a Bayesian approach seems to be natural for the treatment of problems of this kind. On the other hand, this prior information will not be very detailed, and so we will use the principles of credibility theory where only the first two moments of the prior distribution have to be known. In this paper, we first consider only one class of material, and then R different classes (inputs, outputs, etc.) with the problem of material balance closure. Finally we discuss the problem of optimization of a given inspection effort. As the batch-to-batch variation of the true material contents within one class normally is much larger than the measurement variance, we will neglect the measurement errors here; they could easily be taken into account, if necessary...|$|E
40|$|Mould steels {{are mainly}} {{employed}} in moulding of plastic products, {{and also some}} metals with low melting temperature such as magnesium alloys. The ever-growing usage of plastics in the industry, especially the automotive industry, and in everyday life, has increased the utilization of mould steels. Of all properties of these steels, machinability has the highest practical and economic importance as it covers over 60 % {{of the cost of}} the mould making process. Due to the more practical efficiency and shorter lead time, the use of the mould steels in prehardened condition has become more popular over traditional rough machining in the soft annealed state followed by post-roughening hardening and final machining. The present study is concerned with the influence of microstructure on the machinability of prehardened mould steels at a hardness level of around 40 HRC. The studied materials were some popular commercial mould steels and the experimental methods were chosen with consideration to industrial practices and demands. Also, the comparison of machinability and other properties was conducted at identical hardness, with the help of proper heat treatments and <b>material</b> <b>batches.</b> In addition to machinability, the mechanical properties of the studied materials were examined as well. Screening of 10 different plastic mould steels in machinability tests, two milling and two drilling, showed a considerable difference when ranking the machinability of the materials. The precipitation hardened steels exhibited a higher drillability than the quenched and tempered steels. The machinability of Uddeholm Impax HH (a modified AISI P 20) and Uddeholm Nimax, hardened to a similar hardness with and without heat treatment, respectively, was compared with respect to tool life, cutting force and cutting temperature. Uddeholm Nimax showed a better machinability, with a longer tool life and lower cutting force although its cutting temperature was a little higher, beside superior mechanical properties. Furthermore, the effect of some microstructural features, e. g. martensite packet size, carbide morphology and retained austenite, on the machinability was examined in Uddeholm Impax HH. The results showed an improved machinability with longer tool life and a somewhat lower cutting force in the steel variant with smaller martensite packet size.

The potential of clay containing 1 or 3 or 5 % SSA was assessed {{for use as a}} landfill liner-soil <b>material.</b> <b>Batch</b> adsorption, low temperature N 2 adsorption, and TG-DTA tests were performed to evaluate the adsorption capacity, micropore structure, thermostability, and components of soils under Cr(VI) and Pb(II) chemical solutions. With the increasing amount of SSA in modified clay, the adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) and Pb(II) to the modified clay increases gradually. After absorption, the pore size of modified clay ranges from 2 [*]nm to 8 [*]nm. With the increasing amount of absorption, the pore volume decreases and the specific surface area increases. With the increasing of adsorption concentration of Cr(VI) and Pb(II), the mass loss percentage of modified clay increases to 23. 4 % and 12. 6 %, respectively. The modified clay containing SSA may be used as a good barrier material to attenuate contamination of Cr(VI) and Pb(II) in landfills...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the removal of dissolved arsenite (As(III)) using a 100 - mesh zero valent iron (Fe??) material with millimeter in batch reactions. Several experiments were performed {{using a variety of}} techniques for both liquid and solid phase analysis. The objective was to carry out a basic, a systematic investigation of the reaction of As(III) with a well-characterized Fe?? material with a low surface area compared with nanometer-scale <b>materials.</b> <b>Batch</b> reactions and flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) revealed that the initial rate of As(III) uptake (removal) was a slow process compared with smaller Fe?? particle materials. Total As(III) removal reached a maximum at 14. 84 mg/g. Solid phase analysis of the products by X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed magnetite (Fe 3 0 4). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed needle-like surface structures due to magnetite. The removal of dissolved As(III) and the surface reactivity of Fe?? are closely dependent on the total As(III) concentration. Therefore a complete understanding of As(III) contaminant removal will require measurement and monitoring...|$|R
40|$|The average in-situ {{strength}} of a member, expressed as the {{strength of}} an equivalent compression test result, will be lass than of a standard cast specimen of the same concrete, which has been properly compacted and moist-cured for 28 days. The extend of the difference will depend on construction techniques, but general patterns can be defined according to member type. Variations in concrete supply will be {{due to differences in}} <b>materials,</b> <b>batching,</b> transport and handling techniques. These will reflect the degree of control over production and will normally be indicated by control and compliance test specimens in which other factors are all standardized. The present paper analyses the effectiveness of the rebound test and ultrasonic pulse velocity in evaluating the strength variability of concrete structural elements, expressed by: confidence interval,, colours “contour ” plots showing areas of equal strength and ANOVA technique. The paper also shows criterion for concrete variability analysis. However, test results, is still small, and these criteria should not be used at random...|$|R
