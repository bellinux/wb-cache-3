40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the potential for protecting critical <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal</b> habitat on private lands bordering the south-western edge of the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, Costa Rica. First, a habitat analysis was made of 12 forest patches using a 10 % strip method to obtain an importance value for the Lauraceae fed on by the <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal.</b> Second, a landowner survey was conducted using a structured interview questionnaire to determine landowner attitudes, and the possible factors influencing these attitudes, towards forested land, wildlife, the <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal</b> and potential habitat protection incentives. Significant differences were found between forest patch importance values for the Lauraceae suggesting that for conservation purposes careful forest patch selection is important. Most landowners were found to value their forested land more than their land under other uses and to favor technical forest management assistance over leasing. If funding can be made available there is a good chance that <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal</b> habitat can be adequately protected and managed through providing assistance to those landowners with the most critical forest patches.

50|$|The <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal,</b> a trogon with a {{stunning}} physical appearance, {{can also be}} found in parts of Costa Rica. The bird's long grey and black tail feathers can stretch up to a meter long and are its defining feature. <b>Resplendent</b> <b>quetzals</b> live in cloud forests and are most active in the canopy. They can be found in several of Costa Rica's parks and reserves, including the Monteverde Cloud Forest, Santa Elena Cloud Forest Reserve, Braulio Carrillo National Park, Poas Volcano National Park, Chirripo National Park, and the Juan Castro Blanco National Park. <b>Resplendent</b> <b>quetzals</b> eat fruit, insects, small frogs, lizards, and snails and have distinctive echoing calls. Unfortunately, the bird is endangered because its cloud forest habitat has been widely destroyed across Central America.|$|R

50|$|<b>Resplendent</b> <b>quetzals</b> usually {{live alone}} when not breeding. They are monogamous {{territorial}} breeders, {{with the territory}} size being measured in Guatemala as 6 - 10 ha. They are also seasonal breeders, with the breeding season being March to April in Mexico, May to June in El Salvador and March to May in Guatemala. When breeding, females lay two pale blue eggs in a nest placed in a hole which they carve in a rotten tree. A tree in the required stage of decomposition is susceptible to weather damage, {{and the availability of}} suitable trees may limit the <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal</b> population.|$|R
50|$|The reserve has 885 species, about 70% of {{all species}} found in Guatemala and Belize, {{including}} threatened birds like the <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal</b> (Pharomachrus mocinno), harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and horned guan (Oreophasis derbianus).|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "song" [...] is a treble {{syllable}} {{described as}} kyow or like [...] "a whimpering pup", often in pairs, {{which may be}} repeated monotonously. <b>Resplendent</b> <b>quetzals</b> have other unmusical calls as well.|$|R

50|$|<b>Resplendent</b> <b>quetzals</b> are {{considered}} specialized fruit-eaters, although they mix their diet with insects (notably wasps, ants, and larvae), frogs and lizards. Particularly important are wild avocados and other {{fruit of the}} laurel family, which the birds swallow whole before regurgitating the pits, which helps to disperse these trees.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in various types of Mesoamerican mythology.

It is {{well-known}} for its colorful plumage. There are two subspecies, P. m. mocinno and P. m. costaricensis.|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "quetzal" [...] was {{originally}} used {{for just the}} <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal,</b> the long-tailed quetzal of southern Mexico and Central America, which is the national bird {{and the name of}} the currency of Guatemala. It still often refers to that bird specifically but now also names all the species of the genera Pharomachrus and Euptilotis.|$|R
5000|$|Ryan Paul, {{writing for}} Ars Technica, said in April 2012 when {{the name was}} {{announced}} [...] "A Quetzal is a colorful bird that is common to Central America. The most well-known variety, the <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal,</b> {{is known for its}} beauty. The name is a good fit for Ubuntu, which aims to soar in the cloud, offer visual appeal without compromising function, and avoid smacking into closed windows." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 572 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} including migrant toucan (Ramphastos genus), Amazon parrot (Amazona genus), and macaw (Ara genus). Resident birds included tanagers (Tangara and Tachyphonus genera), woodcreepers (Xiphorhynchus genus), <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal</b> (Pharomachrus mocinno), 15 species of curassows (Crax, Nothocrax, Mitu and Pauxi genera), and tinamous (Crypturellus and Tinamus genera).Endangered birds include wattled curassow (Crax globulosa), green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster) and red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus).|$|R
50|$|The <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal</b> (Pharomachrus mocinno) moves {{seasonally}} {{from high}} elevation nesting sites to lower elevations {{on both sides}} of the Continental Divide. The beginning of the migration of the three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculata) is similar to that of the quetzal, with reproduction occurring close to the Continental Divide, from March to June, and followed by a post-reproductive move downhill on the Pacific slope during the months of August and September.|$|R
5000|$|The word quetzal {{comes from}} the Nahuatl (or Aztec) word quetzalli (from the root quetz meaning [...] "stand"), which {{translates}} to [...] "long green plume" [...] or [...] "tail feather of the quetzal". Quetzal is usually specifically {{used to refer to}} the <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal</b> (Pharomachrus mocinno) first described by Pablo de la Llave in 1832 but in reality it applies to all members of the genera Pharomachrus and Euptilotis.|$|R
