40|$|Selenium and seleno {{dependent}} {{glutathione peroxidase}} (GPX) deficiency {{has been described}} in endemias of myxedematous cretinism. In northern Zaire, a selenium supplementation trial has been conducted. Beside correcting the GPX activity, two months of selenium supplementation was shown to modify the serum thyroid hormones parameters in clinically euthyroid subjects and to induce a dramatic fall of the already impaired thyroid function in clinically hypothyroid subjects. These results further support a role of selenium in thyroid hormone metabolism. In an iodine deficient area, this selenium deficiency could lead to opposite clinical consequences: protect the general population and the fetus against iodine deficiency and brain damage; and in turn, favour the degenerative process of the thyroid gland leading to <b>myxoedematous</b> <b>cretinism.</b> Case ReportsJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|Free {{radical damage}} and {{fibrosis}} caused by selenium deficiency {{are thought to}} be involved in the pathogenesis of <b>myxoedematous</b> <b>cretinism.</b> So far, no pathway explains the link between selenium deficiency and tissue fibrosis. Pharmacological doses of iodine induce necrosis in iodine-deficient thyroids. Necrosis is much increased if the glands are also selenium-deficient, which then evolve to fibrosis. This rat model was reproduced to explore the role of selenium deficiency in defective tissue repair. At first, proliferation indexes of epithelial cells and fibroblasts were comparable between selenium-deficient and control groups. Then, in selenium-deficient thyroids the inflammatory reaction was more marked being mainly composed of macrophages. The proliferation index of the epithelial cells decreased, while that of the fibroblasts increased. These thyroids evolved to fibrosis. TGF-beta immunostaining was prominent in the macrophages of selenium-deficient rats. Anti TGF-beta antibodies restored the proliferation indexes, and blocked the evolution to fibrosis. In selenium deficiency, an active fibrotic process occurs in the thyroid, in which the inflammatory reaction and an excess of TGF-beta play a key role. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|Thyroid {{destruction}} {{leading to}} endemic <b>myxoedematous</b> <b>cretinism</b> is highly prevalent in central Africa, where iodine (I) and selenium (SE) deficiencies {{as well as}} thiocyanate (SCN) overload are combined. All three factors have been studied experimentally in the etiology of the disease, but {{they have never been}} studied in combination. In a model using rats, we have previously shown that combining I and SE deficiencies increases the sensitivity of the thyroid to necrosis after iodide overload, an event unlikely to occur in the African situation. To develop a model that would more closely fit with the epidemiological findings, we have determined whether an SCN overload would also result in thyroid necrosis as does the I overload. The combination of the three factors increased by 3. 5 times the amount of necrotic cells, from 5. 5 +/- 0. 3 % in the I-SE+ thyroids to 18. 9 +/- 1. 6 % in the I-SE-SCN-overloaded ones. Methimazole administration prevented the SCN-induced necrosis. SE- thyroids evolved to fibrosis, whereas SE+ thyroids did not. TGFbeta was prominent in macrophages present in SE- glands. Thyroid destruction in central Africa might therefore originate from the interaction of three factors: I and SE deficiencies by increasing H(2) O(2) accumulation, SE deficiency by decreasing cell defense and promoting fibrosis, and SCN overload by triggering follicular cell necrosis.

40|$|<b>Myxoedematous</b> endemic <b>cretinism</b> is {{prevalent}} in African goitre endemies. It has {{been related to}} a thyroid 'exhaustion' atrophy occurring near birth. It is proposed that this might result from the low resistance of a fragile tissue to enhanced H 2 O 2 generation under intense thyroid stimulation by thyrotropin. In support of this hypothesis, low selenium and glutathione peroxidase serum levels {{have been found in}} the African endemic area of the Idjwi Island (Kivu, Zaire). Serum selenium and plasma glutathione peroxidase were lower in the area of high endemicity of goitre and cretinism (Northern part of the Island). However, only the former difference is statistically significant. These data thus suggest a role of oligoelements and oxygen toxicity in the pathogenesis of endemic cretinism.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Severe {{selenium}} deficiency {{has been documented}} in northern Za√Øre, already {{known as one of}} the most iodine deficient regions in the world and characterized by a predominance of the <b>myxoedematous</b> form of <b>cretinism.</b> This has been attributed to the double deficiency of essential trace elements. A short selenium supplementation programme was conducted in this area to evaluate the effects of a selenium supplementation on thyroid diseases. DESIGN: Placebo or selenium 50 micrograms as selenomethionine was administered once daily for 2 months. Blood and urine samples were collected before and after supplementation. PATIENTS: Fifty-two healthy schoolchildren from northern Zaire. MEASUREMENT: Selenium status, thyroid function and urinary iodide were determined. RESULTS: After 2 months of selenium supplementation, mean +/- SD serum T 4 decreased from 73. 1 +/- 45. 4 to 48. 3 +/- 23. 7 nmol/l (P less than 0. 001), serum FT 4 from 11. 8 +/- 6. 7 to 8. 4 +/- 4. 1 pmol/l (P less than 0. 01), and serum rT 3 from 124 +/- 115 to 90 +/- 72 pmol/l (P less than 0. 05), without significant change in serum T 3 and serum TSH. CONCLUSION: Deiodinase type I which has been shown to be a seleno-enzyme could account for the changes in thyroid hormones in our subjects. Our data show that selenium plays a definite role in thyroid hormone metabolism in humans. Selenium could be an important cofactor in the clinical picture of iodine deficiency in Central Africa and could be involved in the aetiology of both forms of cretinism.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that selenium deficiency is a co-factor to iodine deficiency in the pathogenesis of <b>myxoedematous</b> <b>cretinism.</b> The mechanism proposed is that the generation of hydrogen peroxide is greatly increased in iodine-deficient thyroid glands, and that selenium is involved in the control of hydrogen peroxide and its derived free radicals. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of the possibly impaired cellular defence mechanism associated with selenium deficiency on thyroid necrosis and tissue repair. For this purpose, we studied thyroid tissue from selenium- (SE-) and/or iodine-deficient (I-) rats before and after an acute toxic iodine overload. In I- thyroids, necrotic cells were numerous. Acute iodine administration increased this effect. Necrosis was associated with transient infiltration of inflammatory cells. In I-SE+ thyroids the tissue resumed its normal appearance. In I-SE- thyroid glands, the iodide toxicity was stronger, with greater necrosis and inflammatory reaction. The inflammation resolved but was replaced by fibrotic tissue. Fifteen days after the toxic overload, the connective tissue volume was twice the control value. Before iodide overload, the proportion of dividing cells was equal in I-SE+ and I-SE- thyroids. Three days after the iodide overload, this proportion was increased in I-SE+ thyroids but reduced in the I-SE- thyroids. Overall, the I-SE- thyroids had four times fewer dividing cells than the I-SE+ thyroids. In summary, selenium deficiency coupled to iodine deficiency increased necrosis, induced fibrosis and impeded compensatory epithelial cell proliferation. These results are compatible with histological and functional description of thyroid tissue from myxoedematous cretins. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|In 1895, iodine was {{characterized}} {{as an essential}} element of thyroid tissue by Baumann. The efficacy of iodine to prevent goiter was demonstrated by Marine in Northern USA in 1916 - 1920. Severe endemic goiter and cretinism had been almost entirely eliminated from continental Western Europe and Northern America before the 1930 's; however large populations elsewhere and even some places in Western Europe (Sicily) were still affected up to the 2000 's. Public health consequences of iodine deficiency are not limited to endemic goiter and cretinism. Iodine deficiency disorders include also increased neonatal death rate and decreased intellectual development, although these consequences are not included in the current estimation of the Global Burden Disease related to iodine deficiency. Severe iodine deficiency as a public health problem is now largely under control worldwide, but can still affect isolated places, in hard-To-reach and/or politically neglected populations. We emphasize the importance of maintaining international cooperation efforts, in order to monitor iodine status where iodine deficiency is now adequately controlled, and identify at-risk population where it is not. The goal should be now global eradication of severe iodine deficiency. Commercial distribution of iodized salt remains the most appropriate strategy. A randomized clinical trial in New Guinea clearly showed in the 1970 's that correcting severe iodine deficiency early in pregnancy prevents endemic neurological cretinism. This supports the essential role of thyroid hormones of maternal origin on the normal fetal development, during the first trimester of pregnancy (i. e. when fetal thyroid is still not functional). A randomized clinical trial in Congo (RD) in the 1970 's also showed that correcting severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy prevents <b>myxoedematous</b> <b>cretinism,</b> particularly prevalent in affected Congolese areas.

40|$|Requests for oVprints {{should be}} {{addressed}} to J R Arthur) Selenium deficiency causes further impairment of thyroid hormone metabolism in iodine-deficient rats and therefore could have a role in the aetiology of both myxoedematous and neurological cretinism in humans. Thyroidal type I iodothyronine deiodinase (ID-I), cytosolic glutathione peroxidase and phos-pholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase ac-tivities were increased in iodine-deficient adult rats and their oVspring at 11 days of age. Thyroidal ID-I activity was unchanged and thyroidal cytosolic glutathione peroxidase activity was decreased by more than 75 % by combined selenium and iodine deficiency in 11 -day-old rats, indicating that, while the thyroid retained an ability to produce 3, 3 *, 5 -tri-iodothyronine (T 3), the gland was probably more susceptible to peroxidative damage caused by increased hydrogen peroxide concentrations driven by increased thyrotrophin. Thyroidal atrophy, common in <b>myxoedematous</b> <b>cretinism,</b> did not occur in iodine- or selenium and iodine-deficient rat pups. Iodine deficiency increased brain type II iodothyronine deiodinase activity 1 ¬∑ 5 -fold in 4 -day-old rats and 3 -fold in 11 -day-old rats, regardless of selenium status. Thus rats were able to activate compensatory mechanisms in brain that would maintain T 3 concentrations in selenium and iodine deficiencies. Surprisingly, however, selenium de-ficiency had a greater eVect than iodine deficiency on markers of brain development in rat pups. Expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA was decreased in selenium de-ficiency in 4 - and 11 -day-old pups and in combined selenium and iodine deficiency in 4 -day-old pups. Iodine deficiency caused an increase in BDNF expression in 11 -day-old pups but had no eVect on 4 -day-old pups. Myelin basic protein mRNA expression in brain was decreased by combined selenium and iodine deficiency in 11 -day-old rats...|$|E
40|$|In Central Africa, all of {{northern}} Zaire is very severely deficient in iodine. A peculiar {{feature of this}} endemia is that iodine deficiency and the ensuing thyroid gland stimulation not only leads to goitre formation but also to progressive thyroid involution and to <b>myxoedematous</b> <b>cretinism.</b> An iodine supplementation trial based on oral administration of small doses of iodine was made in 81 schoolchildren. All of them received a small dose of iodine (0. 1 ml containing 48 mg) per os and the thyroid status was followed during 4 months. Blood and urine samples were collected {{at the start of}} the study, then 2 weeks, 2 months and 4 months after iodine administration. Before iodine supplementation the mean urinary iodine level was 0. 18 +/- 0. 02 micromol/l, and 10 % of the subjects had a urinary iodine level below 0. 08 micromol/l. Fifty-two percent of the subjects had a serum thyrotropin (TSH) level above 10 mU/l. All the subjects responded to the administration of iodine. and all of them recovered a euthyroid status. Most of them were still euthyroid at the end of the study. However. within 4 or even 2 months, some subjects (15 % of the total) reverted to hypothyroidism. At the entry of the study these subjects were all hypothyroid and had elevated TSH and paradoxically low serum thyroglobulin (TG) values. In myxoedematous cretins living in the same area, even lower serum TG levels were found. Together with the absence of goitre, a paradoxically low serum TG Suggests a low thyroid reserve, and in the present case a reduced amount of functional thyroid tissue. We show that the serum TG/TSH ratio may be used as a predictive index of thyroid reserve and of positive response to iodine administration. These data further suggest that thyroid damage is not confined to myxoedematous cretins. but is widely distributed in the phenotypically normal population. Widely distributed thyroid damage may render iodine prophylaxis based on oral administration unpredictable. Clinical TrialComparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.
