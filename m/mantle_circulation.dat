[...] A deep, low-velocity anomaly under the uplifted region can be seen in tomographic surveys [...] and has been interpreted as a low-density anomaly coming from the deepest region of the mantle. [...] By predicting the region’s topographic response to the low-density anomaly using dynamic topography calculations, an almost perfect model of the elevated topography of the superswell is achieved.

This is the most common theory on flow within the mantle, although opposing theories do exist (6).

40|$|<b>Mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> {{models are}} a {{modified}} class of mantle convection simulations assimilating recent plate motions as the surface velocity boundary condition. In this thesis, I present {{a suite of}} <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> models assimilating the past 300 million years of tectonic history. By comparing model predictions of present day mantle temperature anomalies to mantle structure imaged by seismic tomography one can better understand the physical properties of Earth’s mantle. Given a mantle model with realistic physical properties, plate reconstructions can also be tested. Mantle viscosity {{is the most significant}} property affecting <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> models. For subducted slabs to sink to depths predicted by tomography studies a lower mantle viscosity increase of around thirty times is required. For models with a factor of ten increase slabs do not remain at mid-mantle depths for long enough, while a factor of one hundred increase causes slab sinking rates too slow to match imaged tomographic anomalies. An endothermic phase changes could potentially layer mantle convection into two independent layers. In models assimilating plate motions, no model containing an endothermic phase change reaches a fully layered state, even with unrealistically large, negative Clapeyron slopes. The onset of plate tectonics could potentially break down a two-layered mantle into a partially layered state, similar to the present day mantle. Predictions of mantle heterogeneity from high-resolution, global <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> models match well with complex mantle structure imaged by seismic tomography in the Tethys region. These models indicate that a more complicated history of subduction during the closure of the Neotethys Ocean is required to match the imaged mantle structure. Subduction is required in two locations, one at the Eurasian margin and a second behind a back-arc ocean opening in the Neotethys Ocean. Simultaneous subduction at both plate boundaries appears not to be necessary. Global <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> models estimate long-wavelength dynamic topography with amplitudes of up to five kilometres. The largest amplitude signal of dynamic topography is at plate boundaries, suggesting that near surface density variations in the mantle contribute significantly to the dynamic topography signal. The five-kilometre amplitude of topography is larger than predicted elsewhere and is explained by the inclusion of near surface density variations, commonly ignored by other global calculations of dynamic topography. If dynamic topography is defined as ‘any topography arising from flow within Earth’s mantle’ then near surface density variations are significant to the dynamic signal. Predictions of dynamic topography from <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> models reveal a dichotomy between continental and oceanic regions. Oceanic crust {{is a part of the}} mantle convection system and so predicted topography for ocean regions matches well with the expected depth versus age curve for oceanic crust. Continental regions are significantly subsided relative to oceans in the dynamic signal, suggesting that isostatic effects mask continental dynamic topography. When predictions of dynamic topography are corrected for isostatic effects and crustal thickness, an accurate estimate of Earth’s observed topography is generated. This work contributes to an on going debate on the nature of dynamic topography on global and regional scales...|$|E
40|$|Despite its importance, the {{temporal}} and spatial evolution of continental dynamic topography is poorly known. Australia's isolation from active plate boundaries and its rapid northward motion within a hot spot reference frame make it a useful place to investigate the interplay between mantle convection, topography, and drainage. Offshore, dynamic topography is relatively well constrained and can {{be accounted for by}} Australia's translation over the <b>mantle's</b> convective <b>circulation.</b> To build a database of onshore constraints, we have analyzed an inventory of longitudinal river profiles, which is sensitive to uplift rate history. Using independently constrained erosional parameters, we determine uplift rates by minimizing the misfit between observed and calculated river profiles. Resultant fits are excellent and calculated uplift histories match independent geologic constraints. We infer that western and central Australia underwent regional uplift during the last 50 Myr and that the Eastern Highlands have been uplifted in two stages. The first stage from 120 to 80 Ma, coincided with rifting along the eastern margin and its existence is supported by thermochronological measurements. A second stage occurred at 80 – 10 Ma, formed the Great Escarpment, and coincided with Cenozoic volcanism. The relationship between topography, gravity anomalies, and shear wave tomographic models suggest that regional elevation is supported by temperature anomalies within the lithosphere's thermal boundary layer.

40|$|Convective {{circulation}} of the Earth's mantle maintains some fraction of surface topography that varies with space and time. Most predictive models {{show that this}} dynamic topography has peak amplitudes of about ± 2 km, dominated by wavelengths of 10 $^ 4 $ km. Here, we test these models against our comprehensive observational database of 2, 120 spot measurements of dynamic topography that were determined by analysing oceanic seismic surveys. These accurate measurements have typical peak amplitudes of ± 1 km and wavelengths of approximately 10 $^ 3 $ km, and are combined with limited continental constraints to generate a global spherical harmonic model, the robustness {{of which has been}} carefully tested and benchmarked. Our power spectral analysis reveals significant discrepancies between observed and predicted dynamic topography. At longer wavelengths (such as 10 $^ 4 $ km), observed dynamic topography has peak amplitudes of about ± 500 m. At shorter wavelengths (such as 10 $^ 3 $ km), significant dynamic topography is still observed. We show that these discrepancies can be explained if short-wavelength dynamic topography is generated by temperature-driven density anomalies within a sub-plate asthenospheric channel.

40|$|The {{formation}} of new ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges {{is a fundamental}} component of the plate tectonic cycle and involves substantial transfer of heat and mass from the <b>mantle.</b> Hydrothermal <b>circulation</b> at mid-ocean ridges is critical for the advection of latent and sensible heat from the lower crust to enable the solidification of ocean crust near to the ridge axis. The sheeted dike complex (SDC) is the critical region between the eruptive lavas and the gabbros through which seawater-derived recharge fluids must transit to exchange heat with the magma chambers that form the lower ocean crust. ODP Hole 1256 D in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean provides the only continuous sampling of in-situ intact upper ocean crust formed at a fast spreading rate, through the SDC into the dike-gabbro transition zone. Here we exploit a high sample density profile of the Sr-isotopic composition of Hole 1256 D to quantify the time-integrated hydrothermal recharge fluid flux through the SDC. Assuming kinetically limited fluid-rock Sr exchange, a fluid flux of 1. 5 - 3. 2 x 106 kgm- 2 34 is required to produce the observed Sr-isotopic shifts. Despite {{significant differences in the}} distribution and intensity of hydrothermal alteration and fluid/rock Sr-isotopic exchange between Hole 1256 D and SDC sampled in other oceanic environments (ODP Hole 504 B, Hess Deep and Pito Deep), the estimated recharge fluid flux at all sites are similar, suggesting that the heat flux extracted by the upper crustal axial hydrothermal system is relatively uniform at intermediate to fast spreading rates. The hydrothermal heat flux removed by fluid flow through the SDCs, is sufficient to remove only ~ 20 to 60 % of the available latent and sensible heat from the lower crust. Consequently, there must be additional thermal and chemical fluid-rock exchange deeper in the crust, at least of comparable size to the upper crustal hydrothermal system. Two scenarios are proposed for the potential geometry of this deeper hydrothermal system. The first requires the downward expansion of the upper crustal hydrothermal system ~ 800 m into the lower crust in response to a downward migrating conductive boundary layer. The second scenario invokes a separate hydrothermal system in the lower crust for which fluid recharge bypasses reaction with the sheeted dikes, perhaps via flow down fault...|$|R

40|$|Tectonic Setting Overview Within {{this work}} the sediments (both {{detrital}} and chemical) and igneous rocks of the South Portuguese Zone {{are considered to}} have been deposited within a continental rift zone. This rift zone was linked to northwards (present day directions) subduction of the Palaeotethys oceanic plate under the continental Ossa Morena Zone plate. Within this setting the South Portuguese Zone {{is located on the}} northern margin of the Gondwana Plate and the Ossa Morena Zone on the southern margin of the Armorican plate. Crustal thinning and rifting developed due to stresses within the trailing plate. This allowed upward doming of the mantle under the area of thinning (passive rifting), and with time rifting became active and no longer required the force from subduction to exist. As a result of this morphology, two discrete basins were present in the Middle Devonian to Lower Carboniferous times, i. e. a continental rifted basin to the south and an oceanic basin to the north. Puio Do Lobo Domain Sediments of the Pulo do Lobo Domain were deposited as melanges within the northern oceanic basin. Two main groups are recognised within the Domain: the Ferreira-Ficalho Group {{to the north of the}} basin and the. Changa Group to the south. The Peramora Melange Formation, at the base of the Ferreira-Ficalho Group is interpreted as a tectonic melange produced by off-scraping of material from the subducting oceanic slab and from the overriding continental wedge. The remaining formations constituting the domain are classified as sedimentary melanges. Geochemistry indicates that sediments of the Changa Group and the Ferreira-Ficalho Group are broadly similar, with some minor differences. These differences coupled with the spatial arrangement of the groups suggest that each group derived from a discrete provenance. It is proposed that Changa Group sediments are products of erosion of the continental flank on the southern margin of the oceanic basin, i. e. the Gondwana Plate. Ferreira-Ficalho Group sediments derive from erosion of the northern Armorican flank. The variation in provenance signature along strike in the Ferreira-Ficalho Group suggests that the Armorican source area was not chemically homogenous. Eventual closure of the basin produced the present day imbricated arrangement of the Ferreira-Ficalho Group and Changa Group. In Spain, sedimentary formations superseding the Pulo do Lobo Formation are partially derived from a mafic/basaltic source and this source is the Beja- Acebuches Amphibolite. Average model ages for each Ferreira-Ficalho Group formation range from 1204 Ma in the Pulo do Lobo Formation to 885 Ma in the Horta da Torre Formation. The effects of incorporation of younger Beja-Acebuches Amphibolite material also decreases up succession. Thus, it is concluded that the Ferreira- Ficalho Group derives from an overturned sedimentary succession. The model age of the Peramora Melange Formation is 649 Ma, which is slightly older than the average for the Beja-Acebuches Amphibolite (424 Ma). This supports the mixing of relatively young oceanic material with older crustal material during Peramora Melange Formation generation. Beja-Acebuches Amphibolite The spatial arrangement of Beja-Acebuches Amphibolite lithologies coupled with the average model age (424 Ma) and the average sNd value (+ 9. 43) preclude any other origin, other than that of an obducted portion of the oceanic crust, which was subducting to the north during the closure of the Palaeotethys. Obduction occurred in a northerly direction, between the deposition of the Pulo do Lobo Formation and the Ribeira de Limas Formation (of the Ferreira-Ficalho Group). This places a Middle Devonian age on obduction (based on the palynological evidence of previous workers). Geochemical data infer a depleted, tholeiitic (N-MORB-like) origin for the amphibolite. The marked incompatible element depletion observed suggests that the parent melts of the amphibolite were generated in a setting far removed from any sources of enrichment. Phyllite-Quartzite Group During the Palaeotethys closure to the north, a continental rift zone was developed on the northern margin of the southern trailing Gondwana Plate. Sediments of the Phyllite-Quartzite Group represent the first sediments deposited within this newly formed rift basin. Due to the location of the rift, the source of the Phyllite- Quartzite Group sediments is likely to be totally confined to the basement of the South Portuguese Zone, and sedimentary fades relationships infer deposition on a shallow marine platform. Element geochemistry suggests that there were two discrete sources active during sedimentation. However, isotope geochemistry illustrates that both groups show old model ages and sNd values, typical of old, recycled crustal material, with group two being slightly less prevalent and older. Spatially, these groups appear to be randomly scattered. The presence of two discrete geochemical signatures is not necessarily indicative of two separate sources, but may arise from geochemical heterogeneity of a single provenance. However, the weight of evidence favours tow separate sediment sources. At the top of the Phyllite-Quartzite Group, sedimentation changes to turbulent processes, and this may coincide with the segmentation of the originally broad continuous basin into a set of sub-basins, with differential subsidence rates. Volcanic-Siliceous Complex The episodic nature of Volcanic-Siliceous Complex magmatism is likely to be triggered by episodic mantle doming, and it is likely that the base of the Volcanic-Siliceous Complex represents the transition from passive to active rifting conditions. Basic tholeiitic magmas are initially derived from a depleted N-MORB source due to their LREE characteristics. Subsequent contamination has given rise to the presently observed La-PR depleted REE profiles. Trace and REE mass balance calculations suggest approximately 50 % crustal contamination, but many other compelling lines of evidence favour a significantly smaller degree of contamination. Acid volcanics may be derived from partial melting of underplated basaltic magmas at the base of the continental crust. Periods of no igneous activity are represented within the complex by black shales, massive and stockwork sulphides and manganiferous cherts. Purple shales are randomly developed throughout the complex, but are almost ubiquitously present between the second and third volcanic events. Geochemistry does not clearly delineate the provenance of either the black or purple shales, but derivation from the Phyllite-Quartzite Group is favoured, with additional material from acid igneous rocks. Massive Sulphide And Stockwork Sulphide The large tonnages of sulphide generated within the Volcanic-Siliceous Complex requires high heat flow, and long-lived hydrothermal <b>circulation.</b> <b>Mantle</b> upwelling will compress the geothermal gradients and the resulting high heat flow will provide the heat necessary for establishment and continuation of the hydrothermal cells. Thus, sulphides are generated at the cessation of a phase of igneous activity, while the geothermal gradients remain elevated. Positive Eu anomalies characterise the massive sulphides and a s a result comparisons can be drawn between processes operating in the Volcanic-Siliceous Complex and present day oceanic vent sites. Lack of sulphide oxidation, absence of positive Ce anomaly and preservation of the positive Eu anomaly within massive sulphides indicates that interaction with seawater was minimised. Thus, sulphide precipitation is envisaged to have occurred under a a bottom-hugging blanket of highly saline, reducing brine. The origin of this brine is compared with the origin of Red Sea brines. Mass balance calculations illustrate that the incorporation of silicate within sulphide analysis has a variable impact on the REE profiles, depending upon the degree of contamination and the REE characteristics of the silicate phases. Manganiferous Chert Deposits Manganiferous cherts are dominantly biogenic, produced from radiolarian tests, with only minor participation of hydrothermal and hydrogenous sources. Reduced detrital input is necessary for a thriving radiolarian population, and as the depositional basins were compartmentalised and separated by small ridges, this suggests that the surface area of sediment source areas was diminished. Absence of radiolarian tests is attributed to recrystallisation, as tests initially comprise amorphous silica. Chert REE and Nd-isotope geochemistry is variable and this is attributed to the presence or absence of detrital and/or volcanic material, which overprints the initial hydrothermal characteristics. This variation in signature is dominantly controlled by the spatial location of the chert, within the depositional basin., Genetically, both the massive sulphides and chert deposits are independent, the cherts being biogenic and sulphides being hydrothermal. Additionally, both may be precipitated concurrently. It has been previously suggested that sulphides were preserved and oxidation hindered, by the presence of siliceous gel cap. This is not necessary if bottom-hugging brines were present. This factor explains why sulphides are preserved in the absence of a capping horizon...|$|R

We show that inferences from seismic tomographic images based on the application of diagnostic functions (global and regional variance spectra and the radial correlation function) lead to the conclusion that the <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> is whole mantle in style if model SH 8 /WM 13 is employed. The split mantle tomographic inversion SHS/U 4 L 8 leads to the contradictory conclusion that the <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> is significantly impeded across the 660 km depth horizon. This latter interpretation is reinforced when we employ the new higher resolution split mantle model SH 12 /U 7 L 5 in our calculations. We demonstrate that the depth-dependent radial heat flow delivered by both of the split models implies the existence of a thermal boundary layer at 660 km depth, and therefore significant layering, whereas that delivered by the whole mantle model does not. By insisting that the depth-dependent viscosity profile of the mantle be compatible with the thermal structure if the flow were layered, we argue that the split mantle tomographic inversions lead to a self-consistent description of geodynamic constraints (geoid and postglacial rebound data) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecycling of oceanic crust through subduction, mantle upwelling, and {{remelting}} in mantle plumes is {{a widely}} accepted mechanism to explain ocean island volcanism 1. The timescale of this recycling is important {{to our understanding of}} <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> rates. Correlations of uranogenic lead isotopes in lavas from ocean islands such as Hawaii or Iceland, when interpreted as model isochrons, have yielded source differentiation ages between 1 and 2. 5 billion years (Gyr) 2, 3, 4, 5. However, if such correlations are produced by mixing of unrelated mantle components 6 they will have no direct age significance. Re-Os decay model ages take into account the mixing of sources with different histories 7, 8, but they depend on the assumed initial Re/Os ratio of the subducted crust, which is poorly constrained because of the high mobility of rhenium during subduction 9. Here we report the first data on 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios for 138 melt inclusions in olivine phenocrysts from lavas of Mauna Loa shield volcano, Hawaii, indicating enormous mantle source heterogeneity. We show that highly radiogenic strontium in severely rubidium-depleted melt inclusions matches the isotopic composition of 200 - 650 -Myr-old sea water. We infer that such sea water must have contaminated the Mauna Loa source rock, before subduction, imparting a unique 'time stamp' on this source. Small amounts of seawater-derived strontium in plume sources may be common but can be identified clearly only in ultra-depleted melts originating from generally highly (incompatible-element) depleted source components. The presence of 200 - 650 -Myr-old oceanic crust in the source of Hawaiian lavas implies a timescale of general <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> with an average rate of about 2 (± 1) cm yr- 1, much faster than previously thought...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, tomographic imaging has {{revealed}} that trajectories of mantle convection are more complex than expected from end-member models of unhindered whole <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> or layered convection with an interface at 660 km depth. In the context of recently proposed mantle flow models, we discuss evidence for compositional heterogeneity in the deepest 1000 km of the mantle, and describe how this could survive {{in a system of}} thermo-chemical convection. Introduction: developing views on mantle convection In recent years, several models of mantle convection have been proposed to reconcile geophysical, geological, and geochemical constraints. These models need not provide the best fit to particular data sets but should be permissible within their uncertainty. Here we discuss some results of our research on wavespeed ratios and body wave scattering in the framewor...|$|E
40|$|Sampling {{convection}} in the Earth's mantle by {{seismic tomography}} is difficult {{as evidenced by}} the uneven distribution of seismic stations and events with some regions being well imaged compared to others. Here we quantitatively explore tomographic filtering on Earth structure by tracing ISC P‐body‐wave data through a computer simulation of <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> which accounts for internal heating of the mantle by radioactive decay, heatflux from the core, a depthwise increase in viscosity, and plate motion history of the past 120 million years. The travel time residuals are inverted by solving jointly for structure and hypocentral parameters with explicit damping and smoothing. We recover the Farallon and Tethys slabs as well as some low velocity anomalies associated with hot upwelling flow suggesting that tomographic filtering is probably minor in areas of high ray density...|$|E
40|$|Two {{cross-sections}} of {{the western}} Mediterranean Neogene-to-present back-arc basin are presented, in which geological and geophysical data of the TRANSMED Project are tied to a new shear-wave tomography. Major results are i) {{the presence of a}} well stratified upper mantle beneath the older African continent, with a marked low-velocity layer between 130 - 200  km of depth; ii) the dilution of this layer within the younger western Mediterranean back-arc basin to the north, and iii) the easterly raising of a shallower low-velocity layer from about 140  km to about 30  km in the Tyrrhenian active part of the back-arc basin. These findings suggest upper <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> in the western Mediterranean back-arc basin, mostly easterly-directed and affecting the boundary between upper asthenosphere (LVZ) and lower asthenosphere, which undulates between about 180  km and 280  km. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|The long-wavelength geoid and {{topography}} are dynamic {{effects of}} a convecting mantle. The long-wavelength geoid of the Earth is controlled by density variations in the mantle and has been explained by circulation models involving whole mantle flow. However, the relationship of long-wavelength topography to <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> has been a puzzling problem in geodynamics. We show that the dynamic topography is mainly due to density variations in the upper mantle, even after the effects of lithospheric cooling and crustal thickness variation are taken into account. Layered mantle convection, with a shallow origin for surface dynamic topography, {{is consistent with the}} spectrum, small amplitude and pattern of the topography. Layered mantle convection, with a barrier about 250 km deeper than the 670 km phase boundary, provides a self-consistent geodynamic model for the amplitude and pattern of both the long-wavelength geoid and surface topography...|$|E
40|$|We present {{dynamically}} self-consistent mantle-scale laboratory {{models that}} have been conducted to improve {{our understanding of the}} influence of slab window opening on subduction dynamics, mantle flow and associated dynamic topography over geological time scales. The adopted setup consists of a two-layer linearly viscous system simulating the subduction of a fixed plate of silicone (lithosphere) under negative buoyancy in a viscous layer of glucose syrup (mantle). Our experimental setting is also characterized by a constant-width rectangular window located {{at the center of a}} laterally confined slab, modeling the case of the interaction of a trench-parallel spreading ridge with a wide subduction zone. We found that the opening of a slab window does not produce consistent changes of the geometry and the kinematics of the slab. On the contrary, slab-induced <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation,</b> quantified both in the vertical and horizontal sections using the Feature Tracking image analysis technique, is strongly modified. In particular, rollback subduction and the opening of the slab window generate a complex <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation</b> pattern characterized by the presence of poloidal and toroidal components, with the importance of each evolving according to kinematic stages. Mantle coming from the oceanic domain floods through the slab window, indenting the supra-slab mantle zone and producing its deformation without any mixing between mantle portions. The opening of the slab window and the upwelling of sub-slab mantle produce a regional-scale non-isostatic topographic uplift of the overriding plate that would correspond to values ranging between ca. 1 and 5 km in nature. Assuming that our modeling results can be representative of the natural behavior of subduction zones, we compared them to the tectonics and volcanism of the Patagonian subduction zone. We found that the anomalous backarc volcanism that has been developing since the middle Miocene could result from the lateral flow of sub-slab mantle and that part of the Patagonian uplift could be dynamically supported.

40|$|International audienceSeismic {{anisotropy}} is a ubiquitous {{feature of}} the subcontinental mantle. This can be inferred both from direct seismic observations of shear wave splitting from teleseismic shear waves, {{as well as the}} petrofabric analyses of mantle nodules from kimberlite pipes. The anisotropy is principally due to the strain-induced lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of olivine. The combined use of these mantle samples, deformation experiments on olivine, and numerical modeling of LPO, provides a critical framework for making inferences about mantle deformation from observed seismic anisotropy. In most cases there is a close correspondence between mantle deformation derived from seismic observations of anisotropy, and crustal deformation, from the Archean to the present. This implies that the mantle plays a major, if not dominant role in continental deformation. No clear evidence is found for a continental asthenospheric decoupling zone, suggesting that continents are probably coupled to general <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation...</b>|$|E
30|$|In contrast, {{the pattern}} of LLSVPs has been {{interpreted}} as a root mantle structure that prevailed for several hundreds of Myr (Burke 2011; Burke et al. 2008; Dziewonski et al. 2010). Evidence for long-lived mantle structure comes from hotspot reconstructions (Torsvik et al. 2006) and paleomagnetic pole locations that indicate substantial true polar wander in the Mesozoic (Courtillot and Besse 1987). The dynamical origin of this (stationary) degree- 2 pattern may be two mantle superplumes (Romanowicz and Gung 2002; Torsvik et al. 2010), plume clusters (Schubert et al. 2004) or dense chemical piles above the CMB (McNamara and Zhong 2005; Tackley 2002; Tan and Gurnis 2007). Permanent or not, the thermochemical piles are clearly dynamic and respond {{to changes in the}} global <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation,</b> through variations in their footprints above the CMB and their height in the lower mantle. Variations in either or both of these would affect the mean CMB heat flux and the amplitude of its heterogeneity.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we have {{determined}} detailed Vp and Vs seismic velocity models of the Ionian lithosphere subducting beneath the Tyrrhenian basin and of the surrounding mantle, by applying a post-processing technique to a large sample of local earthquake tomography studies. Our seismic velocity models permit us to infer the presence of low velocity anomalies within the slab, which we interpret as regions that are partially hydrated by fluids released during the subduction process. A petrological interpretation of the velocity anomalies gives new details on the magmatism of the volcanic Aeolian arc. Furthermore our velocity models provide a more {{detailed description of the}} boundary of the slab and its connection with the large seismically active Tindari-Letojanni strike slip system. Finally these results allow describing in detail some features of the slab as the presence of lateral and vertical tears. In conclusion, the obtained models provide some constraints for inferences on <b>mantle</b> <b>circulation,</b> and on the geodynamical evolution of the central-western Mediterranean...|$|E
