5|$|Construction of {{the station}} started in 1918 and was {{finished}} in 1921. The station, excluding its water tower and restaurant, cost 117,062 Norwegian krone (NOK) to build and took 26,883 <b>man-hours.</b> The station and axillary buildings were designed by Gudmund Hoel of NSB Arkitektkontor. The station opened with {{the first part of}} the Rauma Line on 19 November 1921. It remained the terminus until 25 November 1923, when the next section, to Verma Station, opened.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} in summer of 1984, but was delayed several times for over a year. Before its announcement, Swords and Sorcery had been in development from nearly two years prior to 1985. PSS explained the delays as due to game's complexity that required a lot programming <b>man-hours.</b> The game was PSS's biggest launch to date. Upon release, Swords and Sorcery came with t-shirts, badges and posters.|$|E
5|$|A {{central part}} of the {{non-discrimination}} policy is the Mining Code of 7 August 1925. It is uncertain if the code is internationally binding, or if it can be amended unilaterally by Norway. Specifically, the commissioner issues licenses to search for minerals and state-owned and other owner's land and to register claims. To maintain a claim, the owner must work 1,500 <b>man-hours</b> per five years and pay an annual fee of 6,000 Norwegian krone. However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry may grant exceptions from the work obligation under specific conditions.|$|E

5|$|As elsewhere, {{sabotage}} {{was employed}} against enemy {{military and economic}} assets, with railway lines and bridges being common targets. The activities of Groupe G, a small student resistance cell based in Brussels, alone are estimated to have cost the Nazis 10 million <b>man-hours</b> of labour to repair damages done. Direct attacks on German troops and military installations were rarer, yet one estimate puts the number of German soldiers killed by the Belgian resistance in 1941 as higher than in all of France.|$|E
5|$|As the DVD {{featurette}} Within a Minute illustrates, {{the film}} required 910 artists and 70,441 <b>man-hours</b> to create 49 seconds of footage for the Mustafar duel alone.

5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the Navy set up twenty-one large winches on the island to turn the Oklahoma upright {{so it could be}} re-floated and patched before being scrapped. Coral was piled between the ship and the island so the ship would roll upright, instead of sliding toward the shore. Despite {{recovery}} efforts and patching, the Oklahoma sank during a mid-Pacific storm while it was being towed to the scrapyard. Nevada, California, West Virginia and the minelayer USS Oglala were re-floated and salvaged by the Navy. The entire salvage operation took 20,000 <b>man-hours</b> underwater and 5,000 dives to recover human remains, weapons, ammunition and artifacts of historic or military importance.|$|E

Only the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood. The massive sets designed by Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 <b>man-hours</b> to construct (roughly 1000 hours by each of the crew on average). They were shot at three of France's largest film studios in Épinay and Boulogne-Billancourt.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{was mostly}} done by volunteers; the {{building}} of the stadium required 31,000 <b>man-hours</b> in volunteer work and cost NOK 150,000. After the land was cleared, a layer of mixed sand and earth were laid. The pitch, with the dimensions , was sown in mid-1950. The work also included a grandstand, changing rooms, a watering system and kiosks. The stand could accommodate 2,500 spectators, and the stadium had a total permitted capacity of 6,000 people. The inaugural match was played against Sarpsborg on 7 July 1951 in front of 3,500 spectators. A training pitch beside the stadium pitch opened in 1953. The following year, a new steel entrance was built, following in 1955 with a referees' changing room and administrative offices. In 1959, after eight years of planning, construction of an additional terrace started, which opened in 1960.|$|E
5|$|For {{the bridge}} over Ydseelva in Verdal, {{which had a}} main span of only , {{construction}} started in April 1903 and was completed on 21 November. The area has quik clay, so the bridge needed piling. At Røra, a spur was originally planned to Hylla, but this was discarded late in the planning phase. At Hellem in Inderøy the right-of-way had to be moved because of poor soil mechanics. There were similar issues north of the Lunnan Tunnel, forcing the tunnel to be extended and a supporting being built. Construction of the tunnel was performed by 40 men {{during the winter of}} 1904 and 1905. It cost NOK90,179 and took 23.9 <b>man-hours</b> per meter to build.|$|E

The tunnel has the NSI-63 relay-based signaling system, although it {{was scheduled to be}} replaced by European Rail Traffic Management System shortly after 2015. The last six weeks before opening, the Vestfold Line was closed to allow the new and old sections to be connected. This was the most hectic part of construction, as it saw the tracks south of the tunnel be rearranged to allow trains to operate the opposite direction through the loop in Tønsberg. The work was performed by Reinertsen and took 100,000 <b>man-hours.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Leopard2E {{is a major}} {{improvement}} over the M60 Patton tank, which it replaced in Spain's mechanized and armored units. Its development represented a total of 2.6million <b>man-hours</b> worth of work, 9,600 of them in Germany, at a total cost of 2.4billion euros. This makes {{it one of the}} most expensive Leopard 2s built. Indigenous production amounted to 60% and the vehicles were assembled locally at Sevilla by Santa Bárbara Sistemas. It has thicker armor on the turret and glacis plate than the German Leopard 2A6, and uses a Spanish-designed tank command and control system, similar to the one fitted in German Leopard 2s. The Leopard2E is expected to remain in service until 2025.|$|E
5|$|The {{third stage}} of the Hornet Upgrade Program sought to rectify {{airframe}} damage. HUG Phase 3.1 involved minor structural work to all aircraft as they passed through other phases of the program. The centre fuselages of the ten Hornets assessed as suffering {{the greatest amount of}} structural damage were replaced in HUG Phase 3.2. It was originally intended that all the RAAF's Hornets would receive new centre fuselages, but the scope of this phase of the program was reduced after {{it was found that the}} number of <b>man-hours</b> needed to upgrade each aircraft was much greater than originally estimated. The ten aircraft were upgraded at an L-3 Communications facility in Canada, and all were returned to service by June 2010.|$|E
5|$|Belgium's {{strategic}} location {{meant that}} it constituted an important supply hub for the whole German army in Northern Europe and particularly northern France. Sabotage was therefore an important duty of the resistance. Following the Normandy landings in June 1944 on orders from the Allies, the Belgian resistance began to step up its sabotage against German supply lines across the country. Between June and September alone, 95 railroad bridges, 285 locomotives, 1,365 wagons and 17 tunnels were all blown up by the Belgian resistance. Telegraph lines were also cut and road bridges and canals used to transport material sabotaged. In one notable action, 600 German soldiers were killed when a railway bridge between La Gleize and Stoumont in the Ardennes was blown up by 40 members of the resistance, including the writer Herman Bodson. Indeed, more German troops were reportedly killed in Belgium in 1941 than in all of Occupied France. Through its sabotage activities alone, one resistance group, , required the Germans to expend between 20 and 25 million <b>man-hours</b> of labour on repairing damage done, including ten million in the night of 15–16 January 1944 alone.|$|E

5|$|Hawley's {{first period}} (945–1030) was {{suggested}} by tree ring dates scattered throughout later parts of Chetro Ketl. Archeologists subsequently discovered that her second period (1030–90) structure was built directly over an earlier (990–1030) one-story-tall, two-room-wide row of rooms. Lekson shortened Hawley's second period to 1030–75, and subdivided it into {{at least eight}} different construction events, including the successive additions of upper stories along the main room block, running {{the length of the}} building. After 1075, construction consisted of minor additions and alternations, {{with the exception of a}} row of three large, Chaco-style second- and third-story round rooms that were added to the plaza-facing center of the main room block during 1075–95. Much of the later construction, including the large Chaco-style kivas, was in McElmo style masonry, using shaped blocks of relatively soft tan colored sandstone instead of the previously preferred harder, denser dark brown sandstone, which may have been quarried out in the central canyon after 1075. Chetro Ketl required an estimated 50 million sandstone blocks and more than 500,000 <b>man-hours</b> to complete.|$|E
5|$|In August 1981 {{the program}} {{received}} a boost when British Aerospace (BAe) and McDonnell Douglas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), marking the UK's re-entry into the program. The British government was enticed by the lower cost of acquiring Harriers promised {{by a large}} production run, {{and the fact that}} the US was shouldering the expense of development. Under the agreement BAe was relegated to the position of a subcontractor, instead of the full partner status that would have been the case had the UK not left the program. Consequently, the company received, in <b>man-hours,</b> 40 percent of the airframe work-share. Aircraft production took place at McDonnell Douglas' facilities in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, and manufacturing by BAe at its Kingston and Dunsfold facilities in Surrey, England. Meanwhile, 75 percent work-share for the engine went to Rolls-Royce, which had previously absorbed Bristol Siddeley, with the remaining 25 percent assigned to Pratt & Whitney. The two companies planned to manufacture 400 Harrier IIs, with the USMC expected to procure 336 aircraft and the RAF, 60.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas's first {{proposed}} remedy {{was a complete}} moratorium {{on the use of}} Indian labor in the Indies until such time as better regulations of it were set in place. This was meant simply to halt the decimation of the Indian population and to give the surviving Indians time to reconstitute themselves. Las Casas feared that at the rate the exploitation was proceeding it would be too late to hinder their annihilation unless action were taken rapidly. The second was a change in the labor policy so that instead of a colonist owning the labor of specific Indians, he would have a right to <b>man-hours,</b> to be carried out by no specific persons. This required the establishment of self-governing Indian communities on the land of colonists – who would themselves organize to provide the labor for their patron. The colonist would only have rights to a certain portion of the total labor, so that a part of the Indians were always resting and taking care of the sick. He proposed 12 other remedies, all having the specific aim of improving the situation for the Indians and limiting the powers that colonists were able to exercise over them.|$|E
