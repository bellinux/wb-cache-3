5|$|A third type {{of common}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>is</b> the {{installation}} and replacement of sacrificial anodes along the subterranean portions of pipeline. These anodes reduce the corrosion caused by electrochemical action that affect these interred sections of pipeline. Excavation and {{replacement of the}} anodes is required as they corrode.|$|E
5|$|Each {{aircraft}} {{requires a}} month-long packaged maintenance plan (PMP) every 300 flight hours. The stealth system, including its radar absorbing metallic skin, account for almost {{one third of}} maintenance. The canopy was redesigned after the original design lasted an average of 331 hours instead of the required 800 hours. F-22 depot <b>maintenance</b> <b>is</b> performed at Ogden Air Logistics Complex at Hill AFB, Utah.|$|E
5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are {{followed closely by}} the patient. Immediate loading implants may have {{a higher rate of}} failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and <b>maintenance</b> <b>is</b> well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.|$|E

25|$|After {{conversion}} to electrical operation the boat lift was operated successfully for 75 years. Regular <b>maintenance</b> <b>was</b> still necessary; for example, the wire ropes supporting the caissons suffered from fatigue from the repeated {{bending and straightening}} as they ran over the overhead pulleys {{and had to be}} replaced frequently. However, <b>maintenance</b> <b>was</b> simpler than before the conversion because the mechanism of the electrical lift <b>was</b> above ground. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>was</b> also less expensive because the caissons were now designed to be run independently, allowing most <b>maintenance</b> to <b>be</b> carried out while one caisson remained operational and thus avoiding the need to close the lift entirely.|$|R
5|$|Nathu La has {{moderately}} shallow, excessively drained, coarse, and {{loamy soil}} {{on a steep}} slope (30–50%) with gravelly loamy surface, moderate erosion, and moderate stoniness. It has several sinking zones and parts of it are prone to landslides. To preserve the fragile environment of Nathu La on the Indian side, the government of India regulates the flow of tourists. Road <b>maintenance</b> <b>is</b> entrusted to Border Roads Organisation, a wing of the Indian Army. On the Chinese side the pass leads to the Chumbi Valley of the Tibetan Plateau.|$|E
5|$|No. 33 Squadron is {{responsible}} for aerial refuelling and long-range transport. It is located at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, and controlled by No.86 Wing, {{which is part of}} Air Mobility Group. The unit headquarters comprises executive, administrative and operational components. As well as aircrew, the squadron is staffed by maintenance personnel responsible for regular aircraft service. Heavier <b>maintenance</b> <b>is</b> conducted by Northrop Grumman Integrated Defence Services (formerly Qantas Defence Services).|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} factor that negatively affects <b>maintenance</b> <b>is</b> the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft and sale of spare parts and even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries. When not stealing spare parts and equipment, maintenance personnel often spend {{the better part of}} their duty day looking for other ways to profit. American maintenance teams working in Zaire found that providing a free lunch to the work force was a good, sometimes the only, technique to motivate personnel to work {{at least half of the}} duty day.|$|E

5|$|The {{pipeline}} is surveyed {{several times}} per day, mostly by air. Foot and road patrols also {{take place to}} check for problems such as leaks or pipe settling or shifting. The pipeline can be surveyed {{in as little as}} two hours, but most surveys take longer to ensure thoroughness. These external inspections are only part of standard maintenance, however. The majority of pipeline <b>maintenance</b> <b>is</b> done by pipeline pigs—mechanical devices sent through the pipeline to perform a variety of functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most {{studies have focused on}} the mating-type region in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its <b>maintenance,</b> <b>is</b> dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts. Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} refuel their nuclear power plants, the {{carriers}} each undergo a Refueling and Overhaul (RCOH) once in their service lives. This {{is also the}} most substantial overhaul the ships undergo while in service and involves bringing the vessels' equipment up to the standards of the newest ships. The ship is placed in dry dock, and essential <b>maintenance</b> <b>is</b> carried out including painting of the hull below the waterline and replacement of electrical and mechanical components such as valves. Because of the large time periods between the ships' constructions, the armament and designs of the newer ships are more modern than those of the older ships. In RCOH, the older ships are refitted to the standards of the newer ships, which can include major upgrades to the flight deck, aircraft catapults and combat systems as well as other upgrades such as improved radar systems, although precise details can vary significantly between the ships. The improvements normally take around four years to complete. The RCOH for USS Theodore Roosevelt took four years to complete (2009–2013) and cost about US$2.6 billion. Planned Incremental Availability is a similar procedure, although it is less substantial and does not involve refueling of the nuclear power plants.|$|E
5|$|With {{material}} from previous articles, Weisman uses {{the fate of}} the Mayan civilization to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence. To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the Panama Canal, where constant <b>maintenance</b> <b>is</b> required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams. To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from Chernobyl, Ukraine (abandoned in 1986) and Varosha, Cyprus (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing Istanbul, as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the underground cities in Cappadocia. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster. Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of volcanic tuff, and are likely to survive for centuries to come.|$|E

The quality of <b>maintenance</b> <b>was</b> extremely varied (range of maintenance scores, 8 - 30; mean, 22 (S. D., 5. 0); median, 23; maximum possible, 33) and some towers were neglected. Breaches of <b>maintenance</b> principles <b>were</b> mainly structural and organizational, e. g. inadequate drift control, rather than failure to use chemicals. Low <b>maintenance</b> scores <b>were</b> associated with no log book, no guidelines, no change in procedures in last 5 years, solitary cooling towers, and towers on industrial premises. Despite intense publicity the standard of cooling tower maintenance in Glasgow remained a concern.
