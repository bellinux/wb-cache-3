5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or eelgrass. Where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marshes contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common <b>marsh</b> <b>plants.</b> The uncommon spiral tasselweed and long-bracted sedge are other lower salt marsh specialists. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh, although they are uncommon in the UK away from this coast.

25|$|Thousands of snow geese {{winter in}} the Skagit River estuary. These geese feed on {{intertidal}} <b>marsh</b> <b>plants</b> such as bulrush and they are drawn to nearby farmlands where they find leftover potatoes in the fields. Trumpeter swans {{are drawn to the}} estuary habitat as well. There can be several hundred swans in the Skagit valley from October to February.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} {{salinity}} {{can also be}} quite variable. Low salinities {{can be caused by}} rainwater or river inputs of freshwater. Estuarine species must be especially euryhaline, or able to tolerate a wide range of salinities. High salinities occur in locations with high evaporation rates, such as in salt marshes and high intertidal pools. Shading by plants, especially in the salt marsh, can slow evaporation and thus ameliorate salinity stress. In addition, salt <b>marsh</b> <b>plants</b> tolerate high salinities by several physiological mechanisms, including excreting salt through salt glands and preventing salt uptake into the roots.|$|E

50|$|Damasonium alisma is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} <b>marsh</b> <b>plant</b> known by the common name of starfruit. Its native range includes parts of Great Britain, France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, and Kazakhstan.|$|R
25|$|Die-off could {{potentially}} be explained by pathogens of salt <b>marsh</b> <b>plants</b> in some areas - fungal species have been identified at die-off sites in the UK as well as US Atlantic and Gulf coast sites (Elmer 2013). Fungal-facilitated marsh degradation is a documented concern in the Southeast Atlantic in particular. Marsh snails Littoraria irrorata make minor cuts in the cordgrass during grazing. These cuts facilitate growth of fungus, and at high snail densities, can lead to mass infections, increased grazing and consequent die-off (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman and Newell 2003, Silliman et al. 2005).|$|E
25|$|One {{theory of}} {{bottom-up}} control lies with differential soil chemistry between vegetated and die-off areas. Drought-associated changes in soil chemistry {{have been proposed}} {{to be associated with}} areas of die-off. Droughts are often associated with increased salinity and acidity stress - soils oxidize under freshwater or tidal moisture limitation, leading to increased acidity. Hypersalinity has been linked to reduced S. alterniflora survival (Brown et al. 2005). However, salt <b>marsh</b> <b>plants</b> are generally tolerant of a broad range of salinity levels, and increased salinity has not consistently been observed in die-off sites (Alber et al. 2008).|$|E
25|$|The {{saltmarsh}} and {{the dunes}} both hold a notably {{wide range of}} plants, including a number of uncommon species. The saltmarsh contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common <b>marsh</b> <b>plants.</b> The shingle ridges attract biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift, bird's foot trefoil and sea beet. sea wormwood, sea lavender and scrubby sea-blite also thrive, matted sea lavender and sea heath are international important species found in this habitat.|$|E
50|$|Silverweed is {{most often}} found in sandy or gravelly soils, where it may spread rapidly by its {{prolific}} rooting stolons. It typically occurs in inland habitats, unlike A. egedii, which is a salt-tolerant coastal salt <b>marsh</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|R

50|$|As {{would be}} {{expected}} of a mouse native to salt marshes, this species is a competent swimmer and is tolerant of salt in its diet and water supply. It eats seeds and plants, especially pickleweed and glasswort, {{one of the most}} common salt <b>marsh</b> <b>plant</b> species.|$|R
25|$|Plant species {{diversity}} is relatively low, since the flora must be tolerant of salt, complete or partial submersion, and anoxic mud substrate. The most common salt <b>marsh</b> <b>plants</b> are glassworts (Salicornia spp.) and the cordgrass (Spartina spp.), which have worldwide distribution. They {{are often the}} first plants to take hold in a mudflat and begin its ecological succession into a salt marsh. Their shoots lift the main flow of the tide above the mud surface while their roots spread into the substrate and stabilize the sticky mud and carry oxygen into it so that other plants can establish themselves as well. Plants such as sea lavenders (Limonium spp.), plantains (Plantago spp.), and varied sedges and rushes grow once the mud has been vegetated by the pioneer species.|$|E
25|$|One of Langston's most {{difficult}} challenges {{is dealing with}} the giant Canada geese (Branta canadensis maxima) which inhabit the tidal marshes of Kingman Lake and the Anacostia River. Hundreds of the birds inhabit the marshes. The birds not only feed voraciously on the course's grasses, but their feces harm the greens and pose a health hazard to golfers. They also feed on and destroy the <b>marsh</b> <b>plants</b> which the National Park Service planted in Kingman Lake and the Anacostia River in the hope that these will help filter the water and restore the health of the river. In 2007, federal park officials began considering a program to cull the geese population around Langston Golf Course in an attempt to save the river, an effort opposed by some animal rights groups.|$|E
25|$|In salt marshes, early ecologists like Eugene Odum and John Teal {{sparked the}} current {{bottom-up}} paradigm in ecology through work on Sapelo Island, GA (U.S.A) that stressed the dominant role of physical factors like temperature, salinity, and nutrients in regulating plant primary productivity and ecosystem structure (Teal 1962, Odum 1971). Ecologists noted that <b>marsh</b> <b>plants</b> were not heavily grazed {{and appeared to}} be relatively unpalatable, and thus argued that most plants entered salt marsh food chains as detritus (Teal 1962). A corollary of this dogma is that consumers play an unimportant or subtle role in controlling salt marsh primary production (Smalley 1960, Teal 1962). This paradigm was widely accepted for decades and applied to other ecosystems like mangroves and seagrass beds (Bertness 2007), and has thus “become entrenched in the conceptual understanding of coastal ecosystems” (quote from Bertness and Silliman 2008; Smalley 1960, Nixon 1982).|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{compared}} and analysed vegetation {{communities in the}} estuarine tidal flats {{of the four major}} rivers of Ise Bay (Suzuka River, Tanaka River, Kushida River and Miya River) in Mie Prefecture, Japan. Along the Suzuka River, Eragrostis curvula of the exotic plant accounted for 60. 0 % or more of the entire surface area, and the plant volume was high. Along the Tanaka River, Suaeda maritima community occupied the sand-mud zone {{in the vicinity of the}} shoreline on gravel bars, while Phragmites australis community was distributed along a shallow lake upstream. In the Kushida River, a salt <b>marsh</b> <b>plant</b> community (a community type found in areas flooded at high tide) of Suaeda maritima, Phragmites australis and Artemisia scoparia was distributed on the sand-mud surface along the main river. A salt <b>marsh</b> <b>plant</b> community (a community type found in areas that do not flood at high tide) of Phacelurus latifolius accounted for least 50. 0 % of the entire surface area. Along the Miya River, the area covered by the annual salt <b>marsh</b> <b>plant</b> community type was larger than the area occupied by this community type along the other rivers. The flow volume of the Miya River was high in April, June and August-October of 2006, July and September of 2007 and April-June of 2008. The flow volume was especially high in July 2007, when it reached levels above 1500. 0 m 3 /s; change in flow volume was also large. We suggest that a large-scale disturbance occurred in the estuary, resulting in the formation of a gravelly sandy surface where an annual salt <b>marsh</b> <b>plant</b> community of Suaeda maritime and Artemisia scoparia has been established and grown as the annual precipitation and catchment volume of the basin have increased. </p...|$|R
50|$|Other plants {{occurring}} in the higher-salinity regions of the marsh include saltmeadow cordgrass (S. patens),giant cordgrass (S. cynosuroides), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), glassworts (Salicornia spp.), Olney threesquare (Scirpus americanus), and saltmarsh bulrush (Scirpus robustus). In the brackish <b>marsh</b> <b>plant</b> associates may include sealavender (Limonium carolinianum) and common arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia). In the intermediate marsh between the brackish and freshwater <b>marsh</b> levels other <b>plants</b> include common reed (Phragmites australis), sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), softstem bulrush (Scirpus validus), and Virginia iris (Iris virginica).|$|R
50|$|Jaumea carnosa, {{known by}} the common names marsh jaumea, fleshy jaumea, or simply jaumea, is a {{halophytic}} salt <b>marsh</b> <b>plant</b> native {{to the west coast}} of North America.

25|$|For example, {{eutrophication}} initiates top-down control via {{the impact}} of snow geese on the arctic marshes of Hudson Bay (Jefferies 1997). By the 1980s, the snow geese that originally annually migrated to Hudson Bay had switched from feeding in temperate wetlands to feeding in heavily fertilized agricultural fields. Over a period of 30 years, the geese population exploded. Snow geese have since utterly destroyed {{hundreds of thousands of}} acres of the Hudson Bay wetland. The geese grubbed marsh plant roots, evaporation increased leading to subsequent salinity increase, and without plants to oxygenate the soil the substrate became anoxic. This undesirable environment for <b>marsh</b> <b>plants</b> disallows sexual recruitment to the area. Snow geese have denuded the marsh until recolonization by clonal runners can restore marsh vegetation, which could take years. Because of the use of artificial fertilizers on temperate zone agricultural fields, a trophic cascade was initiated (Jefferies 1997).|$|E
25|$|The yellowfin whiting is a benthic predator, {{using its}} well {{developed}} eyesight and a downward pointing jaws {{that can be}} protruded to 'suck up' and capture its prey from the seafloor. Studies on the mouth morphology {{of a range of}} sillaginids concluded that the mouth morphology of most species has little influence on the type of prey caught, with differences in diet more likely due to variations in the foraging behavior. Studies conducted in southwest Western Australia found the species predominantly takes polychaetes as its main prey item, although crustaceans, particularly amphipods and penaeids also make up a large portion of its diet. Items taken infrequently or in lesser amounts include small teleost fish, bivalve molluscs, marine plant material and other crustaceans such as tanaids, decapods and cumaceans. Modeling with the stable isotopes 13C and 15N indicate that seagrass and epiphytic algae were the primary initial sources of energy and nutrition that flow into the fish via detritivores which the species preys on, with salt <b>marsh</b> <b>plants</b> and macroalgae contributing in some settings.|$|E

2500|$|Human {{introduction}} of non-native species can {{also contribute to}} top-down control of marsh systems (Furbish and Albano 1994, Gough and Grace 1998).

500|$|The Chincoteague Pony, {{also known}} as the Assateague horse, is a breed of pony that {{developed}} and lives in a feral condition on Assateague Island in the United States states of Virginia and Maryland. The breed was made famous by the Misty of Chincoteague series written by Marguerite Henry starting in 1947. While phenotypically horse-like, they are commonly called [...] "ponies". This {{is due in part to}} their smaller stature, created by the poor habitat on Assateague Island. Variation is found in their physical characteristics due to blood from different breeds being introduced at various points in their history. They can be any solid color, and are often found in pinto patterns, which are a favorite with breed enthusiasts. Island Chincoteagues live on a diet of salt <b>marsh</b> <b>plants</b> and brush. This poor-quality and often scarce food combined with uncontrolled inbreeding created a propensity for conformation faults in the Chincoteague before outside blood was added beginning in the early 20th century.|$|E
500|$|Freshwater sloughs {{are perhaps}} the most common {{ecosystem}} associated with Everglades National Park.

Shark River Slough and Taylor Slough are significant features of the park. Sawgrass growing to a height of [...] or more, and broad-leafed <b>marsh</b> <b>plants,</b> are so prominent in this region that they gave the Everglades its nickname , cemented in the public imagination in the title for Marjory Stoneman Douglas's book (1947), which culminated years of her advocacy for considering the Everglades ecosystem as more than a [...] "swamp". Excellent feeding locations for birds, sloughs in the Everglades attract a great variety of waders such as herons, egrets, roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), ibises and brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), as well as limpkins (Aramus guarauna) and snail kites that eat apple snail, which in turn feed on the sawgrass. The sloughs' availability of fish, amphibians, and young birds attract a variety of freshwater turtles, alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), water moccasin (Agkistrodon piscivorus conanti), and eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus).|$|E
