In response, Governor Longley called on the tribes to limit their claim {{to the value of}} the land as of 1796, without interest (the valuation method used in Indian Claims Commission cases), and called on Congress to pass legislation forcing the tribes to so limit their claim. Interior's memo reached Peter Taftthe grandson of President Taft, {{and the head of the}} Justice Department's Land and Natural Resources Divisionwho wrote to Judge Gignoux, declaring his intention to litigate test cases concerning [...] of forests (mostly owned by large forestry companies) within the claim area on June 1, unless a settlement was reached.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{the current}} {{doctrine}} {{is that a}} person cannot bring a suit challenging the constitutionality of a law unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that he/she/it is or will [...] "imminently" [...] be harmed by the law. Otherwise, the court will rule that the plaintiff [...] "lacks standing" [...] to bring the suit, and will dismiss the case without considering the <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> of unconstitutionality. To have a court declare a law unconstitutional, {{there must be a}} valid reason for the lawsuit. The party suing must have something to lose in order to sue unless it has automatic standing by action of law.|$|E
2500|$|On [...] December 29, 2009, [...] the California Court of Appeal for the Sixth District {{ruled that}} California Code of Civil Procedure Section 367 cannot {{be read as}} {{imposing}} a federal-style standing doctrine on California's code pleading system of civil procedure. [...] In California, the fundamental inquiry is always whether the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded a cause of action, [...] not whether the plaintiff has some entitlement to judicial action separate from proof of the substantive <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> advanced. The court acknowledged that the word [...] "standing" [...] is often sloppily {{used to refer to}} what is really jus tertii, and held that jus tertii in state law {{is not the same thing}} as the federal standing doctrine.|$|E

50|$|Justice Benjamin Robbins Curtis, in dissent, {{attacked}} much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court's {{decision as}} obiter dicta, {{on the ground}} that once the Court determined that it did not have jurisdiction to hear Scott's case, it must simply dismiss the action, and not pass judgment on <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claims.</b> <b>The</b> dissents by Curtis and McLean also attacked <b>the</b> Court's overturning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Missouri Compromise on its merits, noting both that it was not necessary to decide the question, and also that none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution had ever objected on constitutional grounds to the United States Congress' adoption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antislavery provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northwest Ordinance passed by the Continental Congress, or the subsequent acts that barred slavery north of 36°30' N.|$|R

50|$|Bond v.

50|$|The American Civil Liberties Union {{filed an}} {{ultimately}} unsuccessful {{lawsuit against the}} program in 2006 on behalf of journalists, scholars, and lawyers. In the initial trial, U.S. District Judge Anna Diggs Taylor on August 17, 2006, ruled the program was unconstitutional and imposed an injunction against it. The Justice Department filed an appeal within hours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruling and requested a stay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injunction pending appeal. While opposing the stay, the ACLU agreed to delay implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injunction until September 7 to allow time for the judge to hear the appeal. On appeal, <b>the</b> U.S. Court <b>of</b> Appeals for <b>the</b> Sixth Circuit dismissed the case without addressing <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claims,</b> holding 2-1 that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit.|$|R

50|$|In Bromfield v.

The EOIR also erred by failing to recognize that the Jamaican government not only acquiesces in the torture of gay men, but is also directly involved in such torture. The Court further clarified that even where a petitioner has been found removable based upon an aggravated felony the Court retains jurisdiction to review claims for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture if the denial was based upon the <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claim.</b>|$|E

25|$|Edward was {{a mature}} and widely {{respected}} king. The relationship {{between him and}} recently deceased King Alexander had been good.

50|$|On April 16, 2007, MacDonald's {{attorneys}} {{filed an}} affidavit of Stoeckley's mother, {{in which she}} states that her daughter confessed to her twice that {{she was at the}} MacDonald house on the evening of the murders and that she was afraid of the prosecutors. Her past statements concerning her daughter are at odds with the details contained in her affidavit. MacDonald has requested to expand the appeal to include all the evidence amassed at trial, evidence which he claims was discovered subsequent to the trial (for example, statements of individuals to whom Stoeckely had made confessions) and the DNA results completed in 2006. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals granted MacDonald's motion for a successive habeas petition and remanded the matter back to the District Court Eastern Division for a decision. In November 2008, Judge Fox denied MacDonald's motion regarding the statement of Britt. This denial was based on the <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claim,</b> generally that Stoeckley was unreliable, as she had made many varying statements regarding the murders. Also, that MacDonald's claim that she was expected to testify in a manner favorable to him until threatened by Blackburn is contradicted by the trial records. MacDonald's motions regarding the DNA results and the statement of Stoeckley's mother were also denied. The denial of these two motions was based on jurisdiction issues, specifically that MacDonald had not obtained the required pre-filing authorization from the Circuit Court for these motions to the District Court.|$|E

25|$|The state secrets {{privilege}} {{allows the}} president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from discovery in legal proceedings if such release would harm national security. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when Thomas Jefferson refused to release military documents in <b>the</b> treason trial <b>of</b> Aaron Burr and again in Totten v. United States , when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy. However, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until United States v. Reynolds , where it was held to be a common law evidentiary privilege. Before the September 11 attacks, use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency. Since 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suits before reaching <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claims,</b> as in <b>the</b> Ninth Circuit's ruling in Mohamed v.

5000|$|The above {{six points}} mirror the three {{pillars of the}} UN Guiding Principles; State duty to protect, {{corporate}} responsibility to respect, and access to remedy. The Guidelines require participating states to establish National Contact Points (NCP). Allegations from individuals can be brought forward to the NCP. These {{are referred to as}} specific instances. The <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> are then addressed by the NCP and if a case is found then an investigation will be undertaken. Mediation may take place between the company in question and the complainant as one of the final stages in the process. If a company is found to be in breach of the guidelines then a Final Statement will be produced outlining the violations of the Guidelines which occurred along with an impact assessment. Although remedies for any breaches of human rights are sought they cannot be enforced under the Guidelines. Amnesty International has commented that the Guidelines provide a [...] "lens for examining business conduct with regard to human rights." [...] In this sense {{it has been argued that}} the OECD Guidelines have the potential to promote a degree of accountability. Amnesty International in its Briefing for the UK National Contact Point advised on the potential repercussions of a Final Statement for companies found to be non-compliant. Reputation, ability to operate, and value of shares may all be detrimentally affected by a finding of non-compliance. Amnesty believes that this may act as a deterrent, leveling the playing field for those companies who ensure they adhere to human rights standards. The rationale behind this being that the cost-benefit relationship is altered in favour of adherence to human rights.|$|E
