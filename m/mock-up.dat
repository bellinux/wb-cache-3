5|$|The {{merchant}} ship SS Mamari III was converted to resemble Hermes as a decoy ship {{to confuse the}} Axis where Hermes was actually operating. The superstructure was mainly a wooden <b>mock-up.</b> She {{was a part of}} the phantom fleet of <b>mock-up</b> British warships designated as Fleet Tender C. On 4 June 1941, when she was sailing down the east coast of England to Chatham Dockyard in Kent to be converted back to a {{merchant ship}}, the decoy Hermes hit a submerged wreck and ran aground off Norfolk during a German aerial attack. Before being refloated she was totally disabled by German E-boats commanded by Niels Bätge. The Germans initially thought they had sunk an aircraft carrier.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we have studied how user {{designed}} <b>mock-ups,</b> together with video recordings, can contribute {{in the process}} of generating user requirements when designing the future e- newspaper. The <b>mock-ups</b> originate from future workshop carried out within the DigiNews project. By analyzing user designed <b>mock-ups</b> to retrieve user requirements and evaluating the results against a focus group and newspaper designers we gained understanding on how <b>mock-ups</b> can contribute as data input in a user involved design process. The study concludes that <b>mock-ups</b> are an effective tool for making use of users’ visions and opinions in a dynamic design process...|$|R

5|$|A <b>mock-up</b> was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract. It was shipped to Singapore {{and put on}} public display during the 1984 National Exhibition held in November 1984 at World Trade Centre. The <b>mock-up</b> featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give feedback on these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement. The bucket seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines for standing passengers were installed in the middle of every car. The colour scheme of each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour scheme of the driving trailer cars was orange, that of the second and fifth motor cars was blue, and that of the two centre motor cars was green. There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven after the first round of refurbishment.|$|E

5|$|The Avro Canada CF-103 was a {{proposed}} Canadian interceptor, designed by Avro Canada {{in the early}} 1950s as a development, and possible replacement of the company's CF-100 Canuck, that was entering service at the time with the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Although intended {{to be capable of}} flying at transonic speeds, the CF-103 only proffered a moderate increase in performance and capability over the CF-100; subsequently, the aircraft never progressed beyond the <b>mock-up</b> stage.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} Final Fantasy III in 1990, Square {{planned to}} develop two Final Fantasy games—one for the Nintendo Entertainment System {{and the other}} for the forthcoming Super NES, to be known as Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V respectively. Due to financial and scheduling constraints, Square dropped plans for the NES game and continued development of the SNES version, retitled Final Fantasy IV. A <b>mock-up</b> screenshot of the cancelled title was produced for a Japanese magazine, but little other information exists about it. Series creator and director Hironobu Sakaguchi has stated that the NES version was approximately 80% complete and certain ideas were reused for the SNES version.|$|E
5|$|Almost every fighter {{project in}} the postwar era {{immediately}} applied the concept, which started appearing on production fighters in the late 1940s. Avro engineers explored swept-wing and tail modifications to the CF-100 known as the CF-103, which had proceeded to wooden <b>mock-up</b> stage. The CF-103 offered improved transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. However, the basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and the advantages were continually eroded. When a CF-100 broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952, interest in the CF-103 waned.|$|E
30|$|Compared to <b>mock-ups</b> A and B, the {{locations}} of the measurement devices for <b>mock-ups</b> C to F were chosen more uniformly across the panel, such that variations of the response across the specimen could be clearly identified, see Fig.  5 b. The <b>mock-ups</b> were equipped with eight horizontal LVDTs to measure the displacement in radial material direction (LVDT 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the front surface and LVDT 5, 6, 7 and 8 on the back surface). The LVDTs were located close to the upper cleated end, one on each of the three vertical boards and one covering the total width of the <b>mock-ups.</b> <b>Mock-ups</b> C and E were equipped with 18 strain gauges (SG 1, 2, 5 – 11 on the front surface and SG 12, 13, 16 – 22 on the back surface) and <b>mock-ups</b> D and F were equipped with 22 strain gauges (SG 1 – 11 on the front surface and SG 12 – 22 on the back surface). The strain gauges were positioned on the boards and across the glue joints. Two moisture content sensors (MC 1 and MC 2) were applied, one at the centre of the left board and one {{at the bottom of the}} right board. In addition, two temperature and relative humidity sensors (RH/T) were placed at the centre of the <b>mock-ups,</b> close to the front and back surfaces.|$|R

5|$|Competition for the {{contract}} was so fierce that it involved last-minute discounts, offers of free parts and allegations of sabotage. Metro-Cammell, Kawasaki and ASEA were shortlisted for the final round. Metro-Cammell based its design on the Hong Kong MTR M-Train EMU and proposed to use the GEC propulsion system had they won {{the contract}}. Metro-Cammell also delivered a concept <b>mock-up</b> and was originally the favourite to win the contract. However, analysts became concerned that a measuring error involving the London Underground 1983 Stock during the evaluation period could jeopardise their bid.|$|E
5|$|In October, {{the second}} unit {{travelled}} to Nassau to film the underwater sequences. To perform the car becoming a submarine, seven different models were used, {{one for each}} step of the transformation. One of the models was a fully mobile submarine equipped with an engine built by Miami-based Perry Submarines. The car seen entering the sea was a <b>mock-up</b> shell, propelled off the jetty by a compressed air cannon. During the model sequences, the air bubbles seen appearing from the vehicle were created by Alka-Seltzer tablets.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the company's former test pilot, Lou Leavitt, had {{purchased}} {{the wreckage of}} the XR-1A at a price of 4 cents per pound. Leavitt had formed a new company, Helicopter Air Transport, intending to provide helicopter flight training in anticipation of a postwar aviation boom, and he returned the XR-1A to flying condition. The projected boom failed to materialise, however, and HAT quickly entered bankruptcy, Leavitt selling the XR-1A to Frank Piasecki, another former Platt-LePage employee who had now started his own helicopter company. Piasecki soon grounded the aircraft due to airworthiness concerns, and used the airframe {{in the development of the}} PA-2B, a planned tiltrotor which failed to proceed beyond the <b>mock-up</b> stage.|$|E
30|$|The damage {{observed}} on door panels of historical Dutch cabinets {{is illustrated in}} Fig.  2, and, as reported in [10, 25], may be induced by indoor climate fluctuations.

5|$|On 5 June 1946, Boeing's Model 462, a straight-wing {{aircraft}} {{powered by}} six Wright T35 turboprops with a gross weight of 360,000pounds (160,000kg) and a combat radius of 3,110miles (2,700nmi, 5,010km), was declared the winner. On 28 June 1946, Boeing was issued {{a letter of}} contract for US$1.7million to build a full-scale <b>mock-up</b> of the new XB-52 and do preliminary engineering and testing. However, by October 1946, the air force began to express concern about {{the sheer size of}} the new aircraft and its inability to meet the specified design requirements. In response, Boeing produced Model 464, a smaller four-engine version with a 230,000pound (105,000kg) gross weight, which was briefly deemed acceptable.|$|E

40|$|Designing usable smart {{products}} is a multidisciplinary effort {{that requires people}} with very diverse knowledge to collaborate. Collaboration is challenging because knowledge from various design stakeholders with different needs and constraints has to be integrated in a design. Design <b>mock-ups</b> are used by designers to facilitate the collaboration. Design <b>mock-ups</b> help integrate different perspectives because they evoke {{different things to different}} stakeholders and help them negotiate the limits within which they can agree on a design. Literature suggests the analytical boundary object concept as a theory to explain how <b>mock-ups</b> support the integration of knowledge in design collaboration. I review the literature on the boundary object concept and iterate it with the data collected from a one year ethnographic study of a multidisciplinary product development project to design a smart usable device. I discuss that the boundary object concept fails to conceptualize how <b>mock-ups</b> support negotiation and suggest the concept of dynamic boundary objects as a more appropriate concept for the role of mockups in design collaboration. Design <b>mock-ups</b> iteratively support the boundary negotiation activities of self-explanation, inclusion, compilation and structuring. They act as a scaffold {{for the creation of a}} shared understanding...|$|R

40|$|Abstract ? The {{objective}} of this work was to build <b>mock-ups</b> of complete yerba mate plants in several stages of development, using the InterpolMate software, and to compute photosynthesis on the interpolated structure. The <b>mock-ups</b> of yerba-mate were first built in the VPlants software for three growth stages. Male and female plants grown in two contrasting environments (monoculture and forest understory) were considered. To model the dynamic 3 D architecture of yerba-mate plants during the biennial growth interval between two subsequent prunings, data sets of branch development collected in 38 dates were used. The estimated values obtained from the <b>mock-ups,</b> including leaf photosynthesis and sexual dimorphism, {{are very close to}} those observed in the field. However, this similarity was limited to reconstructions that included growth units from original data sets. The modeling of growth dynamics enables the estimation of photosynthesis for the entire yerba mate plant, which is not easily measurable in the field. The InterpolMate software is efficient for building yerba mate <b>mock-ups.</b> 201...|$|R
