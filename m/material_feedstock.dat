In this study, Nd-Fe-B magnets were fabricated by powder {{injection molding}}, in which the injection residues (gates, sprue and surplus green samples) were reprocessed, up to 6 times. Subsequently, samples underwent binder extraction by chemical and thermal procedures, being finally sintered under high vacuum. Physical characterizations were carried out and the magnetic properties were measured via B-H trace analysis in each batch to study the influence of the recycled feedstock on the magnetic properties of produced samples.

Fine TiO 2 Degussa P 25 nanopowder, generally considered as the reference material in photocatalytic applications, was used as the <b>material</b> <b>feedstock.</b> HVOF process and suspension thermal spraying were used to prepare photocatalytic titania coatings. The coatings were mainly characterised by means of SEM and X-ray diffraction. The photocatalytic performance was evaluated based on decolouration of the pink dye Rhodamine B and degradation of gaseous acetaldehyde. A lower degree of pollutant degradation was found for deposits prepared by HVOF spraying of granules due principally to the low content of the photocatalytically active phase, i. e. anatase. Complete photocatalytic degradation of the organic compounds was recorded for the suspension-sprayed coatings. Based on the current results, suspension thermal spraying appears to be the better choice for preparing photocatalytically active titanium oxide surfaces for the removal of organic pollutants...|$|E

The C&D wood waste composed of lumber, plywood, particleboard, and medium density fiberboard (MDF) had polysaccharide (cellulose, xylan, and glucomannan) fractions of 60. 7 - 67. 9 %.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. The {{conversion}} of cellulosic material from linear form to monomer is the rate-limiting step in current biofuels production technologies from lignocellulosic material. The renewed focus on clean, sustainable, carbon-neutral fuels {{has resulted in}} increased interest in novel cellulolytic enzymes and microbial strains, with the aim {{to increase the efficiency}} of the above conversion. However, the availability of suitable cellulolytic enzymes has been restricted by the limited number of cellulolytic microbial strains in which these enzymes can be procured. One approach to increase efficiency has been to bioprospect novel thermophilic microbial strains, the logic being that an increase in production temperature will result in increased rates of lignocellulosic hydrolysis. Unfortunately, microbiologists have had limited success in cultivating cellulolytic thermophiles with {{only a small number of}} strains isolated. The goal of this project was to circumvent the need to cultivate cellulolytic thermophiles by applying a metatranscriptomic approach to discover new thermostable cellulases commonly referred to as glycoside hydrolases (GH-enzymes that hydrolyze the glycosidic linkages between sugar molecules). This was achieved by employing a novel in situ enrichment technique to enrich for thermostable GHs directly from a geothermal environment. These GHs were being actively expressed by the resident microbial population to hydrolyse lignocellulose. This approach not only eliminated the need for cultivation, but also selected for the actively expressed GHs unregulated in response to the lignocellulosic <b>material</b> <b>feedstock.</b> This strategy removed the emphasis on identifying potentially relevant and substrate-active GHs from genomic data via genomic analysis of a cultivated microorganism or from environmental metagenomic surveys...|$|E

This project’s objective is to optimize the material selection and 3 D printing conditions for two different material sets: carbon nanotube (CNT) -filled polylactic acid (PLA) composites and ceramics. The first part of this thesis explores the inclusion of CNTs in PLA to improve the mechanical and thermal properties of the 3 D printed parts.
