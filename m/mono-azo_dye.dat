40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to compare the efficiency of biological and chemical-physical treatments for the removal of organic azo dyes in the textile wastewater. Regarding the biological reduction of the wastewater colour the anaerobic/aerobic (ANA/AER) sequential step-treatment provides the best reductions in colour and COD. A lab-scale Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) fed with synthetic wastewater and <b>mono-azo</b> <b>dye</b> (at the initial concentration of 25 mg/l) was used achieving 84 % colour reduction and 82 % COD removal. Chemical-physical treatments were performed using the oxidative method with Fenton's reagent and adsorption on the activated carbon achieving respectively colour reduction over 90 % (from the initial concentration of 250 mg/l) and 155 mg col/g GAC total adsorption capacity (from the initial concentration of 1 g/l) ...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the biological removal of organic azo dyes by using a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR). Further objectives were to achieve reductions in Ammonia and COD in the effluent wastewater. Anaerobic and aerobic treatment systems could be both effective in reducing the wastewater colour; however, anaerobic treatment generally produced the greatest colour removal. Anaerobic/aerobic (ANA/AER) sequential step-treatment could provide the best reductions in colour, ammonia and COD. A lab-scale SBR fed with synthetic wastewater and <b>mono-azo</b> <b>dye</b> was set in laboratory in order to perform some experimental runs. A first experimental run was performed with only aerobic phase, to acclimate the microorganisms and to study the colour adsorption on the biomass.

30|$|Methyl red (MR) dye is a {{commonly}} used <b>mono-azo</b> <b>dye</b> in laboratory assays, textiles and other commercial products; however, it may cause eye and skin sensitization (Chung et al. 1981) and pharyngeal or digestive tract irritation if inhaled or swallowed (So et al. 1990). Furthermore, MR is mutagenic under aerobic conditions: it undergoes biotransformation into 2 -aminobenzoic acid and N,N′-dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine (Wong and Yuen 1998; Vijaya and Sandhya 2003; Jadhav et al. 2008). It became imperative to develop low-cost adsorbent {{for the removal}} of MR dye from wastewater before being discharged into receiving water body. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the adsorption performance of locally derived adsorbent from durian seeds {{for the removal of}} MR dye from aqueous solutions. Adsorption equilibrium and kinetics were determined. Eight different isotherm equations were employed to quantify the adsorption equilibrium. The effects of solution pH, initial dye concentration and temperature on MR dye adsorption were also examined.|$|E

Two substitution patterns were analyzed: (i) all possible substitution patterns of the two methyl and hydroxy substitution groups, 2 -hydroxy (3, 5; 4, 5; 5, 6) dimethyl and 4 -hydroxy (2, 3; 2, 5; 2, 6; 3, 5) dimethyl isomers of azobenzene 4 (prm 1) -sulfonic acid; and (ii) replacement of the sulfonic group with a carboxylic group in these sulfonated azo dyes. The structural pattern of the hydroxy group in para position relative to the azo linkage and of two methyl substitution groups in ortho position relative to the hydroxy group was the most susceptible to degradation. Replacement of the sulfonic group with a carboxylic group enhanced overall dye degradability by S. chromofuscus A 11...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Azo dyes {{that are}} {{extensively}} used in textile industries are recalcitrant xenobiotic compounds causing a serious {{damage to the}} environment. Degradation of azo dyes being a necessity diverse dye dumped soils were screened for dye degrading yeasts. One efficient yeast isolate capable of decolorizing both <b>mono-azo</b> <b>dyes</b> and di-azo dyes was selected, immobilized by entrapment method and studied for decolorization efficiency. The isolate was morphologically, culturally and biochemically identified as Saccharomyces sp. Sodium alginate entrapped yeast cells were studied for decolorization of commercially available textile dyes having azo groups. The extent of colour removal in the culture medium was assessed through the decrease in dye absorbance of the supernatants. The immobilized yeast’s decolorization abilities were different and varied with inoculum size, incubation time and nutrients like carbon and nitrogen sources. The fermentation conditions like pH, temperature and aeration had no profound effect. The decolorization ranged from 70 - 100 %. Complete decolorization was seen within 12 and 18 hrs depending on inoculum size. The immobilized beads with yeasts could be reused efficiently for three cycles. The dye degrading immobilized Saccharomyces isolate could be commercially significant as it is efficiently degrading both <b>mono-azo</b> and di-azo <b>dyes,</b> different dye waste waters in a semi-continuous manner and so {{could also be used}} for detoxification of industrial effluents...|$|R
30|$|Textile {{manufacturing}} involves several processes which generate {{large quantities}} of wastewaters. These effluents are highly variable in composition with relatively low biochemical oxygen demand and high chemical oxygen demand contents and are typically characterized as follow: first: strong color due to residual dyes, second: recalcitrance due {{to the presence of}} compounds such as dyes, surfactants, and sizing agents; and third: high salinity, high temperature, and variable pH [1 – 3]. The textile effluents effective treatment usually requires a combination of various physical, chemical, and biological technologies. Some studies researched the treatment of model solutions containing various commercial dyes with emphasis on azo dyes since these are extensively used in dyeing processes. These azo dye molecules are chemically stable and hardly biodegradable aerobically. Most attention has been paid on the oxidative degradation of MB and MO representative <b>mono-azo</b> <b>dyes</b> by oxidation processes [4, 5]. TiO 2 is the most widely used photocatalyst far effective decomposition of organic compounds in air and water under irradiation of UV light with wavelength shorter than corresponding to its band gap energy, due to its relatively high photocatalytic activity, biological and chemical stability, low cost, non-toxic nature, and long-term stability. However, the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 (the band gap of anatase TiO 2 is 3.2 eV and it can be excited by photons with wavelengths below 387 nm) is limited to irradiation wavelengths in the UV region [6, 7]. However, only about 3 % to 5 % of the solar spectrum falls in this UV range. This limits the efficient utilization of solar energy for TiO 2. Some problems still remain to be solved in its application, such as the fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Therefore, improving photocatalytic activity by modification has become a hot topic among researchers in recent years [8, 9].|$|R
40|$|The <b>mono-azo</b> <b>dye</b> Reactive Red 195 (RR 195) is {{a widely}} used color {{compound}} in the textile industry. As many other colors, it is persistent and difficult {{to be removed from}} water with conventional processes. The present study investigates biological decolorization of RR 195 under alternate anaerobic-aerobic conditions in a laboratory scale Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) containing a mixed culture and fed with a biodegradable carbon source. Different values of the Sludge Retention Time (SRT), Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), influent color and organic carbon loadings were adopted during the experimental activity and their effects on color and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal efficiencies and process kinetics determined. The optimal operating conditions were found to be: 800 mgl- 1 influent COD, 50 d SRT and a 24 h-cycle. Under these conditions, the maximum color efficiency of 97 % was achieved for a 40 mgl- 1 RR 195 in the feed. Some inhibition was present at influent color loadings above 40 mgl- 1, which was confirmed by the application of the Haldane model. © 2010 Elsevier B. V...|$|E

30|$|A {{low-cost}} biosorbent prepared from dead fungal biomass of R. arrhizus NCIM 997 {{was successfully}} {{applied for the}} removal of RO 13 dye, a reactive <b>mono-azo</b> <b>dye</b> from aqueous solution using sequential optimization strategy. The statistical approach consisting of Plackett–Burman design, path of steepest ascent and central composite design helped in rapidly identifying important factors, studying the interactions between them and determining their optimum levels. Development of a polynomial model showed significant results for optimizing biosorption conditions for the RO 13 dye. This study clearly showed that the RSM is an effective tool for optimization of process parameters to maximize the dye removal. The optimum values of pH, dye concentration, biosorbent dosage and speed of agitation were found to be 2.0, 0.8  g/L, 114.0  mg/L and 85  rpm {{for the removal of}} RO 13 dye, respectively. The experimental values were in good agreement with the model-predicted values. ANN results showed that neural network modeling could effectively simulate and predict the behavior of the process. Optimal conditions obtained in this experiment have laid a solid foundation for further use of this microorganism in the treatment of reactive azo dyes containing effluents.|$|E
30|$|Application of dead fungal biomass {{obtained}} from R. arrhizus to remove textile dyes from {{industrial waste water}} is attractive due to its cheap and constant supply from industrial fermentation processes, high removal rates, easy storage and regenerative potential [11]. Some researchers have demonstrated the high dye binding capacity of R. arrhizus which exceeds that of some commercial ion exchange resins or activated carbon [19, 20, 21]. Hence, the main objective {{of the present study}} was to apply RSM and ANN approach for techno-economical optimization of the removal of Reactive Orange 13 (RO 13) <b>dye,</b> a <b>mono-azo</b> reactive <b>dye</b> from an aqueous solution using the dead biomass of R. arrhizus NCIM 997 as a low-cost biosorbent. In this study, the optimum value of the parameters and interactions between factors that influence the removal of RO 13 dye were determined. RO 13 was chosen in this study due to its extensive use in Indian textile industry for dyeing and printing cotton, viscose, silk, wool and nylon fabric.|$|R
40|$|The {{fastness}} of wool dyes to washing {{varies widely}} {{not only among}} different classes of dyes but even among members of a given class. These variations are manifestations {{of the differences in}} affinities of the dyestuffs for the fibers. A possible basis for understanding such differences in affinities was described in two earlier papers in which it was shown that wool immersed in hydro-chloric acid solutions combines not only with hydrogen ions but with chloride ions as well. As a consequence of this, it appeared that the affinities for wool of the anions of different acids might vary considerably and that therefore the positions of the titration curves with respect to the pH axis might vary by correspondingly large amounts, according to the acid used. The determination of the titration curve of wool with a gvien acid could then be used to measure the affinity of the anion of the acid for the fiber. Measurements have therefore been made by Research Associates of the Textile Foundation at the National Bureau of Standards of the combination of wool with nineteen different acids, including, in addition to some of the common mineral acids, several of the simpler aromatic sulfonic, carboxylic, and phenolic acids and a soluble <b>mono-azo</b> acid <b>dye.</b> Wide {{differences were found between the}} positions of the resulting nineteen titration curves. A gen-eralized form of the equations previously developed to account for the effect of the concentration of chloride ion on the amounts of hydrochloric acid combined was utilized to calculate the affinity for wool of each of seventeen anions involved. Predictions, based on the equations, as to the effects of variations of anion concentrations and of temperature were tested and confirmed...|$|R
40|$|The <b>mono-azo</b> <b>dye,</b> Orange II, {{solution}} was substantially degraded with cast iron particles under varied conditions of experimental {{variables such as}} pH, initial dye concentration and cast iron dosage. At all solution pH studied, the degradation efficiency achieved was> 90 %. With an initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L and optimum cast iron load of 28. 56 g/L, the optimum degradation efficiency of 97. 63 % was achieved at pH 3. With same cast iron load and solution pH, more than 95 % dye degradation efficiency was achieved at different initial Orange II concentrations ranging from 50 - 500 mg/L. The efficiency of cast iron particles in degrading Orange II dye was {{compared with that of}} pure elemental iron used in other study. Cast iron particles showed better degradation efficiencies than elemental iron that too at relatively lower dosages. Ultimately, from the results it can be inferred that cast iron fillings can be successfully applied to treat textile effluents containing high dye concentration and treatment efficiency can be enhanced by optimizing the reaction conditions.

40|$|The <b>mono-azo</b> <b>dye,</b> Orange-II (acid orange 7), {{is mainly}} used to dye {{materials}} like textiles, paper, leather and cosmetics. It {{is important to}} understand the kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the oxidative decolourisation of Orange-II dye. A simple, efficient and cost-effective oxidation method is developed for the reaction. A detailed kinetic study of the oxidative decolourisation of orange-II dye with chloramine-T (CAT) in alkaline medium at 308 K has been carried out spectrophotometrically at 486 nm. The reaction shows a first-order dependence of rate both on CAT o and Orange-II o and an inverse-fractional- order on OH-. The reaction was studied at different temperatures and the thermodynamic parameters have been evaluated. The reaction was subjected to change in (i) ionic strength, (ii) p-toluenesulfonamide and (iii) chloride ions, and the effects of these on the reaction rate were determined. Oxidation products of Orange-II were characterised as 1, 2 -naphthaquinone and benzenesulfonic acid by GC-MS analysis. The observed kinetic results have been explained by a general mechanism to understand the elementary pathways of this redox system. The relevant kinetic modelling has been worked out.

40|$|Ethyl orange (EO) is a <b>mono-azo</b> <b>dye,</b> {{which is}} chiefly {{used as a}} dye in textile, food, and {{cosmetic}} industries. Removal of this dye from wastewater generated by these industries is a main concern in wastewater treatment. Hence, {{there is a need}} for a simple and inexpensive method to abolish this dye present in wastewater. A search through literature revealed that very few reports are available on the decolorization of EO dye and also no kinetic and mechanistic studies have been carried out about this dye. Consequently, an attempt is made to develop an oxidative decolorization method for EO dye with chloramine-T (CAT). The present study also aims to investigate the kinetics and mechanism of oxidative decolorization of EO dye with CAT in HClO 4 medium spectrophotometrically (Î»max= 474 Â nm) at 303 Â K. The reaction exhibits a first-order dependence of rate on EOoand fractional-order dependence, each on CAToand H+, respectively. The dielectric effect is positive. Activation parameters have been deduced. Oxidation products were identified as N-(4 -diethylamino-phenyl) -hydroxyamine and 4 -nitroso-benzenesulfonic acid. Suitable mechanism and related rate law have been worked out. Importantly, the present decolorization method is definitely an advantageous alternative technique in treating the EO dye present in wastewater. Â© 2014 Balaban Desalination Publications.

40|$|This {{research}} project - {{that is part}} of a broader {{research project}}, carried out in collaboration with the University of Turin (Department of Vegetal Biology, Dr. Cristina Varese and financed by the “Compagnia di S. Paolo”) - aims at developing bio-systems for the treatment of industrial coloured wastewaters, based on microbial and enzymatic catalysts. In the present research program two kind of biosystems have been specifically analysed: Streptomyces spp. bacteria and laccase isoenzymes produced by the white rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus. Their effectiveness was tested on four textile wastewater models (Acid Bath, Optional Acid, Direct, Reactive) and single dyes composing them, by assessing and comparing their performances in terms of decolourisation ability of the treated effluent. In particular, the decolourization ability of eleven Streptomyces spp. strains has been tested towards single dyes and the four wastewater models. Since the analysed strains originate from soil contaminated by gasoil their expanded metabolic capabilities can be considered a promising starting point for the selection of new dye degraders. The best performing Streptomyces spp. strains have shown good decolourization abilities (percentage up to 50 %), although the process is mainly ascribable to absorption processes instead of degradation ones. However, according to the obtained data, these biomasses may stand out as good candidates for biosorption treatment of industrial wastewaters. As far as the enzymatic system, decolouration ability of recombinant laccases from Pleurotus ostreatus has been analyzed. In order to ascertain the contribution of single laccase isoenzyme to the decolourization process, and to identify the most efficient laccase based biosystem, the decolourization ability of the single P. ostraetus laccase isoenzymes POXA 1 b, POXC and POXA 3, heterologously expressed in the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, has been tested towards the four wastewater models. The data indicate laccases preference in decolourizing anthraquinonic type dye and aniline <b>mono-azo</b> <b>dye,</b> characteristics of Acid wastewater models. In particular recombinant POXC laccase displays a slightly higher decolourization ability against Acid Bath, reaching up to 22 % decolourization after 24 h, in comparison with POXA 3 and POXA 1 b. The differences in decolourization efficiency can be ascribed to structural differences of the dyes and to substrate specificity of the laccase isoenzymes. A parallel aspect of this section has been focused on selecting laccase variants that are better suited to the conditions of industrial wastewaters (high pHs, heterogeneous composition), i. e able to operate on a wider range of substrates, or stable, and especially active, in extreme conditions of pH. For this reason, seven POXA 1 b variants, previously selected from a collection of mutants on the basis of different criteria (increased activity toward different substrates and higher stability at pHs and temperature), have been tested for their decolourization ability towards the four wastewater models. Selected POXA 1 b variants show an increased decolourization ability than POXA 1 b wild-type toward the Acid Bath model. As a fact, for all the mutants, a two-fold increase in decolourization percentage compared to that of POXA 1 b has been obtained. Another section of the work has been focused on the understanding of the structure/function relationships of laccases with the aim to characterize molecular determinants of the activity of these enzymes, and to develop and characterize new laccases obtained from rational design using POXA 1 b P. ostreatus isoenzyme. Rational mutants of POXA 1 b laccase allowed to demonstrate a role of the C-terminal tail of POXA 1 b in affecting its catalytic and stability properties. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis experiments allowed to demonstrate that introducing Arg 205 mutation, instead of Asp 205, in a highly conserved region perturbs the structural local environment in POXA 1 b, leading to a large rearrangement of the enzyme structure. Hence, a single substitution in the binding site introduces a local conformational change that not only leads to very different catalytic properties, but can also significantly destabilize the protein. Finally, in order to improve industrially useful enzymatic biosystems, suitable for decolourization processes of coloured wastewaters, the last session of the project was aimed at producing new P. ostreatus dikaryotic strains with improved efficiencies in laccase expression, by classical breeding approach. In particular, starting from two different P. ostreatus variants, three laccase higher-producing dikaryotic strains have been obtained by crossing compatible characterized monokaryons. The three selected strains reached expression levels of 100, 000 U/L, increasing the trite of parental strains up to four folds. Moreover, a new laccase isoenzyme, POX 1, has been produced and identified in these culture conditions...|$|E
