The Romanian author himself noted that this had been <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> intercession of François Lebrun, the Bucharest correspondent of Le Matin newspaper, whom he considered a personal friend.|$|E
5|$|Perl {{poetry is}} the {{practice}} of writing poems that can be compiled as legal Perl code, for example the piece known as Black Perl.

5|$|Yarrell {{was aware}} of earlier bird handbooks, {{especially}} Bewick's. A History of British Birds used the same title as Bewick's popular book (1797–1804). Its approach, however, was significantly different in the extensiveness of Yarrell's correspondence and in the increased emphasis on scientific accuracy <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rapid advance in ornithological knowledge in the nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Most non-Republican Guard armored units had older tank designs, {{mainly the}} T-55 or its Chinese equivalents, the Type 59 and Type 69. The {{remaining}} 34 divisions were composed of poorly trained conscripts. These divisions were deployed to channel the Coalition's forces {{through a number}} of break points along the front, allowing the Iraqi Army's heavy divisions and the Republican Guard units to isolate them and counterattack. However, the Iraqis left their western flank open, failing to account for tactics <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Global Positioning System and other new technologies.|$|E

5|$|Preservation of most {{specimens}} was <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fast sedimentation {{that quickly}} cut the organism off from seawater; {{it may also}} have been enhanced by the decay products of the rotting organism, which could have helped the overlying sediment to mineralise and harden. It has been suggested that a mucus trail produced by the organism may have assisted its preservation, but experiments suggest that mucus disintegrates too easily {{to play a role in}} binding sediment together.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{familiar}} form of cellular signaling is synaptic transmission, whereby a nerve impulse that has {{reached the end of}} one neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters. This transmission is <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> action of synaptic vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released. These vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.|$|E
5|$|Some of Van Rensselaer's {{success as}} a jewel {{merchant}} came about due to trade <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dutch East India Company.

5|$|The Itzas' {{continued}} resistance {{had become}} a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpetén once and for all. The final assault was <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> gradual opening of the road from Mérida to Petén; by December 1696 this road had reached the lake shore although it was unfinished and still almost impassable in places. By this time the deep divisions between the political leaders of the Itza were such that a unified defence of the Itza kingdom had become impossible.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Switzerland under Roman rule was, from the Augustan period up until 260AD, {{a time of}} {{exceptional}} peace and prosperity. The Pax Romana was <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> protection of well-defended and distant Imperial borders and a peaceful and smooth Romanization of the local population. The Romans urbanized the territory with numerous settlements and built a network of high-quality Roman roads connecting them, allowing for the integration of Helvetia into the imperial economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the U.S. state of Minnesota is shaped by its {{original}} Native American residents, European exploration and settlement, {{and the emergence of}} industries <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> state's natural resources. Minnesota achieved prominence through fur trading, logging, and farming, and later through railroads, and iron mining. While those industries remain important, the state's economy is now driven by banking, computers, and health care.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{success of}} flex {{vehicles}} was <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> existence of 33,000 filling stations {{with at least}} one ethanol pump available by 2006, a heritage of the early Pró-Álcool ethanol program. These facts, together with the mandatory use of E25 blend of gasoline throughout the country, allowed Brazil in 2008 to achieve more than 50% of fuel consumption in the gasoline market from sugar cane-based ethanol.|$|E

50|$|To {{improve the}} service, more {{infrastructure}} projects were undertaken {{to extend the}} line to Salé and on to Kénitra, which was <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> doubling <b>the</b> line between them (in 1992) and constructing a tunnel at Rabat Agdal (in 1996).|$|R

5|$|A {{systemic}} transformation happening {{sooner rather}} than later was <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Polish legislative elections of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protesters in China. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the Sejm, while in the newly established Senate they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (the other seat went to an independent, who later switched to Solidarity). At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them. The communists suffered a catastrophic blow to their legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which was <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, {{reducing the number of}} boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more {{power in the hands of}} the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E
30|$|Nezhat et al.
