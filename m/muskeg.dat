5|$|Highway 60 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with Highway 11 in Huntsville. It crosses through central Ontario in a generally east–west orientation. The triangle-shaped area bounded by Highways 11, 17 and 60 is largely uninhabited wilderness dotted with lakes and <b>muskeg.</b>|$|E
5|$|North of Highway554, {{the route}} is {{generally}} {{parallel to the}} river and Mississagi River Provincial Park. After passing west of Wakomata Lake on its journey through completely undeveloped forest and <b>muskeg,</b> it reaches a junction with Highway556 southwest of Aubrey Falls Provincial Park. Thereafter, the highway roughly follows the Wenebegon River through Wenebegon River Provincial Park to Wenebegon Lake. Highway129 encounters the entrance to Five Mile Provincial Park and meets Highway667, which travels east through Sultan, becoming the Sultan Industrial Road and connecting with Highway144.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, Admiral Kinkaid {{requested}} a larger force of 25,000 troops {{to support an}} assault on Kiska. However, as there were not enough ships to transport such a large division to the Aleutians, Kinkaid suggested that the Americans' objective change from Kiska, which was defended by about 9,000 men, to Attu, which was home to only 500 Japanese. On April 1, Kinkaid received approval from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to execute the operation, codenamed SANDCRAB. The terrain of Attu Island was not hospitable for such an operation – much of the island's landmass not covered in snowy peaks was covered in <b>muskeg,</b> a marshy soil type that {{is almost impossible to}} cross by foot. In addition, Attu Island was subject to frequent storms and soupy fogs.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} {{relatively}} flat with numerous <b>muskegs.</b> The highest point is Crystal Mountain 3317 ft.|$|R
5000|$|In {{oil and gas}} exploration, the Land Tamer is able {{to travel}} over adverse terrain, such as <b>muskegs</b> and swamps to service natural gas well heads that could {{normally}} only be accessed by helicopter.|$|R
6000|$|The tired man {{shook his}} head. [...] "We'll strike for water, {{and if we}} can't find a canoe {{anywhere}} {{you can build a}} raft. I wouldn't crawl through any more of those <b>muskegs</b> for a thousand dollars." ...|$|R
25|$|In 2003, Shell Canada and its {{partners}} began producing from the <b>Muskeg</b> River Mine, located 75 kilometres north of Fort McMurray. Known as the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, the entire complex consists of <b>Muskeg</b> River, Shell's Scotford Upgrader located near Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, and supporting facilities.|$|E
25|$|The region {{consists}} of aspen parkland in the south, grading to boreal forest and <b>muskeg</b> in the north.|$|E
25|$|On November18, 1931, {{construction}} was accelerated between Madoc and Perth {{as a major}} depression-relief project when eight contracts were set to build the new route. Over 2700 men blasted rock, dredged <b>muskeg</b> and endured a constant barrage of blood-sucking insects in order to construct this new link. The majority of it followed along a Canadian Pacific right-of-way (now abandoned past the town of Havelock) which had been cleared in 1881, deviating at times to provide a better alignment, avoid large <b>muskeg</b> or to lessen excavation work, most of which was performed by hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't get around--the <b>muskeg's</b> too soft. I'd put you down, {{only that}} I {{may not be}} able to hold the team after we get past that machine." [...] He raised his voice. [...] "Can't you stop her, boys?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, {{with the}} color {{in her face}} and sympathy in her eyes, [...] "I wish you good luck. But be careful up there among the rocks and <b>muskegs.</b> Don't run too many risks. Come back safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] Benson agreed, [...] "We {{would be}} sure of {{striking}} the Stony village, and we could afterward follow the low ground {{right down to the}} river. With the <b>muskegs</b> frozen solid, it ought to make an easy road." ...|$|R
25|$|Manitoba has {{an extreme}} climate, but {{southern}} latitudes allow agriculture. The northern {{area of the}} region ranges from coniferous forests to <b>muskeg</b> to tundra in the far north. Before settlement had occurred, a vast portion of southern Manitoba was either flood plain or swamp. An extensive system for drainage ditches was required throughout south-central Manitoba to make the region suitable for cultivation.|$|E
25|$|In some {{particular}} circumstances the government considers agricultural land to be equivalent to forest land. Oil sands companies have reclaimed mined land {{to use as}} pasture for wood bison instead of restoring it to the original boreal forest and <b>muskeg.</b> Syncrude asserts they have reclaimed 22% of their disturbed land, a figure disputed by other sources, who assess Syncrude more accurately reclaimed only 0.2% of its disturbed land.|$|E
25|$|By 2013 {{there were}} nine oil sands mining {{projects}} in the Athabasca oil sands deposit: Suncor Energy Inc. (Suncor), Syncrude Canada Limited (Syncrude)'s Mildred Lake and Aurora North, Shell Canada Limited (Shell)'s <b>Muskeg</b> River and Jackpine, Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL), Horizon, Imperial Oil Resources Ventures Limited (Imperial), Kearl Oil Sands Project (KOSP), Total E Canada Ltd. Joslyn North Mine and Fort Hills Energy Corporation (FHEC). In 2011 alone they produced over 52 million cubic metres of bitumen.|$|E

5000|$|The {{area is a}} part of the Southern Boreal EcoRegion {{with the}} Northern Boreal EcoRegion to the north and the Parkland EcoRegion on the south. The {{neighbouring}} rural areas include Trembling aspen Populus tremuloides, White spruce Picea glauca, Jack Pine Pinus banksiana, Black Spruce Picea mariana and <b>muskegs</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Introductory {{statement}} - Prospecting for ore minerals {{is often}} carried on {{by examining the}} bedrock at or very near the earth’s surface. The bedrock, however, over {{large areas of the}} earth, is covered by layers of material called overburden. It has been demonstrated that under certain conditions the bedrock can be examined indirectly by chemical analyses of the soils or plants covering it. Canada, particularly in the north, has large areas covered by deposits in the form of peat bogs or <b>muskegs.</b> The examination of bedrock under peat bogs or <b>muskegs</b> by chemical analyses has not been practised in Canada, but it has been tried with some success in Finland. The present study was organized under the name “Operation Muskeg” to be carried out by a team of geologists and a botanist from McGill University...|$|R
25|$|It {{was headed}} by British {{explorer}} Dr Vivian Fuchs, with New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary leading the New Zealand Ross Sea Support team. After spending {{the winter of}} 1957 at Shackleton Base, Fuchs finally {{set out on the}} transcontinental journey in November 1957, with a twelve-man team travelling in six vehicles; three Sno-Cats, two Weasels and one specially adapted <b>Muskeg</b> tractor. On route, the team were also tasked with carrying out scientific research including seismic soundings and gravimetric readings.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of oil sands mines are {{currently}} in operation and more are in the stages of approval or development. The Syncrude Canada mine was the second to open in 1978, Shell Canada opened its <b>Muskeg</b> River mine (Albian Sands) in 2003 and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNRL) opened its Horizon Oil Sands project in 2009. Newer mines include Shell Canada's Jackpine mine, Imperial Oil's Kearl Oil Sands Project, the Synenco Energy (now owned by Total S.A.) Northern Lights mine, and Suncor's Fort Hills mine.|$|E
25|$|Kee-too-way-how ("Sounding With Flying Wings", {{better known}} as Alexander Cayen dit Boudreau, Chief of the Parklands or Willow Cree at <b>Muskeg</b> Lake, born 1834 St. Boniface, Manitoba, son of Pierre Narcisse Cayen dit Boudreau and Adelaide Catherine Arcand ("Kaseweetin"), though he was of Métis descent he became chief of the Willow Cree and the Métis, who were living with the Cree, brother of Petequakey ("Isidore Cayen dit Boudreau"), lived along Duck Lake, signed 1876 Treaty 6 and settled in a reserve at <b>Muskeg</b> Lake - that was later named after his brother Petequakey - but left the reserve in 1880 and lived again in the {{following}} years close to St. Laurent de Grandin mission, played a prominent role during the Northwest Rebellion of 1885 in which he participated in every battle, served also as an emissary of the Métis leader Gabriel Dumont to ask the Assiniboine for support, on 23 May 1885 he also submitted the declaration of surrender of Pitikwahanapiwiyin ('Poundmaker') to General Middleton, was captured on 1 June 1885, in the subsequent trial of Kee-too-way-how at Regina, Louis Cochin testified {{that he and the}} carters in the camp of Pitikwahanapiwiyin survived only thanks to the intercession by Kee-way-too-how and its people, despite the positive testimony, he was on 14 August 1885 sentenced to imprisonment for seven years for his involvement in the Métis rebellion, died 1886).|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{meant to}} look into the Snake Creek <b>muskegs,</b> but the cold drove me back," [...] he said. [...] "In summer one's bitten by sand-flies and mosquitoes; in winter one runs some risk of {{freezing}} to death. I wonder now and then whether mining's worth the hardship and why we stop here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Much easier," [...] said Graham. [...] "The {{railroad}} {{has opened}} up the country, and the Company finds miners very good customers. Only, {{when you get back}} a short distance from the track, the North is still unsubdued. To grapple with its snow and ice, its rapids and <b>muskegs,</b> is mighty tough work." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{lowlands}} of the Canadian Shield {{have a very}} dense {{soil that}} is not suitable for forestation; it also contains many marshes and bogs (<b>muskegs).</b> The rest of the region has coarse soil that does not retain moisture well and is frozen with permafrost throughout the year. Forests are not as dense in the north.|$|R
25|$|Highway523 {{begins at}} the {{boundary}} between the Hastings County and Nipissing District, east of Algonquin Provincial Park. From here the road continues south as the Madawaska Road to Maynooth, where it meets the Peterson Road and Hastings Road, all former Colonization Roads which served to open the northern frontier to settlement in the 1850s. North of the boundary, the Highway begins and is known as Cross Lake Road. It passes through a sparsely populated region dotted with lakes and <b>muskeg,</b> generally remaining straight, though curving sporadically to avoid the many obstacles presented by the Canadian Shield.|$|E
25|$|The highway travels north straight-as-an-arrow towards Lake Nipissing, with {{forests to}} the east and a mix of forests and {{pastures}} to the west. It turns east and crosses a <b>muskeg</b> approximately two kilometres (1.25miles) south of the lake, then enters the municipality of Callander. As it travels eastward towards Callander Bay, the highway serves numerous residences and the occasional farm. It dips south to avoid the bay then encounters the southern terminus of Highway94 before ending at an interchange with Highway11. The road continues beyond Highway 11 as Lake Nosbonsing Road for several more kilometres, but this segment is not classified as a provincial highway.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{promises}} of fertile land in this new northern tract of wilderness proved false. Beneath thin layers of sparsely spread soil was solid granite. Where this granite descended deeper, valleys formed and filled with <b>muskeg.</b> Despite an early influx of settlers, {{the vast majority of}} grants were abandoned {{by the turn of the}} century; only 40% remained. During the first half of the 1900s, many of these colonization roads were incorporated into the growing provincial highway network. Some sections were improved to modern highway standards, while others were subsequently bypassed or abandoned. The roads that were not incorporated as highways either became local roads or were consumed by nature.|$|E
60|$|Jardine, however, was obstinate {{and for an}} hour or two {{he pushed}} across soft <b>muskegs</b> and through tangled brushwood. When at length he stopped he saw he had torn his new {{overalls}} and broken an old long boot. Besides, he hated to be baffled and since he could not catch the oxen he could not move some logs.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's this--I suspect Clarke {{intended}} {{us to get}} entangled among these <b>muskegs</b> where we'd have no chance of renewing our provisions, and misled us about the Stony village, which he didn't wish us to reach. Well, he has succeeded in getting us into trouble {{and now he has}} to help us out. The fellow is a doctor." ...|$|R
60|$|Thirlwell made {{a sign of}} agreement. Rivers {{and lakes}} are {{numerous}} in the North, and in winter one can travel smoothly on the ice. When the latter rots and cracks, voyageurs and prospectors wait until the melting snow sweeps the grinding floes away and canoes can be launched. To push through tangled bush and across soft <b>muskegs</b> costs heavy labor.|$|R
25|$|In Northern Alberta, oil {{development}} activities bring {{an enormous number}} of people into a fragile ecosystem. Historically, population figures have been very low for this region. Water is easily polluted because the water table reaches the surface in most areas of <b>muskeg.</b> With the ever-increasing development and extraction of resources, wildlife are recipient to both direct and indirect effects of pollution. Woodland Caribou are particularly sensitive to human activities, and as such are pushed away from their preferred habitat during {{the time of year when}} their caloric needs are greatest and food is the most scarce. Humans' effect on the Caribou is compounded by road construction and habitat fragmentation that open the area up to deer and wolves.|$|E
25|$|The beavers dam small streams {{throughout}} Saskatchewan. The muskrat and beaver were {{exploited for}} their fur and beaver pelts. Beavers are still trapped for the fur trade industry and were almost extirpated {{in the first}} half of the 20th century. The Mid-Boreal Upland ecoregion within the Boreal Plains Ecozone features white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and the other mammals of the northern boreal forests. There is a lower population of mammalian wildlife amidst the fens, marshes, bogs and swamps that demark the <b>muskeg</b> area of the Mid-Boreal Lowland. The large mammals of the northern Taiga Shield and Boreal ecozones can still be supported in this transitional area, however elk, reindeer, wolf are animals of the boreal forest.|$|E
25|$|The segment between Peterborough and Perth {{was built}} in the 1930s during the Great Depression, as a public works {{employment}} project. It was constructed parallel to a CP Rail corridor (now abandoned east of Peterborough) that {{was built in}} the 1880s, and used hand-power to dig and build the road whenever possible. From Peterborough to Norwood, the route travels in a straight line through the Peterborough Drumlin Field, connecting to the southern terminus of Highway28 and crossing the Indian River while otherwise passing through farmland. At Norwood the route suddenly begins to meander as it approaches the undulated Canadian Shield. The section east of Havelock to Perth, unlike the rest of the highway, travels through a relatively isolated area, with few services or residences along the route outside of the several towns that it connects. In contrast to the surroundings west of there, this section is located in dense forest with numerous lakes and <b>muskeg</b> dotting the landscape. It services the villages of Marmora, where it connects with the northern terminus of former Highway14, Madoc, where it intersect Highway62, Actinolite, where it meets the northern terminus of Highway37, and Kaladar, where it intersects Highway41.|$|E
50|$|It {{grows in}} {{several types of}} habitat. It grows in {{coniferous}} forests and alpine habitat types, near rivers and streams, in bogs, <b>muskegs,</b> swamps, and moraines. It is common on floodplains, where it grows with other willow species and various shrubs. It {{can also be found}} on serpentine barrens, salt marshes, and salt flats. It easily colonizes wet places recently cleared of vegetation, such as gravel bars.|$|R
50|$|This {{plant is}} a {{dominant}} {{species on the}} tundra in many areas. It commonly grows with sedges. It may form thickets with other species of willow along waterways and on floodplains. It grows in spruce woodlands and <b>muskegs.</b> It grows above the timberline in interior Alaska, and at the timberline in northern Alaska. It often sprouts and grows after wildfire, and it persists in open habitat.|$|R
50|$|This plant {{grows in}} {{coniferous}} forests in alpine climates. The smaller variety grows in swampy {{areas such as}} black spruce <b>muskegs.</b> Tall blueberry willow often occupies riparian habitat, forming thickets along waterways. It is common along the Tanana and Yukon Rivers. It grows alongside many other willow species. It is a pioneer species, colonizing areas covered in recently deposited alluvium, such as floodplains recently scoured by flood waters.|$|R
