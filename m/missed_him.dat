5|$|Back at the front, Potemkin {{won more}} {{military}} acclaim, but then fell ill; rejecting medicine, he recovered only slowly. After {{a lull in}} hostilities in 1772 his movements are unclear, {{but it seems that}} he returned to St. Petersburg where he is recorded, perhaps apocryphally, to have been one of Catherine's closest advisers. Though Orlov was replaced as her favourite, it was not Potemkin who benefited. Alexander Vasilchikov, another Horse-Guardsman, replaced Orlov as the queen's lover. Potemkin returned to war in 1773 as Lieutenant-General to fight in Silistria. It appears that Catherine <b>missed</b> <b>him,</b> and that Potemkin took a December letter from her as a summons. In any case Potemkin returned to St. Petersburg as a war hero.|$|E
5|$|He {{scored two}} more {{victories}} on 23 and 28 April, his {{first in the}} North African Campaign. However, on 23 April, Marseille himself was shot down during his third sortie of that day by Sous-Lieutenant James Denis a Free French pilot with No. 73 Squadron RAF (8.5 victories), flying a Hawker Hurricane. Marseille's Bf 109 received almost 30 hits in the cockpit area, and three or four shattered the canopy. As Marseille was leaning forward the rounds <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> by inches. Marseille managed to crash-land his fighter. Just a month later, records show that James Denis shot down Marseille again on 21 May 1941. Marseille engaged Denis, but overshot his target. A turning dogfight ensued, in which Denis once again bested Marseille.|$|E

After the Klansmen left, Moton began searching for help, and eventually flagged down a truck driven by Rev. Leon Riley. Rev Riley was, like Moton and Liuzzo, shuttling civil rights workers back to Selma.|$|E

25|$|Natalie's parents {{separated}} {{early in}} her childhood and she took it badly. She lived with her mother Andrea (Cindy O'Callaghan) in Walford, {{but she had been}} closer to her father, Dave, and <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> terribly. Andrea favoured her other children, especially her older daughter Susie (Viva Duce), over Natalie. She was highly critical of Natalie and blamed her for the breakdown of her marriage (the unwanted pregnancy had ruined her figure and singing career, causing her husband to leave her). Andrea and Susie ridiculed Natalie for missing her father and wanting to keep in touch; Andrea claimed that Dave had no interest in Natalie.|$|E

25|$|With his underlings {{attending}} to the seizure of Vientiane, Thao Ma commandeered an AT-28 fighter-bomber. Accounts disagree {{on the number of}} sorties flown by Thao Ma and his wingmen. While contemporary news accounts state Thao Ma flew at least three times, historians note only that he was accompanied by six loyal pilots. It is agreed that his principal target was a fellow general whom he hated, Kouprasith Abhay. Both Kouprasith's home and office were bombed by the AT-28s, but <b>missed</b> <b>him.</b> As Royalist troops began to rally against the coup, American colonel Al Degroote drove to the home of the commanding general of the Air Force. General Sourith Don Sasorith refused to come out of hiding, and lurked in his house with a blue and white scarf handy.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the first}} years of the 1980s the Muslim Brotherhood and various other Islamist factions staged {{hit-and-run}} and bomb attacks against the government and its officials, including a nearly successful attempt to assassinate President Hafez al-Assad on 26 June 1980, during an official state reception for the president of Mali. When a machine-gun salvo <b>missed</b> <b>him,</b> al-Assad allegedly ran to kick a hand grenade aside, and his bodyguard (who survived and was later promoted to a much higher position) smothered the explosion of another one. Surviving with only light injuries, al-Assad's revenge was swift and merciless: only hours later a large number of imprisoned Islamists (reports say more than 1200) were executed in their cells in Tadmor Prison (near Palmyra), by units loyal to the President's brother Rifaat al-Assad.|$|E
25|$|During Macedonski's absence, {{his style}} and work {{had come to}} be {{reviewed}} more positively, in particular by the young authors I. Dragoslav, Horia Furtună, Ion Pillat, Anastasie Mândru, Al. T. Stamatiad, as well as by post-Junimist critic Mihail Dragomirescu, who offered Macedonski a good reception in his Convorbiri Critice magazine. Tudor Vianu, who cites contemporary statements by Dragoslav, concludes that, upon arrival, Macedonski was enthusiastically received by a public who had <b>missed</b> <b>him.</b> Also in 1912, one of his poems was published as an homage by Simbolul, a magazine published by the young and radical Symbolists Tristan Tzara, Ion Vinea and Marcel Janco. Around that time, Macedonski also collaborated with the Iași-based moderate Symbolist magazine Versuri și Proză. Polemics surrounding his case nevertheless continued: in late 1912, as part of a National Theater adaptation of Alphonse Daudet's Sapho, actor Cazimir Belcot borrowed from Macedonski's appearance and mannerisms to portray a failure.|$|E

In January 1924, his brother left England to work in India as a rubber planter. Olivier <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> greatly and asked his father how soon he could follow. He recalled in his memoirs that his father replied, [...] "Don't be such a fool, you're not going to India, you're going on the stage." ...|$|E

The Bingles then brought Jay Tummelson on as a third owner of 54°40' Orphyte. 54°40' Orphyte put out two Timemaster adventures, <b>Miss</b> <b>Him,</b> <b>Miss</b> <b>Him,</b> <b>Miss</b> <b>Him</b> (1991) and Darkest Before the Dawn (1992) and supported the line with RPGA tournaments for a while. 54°40' Orphyte sold the rights to Pacesetter's game Star Ace to Philip J.

500|$|Although Kelly {{was raised}} as a Roman Catholic, he later {{described}} himself as a non-believer in any religion. He is the great great grandson of Jeremiah Kelly, who emigrated from Ireland in 1852 and settled in Clare, South Australia. His paternal grandfather, Francis Kelly, established a law firm in 1917, which his father, John, joined in 1937. John Kelly died in 1968 at the age of 52, after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three years earlier. Paul Kelly was thirteen years old when his father died. Kelly described his father: [...] "I have good memories, {{he was the kind of}} father that, well, I <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> when he died very much. The older children were growing into him at the time he died. He was not well enough to play sport with me".|$|E
500|$|Bidar Bakht {{found it}} {{difficult}} to mobilise all of his men to fight since they were [...] "scattered to plunder camp". The attacking force started raining arrows on them and discharging rockets at them. Khan Alam Dakhini charged Bahadur Shah's army with three hundred soldiers. He threw a spear towards Azim-ush-Shan seated in the howdah of the elephant. It <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> and instead hit his attendant, Jalal Khan. Dakhini was killed by an arrow as he attempted to jump on the prince's howdah. Jalal Khan boarded a separate elephant, and after he inflicted an injury on Munavvar Khan, Munavvar Khan's soldiers fled. This exposed the wing of Prince Wala-Jah. Seeing this, Amanullah Khan, {{who was in charge of}} a separate wing, hastened to render assistance. But his elephant was set on fire, and his troops fled, thinking that their leader was dead. This made Wala-Jah retreat from the battle.|$|E

Animal trainer Dunn, speaking to the News of the World, stated that the chimpanzee would miss Jackson. [...] "Bubbles definitely <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> when they parted and will miss him now.
