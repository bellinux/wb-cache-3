5|$|For {{surface water}} {{sources such as}} lakes and reservoirs, the volume {{available}} for dilution of ionic species leached from ash is generally large. The most abundant components of ash leachates (Ca, Na, Mg, K, Cl, F and SO4) occur naturally at significant concentrations in most surface waters and therefore are not affected greatly by inputs from volcanic ashfall, and are also of low concern in drinking water, {{with the possible exception}} of fluorine. The elements iron, manganese and aluminium are commonly enriched over background levels by volcanic ashfall. These elements may impart a metallic taste to water, and may produce red, brown or black staining of whiteware, but are not considered a health risk. Volcanic ashfalls are not known to have caused problems in water supplies for toxic trace elements such as <b>mercury</b> (<b>Hg)</b> and lead (Pb) which occur at very low levels in ash leachates.|$|E

Considerable research effort has been expended on the HgTe-ZnTe solid solutions. However, the experimental thermodynamic and phase diagram data for this ternary system are limited. The experimental technique consisted of measuring the optical density of the vapor phase coexisting {{with a sample of}} the solid solution in a sealed optical cell of known volume and temperature. In high temperature measurements between 500 and 800 ∘C with a high pressure Xenon lamp, the partial pressures of <b>mercury</b> P <b>Hg</b> and of diatomic tellurium P 2 have been determined for x = 0. 10, 0. 20, 0. 30, 0. 50, and 0. 70. The optical density was measured between 250 and 750 nm. It was possible to place narrow limits on the solidus temperature for some of the x values and to derive the chemical potential of HgTe in the solid solutions. In low temperature measurements between 100 and 230 ∘C with a Hg hollow-cathode lamp, the partial pressures of <b>mercury</b> P <b>Hg</b> has been determined for the Te- saturated solid solutions for x = 0. 0, 0. 10, 0. 20, 0. 30, 0. 50, and 0. 70.

In recent times, FRET (Forster resonance energy transfer) assembly has been developed by Yu et al. using gold nanoclusters capped by glutathione (AuNCs@GSH). The assembly {{was found to be}} highly selective for amino acid cysteine which may be employed in future for diagnosing of cysteine-related diseases [74]. The cysteine-rich protein-templated AuNCs were prepared using silver(I) ion. Keratin is a cysteine-rich structural proteins found abundant in hair, wool, feathers, etc. Therefore, silver ions based keratin-templated AuNCs were synthesized and evaluated for their sensing application of <b>mercury</b> ion (<b>Hg</b> 2 +) [75]. Based on dual-emission carbon dots-gold nanoclusters (C-AuNCs) functionalized with dithiothreitol (DTT), a ratiometric fluorescence sensor for the sensitive detection of <b>mercury</b> ions (<b>Hg</b> 2 +) in water samples has recently been reported [76]. The above two reported applications of AuNCs may act as of great significance for monitoring the quality of water. Cyclodextrin-capped AuNCs have been reported for detection of cobalt ions (Co 2 +) and display fluorescence-based selective and sensitive Co 2 + ion sensing. Cellular internalization of AuNCs was also observed during the sensing of Co 2 + ions [77].|$|R
