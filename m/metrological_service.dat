40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide an economic perspective to those involved in public financing of the national metrology infrastructure. Whereas justifications for subsidising the national metrological activities are often historically based, we raise the importance of economic considerations, which could be used during prioritisation. The expenditure in measurement and metrology infrastructure of European countries are compared to economic indicators for quality of life. Various proxies are used, such as measuring instruments sale (for measurement infrastructure) and data from the BIPM's KCDB (as a proxy for national standards). As the EU Internal Market also holds for the provision of <b>metrological</b> <b>services,</b> the paper exposes possible trends regarding public financing to the sector. JRC.

40|$|There {{the study}} objects are {{the methods and}} the aids to measure the rates of {{production}} flows of liquid and gaseous media. The purposes are to generalize, to evolve, to create and to improve the theory of measurement aids, measurement methods and instruments for {{it as well as}} the methods of processing and representation of results of metrological study. The theory of flowmeters of constant differential pressure (the rotameters) has been developed; the scientifically-grounded methods of application of flowmeters in the media which are different from the agreed-upon gradyatuib ones (the water, the air) have been obtained. The conversion procedure of metrological characteristics of flowmeters of constant differential pressure to other media as well as the particular methods of conversion of heat laminar-flow flowmeters have been created. The conversion methods and more 70 conversion tables are enclosed with the certificate of instruments in production. 22 standards have been developed; among them are 3 State Standards, 1 Branch Standard, 13 Methodical Instructions, 5 techniques of metrological certification. The application fields are the organizations which measure the flow rates of liquid and gaseous media, the <b>metrological</b> <b>services</b> and centres.

30|$|In the Banana Plain, {{the climate}} is {{equatorial}} type influenced by monsoon winds (July to September) {{during the rainy season}} with maximum rainfall in September with about 175 – 200 rainfall days per year. There are two distinct seasons, a dry season from November to June and rainy season from July to October. Ten-year (1985 – 1994) metrological data indicate that in Mbanga, the annual average rainfall is 1, 626  mm, 3, 197  mm in Njombe and 2, 769  mm in Penja. Temperatures vary between 19 and 32  °C with an average of 25  °C (National <b>Metrological</b> <b>Service</b> 2008). The climate is humid tropical in the Mount Cameroon area characterized by extreme rainfalls and elevated temperatures all year long. The combination of high relief (4, 095  m) and proximity of the sea leads to strong local climatic contrast. Mean annual temperature decreases from 26 – 29  °C at sea level to 0  °C {{at the top of the}} edifice and this large temperature drop is associated with a decrease in rainfall. The highest rainfall is recorded on the southwest flank of Mount Cameroon where rainfall can reach 12  m/year. Lower rainfalls occur on the opposite flank because it is partially sheltered from the oceanic influence (for example, rainfall at Ekona is 1, 800  mm/year) (Fraser et al. 1998).|$|E
30|$|The {{practical}} {{utilization of}} available modern {{as well as}} traditional weather forecasting systems builds herders’ resiliency capacity to climatic shocks. The precision and reliability of the forecasting system determines its creditability and acceptance by the users to be proactive in the decisions they make based on the forecasted information. It has been postulated that traditional weather forecasting systems are becoming less reliable due to repeated faulty forecasts. The study assesses {{the current status of}} the Borana traditional weather forecasting system and how traditional experts make weather forecasts based on biotic indicators such as intestinal readings, changes in plant and animal body languages. Questionnaire survey, field observations, focus group discussions and interviews with relevant key informants were employed to obtain data. Collected field data was compared with National <b>Metrological</b> <b>Service</b> Agency instrumental data for consistency. Results reveal that herders made short term weather forecasts using intestinal readings, and observed changes in plant and animal body languages. The study shows the extent how public confidence in the accuracy of indigenous weather forecasting skills has been gradually eroded overtime due to faulty forecasts. The precision and credibility of the traditional weather forecast steadily declined and led to repeated faulty predictions. Poor documentation, oral based knowledge transfer system, influence of religion and modern education, aging and extinction of traditional experts were identified as the major causes undermining the vitality of traditional climate forecast. Traditional weather foresting knowledge and skill could have some utility and also serve as a starting point to scientifically study the relationship between various signs and implied climatic events. This article recommends before traditional Borana weather forecasting system completely disappears, a remedial action should be carried out to rescue this long established wisdom, knowledge and skill and maximize the benefits from what works well. The forecast needs of herders could be rendered by a combination of modern and traditional weather forecasting services. Further research is required to explore possible area of complementarity between the modern and traditional forecasting systems for improved efficiency and effectiveness in predictability, dissemination and advice.|$|E
40|$|Latvian National Metrology Centre is {{a public}} {{organization}} with legal liability. Its main task is to ensure uniformity of measurement {{throughout the country and}} provide <b>metrological</b> <b>services</b> to persons and organizations. The Latvian law currently in force is “Law of traceability”. The objective of the law is to defend people’s life, health and environment. In Latvia, there is highest metrological institute: The Latvian National Metrology Centre, State agency. Main tasks of State Agency are to maintain uniformity and traceability of physical units, verification and calibration of measuring instruments and standards (weights etc.). Department of mass measurement of State Agency is a holder of national mass standards. These are 1 kg mass standard in stainless steel and two sets of mass standards (from 1 mg to 500 g). Laboratory performs periodic calibration and statistical analysis of mass standards. The Department of mass measurement ensures traceability between national mass standards (with values derived from the International Prototype of the kilogram) and weights of class E 1 and lower. Once in two years national mass standards are carried to DFM (Dansk Fundamental Metrologi, Denmark) or other laboratory for calibration. Department of mass measurement of State Agency has probably the best mass measurement equipment in Latvia, such as “Sartorius” comparator (high-precision mass measurement instrument). ScalesNet 32 is the software used for data acquisition and analysis. Computer running ScalesNet 32 is connected to both comparator and climate control system of the lab. This equipment allows LNMC to perform calibration of E 1 class weights (most accurate ones). Department of mass measurement of State Agency does participate in various international interlaboratory comparisons schemes: “ 839 EUROMET”, “EUROMET 786 ”, “LNMC (Latvia) -METROSERT (Estonia) - MIKES (Finland) ”, “ 832 EUROMET” and others. At present, the laboratory is planning interlaboratory comparison of mass measurement capability between various Latvian laboratories. Department of mass measurement will be the pilot laboratory of the comparison. Comparisons like this have never been carried out before. This comparison will be first such project in Latvia. We have to adapt existing methods and procedures for our needs or develop new ones. Major complication is that there is strong competition between some of participants. However, small size of Latvia makes transfer of standards less complex and expensive task. Interlaboratory comparisons allow laboratories to validate measurement capability, identify and correct measurement errors, assess technical proficiency and calibration procedures, verify adequacy of laboratory environment, provide evidence of measurement traceability and demonstrate measurement comparability between laboratories...|$|R
