40|$|Abstract Traditionally, {{classical}} {{methods of}} structural analysis such as slope-deflection and <b>moment</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>methods</b> (Cross method) {{are used for}} primary analysis of structures and also controlling the results of computer programs. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to introduce a new method for classical computing and extending it to a matrix formulation. The proposed approach, named the "Slope <b>Distribution</b> <b>Method</b> (SDM) ", is based on a Jacobi iterative procedure, in which without forming the system of linear equations, structural displacement values are obtained. Also, to make the method applicable and to use it in computer softwares, the matrix formulation of the approach is developed, where there is no need for iterative procedures and the nodal rotations are obtained through solving only one matrix equation. The SDM is able to analyze frames with non-vertical columns and those with nodal vertical displacement. Whereas current analysis softwares have some elimination for the analysis of non-prismatic members, the proposed method can be applied to analyze structures with any non-prismatic member. The SDM process is also developed for the analysis of dual lateral load resisting systems (moment resisting frames with other lateral load resisting elements such as bracings and shear walls). The advantages of the method over previous ones and also, its accuracy and reliability are presented through the article...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} {{in the analysis of}} beams with Moment of Inertia varying along their length, is to find the Fixed End Moments, Stiffness, and Carry-Over Factors. In order to determine Fixed End Moments, it is necessary to consider the non-prismatic member as integrated by a large number of small sections with constant Moment of Inertia, and to find the M/EI values for each individual section. This process {{takes a lot of time}} from Designers and Structural Engineers. The object of this thesis is to design a computer program to simplify this repetitive process, obtaining rapidly and effectively the Final Moments and Shears in continuous non-prismatic Beams. For this purpose the Column Analogy and the <b>Moment</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>Methods</b> of Professor Hardy Cross have been utilized as the principles toward the methodical computer solutions. The program has been specifically designed to analyze continuous beams of a maximum of four spans of any length, integrated by symmetrical members with rectangular cross sections and with rectilinear variation of the Moment of Inertia. Any load or combination of uniform and concentrated loads must be considered. Finally sample problems will be solved with the new Computer Program and with traditional systems, to determine the accuracy and applicability of the Program...|$|R
40|$|This {{method is}} a kind of <b>moment</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>methods.</b> In an {{analysis}} of a non-rectangular rigid frame by the ordinary <b>method</b> of <b>moment</b> <b>distribution,</b> there must be needed to provide temporary support reactions and enforcing displacement forces. But in this method, none of these forces are needed. This method involves two main processes which are called “distribution　process” and “allotment　process” respectively, the former is utilized in ordinary method of moment distriblltion which satisfies the moment equations at joints, While the latter is a new concept which satisfies shear equations of the slope-deflection method. The “allotment process” is the process enforcing a kind of deformation of frames in which only one independent member rotation angle occures, while the others are kept zero and every joint rotation is fixed. End moments in this process necessarily satisfy corresponding shear equation of the slope deflection method. These end moments can be calculated from the storey moments muliplied by “allotments coefficients. ” The storey moments is the minus-signed work done by the loads applied on the frames in the shear eruation, which is virtual work equation of load-and-end-moment system of the frame when only one independent member rotation angle can occure and its value is unit quantity but the others are zero. The “allotment　coefficient” is the ratio of the allotment moment(end moment) to the storey moment when only one independent member rotation occure and the others and all joint rotation are kept zero. A member of the rigid frame can have several alltoment coefficients each of of which oorresponds each independent member rotation angle. This method consists in altertive application of distribution process and allotment process. Then moment equations and shear equations in the slope deflection method are iteraly and one by one satisfied approximately. So after several applications, we can get exact solution...|$|R
25|$|The <b>moment</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>method</b> is a {{structural}} analysis method for statically indeterminate beams and frames developed by Hardy Cross. It {{was published in}} 1930 in an ASCE journal. The method only accounts for flexural effects and ignores axial and shear effects. From the 1930s until computers began to be widely used {{in the design and}} analysis of structures, the <b>moment</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>method</b> was the most widely practiced method.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>moment</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>method,</b> every {{joint of}} the {{structure}} to be analysed is fixed so as to develop the fixed-end moments. Then each fixed joint is sequentially released and the fixed-end moments (which {{by the time of}} release are not in equilibrium) are distributed to adjacent members until equilibrium is achieved. The <b>moment</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>method</b> in mathematical terms can be demonstrated as the process of solving a set of simultaneous equations by means of iteration.|$|E

40|$|To {{explain the}} cause of axial {{rotation}} in a scoliotic vertebral column, {{the influence of the}} gravitation force on a spine with a C-scoliosis has been investigated by means of a mechanical model.

40|$|The {{flexural}} {{capacity of}} the new hollow flange steel section known as LiteSteel beam (LSB) is limited by lateral distortional buckling, which is characterised by simultaneous lateral deflection, twist and web distortion. Recent research into this unique buckling behaviour has developed appropriate design rules for the member capacity of LiteSteel beams.

Many steel design codes have adopted equivalent uniform <b>moment</b> <b>distribution</b> and load height factors to ac-commodate different loading conditions. However, past investigations have shown the inadequacy of these factors to different cross sections and materials. This paper describes the effects of non-uniform moment dis-tribution and load height on the lateral buckling strength of LSBs based on finite element analyses of LiteS-teel beams. It presents the finite element analysis results and a discussion of suitable design methods for LSBs subject to non-uniform distributions and varying loading position...|$|R
