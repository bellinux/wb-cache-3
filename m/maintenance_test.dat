50|$|A {{noteworthy}} {{variation of}} this is found on the Burroughs B1700 where there is neither a bootstrap ROM nor a hardwired IPL operation. Instead, after the system is reset it reads and executes opcodes sequentially from a tape drive mounted on the front panel; this sets up a boot loader in RAM which is then executed. However, since this makes few assumptions about the system it can equally well be used to load diagnostic (<b>Maintenance</b> <b>Test</b> Routine) tapes which display an intelligible code on the front panel even in cases of gross CPU failure.|$|E

5000|$|A {{dielectric}} withstand test or [...] "high potential" [...] or [...] "hipot" [...] test is an electrical test performed on a component or product {{to determine the}} effectiveness of its insulation. The test may be between mutually insulated sections of a part or energized parts and electrical ground. The test is a means to qualify a device's ability to operate safely during rated electrical conditions. If current through a device under test {{is less than a}} specified limit at the required test potential and time duration, the device meets the {{dielectric withstand}} requirement. A dielectric withstand test may be done as a factory test on new equipment, or may be done on apparatus in service as a routine <b>maintenance</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

Initially, it operated a Heinkel He 111H (AW177) shot down in Scotland in February 1940, a Messerschmitt Bf 109 captured during the Battle of France (AE479) (turned over from the Air Fighting Development Unit), and a Junkers Ju 88A-5 (HM509). The Ju 88 was a more recent British acquisition after the pilot landed at night at RAF Chivenor in the belief it was an airfield in France--the crew had made a navigational error after being deceived by a Meacon. A General Aircraft Monospar was also assigned to the unit for general communication tasks and collecting spare parts.|$|E
