40|$|Many {{agreements}} and contracts contain deadlines. Because deadlines combine time and obligations, they are naturally studied {{by a combination}} of temporal logic with deontic logic [2]. A deadline, that ϕ should occur before δ, can be expressed as a formula which involves the ‘until’-operator: OBL(ϕ Uδ). However, such a characterisation does not in-dicate what will happen after the deadline. Since deadlines can have different functions, it is likely that several notions of deadline can be distinguished. Recently, we have pre-sented a conceptual analysis of deadlines, based on the following parameters: whether we are dealing with an achievement or a <b>maintenance</b> <b>obligation,</b> persistence of the oblig-ation after the deadline, the choice of modal operator (permission or obligation) and the presence of an explicit or implicit sanction [3]. Temporal Modal Defeasible Logic For each of these parameters template formulas are provided, in a logic called Temporal Modal Defeasible logic (TMDL). TMDL is an ex-tension of Defeasible Logic [1] to capture deontic modalities (OBL,PERM) and aspects of time, in particular intervals. For example, OBLpay: [t,max] expresses that there is obligation to pay from t until indefinitely. Crucial is the distinction between strict rule...|$|R

50|$|The Reformation had {{the effect}} that the {{territory}} of the Margrave of Baden-Durlach only Lutheran pastors were permitted. The Jus patronatus was, however, in many case owned by Catholic monasteries or religious orders, which would now have to pay for a Lutheran pastor. This, of course, caused resistance. The Peace of Augsburg had clear rules for this kind of situation. Religious institutions were allowed to keep their possessions in Protestant areas, but they indeed had to for the evangelical pastor. Based on the territorial claims of the House of Habsburg on the Upper Baden lordships mentioned above, the prelates held that the <b>maintenance</b> <b>obligation</b> did not apply to them, and the intended to keep the tithes. Charles then seized their estates and used them to fund the maintenance of churches and pastors. Johann Ulrich Zasius mediated and reached a compromise: the confiscated estates were returned to their owners, but Baden-Durlach was allowed to retain the funds necessary to pay the pastors. However, the Austrian authorities in Innsbruck did not accept this compromise and the confrontation escalated. After some prelates made separate agreements with Baden-Durlach, the negotiations were resumed and led to the treaty of Neuenburg am Rhein of 24 April 1561, with essentially the same result as the earlier agreement.|$|R
