50|$|The standings {{were changed}} further on January 13, 2006, when Frank Branch left the Liberal caucus to sit as an {{independent}}; and on February 17, 2006, when then Progressive Conservative MLA Michael Malley crossed {{the floor to}} sit as an independent thus putting Bernard Lord's government into a minority situation. Malley, while serving as speaker, changed his affiliation back to Progressive Conservative on April 13, 2006. Some controversy arose following this as following the 2003 election, the House unanimously passed a motion requiring the Opposition Liberals to pair a member with the speaker during <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>committees</b> of the whole {{in order to maintain}} the government majority in such situations. The Opposition argued that there was no precedent for a speaker to cross the floor and therefore, they did not recognize that a majority government existed and would not honour this motion under the circumstances. The House voted on May 30, 2006 to express confidence in the Speaker and therefore, implicitly, approve of his change of affiliation. From that date forward, the Liberals accepted Malley as a Progressive Conservative.|$|E
