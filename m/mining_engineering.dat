5|$|Frederick Benjamin Carlin {{was born}} on 27 July 1912 in Northam, Western Australia, {{a small town in}} the state's Wheatbelt. His mother, the former Charlotte Amelia Bramwell, died when he was four, and he was raised by his father, Frederick Cecil Carlin, who was an {{electrical}} engineer employed with the Western Australian Government Railways. At the age of ten, Carlin was sent to board at Guildford Grammar School in Perth. Leaving school in 1929, he enrolled at the School of Mines in Kalgoorlie, where he studied <b>mining</b> <b>engineering.</b> Once he had qualified as an engineer, he worked {{for a period of time}} in the surrounding Goldfields region. However, in 1939, he moved to Peking, China, to work for a British coal mining company.|$|E

5|$|Most {{official}} {{records show}} Davies's birth date as November 1886, {{but he is}} widely {{thought to have been}} born at least four years earlier. After leaving school aged 12 and working for some years in local pits, Davies studied <b>mining</b> <b>engineering</b> and later took an Arts degree at University College, Cardiff. He returned to the coalfields in 1913, and established a reputation for militancy. In 1918 he was elected miners' agent for the Dowlais district of the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF), and in 1924 was appointed SWMF's chief organiser, legal adviser, and vice-president. After a visit to Moscow in 1922 he became a firm advocate of the Soviet Union, a position he maintained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{attended}} the local Cap Coch school, leaving {{at the age}} of 12, as was usual at that time, to begin work in the Cwmpennar coal mine. He remained there until the mine was exhausted in 1905, when he moved to Mountain Ash to work at Nixon's Navigation Colliery. His ambition and intelligence were quickly recognised by his superiors, and he was encouraged to study <b>mining</b> <b>engineering,</b> at first locally in Aberdare and, in 1907, at the Royal College of Science in London. In 1908, with sponsorship from the Brecon Memorial College, he passed his matriculation and began studying for a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree at University College, Cardiff, with a view thereafter to entering the nonconformist ministry. However, Davies's religious beliefs were influenced by R. J. Campbell, a noted preacher who rejected much traditional Christian teaching and asserted that socialism was the practical expression of Christianity. Davies's association with such supposed heresies was unacceptable to the Brecon college, which withdrew its financial support.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March 1933 he {{was invited}} for an {{interview}} for a commission in the Air Force in Pretoria. One of 30 applicants vying for three places, he was rejected for lack of flying experience. Determined to rectify this weakness, he went to Johannesburg and began taking flying lessons. To fund his new ambition, {{he worked for a}} mining company, Sheba Gold Mine. He enjoyed the work so much he considered studying for a degree in <b>mining</b> <b>engineering.</b> His passion for flying subsided, but an impromptu visit by a transport aircraft gave Pattle a close glimpse of it, which rekindled his interest. At around the same time, the Ministry of Defence created the Special Service Battalion to employ South African youth who were struggling to find work because of the Great Depression. He joined up in 1936 hoping it would lead to a career in the Air Force. He undertook basic training and national service on the understanding that he would be given an opportunity to enter the Air Force as an instructor {{at the end of his}} four-year service.|$|E
