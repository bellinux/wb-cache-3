The film was successful at the box office, grossing $110 million worldwide. Roger Ebert in The Chicago Sun Times wrote; [...] "Fox provides a fairly desperate center for the film.

As well as becoming the first album ever by a Swiss group to top the Swiss album chart, it was the band's breakthrough album internationally, helped by the success of the song [...] "Oh Yeah", which gained the band worldwide attention the following year after it was prominently featured in the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off and then a year later in The Secret of <b>My</b> <b>Success.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A {{business}} will most often {{have more than}} one asset account. An essential asset account in any business is the business's bank account (see: [...] "Accounts pertaining to the five accounting elements" [...] below for more examples) The same applies to liability accounts i.e. if I have borrowed money from two sources (called creditors or payables), then I must open two accounts to represent this present liability, called 'Creditor/Payable A' and 'Creditor/Payable B'. In this manner I may have multiple, different accounts. However all these accounts are all classified as one of the five types of accounts, therefore my entire business can be described in terms of its assets, expenses, liabilities, income and equity/capital (see extended accounting equation). This is the extent of [...] "my" [...] business in relation to accounts, regardless of the business' practices (the business may be a retail franchise, furniture shop, restaurant, etc.). With respect to my business, each of the five accounting elements will have a monetary value, and this can be used to assess the financial position of my business at any time (<b>my</b> <b>success,</b> failure, or any other attributes that I might need to know).|$|E
2500|$|Throughout her career, Vélez's onscreen {{persona of}} a hot tempered, lusty [...] "wild" [...] woman was closely tied to her off screen personality. The press often {{referred}} to her by such names as [...] "The Mexican Spitfire", [...] "The Mexican It girl" [...] and [...] "The Mexican Kitten". Vélez consciously chose to promote her [...] "Whoopee Lupe" [...] persona but dismissed {{the idea that she}} was wild. In an interview she said: [...] "What I attribute <b>my</b> <b>success?,</b> I think, simply, because I'm different. I'm not beautiful, but I have beautiful eyes and know exactly what to do with them. Although the public thinks that I'm a very wild girl. Actually I'm not. I'm just me, Lupe Vélez, simple and natural Lupe. If I'm happy, I dance and sing and acted like a child. And if something irritates me, I cry and sob. Someone called that 'personality.' The Personality is nothing more than behave with others as you really are. If I tried to look and act like Norma Talmadge, the great dramatic actress, or like Corinne Griffith, the aristocrat of the movies, or like Mary Pickford, the sweet and gentle Mary, I would be nothing more than an imitation. I just want to be myself: Lupe Velez." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973 she was {{a student}} at the University of the Witwatersrand when she met her first husband, the finance magnate and art collector, Gordon Schachat. They married in Mauritius in 1982 and shared a home {{together}} in Linksfield Ridge, an upscale Jewish area in Johannesburg's northern suburbs. Their two-year marriage ended in divorce in 1984. Allan attributed her burgeoning career as a factor: [...] "I was obsessed with my column. I was intent on becoming the best journalist in the country." [...] They remained friends and Schachat supported Allan's testimony in the 1992 libel suit she brought against Channel 4 in London. Allan told a London court that eight years after their marriage breakup, Schachat was her closest friend and described their union as [...] "the right people at the wrong time." [...] Allan writes about the marriage to Schachat in her 2015 memoir, Jani Confidential: [...] "I keep thinking about what happened and what I would have done differently. Pretty much everything I suppose. Gordon had to live through the weekly angst about the column. It was like reinventing the wheel every week. My validity as a partner hinged - or so I thought - on <b>my</b> <b>success</b> as a columnist. I couldn't have got it more wrong.
