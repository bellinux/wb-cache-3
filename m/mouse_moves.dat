2500|$|Mickeys {{per second}} is {{a unit of}} {{measurement}} for the speed and movement direction of a computer mouse, where direction is often expressed as [...] "horizontal" [...] versus [...] "vertical" [...] mickey count. However, speed can also refer to the ratio between how many pixels the cursor moves {{on the screen and}} how far the <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> on the mouse pad, which may be expressed as pixels per mickey, pixels per inch, or pixels per centimeter.|$|E
60|$|Ben gave an inward sigh at the {{prospect}} before him; for an hour's captivity to an active lad is hard to bear, and he really did want to behave well. So he folded his arms and sat like a statue, with nothing moving but his eyes. They rolled to and fro, up and down, from the high red pulpit to the worn hymnbooks in the rack, recognizing two little faces under blue-ribboned hats in a distant pew, and finding it impossible to restrain a momentary twinkle {{in return for the}} solemn wink Billy Barton bestowed upon him across the aisle. Ten minutes of this decorous demeanor made it absolutely necessary for him to stir; so he unfolded his arms and crossed his legs as cautiously as a <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> {{in the presence of a}} cat; for Mrs. Allen's eye was on him, and he knew by experience that it was a very sharp one.|$|E
5000|$|User events, such as {{keyboard}} keys pressed and <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> and clicks with exact time.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} VMAT {{inhibition}} {{have been studied}} in-depth in animal models. Mutant homozygous VMAT(-/-) <b>mice</b> <b>move</b> little, feed poorly, and die {{within a few days}} of birth.|$|R
50|$|For all regular polygons, {{the mice}} trace out a {{logarithmic}} spiral, which meets {{in the center}} of the polygon (as shown on the right). When additional mice are added and the <b>mice</b> <b>move</b> towards non-immediate neighbours, the paths they trace become more complex.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is entirely}} {{controlled}} with the <b>mouse.</b> <b>Moving</b> it controls the camera, while the left button runs forward {{and the right}} walks backwards. Moving into certain objects or areas can cause the character to do additional actions like jumping or activating switches.|$|R
5000|$|An {{observer}} can typically {{watch the}} screen more easily (and less suspiciously) than the keyboard, and see which characters the <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> to.|$|E
50|$|SeeVolution is a {{real-time}} website analytic {{web service}} {{that shows a}} heatmap of a website, detailing where visitors are clicking, <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> and scrolls. The data is used to allow webmasters to see what areas of a website visitors are using.|$|E
5000|$|Windows 10 has a feature, {{turned on}} by default, where moving the mouse over the [...] "show desktop button" [...] in the taskbar turns on [...] "Desktop Peek" [...] which shows the desktop every time the <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> over that button.|$|E
50|$|A {{pointing}} device can generate {{a number of}} software recognisable {{pointing device}} gestures. A mouse can generate a number of mouse events, such as <b>mouse</b> <b>move</b> (including direction of <b>move</b> and distance), <b>mouse</b> left/right button up/down and mouse wheel motion, {{or a combination of}} these gestures.|$|R
40|$|Activity meter {{has been}} {{developed}} using Hall effect devices that record passage of selected groups of magnetically tagged mice. Two small permanent magnets are implanted in belly and back of selected mice and electronic circuits are activated as <b>mice</b> <b>move</b> between cages. System has advantage over tagging, detecting, and identification methods currently used...|$|R
5000|$|The motion {{detection}} signals {{connected to}} the 8530 chip using two non-essential pins used for obsolete modems. Originally these signaled modem connection or disconnection. When the <b>mouse</b> <b>moved</b> by a certain amount, the 8530 would interrupt the processor. The operating system would detect [...] "modem activity" [...] and act to move the cursor.|$|R
5000|$|Laser Mouse - A {{computer}} <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> {{around by}} shooting {{a laser beam}} in front and following him. He comes across an object he cannot get through so uses the laser to make a doorway, though ends up being squished or otherwise.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> along {{rows and}} columns (i.e. {{horizontally}} and vertically). The lion moves on diagonals. The elephant moves along rows, columns and diagonals. An animal can move {{any number of}} squares on the board in a single direction per turn, but may not jump over other animals.|$|E
50|$|The ghost is {{controlled}} using the mouse: moving the <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> the ghost. A press {{on the left}} button of the mouse makes the ghost rotate to the left. A press on the right button of the mouse makes the ghost rotate to the right. A press on a keyboard key (Shift) makes the ghost blow.|$|E
25|$|Ochrotomys nuttalli {{are mainly}} nocturnal, crepuscular and arboreal, {{although}} many {{live on the}} ground as well. Their peak activity occurs around 3–4 hours before dawn. Golden <b>mice</b> <b>move</b> quickly and easily and are able to use their prehensile tails to balance while climbing trees, to hang from branches, and to anchor themselves to a tree limb while they sleep.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, {{researchers}} removed kangaroo rats from {{an ecosystem}} in the Chihuahuan Desert, {{and for many}} years, no other small rodents moved in to fill the niche they left. In 1995, twenty years after the experimental removal, Bailey's pocket <b>mouse</b> <b>moved</b> into the area and filled the gap, almost completely replacing the missing kangaroo rats.|$|R

5000|$|Active Time / Engagement Time - Average {{amount of}} time that {{visitors}} spend actually interacting with content on a web page, based on <b>mouse</b> <b>moves,</b> clicks, hovers and scrolls. Unlike Session Duration and Page View Duration / Time on Page, this metric can accurately measure the length of engagement in the final page view, but it is not available in many analytics tools or data collection methods.|$|E
50|$|Tom lures Jerry {{out with}} cheese {{tied to a}} string before trying to drop a iron onto Jerry, but Jerry moves Tom's foot to make him drop it onto it. Tom then chases Jerry up stairs and both slide down the railing, but the <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> onto an {{alternate}} path while the cat crashes into the wall and a cuckoo clock falls on him.|$|E
50|$|Early {{types of}} optical mice {{have the problem}} of not working well on {{transparent}} or reflective surfaces such as glass or highly polished wood. These surfaces, which often include desk and table surfaces, cause jitter and loss of tracking on the display pointer as the <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> over these reflective spots. The use of mousepads with precision surfaces eliminates spot jitter effects of older and/or low-quality optical mice.|$|E
25|$|A {{windowless}} {{object is}} {{an object that}} doesn't have its own window but it instead displayed in its container's window. It {{is used by the}} container to relay messages received by the container's window that are intended for the contained object. For example, if the <b>mouse</b> is <b>moved</b> over a window, Windows places a <b>mouse</b> <b>move</b> message along with the mouse coordinates in the message queue of the window. If this window contains windowless embedded objects, the message may have to be relayed to such an object if the coordinates of the mouse-pointer are over this object. For similar reasons this interface also provides access to the object's DropTarget interface.|$|R
50|$|Kangaroo rats {{have large}} hind feet with long metatarsals and no first digits. With these they bound around not using their fore feet {{at all for}} locomotion. Pocket mice are smaller and can also move with leaps but they {{normally}} run around on four limbs. Members of the genus Heteromys, the spiny pocket <b>mice,</b> <b>move</b> around on all fours and do not leap at all.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Approaches for multistroke mouse {{gestures}} {{support are}} considered in this paper. Presented way of gestures implementation is oriented on {{creation of new}} elements on a scene or diagram in meta-CASE system. We propose to generate examples of mouse gestures for elements and to allow user create elements by fast <b>mouse</b> <b>move.</b> We present numerical comparison of gestures recognition algorithms before and after training by k-means algorithm. The proposed approach is implemented in QReal meta-CASE-system...|$|R
5000|$|Mickeys {{per second}} is {{a unit of}} {{measurement}} for the speed and movement direction of a computer mouse, where direction is often expressed as [...] "horizontal" [...] versus [...] "vertical" [...] mickey count. However, speed can also refer to the ratio between how many pixels the cursor moves {{on the screen and}} how far the <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> on the mouse pad, which may be expressed as pixels per mickey, pixels per inch, or pixels per centimeter.|$|E
5000|$|The Control-Display Gain (or CD gain) {{describes}} the proportion between {{movements in the}} control space to the movements in the display space. For example, a hardware <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> in another speed or distance than the cursor on the screen. Even if these movements take place in two different spaces, the units for measurement {{have to be the}} same in order to be meaningful (e.g. meters instead of pixels). The CD gain refers to the scale factor of these two movements: ...|$|E
50|$|The lined pocket mouse {{lives in}} a burrow and is nocturnal. The {{entrance}} of the burrow is usually {{at the base of}} a plant, in a crevice or in some other concealed location. When it emerges after dark, the pocket <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> slowly around staying under cover as much as possible. If it needs to cross an open space it moves much more rapidly. It feeds on seeds such as those of the prickly pear (Opuntia) which fall to the ground, but it does not eat the pulp of the cactus fruit.|$|E
50|$|Zooming rollovers: {{when the}} <b>mouse</b> is <b>moved</b> over an image/text or button, it {{increases}} its size, {{depending on the}} limit size the user sets.|$|R
50|$|The band's {{official}} website {{has taken to}} using a similar format for its homepage; when the <b>mouse</b> is <b>moved</b> over each letter, the picture changes.|$|R
30|$|For example, learner’s {{learning}} style was modeled in Stathacopoulou et al. (2007) by monitoring the learner’s actions over time, where each response, {{such as a}} keystroke, <b>mouse</b> <b>move</b> or drag was timed and recorded. The learning environment stored in a log file all available information about what a learner was doing, recording each learner action with a time stamp. Furthermore, this work used teachers’ expertise in order to select the appropriate measures of learner’s observable behavior to serve as indicators of the learner’s {{learning style}}.|$|R
5000|$|The onscreen character's {{movement}} is controlled using a mouse, moving the mouse {{in the direction}} the player wishes the adventurer to move. By positioning the character over a city, town, or pyramid, the player double-clicks the mouse button with the cursor placed {{on top of the}} character. This opens the [...] "gates" [...] of the city, and the screen environment changes to that of the locale's interior. Movement via the <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> the character to the taverns, grocery stores, armories, weaponry shops, magic shops, and temples within a city. A game in progress can only be saved while the character is in a town or city.|$|E
50|$|The Chinese jumping mouse has a head-and-body {{length of}} between 70 and 100 mm and a tail of 115 to 144 mm. The dorsal fur has {{a band of}} dark brown running along the spine but is {{otherwise}} a reddish-brown or ochraceous colour, the flanks are pale reddish-brown and the underparts are white. In the nominate subspecies, E. s. setchuanus, there is a narrow brown mid-ventral stripe, but in E. s. vicinus the belly is entirely white. The hind limbs are much longer than the fore limbs, and this <b>mouse</b> <b>moves</b> about by crawling or {{by a series of}} short hops. The long tail is sparsely clad with short hair, has a white tip, and is otherwise greyish-brown above and white below.|$|E
30|$|Learner's motivational {{state was}} {{assessed}} in Stathacopoulou et al. (2004). For that, {{the learning environment}} stored in a log file all the available information about what a learner was doing, recording each learner action with a time stamp. Typical examples of learner actions included selection of objects for experimentation, selection of available tools, <b>mouse</b> <b>moves,</b> mouse drags or clicks on tools or objects, mouse drags when the learner was trying to draw a vector, {{as well as the}} time when the action was performed. After that, expert teachers defined actions related to each type of evidence of learner’s motivational state.|$|E
50|$|Disjointed rollovers: {{when the}} <b>mouse</b> is <b>moved</b> over an image or button, other {{areas on the}} screen change to reflect {{what will happen if}} the user clicks.|$|R
50|$|The {{game is a}} {{traditional}} point-and-click adventure which lets one <b>mouse</b> button <b>move</b> the main character within {{the world and the}} other interact with items and people.|$|R
50|$|Robinson's <b>mouse</b> opossums <b>move</b> along tree {{branches}} and vines {{with the help}} of a prehensile tail and may leap between gaps as they search for fruit and insects.|$|R
