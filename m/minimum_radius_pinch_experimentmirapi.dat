40|$|In Chapter I {{we begin}} by {{considering}} a theorem of J. Dieudonne on the <b>minimum</b> <b>radius</b> of starlikeness {{of a class}} of analytic functions. We give a simple new proof of this theorem. By this new proof also we find the <b>minimum</b> <b>radius</b> of univalence of this class and we determine all the cases which give the <b>minimum</b> <b>radius</b> of univalence and the <b>minimum</b> <b>radius</b> of starlikeness. We then use a method {{similar to that in}} this new proof to obtain the <b>minimum</b> <b>radius</b> of univalence and the <b>minimum</b> <b>radius</b> of starlikeness of some other classes of analytic functions. For each class we determine all the cases giving the <b>minimum</b> <b>radius</b> of univalence and the <b>minimum</b> <b>radius</b> of starlikeness. Then we give some similar results for the <b>minimum</b> <b>radius</b> of convexity. In Chapter II first we deal with Heawood's Lemma which was established and used by P. J. Heawood to prove the theorem known as the Grace-Heawood Theorem. The same lemma was used by S. Kakeya in the proof of another theorem. We show that Heawood's Lemma is false and we give new proofs of these results. Then for some special cases we improve the value of the radius of univalencegiven by Kakeya's Theorem. In this connection we firstgive L. N. Cakalov's result and then we obtain some improvements of his result. In Appendix I we give some examples related with Chapter I and Chapter II. In Appendix II we give an example which shows that there is an error in a paper by M. Robertson. <p...|$|R

50|$|The <b>minimum</b> bend <b>radius</b> is of {{particular}} importance in the handling of fiber-optic cables, which are often used in telecommunications. The <b>minimum</b> bending <b>radius</b> will vary with different cable designs. The manufacturer should specify the <b>minimum</b> <b>radius</b> to which the cable may safely be bent during installation, and for the long term. The former is somewhat smaller than the latter. The <b>minimum</b> bend <b>radius</b> is in general also a function of tensile stresses, e.g., during installation, while being bent around a sheave while the fiber or cable is under tension. If no <b>minimum</b> bend <b>radius</b> is specified, one is usually safe in assuming a <b>minimum</b> long-term low-stress <b>radius</b> not less than 15 times the cable diameter.|$|R
40|$|Abstract for the Final Technical Report, DOE Grant DE-FG 02 - 98 ER 54496 An X-pinch plasma is {{produced}} by driving a high current (100 - 500 kiloamperes) through two or more fine wires that cross and touch at a point, forming an X {{in the case of}} two wires. The wires explode because of the high current, and then the resulting plasma is imploded radially inward by the magnetic field from the current. When the imploding material briefly stagnates at very small radius and high density, an intense burst of x-rays {{is produced}} and the plasma disassembles as rapidly as it imploded. When this project began, we could confidently state that at its <b>minimum</b> <b>radius,</b> X <b>pinch</b> plasmas made from such materials as titanium and molybdenum might be as hot as 10, 000, 000 K and had densities almost as high as the solid wire density, but their X-ray pulse durations were below one billionth of a second. We could also say that the X pinch was useful for point-projection imaging of rapidly changing objects, such as exploding wires, with high resolution, indicative of a very small X-ray source spot size. We can now confidently say that X-pinch plasma temperatures at the moment of the X-ray burst are 10 - 25 million K in titanium, molybdenum and several other wire X-pinches based upon the spectrum of emitted X-rays in the radiation burst. By the same means, {{as well as from the}} penetration of X-rays through the dense plasma, we know that ion densities are close to or higher than one-tenth of the density of the original (solid) wire material in molybdenum and a few other X-pinch plasmas. Furthermore, using the diffraction of X-rays radiated by the X-pinch when it reaches <b>minimum</b> <b>radius,</b> we have determined that the x-ray source size is about 1 thousandth of a millimeter for such wire materials as molybdenum and niobium, while it is 2 - 10 times larger for tungsten, titanium and aluminum wires. Finally, using a very high speed X-ray imaging “streak camera,” we have determined that X pinch X-ray pulses can be as short as 30 trillionths of a second. Additional experiments have demonstrated that a spherical shell of plasma expands away from the cross point region after the x-ray burst. It reaches millimeter scale in a few billionths of a second, leaving a small (less than 0. 1 millimeter) gap in the middle that enables energetic electrons to be accelerated to 10 or a few 10 ’s of kilovolts of energy. In addition to gaining an understanding of the physics of the X pinch plasmas, we have had to develop several new X-ray diagnostic devices in order to obtain and verify the above results. On the non-technical side, 4 students have completed Ph. D. s working under the auspices of this project, including one woman, and another woman has begun her Ph. D. research under this project. In addition, several undergraduate students have worked with us on the X-pinch experiments, including one who is now a graduate student in plasma physics at Princeton University...|$|R

40|$|An {{objective}} {{structure is}} a collection of distinct points having identical physical environments. Such structures are produced by applying a discrete subgroup of an isometry group to a finite set of points. Here the objective structures are generated by the nanotube group and their dynamics are simulated using the Lennard-Jones potential and the velocity Verlet method. These structures are defined by the number of points in a ring, n, and the distance and angular displacement between two consecutive rings, τ and α, respectively. In a typical simulation, the radius of the nanotube oscillates due to interparticle forces. Our analysis shows that for α 0 objective structures achieve the lowest <b>minimum</b> <b>radius</b> at τ σ where σ is a parameter for the Lennard-Jones potential.
