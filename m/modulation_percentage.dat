40|$|Optical {{observations}} of the low mass X-ray binary 4 U 1735 - 44 were obtained during 1997 - 2007 and combined with earlier published observations from 1984 - 1993 to refine the ephemeris for the system. The linear fit for the time of maximum optical light has the ephemeris HJD = 2445904. 0494 (90) + [N x 0. 19383222 (29) ] with a value of chi^ 2 = 253. 5 for 16 dof and a scatter about phase zero of sigma = 0. 061. The new data reconciles {{the discrepancy between the}} previous ephemeris and the more recent spectral ephemeris based on emission from the companion star which defined the systems true dynamical phase zero. The optical maximum for 4 U 1735 - 44 now occurs at spectral phase 0. 47 ± 0. 05 and thus supports the classic model for an LMXB system. Our data further supports the standard model in several ways. The mean optical flux shows a positive correlation with the RXTE ASM X-ray flux, the relative increases suggesting that the non-X-ray induced optical flux from the companion is < 14 percent of the total optical light from the system. There is no apparent trend in the optical <b>modulation</b> <b>percentage</b> with increasing X-ray flux. The X-ray flux for various ASM energy bands shows no evidence of orbital modulation, eclipses or dips when folded using the new ephemeris.

A somatosensory stimulus {{was applied to}} the hindlimb of an achlorolose anesthetized mouse resulting in robust (p < 4 10 3) BOLD changes in somatosensory cortex and large veins. <b>Percentage</b> <b>modulation</b> of the MR signal in cortex exceeded 7 %.

30|$|Moreover, {{adaptive}} modulation provides significant performance enhancement {{especially when}} fixed FEC is employed. For example, adaptive <b>modulation</b> reduces the <b>percentage</b> of playback starvation from 20.85 % in the 16 -QAM video streaming system (the most efficient fixed modulation {{level for the}} assumed channel realization), to 10.07 % when SW-ARQ is used and from 2.44 to 0.23 % when GBN-ARQ is used. For GBN with adaptive FEC, it can be noticed that the performance of 256 -QAM streaming system is the best and matches the performance of adaptive QAM system.|$|R

This thesis documents experiments {{conducted with the}} Gsanger LM 0202 P electro-optic modulator to achieve a high <b>percentage</b> <b>modulation</b> at 125 MHz of an argon-ion laser. The laser was tuned to produce a single mode, linearly polarized light at 514. 5 nm. The laser light was first passed through the electro-optic crystal modulator with no external electric field applied, and the frequency spectrum was observed {{to be the same}} as the frequency spectrum of the source laser. When an AC voltage with a frequency of 125 MHz was applied to the modulator sidebands were observed by using a Fabry-Perot interferometer. Further measurements were taken to determine the suitability of the LM 0202 P modulator over a large frequency range[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The charge {{composition}} and time variations of quiet-time cosmic rays {{in the energy}} range 10 to 25 MeV/nucleon were studied to determine {{the source of the}} enhancement of quiet-time intensities of low energy nitrogen and oxygen nuclei observed by Pioneer 10. Time variations were established from data from IMPs 6, 7, and 8; the charge composition was obtained by summing data from IMP 7 and IMP 8. The neon to carbon ratio present in solar rays is too low to explain an observed enhancement of neon. Helium and oxygen have the same <b>percentage</b> <b>modulation</b> for a range of x 5 in intensity. This can be explained {{within the framework of the}} field-force approximation and the selection mechanism based on the first ionization potential proposed by Fisk et al.

40|$|Abstract: Observationally, it is {{difficult}} to establish at what rigidity the modulation of galactic cosmic rays (CRs) actually begins in the heliosphere. It should be possible to do if the relevant local interstellar CR spectra were known and reliable measurements were made between 10 GV and ∼ 200 GV, inside and outside the heliosphere. Numerical models for solar modulation studies are based on simply assuming that CR modulation begins at a given spatial boundary and at rigidities between 30 - 50 GV, usually handled as an initial condition. The Stochastic Differential Equations approach to numerical modelling presents the opportunity to determine the level of modulation from high to low rigidities because an initial condition at a prescribed high rigidity is not required. We present the results of such an approach and show the <b>percentage</b> <b>modulation</b> of CR protons as a function of kinetic energy between 100 MeV and 250 GeV...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if the actions of progesterone on preterm labor are accomplished through <b>modulation</b> of the <b>percentage</b> of regulatory T-cells (Treg). Methods: The study was a cohort pilot study made in a single center tertiary obstetrical unit with women in preterm labor arrested with tocolytic treatment. Variation of the number and percentage of Treg cells obtained from peripheral blood samples of women with preterm labor were calculated by flow cytometry, before and after progesterone administration. Results: In the paired samples for each patient, there was a significant difference in the Treg cell pool after progesterone treatment, with an increase in both their percentage (48. 9 vs. 53; P = 0. 07) and absolute number (14. 8 vs. 56. 5 cells/μL; P = 0. 046). Conclusions: This research demonstrated a considerable increase in the Treg cell pool after progesterone treatment. This indicates a possible mechanism for progesterone treatment benefits in preterm labor, potentially increasing its more rational use...|$|R

40|$|The role {{of primary}} visual cortex (area V 1) in {{subjective}} perception has intrigued students of vision for decades. Specifically, {{the extent to which}} the activity of different types of cells (monocular versus binocular) and electrophysiological signals (i. e. local field potentials versus spiking activity) reflect perception is still debated. To address these questions we recorded from area V 1 of the macaque using tetrodes during the paradigm of binocular flash suppression, where incongruent images presented dichoptically compete for perceptual dominance. We found that the activity of a minority (20) of neurons reflect the perceived visual stimulus and these cells exhibited perceptual modulations substantially weaker in comparison to their sensory modulation induced by congruent stimuli. Importantly, perceptual modulations were found equally often for monocular and binocular cells, demonstrating that perceptual competition in V 1 involves mechanisms across both types of neurons. The power of the local field pot ential (LFP) also showed moderate perceptual <b>modulations</b> with similar <b>percentages</b> of sites showing significant effects across frequency bands (18 - 22). The possibility remains that perception may be strongly reflected in more elaborate aspects of activity in V 1 circuits (e. g. specific neuronal subtypes) or perceptual states might have a modulatory role on more intricate aspects of V 1 firing patterns (e. g. synchronization), not necessarily altering the firing rates of single cells or the LFP power dramatically...|$|R
40|$|Understanding of the {{transport}} in a Tokamak plasma {{is an important}} issue. Various mechanisms {{have been reported in}} the literature to relate the core phenomenon to edge phenomenon. Sawtooth and Mirnov oscillations caused by MHD instabilities are generally observed in Tokamak discharges. Observation of these effects in the visible radiation from outer edge may offer a possible means to understand {{the transport}}. Oscillations in the visible radiation from outer region of the plasma have been observed during recent Aditya discharges. <b>Percentage</b> <b>modulation</b> of these oscillations vary with the Lines of Sight (LOS) of the chords and surfaces on which they terminate. This has been found in both the low frequency (~ 1 kHz) oscillations that seem to correlate with sawteething in SXR signals and the higher frequency (~ 10 kHz) oscillations that correlate well with Mirnov signals indicative of m/n= 2 / 1 mode rotation. This suggests that the extent to which the MHD instabilities in the central region of the plasma column are reflected in the edge radiation depends on the interaction of the plasma with the surface at the extremity of the LOS. The release of particle/ energy accompanying the MHD instabilities leads to a large influx of particles from such surfaces. Cross-bispectral analysis suggests that a mode (having frequency of ~ 20 kHz) is also generated due to the interaction of m/n= 1 / 1 (~ 10 kHz, seen in SXR) and m/n= 2 / 1 (~ 10 kHz, seen in Mirnov, Visible & Microwave Interferometer signals). By possible selection rules, this mode seems to be a m/n= 3 / 2 mode. This mode is seen in Mirnov, Visible & Interferometer signals. Behaviour of these oscillations on various LOS and their relation to SXR&Mirnov signals can lead to an understanding of the transport phenomenon. These observations and our interpretations will be presented. Comment: 12 th International Congress on Plasma Physics, 25 - 29 October 2004, Nice (France...|$|R
