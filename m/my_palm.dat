2500|$|On July 5, 2008, Tulowitzki {{went back}} on the {{disabled}} list after cutting his right palm in the previous day's 18–17 home win over the Florida Marlins. The injury occurred {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning when Tulowitzki slammed a maple bat into the ground in frustration. The incident took place after he was taken out of the game in that same inning; however, he noted that the frustration leading up to his injury wasn't due to being taken out, saying, [...] "I was a little bit frustrated, not at the move. If anything, I thought it was the right move. I came in the hallway, grabbed a bat, hit it on the ground and the bat exploded in my hand and cut open <b>my</b> <b>palm</b> running up to my index finger." [...] The cut required 16 stitches, but no damage was done to any tendons or nerves. Tulowitzki returned to the Rockies lineup, starting at shortstop, on July 21, 2008, in a 16–10 home loss against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He recorded a career-high five hits during the game, as he went 5-for-5 with one RBI. Also since returning from July 21 he has had 6 multi-hit games in his past 8 games (updated through July 29). During the season in games prior to July 21, Tulowitzki only had six multi-hit games (38 games played, prior to July 21). Tulowitzki ended the 2008 season with a [...]263 batting average, 8 home runs, and 46 RBI in 101 games.|$|E

40|$|Introduction How in {{principle}} {{should we go}} about explaining expressions of emotion? These include such diverse things as smiling and laughing in happiness, jumping for joy, baring your teeth or slamming the door in anger, kicking a chair in frustration, lovingly stroking someone's face, and, out of grief, kissing or caressing the clothes {{of a loved one}} who has just died. Expressions of emotions are, I think, conceptually at a fascinating place between bodily changes which are part of an emotion and reasoned actions out of an emotion. By bodily changes I mean autonomic nervous system responses and hormonal changes such as sweating, change of heart-rate, secretion of adrenalin and so forth, and muscular reactions such as trembling, flinching, and so forth; their exact specification, for each type of emotion, is not my concern here. These changes just happen to us; they are not things which we do or can directly try to do: <b>my</b> <b>palms</b> sweat, but I do not actively sweat <b>my</b> <b>palms,</b> althoug...|$|R

6000|$|I {{was only}} {{conscious}} that we moved around an iron world palpitating with life.

For as I grew sober I did not doubt that with scorn she would have met the wild words that already trembled on my lips.|$|R

He made his teeth meet through the side of it. I seized his own cravat and bound it over his lips. He still mumbled and gurgled, but the noise was covered by the rattle of our wheels. We were passing the minister's house, and there was no candle in the window.|$|E
60|$|In {{the place}} of an oath, a hoarse laugh of derision came out of him. But I was too angry then to note its significance. I slapped his face--nay, boxed it so that <b>my</b> <b>palm</b> stung. I heard his sword {{scraping}} out of the scabbard, and drew mine, stepping back to distance at the same instant. Then, with something of a shudder, I remembered young Atwater, and a 380 brace of other instances of his villany. I looked for the captain. He was gone.|$|E
60|$|We {{had been}} {{stopping}} some months at Klaas's together when business compelled {{me one day}} to ride in to Salisbury. I had ordered some goods for my farm from England which had at last arrived. I had now to arrange for their conveyance from the town to my plot of land--a portentous matter. Just as I was {{on the point of}} leaving Klaas's, and was tightening the saddle-girth on my sturdy little pony, Oom Jan Willem himself sidled up to me with a mysterious air, his broad face all wrinkled with anticipatory pleasure. He placed a sixpence in <b>my</b> <b>palm,</b> glancing about him on every side as he did so, like a conspirator.|$|E
60|$|THE SHE-ANCIENT. One day, when I {{was tired}} of {{learning}} to walk forward with some of my feet and backwards with others and sideways with the rest all at once, I sat on a rock with my four chins resting on four of <b>my</b> <b>palms,</b> and four or my elbows resting on four of my knees. And suddenly it came into my mind that this monstrous machinery of heads and limbs was no more me than my statues had been me, {{and that it was}} only an automaton that I had enslaved.|$|R

6000|$|The old fellow {{sighed and}} shook his head. [...] "You have tried to save me from Simba," [...] he said. [...] "For that I shall reward you. I am a great witch-doctor. Listen to me, white man! I see bad days ahead of you. It is writ in my own blood which I have smeared upon <b>my</b> <b>palm.</b> A god greater even than you will rise up and strike you down.

6000|$|My cabin cowers in the pathless sweep [...] Of {{the terrible}} {{northern}} blast; [...] Above its roof the wild clouds leap [...] And shriek as they hurtle past.

60|$|I can {{remember}} that moment so well. I {{have heard from}} others that a great, sudden blow has dulled their senses. It was not so with me. On the contrary, I saw and heard and thought more clearly than I had ever done before. I {{can remember}} that my eyes caught a little knob of marble as broad as <b>my</b> <b>palm,</b> which was imbedded {{in one of the}} grey stones of the rockery, and I found time to admire its delicate mottling. And yet the look upon my face must have been strange, for Cousin Edie screamed, and leaving me she ran off to the house. I followed her and tapped at the window of her room, for I could see that she was there.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{perhaps it}} was the word [...] "priests" [...] that I carried away with me through the {{darkness}} of another flight in time. Perhaps it was the cue. More probably it was a mere coincidence. At any rate I awoke, lying upon a rough rocky floor, and found myself on my back, my arms crossed in such fashion that each elbow rested in the palm of the opposite hand. As I lay there, eyes closed, half awake, I rubbed my elbows with <b>my</b> <b>palms</b> and found that I was rubbing prodigious calluses. There was no surprise in this. I accepted the calluses as of long time and a matter of course.|$|R
60|$|I flung {{away the}} paper I was still holding. I sat up, I slapped {{the table with}} <b>my</b> open <b>palm.</b> I {{wanted to know why}} he would keep harping on that, my {{absolutely}} private affair. It was exasperating, really.|$|R
60|$|But {{the beams}} or cleats I found myself on {{were not the}} broad, generous ones that at that time were usually on box-cars. On the contrary, they were very narrow--not more than {{an inch and a}} half in breadth. I couldn't get half of the width of my sole on them. Then there was nothing to which to hold with my hands. True, there were the ends of the two box-cars; but those ends were flat, {{perpendicular}} surfaces. There were no grips. I could only press the flats of <b>my</b> <b>palms</b> against the car-ends for support. But that would have been all right if the cleats for my feet had been decently wide.|$|R
