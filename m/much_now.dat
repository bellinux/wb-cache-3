25|$|During the 6th century Greek {{sculpture}} developed rapidly, {{becoming more}} naturalistic, and {{with much more}} active and varied figure poses in narrative scenes, though still within idealized conventions. Sculptured pediments were added to temples, including the Parthenon in Athens, where {{the remains of the}} pediment of around 520 using figures in the round were fortunately used as infill for new buildings after the Persian sack in 480 BCE, and recovered from the 1880s on in fresh unweathered condition. Other significant remains of architectural sculpture come from Paestum in Italy, Corfu, Delphi and the Temple of Aphaea in Aegina (<b>much</b> <b>now</b> in Munich).|$|E
500|$|Connor's {{appearance}} {{as a regular}} in After the Fall, was initially met with dismay by some fans. IDW representative Chris Ryall responded to these complaints with optimism, assuring the fans that the character would win them over, {{just the way he}} has been, by the time the series end. True to his words, After The Fall’s Connor was received positively. Brian Lynch confirmed this in an interview, stating that Connor has not only been the most pleasantly surprising character for him to write, he has been the most surprising for the fans as well, [...] "Connor was a great character on the TV show but, I don’t think he was ever a favorite. But he’s slowly but surely {{become one of the most}} popular characters in After The Fall, which is wonderful." [...] He further said that he himself like the character so <b>much</b> <b>now,</b> he wants to do a book called 'Son of Angel' based on him.|$|E
500|$|After Victoria's {{divorce from}} Ernst, Grand Duke Kirill, whom Victoria {{had seen on}} all her {{subsequent}} visits to Russia, was discouraged by his parents from {{trying to keep a}} close relationship with her. Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna told Kirill to keep Victoria as his mistress and marry someone else. A few months later, war broke out between Russia and Japan. As {{a senior member of the}} navy, Kirill was sent on active service to the front in the Russo-Japanese War. His ship was blown up by a Japanese mine while entering Port Arthur and he was one of the few survivors. Sent home to recover, the Tsar finally allowed him permission to leave Russia and he left for Coburg to be with Victoria. The narrow escape from death had hardened Kirill's determination to marry Victoria. [...] "To those over whom the shadow of death has passed, life has a new meaning," [...] Kirill wrote in his memoirs. [...] "It is like daylight. And I was now within visible reach of fulfillment of the dream of my life. Nothing would cheat me of it now. I had gone through <b>much.</b> <b>Now,</b> at last, the future lay radiant before me." ...|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. James Hunt {{reviewed}} the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in January 2013. He was surprised by the episode as he [...] "went in expecting something that was typically season one awful, and got something that was actually a lot of fun". [...] He thought that the theme of symbiosis between man and machine was [...] "interesting", stating it was the best episode up until that point in season one and one of the best of the season overall. Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club in May 2010. He too was surprised by what he found. Handlen said that [...] "last time I saw it, I thought Riker and Minuet's interactions were cheesy as hell. They didn't bother me so <b>much</b> <b>now,</b> because they don't go on very long, and there's something hilarious about a man trying to seduce a computer simulation designed to respond to his seductions". But he said, [...] "I had fun with this, which I wasn't expecting", and [...] "thought this was solid". He gave the episode a B grade.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "All In My Head (Flex)" [...] fuses reggae and pop with trap music. The song {{is three}} minutes and thirty-seconds {{in length and}} samples the song [...] "Flex" [...] by Jamaican DJ Mad Cobra which itself {{interpolated}} elements of The Temptations' [...] "Just My Imagination". Its instrumentation consists of guitar, percussion, synthesized finger snaps and synths creating an electronic-reggae beat. The song opens with Hansen singing the chorus featuring guitar chords and crisp clicks. Following the rap performed by Fetty Wap, Ally Brooke belts out [...] the first verse: [...] "Curtains like waves closing in all around us, dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us," [...] backed by the percussion and guitar chords. Concerning his collaboration on [...] "All in My Head (Flex)", Fetty Wap told Billboard that during the recording, his voice [...] "wasn't as mature as it is now." [...] And described as [...] "impossible" [...] to performed the song on stage. [...] "Like, I smoke way too <b>much</b> <b>now.</b> No more high-range. If you were actually to hear the first version to that song, I do not sound anything like that. It was way high up there. So when we changed everything I was like I don't think they {{going to like it}} because it felt like I took the energy from it. But they were like we love it, we rocking with it." [...] He expressed.|$|E
2500|$|According to the prosecution, Knox had {{attacked}} Kercher in her bedroom, repeatedly banged {{her head against}} a wall, forcefully held her face, and tried to strangle her. Mignini suggested Knox had taunted Kercher and may have said, [...] "You acted the goody-goody so <b>much,</b> <b>now</b> {{we are going to}} show you. Now you're going to be forced to have sex!" [...] The prosecution theorized that Guede, Knox, and Sollecito had removed Kercher's jeans, and held her {{on her hands and knees}} while Guede sexually abused her; that Knox had cut Kercher with a knife before inflicting the fatal stab wound; and that she had then stolen Kercher's mobile phones and money to fake a burglary. On 5December 2009, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of murder and sentenced to 26 years' imprisonment.|$|E

2500|$|Powerfully built, Marsh was {{regarded}} as an all rounder {{for the majority of}} his career. Coupled with his short stature, his power suited him to the task of keeping wicket. [...] Despite his bulk, which forced him to work heavily on reducing his weight in his early career, he had fast feet movement, combined with fast anticipation and reflexes which allowed him to cover more ground. He raised the role of wicketkeeper to a more prominent status in a team with his acrobatic diving, raucous appeals and habit of throwing a ball high into the air upon completing a dismissal. [...] As the wicketkeeper, he made himself the focal point in the field and attempted to extract higher standards of concentration from both himself and his team-mates. Speaking of his understanding with Lillee, he said [...] "I've played with him so <b>much</b> <b>now</b> that most of the time I know what he is going to do before he has bowled" [...] Marsh said, [...] "I know from the way he runs up; the angle, the speed, where he hits the crease, where the ball is going to be." ...|$|E
