2500|$|A {{free jet}} water turbine or impulse water turbine, also {{commonly}} known as a Pelton's wheel, is a wheel that uses cups, or buckets, that are split down the middle by a <b>metal</b> <b>divider,</b> so that in effect two cups are mounted side-by-side at each [...] "spoke" [...] in the wheel. A high-pressure water jet aimed {{at the center of}} each bucket is split by the divider to hit each of cup, one on the left, the other on the right. The design of this water turbine takes advantage of a mechanics principle known as impulse, a force defined as the product of the force and the time during which it acts. In 1878, Lester Pelton invented his prototype known as the Pelton's wheel, first demonstrating it to miners in the Sierra Nevada. In 1880, Lester Pelton received a patent for his invention.|$|E

50|$|On {{the trip}} back to the FBI office, Corky locks {{himself out of the}} car and the suspect kicks out the <b>metal</b> <b>divider</b> between the front and back seats. The divider jams the gas pedal to the floor, sending the car weaving wildly through city streets. Corky's arm is stuck in the window the whole time. Later, the car crashes into Paulie and Peter. Davis and other agents arrive and proceed to arrest Paulie and Peter, citing {{photographic}} equipment in the backseat of their car (the family mansion was already under watch by the FBI). However, Corky steps in to handle the situation. He farts in the faces of his brothers, and tells them to leave.|$|E
5000|$|A new option {{package was}} a fully padded Cabriolet roof treatment. It {{incorporated}} a landau-style top with bright <b>metal</b> forward <b>divider</b> strip. Another new option package was the d'Elegance package. Similar to the Sixty Special Brougham's package {{of the same}} name, it featured velour upholstery, Deluxe padded doors, front seatback storage pockets, deep pile carpeting, floor mats, see-through standup hood ornament and vinyl tape accent stripes. The [...] "d'Elegance" [...] name remained with the DeVille series as a package through 1984. In 1997 it became a separate model designation for the sedan.|$|R
50|$|Terrazzo {{artisans}} create walls, floors, patios, and panels {{by exposing}} marble chips and other fine aggregates {{on the surface}} of finished concrete or epoxy-resin. Much of the preliminary work of terrazzo workers {{is similar to that of}} cement masons. Marble-chip, cementitious terrazzo requires three layers of materials. First, cement masons or terrazzo workers build a solid, level concrete foundation that is three to four inches deep. After the forms are removed from the foundation, workers add a one-inch layer of sandy concrete. Before this layer sets, terrazzo workers partially embed <b>metal</b> <b>divider</b> strips in the concrete wherever there is to be a joint or change of color in the terrazzo. For the final layer, terrazzo workers blend and place into each of the panels a fine marble chip mixture that may be color-pigmented. While the mixture is still wet, workers toss additional marble chips of various colors into each panel and roll a weighted roller (100-125 lbs.) over the entire surface.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop methods to analyze the offsite consequences of specific sodium fast reactor (SFR) licensing basis events as used to characterize the safety of a nuclear plant design in a license application. An algorithm has been developed which assesses pool heatup, containment load, radionuclide transport, and release from containment during accident scenarios. To analyze temperature transients, the SFR pool has been divided into two, well-mixed regions separated by a <b>metal</b> <b>divider</b> referred to as a redan. Heatup due to fission power or decay heat in the core and heat removal by either the Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) or passive heat removal system drive the energy balance. A reactor kinetics model is also included in this analysis. Radionuclide transport from the cover gas region to containment, as well as the heat and pressure load on containment are analyzed using MELCOR. Subsequent releases from containment to the environment are then analyzed using WinMACCS or Regulatory Guide 1. 145 to calculate offsite consequences. Both WinMACCS and Regulatory Guide 1. 145 employ a Gaussian dispersion model and meteorological dat...|$|E
