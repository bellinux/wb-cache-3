50|$|Annual and {{biennial}} weeds such as chickweed, annual meadow grass, shepherd's purse, groundsel, fat hen, cleaver, speedwell and hairy bittercress propagate themselves by seeding. Many produce {{huge numbers of}} seed several times a season, some all year round. Groundsel can produce 1000 seed, and can continue right through a mild winter, whilst Scentless <b>Mayweed</b> produces over 30,000 seeds per plant. Not all of these will germinate at once, but over several seasons, lying dormant in the soil sometimes for years until exposed to light. Poppy seed can survive 80-100 years, dock 50 or more. There can be many thousands of seeds in a square foot or square metre of ground, thus and soil disturbance will produce a flush of fresh weed seedlings.|$|E
5000|$|The village name {{derives from}} both [...] "Maghefeld" [...] (a field where <b>mayweed</b> grows) and [...] "maid's field"-the village sign depicts a maid. A number of 15th century emigrants {{to the new}} world had the surname May rather than Maid, which {{indicates}} the Middle English [...] "mayde" [...] in signage began as a rebus. Mayfield used {{to be a part of}} the manor of Malling, to the north west of Lewes, which belonged to the Kings of Wessex. Between 823 and 836 CE, King Egbert of Wessex and his son Æthelwulf gave it to Canterbury Cathedral: it became an Archbishop's 'peculiar' in the Diocese of Canterbury, and one of the Archbishop's palaces was built here. It was transferred to the Diocese of Chichester in 1846.|$|E

5000|$|Un porc de câine {{pushed the}} jokes a little further, risking to be branded an obscene work. According to critic Perpessicius, [...] "a witty writer {{can never be}} an obscene writer", and Păstorel had enough talent {{to stay out of}} the pornographic range. Similarly, Cioculescu {{describes}} his friend as an artisan of [...] "libertine humor", adverse to didactic art, and interested only in [...] "pure comedy". In his narrator's voice, Păstorel mockingly complains that the banal was being replaced by the outstanding, making it hard for humorists to find subject matters. Such doubts are dispelled by the intrusion of a blunt, but inspirational, topic: [...] "Can it be true that <b>mayweed</b> is an aphrodisiac?" [...] In fact, Un porc de câine expands Teodoreanu's range beyond the everyday, namely by showing the calamitous, entirely unforeseeable, effects of an erotic farce. The volume also includes a faux obituary, honoring the memory of one Nae Vasilescu. This stuttering tragedian, whose unredeemed ambition was to play Shylock, took his revenge on the acting profession by becoming a real-life usurer—an efficient if dishonorable way to earning the actors' fear and respect.|$|E
