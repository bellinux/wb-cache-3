5|$|Also notable are the spiracles {{on the top}} of the head, which {{suggest the}} {{creature}} had primitive lungs as well as gills. This attribute would have been useful in shallow water, where higher water temperature would lower oxygen content. This development may have led to the evolution of a <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> ribcage, a key evolutionary trait of land-living creatures. The <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> ribcage of Tiktaalik would have helped support the animal’s body any time it ventured outside a fully aquatic habitat. Tiktaalik also lacked a characteristic that most fishes havebony plates in the gill area that restrict lateral head movement. This makes Tiktaalik the earliest known fish to have a neck, with the pectoral girdle separate from the skull. This would give the creature more freedom in hunting prey either on land or in the shallows.|$|E
5|$|Another dromaeosaurid species, Deinonychus antirrhopus, may display partial flight capacities. The {{young of}} this species bore longer arms and <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> {{pectoral}} girdles than adults, and which {{were similar to those}} seen in other flapping theropods, implying that they may have been capable of flight when young and then lost the ability as they grew.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from its}} vertebrae, Acrocanthosaurus had a typical allosauroid skeleton. Acrocanthosaurus was bipedal, with a long, heavy tail {{counterbalancing}} {{the head and}} body, maintaining its center of gravity over its hips. Its forelimbs were relatively shorter and <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> than those of Allosaurus but were otherwise similar: each hand bore three clawed digits. Unlike many smaller fast-running dinosaurs, its femur was longer than its tibia and metatarsals, suggesting that Acrocanthosaurus was not a fast runner. Unsurprisingly, the hind leg bones of Acrocanthosaurus were proportionally <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> than its smaller relative Allosaurus. Its feet had four digits each, although as is typical for theropods, the first was {{much smaller than the}} rest and did not make contact with the ground.|$|E
5|$|In the first, the {{standard}} and <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> scheme (Figure), Bz (benzoyl) protection {{is used for}} A, dA, C, and dC, while G and dG are protected with isobutyryl group. More recently, Ac (acetyl) group is used to protect C and dC as shown in Figure.|$|E
5|$|Indriids {{such as the}} sifakas {{use their}} toothcombs to gouge bark or dead wood (bark-prising), which is done prior to scent-marking with the gland on their chest. The <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> {{structure}} of their toothcomb is thought to help it withstand the compressive forces experienced during regular bark-prising.|$|E

5|$|Males have a long, {{straight}} penis with a notch {{between the}} shaft and the narrow, egg-shaped glans penis. Near the top, the penis is haired, but {{the base is}} almost naked. In the baculum (penis bone), the shaft is long and narrow and slightly curved. The length of the penis and baculum distinguish P.raceyi from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids. P.endoi, P.paterculus, and P.abramus have more similar bacula, but that of P.abramus is more curved, the shaft and the tip are <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> in P.paterculus, and the proximal (near) end is <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> in P.endoi. In males, penis length is 9.6 to 11.8mm (0.38 to 0.46in) and baculum length is 8.8 to 10.0mm (0.35 to 0.39in).|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} connectors {{were designed}} to be <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> than many past connectors. This is because USB is hot-pluggable, and the connectors would be used more frequently, and perhaps with less care, than previous connectors.|$|E
5|$|Tyrant flycatchers are Passerine birds which occur {{throughout}} North and South America.

Most are rather plain. As the name implies, most are insectivorous.|$|E
50|$|In {{performing}} the search, you much choose a database to go through. Such databases include, among others, Swissprot, often used when researching well characterized organisms like humans, mice, and yeasts; and NCBInr for <b>more</b> general, <b>robust</b> searches.|$|R

5|$|A {{study of}} {{seedlings}} grown from seed collected in 28 areas showed a north-south change in leaf shape and dimensions. Seedling leaves get longer and narrower southwards. Seedlings often have leaves with red-brown pigmentation which disappears in older plants, and this coloration becomes increasingly common towards the south. The changes in shape—leaves getting narrower and <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> {{from north to}} south and from lowland to montane—suggest adaptations to colder weather.|$|E

Pocock distinguished A. f. styani from A. f. fulgens by its longer winter coat and greater blackness of the pelage, bigger skull, more strongly curved forehead, and <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> teeth. His description is based on skulls and skins collected in Sichuan, Myitkyina close to the border of Yunnan, and Upper Burma.|$|E

5|$|For {{commercial}} use, varieties with {{a minimum}} stem length of 30cm are sought, making them ideal for cut flowers. Florists require blooms that only open when they reach the retail outlet. For garden plants the objectives are to continually expand the colour palette and to produce hardy forms, {{and there is a}} particular demand for miniature varieties. The cultivars so produced tend to be larger and <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> than the wild types. The main species used in breeding are N. bulbocodium, N. cyclamineus, N. jonquilla, N. poeticus, N. pseudonarcissus, N. serotinus and N. tazetta.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diversity}} of crops {{can be used}} to help protect the environment. Crop varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases can reduce the need for application of harmfulpesticides.While crops that are more vigorous can better compete withweeds whichreduces the need for applyingherbicides. This is shown in a case study completed atAarhus Universityin Denmark which used <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> maize.Drought resistant plants can help save water and reduce the need forirrigation whiledeeper rooting varieties can help stabilize soils; and varieties that are more efficient in their use of nutrients require lessfertilizer.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, two teams, one led by Krzysztof Goździewski and {{the other}} by Francesco Pepe {{independently}} announced four-planet models for the radial velocity measurements of the star, with a new planet (Mu Arae d) in a near-circular orbit lasting approximately 311 days. The new model gives revised parameters for the previously known planets, with lower eccentricity orbits {{than in the previous}} model and including a <b>more</b> <b>robust</b> characterization of the orbit of Mu Arae e.
