5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Mid-County Expressway, in 1996 the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include {{the entire length of the}} existing Northeast Extension, replacing PA 9. The Northeast Extension was built between 1955 and 1957 and was originally projected to continue past Clarks Summit to the New York border; however, I-81 was built between these two points instead. Since the extension, I-476 has been the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway in the United States (surpassing Interstate 495 in Massachusetts), but it <b>may</b> <b>someday</b> be surpassed in length by Interstate 369 in Texas. In fact, it is longer than some mainline interstates (such as Interstate 83 in Maryland and Pennsylvania, Interstate 99 in Pennsylvania, Interstate 12 in Louisiana, Interstate 19 in Arizona, Interstate 97 in Maryland, and Interstate 2 in Texas). Additionally, its numbering is unusual, since auxiliary interstates beginning in even numbers are typically bypasses or loops rather than spurs.|$|E

For example, one of the oldest of these groups is the Acid Rain Retirement Fund (A.R.R.F.), a non-profit, all-volunteer, community educational group. A.R.R.F. has raised money and bid alongside polluters since 1995 for as many allowances as their funds can buy. But instead of using or trading them, A.R.R.F. retires them permanently, taking allowances off the market and keeping sulfur dioxide out of the air.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, {{the song}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. Many reviewers noted similarities to works of early Madonna and Kylie Minogue, {{with the song}} being compared to several of the singers' songs. Jason Damas from PopMatters praised the track for being [...] "a sure contender for future single release", in addition to calling it his [...] "favorite song on the album". He further added: [...] "No Doubt fans who always secretly suspected that Stefani <b>may</b> <b>someday</b> move to become a Madonna-like dance diva will find their proof in this cut, which plagiarizes Kylie Minogue's [...] "Fever" [...] but makes the song even bigger and catchier." [...] Winnie McCroy of The Villager claimed that [...] "Serious" [...] has staying power; he continued: [...] "Despite your best attempts to shake it, you will find yourself humming the chorus", later comparing the track to Madonna's 1992 single [...] "Erotica", and Falco's 1985 single [...] "Rock Me Amadeus". Also in a highly positive review, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine favored [...] "Serious" [...] for [...] "flawlessly recreat the throwaway lyrics, vocal phrasing and background vocals, and synth sounds of the '80s". A critic from Sputnikmusic awarded the recording five out of a five stars, calling it [...] "one of the better songs on the album". The reviewer noted Kanal's role in the song's production: [...] "this song wouldn't be that wonderful without him". Another highly positive review came from Marcus Floyd from Renowned for Sound; in his review of the parent record, he called it [...] "another catchy melody and addictive arrangement from the platinum blonde star". Lisa Haines, a music editor and columnist for BBC, was less favorable in her review, opining that [...] "the cheeky upstart charm Madonna sported in the 80s is embraced to shrewd effect" [...] for the track's duration.|$|E

2500|$|The Tamar field began {{commercial}} production on 30 March 2013 {{after four years}} of extensive development works. The supply of gas from Tamar is expected to provide a boost to the Israeli economy, which has suffered losses of more than NIS20 billion between 2011 and 2013 resulting from the disruption of gas supplies from neighboring Egypt (and which are not expected to resume due to Egypt's decision to indefinitely suspend its gas supply agreement to Israel). As a result, Israel, as well as its other neighbor Jordan, which also suffered from disruption of gas deliveries from Egypt, had to resort to importing significantly more expensive and polluting liquid heavy fuels as substitute sources of energy. While Egyptian gas supplies to Jordan were partially restored in 2013, supplies from Tamar, and in the future from the Leviathan field, are expected to satisfy all Israeli domestic natural gas needs for decades to come. Moreover, due to the erratic supply of gas from Egypt, Jordan has reportedly been considering signing an agreement to import gas from Israel. While less desirable to the kingdom from a political standpoint, such an agreement represents the most expedient and least costly option for Jordan to compensate for its loss of Egyptian gas. [...] The energy shortages in Egypt which led it to curtail its exports of natural gas mean that Egypt too <b>may</b> <b>someday</b> obtain natural gas from Israel, though so far Egypt has rejected such deals on political grounds, despite the fact that procuring gas from Israel would be significantly cheaper than from other sources of imported natural gas.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of genetic fingerprinting {{in the late}} 20th century means that if cell samples from a cheek swab are collected from service personnel prior to deployment to a combat zone, identity can be established using even a small fragment of human remains. Although {{it is possible to}} take genetic samples from a close relative of the missing person, it is preferable to collect such samples directly from the subjects themselves. It is a fact of warfare that some combatants are likely to go missing in action and never be found. However, by wearing ID tags and using modern technology the numbers involved can be considerably reduced. In addition to the obvious military advantages, conclusively identifying the remains of missing service personnel is highly beneficial to the surviving relatives. Having positive identification makes it somewhat easier {{to come to terms with}} their loss and move on with their lives. Otherwise, some relatives may suspect that the missing person is still alive somewhere and <b>may</b> return <b>someday.</b> However, many of these identifying procedures are not typically used for combatants who are members of militias, mercenary armies, insurrections, and other irregular forces.|$|R
