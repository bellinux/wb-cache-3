40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} in marrow stem cell purification, controversy {{about the nature and}} heterogeneity of cells with the potential for long-term repopulation of lymphoid and <b>myeloid</b> <b>tissues</b> remains. Essential to the resolution of these questions is the use of strategies to track the progeny produced in vivo from individual hemopoietic stem cells in purified populations. We have used a procedure for obtaining highly enriched populations of stem cells with competitive repopulating ability from male mice (pretreated with 5 -fluorouracil), and in this paper we present the results of studies in which small numbers (150 - 2000) of these cells were exposed to supernatant containing a helper-free recombinant retrovirus carrying the neomycin-resistance gene and then were transplanted together with 2 x 10 (5) "compromised" female marrow cells into irradiated female recipients. Male cells [...] i. e., progeny of purified stem cells [...] were found in {{one or more of the}} tissues examined (peripheral blood, marrow, spleen, and thymus) in 28 of 28 mice evaluated at various times between 35 and 196 days after transplantation. In 20 of these mice (71 %), the neomycin-resistance gene was also detected, although not always at a level that correlated with the proportion of male cells. Analysis of spleen colonies (day 12) generated in secondary recipients confirmed that viral integration was confined to male repopulating cells. In three mice direct evidence of a common clone in both lymphoid and <b>myeloid</b> <b>tissues</b> was also obtained. These results show the feasibility of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer to highly purified populations of lympho-myelopoietic stem cells with long-term (6 months) repopulating potential by using a supernatant infection protocol.

The study {{has revealed that}} serous exudation or seroexudative-histolytic reaction of the angibmesenchymal tissue of bone and bone marrow followed by hyperplasia of <b>myeloid</b> <b>tissue</b> {{as well as its}} extension to bone tissue, or myeloid metaplasia of the angiomesenchymal tissue of bone takes plase following the antigenic stimulations. The aforementioned process becomes manifest in the course of prolonged and repeated antigenic stimulations. In the later or terminal stage, hyperplasia of <b>myeloid</b> <b>tissue</b> subsides and falls into exhaustion, i. e., atrophy or mild fibrosis (one rabbit, 322 experimental days). In some instances, however, marked hyperplasia accompanied with structural alteration (2 ̆ 2 Splenoides Mark 2 ̆ 2) is followed by fibrillosis and fibrosis even in the earlier stage (4 rabbits, 39, 108, 120, and 236 days). Extensive or pathy inflammatory exudation and following fibrosis also appear in the course of prolonged sensitization (6 rabbits, 40, 83, 114, 118, 164, and 232 days).

40|$|Sturgeon are {{harvested}} worldwide for their meat and eggs, sold as caviar and {{are among the}} most economically important fish species worldwide. A generally low physiological response to external stimuli/stressors has been documented in these phylogenetically primitive species. Considering how little is known about sturgeon immune responses, it is important to study how they respond to such stimuli/stressors. The culture of sturgeon larvae is associated with a high mortality rate during and after yolk sac absorption and onset of feeding. Therefore, it is relevant to study the immune competence of larvae and juvenile sturgeon and determine when their immune organs first appear and how they develop. The meningeal <b>myeloid</b> <b>tissue,</b> the spleen and the thymus were characterized morphologically by light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) during the first 5 months of life (until 2895 growing degree days, °C. day (dd)). In sturgeon, the spleen was first visible approximately 400 dd after the onset of feeding (at 541 dd) and the meningeal <b>myeloid</b> <b>tissue</b> and the thymus at 768 dd after the onset of feeding; these first appeared between 541 dd and 768 dd, respectively. Heterophil and eosinophil percentages were significantly greater in the meningeal <b>myeloid</b> <b>tissue</b> of larger fish (950 and 2895 dd, respectively) when compared with the smaller fish. The percentages of reticular cells were significantly higher in the smallest fish than in the larger fish and the undifferentiated cells were higher in the youngest animals compared to the older age groups. Likewise, the splenic heterophil percentages were significantly higher in the oldest fish (2895 dd) compared to the youngest fish (768 dd). The splenic undifferentiated cell percentages were significantly higher in the younger fish compared to the oldest. This emphasizes less developed immune organs in the smaller animals. Lymphocyte percentages did not change over time in these tissues. In the thymus, lymphocytes were the predominant cell type and only the undifferentiated cell percentages were significantly different and highest in the oldest group, possibly reflecting a more proliferative thymus in these animals. In order to characterize changes in cell populations in relevant immune organs, a temperature trial was done in juvenile shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum), kept at 11 °C or at 20 °C. Relevant immune organs such as the meningeal <b>myeloid</b> <b>tissue,</b> the spleen, the thymus and the skin were studied. A higher temperature had a significant positive influence on the immune cell production in the meningeal <b>myeloid</b> <b>tissue</b> (higher lymphocyte, eosinophil and heterophil percentages). Likewise, temperature resulted in an initial but transient increase in splenic white pulp percentage. A similar effect was seen for splenic expression of interferon regulatory factors 1 and 2 (IRF- 1 and IRF- 2) and no changes occurred in matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP- 9) expression for both spleen and skin. IRF- 1 and IRF- 2 expression in the skin were significantly higher expression in the fish kept at 11 °C at 3 and 6 weeks post temperature change. There were no differences in thymus size between the different groups. Further research is required to better characterize the nature of these immune responses in these organs. These findings suggest that an effective immune response may not occur in early life stages prior and during the onset of feeding but {{further research is needed to}} further assess this. Rearing sturgeon juveniles at higher temperatures (up to 20 °C) may be beneficial for sturgeon aquaculture, since it maximizes growth rates and positively influences immune cell percentages in relevant immune organs...|$|E

The animals were euthenized after 10, 20 and 30 days, respectively and tendon samples were taken for histopathologic examinations. Histopathologic observation demonstrated that Bone Marrow injections resolved edema, swelling and inflammatory cell infiltration in injured tendons. Also different degrees of increased fibroblast hypercellularity and vascularity were seen.

The patient complained of lumbago and gross hematuria in October, 1981 and consulted a local doctor who pointed out a right ureteral stone and downward deviation of the left kidney. The patient was referred to our hospital for further examination. An echogram showed a high echogenic mass in the left flank which was compressing the spleen and the kidney. A CT scan revealed a large mass with heterogeneous low density contents. The mass was lobulated into several parts and their density suggested fat tissue. An aortogram showed an avascular mass and an adrenal venogram showed multiple veins which radiated to the periphery.

These responses were studied in 2 different sizes of same age juvenile sturgeon kept at either 11 °C or 20 °C (4 treatment groups), before and after exposure to an ectoparasitic copepod (Dichelesthium oblongum). Based on a differential cell count, temperature was found to strongly influence immune cell production in the meningeal <b>myeloid</b> <b>tissue,</b> regardless of the fish sizes considered. Morphometric analysis of splenic white pulp showed a transient response to temperature. There were no differences between the groups in the morphometric analysis of thymus size. Splenic IRF- 1 and IRF- 2 had similar expression profiles, significantly higher in fish kept at 20 °C for the first 6 weeks of the study but not by 14 weeks. In the skin, IRF- 1 was significantly higher in the fish kept at 11 °C over the first 6 weeks of the study.

40|$|Venezuelan equine {{encephalitis}} (VEE) virus is a mosquito-borne alphavirus associated with sporadic outbreaks in human and equid {{populations in the}} Western Hemisphere. After the bite of an infected mosquito, the virus initiates a biphasic disease: a peripheral phase with viral replication in lymphoid and <b>myeloid</b> <b>tissues,</b> followed by a neurotropic phase with infection of central nervous system (CNS) neurons, causing neuropathology {{and in some cases}} fatal encephalitis. The mechanisms allowing VEE virus to enter the CNS are currently poorly understood. Previous data have shown that the virus gains access to the CNS by infecting olfactory sensory neurons in the nasal mucosa of mice. However, at day 5 after inoculation, the infection of the brain is multifocal, indicating that virus particles are able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To better understand the role of the BBB during VEE virus infection, we used a well-characterized mouse model system. Using VEE virus replicon particles (VRP), we modeled the early events of neuroinvasion, showing that the replication of VRP in the nasal mucosa induced the opening of the BBB, allowing peripherally administered VRP to invade the brain. Peripheral VEE virus infection was characterized by a biphasic opening of the BBB. Further, inhibition of BBB opening resulted in a delayed viral neuroinvasion and pathogenesis. Overall, these results suggest that VEE virus initially enters the CNS through the olfactory pathways and initiates viral replication in the brain, which induces the opening of the BBB, allowing a second wave of invading virus from the periphery to enter the brain...|$|R

The amount of viable hematopoietic tissue plays a fundamental role in determining whether the patient is able to undergo further antineoplastic therapy, particularly chemotherapy. We examined 35 patients who had been treated with radiotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma (12), uterine cervix carcinoma (nine), ovarian dysgerminoma (six), testicular seminoma (four), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (four). We observed that radiation-induced modifications of the MRI pattern in the bone marrow are tightly linked to two parameters; the administered radiation dose and the length of time passed after the treatment. Bone marrow recovery was observed only when patients were treated with doses lower than 50 Gy. The earlier radiation-induced modifications of the bone marrow MRI pattern occurred 6 to 12 months after irradiation, and they were most evident 5 to 6 years after the treatment.

In many target tissues, however, the final response to androgens appears to be more complex. Here, cell-selective knockout technology offers a platform upon which we can begin to unravel the more complex interplay and signaling pathways of androgens. A prototypic example is the analysis of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in many accessory sex glands. Furthermore, for some actions of testosterone, in which part of the effect is mediated by the active metabolite 17 β-estradiol, conditional knockout technology offers a novel strategy to study the relative contribution of AR and estrogen receptor-mediated signaling. The latter approach has already resulted in a better understanding of androgen action in brain and bone. Finally, cell-selective knockout technology has generated valuable models to search for AR-controlled molecular mediators of androgen action, a strategy that has successfully been applied to the study of androgen action in the testis and in the epididymis. Although some conditional knockout models have provided clear answers to physiologic questions, it should be noted that others have pointed to unexpected complexities or technical limitations confounding interpretation of the results. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY-RF mice were {{irradiated}} {{with a high}} {{sublethal dose}} (530 rads) of X rays and treated with CS 7 BL spleen cells, bone marrow, or both. Administration of spleen cells produced high mortality attributable to an acute graft-versus-host reaction and <b>myeloid</b> <b>tissue</b> depletion. Administration of bone marrow cells produced transient chimerism and, occasionally I midlethal dose effect. Treatment with mixed cell inocula containing 5 - 10 X 106 spleen cells and 30 - 40 X 106 bone marrow cells resulted in development of a chronic wasting syndrome terminating in death 1 - 2 months after treatment. In these mice, chimerism was more frequently present than in mice receiving bone marrow only. It is concluded that allogeneic immunocompetent cells may promote the take of a simultaneously ad-ministered bone morrow graft by reinforcing irradiation damage to the recipient's hematopoietic: tissue. This {{may result in a}} c:hronic: secondary disease. -J Nat Cancer Inst 41 : 439 - 450, 1968. IN AN attempt to treat mice bearing a transplant-able myeloid leukemia with sublethal irradiation and injection of allogeneic spleen and bone marrow cells, a bimodal mortality pattern was consistendy observed (1). This mortality occasionally had its onset 10 - 20 days after the treatment, but usually occurred after several weeks ' delay. Mice that died in the second period were chimeras. This suggested that the early mortality was caused by an acute secondary disease, and the late mortality by a chronic secondary disease. Chronic secondary disease is a well-known conse-quence of foreign bone marrow transplantation into lethally irradiated mice (2). Sublethally ir-radiated mice are generally thought to reject the grafted marrow (3, 4) or to die from an acute 307 - 400 [...] 68 [...] 28 graft-versus-host reaction when allogeneic spleen and lymph node cells are given in addition to bone marrow (5) ...|$|E

VEGF can ease nervous tissue harm after spinal cord injury (SCI). This study aims to explore whether low-energy ESWT can promote expression of VEGF, protect nervous tissue after SCI, and improve motor function. Methods: Ninety adult female rats were divided into the following groups: Group A (simple laminectomy), Group B (laminectomy and low-energy ESWT), Group C (spinal cord injury), and Group D (spinal cord injury and low-energy ESWT). Impinger was used to cause thoracic spinal cord injury. Low-energy ESWT was applied as treatment after injury three times a week, for 3  weeks. After SCI, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale {{was used to evaluate}} motor function over a period of 42  days at different time points. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to evaluate nerve tissue injury. Neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) staining was also used to evaluate loss of neurons. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of VEGF and its receptor fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt- 1). Immunostaining was used to evaluate VEGF protein expression level in <b>myeloid</b> <b>tissue.</b> Results: BBB scores of Groups A and B showed no significant result related to dyskinesia. HE and NeuN staining indicated that only using low-energy ESWT could not cause damage of nervous tissue in Group B. Recovery of motor function at 7, 35, and 42 days after SCI in Group D was better than that in Group C (P< 0. 05). Compared with Group C, number of NeuN-positive cells at 42 days after SCI increased significantly (P< 0. 05). The mRNA levels of VEGF and Flt- 1 and VEGF expression at 7 days after SCI in Group D were significantly higher than those in Group C (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Low-energy ESWT promotes expression of VEGF, decreases secondary damage of nerve tissue, and improves recovery of motor function. It can be regarded as one mode of clinical routine adjunctive therapy for spinal injury. Keywords: spinal injury, impact wave, VEGF, Flt- 1, nerve protectio...|$|E
5000|$|Phospholipidosis is a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{characterized by}} the excess accumulation of phospholipids in tissues. [...] Many cationic amphiphilic drugs, including anti-depressants, antianginal, antimalarial, and cholesterol-lowering agents, are reported to cause drug-induced phospholipidosis (DIPL) in animals and humans. The mechanisms of DIPL involve trapping or selective uptake of DIPL drugs within the lysosomes and acidic vesicles of affected cells. Drug trapping {{is followed by a}} gradual accumulation of drug-phospholipid complexes within the internal lysosomal membranes. The increase in undigested materials results in the abnormal accumulation of multi-lammellar bodies (<b>myeloid</b> bodies) in <b>tissues.</b>|$|R
