Flanking is useful because a force's offensive power is concentrated in its front. Therefore, to circumvent a force's front and attack a flank is to concentrate offense in the area when the enemy is least able to concentrate offense.|$|R
40|$|Inverse {{simulation}} allows system inputs to {{be found}} to give model outputs that match required time histories. Examples include inputs needed for specific aircraft <b>manoeuvres</b> or <b>movements</b> of a robot arm and such cases lead to investigations that differ from conventional simulation studies. Inverse simulation {{has been used for}} aircraft and helicopter flight mechanics modelling for some time and provides alternatives to analytical methods of inverse modelling used in control applications. The approach is suitable for linear and nonlinear multi-input multi-output models as well as for single-input single-output descriptions. Methods include a so-called “differentiation” approach, techniques that are termed “integration” methods, approaches involving the solution of differential algebraic equations and a method based on feedback system principles. The feedback approach is given particular emphasis, through an example involving a dynamic model of an unmanned underwater vehicle...|$|R
40|$|In Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), {{electrical}} energy is applied and {{measured at the}} boundary of a medium to produce an image of its internal conductivity distribution. When imaging pulmonary ventilation, rib cage expansion and body posture introduce severe image artefacts in the reconstructed images due to electrode position error. This thesis proposes a method to reduce such artefacts by determining the net displacement of electrodes between measurement frames, and effectively, adjusting the geometry of the reconstruction model. A novel regularization method is proposed and validated using data acquired from simulation, phantom, and human in vivo measurements. The proposed method reduces artefacts by more than 70 % in simulated reconstructions and phantom experiments. The in vivo images reveal the various breathing <b>manoeuvres</b> and thoracic <b>movements</b> recorded. Furthermore, the displacement of each electrode is calculated, indicating the deformed boundary shape. This thesis supports EIT for clinical diagnostics and monitoring of pulmonary ventilation...|$|R

40|$|In this contribution, we {{deal with}} the {{methodology}} of visualisation of terrain surface, on which experimental measurements of driving manoeuvres of an agricultural technological vehicle MT 8 - 222 were performed. The introduced methodology uses a defined approach when determining the dynamic stability of agricultural vehicles following the standard STN 47 017. Records of the centre of gravity accelerations were obtained from driving manoeuvres at every instance of time during the drive. From records of accelerations and by using Euler‘s parameters with respect to the inertial system, there were evaluated contact points of the wheel with the terrain. Performed driving <b>manoeuvres</b> consisted of <b>movement</b> in the direction of down grade slope {{as well as in the}} direction of tractive movement on the slope. We created a model of terrain surface in the Surfer® program from obtained experimental data. Next, by using supporting commands in Matlab®, we created an algorithm for visualisation of terrain surface. Following this algorithm, there was created another model of terrain surface.

5000|$|During {{the course}} of the war the British army {{conducted}} large scale mock battles at Warley and Coxheath camps in southern England. The primary motivation behind this was in preparation for the threatened invasion. By all accounts the camps were massive in scale involving upwards of 18,000 men. One militia officer wrote to his friend in August 1778: [...] "We are frequently marched out in considerable bodies to the heaths or commons adjacent, escorted by the artillery, where we go through various <b>movements,</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> and firings of a field of battle. In these expeditions, let me assure you, there is much fatigue, and no little danger...the most grand and beautiful imitations of action are daily presented to us; and believe me, the army in general are becoming greatly enamoured by war." [...] The maneuvers carried out at Warley camp were subject of a painting by Philip James de Loutherbourg known as Warley Camp: The Mock Attack, 1779. He also drew detailed illustrations of the uniforms of the light infantry and grenadiers present at the camp which are considered some of the most accurate surviving illustrations of 18th century British soldiers.|$|R

40|$|Nomadic {{pastoralism}} {{is a form}} {{of animal}} husbandry characterised by movement. Herders and their animals move across the tundra and taiga displaying a curious dichotomous relationship of control by and response to each other. This field based research – carried out among Komi nomadic reindeer herders of the Russian far north – examines how Komi pastoral nomads choose a particular time, route and length of migration. This was explored by using anthropological as well as ecological methods to (i) identify how social and political change and environmental variability influence the reindeers’ and herders’ movements alike and (ii) examine how nomadic movements occur in relation to non-ecological and ecological factors. It was found that there were essentially two types of human/animal movements; individual movements (made by the duty herder and his herd) and collective movements (made by the brigade). Both types of movement, in time and space, were fundamentally dependent upon herding skill and knowledge, and herd control: (a) the duty herder’s ability to maintain herd cohesion and (b) the general aim of preventing harm befalling the herd (by avoiding dangerous terrain). The duty herder’s selection of pastures was, therefore, made mainly according to where reindeer were the easiest to control. It was also found that individual movements could best be understood as emanating from the interplay between reindeer behaviour and the duty herder’s actions. This interplay is best described as being the duty herder’s skilful perception of and response to ethological changes, as advocated by Tim Ingold. Its main principle is based on the duty herder’s maintenance of herd cohesion, within a restricted territory, which has minimal impact upon reindeer behaviour, and which is achieved through skilful <b>manoeuvring.</b> Collective <b>movements</b> could best be described as a means of providing duty herders with the necessary space in which to manoeuvre their herds with the minimum recourse to herding techniques (such as grouping and re-grouping, stopping and turning the herd), and the avoidance of undesirable pasturing areas. A new model for analysing nomadic pastoralist movement – focusing on the interrelations between nomads and their animals and the impacts that individual factors have upon it – is proposed.

40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} {{movement}} of liquid cargo in a road tanker in two road manoeuvres - steady state turning and an evasive <b>manoeuvre.</b> Simulations of <b>movement</b> were performed by two methods: a pendulum {{model and the}} Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model Tis Isat were used. Movements of the fluid gravity centre were compared for various heights of liquid in the circular tanker during the chosen manoeuvres. The agreement of results was satisfactory. Therefore, we can consider the two methods comparable. Two reference pendulum models of overturning were chosen and tested. A new overturning model using the SPH modelling results was developed. Simulations of rollover threshold were performed with all three models for the first described manoeuvre. The results of the static pendulum model are {{significantly higher than the}} results obtained with the dynamic models. The SPH results are slightly higher, but still comparable to the dynamic pendulum method. The possible reasons for the discrepancies between the SPH and the dynamic pendulum methods are from different description of fluid itself and phenomena that cannot be described by pendulum methods (sloshing, mixing, interaction between fluid particles, and friction at the wall-fluid boundary. Mathematical models based on pendulum method are well established for simulating both the dynamic effects of fluid sloshing inside tankers and the rollover threshold of vehicles with liquid cargo, while the SPH method has not yet been used for such simulations. ...|$|R
40|$|Public policy {{conflicts}} emerge when {{feelings of}} scarcity and different interests dominate interactive process among {{the government and}} the public. The stakeholders struggle in a lower violence capacity but broad range of conflicting issues. Thus, some parties may use cooperative or/and competitive conflict management approaches to achieve their goals. This thesis argues that different political structures influence the use of different conflict management mechanisms in managing public policy conflicts. The constitutions, social cultures and national political competitions are a few among the many factors that may <b>manoeuvre</b> a stakeholder’s <b>movement</b> and strategies in the conflict management process. Thailand (liberal democracy) and Malaysia (semi-authoritarian) are the comparative cases, which will be examined in this article. The economic achievements and fast industrialization process have increased the development in these two countries. Large-scale water development projects, particularly hydroelectric power plants have been constructed to fill in the energy gap. However, the hydroelectric projects have caused conflicts between the policy maker and the public. Opposition from affected villagers, NGOs and society members is manifested through demonstrations and lobbying activities. Nevertheless, although both countries face similar conflict situations, the regime’s conflict management responses are differ very much from each other. Here, it is suggested that the political structure design of the liberal democratic country tended to allow better public participation in the conflict management process, where the public was able to consolidate and organise open demonstrations to pressure the regime. On the other hand, the authoritarian regime reacted with a more suppressive approach by using the stick and carrot approach to prevent the escalation of the conflicts. Laws, regulations and force were used to restrict the public from any open opposition. As conclusion, political structure does influence stakeholders’ conflict management approaches particularly in public policy conflicts...|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the terror}} and {{unprecedented}} propaganda, the last free General Elections of 5 March 1933, while resulting in 43.9% failed {{to bring the}} majority for the NSDAP that Hitler had hoped for. Together with the German National People's Party (DNVP), however, {{he was able to}} form a slim majority government. With accommodations to the Catholic Centre Party, Hitler succeeded in convincing a required two-thirds of a rigged Parliament to pass the Enabling act of 1933 which gave his government full legislative power. Only the Social Democrats voted against the Act. The Enabling Act formed the basis for the dictatorship, dissolution of the Länder; the trade unions and all political parties other than the Nazi Party were suppressed. A centralised totalitarian state was established, no longer based on the liberal Weimar constitution. Germany left the League of Nations. The coalition parliament was rigged on this fateful 23 March 1933 by defining the absence of arrested and murdered deputies as voluntary and therefore cause for their exclusion as wilful absentees. Subsequently, in July the Centre Party was voluntarily dissolved in a quid pro quo with the Pope under the anti-communist Pope Pius XI for the Reichskonkordat; and by these <b>manoeuvres</b> Hitler achieved <b>movement</b> of these Catholic voters into the Nazi party, and a long-awaited international diplomatic acceptance of his regime. It is interesting to note, however, that according to Professor Dick Geary the Nazis gained a larger share of their vote in Protestant areas than in Catholic areas, in the elections held between 1928 and November 1932. The Communist Party was proscribed in April 1933. On the weekend of 30 June 1934, he gave order to the SS to seize Röhm and his lieutenants, and to execute them without trial (known as the Night of the Long Knives). Upon Hindenburg's death on 2 August 1934, Hitler's cabinet passed a law proclaiming the presidency to be vacant and transferred the role and powers of the head of state to Hitler as Führer (Leader) and Chancellor.|$|R
40|$|During the Second World War, {{training}} was the Canadian Army’s longest sustained activity. Aside from isolated engagements at Hong Kong and Dieppe, the Canadians did not fight in a protracted campaign until {{the invasion of}} Sicily in July 1943. The years that Canadian infantry units spent training in the United Kingdom were formative {{in the history of}} the Canadian Army. Despite what much of the historical literature has suggested, training succeeded in making the Canadian infantry capable of succeeding in battle against German forces. Canadian infantry training showed a definite progression towards professionalism and away from a pervasive prewar mentality that the infantry was a largely unskilled arm and that training infantrymen did not require special expertise. From 1939 to 1941, Canadian infantry training suffered from problems ranging from equipment shortages to poor senior leadership. In late 1941, the Canadians were introduced to a new method of training called “battle drill,” which broke tactical <b>manoeuvres</b> into simple <b>movements,</b> encouraged initiative among junior leaders, and greatly boosted the men’s morale. The Canadians participated in numerous military exercises of varying sizes that exposed problems with their senior leadership. The replacement of unsuitable officers greatly enhanced the fighting potential of Canadian units and formations. As time went on, infantry training became more rigorous and realistic, and tactical concepts became increasingly sophisticated. By the time of the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, infantry {{training was}} intense, suited to units’ assigned tasks, and highly technical, which belied the false prewar assumption that the infantry was an unskilled arm. By the time Canadian divisions entered battle, they were as prepared as they would ever be. The exception to this was the training of the overseas reinforcement units, which reached an acceptable standard only in the last months of the war. This study ultimately represents a substantial contribution to understanding the history of the Canadian Army and its role in the Second World War...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a research study performed lock gates. It concerns the downstream lock {{gates of the}} one of the four new locks planned {{within the framework of the}} “Seine-Escaut Est (SEE) ” project in the Walloon Region of Belgium. At the stage of the basic preliminary design, it was decided to use four identical gates, all suspended and <b>manoeuvred</b> by lateral <b>movement.</b> On this basis, the present work tackles with different aspects of the lock gate study. The aim is double: on one hand, to advance in the study of the solution of the four downstream lock gates of the SEE project, and the other hand, to concentrate more particularly on the lock gate analysis, among which their design, optimization and structural behavior in the case of ship impact. We began with the design and optimization of the gate. This work was realized with the LBR 5 lock gate optimization software, according to a method comparing a representative number of optimized solutions considering at the same time the cost and weight aspects of the structure. This method leaded to an optimized solution of the downstream gate on which further studies are concentrated. Indeed this optimized gate was modeled with the non linear finite elements software FINELG. This program was used to conduct a non linear numerical analysis of the effect of a boat impact on the downstream gate. Several analyses were performed that allowed us to discuss on the influence of the stiffener dimensions and the influence of the impact zone on the gate structural behavior submitted to the impact. Two different behaviors have been brought to light, a ductile one and a fragile one. The results of the numerical analysis with finite elements have underlined the importance of the development of a global plastic mechanism with the purpose of dissipating a large amount of energy. Finally, we have used an analytical model to calculate the gate theoretical strength in a case of a ship impact, and to compare this value with the FEM numerical analysis results. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present dissertation was to analyse the subcortical implications in the preparation and execution of complex voluntary movements. Three different tasks were selected on purpose. They all are everyday activities which although functionally related have differential characteristics. The first task was the sit-to-stand <b>manoeuvre.</b> Simple ballistic <b>movements</b> are executed faster in reaction time task paradigms when the imperative signal {{is accompanied by a}} startling auditory stimulus (SAS). We examined whether this effect also occurs in complex movements such as the sit-to-stand manoeuvre, taking into account both anticipatory postural adjustments and prime movers. Reaction time was significantly shortened when SAS was applied at an interval of 0 ms with respect to the imperative signal. The onset latency of EMG bursts recorded from tibialis anterior, lumbar paraspinal, quadriceps and biceps femoris muscles reduced proportionally to the shortening of take-off. However, these effects were not observed if SAS was delivered 150 ms after the imperative signal, when the manoeuvre had already started. Our results suggest that stimuli acting on subcortical motor structures speed-up but do not otherwise interfere with the execution of the motor programs. The second task was gait initiation followed by gait-pattern. Human gait involves a repetitive leg motor pattern that emerges after gait initiation. While the automatic maintenance of the gait-pattern may be under the control of subcortical motor centres, gait initiation requires the voluntary launching of a different motor program. We sought to examine how the two motor programmes respond to an experimental manipulation of the timing of gait initiation. Subjects were instructed to start walking as soon as possible at the perception of an imperative signal that, in some interspersed trials, was accompanied by a SAS. We recorded the gait phases and the EMG activity of four muscles from the leg that initiates gait. In trials with SAS, latency of all gait initiation-related events showed a significant shortening and the bursts of EMG activity had higher amplitude and shorter duration than in trials without SAS. The events related to gait-pattern were also advanced but otherwise unchanged. The fact that all the effects of SAS were limited to gait initiation suggests that startle selectively can affect the neural structures involved in gait initiation. Additionally, the proportional advancement of the gait-pattern sequence to the end of gait initiation supports the view that gait initiation may actually trigger the inputs necessary for generating the gait-pattern sequence. The third task was obstacle avoidance during walking. We hypothesized that inducing a StartReact effect may be beneficial in obstacle avoidance under time pressure, when subjects have to perform fast gait adjustments. Subjects walked on a treadmill and obstacles were released in specific moments of the step cycle. On average the EMG onset latency in the biceps femoris shortened by 20 % while amplitude increased by 50 %, in trials in which an auditory startle accompanied obstacle avoidance. The presentation of a startle increased the probability of using a long step strategy, enlarged stride length modifications and resulted in higher success rates, to avoid the obstacle. We also examined the effects of the startle in a condition in which the obstacle was not present in comparison to a condition in which the obstacle was visibly present but it did not fall. In the latter condition, the obstacle avoidance reaction occurred with a similar latency but smaller amplitude as in trials in which the obstacle was actually released. Our results suggest that the motor programmes used for obstacle avoidance are likely stored at subcortical structures. The release of these motor programmes by a SAS may combine intersensory facilitation and the StartReact effect. El objetivo general de la presente tesis doctoral fue analizar las implicaciones subcorticales en la preparación y ejecución de movimientos voluntarios complejos. Se seleccionaron intencionadamente tres tareas. Las tres son actividades de la vida diaria relacionadas entre sí a nivel funcional pero con características diferenciales únicas. La primera tarea fue el paso de sedestación a bipedestación, como una actividad de tiempo de reacción simple para analizar los ajustes posturales anticipatorios y la coordinación muscular. Los resultados de este estudio sugieren que un estímulo auditivo de alta intensidad, que actúa a nivel de las estructuras motoras subcorticales, anticipa, aunque no interfiere, la ejecución de los programas motores. La segunda tarea fue el inicio de la marcha seguido del patrón de locomoción, como una actividad compleja para añadir el análisis de un patrón motor precedido de otro. El hecho de que todos los efectos del estímulo auditivo de alta intensidad estuvieran vinculados al inicio de la marcha sugiere que dicho estímulo subcortical puede afectar de forma selectiva a las estructuras implicadas en el inicio de la marcha. Además, la anticipación proporcional de la secuencia del patrón de locomoción, respecto a la finalización del inicio de la marcha, refuerza la idea de que el inicio de la marcha pueda ser el estímulo de entrada (input) necesario para la generación del patrón de locomoción humana. Finalmente, la tercera tarea fue la evitación de obstáculos durante la marcha para analizar las respuestas electivas en una situación dinámica. Los resultados de este estudio sugieren que los programas motores utilizados para la evitación de obstáculos son susceptibles de estar preparados en estructuras subcorticales. Es posible que la liberación de estos programas motores, debido al estímulo auditivo de alta intensidad, combine la facilitación intersensorial y el efecto StartReact. La principal aportación de la presente tesis es el hecho de que las actividades humanas voluntarias pueden ser provocadas a través de la estimulación subcortical. Las estructuras subcorticales están altamente implicadas en la programación previa y en la ejecución de movimientos complejos voluntarios...|$|R
