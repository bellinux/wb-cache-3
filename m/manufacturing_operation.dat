40|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{studies have been done}} on entrepreneurial orientation (EO), its relationship with <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> has yet to be determined. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} is to identify the relationship between EO and the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> of Malaysian rural entrepreneurs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The survey questionnaires were distributed to 73 respondents who were rural entrepreneurs in Selangor, Malaysia. Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis was used to analyze the quantitative data obtained. The findings showed that the five dimensions of EO (innovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking, competitive aggressiveness and autonomy) has positive relationship with <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations.</b> Competitive aggressiveness has the highest value of correlation with <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> among the EO dimensions. It can be concluded that the EO has strong relationship with <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> of Malaysian SMEs rural entrepreneurs. This study provides new empirical evidence on EO and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> relationship as well as some practical contributions to the rural SMEs entrepreneurs in Malaysia. Several recommendations have been proposed for further investigations in future studies...|$|R

40|$|In {{the modern}} {{manufacturing}} environment, alternative sets of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> can normally be generated for machining one feature of a part. Each set of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> {{results in a}} specific manufacturing cost {{in terms of the}} allocated tolerances, and requires a specific set of manufacturing resources, such as machines, fixtures/jigs and cutting tools. In this paper, the problems of allocating tolerances to the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> and selecting exactly one representative from the alternative sets of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> for machining one feature of the part are formulated. The purpose is to minimize, for all the features to be machined, the sum of the costs of the selected sets of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> and the dissimilarities in their manufacturing resource requirements. The techniques of the genetic algorithm and the Hopfield neural network are adopted as possible approaches to solve these problems. The genetic algorithm is utilized to generate the optimal tolerance for each of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations,</b> and the Hopfield neural network is adopted to solve the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> selection problem. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches. Indeed, the proposed approaches show the potential of working towards the optimal solutions to the tolerance allocation problem and the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> selection problem in process planning. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The {{international}} standard IEC 62264, {{also known as}} ISA 95, deals with Enterprise-Control System integration and <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Operations</b> Management. The standard contains, among other things, a description of what <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Operations</b> means. The description states that The activities of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> management are those activities of a manufacturing facility that coordinate the personnel, equipment, material, and energy in the conversion of raw materials and/or parts into products. <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> management includes activities that may be performed by physical equipment, human effort, and information systems. A model for the activities involved in <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Operations</b> {{is presented in the}} standard. As global competition in manufacturing has increased, trends within industry have been to increase the level and amount of control and automation. This means that the activities involved in the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operations</b> management needs to be well synchronized, coordinated and integrated with each other. This can be assured via different means, for example by the usage of a graphical language. The graphical language lets the user specify what activities that should be performed and in what order etc. Even though the standard presents a model for the activities involved in <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Operations</b> it does not speak about how the synchronization and coordination between the activities should be done. This paper will describe why a graphical language would be suitable for this task, what requirements the graphical language should fulfill in order to be successful, and what advantages this could bring to its use...|$|R

The Schweizers received the suggestion positively as they needed more space to produce gliders, but they had no money with which to make the move.|$|E

25|$|Carrick's local {{infrastructure}} (in particular {{health and}} transport) still remains relatively undeveloped, {{due to its}} location {{on the border of}} 3 counties (and subsequent lack of political muscle both at county and national level), and the nearby larger towns of Clonmel and Waterford.

The population continues to increase, and the town expands with ongoing significant house building projects.

A month before Allied troops landed in France, it was turning out enough critically needed 100-octane aviation gasoline to fuel 1,000 daily bomber sorties from England to Germany. Government funding through the Defense Plant Corporation (DPC) also prompted Cities Service to build plants to manufacture butadiene, used to make synthetic rubber, and toluene, a fuel octane booster and solvent.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the ongoing}} {{tensions}} between Chrysler and Mitsubishi, {{they agreed to}} unite in a vehicle <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operation</b> in Normal, Illinois.

Diamond-Star Motors (DSM)—from the parent companies' logos: three diamonds (Mitsubishi) and a pentastar (Chrysler)—was incorporated in October 1985, and in April 1986 ground was broken on a 1.9million square-foot (177,000m²) production facility. In 1987, the company was selling 67,000 cars a year in the U.S., but when the plant was completed in March 1988 it offered an annual capacity of 240,000 vehicles. Initially, three platform-sharing compact 2+2 coupés were released, the Mitsubishi Eclipse, Eagle Talon and Plymouth Laser, with other models being introduced in subsequent years.|$|E

25|$|In 1869, {{after working}} for {{drugstore}}s in Greencastle and Indianapolis, Indiana, Lilly became {{a partner in}} a Paris, Illinois, drugstore with James W. Binford. Although the drugstore was profitable, Lilly was more interested in medicinal manufacturing than running a pharmacy. He began formulating plans to create a company of his own. Lilly left the partnership with Binford in 1873 and returned to Indianapolis. Lilly opened a drug <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operation</b> called Johnston and Lilly with John F. Johnston as his partner in 1874, but dissolved the failing partnership on March 27, 1876. Lilly used his share of the assets, which amounted to an estimated $400 in merchandise (several pieces of equipment and a few gallons of unmixed chemicals) and about $1,000 in cash, to open his own pharmaceutical manufacturing business in Indianapolis in May 1876. His new business venture became Eli Lilly and Company.|$|E
25|$|At American Apparel, Charney was {{involved}} in nearly {{every part of the}} business process from design and manufacturing to marketing. At a time when the US garment industry had largely shifted to outsourced overseas manufacturing, Charney built American Apparel into a vertically-integrated fashion company—the largest clothing <b>manufacturing</b> <b>operation</b> in the United States—where every aspect of the business, from design and manufacturing to distribution and marketing, was done from American Apparel’s headquarters in Los Angeles. Charney was also responsible for American Apparel to be an early adopter of RFID tags on garments in 2007 in an effort to reduce theft and improve inventory control. In addition, Charney pioneered the Made in USA sweatshop-free model of transparency, fair wages and a refusal to outsource manufacturing. He is also a vocal advocate for immigration reform in the United States through the Legalize LA campaign, which was championed by American Apparel.
