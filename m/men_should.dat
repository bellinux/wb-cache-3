5|$|Believing that <b>men</b> <b>should</b> not {{be given}} {{the right to vote}} without women also being granted the franchise, Sojourner Truth, a former slave and feminist, {{affiliated}} herself with Stanton and Anthony's organization. Stanton, Anthony, and Truth were joined by Matilda Joslyn Gage, who later worked on The Woman's Bible with Stanton. Despite Stanton's position and the efforts of her and others to expand the Fifteenth Amendment to include voting rights for all women, this amendment also passed, as it was originally written, in 1870.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of the {{clitoris}} {{is significantly}} impacted by cultural {{perceptions of the}} organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that <b>men</b> <b>should</b> be expected to master and control women's orgasms.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{evidence}} submitted by the prosecution {{took the form of}} depositions made by leading Nazis. The defence demanded that the <b>men</b> <b>should</b> be brought to Israel so that the defence's right to cross-examination would not be abrogated. But Hausner, in his role as Attorney General, declared that he would be obliged to have any war criminals who entered Israel arrested. The prosecution proved that Eichmann had visited places where exterminations had taken place, including Chełmno extermination camp, Auschwitz, and Minsk (where he witnessed a mass shooting of Jews), and therefore was aware that the deportees were being killed.|$|E

50|$|The preface of US Guys {{includes}} {{this quote}} on LeDuff's {{view of the}} American male: ::The American man has been taught that while {{it is better to}} avoid a fight, he should have been in a fight; that honor cannot always be defended with reason. He should never admit fear. He should always strive to put the blade in his adversary’s chest, not his back. An American <b>man</b> <b>should</b> know how to load and fire a gun. He should know how to ride a horse, bet on a horse, bet on the stock market, and bet on the cards. A good <b>man</b> <b>should</b> know a woman’s body and know how to please her. His woman, in turn, should never speak anything but well of him in public. An American <b>man</b> <b>should</b> have been raised in the church, rejected the church and eventually found virtue in the church.::The American <b>man</b> <b>should</b> be educated. He should work. He should honor his debts and live within his means. He should be able to recite poetry and have bits of true philosophy at his fingertips. He should be able to play an instrument and know how to help a rose grow. An American <b>man</b> <b>should</b> know how to dress and speak his language well. He should be handy and mechanically inclined and yet his nails must be clean. A <b>man</b> <b>should</b> have children, and at some point his children should reject him. And {{in the course of his}} life, a man’s children should return and find virtue in him.::This is what an American <b>man</b> <b>should</b> be. Of course, no such man has ever existed, and no man probably ever will.|$|R

5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{has also}} been criticized within Islamic circles and the major {{opposition}} in the Indian subcontinent comes from the Barelvi movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on da'wa tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that <b>men</b> <b>should</b> facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the first British {{airborne}} raid, Operation Colossus, prompted the War Office to expand the airborne force {{through the creation of}} the Parachute Regiment, and to develop plans to convert several infantry battalions into parachute and glider battalions. On 31 May 1941, a joint Army and RAF memorandum was approved by the Chiefs-of-Staff and Winston Churchill; it recommended that the British airborne forces should consist of two parachute brigades, one based in England and the other in the Middle East, and that a glider force of 10,000 <b>men</b> <b>should</b> be created.|$|E
5|$|A {{foundation}} {{member of}} the Toorak College council in 1927, Mary served as its president from 1947 to 1948 and again from 1960 to 1970. She played tennis and golf, and when her two eldest daughters began playing hockey at school, Mary's interest in hockey was rekindled. A strong believer in the principle that women and not <b>men</b> <b>should</b> administer women's sports, she became a {{member of the}} Victorian Women's Amateur Sports Council, and was later the patron of the Victorian Women's Hockey Association. Players visiting from interstate would often stay at her home. This was extended to overseas visitors during the 1956 Summer Olympics, which were held in Melbourne.|$|E

5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall when talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that <b>men</b> <b>should</b> always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Endecott was a zealous and {{somewhat}} hotheaded Puritan, with Separatist {{attitudes toward the}} Anglican Church. This sometimes put him at odds with Nonconformist views that were dominant among the colony's early leaders, which became apparent when he gave shelter to the vocally Separatist Roger Williams. Endecott also argued that women should dress modestly and that <b>men</b> <b>should</b> keep their hair short, and issued judicial decisions banishing individuals who held religious views that did not accord well {{with those of the}} Puritans. He notoriously defaced the English flag because he saw St George's Cross {{as a symbol of the}} papacy, and had four Quakers put to death for returning to the colony after their banishment. An expedition he led in 1636 is considered the opening offensive in the Pequot War, which practically destroyed the Pequot tribe as an entity.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Duncan Wood, the BBC's Head of Comedy, {{watched a}} comedy on {{television}} called The Misfit. Impressed by writer Roy Clarke's ability to inject both comedy and drama into the sitcom, Wood offered Clarke {{the opportunity to}} write a sitcom. Clarke nearly turned the job down as {{he felt that the}} BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the <b>men</b> <b>should</b> all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free to roam around like adolescents in the prime of their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.|$|E

5|$|On {{arrival at}} Falmouth, England, after a {{crossing}} under filthy conditions, Allen {{and the other}} prisoners were imprisoned in Pendennis Castle, Cornwall. At first his treatment was poor, but Allen wrote a letter, ostensibly to the Continental Congress, describing his conditions and suggesting that Congress treat the prisoners it held the same way. Unknown to Allen, British prisoners now included General Prescott, captured trying to escape from Montreal, and the letter came {{into the hands of}} the British cabinet. Also faced with opposition within the British establishment to the treatment of captives taken in North America, King George decreed that the <b>men</b> <b>should</b> be sent back to America and treated as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Written {{during the}} Japanese {{occupation}} of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), while Pane was {{an employee of the}} Cultural Centre in Jakarta, Kami, Perempuan is similar to contemporary plays owing to its openly pro-Japanese message and emphasis on everyday issues experienced by average people. Discussions of the play have found it to be pro-Japanese propaganda, suggesting that <b>men</b> <b>should</b> join the military to please their women, though it has also been suggested that the play is in fact a warning against accepting the Defenders of the Homeland as being for Indonesia. Kami, Perempuan was performed numerous times in 1943, and its script has been compiled in a book.|$|E
5|$|Murdoch {{had been}} {{concerned}} lest {{he and his}} <b>men</b> <b>should</b> be engaged {{when they reached the}} Kapyong River in an exhausted condition and with little ammunition. Luck was with the Australians, and due to difficulties of communication and navigation along the ridge line in the dark, elements of A Company had become separated and the last two platoons descended to the river too early to strike the ford. However, reaching a deserted part of the bank they realised their mistake and immediately turned west again, following the river-bank to the ford. The Chinese did not follow this sudden final turn and plunged on into the river, giving A Company an unexpected opportunity to break free. The Chinese were subsequently detected by the Canadians on Hill 677 and were fired on. Fortunately for the Australians, the Canadian fire did not hit them. This possibility had been foreseen earlier; however, problems with the radio relay between the Canadians and Australians meant that there had been no guarantee that the withdrawing force would not be mistaken for Chinese as they crossed the river.|$|E

5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave <b>men</b> <b>should,</b> and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young <b>men</b> <b>should</b> not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
