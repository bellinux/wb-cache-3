50|$|Japan and Australia are {{the largest}} {{producers}} of cultured pearls. The process takes place within the tissues of living oysters, the species Pinctada fucata and Pteria penguin being mainly {{used for this purpose}} in Japan and Pinctada maxima in Australia. The oyster spat is grown in mesh baskets immersed in the sea {{for two or three years}} until large enough to seed. Then a tiny <b>mother-of-pearl</b> <b>bead</b> is inserted into the shell and layers of nacre become deposited around this. The oysters are kept in wire nets suspended from rafts while both oysters and pearls grow. Readiness for harvest is often determined by x-ray. Not only is the pearl gathered, but the nacre lining the inside of the valves of the shell is used in jewellery and in the manufacture of ornamental objects.|$|E
50|$|With {{the growing}} colonial thrust {{a new market}} {{appeared}} notably in Africa for fancy beads. The models made included faceted <b>beads,</b> <b>mother-of-pearl</b> <b>beads</b> and chevron beads. They were also used for trading with Native Americans {{in the second half}} of the 19th century, as well as for the fashion conscious ladies of the time.|$|R
40|$|Folding fan of {{bone and}} satin. Guards and sticks of bone, {{intricately}} carved with pierced latticework. Plain off-white silk satin leaf. Chased metal bail ring at pivot with <b>mother-of-pearl</b> <b>beads.</b> Off-white silk tassel tied to bail. Inscribed on silk leaf along one guard: "Hood W. [illeg. ] / June 5 th / 73 "; other inscriptions on other guard, too fragile to examine...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The first canoe {{that came}} had five men on board. Girdles of beautifully plaited cocoa-nut fibre round their waists were their only clothing, but some had wreaths {{of flowers and}} green leaves round their heads, {{and most of them}} wore <b>mother-of-pearl</b> shells, <b>beads,</b> &c., round their necks and in their ears. They do not tattoo, but brand their skins. All five came, and {{presently}} three more, and then another; but seeing a large double canoe with perhaps twenty men in her coming close, we stood away. Two of our visitors chose to stay, and we have them on board now: Alsoff, a man of perhaps forty-five, and Mospa, a very intelligent young man from whom I am picking up words as fast as I can. F. would have laughed to have seen me rigging them out in calico shirts, buttoning them up. Mospa gave me his wooden comb, which they push through their hair, as you ladies do coral or gold pins at parties. Another fellow whose head was elaborately frizzled and plastered with coral lime, departed with one of my common calico pocket-handkerchiefs with my name in Joan's marking. This is to adorn his head, and for aught I know, is the first, and certainly the best specimen of handwriting in the island. We hope to call at all these islands on our way back from the north, but at present we only dodge a few canoes, &c.|$|R
