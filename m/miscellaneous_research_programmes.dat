5000|$|Lakatos {{found that}} many <b>research</b> <b>programmes</b> coexisted. Each had a hard core of {{theories}} immune to revision, surrounded by a protective belt of malleable theories. [...] A <b>research</b> <b>programme</b> vies against others to be most progressive. [...] Extending the <b>research</b> <b>programme's</b> theories into new domains is theoretical progress, and experimentally corroborating such is empirical progress, always refusing falsification of the <b>research</b> <b>programme's</b> hard core. [...] A <b>research</b> <b>programme</b> might degenerate—lose progressiveness—but later return to progressiveness.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{formally}} {{describes the}} Human Capital Theory as a <b>Research</b> <b>Programme</b> that {{fits into the}} classical economic <b>Research</b> <b>Programmes.</b> The fundamental ¿hard core¿ assumption which converts the Human Capital Theory into a <b>Research</b> <b>Programme</b> itself in Lakatosian terms {{is based upon the}} embodiment of the human capital in the person investing in it. The paper shows how the auxiliary ¿protective belt¿ assumptions and the empirical content of the theory are linked to and derived from the ¿hard core¿ assumptions {{in such a way that}} the Human Capital Theory satisfies the conditions to be considered a Scientific <b>Research</b> <b>Programme.</b> Lakatos, <b>Research</b> <b>Programme,</b> Human Capital. ...|$|R
