40|$|We {{conducted}} an economic {{analysis of a}} store-and-forward teledermatology system for the routine triage of skin cancer patients. A cost-identification, cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analysis under a societal perspective {{was used to compare}} teledermatology with the conventional care alternative. In the period March 2004 to July 2005, a total of 2009 teledermatology referrals were managed from 12 Primary Care Centres (PCCs) of the public health system. The unit cost was of E 79. 78 per patient in teledermatology, and E 129. 37 per patient in conventional care (P, 0. 005), with an incremental cost of E 49. 59 per patient in favour of teledermatology. The cost ratio between teledermatology and conventional care was 1. 6. There was a significant inverse relation between the unit cost in each participating PCC and the number of teleconsultations transmitted from them (P, 0. 001). Teledermatology resulted in a more cost-effective, or dominant, methodology. In a public health system equipped with an intranet, the routine use of teledermatology in skin cancer clinics is a cost-effective method of <b>managing</b> <b>referrals...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{waiting list}} for {{outpatient}} Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) appointments exceeded 12 months. This paper discusses {{the development and implementation}} of a bespoke mental health assessment process that improved the timeliness of assessments for referred children and adolescents. Aim: To introduce a new system of <b>managing</b> <b>referrals</b> to reduce the {{waiting list for}} children and their families. Methods: Action research methodology was used as an approach to engage practitioners and facilitate change within a multidisciplinary CAMHS in the UK. The methods used to generate data about the intervention were semi structured interviews with families referred to the services and with practitioners working in the team, as well as an examination of waiting list data and a survey of referrers to the service. Findings: As a result of the implementation of a triage approach, the waiting time for a referred child to receive an initial CAMHS assessment was reduced from 12 months to all children being assessed within one month of referral. Referrers to the service and families involved valued the quick response from CAMHS. Conclusions: This was a bespoke process that combined a brief clinical interview, the use of psychometric measures and a team review meeting to create an effective mechanism for conducting brief, robust mental health assessments. Implications for practice: It was possible to glean sufficient detail about the nature of a child’s mental health difficulties from a brief assessment or triage process A brief assessment process might be useful in a number of mental health fields to enable screening, triage or a gateway assessment to be conducted Action research was a useful approach to engage practitioners as collaborating partners during organisational change in a way that promoted sustainability for that chang...|$|E

Of the remaining 41, 17 were appealed successfully and three unsuccessfullly. More than half of the elective extracontractual referrals correctly submitted were to either orthopaedics, general surgery, oral surgery, gynaecology, or plastic surgery.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{regulated}} financial services has been ill-served by marketing theory. As a consequence: (1) {{the nature of}} marketing in this sector has been misunderstood; (2) the key mechanism for generating new business in the field, namely, referrals, {{has been the subject}} of serious misapprehension; and, (3) the guidance offered to practitioners has been negligible. In particular, the role of the independent financial advisor (IFA) appears to have been conceptualised as a sales role, and the nature of the relationship between the IFA and the client has been addressed as though it were a straightforward buyer-seller relationship, with the IFA selling products to the client. It is unlikely that these conceptualisations were ever satisfactory and following recent regulatory changes in the sector they have become even less relevant. Since January 1 st 2013 commission-based selling of financial investment products to consumers has been prohibited so that independent financial advice has become largely a fee-based service. The focus of this research is on referrals as a method of generating new business; the research context is the UK independent financial advice industry. The objectives of the study are to: (1) define and conceptualise referrals in the context of the financial advice industry; (2) develop a framework of the referral process; (3) provide practitioners with empirical evidence in connection with their embedded beliefs about referrals in this industry; (4) explore whether (as many practitioner believe) it is possible to actively <b>manage</b> <b>referral</b> generation within a financial advice business; and, (5) to investigate the importance of referrals as a means of generating new business for advisors. It was found that practitioners believe they influence referrals in four main ways: excellent service, higher qualifications, contact frequency and speed of response. However the results of this study clearly indicate that referrals are not the outcome of agency; they are a random occurrence, determined by happenstance and the result of an opportunist conversation between a prospect and a client. In turn, contrary to the advice of consultancy providers, asking for referrals was found to be ineffective and not welcomed by consumers. While word-of-mouth (WOM) often instigates referral generation, the value of WOM, needs be treated with caution, since consumers were found to have limited understanding of the service provided by independent advisors. Despite the importance consumers attribute to investment performance practitioners do not, commonly, provide investment benchmarks nor do consumers use analytical tools to assess the performance of their advisor. The absence of performance measures connects with the finding that practitioners have difficulty in describing what they do hence consumers are uncertain how to describe the service and what to say about it when asked...|$|R

These pilots include a prospective one-year cohort study of all patients who enrolled in April 2003 and a case-control study in 2004 of enrollees and nonenrollees at two hospital-based primary care practices. Measurements: The cohort study tracked patient enrollment and features in PatientSite that enrollees accessed, such as laboratory and radiology results, prescription renewals, appointment requests, <b>managed</b> care <b>referrals,</b> and clinical messaging. The case-control study used medical record review to compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of 100 randomly selected PatientSite enrollees and 100 nonenrollees. Results: PatientSite use grew steadily after its introduction. New enrollees logged in most frequently in the first month, but 26 % to 77 % of the cohort continued to access the portal at least monthly. They most often examined laboratory and radiology results and sent clinical messages to their providers. PatientSite enrollees were younger and more affluent and had fewer medical problems than nonenrollees.

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} why {{health workers}} fail to follow integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) guidelines for severely ill children at first-level outpatient health facilities {{in rural areas}} of the United Republic of Tanzania. Methods Retrospective and prospective case reviews of severely ill children aged < 5 years were conducted at health facilities in four districts. We ascertained treatment and examined the characteristics associated with referral, conducted follow-up interviews with parents of severely ill children, and gave health workers questionnaires and interviews. Findings In total, 502 cases were reviewed at 62 facilities. Treatment with antimalarials and antibiotics {{was consistent with the}} diagnosis given by health workers. However, of 240 children classified as having “very severe febrile disease”, none received all IMCI-recommended therapies, and only 25 % of severely ill children were referred. Lethargy and anaemia diagnoses were independently associated with referral. Most (91 %) health workers indicated that certain severe conditions can be <b>managed</b> without <b>referral.</b> Conclusion The health workers surveyed rarely adhered to IMCI treatment and referral guidelines for children with severe illness. They administered therapy based on narrow diagnoses rather than IMCI classifications, disagreed with referral guidelines and often considered referral unnecessary. To improve implementation of IMCI, attention should focus on the reasons for health worker non-adherence. Une traduction en français de ce résumé figure à la fin de l’article.

40|$|Despite recent {{reductions}} in prevalence, China still faces a substantial tuberculosis (TB) burden, with future progress {{dependent on the}} ability of rural providers to appropriately detect and refer TB patients for further care. This study (a) provides a baseline assessment of the ability of rural providers to correctly manage presumptive TB cases; (b) measures the gap between provider knowledge and practice and; (c) evaluates how ongoing reforms of China's health system-characterized by a movement toward "integrated care" and promotion of initial contact with grassroots providers-will affect the care of TB patients. Unannounced standardized patients (SPs) presenting with classic pulmonary TB symptoms were deployed in 3 provinces of China in July 2015. The SPs successfully completed 274 interactions across all 3 tiers of China's rural health system, interacting with providers in 46 village clinics, 207 township health centers, and 21 county hospitals. Interactions between providers and standardized patients were assessed against international and national standards of TB care. Using a lenient definition of correct management as at least a referral, chest X-ray or sputum test, 41 % (111 of 274) SPs were correctly managed. Although there were no cases of empirical anti-TB treatment, antibiotics unrelated to the treatment of TB were prescribed in 168 of 274 interactions or 61. 3 % (95 % CI: 55 %- 67 %). Correct management proportions significantly higher at county hospitals compared to township health centers (OR 0. 06, 95 % CI: 0. 01 - 0. 25, p < 0. 001) and village clinics (OR 0. 02, 95 % CI: 0. 0 - 0. 17, p < 0. 001). Correct management in tests of knowledge administered to the same 274 physicians for the same case was 45 percentage points (95 % CI: 37 %- 53 %) higher with 24 percentage points (95 % CI: - 33 % to - 15 %) fewer antibiotic prescriptions. Relative to the current system, where patients can choose to bypass any level of care, simulations suggest that a system of <b>managed</b> <b>referral</b> with gatekeeping at the level of village clinics would reduce proportions of correct management from 41 % to 16 %, while gatekeeping {{at the level of the}} township hospital would retain correct management close to current levels at 37 %. The main limitations of the study are 2 -fold. First, we evaluate the management of a one-time new patient presenting with presumptive TB, which may not reflect how providers manage repeat patients or more complicated TB presentations. Second, simulations under alternate policies require behavioral and statistical assumptions that should be addressed in future applications of this method. There were significant quality deficits among village clinics and township health centers in the management of a classic case of presumptive TB, with higher proportions of correct case management in county hospitals. Poor clinical performance does not arise only from a lack of knowledge, a phenomenon known as the "know-do" gap. Given significant deficits in quality of care, reforms encouraging first contact with lower tiers of the health system can improve efficiency only with concomitant improvements in appropriate management of presumptive TB patients in village clinics and township health centers...|$|R

The best mode of treatment for undescended testes is con-troversial, and local traditions often override knowledge gained from randomized controlled studies.

The optimal time for orchiopexy has also been debated. However, a recent randomized controlled study shows that surgery at 9 months of age is followed by a better post-operative growth of the testes than surgery at 3 years, which supports previous arguments for early surgery.

40|$|Purpose: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} if inclusion of a care coordination system to <b>manage</b> the <b>referral</b> process for hematuria would lead to improved quality of care. Materials And Methods: A protocol-based, electronic medical record (EMR) -enabled care coordination system ("The Inflection Navigator") was developed to support primary care physicians evaluating newly discovered hematuria. This system was studied for patients referred for microscopic and gross hematuria from May 2009 to May 2010. The outcomes for these "navigated" patients (Inflection Navigator, n= 106) were compared to patients referred to our urology department for hematuria {{during the same time}} period who did not use the Inflection Navigator system (Standard Referral, n= 105). Results: Patients in the Inflection Navigator group completed their evaluation in significantly shorter time, with an over one month difference in time between referral and completing both the imaging and cystoscopy components of the workup (mean 40. 9 vs. 74. 1 days, p< 0. 05). Additionally, use of this system potentially lowered healthcare costs by decreasing the mean urology visits to complete an evaluation, from 2. 1 in the Standard Referral group (SD 1. 5) to 1. 6 in the Inflection Navigator group (SD 1. 4) (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: A protocol-based care coordination system for hematuria decreased the time to complete an evaluation and decreased the number of overall visits required to reach a final diagnosis. The Inflection Navigator system is thus an example of an EMR-enabled process innovation which can improve the efficiency of care while potentially lowering healthcare costs...|$|R

Objective: To establish the level of agreement between a physiotherapist and an orthopaedic surgeon regarding diagnosis, management and corticosteroid injection, in {{a representative sample of}} orthopaedic shoulder referrals. Design: Blinded inter-rater agreement study. Method: 274 public orthopaedic shoulder patients were independently assessed by a physiotherapist and an orthopaedic surgeon. Management, subacromial corticosteroid injection, diagnosis and investigation decisions were compared using inter-rater reliability statistics. Results: Agreement between the physiotherapist and the orthopaedic surgeon was near perfect for surgical versus nonsurgical management (Gwets agreement coefficient AC 1 =. 93, 95 %CI:. 90 -. 93), safety of injection (AC 1 =. 85, CI:. 79 -. 91) and investigations requested (AC 1 =. 87, CI:. 83 -. 91); substantial for the presence of subacromial pain (AC 1 =. 74, CI:. 66 -. 81) and diagnosis (AC 1 =. 72, CI:. 66 -. 78); and moderate regarding delivery of subacromial corticosteroid injection as an immediate treatment (AC 1 =. 48, CI. 33 -. 53), with the physiotherapist less inclined to select corticosteroid injection as the first intervention. Conclusion: In this study a physiotherapist with prescribing and injection training made decisions analogous to those of an orthopaedic surgeon at initial consultation for orthopaedic shoulder pain, including the safe identification of patients for subacromial injection, without the need for prior screening of referrals by orthopaedic doctors...|$|R
