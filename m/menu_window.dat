5000|$|In Windows 8.x, Metro-style apps do not {{run in a}} window. Instead, {{they either}} occupy the entire screen or are snapped to one side, in which case they occupy the entire height of the screen but only part of its width. They have no title bar, system <b>menu,</b> <b>window</b> borders or control buttons. Command {{interfaces}} like scroll bars are usually hidden at first. Menus {{are located in the}} [...] "settings charm". Metro-style apps use the UI controls of Windows 8.x and typically follow Windows 8.x UI guidelines, such as horizontal scrolling and the inclusion of edge-UIs, like the app bar.|$|E
30|$|The {{preliminary}} {{raw data}} (viewed by the lecturer or administrator) in flowchart.com was {{consisted of a}} lengthy sequence of actions labeled as: {ActionType, Construct, Subject, TimeStamp}, where (1) ActionType can be: a Create (i.e., build/create a Rectangle, Simple Line or a Text Object), a Delete (i.e., remove/delete a Rectangle, Simple Line or a Text Object), a Move (i.e., move/shift a Rectangle, Simple Line or a Text Object), an Edit (i.e., add/edit a Text Object in a component or an arrow), a Scroll (i.e., scroll up or {{down the list of}} suggested components through the <b>menu</b> <b>window),</b> an Open (i.e., start the <b>menu</b> <b>window</b> in flowchart.com), or a Close (i.e., finish the <b>menu</b> <b>window</b> in flowchart.com). (2) Construct can be: a Rectangle (component), a Simple Line (arrow), a Text Object or a <b>Menu</b> (<b>window).</b> (3) Subject is the student who executes the action (such as Me, Mike, Jack, Kate, etc.) (4) TimeStamp is the time when the action takes place (such as 10 : 12 : 07 or 23 : 14 : 15) (Martinez-Maldonado 2014; Martinez-Maldonado et al. 2013 b).|$|E

40|$|We havedeveloped a mouse-selected menu {{system based}} on NCSA Mosaic {{which is one of}} the most famous clients of World Wide Web (WWW) server. Mosaic was modi ed to be able to forkprograms locally by {{clicking}} mouse button. We use the modi ed Mosaic as menu system for researchers in biological eld who are unfamiliar with computer operation. When a user logs in our workstation, the menu system is automatically executed and the <b>menu</b> <b>window</b> appears on the display screen of the workstation. The information displayed in the <b>menu</b> <b>window</b> includes hyper phrase of 'program execution' in addition to usual hyper text information of Mosaic/WWW. Clicking 'program execution', the next <b>menu</b> <b>window</b> including hyper phrases of programs appears. By clicking one of the hyper phrases of programs, the corresponding program begins to run. The programs forked through the menu system are shown in the below. Asterisks indicate the programs developed by us which are explained later. 1. ghom 3 : Homology search {{system based on}} client-server model. 2. gnome: A sequence data management tool to access e-mail servers for molecular biological analysis[1]. 3. editalign: Multiple sequence alignment and editor[2]...|$|E
30|$|One {{example of}} the lecturer/administrator‘s view in flowchart.com {{includes}}: {“Create”, “Simple Line”, “Mike”, “ 18 : 02 : 00 ”}, when Mike creates (or adds) a Simple Line (or an arrow) at 18 : 02 : 00 o’clock. Another example includes {“Move”, “Rectangle 2 ”, “Jennifer”, “ 18 : 04 : 12 ”}, when Jennifer moves (or shifts) the second Rectangle (or Component) at 18 : 04 : 12 o’clock. Similarly, the sequence {“Open”, “Menu”, “Ted”, “ 15 : 16 : 02 ”} is shown when Ted opens the <b>menu</b> <b>window</b> at 15 : 16 : 02 o’clock (Martinez-Maldonado 2014; Martinez-Maldonado et al. 2013 b).|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a computer software package for Macintosh to simulate the metabolism and hemoglobin binding affinity of human red blood cell. The model is capable of simulating hemoglobin binding of ligands, metabolite concentrations, and metabolic fluxes at physiological steady state {{and in response to}} extracellular parameter variations, such as pH, osmolarity, glucose, and adenine concentrations. The kinetic parameters of enzymes, extracellular conditions, and initial intracellular metabolite concentrations can be specified by the user in order to model a particular situation. The software is use friendly, utilizing <b>menu,</b> <b>window,</b> and mouse to interact with the user. It also provides a pathway map of the red cell, which allows a direct access to enzyme kinetics by clicking the enzymes in the map...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the changes to the Start <b>menu,</b> <b>Windows</b> 8 takes a more modal approach with its use of full-screen apps that steer away from reliance on the icon-based desktop interface. In doing so, however, Microsoft has shifted its focus away from multitasking and business productivity.|$|R
50|$|The first Java GUI toolkit was the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), {{introduced}} with Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.0 as {{one component}} of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.

30|$|In {{order to}} further analyze the students’ actions {{with respect to}} the level of {{influence}} or impact on the concept mapping assignment, and in order to follow a similar approach developed by Martinez-Maldonado (2014) and Martinez-Maldonado et al. (2013 b); we decided to categorize the actions as follows: (1) high-impact actions (i.e., refers to those types of actions that can substantially change the content or structure of the online concept map, such as: Add a component or arrow, Delete a component or arrow, Edit text a component or arrow), (2) low-impact actions (i.e., refers to those types of actions that only can change the layout or formation of the concept map, such as: Shift a component or arrow), and (3) no-impact actions (i.e., refers to those types of actions that have no influence on the contents or formation of the concept map, such as: opening and closing the main <b>menu</b> <b>window,</b> or scrolling up and down through the main menu in flowchart.com environment).|$|E
40|$|A generic {{expert system}} is {{described}} for inspecting materials processed in space (MPS). The {{system may be}} applied, with the appropriate knowledge base, {{to any of the}} nondestructive testing methods (NDT) which are appropriate to MPS. Regardless of the method being used, the inspection process consists of three tasks: (1) signal or image processing of the NDT output and feature extraction, (2) interpretation of features in terms of MPS discontinuities, and (3) evaluation {{of the quality of the}} MPS based upon industry standards. In contrast to rule based systems, this system represents its knowledge as multidimensional vectors and appropriate functions on them. Currently, the expert system accepts manual input of observed features. Once the expert system has been tested and compared to human expert inspectors, a vision front-end will be developed to complete automation of the expert MPS inspection system, based on visual discontuities. Then the data base will be extended to include a variety of other NDT methods. In addition to functional performance, ease of use was established through <b>menu</b> <b>window</b> driven input as well as flexibility in building, using and modifying data bases for different applications...|$|E
30|$|In addition, the Low Performance {{groups in}} average {{executed}} more blocks of actions with no-impact such as opening or shifting the main <b>menu</b> <b>window</b> in flowchart.com free online concept making environment (see Fig.  8). The average frequencies of the “NoImpact-Possess” and “NoImpact-NoPossess” blocks were 4.6 in High Performance groups (i.e., 46 divided by 20 is equal with 2.3) versus 3 in Low Performance groups (i.e., 30 divided by 10 is equal with 3). Therefore, the average frequencies of the “NoImpact-Possess” and “NoImpact-NoPossess” blocks were 1.3 times {{more in the}} Low Performance groups compared with the High Performance groups. This was not compatible {{with the findings of}} Martinez-Maldonado (2014) and Martinez-Maldonado et al. (2013 b) as in their works the blocks “NoImpact-NoOwner” and “NoImpact-Owner” only appeared in the resulting fuzzy model of the high achieving groups, while the resulting fuzzy model of the low achieving groups did not contain the blocks of “NoImpact-NoOwner” and “NoImpact-Owner”. However, we need to consider an important issue that in the studies conducted by Martinez-Maldonado (2014) and Martinez-Maldonado et al. (2013 b); a “High Only” block was defined and introduced as a mixture of both high impact actions and no impact actions; and a “LowOnly” block was defined and introduced as a mixture of both low impact actions and no impact actions; and a “NoImpact” block was defined and introduced as a block which only includes no impact actions.|$|E
