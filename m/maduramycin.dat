40|$|International audienceMaduramycin is a {{polyether}} ionophoric coccidiostat used {{to prevent}} coccidiosis in poultry at a prescribed concentration during a certain time interval. Due to a public health concern {{about the presence of}} coccidiostat residues in poultry, the aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the level of <b>maduramycin</b> residues in the tissues of broiler chickens fed commercially-produced feed containing 5 mg. kg- 1 of <b>maduramycin</b> in complete feed throughout the 5 days of the withdrawal period (WP). The residues were investigated by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with electrospray ionisation (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with triple quadrupole. The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method were 0. 3 μg. kg- 1 and 0. 8 μg. kg- 1, respectively. The average recovery based on the matrix-fortified calibrations for chicken tissues was 90 %. <b>Maduramycin</b> was found to be rapidly distributed in all tissues. The highest concentrations of <b>maduramycin</b> residues were found in the heart followed by the skin, liver, gizzard, kidneys, and finally, the muscle (thigh and breast). On day 5 of the WP, the residue concentrations of <b>maduramycin</b> did not decline below the LOQ of the method. Our results emphasize the need to establish the maximum residue limit (MRL) for <b>maduramycin</b> to control the levels of its residues in edible tissues from chickens before slaughter...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMaduramycin is a {{coccidiostat}} authorized as a {{feed additive}} in poultry. The Council Directive 96 / 23 /EC stipulates that monitoring of foods {{of animal origin}} for residues of coccidiostats is mandatory. The aim of our study was to evaluate the STAR for the screening of <b>maduramycin</b> residues in the tissues of broiler chickens and pheasants. Both animal species were supplied feed medicated with Cygro l % premix according to recommendations for use (5 mg. kg- 1 of complete feed). The residues were investigated {{for a period of}} seven days: day 0 (the last day of the administration of <b>maduramycin),</b> days 1 - 5 (the days of the withdrawal period /WP/) and day 6 (the first day after elapse of the WP). According to the STAR the positivity of the sample (presence of residues of antibacterial substances) is indicated by a zone of inhibition exceeding 2 or 4 mm in width in dependence on the test organism. <b>Maduramycin</b> residues were detected only on the plates seeded with the test organism Bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis ATCC 10149. Our results showed that there was higher potential for the presence of <b>maduramycin</b> residues in broiler chickens than in pheasants. All examined chicken tissues (muscle /thigh and breast/, gizzard, liver, heart, kidneys, spleen, lungs) were positive for <b>maduramycin</b> (inhibition zones ≥ 4 mm) not only throughout the WP, but even 5 -day after the elapse of WP. In the case of pheasants, the positive results were detected in the gizzard, liver, heart, kidneys, spleen and lungs. On day 5 of the WP, no positive results were detected, however, on day 6, the heart and spleen were positive again...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or {{substances}} used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the compatibility of microbial feed additive Bacillus subtilis PB 6 with the coccidiostats <b>maduramycin</b> ammonium, monensin sodium, narasin and robenidine hydrochloride. The in vivo compatibility of the coccidiostats with Bacillus subtilis PB 6 was assessed {{as part of a}} larger trial in which performance characteristics were measured. A negative control group was included, while the other groups received the recommended dose of Bacillus subtilis PB 6 in the presence or absence of the tested coccidiostats at their maximum authorised levels. Intestinal samples from six birds per treatment group were analysed for aerobic spore formers. Heat treatment of the samples was included to distinguish spores from vegetative cells. No significant differences in numbers of bacilli were observed between the coccidiostat-treated groups and the group treated with Bacillus subtilis PB 6 alone. Consequently, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that Bacillus subtilis PB 6 is compatible with <b>maduramycin</b> ammonium, monensin sodium, narasin and robenidine hydrochloride when added to diets for chickens for fattening...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the microbial growth inhibition test Total antibiotics for the screening of lasalocid residues in the tissues of broiler chickens after its oral administration in medicated feed. The residues were investigated throughout the 5 -day withdrawal period /WP/) and also on day 6 representing the first day following the WP. All broiler chicken tissues were positive for lasalocid. The breast muscle was positive (the presence of residues at/above the detection limit /LOD/ of method) up to day 1 of the WP, the thigh muscle, gizzard, heart, skin and fat up to day 3 of the WP and the liver and kidneys up to day 4 of the WP. When evaluating the dubious results (the presence of residues just below the LOD of method), the breast muscle was suspect positive up to day 3 of the WP and the gizzard, skin and fat up to day 4 of the WP. No positive or dubious results were detected on day 5 of the WP. The LOD of Bacillus stearothermophilus var. c alidolactis for <b>maduramycin</b> was 500 µg. l - 1. doi: 10. 5219 / 140 </p...|$|E
40|$|Only 3 out of 8 South African {{isolates}} of Plasmodium durae used in 524 turkeys in 161 passages caused approximately 50 % mortality, {{a further}} 3 produced approximately 10 % mortality while 2 {{were found to}} be apathogenic. Exoerythrocytic schizonts were the main pathogenic stage. In most survivors the effect on mass gains was minimal. Twelve drugs currently available for use in poultry, as well as chloroquin phosphate, were tested for their activity against experimental infections with Plasmodium durae in domestic turkeys. While chloroquin phosphate showed a certain degree of effectivity, Amprolium, Amprolium + Ethopabate, <b>Maduramycin,</b> Toltrazuril, Metronidazole, Furazolidone, Enrofloxacin and Sulfamethoxypyridazine + Trimethoprim were ineffective. Halofuginone and Penta-Sulfa at a high dose had some protective effect. At high doses Sulfachloropyrazine protected from mortality without affecting the parasitaemia, while Sulfamonomethoxine suppressed parasitaemia without entirely protecting from mortality. From these data it is concluded that Halofuginone has a potential as possible chemoprophylactic. While a combination of Sulfamonomethoxine and Sulfachloropyrazine could be used in the treatment of outbreaks in the field. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.
