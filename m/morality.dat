5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, <b>morality</b> must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of <b>morality.</b> For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of <b>morality.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{argument}} from <b>morality</b> {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from <b>morality</b> tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of <b>morality</b> and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} <b>morality</b> is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} philosophers, {{including}} Elizabeth Anscombe , Jean Bethke Elshtain , Servais Pinckaers, Iris Murdoch, and the Catholic Encyclopedia, have all {{suggested that the}} Kantian conception of ethics rooted in autonomy is contradictory in its dual contention that humans are co-legislators of <b>morality</b> and that <b>morality</b> is a priori. They argue that if something is universally a priori (i.e., existing unchangingly prior to experience), then it cannot also be in part dependent upon humans, who have not always existed. On the other hand, if humans truly do legislate <b>morality,</b> then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} {{obedience}} and punishment driven <b>morality</b> {{would be a}} child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven <b>morality</b> by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.|$|E

5|$|Because {{evolutionary}} naturalism proposes {{an empirical}} account of <b>morality,</b> {{it does not}} require <b>morality</b> to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism. C. S. Lewis argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human <b>morality</b> cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong. Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part of reality, thus asserting God's existence.|$|E

5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} conceptions of <b>morality</b> and ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic {{typically}} envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence {{are seen as}} intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe {{as a part of}} moral discourse. She looks at the internal source of <b>morality</b> in High Magic, explaining concepts such as that of the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of <b>morality</b> in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E

5|$|Kant {{believed}} that <b>morality</b> is the objective law of reason: just as objective physical laws necessitate physical actions (apples fall {{down because of}} gravity, for example), objective rational laws necessitate rational actions. He thus {{believed that}} a perfectly rational being must also be perfectly moral because a perfectly rational being subjectively finds it necessary {{to do what is}} rationally necessary. Because humans are not perfectly rational (they partly act by instinct), Kant believed that humans must conform their subjective will with objective rational laws, which he called conformity obligation. Kant argued that the objective law of reason is a priori, existing externally from rational being. Just as physical laws exist prior to physical beings, rational laws (<b>morality)</b> exist prior to rational beings. Therefore, according to Kant, rational <b>morality</b> is universal and cannot change depending on circumstance.|$|E
5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise of this argument, {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human <b>morality</b> which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of <b>morality</b> is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of <b>morality</b> to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. <b>Morality</b> might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.|$|E

40|$|Recently Anthropological Theory (8 (4)) {{published}} a debate between Didier Fassin and Wiktor Stoczkowski {{on the question}} of whether or not anthropology should be moral. This debate joins the growing number of anthropologists who have recently argued that <b>moralities</b> should be a social phenomenon of much interest for the discipline. Fassin and Stoczkowski conclude their debate by agreeing that only when anthropologists become reflectively aware of their own moral positions and assumptions can what they call a moral anthropology be safely carried out to investigate local <b>moralities.</b> This moral anthropology, they also both agree, necessitates a new theoretical and methodological framework. In this response article I outline an anthropological theory of <b>moralities</b> that satisfies this need...|$|R
6000|$|Like the Miracle plays, {{most of the}} old <b>Moralities</b> are {{of unknown}} date and origin. Of the known authors of <b>Moralities,</b> {{two of the best}} are John Skelton, who wrote [...] "Magnificence," [...] and {{probably}} also [...] "The Necromancer"; and Sir David Lindsay (1490-1555), [...] "the poet of the Scotch Reformation," [...] whose religious business it was to make rulers uncomfortable by telling them unpleasant truths in the form of poetry. With these men a new element enters into the <b>Moralities.</b> They satirize or denounce abuses of Church and State, and introduce living personages thinly disguised as allegories; so that the stage first becomes a power in shaping events and correcting abuses.|$|R

5|$|Primarily a Bildungsroman and {{adventure}} novel, the novel depicts the emotional tribulations and maturing of an 11-year-old boy.

Marty learns that <b>morality</b> is confounding and must choose between two unpalatable choices: rescuing the abused Shiloh through stealing and lying and allowing Judd to keep abusing Shiloh.|$|E
5|$|Related to the {{argument}} from <b>morality</b> is {{the argument}} from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman proposed that the conscience, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of <b>morality</b> because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.|$|E
