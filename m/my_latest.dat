2500|$|As {{a present}} for his 16th {{birthday}} Weston's father gave him his first camera, a Kodak Bull's-Eye #2, which was a simple box camera. He took it on vacation in the Midwest, {{and by the time}} he returned home his interest in photography was enough to lead him to purchase a used 5 × 7inch view camera. He began photographing in Chicago parks and a farm owned by his aunt, and developed his own film and prints. Later he would remember that even at that early age his work showed strong artistic merit. He said, [...] "I feel that my earliest work of 1903 ‒ though immature ‒ is related more closely, both with technique and composition, to <b>my</b> <b>latest</b> work than are several of my photographs dating from 1913–1920, a period in which I was trying to be artistic." ...|$|E
2500|$|At present, I am {{particularly}} {{excited by}} [...] "bad taste." [...] I have the deep {{feeling that there}} exists in {{the very essence of}} bad taste a power capable of creating those things situated far beyond what is traditionally termed [...] "The Work of Art." [...] I wish to play with human feeling, with its [...] "morbidity" [...] in a cold and ferocious manner. Only very recently I have become a sort of gravedigger of art (oddly enough, I am using the very terms of my enemies). Some of <b>my</b> <b>latest</b> works have been coffins and tombs. During the same time I succeeded in painting with fire, using particularly powerful and searing gas flames, some of them measuring three to four meters high. I use these to bathe the surface of the painting {{in such a way that}} it registered the spontaneous trace of fire.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} after her arrival from Pattaya International Music Festival in Thailand, Nina mentioned {{working on her}} first album under Universal, stating [...] "Expect few pleasant surprises from this new album of mine. We’re {{working very hard to}} make this project truly groundbreaking." [...] On April 15, 2011, she wrote a Pattaya Music Fest article on The Philippine Star where she also talked about the album, saying [...] "Late last year, I moved to my new record label Universal Records and I consider it one of the biggest blessings in my career. In a few months, <b>my</b> <b>latest</b> album will be released, and it will showcase a new, yet familiar Nina, which I hope everyone will appreciate." [...] In May, the label's head Kathleen Dy-Go stated that Nina has not yet finished recording the album, which may result the release date to be pushed back to July or August. On May 31, Nina confirmed that [...] "Hagkan" [...] will be included in the album. On July 15, she confirmed that the album will be released by the end of month, and that they were just finishing up three songs. She further stated that her commitment to the album was the reason behind her constant absence in ASAP. On August 5, 2011, Jay R tweeted that he was working on a collaboration song between Nina and Jimmy Muna. On August 16, Nina tweeted her first publicized picture from the album's photo shoot. In September 2011, she confirmed that the album will finally be released by the last week of the month, proudly expressing the time and effort she exerted for it. She also stated that she did not pressure herself during its production, saying that her main goal is to create a different kind of music for her fans and that she does not expect for it to be a huge hit. Despite announcements, the album was not released until November 2011.|$|E
