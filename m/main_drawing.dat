25|$|With the {{resolution}} of Twin Peaks <b>main</b> <b>drawing</b> point (Laura Palmer's murder) {{in the middle of}} the second season, and with subsequent story lines becoming more obscure and drawn out, public interest began to wane. This discontent, coupled with ABC changing its timeslot on a number of occasions, led to a huge drop in the show's ratings after being one of the most-watched television programs in the United States in 1990. A week after the season's 15th episode placed 85th in the ratings out of 89 shows, ABC put Twin Peaks on indefinite hiatus, a move that usually leads to cancellation.|$|E
500|$|Rounton Grange was {{finished}} in 1876, under the architect Philip Webb; {{it was at}} that time his largest project. The house was five storeys high, of yellow brick with a pantiled roof, enormous mock mediaeval chimneys and [...] "gothic" [...] features. It was set in an estate of 3000 acres with lawns, a wood full of daffodils, a rose garden, and two lakes. Inside was an immense arched gallery that stretched the full width of the house, a wide curved staircase and baronial fireplace. In the <b>main</b> <b>drawing</b> room there was an Adamesque fireplace, and two grand pianos on a vast carpet. There was a large tapestry frieze of Chaucer's [...] Romaunt of the Rose designed by William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, and made by Lady Bell and her daughters over several years.|$|E

50|$|Story manga became vastly {{popular in}} Japan {{and became the}} main revenue source of major print publishers, often surpassing the {{combined}} revenue of book and magazine. Many popular manga started to be serialised weekly. As {{a result of this}} rapid weekly production cycle, detailed drawing in colour became impracticable and Disney-like caricatured faces in black-and-white became the <b>main</b> <b>drawing</b> style of manga.|$|E
50|$|Several of the {{ceilings}} {{in the reception}} halls and master suites depict themes that were dear to Louis XIV, and which are also often seen in Versailles.

50|$|The {{similarity}} {{revealed by}} the X-rays {{in the manner of}} painting the figure of Infant St. John on the examined artwork and the earlier Madonna of the Carnation is an interesting point. The main composition of the examined work can be approximately dated by the time of Madonna of the Carnation's creation (late 1470s - early 1480s.) and corresponds with the date of Leonardo's <b>main</b> <b>drawing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|One of the <b>main</b> <b>drawing</b> {{points for}} fans was its {{unprecedented}} use of digitized voices. German words shouted by the guards, such as [...] "Halt!" [...] (stop!) and [...] "Kommen Sie!" [...] (come!) were frequent. Though limitations in technology only {{allowed for a}} few distorted shouts, the voices added to the game's atmosphere and made Castle Wolfenstein stand out from other games released at the time.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] ballroom or ballhall is a {{large room}} inside a building, the {{designated}} purpose of which is holding large formal parties called balls. Traditionally, most balls were held in private residences; many mansions contain one or more ballrooms. In other large houses, a large room such as the <b>main</b> <b>drawing</b> room, long gallery, or hall may double as a ballroom, but a good ballroom {{should have the right}} type of flooring, such as hardwood flooring or stone flooring (usually marble).|$|E
