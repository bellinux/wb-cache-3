40|$|Abstract. In this {{contribution}} {{we describe}} some applications of geometric algebra {{to the field}} of black hole physics. Our main focus is on the properties of Dirac wavefunctions around black holes. We show the existence of normalised bound state solutions, with an associated decay rate controlled by an imaginary contribution to the energy eigenvalue. This is attributable to the lack of Hermiticity caused by a black hole singularity. We also give a treatment of the Feynman scattering problem for fermions interacting with black holes that we believe is new, and produces an analogue of the <b>Mott</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>formula</b> for the gravitational case. Throughout, the consistent application of geometric algebra simplifies the mathematical treatment and aids understanding by focusing attention on observable quantities. We finish with a brief review of recent work on the effects of torsion in quadratic theories of gravity. This work demonstrates that a free torsion field can {{play a significant role in}} cosmology. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the recent}} past, Mott {{polarimetry}} has been employed only at low electron beam energies (100 keV). Shortly after J. Sromicki demonstrated the rst <b>Mott</b> <b>scattering</b> experiment on lead foils at 14 MeV (MAMI, 1994), a high energy <b>Mott</b> <b>scattering</b> polarimeter was developed at Thomas Je erson National Accelerator Facility (5 MeV, 1995). An instrumental precision of 0. 5 % was achieved due to dramatic improvement in eliminating the background signal {{by means of}} collimation, shielding, time of ight and coincidence methods. Measurements for gold targets between 0. 05 m and 5 m for electron energies between 2 and 8 MeV are presented. A model was developed to explain the depolarization e ects in the target foils due to double scattering. The instrumental helicity correlated asymmetries were measured to smaller than 0. 1 %...|$|R

40|$|Concept of a {{multichannel}} {{electron spin}} detector based on optical imaging principles and <b>Mott</b> <b>scattering</b> (iMott) is presented. A multichannel electron image produced by standard angle-resolving (photo) electron analyzer or microscope is re-imaged by an electrostatic lens at an accelerating voltage of 40 keV onto the Au target. Quasi-elastic electrons bearing spin asymmetry of the <b>Mott</b> <b>scattering</b> are imaged by magnetic lenses onto position-sensitive electron CCDs whose differential signals yield the multichannel spin asymmetry image. Fundamental advantages {{of this concept}} include acceptance of inherently divergent electron sources from the electron analyzer or microscope focal plane as well as small aberrations achieved by virtue of high accelerating voltages, as demonstrated by extensive ray-tracing analysis. The efficiency gain compared to the single-channel Mott detector can be a factor of more than 1 e 4 which opens new prospects of spin-resolved spectroscopies in application not only to standard bulk and surface systems (Rashba effect, topological insulators, etc.) but also to buried heterostructures.

40|$|The <b>Mott</b> <b>scattering</b> of high-energetic twisted {{electrons}} by atoms is investigated {{within the}} framework of the first Born approximation and Dirac's relativistic equation. Special emphasis is placed on the angular distribution and longitudinal polarization of the scattered electrons. In order to evaluate these angular and polarization properties we consider two experimental setups in which the twisted electron beam collides with either a single well-localized atom or macroscopic atomic target. Detailed relativistic calculations have been performed for both setups and for the electrons with kinetic energy from 10 keV to 1000 keV. The results of these calculations indicate that the emission pattern and polarization of outgoing electrons differ significantly from the scattering of plane-wave electrons and can be very sensitive to the parameters of the incident twisted beam. In particular, it is shown that the angular- and polarization-sensitive Mott measurements may reveal valuable information about, both the transverse and longitudinal components of the linear momentum and the projection of the total angular momentum of twisted electron states. Thus, the <b>Mott</b> <b>scattering</b> emerges as a diagnostic tool for the relativistic vortex beams. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the cross section for the {{scattering}} of identical charged bosons is isotropic over a broad angular range around 90 o when the Sommerfeld parameter has a critical value, which depends exclusively on the spin of the particle.

The scattering of identical particles is a routine exercise in quantum mechanics and its discussion can be found in most text books on the subject [1]. However, in recent years, the rapid oscillation seen in the angular distribution of the <b>Mott</b> elastic <b>scattering</b> of identical charged particles such as nuclei, was utilized to test models such as QCD [2, 3] and to discuss small deviations from the Coulomb force law owing to QED-related corrections such as vacuum polarization [4].

40|$|International audiencePrecision {{measurements}} of the relative analyzing powers of five electron beam polarimeters, based on Compton, Møller, and <b>Mott</b> <b>scattering,</b> have been performed using the CEBAF accelerator at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Laboratory). A Wien filter in the 100 keV beam line of the injector was used to vary the electron spin orientation exiting the injector. High statistical precision {{measurements of}} the scattering asymmetry {{as a function of}} the spin orientation were made with each polarimeter. Since each polarimeter receives beam with the same magnitude of polarization, these asymmetry measurements permit a high statistical precision comparison of the relative analyzing powers of the five polarimeters.

Statistically significant disagreements among the values of the beam polarization calculated from the asymmetry measurements made with each polarimeter reveal either errors in the values of the analyzing power or failure to correctly include all systematic effects. The measurements reported here represent a first step toward understanding the systematic effects of these electron polarimeters. Such studies are necessary to realize high absolute accuracy (ca. 1 %) electron polarization measurements, as required for some parity violation measurements planned at Jefferson Laboratory. Finally, a comparison of the value of the spin orientation exiting the injector that provides maximum longitudinal polarization in each experimental hall leads to an independent and very precise (better than 10 − 4) absolute measurement of the final electron beam energy...|$|R
