5|$|Although {{each type}} of tea has {{different}} taste, smell, and visual appearance, tea processing for all tea types consists of a very similar set of methods with only minor variations. Without careful <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> temperature control during its manufacture and life thereafter, fungi will grow on tea. This form of fungus causes real fermentation that will contaminate the tea and may render the tea unfit for consumption.|$|E
40|$|Moisture {{behaviour}} {{of plywood}} is investigated {{in combination with}} detailed structural analysis. In the lab, neutron radiography and X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) were used to map the <b>moisture</b> distribution <b>and</b> internal structure of plywood respectively. In an outdoor natural weathering test, the average <b>moisture</b> content (MC) <b>and</b> <b>moisture</b> distribution of plywood were monitored using a continuous <b>moisture</b> measurement set-up <b>and</b> an adapted electrical method, respectively. The structural changes of the specimens during weathering were recorded by using X-ray CT. Based on the interrelationship of <b>moisture</b> behaviour <b>and</b> structure, suggestions are given for improving the water resistance of plywood by optimising structure...|$|R

5|$|In {{the cases}} of Lake-effect snow and polar lows, the {{convective}} systems form over warm water bodies when cold air sweeps over their surface and leads {{to an increase in}} <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> significant vertical motion.

5|$|It is {{also worth}} {{mentioning}} that sea shells, after collecting, {{need to be}} washed thoroughly in freshwater to remove the salt that is on and in the shell, and then dried thoroughly before they are stored.

40|$|Expressions are {{presented}} for the <b>moisture</b> distribution <b>and</b> the mois ture content {{as a function}} of time of one dimensional homogeneous and composite materials exposed either on one side or on both sides to humid air or to water.

A series of tests using unidirectional and π/ 4 Graphite T- 300 Fiberite 1034 composites were performed in the temperature range 300 — 425 K with the material submerged both in moist air (humidity 0 to 100 %) and in water.

40|$|In this study, {{carboxymethyl}} hyaluronic acid, {{carboxymethyl starch}} and carboxymethyl chitosan were successfully prepared. The characterization of carboxymethyl hyaluronic acid was identified by IR and NMR techniques. The <b>moisture</b> absorption <b>and</b> retention abilities {{of these products}} were examined. Results showed that carboxymethyl hyaluronic acid, as well as carboxymethyl starch and carboxymethyl chitosan, had better <b>moisture</b> absorption <b>and</b> retention abilities both at 43 and 81 % relative humidity than the corresponding polysaccharide and hyaluronic acid. It is concluded that carboxymethylation could improve greatly the <b>moisture</b> absorption <b>and</b> retention abilities of polysaccharides and that carboxymethyl hyaluronic acid, carboxymethyl starch and carboxymethyl chitosan all would be very promising {{to be used as}} <b>moisture</b> absorption <b>and</b> retention ingredients instead of hyaluronic acid in cosmetics and in certain other fields...|$|R

5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = halogen). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, bromides, and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They are very sensitive to <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.|$|E
30|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the possibility of calibrating a prediction model for the <b>moisture</b> content <b>and</b> density distribution of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) using microwave sensors. The material was initially of green <b>moisture</b> content <b>and</b> was thereafter dried in several steps to zero moisture content. At each step, all the pieces were weighed, scanned with a microwave sensor (Satimo 9, 4 [*]GHz), and computed tomography (CT)-scanned with a medical CT scanner (Siemens Somatom AR.T.). The output variables from the microwave sensor were used as predictors, and CT images that correlated with known moisture content were used as response variables. Multivariate models to predict average <b>moisture</b> content <b>and</b> density were calibrated using the partial least squares (PLS) regression. The models for average <b>moisture</b> content <b>and</b> density were applied at the pixel level, and the distribution was visualized. The results show {{that it is possible}} to predict both <b>moisture</b> content distribution <b>and</b> density distribution with high accuracy using microwave sensors.|$|R

5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level <b>moisture,</b> <b>and</b> atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E

Readily adaptable to cultivation, Alloxylon flammeum prefers a site with good drainage and responds well to extra <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> fertilisers low in phosphorus. It is listed nationally as vulnerable under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) as most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and logging.|$|E
5|$|As Debbie {{approached}} the northern Gulf Coast, {{it failed to}} intensify, despite warm sea surface temperatures, abundant <b>moisture,</b> <b>and</b> an anticyclone aloft. In addition, the storm never developed good outflow, partially due to stable air related to Tropical Storm Hazel in the eastern Pacific Ocean. After maintaining peak winds for about 12hours, Debbie weakened due to cooler, drier air, deteriorating to a tropical depression on September29. That day, it turned to the northwest, passing {{just east of the}} Mississippi Delta. On September30, the circulation of Debbie dissipated just offshore Mississippi. Its remnants made landfall, accelerated northeastward, and were eventually absorbed by an extratropical cyclone.|$|E

The results showed the effect of height <b>and</b> <b>moisture</b> content on cutting energy is significant (P< 1 %), but their interaction is not significant. The highest cutting energy was 1. 1 kJ in 25. 5 (w. b. %) <b>moisture</b> content <b>and</b> 10 cm cutting height.

5|$|As Emilia first {{approached}} the southwest coast of Mexico, officials issued {{a tropical storm}} watch from Manzanillo to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco; the watch was discontinued 30hours after it was issued. The storm passed the region on July 22, and {{is believed to have}} produced tropical storm force wind gusts along the coastline. A ship recorded 40mph (65km/h) winds while Emilia was just off the coast. Further up the coast, in Mazatlán, strong waves from the storm caused beaches to close, while the outer fringes of the storm dropped 4.68inches (119mm) of precipitation. Inland, the interaction between Emilia and a tropical wave brought increased <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> precipitation to southeastern and central Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the jet stream {{was at least}} {{partly responsible for the}} widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E
