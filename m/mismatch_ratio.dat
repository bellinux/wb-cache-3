40|$|AbstractFracture {{toughness}} {{of metals}} depends strongly {{on the state}} of stress near the crack tip. The existing standards (like R- 6, SINTAP) are being modified to account for the influence of stress triaxiality in the flaw assessment procedures. These modifications are based on the ability of so-called ‘constraint parameters’ to describe near tip stresses. Crack tip stresses in homogeneous fracture specimens are successfully described in terms of two parameters like J–Q or J–T. For fracture specimens having a weld center crack, strength <b>mismatch</b> <b>ratio</b> between base and weld material and weld width are the additional variables, along with the magnitude of applied loading, type of loading, and geometry of specimen that affect the crack tip stresses. In this work, a novel three-parameter scheme was proposed to estimate the crack tip opening stress accounting for the above-mentioned variables. The first and second parameters represent the crack tip opening stress in a homogeneous fracture specimen under small-scale yielding and are well known. The third parameter accounts for the effect of constraint developed due to weld strength mismatch. It comprises of weld strength <b>mismatch</b> <b>ratio</b> (M, i. e. ratio of yield strength of weld material to that of base material), and a plastic interaction factor (Ip) that scales the size of the plastic zone with the width of the weld material. The plastic interaction factor represents the degree of influence of weld strength mismatch on crack tip constraint for a given <b>mismatch</b> <b>ratio.</b> The proposed scheme was validated with detailed FE analysis using the Modified Boundary Layer formulation...|$|E

40|$|Traceroute is used heavily {{by network}} {{operators}} and researchers {{to identify the}} IP forwarding path from a source to a destination. In practice, knowing the Autonomous System (AS) associated with each hop in the path is also quite valuable. In previous work we showed that the IP-to-AS mapping extracted from BGP routing tables is not sufficient for determining the ASlevel forwarding paths [1]. By comparing BGP and traceroute AS paths from multiple vantage points, [1] proposed heuristics that identify {{the root causes of}} the mismatches and fix the inaccurate IP-to-AS mappings. These heuristics, though effective, are laborintensive and mostly ad hoc. This paper proposes a systematic way to construct accurate IP-to-AS mappings using dynamic programming and iterative improvement. Our algorithm reduces the initial <b>mismatch</b> <b>ratio</b> of 15 % between BGP and traceroute AS paths to 5 % while changing only 2. 9 % of the assignments in the initial IP-to-AS mappings. This is in contrast to the results of [1], where 10 % of the assignments were modified and the <b>mismatch</b> <b>ratio</b> was only reduced to 9 %. We show that our algorithm is robust and can yield near-optimal results even when the initial mapping is corrupted or when the number of probing sources or destinations is reduced.

We illustrate the possible mechanism by exploring predictive factors of late distal SINE after hybrid arch elephant trunk repair for aortic dissection. MethodsFrom November 2006, to May 2011, 20 of 99 patients underwent hybrid arch repair using the elephant trunk graft as the proximal landing zone. After a mean follow-up period of 27. 9  ±  12. 0 months, 12 patients had late distal SINE {{events and the}} others were free of events. False lumen remodeling level was observed and maximal longitudinal diameter, average of longitudinal and transverse maximal diameter, circumference, and area of true lumen were analyzed for precise size selection of stent graft before and after the procedure. Taper ratio, true lumen:aorta ratio, prestent grafting oversizing ratio, poststent grafting oversizing ratio, and expansion <b>mismatch</b> <b>ratio</b> of distal true lumen were proposed and calculated for further evaluation of the mechanism of late distal SINE. ResultsOnly the area oversizing ratio between true lumen and the distal selected stent graft at the presumed distal end of stent grafting was found as a significant predictive factor of SINE before procedure (4. 00  ±  2. 96 vs 1. 98  ±  0. 66 for SINE vs non-SINE, respectively; P = . 031). The significant difference of the expansion <b>mismatch</b> <b>ratio</b> of true lumen between the 2 groups was found not only in the size measurement of mean diameter (1. 48  ±  0. 29 vs 1. 22  ±  0. 15; P = . 039), but also in the area (2. 39  ±  0. 85 vs 1. 58  ±  0. 42; P = . 031) and circumference (1. 43  ±  0. 27 vs 1. 18  ±  0. 14; P = . 016) after stent grafting.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicenter study of 74 consecutive stroke patients admitted to academic stroke centers in North America and Europe. An MRI scan was obtained immediately before and 3 to 6 hours after treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator 3 to 6 hours after symptom onset.

The {{purpose of the}} study was to assess the reliability of PCT in predicting clinical outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with acute hemispheric ischemic stroke were investigated with PCT and treated with IAT between 3 and 6 hours of stroke onset. The infarct core was outlined on cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps by using accepted viability thresholds. The penumbra was defined as time-to-peak (TTP) -CBV mismatch. Clinical outcome was assessed by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 3 months and dichotomized into favorable (mRS score, 0 - 2) and unfavorable (mRS score, 3 - 6). Data were retrospectively analyzed by multiple regression to identify predictors of clinical outcome among the following variables: age, sex, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, serum glucose level, thrombolytic agent, infarct core and mismatch size, collateral circulation, time to recanalization, and recanalization rate after IAT. RESULTS: Patients with favorable outcome had smaller cores (P =. 03), increased <b>mismatch</b> <b>ratios</b> (P =. 03), smaller final infarct sizes (P <. 01), higher recanalization rates (P =. 03), and reduced infarct growth rates (P <. 01), compared with patients with unfavorable outcome.

Evidence of strain hardening due to the constraint and thermo-mechanical cycles during the welding process was found in the heat-affected zone and evidence of softening was observed in the pre-strained base metal. It was found that the heat treatment process removed the effect of pre-straining and welding on the proof stress and the strength along the specimen was nearly homogenized. However, mapping the local stress–strain curves in the as-welded cross-weld specimens with pre-strained base metal has revealed abnormal strain relaxation with increase in load in the weld-affected region. For a better understanding of this behaviour, a tensile test of a cross-weld specimen with a large strength mismatch between the weld metal and the base metal was simulated using the finite element method. It was found that the strength mismatch in the specimen causes the development of biaxial stresses in the heat-affected zone once local yielding begins, and the use of global axial stress to construct the local stress–strain curve results in an apparent ‘reduced-strain’ anomaly. Nevertheless, for the strength <b>mismatch</b> <b>ratios</b> studied, this anomalous behaviour did not seem to significantly affect the determination of the local proof stress in the specimens...|$|R

This algorithm follows on the authors' previous works on the parallel and serial concatenated turbo codes and low-density parity-check codes.
