Clinical Psychologist Michael Friedman writes that the use of Native imagery, in particular the use of a dictionary defined slur, is a form of bullying, the negative impact of which is magnified by its being officially sanctioned.|$|E
500|$|Marissa Higgins, {{writing for}} xoJane, {{contended that the}} show [...] "didn't {{accomplish}} anything with their portrayal of sexual assault" [...] {{and said that she}} disliked the way that the story ended with Doggett effectively quitting her job as van driver in order to avoid further contact with Coates. Emma Eisenberg, of Salon, criticized the scenes depicting Doggett growing up in Waynesboro as being [...] "riddled with excessive Appalachian clichés". She went further by calling Doggett's mother unrealistic in her attitude towards sex: [...] "the mothers I met [...] wanted their daughters to understand sex and to make informed choices". Eisenberg claimed that, therefore, Doggett's mother's speech about sex − [...] "it’s like a bee sting, in and out, over before you knew it was happening" [...] − was not representative of people in Waynesboro at that time. Chloe Stillwell completely disagreed with Eisenberg and insisted that the character of Doggett was realistic: [...] "Eisenberg's argument completely <b>misses</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that perhaps the show is trying to be as real as possible, and acknowledging that there are real life Pennsatuckies in this world isn't to disenfranchise Appalachia." ...|$|E

2500|$|The idea of atonement for sin is {{criticized by}} Richard Dawkins {{on the grounds}} that the image of God as {{requiring}} the suffering and death of Jesus to effect reconciliation with humankind is immoral. The view is summarized by Dawkins: [...] "if God wanted to forgive our sins, why not just forgive them? Who is God trying to impress?" [...] Oxford theologian Alister McGrath maintains that Dawkins is [...] "ignorant" [...] of Christian theology, and therefore unable to engage religion and faith intelligently. He goes on to say that the atonement was necessary because of our flawed human nature, which made it impossible for us to save ourselves, and that it expresses God's love for us by removing the sin that stands in the way of our reconciliation with God. Responding to the criticism that he is [...] "ignorant" [...] of theology, Dawkins asks, [...] "Do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in leprechauns?" [...] and [...] "es, I have, of course, met this point before. It sounds superficially fair. But it presupposes that there is something in Christian theology to be ignorant about. The entire thrust of my position is that Christian theology is a non-subject." [...] Dinesh D'Souza says that Dawkins' criticism [...] "only makes sense if you assume Christians made the whole thing up." [...] He goes on to say that Christians view it as a beautiful sacrifice, and that [...] "through the extremity of Golgotha, Christ reconciles divine justice and divine mercy." [...] Andrew Wilson argues that Dawkins <b>misses</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of the atonement, which has nothing to do with masochism, but is based on the concepts of holiness, sin and grace.|$|E

As part of their plans to destroy the Aryans, Chamberlain claimed that the Jews had founded the Roman Catholic Church, which only preached a [...] "Judaized" [...] Christianity {{that had nothing to do}} with the Christianity created by the Aryan Christ. At least some historians have argued that The Foundations are actually more anti-Catholic than anti-Semitic, but this <b>misses</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that the reason why Chamberlain attacked the Catholic Church so fiercely was because he believed the Papacy was controlled by the Jews. In the 16th century, Chamberlain claimed that the Aryan Germans under the leadership of Martin Luther had broken away from the corrupt influence of Rome, and so laid the foundations of a [...] "Germanic Christianity". Chamberlain claimed that the natural and best form of government for Aryans was a dictatorship, and so he blamed the Jews for inventing democracy as part of their plans for destroying the Aryans. In the same way, Chamberlain blamed capitalism-which he saw as a very destructive economic system-as something invented by the Jews to enrich themselves at the expense of the Aryans while at the same time crediting the Jews with inventing socialism with its message of universal human equality as a cunning Jewish stratagem to divert attention away from all the economic devastation wrought by Jewish financiers. Chamberlain's relentless determination to prove that everything he viewed as evil in the world as the work of the Jews led him to some odd conclusions. Chamberlain had a deep dislike of the Chinese, and so in [...] The Foundations he announced that Chinese civilization had been founded by the Jews because just like the Jews the Chinese had [...] "...the total absence of all culture and the one-sided emphasizing of civilization." [...] For Chamberlain, this was more than sufficient proof that the Jews had created Chinese civilization.|$|E
