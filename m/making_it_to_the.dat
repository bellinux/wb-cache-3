5|$|Due to his size, McGrattan {{believed}} his {{best chance of}} <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NHL was as an enforcer. Dennis Bonvie, the all-time penalty leader in professional hockey, taught {{him to be a}} better fighter while the two were teammates in Binghamton. After posting 173 PIM in 2002–03, McGrattan finished second in the AHL with 327 in 2003–04. He then set an AHL single-season record for penalties with 551 in 2004–05.|$|E
5|$|Joe Dante was {{the next}} choice, {{increasing}} the budget for his idea of Daniel Day-Lewis as a brooding Mummy. This version (a draft was written by Alan Ormsby, but it was later re-written by John Sayles) was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story. It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final product. However, at that point, the studio wanted a film with a budget of $15million and rejected Dante's version.|$|E

5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, {{convinced}} {{that they could not}} possibly survive the trip through the Grand Canyon. They were killed by Native Americans after <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E

5|$|Placed {{in a tough}} {{group for}} {{qualification}} to the 1970 FIFA World Cup, Scotland failed to qualify after finishing in second place. Bremner captained his country throughout the process, having first taken up the armband in a friendly defeat by Denmark in Copenhagen. He scored his first international goal in a 2–1 qualifying victory over Austria at Hampden Park, his first game as captain. This game was followed by two victories over Cyprus and a 1–1 draw with West Germany, however a 3–2 defeat by West Germany in Hamburg ended their hopes of <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> World Cup. Bremner's second international goal came in a 3–2 win over Wales in a British Home Championship game at the Racecourse Ground.|$|E
5|$|The 1989 Draft {{has been}} noted as having been {{exceptionally}} successful for Detroit. While team executive Jim Devellano stated the team would be satisfied with two players from that draft <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NHL, seven of them did so. Those seven players (Mike Sillinger, Bob Boughner, Lidstrom, Fedorov, Shawn McCosh, Dallas Drake and Vladimir Konstantinov) amassed 5,995 games played, 1,227 goals, 2,367 assists, 3,594 points and 5,108 penalties in minutes. That draft has also been marked as signalling a paradigm shift for Detroit as prior to that the club was very reluctant to draft players from outside North America. Since then the club has drafted {{a large number of}} European as well as other non-North American players. In 2000, for example, they drafted four Swedes, three Russians, two Canadians, one Slovak and one American.|$|E
5|$|The National Competitiveness Council of the Philippines which {{annually}} {{publishes the}} Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index (CMCI), ranks the cities, municipalities and provinces {{of the country}} according to their economic dynamism, government efficiency and infrastructure.

5|$|The {{club has}} seen its share of struggles, {{both on and off}} the ice. The team has had two changes of ownership, from Firestone to Rod Bryden in 1993 due to the arena {{development}} process and its financing, and subsequently to Eugene Melnyk after the team filed for bankruptcy in 2003. On the ice, the club finished last in the League in its first four seasons. Changes in hockey management have led to steady improvement of the team's play, resulting in the team qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs in 11 of the last 12 seasons, winning the Presidents' Trophy in 2002–03 and <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Stanley Cup Finals in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In early 2004, Cena {{participated in}} the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final six before being {{eliminated}} by Big Show. Chris Benoit was the eventual winner of the match. The Royal Rumble elimination led to a feud with Big Show. At No Way Out, Cena faced Big Show and Kurt Angle in a triple threat match to earn a WWE Championship match, with Angle beating Cena by submission. Cena won his first singles championship in WWE, the United States Championship from Big Show at WrestleMania XX after delivering an F-U for the pinfall victory. The reign ended almost four months after successful title defences against the likes of Rene Dupree, Rob Van Dam and Booker T, when he was stripped of the title on the July 8 episode of SmackDown! by Angle after he accidentally knocked him over, thus attacking an official. Cena won the championship back defeating Booker T in a best of five series that culminated at No Mercy, only to drop it to the débuting Carlito Caribbean Cool the following week on SmackDown!. After the loss to Carlito, the duo began a feud, which resulted in Cena allegedly being stabbed in the kidney while at a Boston-area nightclub by Carlito's bodyguard, Jesús. This worked injury was used to keep Cena out of action for a month while Cena was filming The Marine. Immediately on his return in November, Cena won the United States Championship back from Carlito. Cena later successfully defended the championship against Jesus at Armageddon in a street fight match.|$|E

Robert informs Ryu that Irene Lew has been captured and that he must go to the Tower of Lahja to save her. After hopping on a freight train and then battling up the mountain in which the tower lies, he is ambushed by a figure who describes himself as a tribesman of the World of Chaos, led by the Emperor of Darkness Ashtar. After <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the tower, Ryu finds Irene, who has been captured by Ashtar. Ashtar then blasts Ryu with energy from his own sword; before Ashtar can finish off Ryu, Robert appears and shoots Ashtar in the back, stopping him. Robert orders Ashtar to hand over his sword and give up, but Ashtar escapes with Irene, telling Ryu to follow him into the Maze of Darkness.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade {{carried out}} a brigade-sized {{parachute}} landing during Operation Dragoon. On 15 August 1944 the brigade's pathfinders landed {{in the south of}} France and set up Eureka beacons to guide the main brigade force to their drop zones. Despite the pathfinders' success at marking the drop zones, only seventy-three planes placed their parachutists in the correct location. The brigade commanding officer and eighty men were landed near Fayence, as were the 5th (Scottish) Battalion's commanding officer, with half of battalion headquarters, 'C' Company, and 'D' Company. Other men were landed as far away as Cannes. The dispersed landings resulted in only about forty percent of the 4th Battalion <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brigade forming-up point. Only seventy percent of the 6th (Welch) Battalion and only a single company of the 5th (Scottish) Battalion had arrived. The brigade headquarters was established at Le Mitan with the 5th (Scottish) Battalion company by 04:00, and by 07:30 the 4thBattalion had occupied the heights at Le Muy. The 6th (Welch) Battalion occupied La Motte and, when the Germans at Clastron surrendered, moved a company into the village. Le Serres was captured by 'C' Company, 4th Battalion, as was the bridge over the River Naturby on the road to Le Muy.|$|E
