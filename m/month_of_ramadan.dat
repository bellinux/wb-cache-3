5|$|The {{preparation}} of haleem {{has been compared}} to that of Hyderabadi biryani. Though Hyderabadi haleem is the traditional hors d'oeuvre at weddings, celebrations and other social occasions, it is particularly consumed in the Islamic <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan</b> during Iftar (the evening meal that breaks the day-long fast) as it provides instant energy and is high in calories. This has made the dish synonymous with Ramadan. In recognition of its cultural significance and popularity, in 2010, it was granted Geographical Indication status (GIS) by the Indian GIS registry office, making it the first non-vegetarian dish in India to get this status.|$|E

5|$|Ahmad ibn Tulun {{was born}} on the 23rd day of the <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan</b> 220 AH (20 September 835) or {{slightly}} later, probably in Baghdad. His father, Tulun, was a Turk from a locality known in Arabic sources as Tagharghar or Toghuzghuz, i.e. the Uyghur confederation. In the year 815/6 (200 AH) Tulun was taken captive along with other Turks, and sent {{as part of the}} tribute of the Samanid governor of Bukhara Nuh ibn Asad to the Caliph al-Ma'mun (reigned 813–833), who at the time resided in Khurasan. After al-Ma'mun returned to Baghdad in 819, these Turkish slaves were formed into a guard corps of slave soldiers (ghilmān, sing. ghulām) entrusted to al-Ma'mun's brother and eventual successor, al-Mu'tasim (r. 833–842). Tulun did well for himself, eventually coming to command the Caliph's private guard. Ahmad's mother, called Qasim, was one of his father's slaves. In 854/5, Tulun died, and Qasim is commonly held to have married a second time, to the Turkish general Bayakbak or Bakbak. This report, however, does not appear in Ibn al-Daya or al-Balawi, and may be spurious. According to al-Balawi, after his father's death Ahmad came under the tutelage of Yalbakh, a close companion of Tulun, who had been taken captive alongside him. At his deathbed, Tulun urged his friend {{to take care of his}} wife and son, and Bakbak thereafter treated the young Ahmad as his own son.|$|E

As a practicing Muslim, he observes fasting during the Islamic holy <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan.</b> His grandfather, Da Lakehal Benzema, lived in the village of Tigzirt, located in the northern town of Beni Djellil in Algeria before migrating to Lyon, where he eventually settled in the 1950s. Benzema's father, Hafid, {{was born in}} Tigzirt, while his mother, Wahida Djebbara, {{was born and raised in}} Lyon; her family originated from Oran. Benzema is the third youngest in the family and grew up with eight other siblings in Bron, an eastern suburb of Lyon. His younger brothers Gressy and Sabri are also footballers. The former currently plies his trade at the amateur level with Vaulx-le-Velin in the Division d'Honneur, the sixth division of French football, while the latter plays in the youth academy of a club in the family's hometown of Bron.

The Government funds all official religious institutions, including Shi'a and Sunni mosques, Shi'a ma`tams (religious community centers), Shi'a and Sunni waqfs (religious endowments), and the religious courts, which represent both the Ja'afari (Shi'a) and Maliki (Sunni) schools of Islamic jurisprudence.

5|$|When 27 August, fifteen {{days before}} 7 September, passed without a reply from either Sadat or Assad, {{it was clear}} no {{offensive}} would take place in September. During 28 and 29 August, Sadat met with Assad in Damascus, where they agreed to start the war in October. They specified October 6 as D-Day, and informed Ahmed Ismail and Tlass on 22 September, who in turn relayed the decision to the Chiefs of Staff. At the request of Ahmed Ismail, Sadat produced a presidential directive for war. Therefore, {{it was only in}} September, less than a month before the attack, that the date October 6 was finally selected as D-Day. The coordinated offensive would begin at 14:00 (Cairo Local Time). October 6 was chosen for several reasons. The speed of the water current and the tide were optimal for a crossing operation, and for most of the night there was a full moon, facilitating bridge construction. The date coincided with Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. This was an important factor in choosing October 6 for an attack; observant Jews fast on that day, abstain from the use of fire or electricity (which meant transportation would be at a standstill), and much of the Israeli army would be demobilised. October also coincided with the <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan</b> in the Muslim Calendar, which meant that Muslim soldiers would be fasting. It was in Ramadan that the Muslims won their first victory at the Battle of Badr in the year 634. Opting for something more inspirational than the High Minarets as a name, Operation Badr was chosen by Egyptian commanders as the codename for the assault.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Muslim {{women are}} not allowed to perform {{religious}} ceremonies in menstrual period. Some of them use oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) to delay menstruation, which can lead to cerebral venous - sinus thrombosis (CVST). Therefore, the incidence of CVST is significantly higher in Iranian women. Thrombosis incidence is directly related to estrogen level of OCPs. In this study, the estrogen level of OPCs was evaluated in a group of female CVST patients. Methods: This study was conducted from 2010 to 2011, including two consecutive <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan</b> in Zanjan Province of Iran. The remaining tablets of patients with CVST and OCP consumption history were analyzed by HPLC method. Results: Of 32 female CVST patients, 27 patients had a history of OCPs consumption. 24 cases of them consumed LD. Analysis of LD tablets revealed normal level of estrogen except for one case. Conclusion: Using contraceptive products among Muslim women in incorrect manner to delay menstruation should be considered by healthcare system. It is recommended to decrease amount of estrogen in OCPs till their contraceptive effect is unaffected...|$|R

A complete business cycle has been elapsed (2002 - 2010) since their study, so there is need to review the results with additional information. This revisited attempt, based on a theoretically specified framework, arrived at similar results and found significant impact of Islamic calendar. The Islamic <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan</b> and Zilhaj have positive impact on currency holdings and negative impact on deposits. Although stylized facts indicate that consumer prices are significantly higher during Ramadan but econometric investigation rejects the upward exogenous shifts in prices during Ramadan. Therefore, structural relationship analyzed in co-integration framework has shown that inflation is not directly impacted by the Ramadan but indirectly through increase in its determinants. Inflationary tendencies during Ramadan are not due to exogenous increase by producers and retailers but possibly due to demand surge in the wake of redistribution <b>of</b> income. The <b>months</b> <b>of</b> June and December have positive effects on deposits and negative effects on currency in circulation indicating the presence of window dressing. Finally, as seasonal factors have important role in determining economic time series, therefore, ignoring those in monthly time series models will lead to omitted variable bias and inappropriate forecasts. ...|$|R
