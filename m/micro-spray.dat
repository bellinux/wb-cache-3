50|$|Micro-irrigation, {{sometimes}} called localized irrigation, low volume irrigation, or trickle irrigation {{is a system}} where water is distributed under low pressure through a piped network, in a pre-determined pattern, and applied as a small discharge to each plant or adjacent to it. Traditional drip irrigation using individual emitters, subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), <b>micro-spray</b> or micro-sprinkler irrigation, and mini-bubbler irrigation all belong to this category of irrigation methods.|$|E
50|$|Modern drip {{irrigation}} has arguably become the world's most valued innovation in agriculture since {{the invention of}} the impact sprinkler in the 1930s, which offered the first practical alternative to surface irrigation. Drip irrigation may also use devices called <b>micro-spray</b> heads, which spray water in a small area, instead of dripping emitters. These are generally used on tree and vine crops with wider root zones. Subsurface {{drip irrigation}} (SDI) uses permanently or temporarily buried dripperline or drip tape located at or below the plant roots. It is becoming popular for row crop irrigation, especially in areas where water supplies are limited or recycled water is used for irrigation. Careful study of all the relevant factors like land topography, soil, water, crop and agro-climatic conditions are needed to determine the most suitable drip irrigation system and components to be used in a specific installation.|$|E

50|$|The Huon-Stuehrer nozzle is {{primarily}} used within {{the food and}} pharmaceutical industries. One {{of the most common}} applications is in the glazing of comestibles, for example shellac <b>micro-spraying</b> onto chocolate-coated confectionery.|$|R
50|$|Shellac coating {{applied with}} either a {{standard}} or modified Huon-Stuehrer nozzle, can be economically <b>micro-sprayed</b> onto various smooth sweets, such as chocolate coated peanuts. Irregularities {{on the surface of}} the product being sprayed typically result in the formation of unsightly aggregates ("lac-aggs") which precludes the use of this technique on foods such as walnuts or raisins (however, chocolate-coated raisins being smooth surfaced, are able to be sprayed successfully using a modified Huon-Stuehrer nozzle).|$|R
50|$|The raisins are {{coated with}} oil and spun in a hot drum filled with {{chocolate}} to cover them. A coating of shellac is then usually <b>micro-sprayed</b> onto the surface (typically using a modified Huon-Stuehrer nozzle operating at 60 degrees C / 20-30 psi pressure) to give them their characteristic shiny coating. The size of the finished product is not as uniform as most candy products, due to the inherent variability in size of the underlying raisin. Although size differential is not widely regarded as a significant factor with regard to consumer acceptability, some industry pundits believe this may explain why this type of product, whilst popular enough to continue production, is unlikely to impact on the sales margins of other well established and uniformly-sized confectionery.|$|R

40|$|Remotely-sensed canopy {{temperature}} from {{infrared thermometer}} (IRT) sensors {{has long been}} shown to be effective for detecting plant water stress. A field study was conducted to investigate peach tree responses to deficit irrigation which was controlled using canopy to air temperature difference (ΔT) during the postharvest period at the USDA-ARS (U. S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service) San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Sciences Center in Parlier, California, USA. The experimental site consisted of a 1. 6 ha early maturing peach tree orchard. A total of 18 IRT sensors were used to control six irrigation treatments including furrow, <b>micro-spray,</b> and surface drip irrigation systems with and without postharvest deficit irrigation. During the postharvest period in the 2012 – 2013 and 2013 – 2014 growing seasons, ΔT threshold values at mid-day was tested to trigger irrigation in three irrigation systems. The results showed that mid-day stem water potentials (ψ) for well irrigated trees were maintained at a range of − 0. 5 to − 1. 2 MPa while ψ of deficit irrigated trees dropped to lower values. Soil water content in deficit surface drip irrigation treatment was higher compared to deficit furrow and <b>micro-spray</b> irrigation treatments in 2012. The number of fruits and fruit weight from peach trees under postharvest deficit irrigation treatment were less than those well-watered trees; however, no statistically significant (at the p < 0. 05 level) reduction in fruit size or quality was found for trees irrigated by surface drip and <b>micro-spray</b> irrigation systems by deficit irrigation. Beside doubles, we found an increased number of fruits with deep sutures and dimples which may be a long-term (seven-year postharvest regulated deficit irrigation) impact of deficit irrigation on this peach tree variety. Overall, deployment of IRT sensors provided real-time measurement of canopy water status and the information is valuable for making irrigation management decisions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{irrigation}} on {{the abundance of}} Empoasca vitis (Go¨ the) populations was investigated in four vineyards located in northeastern Italy. In two experiments, we compared leafhopper population densities in plots irrigated (<b>micro-spray</b> irrigation system) or nonirrigated. In another experiment, we studied the effect of various irrigation systems on E. vitis populations over two successive seasons. In particular, Þve treatments were compared: control (not irrigated), traditional drip system, three types of subirrigation varying in distance from the row (40, 135, and 95 cm). In this vineyard, stem water potential was monitored with a pressure chamber. E. vitis population densities were affected by irrigation, with higher densities of this pest recorded on irrigated vines. Highest E. vitis densities were detected in drip irrigation plots compared with nonirrigated plots where water stress was highest. Moderate water stress (subirrigation plots) was associated with intermediate leafhopper densities. Implications for integrated pest management are discussed...|$|E

40|$|A {{flexible}} high-level {{control language}} {{is an important}} element in the continued task of introducing mobile agents to new application domains. One such new application domain is the use of a small mobile agent in a agricultural row crop field performing intra-row weeding. This paper defines requirements and scope of a process and behaviour based scripting language needed to control the weeding agent in an agricultural row crop. The basis is the transparent and tactical SMR-CL (Small Mobile Robot Control Language). SMR-CL is a realtime control language for mobile robots modified to include necessary motion commands and a supplemental supervisory function to record the progressing coverage of the field. The control language is applied to a case presenting typical field conditions for row crops. The case stresses the importance of including goal-directing modules like the Supervisory Field Coverage Monitor (SFCM) to coordinate the behaviours. The applicability of the modified SMR language has been successful demonstrated through the vehicle test in an artificial row crop. The analysis of the operational performance of the SMR has revealed its field capacity and rendered probable the scenario of equipping and implementing small weeding agents with a <b>micro-spraying</b> system requiring less than 10 % of normal herbicide dosage. ...|$|R
40|$|Increases in {{microprocessor}} {{power dissipation}} coupled with reductions in feature sizes due to manufacturing process improvements {{have resulted in}} continuously increasing heat fluxes. The ever increasing chip-level heat flux has necessitated the development of thermal management devices based on spray and evaporative cooling. This lecture presents {{a comprehensive review of}} liquid and evaporative cooling research applied to thermal management of electronics. It also outlines the challenges to practical implementation and future research needs. This presentation also describes the development of EDIFICE: Embedded Droplet Impingement For Integrated Cooling of Electronics. The EDIFICE project seeks to develop an integrated droplet impingement cooling device for removing chip heat fluxes over 100 W/cm 2, employing latent heat of vaporization of dielectric fluids. Micro-manufacturing and MEMS (Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems) will be discussed as enabling technologies for innovative cooling schemes recently proposed. <b>Micro-spray</b> nozzles are fabricated to produce 50 - 100 micron droplets coupled with surface texturing on the backside of the chip to promote droplet spreading and evaporation. A novel feature to enable adaptive on-demand cooling is MEMS sensing (on-chip temperature, remote IR temperature and ultrasonic dielectric film thickness) and MEMS actuation. EDIFICE is integrated within the electronics package and fabricated using advanced micro-manufacturing technologies (e. g., Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) and CMOS CMU-MEMS). The development of EDIFICE involves modeling, CFD simulations, and physical experimentation on test beds. This lecture will then examine jet impingement cooling of EDIFICE with a dielectric coolant and the influence of fluid properties, micro spray characteristics, and surface evaporation.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Even though {{considerable}} {{research has}} been devoted to the drying of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and other pharmaceutical proteins, the majority of this research has focused on lyophilisation or spray drying (SD) for inhalation. Powders for reconstitution and subcutaneous (SC) injection need to comply with a significantly different set of product characteristics than those for inhalation. Therefore, following a formulation screening, the impact of spray drying process parameters on both powder characteristics and short- and long-term stability was determined for a model mAb formulation, using a design of experiments (DoE) approach that combined statistical tools with a set of orthogonal analytical techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS The mAb formulation was spray dried using a ProCepT <b>Micro-Spray</b> with inlet air flow rate, inlet air temperature, nozzle air flow rate, feed rate, feed concentration and nozzle diameter as factors which were varied at three levels according to a D-optimal design. The following responses were measured and evaluated for this study: Yield, angle of repose, residual water content (Karl Fischer titration), reconstitution time, particle size distribution (laser diffraction), particle morphology (SEM), solid state characterisation (XRPD and DSC), aggregation (SEC, DLS, OD 600). RESULTS Descriptive statistical models were obtained for several responses, suggesting the inlet air flow rate {{to be one of the}} overall most influential process parameters. Large variations in particle morphology were observed with SEM, revealing that particle size distribution models, although statistically significant, were not representative for any relevant powder property. Additionally, the location of powder collection, i. e. collector/cyclone versus transport tube, had a noticeable influence on the particle size distribution of the spray dried powders. CONCLUSIONS Descriptive models were generated for a model mAb, which could prove to be useful tools in improving our understanding of process parameter influences on the mAb stability and particle characteristics of powders for reconstitution. The presented data also emphasises the importance of using orthogonal techniques and keeping the physicochemical meaning of responses in mind when designing a (bio) pharmaceutical drying process. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{are being}} {{conducted}} which aim {{to improve the}} efficiency of irrigation and N fertilization for lemons produced on sandy soils in the low desert The first experiment evaluates the response of 'Lisbon' lemons to various flood irrigation intervals. Irrigation intervals are based on soil moisture depletion (SMD) as calculated from frequent neutron probe soil moisture measurements. Individual treatments were irrigated when total SMI) was 25 %, 40 %, 55 %, and 70 %, respectively. The second experiment compares the performance of young lemons produced under flood, trickle, and <b>micro-spray</b> irrigation systems. The third experiment evaluates the response of young lemons to water and N combinations (3 by 3 factorial) under micro - spray irrigation. The three irrigation rates were targeted for 30 cnbar, 20 cnbar, and 10 cnbar tension. The three N rates were 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 4 kg N/tree. One flood irrigation treatment was added for comparative purposes. Overall, results obtained in experiment 1 during 1994, 1995, and 1996 indicate optimal fruit growth and yield is obtained at approximately 40 % SMD. The results of experiment 2 show that after 3 years, only micro-jet irrigation produced less tree growth than flood irrigation. In 1995, first year fruit yields were significantly greater for pressurized irrigation compared to flood irrigation. However, by 1996 {{there were no differences}} in yield to irrigation treatment. Results from experiment 3 show a linear response in tree growth to irrigation. In 1994 and 1995, tree growth at the high micro - spray soil moisture regime was significantly greater than trees irrigated by flood. However, in 1996 where we failed to increase the micro-spay irrigation time to meet the increased water demand by the trees, the flood irrigation regime was superior. Yields were also increased to irrigation. There {{were no significant differences in}} tree growth to N fertilization rates in 1994 and 1995. However, there was increased tree growth in 1996 and a yield increase to N fertilizer rate at the highest soil moisture regime...|$|E
40|$|The {{failure of}} most new {{chemical}} entities {{to reach the}} market is mainly due to their drugability problems. The main causes of their drugability problem is poor bioavailability {{as the result of}} poor solubility or/and poor permeability through the GI wall. Various formulation strategies showed their capability to improve the kinetic solubility and dissolution rate of poorly water soluble drugs. The general introduction section merely focused on solid form modifications as a formulation strategy for poorly water soluble drugs. Solid dispersions are comparably discussed in detail including their preparation methods, stabilization mechanisms and the hurdles for the success of ASD in commercialized drug products with elaborate literature examples. Alternate solid forms, polymorphic forms and amorphous forms can also lead to differences in molecular, particulate and bulk level properties of the drug which can affect the bioavailability and processability of the drug. Therefore the relation of solid forms on physicochemical properties is also discussed briefly with practical examples. In addition, the solid form of drugs may also change during manufacturing which is briefly covered in the introduction section. An overview of pharmaceutical tableting, popular models to study the volume-pressure relation during compression and the mechanism and the consequences of plastic deformation of glassy polymers are also discussed. The general and specific objectives are further pointed out in chapter 2. The main objective of the project was to understand the role of compression on the structural and physical stability of amorphous solid dispersions and amorphous forms of pure drug. The glass forming properties and the glass stability of the amorphous form of pure drugs may play a role on the physical stability of amorphous solid dispersions. Indomethacin is a good glass former with relatively good physical stability. Amorphous indomethacin was prepared by cooling the molten sample rapidly (25 &# 176;C/min) or slowly (0. 2 &# 176;C/min) to room temperature. The experimental protocols were devoid of stresses applied during sample transfer and preparation for analysis since compression and further analysis by thermal, vibrational spectroscopy and PXRD techniques were performed in the primary containers (DSC standard aluminum pan). Amorphous indomethacin generated from the gamma polymorphic form showed aging time dependent non-isothermal crystallization first predominantly to the stable gamma form and then to the metastable alfa-form of crystalline indomethacin. However, it crystallized to the stable gamma-form after a long period of storage. Compression enhanced and also increased the overall crystallization of amorphous indomethacin as evidently shown with high heat of crystallisation and lower crystallisation temperature. The tendency of crystallisation to the metastable alfa-form was higher for amorphous indomethacin prepared by fast cooling than by slow cooling from the melt. However, enthalpy recovery with physical aging was not consistently correlated with the crystallization tendency of the compressed and the uncompressed amorphous indomethacin. The origin of the selective crystallization with physical aging was not clearly understood. Unfavorable storage conditions such as elevated temperature and humidity may lead to phase transformation of solid dispersions from amorphous to crystalline or/and separation to multiple amorphous domains. Amorphous solid dispersions' success in improving bioavailability has not been reflected in the number of marketed products due to physical stability problems. Tablets are the most popular dosage forms hence most of marketed drug products of solid dispersions are tablets and capsules. Compression is an important stage of tablet manufacturing and understanding its consequences such as segmental dynamics, structural and thermodynamic changes in solid dispersions has a vital role {{on the quality of the}} final product. In chapter 4, we investigated the effect of compression on amorphous-amorphous phase separation in solid dispersions. The effect of compression was overt on the metastable amorphous solid dispersions with 30 % and 40 % (w/w) drug loadings in NAP &# 822; PVP K 25 compositions where two distinct Tgs or a wider single Tg were observed for compressed NAP &# 822; PVP ASD. These may be ascribed to the distortion of drug-polymer specific interaction as evidently shown on the IR profile. Solid dispersions with low drug loading (20 % w/w) showed no difference in the glass transition and also IR profile among compressed and uncompressed samples. This indicates that the relatively stable ASD with high polymer composition can withstand the effect of compression on the drug-polymer demixing. In chapter 5 the drug-polymer mixing across different locations of laboratory spray dryers (ProCepT <b>Micro-spray</b> dryer and Buchi mini spray dryer B 191) was investigated for various compositions of NAP &# 822; PVP-VA 64 and miconazole &# 822; PVP-VA 64 amorphous and partially crystalline solid dispersions. Surprisingly the drug-polymer mixing with solid dispersions varied across spray dryers. The solid dispersion with high NAP loading (50 % (w/w)) showed differences in percent crystallinity of the drug for samples collected from different locations which increased with physical aging below the Tg. Both the PXRD diffuse diffraction patterns and vibrational spectroscopic data showed differences which may arise from dissimilarities in drug-polymer mixing and level of interactions in NAP &# 822; PVP-VA solid dispersions collected from different locations with spray dryers. The influence of compression was investigated for NAP/PVP-VA 64 solid dispersions collected from a single location which is covered in chapter 6. The glass transition width of the ASD was intact with compression without noticeable changes. However, a slight difference in PXRD diffuse halo diffraction pattern was observed among the compressed and uncompressed samples. The drug-polymer interaction was enhanced after compression for metastable NAP/PVP-VA amorphous solid dispersions (30 % (w/w) drug loading) as revealed by FTIR which was manifested as lesser crystallinity compared to the uncompressed solid dispersions during storage. Compression led to amorphous-amorphous phase separation of NAP/PVP amorphous solid dispersion. On the contrary compression showed no clear change in drug-polymer mixing in NAP/PVP-VA ASD where the physical stability was improved for the compressed solid dispersion of NAP/PVP-VA. To understand further the role of deformation on drug-polymer interactions, we described in chapter 7 how DRS was used to probe molecular dynamics of pure PVP-VA before and after compression which will be a preliminary study to investigate the role of compression induced alterations in localised bond motions and segmental mobility with respect to drug-polymer interactions. PVP-VA showed predominant plastic deformation during tableting with low yield pressure, comparable to the most popular plastically deforming polymers used in pharmaceutical applications (e. g. MCC). Compression of PVP-VA appeared to lead to a shorter time scale for the secondary (ß) relaxation process and synchronous shift in relaxation peaks of both the localised bond motion and the segmental mobility. A similar secondary relaxation process was also observed for PVP which may indicate the source of the relaxation peak could be conformational transitions in the vinyl pyrrolidone moiety of PVP-VA. An additional wing was also identified for compressed PVP-VA with the primary relaxation peak with a mean relaxation time smaller than the powder and the slightly compressed PVP-VA. It likely suggests that compression induced heterogeneity in the segmental dynamics and also reduced the time scale of the relaxation process. The diffuse PXRD pattern of PVP-VA was markedly altered by compression as a result of a disparity in molecular packing. This study indicates that local bonds of PVP-VA involved in intermolecular interaction with NAP in the ASD can be significantly affected by compression. The general discussion with literature examples and the future perspective of the project are described in chapter 8. nrpages: 166 status: publishe...|$|E
