2500|$|The {{history of}} {{sustainability}} traces human-dominated ecological systems {{from the earliest}} civilizations to the present. This history {{is characterized by the}} increased regional success of a particular society, followed by crises that were either resolved, producing sustainability, or not, leading to decline. Civilizations similarly thought to have eventually fallen because of poor <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> include the Mayans, Anasazi and Easter Islanders, among many others. In contrast, stable communities of shifting cultivators and horticulturists existed in New Guinea and South America, and large agrarian communities in China, India and elsewhere have farmed in the same localities for centuries. Some Polynesian cultures have maintained stable communities for between 1,000 and 3,000 years on small islands with minimal resources using rahui and kaitiakitanga to control human pressure on the environment. In Sri Lanka [...] nature reserves [...] established during the reign of king Devanampiyatissa and dating back to 307 BC were devoted to sustainability and harmonious living with nature.|$|E
2500|$|Xeer {{is defined}} by a few {{fundamental}} tenets that are immutable and which closely approximate the principle of jus cogens in international law: payment of blood money (locally referred to as diya or mag), assuring good inter-clan relations by treating women justly, negotiating with [...] "peace emissaries" [...] in good faith, and sparing the lives of socially protected groups (e.g. children, women, the pious, poets and guests), family obligations such as the payment of dowry, and sanctions for eloping, rules pertaining to the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> {{such as the use}} of pasture land, water, and other natural resources, providing financial support to married female relatives and newlyweds, donating livestock and other assets to the poor. The Xeer legal system also requires a certain amount of specialization of different functions within the legal framework. Thus, one can find odayal (judges), xeer boggeyaal (jurists), guurtiyaal (detectives), garxajiyaal (attorneys), murkhaatiyal (witnesses) and waranle (police officers) to enforce the law.|$|E

2500|$|Halleck's {{department}} {{performed well}} in early 1862, driving the Confederates {{from the state}} of Missouri and advancing into Arkansas. They held all of West Tennessee and half of Middle Tennessee. Grant, not yet aware of the political maneuvering behind his back, regarded Halleck as [...] "one of the greatest men of the age" [...] and Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman described him as the [...] "directing genius" [...] of the events that had given the Union cause such a [...] "tremendous lift" [...] in the previous months. This performance can be attributed to Halleck's strategy, administrative skills, and his good <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources,</b> and to the excellent execution by his subordinatesGrant, Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis at Pea Ridge, and Maj. Gen. John Pope at Island Number 10. Military historians disagree about Halleck's personal role in providing these victories. Some offer him the credit based on his overall command of the department; others, particularly those viewing his career through the lens of later events, believe that his subordinates were the primary factor.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} key {{differences}} in <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> {{in the global}} commons {{from those of the}} commons, in general. There are obvious differences in scale of both the resources and the number of users at the local versus the global level. [...] Also, there are differences in the shared culture and expectations of resource users; more localized commons users tend to be more homogeneous and global users more heterogeneous. This contributes to differences in the possibility and time it takes for new learning about resource usage to occur at the different levels. Moreover, global resource pools {{are less likely to be}} relatively stable and the dynamics are less easily understood. Many of the global commons are non-renewable on human time scales. Thus, resource degradation is more likely to be the result of unintended consequences that are unforeseen, not immediately observable, or not easily understood. For example, the carbon dioxide emissions that drive climate change continue to do so for at least a millennium after they enter the atmosphere and species extinctions last forever. [...] Importantly, because there are significant differences in the benefits, costs, and interests at the global level, there are significant differences in externalities between more local resource uses and uses of global-level resources.|$|E

The theoretical part introduce the fundamental terms connected with the strategic <b>management</b> <b>of</b> human <b>resources</b> from different perspectives, and the methods <b>of</b> strategic <b>management</b> <b>of</b> human <b>resources</b> in school institution. The empirical research reveals and compares the strategic <b>management</b> <b>of</b> human <b>resources</b> in kindergarten and kindergarten with remoted institutions. Further, the empirical research <b>of</b> strategic <b>management</b> {{is focused on}} the size of kindergarten in terms of number of classes. Two research methods were chosen: questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The semi-structured interviews were added due to obtaining of more specified and detailed information concerning given topic. Based on the results, it may be stated that the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> kindergarten and kindergarten with remoted institutions is strategic as regards human resources. However, the management differs one from another. The most important condition, affecting the strategic <b>management</b> <b>of</b> human <b>resources,</b> is the number of classes in the kindergartens...|$|R
