25|$|Henry Ernest Atkins (20 August 1872 – 31 January 1955) was a British chess master who is {{best known}} for his unparalleled record of winning the British Chess Championship nine times in eleven attempts. He won every year from 1905 to 1911, and again in 1924 and 1925. A schoolmaster, Atkins treated chess as a hobby, devoting {{relatively}} little time to it and playing in only a handful of international tournaments. He was an extremely gifted player who would likely have become one of the world's leading players had he pursued the game more single-mindedly. FIDE, the World Chess Federation, awarded him the International <b>Master</b> <b>title</b> in 1950 in recognition of his past achievements.|$|E
25|$|He {{represented}} Cambridge University in the Varsity chess matches of 1929, 1930, 1931 and 1932 (he {{studied at}} King's College, Cambridge). He was twice a {{winner of the}} British Chess Championship, in 1938 and 1956. He represented England in the Chess Olympiad six times, in 1933, 1935, 1937, 1939, 1954 and 1958. At the 1939 Olympiad in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Alexander had to leave part-way through the event, {{along with the rest}} of the English team, because of the declaration of World War II, since he was required at home for codebreaking duties. He was also the non-playing captain of England from 1964 to 1970. He was awarded the International <b>Master</b> <b>title</b> in 1950 and the International Master for Correspondence Chess title in 1970. He won Hastings 1946/47 with the score 7½/9, a point ahead of Savielly Tartakower. His best tournament result may have been first equal (with David Bronstein) at Hastings 1953/54, where he went undefeated and beat Soviet grandmasters David Bronstein and Alexander Tolush in individual games. Alexander's opportunities to appear abroad were limited as he was not allowed to play chess in the Soviet bloc because of his secret work in cryptography. He was also the chess columnist of The Sunday Times in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Lasker shot {{up through}} the chess rankings in 1889, {{when he won the}} Café Kaiserhof's annual Winter tournament 1888/89 and the Hauptturnier A ("second division" [...] tournament) at the sixth DSBCongress (German Chess Federation's congress) held in Breslau. Winning the Hauptturnier earned Lasker the title of [...] "master". [...] The {{candidates}} were divided into two groups of ten. The top four in each group competed in a final. Lasker won his section, with 2½ points more than his nearest rival. However, scores were reset to 0 for the final. With two rounds to go, Lasker trailed the leader, Viennese amateur von Feierfeil, by 1½ points. Lasker won both of his final games, while von Feierfeil lost in the penultimate round (being mated in 121 moves after the position was reconstructed incorrectly following an adjournment) and drew in the last round. The two players were now tied. Lasker won a playoff and garnered the <b>master</b> <b>title.</b> This enabled him to play in master-level tournaments and thus launched his chess career.|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{specific}} notation {{of the discipline}} in which the doctorate is obtained. Exceptions only exist for the disciplines with specific master titles of engineering [...] "ir." [...] ("ingenieur", i.e. Engineer) and law [...] "mr." [...] ("meester", i.e. Master of Law) where the title dr. {{is added to the}} original <b>master</b> <b>title.</b> For these disciplines, the original master's degree abbreviation is combined with the dr. abbreviation thus resulting in for example [...] "dr. ir. Familyman". The dr. title is always placed in front of the ir. title. In the case of a PhD in law, the original mr. title is placed before the dr. title (mr. dr., see e.g. Jan Peter Balkenende). For a person having a law master's degree, but holding a PhD in another field than law the mr. title is placed after the dr. title (dr. mr.). No specific notation or title for the medical disciplines exists in the Netherlands. Although a physician is usually referred to as [...] "dokter" [...] (note the spelling difference) this does not necessarily imply the physician holds a doctoral degree; nor does it give the physician a title equivalent to that of PhD.|$|E
