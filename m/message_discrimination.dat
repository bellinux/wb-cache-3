40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} college students ' AIDS communication and explore the relationships between AIDS communication, involvement, and sexual behavior. A non-random sample of 334 college students was surveyed. AIDS <b>message</b> <b>discrimination</b> and multiple indicators of involvement were tested for associations with sexual behavior change. The cognitive, behavioral and communication involvement dimensions were moderately correlated with sexual behavior in both single and multiple sex partner subsamples. Affective involvement did not emerge as a significant predictor of sexual behavior change. Prevalence <b>message</b> <b>discrimination</b> was also moderately associated with sexual behavior change in the single sex partner group; personal consequences <b>message</b> <b>discrimination</b> was correlated with sexual behavior change in the multiple partner group. The findings generally support the elaboration likelihood model and suggest that achieving heightened issue involvement through AIDS communication is an important intermediate step toward modifying sexual behavior.

40|$|An {{emerging}} {{consensus is}} that investigations of media effects {{should focus on the}} most basic political function of the media. Attempting {{to move out of the}} usual codes of conceptualization and analysis, this paper concentrates on three major points: the reconceptualization of political knowledge to encompass the respondent's subjective interpretation of certain essential elements of any political problem [...] actors, proposals, and actor-proposal linkages; the reconceptualization of media use to take into account the messages discriminated by a respondent about a particular content area as opposed to the sheer exposure to media whether content laden or not; and the development of a methodology that allows the respondent to define problems which are within his or her realm of personal experience rather than that set a priori by the investigator. An important feature of this methodology, employed in the Toledo Political Affairs Study, is its applicability across a vide variety of topic areas. This study, which is described in detail, points up the need for content analysis of the mass media agenda in studies employing measures f. <b>message</b> <b>discrimination.</b> (HOD...|$|E
40|$|Standard {{conceptions of}} mass media {{exposure}} do not capture empirical mass communicators. Media effects research is thus left without social agents on which to pin theories of causal force. The dimensions of content, medium, time, and individual cognition are reviewed in chapters 2 through 7. Content poses numerous problems, whether the approach be content analysis, structuralist message systems analysis or the <b>message</b> <b>discrimination</b> technique. The medium's empirical meanings are operationally impoverished. Cognition's explosive conceptual growth is regarded as pathological: Mass communication involves at least two classes of agents in interrelation. If one class is missing, the other must do double duty. Only individual time, discussed mostly by retracing Hirsch's critique of cultivation research, emerges as promising. Commodity relations, a three-category theoretical taxonomy, is introduced as a bridge to the social and is operationally defined with individual time, media devices, and knowledge of how financial arrangements structure temporal flows of content into aggregate households. Categorical differences in how media organizations standing within these relations would handle feedback from households are used to define distinct knowledge effects to explore with surveys. Three research designs with the knowledge gap and mass political belief systems are offered in the final chapter...|$|E

Its appeal lay in the sensitivity of its lyrics in juxtaposing an awareness of a world in conflict with a personal expression of the need for love.Sung in Mayfield's gentle, suave vocal style, the lyrics were a combination of a romantic love ballad and a social <b>message</b> against <b>discrimination.</b>|$|R

In Cambodian society, same-sex love or relationships are frowned upon and such acts are viewed as shameful and degrading for the family image or reputation.

40|$|Quantum {{detectors}} {{provide information}} about quantum systems by establishing correlations between certain properties of those systems {{and a set of}} macroscopically distinct states of the corresponding measurement devices. A natural question of fundamental significance is how much information a quantum detector can extract from the quantum system it is applied to. In the present paper we address this question within a precise framework: given a quantum detector implementing a specific generalized quantum measurement, what is the optimal performance achievable with it for a concrete information readout task, and what is the optimal way to encode information in the quantum system in order to achieve this performance? We consider some of the most common information transmission tasks - the Bayes cost problem (of which minimal error discrimination is a special case), unambiguous <b>message</b> <b>discrimination,</b> and the maximal mutual information. We provide general solutions to the Bayesian and unambiguous discrimination problems. We also show that the maximal mutual information has an interpretation of a capacity of the measurement, and derive various properties that it satisfies, including its relation to the accessible information of an ensemble of states, and its form {{in the case of a}} group-covariant measurement. We illustrate our results with the example of a noisy two-level symmetric informationally complete measurement, for whose capacity we give analytical proofs of optimality. The framework presented here provides a natural way to characterize generalized quantum measurements in terms of their information readout capabilities.

Churches had longed played ethnic politics themselves, favoring the Tutsi during the colonial period then switching allegiance to the Hutu after 1959, sending a <b>message</b> that ethnic <b>discrimination</b> was consistent with church teaching. The church leaders had close ties with the political leaders, and after the genocide began, the church leaders called on the population to support the new interim government, the very government supporting the genocide.|$|R
40|$|Recently, social {{scientists}} {{have become increasingly}} interested {{in the nature of}} communi-cations from parents to children regarding ethnicity and race. Termed racial socialization, race-related messages to children may have important consequences for children’s identity development and well-being. This study examined the frequency and correlates of two di-mensions of racial socialization—messages about ethnic pride, history, and heritage (Cultural Socialization) and <b>messages</b> about <b>discrimination</b> and racial bias (Preparation for Bias) — among 273 urban African American, Puerto Rican, and Dominican parents. Parents reported more frequent Cultural Socialization than Preparation for Bias. There were no significant eth-nic group differences in the frequency of Cultural Socialization. However, African American parents reported more frequent Preparation for Bias than did Dominican parents who, in turn, reported more frequent messages of this sort than did Puerto Rican parents. Ethnic identity was a stronger predictor of Cultural Socialization among Puerto Rican and Dominican par-ents than among their African American counterparts. In contrast, perceived discrimination experiences was a stronger predictor of Preparation for Bias among African American and Dominican parents than among Puerto Rican parents. Finally, race-related phenomenon ac-counted for more variance in both Cultural Socialization and Preparation for Bias among parents reporting on their behaviors with children 10 – 17 years old as compared to parents reporting on their behaviors with children 6 – 9 years old.

40|$|This {{research}} paper aims to know discrimination against Ahmadiyah {{of the major}} character reflected in The Outcast novel. The objective of the research is to analyze Okky Madasari’s The Outcast novel based on the structural elements of the novel and to analyze the religious conflicts by using sociological theory. The type {{of this research is}} descriptive qualitative. The data of the research is the primary data of the research is The Outcast novel by Okky Madasari. The secondary data of the research taken from any information related to the novel such as books, other source and website that related to the study. The technique of collecting data are reading novel, taking important note from primary and secondary data, arranging the data into several part based on its classification, selecting the data by rejecting the irrelevant information which does not support the topic of the study, and drawing the conclusion. The method to analyze of this data is descriptive analysis. Based on structural elements of the novel, the writer delivers a moral <b>message</b> that “The <b>discrimination</b> can be caused by the lack of knowledge”. The result of this analysis is that the discrimination against Ahmadiyah in the novel appears in a form of direct and indirect discrimination. The first discrimination appears in the middle of Ahmadi community it self, where the Ahmadi can not make relationship with outsider. Not only in her family of Ahmadi, has Alam’s parent also considered their decision related with the rule of their faith...|$|R
40|$|The {{organized}} {{opponents of}} legal and social equality for gays and lesbians, particularly the foes of marriage for same-sex couples, have coalesced in recent years around the rallying cry of 2 ̆ 2 religious liberty. 2 ̆ 2 In 2015, the conflict between LGBT rights and religious liberty intensified as legislators in seventeen states considered adopting Religious Freedom Restoration Acts (RFRAs). Most of the national attention focused on Indiana, where legislators adopted a RFRA under pressure from religious conservatives, only to later amend it under pressure from business and civic leaders over concerns that the law sent a <b>message</b> endorsing anti-gay <b>discrimination.</b> RFRAs, which typically require strict scrutiny when a religious adherent claims that a government law or policy imposes a substantial burden on the adherent 2 ̆ 7 s exercise of religion, {{have been around for}} more than twenty years. But they became a battlefront in the culture wars only recently, as the came to be regarded as a form of backlash against the legal and political advancements of gays and lesbians. RFRAs became a vehicle for dissent for religious conservatives against lower court rulings that were bringing same-sex civil marriage to states (like Indiana) that had long and tenaciously resisted it. Religious conservative activists said RFRAs were necessary so that store owners, landlords, and employers who oppose legal equality for gays and lesbians could seek religious accommodations from laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. Disagreement over whether or when such accommodations are appropriate pretty much sums up the current RFRA debate in a nutshell...|$|R
