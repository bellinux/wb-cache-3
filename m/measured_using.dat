5|$|Two {{different}} {{measures are}} used for storm tide and storm surge measurements. Storm tide is <b>measured</b> <b>using</b> a geodetic vertical datum (NGVD 29 or NAVD 88). Since storm surge {{is defined as the}} rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement caused by tides, storm surge is <b>measured</b> <b>using</b> tidal predictions, with the assumption that the tide prediction is well-known and only slowly varying in the region subject to the surge. Since tides are a localized phenomenon, storm surge can only be measured in relationship to a nearby tidal station. Tidal bench mark information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic vertical datum to mean sea level (MSL) at that location, then subtracting the tidal prediction yields a surge height above the normal water height.|$|E

50|$|For many {{cultured pearl}} dealers and wholesalers, the {{preferred}} weight <b>measure</b> <b>used</b> for loose pearls and pearl strands is the momme. Momme is a weight <b>measure</b> <b>used</b> by the Japanese for centuries. Today, momme weight {{is still the}} standard unit of <b>measure</b> <b>used</b> by most pearl dealers to communicate with pearl producers and wholesalers. One momme corresponds to 1/1000 kan. Reluctant to give up tradition, the Japanese government formalized the kan measure in 1891 as being exactly 3.75 kilograms or 8.28 pounds. Hence, 1 momme = 3.75 grams or 3750 milligrams.|$|R
5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually <b>measured</b> <b>using</b> a theodolite or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E
5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be <b>measured</b> <b>using</b> optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be <b>measured</b> <b>using</b> a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} {{were conducted by}} a team of British, Spanish, French, Swiss and American astronomers using the photometer on the James Gregory Telescope in Scotland; using visual comparisons to the nearby bright star HD 80408, the star's light curve was better defined. In combination with measurements of WASP-13's spectrum <b>measured</b> <b>using</b> the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in France, the star's radial velocity was also discovered. The Fibre-Fed Echelle Spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope gathered additional measurements of WASP-13's spectrum, allowing astronomers to determine WASP-13's characteristics. Use of SOPHIE's data led to the discovery of the planet WASP-13b in 2008; the planet was reported in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{electron}} {{is by far}} {{the least}} massive of these particles at , with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be <b>measured</b> <b>using</b> available techniques. It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details.|$|E

5|$|The {{experimental}} determination of pKa values is commonly performed {{by means of}} titrations, in a medium of high ionic strength and at constant temperature. A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound in the medium is acidified with a strong acid {{to the point where}} the compound is fully protonated. The solution is then titrated with a strong base until all the protons have been removed. At each point in the titration pH is <b>measured</b> <b>using</b> a glass electrode and a pH meter. The equilibrium constants are found by fitting calculated pH values to the observed values, using the method of least squares.|$|E
