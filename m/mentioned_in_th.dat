40|$|The {{concept of}} health {{is a social}} {{construction}} defi-ned by the historical-cultural contexts of societies. At the moment, this context is characterized by global challenges such as climate change, energy crisis, the north-south divide, and poverty, among others. In view of these challenges, sustainable development {{has emerged as a}} proposal to cope with these drawbacks of the Western development model. In this sense, it is plausible to suppose, in accordance with a new global scenario of sustaina-ble development, that a new conception of health is also emerging. For that reason, this paper aims at identifying this renewed concept of health, together with related concepts which are <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>th...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new ant-based method that {{takes advantage of the}} cooperative self-organization of Ant Colony Systems to create a naturally inspired clustering and pattern recognition method. The approach considers each data item as an ant, which moves inside a grid changing the cells it goes through, in a fashion similar to Kohonen’s Self-Organizing Maps. The resulting algorithm is conceptually more simple, takes less free parameters than other ant-based clustering al-gorithms, and, after some parameter tuning, yields very good results on some benchmark problems. Introduction and State of the Art Clustering is performed naturally by some types of ants at least in two different ways.

Method: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study that was performed in June 2010. The sample population that was studied consisted of all of the workers and other personnel (130 people) at ZardjinBaft Workshop in Ilam, Iran.

Under appropriate circumstances, voluntary ingestion of sweetened alcohol by appropriate strains is shown to raise rate of mortality and to induce liver pathology similar to that found in some types or stages of human alcoholism.

DSMAs are the unilateral NAMAs whose finance and implementation are supported by the government of the country. The countermeasures of DSMAs generally are of low investment costs and can be implemented by domestic efforts, such as energy management and energy efficiency improvement. Furthermore, DSMAs will be domestically measured, reported, and verified (MRV). On the other hand, ISMAs are the mitigation actions seeking international support in order to facilitate matching of finance, advanced technology, and capacity building. ISMAs mostly are the actions that require high investment cost and advanced technology.|$|R

By so doing, one would look differently at the known data concerning the Church of St. Nicholas, the construction of which was commissioned by the Split lady Nemira Mesagalina, <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> a note following a document dated 1069, as well as on the Church of St. Nicholas de Collegaci, <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> an entry dated 1119. By following this consideration, the authoress maintains that the above-mentioned Split churches dedicated to St. Nicholas might be identified with the St. Nicholas Church in the suburb of Split called Veli Varoš. It has been concluded that the church in question was commissioned by Johannes, Mesagalina’s son, most probably in the last decade of the 11 th century. After his death, the construction was continued by his sister, the Benedictine nun Nemira Mesagalina, perhaps in cooperation with »Dra (go, or Dragovit) Mesagalina filius« whose name appeares as a witness in 1111, and who was her brother. It could also have been »Rado, a son of the donator«.

40|$|Ever since Antoine Galland {{published}} Les Mille et une nuits in 1704, {{the story}} of Sheherezade and her spellbinding narrative powers has inspired immensely diverse adaptations in the West, from Disney's Aladdin to Pier Pasolini's Il Fiore delle mille e una notte, a soft-core porno with Oriental conceits. There have been bowdlerized versions fit for bedtime stories and other, bawdier versions, like Sir Richard Burton's Arabian Nights, passed around by randy schoolboys. Although many classics have undergone profound metamorphoses over time, nothing compares to the variety of the Nights. The irony is that a narrative underscored by a theme of matrimonial fidelity has produced {{some of the most}} faithless translations that we have today. But is fidelity a moot point when the source text is itself a translation, transcription, and transmogrification? Since there is no one definitive source for the Nights, doesn't that make it fair game for a translator's whimsy? There is not just one manuscript of the Nights, but four; and the Breslau, Calcutta I, Calcutta II, and Bulaq editions resemble one another, but, like independent-minded quadruplets, do not always agree. To complicate matters even more, these manuscripts are most likely translations from the Persian Hazar Afsana (A Thousand Stories), an ancient text that is now lost but gets <b>mention</b> <b>in</b> 10 <b>th</b> century annals of Arabic literature. And since many of the tales appear to be Indian in origin, some scholars of the Nights posit that the Hazar Afsana was itself a translation from various Indian sources.
