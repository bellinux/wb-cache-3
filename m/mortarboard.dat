25|$|Cap - For {{undergraduate}} and masters degrees a <b>mortarboard</b> is worn. Unlike most academic caps, which are square in shape, the Indonesian cap is usually pentagonal. Another type of cap like Tudor bonnet is generally worn by doctoral students, although in some universities like Padjadjaran Univeristy the bonnet is worn for all academic degrees.|$|E
25|$|With their festal gowns, Doctors of Divinity wear a {{black velvet}} cap, and Doctors in other Faculties wear a wide-brimmed round velvet bonnet with gold string and tassels, {{known as a}} Tudor bonnet, instead of a <b>mortarboard,</b> though they may choose to wear a square cap with a festal gown if they are {{taking part in a}} {{ceremony}} in the Senate House.|$|E
50|$|Gown and hoods {{are worn}} for graduations, but <b>mortarboards,</b> while officially {{part of the}} {{academic}} dress of the University, are not. When in full dress, Doctors wear soft square hats (known as John Knox caps) with a tump at {{the centre of the}} crown rather than <b>mortarboards</b> or Tudor bonnets.|$|R

25|$|Elementary {{and high}} school {{students}} also wear a certain kind of academic dress upon their graduation, usually a white gown and <b>mortarboard</b> for public schools. For private schools, the gown and mortarboard's color is at the discretion of the administration. There are several schools which make use of a hood-like design on top of their gowns which bears the school colors.|$|E
25|$|The {{academic}} cap or square, {{commonly known}} as the <b>mortarboard,</b> has come to be symbolic of academia. In some universities it can be worn by graduates and undergraduates alike. It is a flat square hat with a tassel suspended from a button in the top center of the board. Properly worn, the cap is parallel to the ground, though some people, especially women, wear it angled back.|$|E
25|$|In many universities, {{holders of}} doctorates wear a soft rounded {{headpiece}} {{known as a}} Tudor bonnet or tam, rather than a trencher. Other types of hats used, especially in some universities in the UK, are the John Knox cap (mostly at Scottish universities), the Bishop Andrewes cap (a reinvention of the ancient form of the <b>mortarboard,</b> worn by Cambridge DDs) and the pileus (at Sussex). In some universities, such as Oxford, women may wear an Oxford ladies' cap.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, <b>mortarboards</b> were often worn by schoolteachers, and the hat remains an icon of the {{teaching}} profession.|$|R
25|$|However, this {{academic}} {{dress is}} only {{used for the}} opening of the academic year and for PhD graduations or for doctorates honoris causa. It is worn only by doctors, deans and the University Rector. For other graduates, the academic dress is often composed by a <b>mortarboard</b> and a mozzetta (muceta) or a sash over the shoulder (beca) with the shield of the University and/or Faculty. The colour of the mozzetta or the sash depends on the academic field.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mortarboard</b> {{may also}} be {{referred}} to as a trencher cap (or simply trencher). The tassel comprises a cluster of silk threads which are fixed together and fastened by a button at one end, and fixed at the centre of the headpiece. The loose strands are allowed to fall freely over the board edge, typically falling over the left front side of the cap. Often the strands are plaited together to form a cord with the end threads left untied.|$|E
25|$|As {{is common}} {{throughout}} the United States, Sylvan Hills students participate in annual events and school dances {{such as the}} annual homecoming football game and dance, a Sadie Hawkins dance, a Powderpuff flag football game, the Miss Sylvan Hills pageant, the selection of Top 10 seniors (as selected by staff) and the year-end prom before graduation. For the graduation ceremonies, graduates typically wear academic regalia including blue gowns with blue <b>mortarboard</b> caps and blue-and-white tassels. Honor graduates wear a gold honor cord, students in the top 10% academically wear white gowns, with National Honor Society members wearing gold stoles, Beta Club members with gold tassel, Mu Alpha Theta members with blue cord, and Quill & Scroll members with blue and gold cord.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mortarboards</b> worn for bachelor's and master's degrees {{are also}} {{presently}} made from black synthetic fiber. The Tudor bonnets or tams of the Ph.D.s are in black velvet with their oblong-shaped brim appropriately hard-backed.|$|R
50|$|Students gaining {{degrees from}} Bristol (apart from honorary graduates) {{are in the}} select group of British {{students}} who do not wear <b>mortarboards</b> at graduation. According to legend, this is because, at an early graduation ceremony, the male graduands all threw their headgear either at the female graduands, or off the Clifton Suspension Bridge, by way of 'protest' at coeducation. Subsequently, <b>mortarboards</b> were not worn. This legend is told of a number of other universities and is almost certainly untrue, particularly given that University College Bristol was coeducational before the University proper even existed and that the Clifton suspension bridge is about 1.5 miles away (2.4 km).|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1912, however, {{uniformity}} was challenged. Brown adopted <b>mortarboards</b> for its trustees and fellows {{in the university}} color, seal brown. In 1938 Yale began using Yale blue gowns for its masters’ and doctors’ academic dress.|$|R
25|$|The University of East Anglia is infamous for two new hats {{designed}} by Cecil Beaton that were prescribed. One {{is known as}} the 'Dan Dare' or 'Mickey Mouse' cap which is a skull cap with a narrow rim around the top for bachelors; the other was known as the tricorn or upside-down iron, which was basically a <b>mortarboard</b> but with a triangle instead of a square for the top board for masters. These caps were unpopular with students who preferred the square cap and they soon fell into disuse. The tricorn is still used as the official hat of the Registrar and the Dan Dare is still officially prescribed for undergraduates; however, because undergraduate gowns are extremely rarely, if ever, worn pressure for abolition of the cap has not occurred.|$|E
25|$|The hood, {{like the}} gown, is {{identical}} {{to that of the}} hood for the Cambridge Master of Arts. A Bachelor's degree hood is lined with coloured satin and bordered with white fur (the exception to this are Canterbury and Waikato University which do not line their hoods with fur). The bachelor's degree with Honours hood is lined with coloured satin and bordered with white satin. The master's degree hood has no edging. A doctoral degree recipient wears the same as a graduate receiving a Masters, except the gown is completely silk, either black or scarlet, with the option to wear a cloth gown. A Doctoral hood is completely silk and the headdress is a black Tudor bonnet, in place of the flat-topped <b>mortarboard</b> worn with Bachelor's and Master's gowns.|$|E
25|$|Officers of the {{universities}} generally wear distinctive and more elaborate dress. The Chancellor and the Vice-Chancellor may wear a black damask lay type gown (sometimes with a long train) trimmed with gold or silver lace and frogs. They wear a velvet <b>mortarboard,</b> similarly trimmed with gold braid and tassel. This form of dress is not strictly 'academical' but it is typical dress for those in high positions. Other than this gown, they may have other distinct forms of dress, such as the scarlet cappa clausa or cope worn in certain circumstances by the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge or his/her deputy and by higher doctors presenting candidates for degrees, which was once worn by Doctors of Divinity. In the past, Chancellors may also wear full court dress with breeches and court shoes {{like that of the}} Lord Chancellor of Great Britain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mortarboards</b> {{are often}} seen in party supply shops in the United States in May and June, when they appear {{in the form of}} party decorations, on {{commemorative}} gifts such as teddy bears, and on congratulatory greeting cards.|$|R
50|$|Graduates of {{vocational}} {{schools and colleges}} usually wear togas and <b>mortarboards</b> or caps. These are usually black, except for those colleges and universities who have togas made in the school colors. Underneath, the graduates wear formal clothes which may range from “Sunday best” to party attire.|$|R
50|$|There are {{instances}} when male undergraduates {{are required to}} wear their <b>mortarboards</b> indoors. Undergraduates appearing before the Proctors' Court are required to present themselves wearing their caps and to salute the Proctors in the customary manner upon entering. They then remove their caps {{for the remainder of}} the proceedings.|$|R
25|$|Following reestablishment, the NaKUMA {{academic}} community {{has attempted to}} restore the traditions of its predecessor. However, during NaKUMA's reincarnation, several new traditions have been founded. Every year on 15 October the school celebrates Academy day and NaUKMA students wash the monument of the noted Kyiv-Mohyla alumnus philosopher Hryhorii Skovoroda. This action is called clean Skovoroda. The monument of Skovoroda {{in front of the}} university is also decorated with a <b>mortarboard</b> during the annual graduation ceremony held on 28 June. Another tradition during the ceremony is to carry the university turtle named Alma around the new graduates who make wishes while touching her shell. A student tradition connecting the old Kyiv-Mohyla Academy and NaUKMA is theatrical performances called verteps. Verteps possibly were introduced by the students of the old Academy. They are performed during different festive events. Lastly, it is a tradition to open each academic year with a welcome event for the new students, followed by a lecture by a renowned scientist, who is given an honorary professorship at the University. The ceremony of new NaUKMA student initiation includes taking a traditional student oath. During the first term at NaUKMA, students of all faculties introduce themselves to the {{academic community}} during the acquaintance ball.|$|E
25|$|Early {{students}} wore a <b>mortarboard</b> or trencher, {{although this}} had been discontinued by 1871. In 1876, a straw boater with ribbon of broad diagonal stripes {{of black and white}} was introduced. The black and white stripes led to the boys being nicknamed magpies. A metal cap badge was being worn by 1883, and it was around this time that the black and gold colours were first associated with the college. Under the headmastership of R.H. Chambers (1881–1892) the chocolate and white colour scheme was introduced, along with differences in uniform between the junior and senior schools. Juniors wore a chocolate-coloured pillbox hat with a white Maltese cross on the front; seniors wore a chocolate-coloured cap with the coat of arms of Jersey in white. The tails on the heraldic leopards in this badge were so long that the boys were nicknamed College congers as a result. In 1893, black and gold replaced chocolate and white, and straw boaters were black and white with a ribbon of black-gold-black. The coat of arms of Jersey on the badge was depicted as black leopards on gold. These designs lasted until 1927, when chocolate and white made a return under headmaster A.H. Worrall in the form of caps with concentric rings of black, white and chocolate. At the same time, the four house colours appeared as backings to the badge on boys' caps according to their respective houses. Until the Second World War boarders had a maroon cap with blue ribbon. Under conditions of military occupation, clothing was scarce. In 1945 a navy blue cap was adopted as a temporary measure, and in 1947 a chocolate cap with radiating piping of black and white was chosen from a range of options; worn with a blazer of royal blue, gold and crimson. In 1952 black and gold made a definitive return: a black cap with radiating piping and a badge, both gold; a black blazer with gold badge on the pocket. Chocolate and white were retained as sports colours.|$|E
500|$|There was {{discussion}} about the [...] "Indians" [...] name at El Reno High School, El Reno, Oklahoma when a Native American student {{was not allowed to}} wear a beaded <b>mortarboard</b> at graduation. The result was the signing of a Spirit Charter with the Cheyenne & Arapaho Tribes to retain the name while agreeing to avoid any derogatory or disrespectful Native American references, including the wearing of Native American regalia by non-natives.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{traditional}} costumes are derivatives of the costumes worn in early rural France during the same celebration. The costumes directly mock the nobility, the clergy and the educated; celebrants wear miter hats, <b>mortarboards</b> and capuchons, which were initially designed to mock the tall pointy hats worn by noble women.|$|R

50|$|At a University of Manchester {{graduation}} ceremony the graduands wear the academic dress {{appropriate to the}} qualification {{they are about to}} be awarded. <b>Mortarboards</b> or Tudor bonnets are worn at the finish of the ceremony and in procession, but held in the hand otherwise.

[...] "Bottles of paint, turpentine and tequila surround an artist {{lying on his back}} atop scaffolding. It is the spring of 1944 and American GIs are overseas fighting the axis powers. The artist strokes his brush on the wall about two stories tall and 15 feet wide until a mural begins to emerge. Night after night, the painter pieces together his puzzle.
