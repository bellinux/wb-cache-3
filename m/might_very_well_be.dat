5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E
500|$|He {{worked on}} a 2006 {{one-shot}} called Cross Epoch, in cooperation with One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda. The story is a short crossover that presents characters from both Dragon Ball and One Piece. Toriyama was the character designer and artist for the 2006 Mistwalker Xbox 360 exclusive RPG Blue Dragon, working with Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu, both of whom he had previously worked with on Chrono Trigger. He announced that his help with {{the making of the}} Blue Dragon anime <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> his final work in anime. In his own words, he said: ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{point of}} {{contention}} concerns precisely how, and by what means, the individual was beaten. In his 1920 essay [...] "The Lex Pompeia and the Poena Cullei", Max Radin observes that, as expiation, convicts were typically flogged until they bled (so some commentators translates the phrase to [...] "beaten with rods till he bleeds"), but that it <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> that the rods themselves were painted red. Radin also points to a third option, namely that the [...] "rods" [...] actually were some type of shrub, since it documented from other sources that whipping with some kinds of shrub {{was thought to be}} purifying in nature.|$|E

500|$|The {{power of}} expert systems {{came from the}} expert {{knowledge}} they contained. They {{were part of a}} new direction in AI research that had been gaining ground throughout the 70s. [...] "AI researchers were beginning to suspect—reluctantly, for it violated the scientific canon of parsimony—that intelligence <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> based on the ability to use large amounts of diverse knowledge in different ways," [...] writes Pamela McCorduck. [...] "he great lesson from the 1970s was that intelligent behavior depended very much on dealing with knowledge, sometimes quite detailed knowledge, of a domain where a given task lay". Knowledge based systems and knowledge engineering became a major focus of AI research in the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|Unanimous praise {{was given}} to lead singer Ariel's vocal work: Jeffries called her [...] "a mix of {{powerful}} and approachable that <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> {{the inspiration for the}} band’s tongue-in-cheek name"; Maxwell noted that [...] "what is most notable, and most commendable, about this album is the sheer force with which singer Ariel delivers her vocals"; and Schexnayder reported that her [...] "voice runs seamlessly through the tunes without ever going overboard like her fellow label mates in The Letter Black", calling her voice [...] "gifted" [...] {{and one of the reasons}} to be interested in the album.|$|E
2500|$|The play {{took more}} than a minute of {{real-time}} to conclude and analysts have said it is the longest or possibly the longest play in college football history. ESPN said the play took 62 seconds and reports may be the longest play in college football history. [...] The Frederick News Post said the play took 63 seconds and they also stated [...] "it <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> the longest play in college history." [...] NBC said [...] "If this wasn't the most memorable game-ending play in college football history, it likely was the longest play -- by a multiple of two -- in the game's history." [...] SouthernCollegeSports.com called it the longest play and commented [...] "Perhaps the most amazing thing about this longest play ever is the fact that not a single flag was thrown for a rules infraction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{felt at the}} time," [...] Mr. Raymond Greene went on eagerly, [...] "that {{there was}} {{something}} queer about the affair. Listen! I have been putting two and two together, {{and it seems to}} me that one of those men <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> have <b>been</b> this missing Mr. Romilly." ...|$|R
60|$|Some people now-a-days {{think that}} they would, and that they <b>might</b> have <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>been</b> what is called Monotheists, without believing all {{the story of the}} signs and wonders in Egypt, and the passage of the Red Sea, and the giving of the law to Moses.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] exclaimed Bernard, [...] "that's queer! We had a {{clerk in}} the bank who gave his name as Meriton, and who cut and ran the very day he heard that Sir Jasper Merrifield was coming out as Commandant. Yes, he was carroty. I rarely saw Wilfred at Clipstone, but this <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> have <b>been</b> the fellow, afraid to face his uncle." ...|$|R
2500|$|Like all pythons, the African rock python is nonvenomous {{and kills}} its prey by constriction. After {{gripping}} the prey, the snake coils around it, tightening its coils {{every time the}} victim breathes out. Death {{is thought to be}} caused by cardiac arrest rather than by asphyxiation or crushing. The African rock python feeds on a variety of large rodents, monkeys, warthogs, antelopes, fruit bats, monitor lizards, and even crocodiles in forest areas, and on rats, poultry, dogs, and goats in suburban areas. Occasionally, it may eat the cubs of big cats such as leopards, lions, and cheetahs, cubs of hyenas, and puppies of wild dogs such as jackals and Cape hunting dogs.. However, these encounters are very rare, as the adult cats can easily kill pythons or fend them off. In March 1, 2017, a 3.9-m (15-ft) African rock python was filmed eating an adult male spotted hyena weighing [...] This encounter suggests that the snake <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> capable of hunting and killing larger and more dangerous animals than previously thought.|$|E
2500|$|The Horsham chapel is a [...] "plain, cottage-like building" [...] {{which forms}} {{part of a}} group of old vernacular {{buildings}} on the west side of the Worthing Road—including Horsham's Quaker Friends Meeting House. [...] It has walls of red and blue-grey brick, two storeys and a hipped roof (with a hidden central depression) laid with Horsham Stone tiles. [...] The main façade faces east, and sits on a brickwork plinth with a stone course. [...] A similar band separates the lower and upper storeys. [...] The date of construction is etched in one of the casement windows. [...] The central porch dates from the late 19th century. [...] The rear (west) wall is obscured but retains its original ground-floor paired arched windows and first-floor gallery windows. [...] The north and south walls have single-window ranges; those on the south side are hidden behind the baptistery and vestry built in 1772. [...] These are in the form of a lean-to with a sloping tiled and gabled roof and an arched window. [...] Writing in 1914, one architect stated that [...] "to a casual glance, the chapel ... <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> a detached private house".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to stress waves, Bellamy and Zajtchuck describe shear waves {{as a possible}} mechanism of indirect injuries in the WDMET data. They estimate that 10% of bone fractures in the data {{may be the result}} of indirect injuries, that is, bones fractured by the bullet passing close to the bone without a direct impact. A Chinese experiment is cited which provides a formula estimating how pressure magnitude decreases with distance. Together with the difference between strength of human bones and strength of the animal bones in the Chinese experiment, Bellamy and Zajtchuck use this formula to estimate that assault rifle rounds [...] "passing within a centimeter of a long bone <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> capable of causing an indirect fracture." [...] (p.153) Bellamy and Zajtchuck suggest the fracture in Figures 4-46 and 4-47 is likely an indirect fracture of this type. Damage due to shear waves extends to even greater distances in abdominal injuries in the WDMET data. Bellamy and Zajtchuck write, [...] "The abdomen is one body region in which damage from indirect effects may be common." [...] (p.150) Injuries to the liver and bowel shown in Figures 4-42 and 4-43 are described, [...] "The damage shown in these examples extends far beyond the tissue that is likely to direct contact with the projectile." [...] (p.150) ...|$|E
60|$|Nick {{laughed out}} at this--it {{would be such}} fine news to some people. But it was uttered with perfect gravity, and it <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> have <b>been</b> {{in the spirit of}} that gravity that Nash failed to observe his {{agreement}} to sit again the next day. The next and the next and the next passed, but he never came back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] answers B. [...] "But {{then we must}} {{remember}} that the performance is not intended as an entertainment, but as a religious service.

6000|$|... "A {{very near}} case," [...] {{the doctor said}} critically; [...] "as close a shave as ever I saw. Had the wound on the face been {{a quarter of an}} inch nearer the eyebrow it would have severed the {{temporal}} artery. As it is it has merely laid open the jaw. Neither of the other wounds are serious, though they <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> have <b>been</b> fatal." ...|$|R

50|$|According to Shell the {{original}} door <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> have <b>been</b> {{the work of}} a slave called Rangton van Bali, who was captured on the island of Bali and sold into slavery in Jakarta to Jacob de Jong, a well known Cape slave trader.

5000|$|Zeuxis of Heraclea {{was one of}} Apollodorus' rivals {{according}} to Pliny. Zeuxis was tutored in the arts by Demophilus of Himera and Neseus of Thasos. At one point, Apollodorus even accused Zeuxis of stealing art techniques from others which <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> have <b>been</b> true because Zeuxis was also attributed with the expansion and development of Apollodorus' prized skiagraphia.
