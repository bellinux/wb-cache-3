40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{recent years}} the {{battlefield}} has undergone changes due to technological advances, not the least being the implementation of electronic command and control systems. These systems have been introduced {{in an effort to}} maintain pace with the tempo of operations and to reduce the fog of war. A key requirement of any command and control environment is the digitisation of the battlefield to provide the spatial awareness needed by commanders at all levels. Digitisation occurs in many forms, however in this case the term is restricted to the requirement to provide digital representations of terrain through the development of geographic information systems (GIS), and in particular the development of <b>military</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>information</b> (MGI) systems. The provision of digital geographic data can be cause for concern due to a variety of methods for producing it and for storing it. The provision of set formats as required by the Australian Defence Force (ADF) will of course guarantee the C 3 I requirements will be met, however, what of applications such as simulation technology. The development of simulation systems over the last ten years has revealed a variety of formats and the requirement for an alternate view of the digital world, the three-dimensional. The increasing popularity of simulation technology to fill the training void and to operate in concert with C 3 I systems is cause for concern as issues such as centralised management, conversion systems, formats, training and resolution are yet to be resolved...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A great {{convergence}} of cartography, secrecy, and power {{occurred during the}} Cold War. In the American case, a complex series of interactions between secret and classified programs and institutions and their publicly accessible counterparts accomplished both traditional and novel objectives of <b>military</b> <b>geographic</b> intelligence. This process also yielded the World Geodetic System, a masscentered “figure of the earth ” at accuracies adequate for warfare with intercontinental ballistic missiles. A structural and institutional separation developed between enterprises charged with overhead data acquisition systems, which were classified at increasingly high levels of secrecy, and those responsible for data reduction, analysis, and mapping systems, which remained largely unclassified and publicly accessible, in part to conceal the classified data acquisition systems. This structural separation destabilized photogrammetric mapping by displacing systems that privileged dimensional stability with systems that privileged novel sensor types more appropriate to Cold War geo-political objectives and constraints. Eventually, photogrammetric mapping systems were re-stabilized by successfully implementing analytical solutions imposed in digital mapping and data management systems. This achievement re-privileged dimensional stability, now redefined to the new media of geo-referenced digital data. In the early 1970 s these developments culminated in advanced research projects of <b>Military</b> <b>Geographic</b> Intelligence Systems (MGIS). Their deployment in the Vietnam War was both their apex and their undoing. In the aftermath, classified mapping and database systems diverged from civilian versions of MGIS, which became known as <b>Geographic</b> <b>Information</b> Systems (GIS) ...|$|R
