The 1st Guards Brigade, followed by other HV units, entered Vrginmost. The 110th and the 143rd Home Guard Regiments conducted <b>mopping</b> <b>up</b> operations around Vrginmost and Lasinja. The 137th Home Guard Regiment conducted <b>mopping</b> <b>up</b> {{operations in the}} Vojnić area and the 14th Home Guard Regiment did {{the same in the}} Slunj, Cetingrad, and Rakovica areas. The HV secured Dvor late in the evening, shortly after the civilians finished evacuating. Numerous HV Home Guard units were later tasked with further <b>mopping</b> <b>up</b> operations.|$|R
5|$|The {{extinction}} {{of the dinosaurs}} {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period is generally thought to have been caused by the Cretaceous–Paleogene impact event, which created the Chicxulub crater, demonstrating that impacts are a serious threat to life on Earth. Astronomers have speculated that without Jupiter to <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> potential impactors, extinction events might have been more frequent on Earth, and complex life might not have been able to develop. This is part of the argument used in the Rare Earth hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Shakshouka, {{originally}} a workman’s breakfast popularized by North African Jews in Israel, is made simply of fried eggs in spicy tomato sauce, with other vegetable ingredients or sausage optional. Shakshouka is typically {{served in the}} same frying pan {{in which it is}} cooked, with thick slices of white bread to <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the sauce, and a side of salad. Modern variations include a milder version made with spinach and feta without tomato sauce, and hot chili shakshouka, a version that includes both sweet and hot peppers and coriander.|$|E
5|$|Until 17 July, the VRS {{continued}} its attacks aimed at retaking territory lost in Operation Tiger, gradually pushing the HV back towards Dubrovnik. On 23 July, the HV 1st Guards Brigade counter-attacked north of Zaton, pushing the VRS {{north and east}} towards Popovo field. The attack, codenamed Operation Liberated Land (Croatian: Operacija Oslobođena zemlja), failed to cut off a battalion of the VRS 472nd Motorized Brigade deployed to Bobani, and the 4th Guards Brigade had to be deployed to <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the area. Although substantial parts of the territory gained during the attack were surrendered to the VRS, the operation strengthened the HV defences in the area by 8 August.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{initially}} agreeing {{to send troops}} to Borneo in the opening stages of the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, the Australian government did allow its forces stationed in Malaysia {{as part of the}} Far East Strategic Reserve (FESR) to be used to protect Peninsular Malaysia from Indonesian attack. 3 RAR, which was based at Camp Terendak in Malacca, was subsequently used to <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> two small airborne and seaborne landings near Labis and Pontian in September and October 1964. These incursions suggested that a major escalation in the conflict was imminent, and in January 1965 the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests, subsequently agreeing to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo, in addition to a battery of artillery, an engineer construction squadron, and a squadron from the Special Air Service Regiment.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} keep up {{pressure}} on the whole front, the 19th Indian Brigade was ordered to attack Villa Grande and exploit any gains {{as far as the}} Arielli river which ran from the mountains through Tollo to the Adriatic. The attack went in at 05:30 on 22 December but failed in desperate fighting. The 1/5th Battalion, Essex Regiment renewed their attack the following morning with more success. After a counterattack by German paratroops had been repulsed at midday, the Essex advanced to <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the remainder of the village. However, deadly small scale house-to-house battles continued throughout the rest of 23 December and for the next two days as the determined parachute soldiers clung on. To the south of Villa Grande, the 3rd/15th Punjabis had taken Vezzano on 23 December and a continuous brigade line had been established.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, 207. Infanteriedivision was for {{the first}} time {{committed}} to battle at the Grebbeberg itself when two battalions of its 322. Infanterieregiment attacked the Stop Line. The first wave of German attackers was beaten back with serious losses, but a second wave managed to fragment the trench line, which then was taken after heavy fighting. The regiment subsequently proceeded to <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the area to the west, delayed by resistance from several Dutch command posts. It withdrew in the late afternoon, just as the SS battalions further north, to avoid a preparatory artillery bombardment, shifted to a more western position. After redeployment the Germans intended to renew their attack in order to take the Rhenen fall-back line and the village of Achterberg. However, these preparations would prove to be superfluous: the Dutch had already disappeared.|$|E

5|$|The 8th Infantry Brigade now {{began to}} <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the area. On 18 February, the 35th Infantry Battalion {{attacked}} a Japanese force near Gabutamon, killing 40. Finding {{a force of}} about 100 Japanese at nearby Tapen, they attacked, killing another 52 Japanese {{for the loss of}} one man wounded, while the Papuans on their flanks killed another 51, of whom 43 were accounted for by Corporal Bengari and two other Papuans. The next day, the Papuans found and killed another 39 Japanese in the vicinity. At Tapen, the Australians and Papuans also found evidence that the Japanese had resorted to cannibalism. In the period of 20 January – 1 March 1944, 734 Japanese were killed, 1,775 found dead and 48 were captured. Australian casualties came to four killed and six wounded.|$|E
5|$|A {{detachment}} {{under the}} command of Major F.P. Chuvakin from the 2nd Brigade composed of 45 tanks, 37 of which were from the brigade and the remaining eight from the KMG, and a machine gun and rifle battalion, was attached to the KMG to <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> remaining Polish resistance in the Augustów Forest and to prevent them from fleeing to Lithuania. On 22 September, in the area of Sapotskin, the detachment engaged units of the Polish 101st and 102nd Uhlan Regiments, as well as the 110th Reserve Uhlan Regiment, and other units retreating from Grodno. Most of the Polish troops escaped into the forest because of the slow advance of the detachment. Around three companies of Polish troops were dispersed and several officers were killed, among them the Grodno defense commander, Józef Olszyna-Wilczyński. The retreating Polish forces left mines behind them, which blew up four BT-7 tanks. Chuvakin's troops also lost 11 killed and 14 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Farleigh Hungerford Castle was {{captured}} by a Royalist unit in 1643, following a successful campaign by the King's forces across the south-west. The castle was taken without a fight by Colonel John Hungerford, a half-brother of Edward, who installed a garrison that then supported itself by pillaging the surrounding countryside. Several Parliamentary raids against Farleigh Hungerford were undertaken during 1644, but they failed {{to take back the}} castle. By 1645, however, the Royalist cause was close to military collapse; Parliamentary forces began to <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the remaining Royalist garrisons in the south-west, and on 15 September they reached the castle. Colonel Hungerford immediately surrendered on good terms, and Sir Edward Hungerford peacefully reinstalled himself in the undamaged castle. As a result of this process, the castle escaped being slighted, or deliberately destroyed, by Parliament, unlike many other castles in the region, such as Nunney.|$|E

5|$|From 8 December 1944 to 23 February 1945, the {{division}} {{was assigned to}} XIII Corps and held defensive positions along the Rur and prepared for the next major offensive. The division was reassigned to XIX Corps, and the attack jumped off across the Rur on 23 February, and carried {{the division}} through Jülich, Broich, Immerath, and Titz, to Mönchengladbach by 1 March 1945. The division was out of combat in March. In early April the division was reassigned to XVI Corps, where the 116th Infantry helped <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> in the Ruhr area. On 19 April 1945 the division, assigned to XIII Corps, pushed to the Elbe River and held defensive positions until 4 May. Meanwhile, the 175th Infantry cleared the Klotze Forest. After V-E Day, the division was on military duty in the Bremen enclave. It was assigned to XVI Corps again for this assignment.|$|E
5|$|The Indonesia-Malaysia {{confrontation}} {{was fought}} from 1962 to 1966 between the British Commonwealth and Indonesia over {{the creation of}} the Federation of Malaysia, with the Commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state. The war remained limited, and was fought primarily on the island of Borneo, although a number of Indonesian seaborne and airborne incursions onto the Malay Peninsula did occur. As part of Australia's continuing military commitment to the security of Malaysia, army, naval and airforce units were based there as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. Regardless the Australian government was wary of involvement in a war with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the Malayan peninsula only. On two occasions Australian troops from 3 RAR were used to help <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> infiltrators from seaborne and airborne incursions at Labis and Pontian, in September and October 1964.|$|E
5|$|While Charles Theodore's {{dream of}} a Burgundian renaissance receded, Joseph {{continued}} on his course to annex part of Bavaria. The widow—Max Joseph's widow or the mother-in-law or both—petitioned Prussia on behalf of Charles II August. Frederick's envoys to the heir presumptive convinced this slighted prince to lodge protests with the Imperial Diet in Regensburg. Joseph's troops remained in portions of Bavaria, even establishing an Austrian administration at Straubing, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. Austrian occupation of Bavaria was unacceptable to Charles August's champion, Frederick. Prussian troops mobilized near Prussia's border with Bohemia, reminiscent of the invasion in 1740 that so endangered Maria Theresa's succession to the Habsburg hereditary lands. Meanwhile, the French wriggled out of their diplomatic obligations to Austria, telling Joseph {{that there would be}} no military support from Paris for a war against Prussia. Britain, Prussia's strongest ally, was already mired in a war in North America, but Prussia's military had recovered from the Seven Years' War and Frederick did not require any help. Prussia's other ally, Saxony, aligned by two marriages with Charles August, was strategically prepared for war against Austria and ready to contribute twenty thousand troops. Watching from St. Petersburg, Catherine II was willing to <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the spoils of war for the Russian Empire but did not want to get involved in another costly European conflict.|$|E
