40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} matching {{problems with}} individual/regional minimum/maximum quotas. Although such quotas are relevant in many real-world settings, {{there is a}} lack of strategyproof mechanisms that take such quotas into account. We first show that without any restrictions on the regional structure, checking the existence of a feasible matching that satisfies all quotas is NP-complete. Then, assuming that regions have a hierarchical structure (i. e., a tree), we show that checking the existence of a feasible matching can be done in time linear in the number of regions. We develop two strategyproof matching mechanisms based on the Deferred Acceptance mechanism (DA), which we call Priority List based Deferred Acceptance with Regional minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>Quotas</b> (PLDA-RQ) and Round-robin Selection Deferred Acceptance with Regional minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>Quotas</b> (RSDA-RQ). When regional quotas are imposed, a stable matching may no longer exist since fairness and nonwastefulness, which compose stability, are incompatible. We show that both mechanisms are fair. As a result, they are inevitably wasteful. We show that the two mechanisms satisfy different versions of nonwastefulness respectively; each is weaker than the original nonwastefulness. Moreover, we compare our mechanisms with an artificial cap mechanism via simulation experiments, which illustrate that they have a clear advantage in terms of nonwastefulness and student welfare...|$|R
500|$|The 2008 Summer Olympics {{marked the}} seventh {{appearance}} of an Olympic women's road race event. [...] Qualification {{for the race}} was restricted to three athletes per National Olympic Committee (NOC) for the 16 top-ranked countries in overall Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) standings at 1 June 2008, and a maximum of two athletes each for the countries ranking 1724. An NOC with an athlete in the top 100 at 31 May 2008 received a place, which {{was taken from the}} countries ranked 1724 in reversed order, provided that these athletes qualified through the UCI World Tour rankings. Additionally, three places were available at the B World Championship for NOCs that did not qualify through the UCI standing; Gu Sun-Geun, Hae Ok-Jeong and Thatsani Wichana secured Olympic qualification for their NOCs in this way, but only the first was chosen by her national committee to compete. The <b>maximum</b> <b>quota</b> of the event was set at 67 cyclists, and as of 5 June, 66 cyclists were qualified in this way. Although the Chinese and Austrian NOCs were allowed to enter three cyclists, they only entered two. This left three open positions: two were allotted to South Africa and New Zealand, based on their World Tour rankings, and the third was given to Mauritius by direct invitation. Only 66 of the 67 entrants began the race, as María Isabel Moreno of Spain left the country days earlier after failing a drug test.|$|E

It further determined that all relevant costs to the national government needed to be accounted for in determining production costs and that the state should cease compensating for losses incurred by state enterprises.

40|$|Increased {{globalization}} {{of higher education}} has occurred as more students from across the world now enrol in universities abroad for their post-school education. We study the consequences of having more foreign students {{in one of the}} world’s biggest receivers of international students, the UK’s higher educational system. To do so, we estimate the impact of growing numbers of international students on the number of domestic students. Using rich administrative data, we find no evidence of crowd out of domestic undergraduates whose enrolment numbers are regulated by <b>maximum</b> <b>quotas.</b> For domestic postgraduates, who do not face such quotas, there is evidence of crowd in. We establish causality of this relationship by employing two empirical strategies to predict exogenous international student growth. The first uses shift-share instruments based on historical patterns of student enrolment from countries attending specific university departments. The second is based on the fast growth in enrolment of Chinese students which was facilitated by changes in visa regulations in combination with distinct subject of study preferences...|$|R
40|$|We study {{matching}} {{markets in}} which institutions may have minimum (in {{addition to the}} more standard <b>maximum)</b> <b>quotas.</b> Minimum quotas are important in many settings (for ex-ample, hospital residency matching, military cadet matching, and school choice) but popular mechanisms are unable to accommodate them. We introduce two new classes of strategyproof mechanisms that allow for minimum quotas as an explicit input, and show that our mecha-nisms improve welfare relative to current approaches. Because of an incompatibility between standard fairness and nonwastefulness axioms {{in the presence of}} minimum quotas, we intro-duce new second-best axioms and show that they are satisfied by our mechanisms. Last, use computer simulations to quantify (i) the number of agents who will strictly prefer our mech-anisms and (ii) how far they are from the first-best axioms of fairness and nonwastefulness. Combining both the theoretical and simulation results, we argue that our mechanisms should improve the performance of matching markets with minimum quota constraints in practice...|$|R
