40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a <b>maintenance</b> <b>documentation</b> <b>system</b> with a number of features contributing significantly towards process improvement and software reuse. The system makes extensive use of techniques of logic programming [1] to enable effective software change management, requirements traceability and continuous creation of templates for cross project use. A repository of such templates is essential to the attainment of level 5 in the CMM model [2]. This is because with such a repository in place, a manager can switch a project from a waterfall process model to a prototyping model when there is such a need. Furthermore, these templates are useful towards procedure reuse [3] in the sense that they can be interconnected and then instantiated to give rise to new and more complex process [4]. With regard to software reuse, the system is also successful largely due to the extensive use of techniques of logic programming. An example of such scenarios is given by the [...] ...|$|R

This paper introduces a general method for belief maintenance, based on (the propositional fragment of) probabilistic logic, that extends the Boolean Constraint Propagation method {{used by the}} logic-based truth <b>maintenance</b> <b>systems.</b> From the concept of probabilistic entailment, we derive a set of constraints on the (probabilistic) truth-values of propositions and we prove their soundness.

Introduction In 1978 Jon Doyle wrote a masters thesis at the MIT AI Laboratory entitled "Truth <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Systems</b> for Problem Solving" [Doyle, 1979]. In this thesis Doyle described an independent module called a truth <b>maintenance</b> <b>system,</b> or TMS, which maintained beliefs for general problem solving systems. In the twelve years since the appearance of Doyle's TMS a large body of literature has accumulated on truth maintenance. The seminal idea appears not to have been any particular technical mechanism but rather the general concept of an independent module for truth (or belief) maintenance.

The reasoning system provides the RMS with information about each inference it performs, and in return the RMS provides the reasoning system with information about the whole set of inferences. Several implementations of reasoning <b>maintenance</b> <b>systems</b> have been proposed in the past, remarkable ones being Doyle's truth <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> (TMS) [6], and De Kleer's assumption-based truth <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> (ATMS) [7].
