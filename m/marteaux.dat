By {{the end of the war}} the FI national committee would include representation from a large number of resistance organisations such as the Armée belge des partisans (PA), the Milices Patriotiques (MP) (Patriotic Militias), Wallonie indépendante (Independent Wallonia), the Rassemblement national de la jeunesse (National Rally of Youth) and the country's main parties and trade unions.|$|E

The {{aim of the}} organisation was to unite Belgian resistance groups of all opinions and political leanings; nonetheless the only political party that that was affiliated as such was the Communist Party. The FI operated a significant propaganda, social and paramilitary organization, {{in addition to its}} military and sabotage functions and operated in competition with the larger pro-government Armée secrète.|$|E

50|$|Bessière {{also made}} his mark on French science fiction {{through a number of}} non-connected novels that {{featured}} an original blend of horror and science fiction.

The ultimately doomed reconquest of a post-cataclysmic Earth ruled by mutants and deadly lifeforms, was the subject of Légion Alpha (1961), Les Sept Anneaux de Rhéa Seven Rings Of Rhea (1962), in which Earth was described as seven concentric spheres with Hell at its core, and Les Jardins de l’Apocalypse Gardens Of The Apocalypse (1963). Les <b>Marteaux</b> de Vulcain Hammers Of Vulcan (1969) described a nightmarish planet where survival was all but impossible.|$|E

40|$|Adolescence is {{a period}} that is marked by an {{identity}} crisis which is itself {{a consequence of the}} balance-unsettling puberty transformations following the earlier resolution of the oedipal complex. Balance will be once again activated after the latency period. These transformations trigger others on the affective level (emotional, bonds to earlier objects). A crisis in the social bond can also be observed through this questioning of norms along with family and social values. These different crises contributing to identity construction are "developmental tasks" typical in subjects who actually go through this period; hence they constitute an important process of maturation. The subject can however face difficulties fulfilling those tasks. The article engages this challenge of grieving the passing infancy with its particular symbols as experienced by some adolescents in their responsibility to work out new symbols. In fact, every developmental crisis should, according to Wallon (1963), mediate the passing to the next stage. It is therefore manageable. In the special case of adolescents in the street, the persistence of the crisis characterized by anti-social behaviors specific to this population is nothing else but the difficulty in letting go of the symbols of infancy. This argument about the ‘grieving over infancy’ or mourning of infancy draws on works such as Nasio (2004); Delvenne Nicolis (2007); <b>Marteaux</b> (2008) and Franceschini (2012). The results collected through interviews and observations show the persistence in ‘street adolescents’ of behaviors unfavorable to the realization and reorganization of identity...|$|E
40|$|Many {{people love}} opera. Far many more find it utterly absurd. For the latter, {{the idea that}} there exists a form of {{dramatic}} entertainment that utilizes all the trappings of the theatre – the sets and costumes, the make-up and lighting – but in which all the dialogue is sung, beggars belief. The purpose of this commentary is to set down the contemplations of a composer who, no less bemused than most by the matter, has attempted better to understand the operatic proposition by writing one for himself. As varied as such contemplations have been, a systematic approach has been adopted in the present document, categorizing identifiably discrete areas for consideration, but moving always towards the alliance of all such elements in the multidisciplinary form under scrutiny. Reference is made throughout, {{to a wide range of}} works from many disciplines in the hope both of clarifying and invigorating the account. It was, however, considered indispensable to an honest appraisal of the subject at hand, that two areas of concern to the author be aired at the outset. The first of these relates to questions regarding the utility of music and the belief, expressed herein, that such evaluation is quite inappropriate. The second relates to the belief, equally strongly held, that a good deal of musical critique is deleterious to the understanding and enjoyment of music. The commentary proper gets under way with a discussion of the nature of music itself – whether it is a language, and if not, then what? – whether it has meaning, and if so, then by what means? The discussion then moves on to the world of words and the consideration of language in everyday usage, and then in the area of linguistic art. The focus of this passage moves from the general, to the specifics of language as drama, this area seeming to offer the most advantageous comparison with music. Poetry is touched upon lightly. The field of incidental music is taken up as the first meeting point between words and music by reason of the fact that for a majority of people in the developed world it represents the place of most common encounter with words and music combined. It is also an area in which music is clearly understood to be subservient to language and it therefore provides a starting point for a journey from one condition of relative value to another. The next area for examination is that of song; first the popular song (and in particular “Les feuilles mortes” by Kosma and Prévert) along with some discussion of translation and appropriation, and then the art song, through a brief account of Schubert’s Der Erlkönig. There is then a consideration of opera itself and an attempt to draw some conclusions, based on the previous discussions, concerning the extent to which libretto and music can be truly and beneficially alloyed in a dramatic work. The decline and final disappearance of spoken dialogue is cited as evidence of the progressive musical domination of the genre. But, in turn, questions arise as to the viability of the sung dramatic discourse. Matters of mutual responsibility between collaborators are also discussed. Finally, there is a brief account of how these contemplations informed the composition of The Hoop of the World, along with a few of the measures that were adopted in response to certain perceived difficulties inherent in the operatic form. The composer is not yet clear as to whether or not a true personal reconciliation with the genre as a whole has been achieved but there is a deeper sense of engagement with the proposition that may well lead to further creative exploits. The folio of works includes two instrumental works, <b>Marteaux</b> suspendus, for solo piano, and “x,y” for percussion ensemble. There is no mention of these works in the critical commentary, as such relationships as they bear to the operatic work are of a purely technical nature and of no relevance to the principal chosen topic of discussion...|$|E
