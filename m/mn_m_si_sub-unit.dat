The {{high tensile strength}} characteristic of strong interfacial filament/matrix bonding can, however, be combined with the high fracture toughness of weak interfacial bonding, when the filaments are arranged to have alternate sections {{of high and low}} shear stress (and low and high toughness). Such weak and strong areas can be achieved by appropriate intermittent coating of the fibres. The strong regions ensure that the filament strength is picked up; weak areas randomly in the path of running cracks serve to blunt them by the Cook/Gordon mechanism which, in turn, produces long pull-out lengths with an associated large contribution to toughness.
