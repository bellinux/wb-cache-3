40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), patients can be protected against sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular arrhythmia (VA). Guidelines have been drawn up for selecting patients for primary and secondary prophylaxis. However, most ICD recipients today who receive an ICD for primary prevention will not experience a <b>life-threatening</b> <b>VA</b> requiring antitachypacing or shock therapy. Better risk stratification is desirable with efficacy, costs and complication rate in mind. An overview is presented of widely accepted and potentially valuable risk markers and the role they may play in better identifying candidates for ICD therapy.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether circadian patterns in ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) occur in a current primary prevention defibrillator (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [ICD]) population. BackgroundCardiovascular events, including VAs, demonstrate biorhythmic periodicity. MethodsWe tested for deviation from the previously described occurrences of a morning peak, early morning nadir, and peak on Mondays in ICD therapies using generalized estimating equations and Student t tests. All hypothesis tests were performed in the entire cohort of patients with VAs as well as pre-specified subgroups. ResultsOf 811 patients with an ICD, 186 subjects experienced 714 ICD therapy episodes for <b>life-threatening</b> <b>VA.</b> There was no morning (6 am to 12 pm) peak in therapies for the entire cohort or any subgroups. The overall cohort and several subgroups had a typical early morning (12 am to 6 am) nadir in therapies, with significantly less than 25 % of therapies occurring during this 6 -h block (all p < 0. 05). A significant peak in therapies on Mondays occurred only in patients not on beta-blocker therapy (22 % of events for the week, p = 0. 029). ConclusionsIn the SCD-HeFT (Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial) population, the distribution of <b>life-threatening</b> <b>VA</b> failed to show a typical early morning peak or increased VA events on Mondays. A typical early morning nadir was seen in the entire cohort. An increased rate of events on Mondays {{was found in the}} subgroup of subjects not on beta-blocker therapy. These findings may indicate suppression of the neurohormonal triggers for VA by current heart failure therapy, particularly the use of beta-blockers in heart failure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESTo {{evaluate}} a possible effect of lipid lowering drugs on recurrences of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) after {{implantable cardioverter defibrillator}} (ICD) implantation. BACKGROUNDIn patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), lipid lowering drugs reduce total and sudden cardiac death. Because the mechanism is not completely understood, we studied whether these drugs have a favorable influence on the occurrence of <b>life-threatening</b> <b>VA</b> in patients with CAD and ICD implants. METHODSWe conducted an observational study in 78 patients with CAD and <b>life-threatening</b> <b>VA,</b> treated with an ICD. After ICD implantation, 27 patients were on treatment with lipid lowering drugs (group I) and 51 were not (group II). Patients were studied for the following end points: recurrences of VA requiring ICD intervention, cardiac death and hospitalization. RESULTSAfter a mean follow-up of 490 ± 319 days, 35 patients (45 %) had recurrences of VA requiring ICD intervention. In multivariate analysis, the use of lipid lowering drugs (chi-square 6. 33, p = 0. 012) and poorly tolerated sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia as initial presentation (chi-square 4. 84, p = 0. 028) remained as independent predictors of recurrences of VA. Patients in groups I and II had similar baseline clinical characteristics, but patients in group I had a lower incidence of recurrences of VA (6 / 27 or 22 % vs. 29 / 51 or 57 %, p = 0. 004) and of the combined end points of cardiac death and hospitalization (4 / 27 or 15 % vs. 23 / 51 or 45 %, p = 0. 015) compared with patients in group II. CONCLUSIONSThis is the first observation {{that the use of}} lipid lowering drugs is associated with a reduction of recurrences of VA in patients with CAD and ICD implants. These data require confirmation in a prospective randomized trial...|$|R

50|$|Complications include pericarditis, pericardial effusion, pericardial tamponade, pleuritis, and {{pulmonary}} infiltration. Of these {{cardiac tamponade}} is the <b>most</b> <b>life-threatening</b> complication. The pericardial fluid increases intra-pericardial pressure therefore preventing complete {{expansion of the}} atria and the ventricles upon the diastole. This causes equilibration of the pressure in all four heart chambers, and results in the common findings of the tamponade which are pulsus paradoxus, Beck's triad of hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and JVD, as well as EKG or Holter monitor findings such as electrical alternans. Physically the patients who progress to severe pericardial tamponade obtundate, become mentally altered, and lethargic.

As a result, only a few new antiarrhythmic agents have success-fully completed clinical development programs and reached routine clinical usage over the past 20 years.
