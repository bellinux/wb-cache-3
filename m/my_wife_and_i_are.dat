6000|$|I:2:52 [...] ALAR. [...] In truth, good sirs, [...] <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> {{somewhat}} strangers here, [...] And {{things that}} are of moment to the minds [...] That long have dwelt on them, to us are nought.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My Dear Theodora,--You judged rightly that I am no man to trifle, or {{to raise}} {{expectations}} which I {{did not mean}} to fulfil. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> at Matlock for a few days before joining at Winchester.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not," [...] he agreed. [...] "It is {{probably}} no secret {{to you that}} <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> temporarily estranged," [...] he continued. [...] "The chief reason for that estrangement is that I forbade her your house or your acquaintance." ...|$|E
50|$|The play's {{original}} title was <b>My</b> <b>Wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Some {{time ago}} <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hatched out twelve little tadpoles. They were the sweetest {{children}} parents ever looked on. Their heads {{were all very}} large and round, and their tails were long and feathery, while their skins were as black and shiny as could be. We were proud of them, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>and</b> took great pains to train our children properly, that they might become respectable frogs, in time, and be a credit to us.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{could not}} forbear exchanging a glance of intelligence, which Mrs. Hasketh intercepted.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Archibald had a {{very sharp}} sense of the humorous, and in his {{enjoyment}} of a comical situation he liked company. His heart was stirred to put his expedition in its true light before this man who was so honest and plain-spoken. [...] "Mr. Sadler," [...] said he, [...] "if you will {{take it as a}} piece of confidential information, and not intended for the general ear, I will tell you what sort of a holiday <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> taking. We are on a wedding-journey." [...] And then he told the story of the proxy bridal tour.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> Americans, and at {{the time}} of this story were middle-aged people and very fond of seeing in each other's company {{whatever}} there was of interest or beauty around us. We had a son about twenty-two years old, of whom we were also very fond; but he was not with us, being at that time a student in Germany. Although we had good health, we were not very robust people, and, under ordinary circumstances, not much given to long country tramps. I was of medium size, without much muscular development, while my wife was quite stout, and growing stouter.|$|E
60|$|My {{ideas are}} cramped, you say?--Oh, I {{forgot to tell}} you that this home I am {{describing}} is to be a floating home, and that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> to journey around the world in it for the matter of seven years or more. I forgot also to state that there will be an engine-room in it for a seventy-horse-power engine, a dynamo, storage batteries, etc.; tanks for water to last long weeks at sea; space for fifteen hundred gallons of gasolene, fire extinguishers, and life-preservers; and a great store-room for food, spare sails, anchors, hawsers, tackles, and a thousand and one other things.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> opened the portfolio, {{and read the}} strange story of George Germaine's marriage.|$|R
60|$|MANY {{years have}} passed since <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> left the United States to pay our first visit to England.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> now, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> {{out of our}} single heart, return you {{our deepest}} and most {{grateful}} thanks, and--yesterday was her birthday.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right, monsieur; but <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> glad to {{see that}} it is otherwise, and that, after all you have risked for that pretty creature, {{you are going to be}} happy together. My wife was not surprised. Women are sharper than men in these matters, and she said to me, when she heard what you were going to do to save them, 'I would wager, Pierre, that one of these mesdemoiselles is not monsieur's sister. Men will do a great deal for their sister, but I never heard of a man {{throwing}} away his life as he is going to do on the mere chance of saving one.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Unless you are braver {{than almost}} any one has ever been. They don't often put people to sleep there, but {{sometimes}} the house is so crowded that they have to. The same thing always happens--ill-concealed agitation at the breakfast-table and letters of the greatest importance. Of course it's a bachelor's room, and <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> {{at the other end}} of the house. But we saw the comedy three days ago--the day after we got here. A young fellow had been put there--I forget his name--the house was so full; and the usual consequence followed. Letters at breakfast--an awfully queer face--an urgent call to town--so very sorry his visit was cut short. Ashmore and his wife looked at each other, and off the poor devil went.' ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR COGGIE,--We {{are very}} much distressed to hear of this which has befallen your family. As for Sir Alexander, I can but speak from my own feelings: he survived to finish his book and to conduct, with such a great success, the tercentenary. Ah, how many die just upon the threshold! Had he died a year ago, how great a disappointment! But all this is nothing to the survivors. Do please, {{as soon as you}} are able, let us know how it goes and how it is likely to go with the family; and believe that both <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> most anxious to have good news, or the best possible. My poor Coggie, I know very well how you must feel; you are passing a bad time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, sir," [...] he said, [...] "excuse me. This {{woman is}} <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feared {{that she was}} drowned. You have brought me back to life." ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{through the}} land at eve we went, [...] And pluck'd the ripen'd ears. We fell out, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> [...] <b>And</b> kissed again with tears: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is inconceivable," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "that any {{one should}} attempt the descent! We have rugs, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I.</b> We stay here till the clouds pass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{write to}} you, dear sir, at my brother's request. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> {{doing all that}} we can to relieve and comfort him, but his mind has not yet {{sufficiently}} recovered to enable him to write to you himself. He desires to thank you heartily for your sympathy, at the most trying period of his life; and he trusts to your kindness to let him hear, from time to time, of Mr. Keller's progress towards recovery, and of {{the well-being of the}} business. In addressing your letters to me at Bingen, you will be pleased to consider the information of my brother's whereabouts herein afforded to you as strictly confidential, until you hear from me to the contrary. In his present frame of mind, {{it would be in the}} last degree painful to him to be made the subject of inquiries, remonstrances, or entreaties to return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{but one of}} the Flatheads {{thought he}} wanted to be the Su-dic and tried to get my people to rebel against me, so I punished him by taking away his brains. One day my wife scolded me severely, so I took away her can of brains. She didn't like that and went out and robbed several women of their brains. Then I made a law that if anyone stole another's brains, or even tried to borrow them, he would forfeit his own brains to the Su-dic. So each one is content with his own canned brains and <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> the only ones on the {{mountain}} with more than one can. I have three cans and that makes me very clever--so clever that I'm a good Sorcerer, if I do say it myself. My poor wife had four cans of brains and became a remarkable witch, but alas! that was before those terrible enemies, the Skeezers, transformed her into a Golden Pig." ...|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR CUMMY, - <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> {{very much}} vexed {{to hear you}} are still unwell. We are both keeping far better; she {{especially}} seems quite to have taken a turn - THE turn, we shall hope. Please let us know how you get on, and {{what has been the}} matter with you; Braemar I believe - the vile hole. You know what a lazy rascal I am, so you won't be surprised at a short letter, I know; indeed, you will be much more surprised at my having had the decency to write at all. We have got rid of our young, pretty, and incompetent maid; and now we have a fine, canny, twinkling, shrewd, auld-farrant peasant body, who gives us good food and keeps us in good spirits. If we could only understand what she says! But she speaks Davos language, which is to German what Aberdeen-awa' is to English, so it comes heavy. God bless you, my dear Cummy; and so says Fanny forbye. - Ever your affectionate, ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{were seated}} at breakfast one morning, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> when the maid {{brought in a}} telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{then you}} cannot quite {{understand}} it. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{have been married}} for nearly fifty years, and we have never been parted, never at all, until now." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>My</b> <b>Wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was a British {{television}} comedy which {{aired on}} ITV in 1958. It {{was produced by}} Associated-Rediffusion Television. It starred Mai Zetterling, Rex Garner and Joan Benham.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear {{and more}} than dear Bishop,--It would be vain for me to write to you, if I pretended {{to do more than}} just express my heart's wish that I could say {{something}} of the doings and sufferings which now for years past we of course associate with your name, so as to encourage and support you in your present manifold distress. But (especially for reasons known only to myself) I must leave that altogether to Him who helps His own to do and suffer. One thing only I would say, that to us at our great distance it looks as if the sanguis martyrum were being to you as the semen Ecclesiae, and you know how such things were hailed in the time of St. Cyprian. May it please God before long to give you some visible earnest of this sure blessing! but I suppose that if it tarry, it may be the greater when it comes. Our troubles as a Church, though of a different kind, are not small. The great point with me is, lest, if in our anxiety to keep things together, we should be sinfully conniving at what is done against the faith, and so bringing a judgment upon ourselves. I do not for a moment think that by anything which has yet been done or permitted our being as a Church is compromised (though things look alarmingly as if it might be before long), but I fear that her well-being is more and more being damaged by our entire and conscious surrender of the disciplinary part of our trust, and that if we are apathetic in such things we may forfeit our charter. There is no doubt, I fear, that personal unbelief is spreading; but I trust that a deeper faith is spreading also; it is (at Oxford, e.g.) Pusey and Moberly, &c., against the Rationalists and other tempters. As to the question of the Bible being (not only containing) the Word, I had no scruples in signing that Declaration. One thought which helped me was, the use made in the New Testament of the Old, which is such as to show that we are not competent judges as to what passages convey deep moral or religious meanings or no. Another, that in every instance where one had the means of ascertaining, so far as I have known, the Bible difficulty has come right: therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that so it would be in all the rest, if we knew the right reading and the right interpretation of the words. And as to what are called the Divine and Human Elements, I have seemed to help myself with the thought that the Divine adoption (if so be) of the human words warrants their truthfulness, as a man's signature makes a letter his own; but whether this is relevant, I doubt. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> both on the sick list, and I must now only add that we never forget you.|$|E
5000|$|In {{expanding}} {{upon his}} hopes for additional exhibitions planned for China and the Middle East, Kaplan explained that [...] "rather than silently acquiescing {{to the building}} of walls or the burning of bridges, (<b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I)</b> <b>are</b> using the most powerful tools we have, Rembrandt and our passion, to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{hired by}} Oklahoma State Young {{stated that he}} was torn between having to choose between Miami and OSU. He also {{went on to say}} [...] "It {{means a lot to me}} to come back to OSU because I am a graduate, I played there and now we are back as part of the Cowboy family. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> very excited to get back to Stillwater and Oklahoma State." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{will think}} it over. I am {{fond of the}} sea, but shall {{certainly}} be fonder of <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feel that your wishes in the matter should weigh with me.” ...|$|R
60|$|Left in the dark, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> sought each other's arms again, {{and stood}} {{together}} {{for a few moments}} heart to heart, tightly clasping each other, and kissed each other fervently.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then I {{will get}} to my {{business}} without delay. I thought it might interest {{you to know that}} I propose to bring a counter-petition against <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall make you co-respondent.' ...|$|R
5000|$|On 16 May 2012, Taia {{signed a}} 3-year deal with French Super League club, Catalans Dragons {{starting}} in 2013. Taia {{said about the}} move, [...] "Whilst <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> looking forward to experiencing life in another country, a beautiful one at that, I am forever indebted to the Knights. Not just for the time I have been here but the support they showed me, particularly last season during a potentially career ending injury." ...|$|E
5000|$|A wealthy {{individual}} {{happened upon}} David {{as he was}} painting, {{and after a moment}} he simply asked; [...] "When do you intend to go to Europe?"David replied; [...] "As soon as I have the means.""How much have you?""Eight hundred dollars.""Well, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> going to New York by the next steamer. You had better go along."So, with that, and after four years in San Francisco, 1861 he was off to Munich to attend the Royal Academy.|$|E
5000|$|Elias' {{support in}} his letter to Moro said, [...] "Congratulations to the awards!!!! Wonderful but it does not come as a surprise. The film is great. I had one {{exchange}} of letters with Steven Spielberg. You can write to him and let him know that I am supporting you and love the film. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> moved especially how Anne's and Otto's words are integrated in this film. With so much sensitivity. Thank you." ...|$|E
60|$|I did not wonder, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{agreed to}} go with him that very evening to old Mr. Scott's house. The old gentleman {{received}} us very cordially in his little parlor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Croyden," [...] I answered, [...] "Edith--it means this. I {{have never}} {{found the courage}} to tell you. I am a married man. The woman seated there is <b>my</b> <b>wife.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> love you." ...|$|R
60|$|We both {{thank you}} greatly for the Edinburgh papers which you sent. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> join in affectionate remembrances and {{greetings}} to {{yourself and your}} aunt, and in the sincere tender of our sympathies.|$|R
