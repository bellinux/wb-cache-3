40|$|Few {{experimental}} {{data are available}} on ultrasonic attenuation in <b>molten</b> light <b>alloys</b> {{due to lack of}} means of characterization.

Hence, the attenuation of the ultrasonic amplitude with propagation distance can be effectively assessed according to the variations in the grain density with propagation distance.

Consequently, the attenuation behavior of the ultrasonic amplitude with propagation distance can be described by the same exponential law. The characteristic ultrasonic attenuation coefficients in three benchmark <b>molten</b> magnesium <b>alloys</b> investigated were determined accordingly.

50|$|The term {{is named}} after a German mining {{engineer}} and chemist Friedrich Heusler, who studied such a compound in 1903. It contained two parts copper, one part manganese, and one part tin, that is Cu2MnSn, and has the following properties. Its magnetism varies considerably with heat treatment and composition. It has a room-temperature saturation induction of around 8,000 gauss, which exceeds that of the element nickel (around 6100 gauss) but is smaller than that of iron (around 21500 gauss). For early studies see. In 1934, Bradley and Rogers showed that the room-temperature ferromagnetic phase was a fully ordered structure of the L21 type. This has a primitive cubic lattice of copper atoms with alternate cells body-centered by manganese and aluminium. The lattice parameter is 5.95 Ångströms. The <b>molten</b> <b>alloy</b> has a solidus temperature of about 910 °C. As it is cooled below this temperature, it transforms into disordered, solid, body-centered cubic beta-phase. Below 750 °C, a B2 ordered lattice forms with a primitive cubic copper lattice, which is body-centered by a disordered manganese-aluminium sublattice. Cooling below 610 °C causes further ordering of the manganese and aluminium sub-lattice to the L21 form. In non-stoichiometric alloys, the temperatures of ordering decrease, {{and the range of}} anealing temperatures, where the alloy does not form microprecipitates, becomes smaller than for the stoichiometric material.|$|E
