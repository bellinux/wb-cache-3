40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} which concepts regarding “the good life” {{are used in}} <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> of nursing homes providing care for demented patients. Method: All 317 Dutch nursing homes caring for demented patients were asked to participate; of these, 69 % responded. Their <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> were qualitatively analyzed on content. Whether different types of nursing home differed significantly {{in the content of}} their <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> was investigated by means of χ 2 analyses. Results: Six main concepts were found that are considered important for a good life: 1) autonomy and freedom, 2) individuality and lifestyle, 3) relationships and social networks, 4) warmth and safety and familiarity, 5) developing capacities and giving meaning to life and 6) subjective experience and feelings of well-being. It was found that <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> specifically developed for demented patients attach less importance to the concepts 1) autonomy and freedom and 2) individuality and lifestyle, than <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> which are also aimed at non-demented residents. Most <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> turned out to be highly eclectic in content. Conclusion: Nursing homes with a separate statement for demented residents seem to acknowledge the special position of demented residents and the tension between dementia and the ideal of autonomy. Although the eclecticism found in <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> is understandable, a coherent view on the good life for demented residents should aim for a sound internal structure, and make choices between values.

5|$|Inspired by Hirschfeld's {{work with}} the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Gerber {{resolved}} to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (the English translation of Bund für Menschenrecht) and took {{on the role of}} secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined the goals and purposes of the Society: o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as they protect the rights of others, and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to the public welfare. An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation. Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its <b>mission</b> <b>statement,</b> Society members were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter.|$|E

30|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} how {{differently}} corporate enterprises and social enterprises strategically position themselves through their <b>mission</b> <b>statements.</b> The most notable distinctions between the <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> of both groups exist {{in the degree of}} action orientation, endorsements of people/groups, and the highlights of positive entailment. The new and renewable energy sector is playing {{a key role in the}} emergence of India as an environmentally conscious emerging economy. The enterprises instrumental in this change are both social and corporate enterprises. While technology is important, a key factor to success is strategic approach. The vision and <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> are strategically crafted by organizations to position themselves in the industry. This motivated the authors to carry out a comparative analysis of the <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> of social and corporate enterprises to learn about the existing differences. Efforts were employed to quantify the narrative style and tonality of <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> by applying DICTION software. This process generated values for the ‘master variables’ and ‘calculated variables’ in <b>mission</b> <b>statements.</b> Content analysis revealed that while a significant number of enterprises scored zero for the calculated variable ‘insistence’, only a few had scores within range. Most enterprises scored considerably well in the master variable ‘activity’. In ‘optimism’ social and corporate enterprises show some noticeable differences in their purpose, which reflect how different these organizations are. This content analysis succeeds in reflecting where the social and corporate enterprises in India’s renewable energy sector differ in their strategic intent. While in renewable energy social enterprises there is a domination of reference to beneficiaries/communities in their <b>mission</b> <b>statements,</b> and the positive entailments in terms of social change; renewable energy corporate enterprises seem to have a stronger intent to focus on issues related to technology, innovation, efficiency, and cost-leadership. Thus, this paper not only adds to establishing the fact that <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> do play an important role in reflecting the strategic purpose of the organization, but adds to the arguments on the difference between social and commercial entrepreneurship.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the central}} {{concepts}} for the identity of any organization, especially nonprofit organizations is organizational mission. Mission {{is known as the}} “core purpose (DeLone, 2007) of the organization and as the answer to the collective question of “why are we here? ” (Fairhurst, Jordan, & Neuwirth, 1997). The centrality of mission and the nearly universal development of <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> in NPOs (Kirk & Nolan, 2010) demonstrate the importance of <b>mission</b> and <b>mission</b> <b>statements.</b> In this essay, I contend that <b>mission</b> and <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> are currently conflated constructs; the connection of communication to <b>mission</b> (beyond <b>mission</b> <b>statements)</b> needs further development; and the communicative enactment of mission is of important theoretical value. I offer a structurational view of <b>mission</b> and <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> as a means of meeting each of these needs. When studying organizations, understanding their purposes can be an interesting challenge. In the case of for-profit organizations, the central questions of purpose is often claimed to be the generation of profits for shareholders. However, one {{of the central}} features of nonprofit organizations is that they must have a mission that centers on a public benefit (Salomon, 1999). In fact as Lewis (2005) indicates...|$|R

Further, tribal colleges' curricula did not emphasize economic concepts as the <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> indicated. A particular finding suggests that tribal colleges' are investing in environmental studies programs, thus increasing their intellectual capacity to protect their environmental interests while promoting indigenous thinking and community learning across all academic disciplines. Considerable implications include that an increase of American Indian environmental studies graduates may {{have a positive impact on}} environmental justice matters as well as the ability to promote new agricultural technologies. Additional implications include how mainstream universities will adapt to an increase of native students studying the sciences rather than liberal arts...|$|R
