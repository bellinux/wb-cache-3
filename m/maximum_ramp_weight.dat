50|$|Manufacturers are {{required}} to calculate ACNs for new aircraft as they come into service and publish the results in flight manuals. The tables give ACN values for two weights, one at the maximum total weight authorized and the other at the operating weight when empty. If an aircraft is operating at an intermediate weight, the ACN value can be calculated by a linear variation between the limits. Extrapolation is not permissible. ACN is calculated {{with respect to the}} center of gravity position, which yields the critical loading on the critical gear. Normally, the aftmost center of gravity, or CG position, appropriate to the <b>maximum</b> gross apron (<b>ramp)</b> mass, or <b>ramp</b> <b>weight,</b> is used to calculate the ACN.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{long-term}} operation of price-taker peak hydropower plants associated to reservoirs {{and subject to}} minimum flows and <b>maximum</b> <b>ramping</b> rates that sell energy in day-ahead electricity markets. The thesis is organised in five chapters and two appendixes. The first chapter is an introduction of the above-mentioned issue. It aims to provide both an overview {{as well as a}} mathematical description of the addressed problem and define the scope and objectives of the thesis. The second chapter shows {{a review of the literature}} related to the main topics tackled in the thesis, such as the principal approaches of reservoir decision support tools, the optimisation techniques most used in hydro scheduling, the main procedures for the characterisation of the involved random inputs and the methods most employed to estimate the generation characteristic of a peak hydropower plant. Furthermore, the chapter also presents a brief description of the hydro scheduling models that have considered minimum flows and <b>maximum</b> <b>ramping</b> rates jointly. The third and the fourth chapters are devoted to the achievement of the thesis objectives and are divided in several studies. Among the main contributions cointaned in these studies can be found different long-term optimisation models for hydropeaking subject to minimum flows and <b>maximum</b> <b>ramping</b> rates, several sensitivity analyses of the long-term effects of these constraints on certain economical and operational aspects of a peak hydropower plant, a set of formulae for the approximate assessment of the long-term economic impact caused by these constraints on this type of plants, and the introduction of a new concept in hydro scheduling: flow value. The fith chapter sets out the conclusions of the thesis which can be summarised as follows. On the one hand, the presence of minimum flows in hydropeaking increases the spillage volume and the water value, whereas decreases the generated energy, the number of start-ups and shut-downs of the hydro units, the plant capability for price tracking and the revenue. On the other hand, the presence of <b>maximum</b> <b>ramping</b> rates, in turn, increases the number of plant operating hours, the spillage volume, and, in the driest weeks, the flow value, whereas decreases the number of start-ups and shut-downs of the hydro units, the plant capability for price tracking, the revenue, the water value, and, in the wettest weeks, the flow value. The appendix A contains the equations involved in the developed optimisation models and the appendix B provides a summary of the main data of the case studies considered in the third and fourth chapters. Finally, both the cited references and the applied nomenclature can be found at the end of the thesis...|$|R

40|$|Recurrent {{congestion}} {{caused by}} high commuter traffic is an irritation to motorway users. Ramp metering (RM) {{is the most}} effective motorway control means (M Papageorgiou & Kotsialos, 2002) for significantly reducing motorway congestion. However, given field constraints (e. g. limited <b>ramp</b> space and <b>maximum</b> <b>ramp</b> waiting time), RM cannot eliminate recurrent congestion during the increased long peak hours. This paper, therefore, focuses on rapid congestion recovery to further improve RM systems: that is, to quickly clear congestion in recovery periods. The feasibility of using RM for recovery is analyzed, and a zone recovery strategy (ZRS) for RM is proposed. Note that this study assumes no incident and demand management involved, i. e. no re-routing behavior and strategy considered.

40|$|A new coordinated, traffic-responsive ramp {{metering}} algorithm {{has been designed}} for Minnesota’s freeways based on density measurements, rather than flows. This is motivated in view of recent research indicating that the critical value of density at which capacity is observed is less sensitive and more stable than the value of capacity, thereby resulting in m ore effective control. Firstly, we develop a methodology to estimate densities with space and time {{based on data from}} loop detectors. The methodology is based on solving a flow conservation differential equation (using LWR theory) with intermediate (internal) freeway mainline boundaries, which is fast er and more accurate from previous resear ch using only external boundaries. To capture the capacity drop phenomenon into the first-order model we utilize a fundamental diagram with two values of capacity and we provide a memory-based methodology to choose the appropriate value in the numerical solution of the problem. Secondly, with respect to {{ramp metering}}, the main goals of the algorithm are to delay the onset of the breakdown and to accelerate system recovery when ramp metering is unable due to the violation of <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>ramp</b> waiting time. The effectiveness of the new control strategy is being assessed by comparison with the currently deployed version of the Stratified Zone Algorithm (SZM) through microscopic simulation of a real 12 -mile, 17 ramp freeway section.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIHydrologic {{alteration}} due to hydropeaking reservoir {{operations is}} a main concern worldwide. Subdaily environmental flow constraints (ECs) on operations can be promising alternatives for mitigating negative impacts. However, those constraints reduce {{the flexibility of}} hydropower plants, potentially with higher costs for the power system. To study the economic and environmental efficiency of ECs, this work proposes a novel framework comprising four steps: (i) assessment of the current subdaily hydrologic alteration; (ii) formulation and implementation of a short-term, grid-wide hydrothermal coordination model; (iii) design of ECs {{in the form of}} <b>maximum</b> <b>ramping</b> rates (MRRs) and minimum flows (MIFs) for selected hydropower reservoirs; and (iv) identification of Pareto-efficient solutions in terms of grid-wide costs and the Richard-Baker flashiness index for subdaily hydrologic alteration (SDHA). The framework was applied to Chile's main power grid, assessing 25 EC cases, involving five MIFs and five MRRs. Each case was run for a dry, normal, and wet water year type. Three Pareto-efficient ECs are found, with remarkably small cost increase below 2 % and a SDHA improvement between 28 % and 90 %. While the case involving the highest MIF worsens the flashiness of another basin, the other two have no negative effect on other basins and can be recommended for implementation.
