5000|$|As Secretary of the Interior, in 1985, Hodel {{ordered the}} {{acquisition}} of a ranch in southern Arizona which would become the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge.

40|$|There can {{be little}} doubt that the grouse and quail provide the most {{important}} and most popular targets for more than ten million small-game hunters every year in North America (National survey, 1965). In much of the southeast, to go 2 ̆ 2 bird 2 ̆ 2 hunting simply means a day in pursuit of bobwhites, and likewise in New England 2 ̆ 2 pa 2 ̆ 7 tridge 2 ̆ 2 hunting is regarded as the premier sport of all upland game hunting. These two species, the bobwhite and ruffed grouse, in 1970 were hunted in forty-seven states and eight provinces and are without question the most important of all North American upland game species (table 27). Although neither species was hunted during 1970 in Arizona or South Dakota, both have been legal game in South Dakota in recent years, and <b>masked</b> <b>bobwhites</b> originally occurred in southern Arizona, where they are now being restocked. In addition, the bobwhite occurs over much of Mexico and is an important game species in that country. 	 In table 27 is presented a list of the grouse and quail occurring north of Mexico, as well as the states and provinces in which they could legally be hunted during the 1970 – 71 hunting season, based on information available to the author. Of course, the length of the season and the daily limits varied greatly in different areas and in a few instances the total season lasted only a day or two. However, the list does provide a method of estimating the relative importance of the species as game. On this basis alone, the ruffed grouse might be judged most important, while the bobwhite is almost as widely hunted. Other species that are currently hunted in ten or more states and provinces are the sage grouse, blue grouse, spruce grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, chukar partridge, and gray partridge...|$|R
50|$|There are 21 {{subspecies}} {{of northern}} bobwhite, {{many of which}} are hunted extensively as game birds. One subspecies, the <b>masked</b> <b>bobwhite</b> (Colinus virginianus ridgwayi), is listed as endangered with wild populations located in the northern Mexican state of Sonora and a reintroduced population in Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge in southern Arizona.|$|E
50|$|The semidesert {{grassland}} {{supports the}} reintroduction of <b>masked</b> <b>bobwhite</b> quail and pronghorns. Prescribed and natural fires {{play a major}} role in maintaining and restoring the sea of grass that once filled the Altar Valley. Riparian (wetland) areas along Arivaca Cienega and Arivaca Creek attract an abundance of birds. Brown Canyon, to the west of the Arivaca Creek area, is nestled in the Baboquivari Mountains, where a sycamore-lined stream meanders through oak woodland.|$|E
40|$|Home range, habitat use, and {{movements}} of reintroduced <b>masked</b> <b>bobwhite</b> (Colinus virginianus ridgewayi) were studied during 1986 - 88 on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge in southern Arizona. Home ranges averaged 10. 9 ha (5. 2 - 14. 6 ha), and core areas averaged 1. 1 ha (0. 2 - 2. 7 ha). Core areas {{had significantly higher}} visual obstruction by vegetation from 0 - 1 dm, aerial and basal grass cover, and significantly lower bare ground, litter, half-shrub cover, half shrub density, and visual obstruction by vegetation from 5 - 20 dm than non-core areas. The majority of the <b>masked</b> <b>bobwhite</b> moved less than 1 km between their release location and the site of first trapping. However, some long distance movements occurred. Once home ranges were established, <b>masked</b> <b>bobwhite</b> seldom left the boundaries.

40|$|Masked bobwhites used {{sites with}} more {{structural}} diversity {{than what was}} available on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge during 1994 - 96. Selected habitat variables that adequately predicted habitat use by masked bobwhites included percent herbaceous canopy cover, structure at 15 cm and 2 m, forb richness, and season. <b>Masked</b> <b>bobwhite</b> used more structural diversity than Gambel's and scaled quail. Gambel's quail had broader habitat tolerances than either <b>masked</b> <b>bobwhite</b> or scaled quail. Selected habitat variables that revealed differences among masked bobwhites, Gambel's quail, and scaled quail included percent woody canopy cover, structure at 15 cm, forb richness, and season.

30|$|If {{restoration}} of original conditions {{does not happen}} naturally, however, this has not prevented the implementation of regulatory policies that tacitly presuppose the contrary. For {{as long as the}} Endangered Species Act has been in effect, the listing of species has been attended by calls for the reduction or elimination of livestock grazing on southwestern rangelands. Until recently, federal agencies, environmental NGOs, and many scientists adhered to a common model for endangered species conservation in the region: find the best habitat and protect it by removing human commercial activities which almost always includes livestock grazing. Examples abound, especially among birds (e.g., <b>Masked</b> <b>Bobwhite</b> Quail, Southwestern Willow Flycatcher, and Cactus Ferruginous Pygmy Owl) and fish (e.g., Gila topminnow, Gila chub, and Yaqui chub).|$|E
30|$|This {{history is}} profoundly {{important}} {{to issues of}} wildlife and pastoralism in the Southwest {{up to the present}} day, but not in obvious or straightforward ways. Wildlife populations were undoubtedly affected by the environmental changes of the late nineteenth century but with one partial exception, the <b>Masked</b> <b>Bobwhite</b> Quail (Sayre 2002), none were extirpated by grazing impacts. Large predators were subsequently hunted to regional extinction, including the jaguar, Mexican gray wolf and grizzly bear, and some important small mammals, such as the black-tailed prairie dog, were persecuted as pests and dramatically reduced in range and numbers (Oakes 2000). Hunting pressure and habitat changes also reduced populations of game species such as deer, pronghorn, and bighorn sheep. The impacts of regional environmental change on wildlife were otherwise indirect, incomplete, and of difficult attribution, particularly with regard to livestock.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [54]- 58) The major {{histocompatibility complex}} (Mhc) {{is a group of}} genetic loci containing genes which code for cell surface molecules whose function is to provide a context for antigen presentation to T lymphocytes. The Mhc has been identified in all vertebrates studied including 4 species of birds: the chicken, the ring-necked pheasant, the sandhill crane and the Bengalese finch. Based on this information, it has become apparent that the organization of the avian Mhc is substantially {{different from that of the}} mammal Mhc. The chicken Mhc is by far the best understood of the avian species and the characterization of the Mhc of non-chicken avian species is necessary to answering evolutionary questions about the divergence of birds and mammals. The Mhc has been shown in chickens and various mammal species to be associated with disease resistance, livability, productivity and mate selection. These associations between Mhc haplotypes and certain aspects of fitness suggest that genetic characterization of the Mhc may be important in captive breeding programs of endangered species. Because of the protected status of endangered species, it is often difficult to use these animals in invasive research and thus the use of closely related species as models may be appropriate. This study involved the genetic characterization of the Mhc of the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). The goal was to characterize the haplotypes of the northern bobwhite Mhc using alloantisera created in the northern bobwhite. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was used to confirm that the identified blood group system was the Mhc. These alloantisera would later be used to identify Mhc haplotypes of a subspecies, the <b>masked</b> <b>bobwhite</b> (Colinus virginianus ridgwayi) which is endemic to the U. S. desert southwest (results of this work are now in press). At least 12 Mhc haplotypes were identified in this population of northern bobwhites using a combination of both alloantisera and RFLP. M.

The beta 2 M and the BF 19 and BF 21 class I MHC genes of the chicken have been cloned and sequenced. These genes were inserted into pIZ/V 5 -His (beta 2 M) and pIB/V 5 -His (BF 19 or BF 21) expression vectors and High Five insect cells were transfected producing two recombinant cell lines: H 5 -BF 19 and H 5 -BF 21. The BF 19 and BF 21 class I MHC alleles were expressed on these insect cell lines. H 5 -BF 19 produced anti-BF 19 and H 5 -BF 21 produced anti-BF 21 antibodies when injected into a BF 2 / 2 chicken. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence analysis, conventional anti-BF 19 and anti-BF 21 antisera specifically stained the H 5 -BF 19 and H 5 -BF 21 cell lines. Due to the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum transport found in vertebrate cells, the H 5 -BF 19 and H 5 -BF 21 insect cell lines do not insert peptide epitopes into class I MHC glycoproteins that are expressed on the surface of insect cells. Incubation of H 5 -BF 19 cells with nine-amino-acid peptides, derived from the sequence of the glycoprotein B gene of Marek's disease virus, stabilized the BF 19 class I glycoprotein and increased surface expression on the H 5 -BF 19 cell line as measured by immunofluorescence. The H 5 -BF 19 insect cells were loaded with three different glycoprotein B epitopes and were incubated with cytotoxic T lymphocytes produced to glycoprotein B. H 5 -BF 19 cells, loaded with peptide 1 (GRRVAAKML), were specifically killed by anti-glycoprotein B CTL. During the cloning and sequencing of the BF 19 and BF 21 class I MHC alleles, a new class I MHC sequence designated BF 21 P was discovered. Comparison of BF 21 P with known MHC class I allele sequences indicates BF 21 P has 80 to 85 % sequence homology with BF 19 and BF 21. BF 21 P cDNA contains a number of insertions that produce three internal stop codons and is designated a pseudogene. PCR primers specific for BF 21 P were designed and used for genetic analysis of the Briles chicken lines maintained at Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois. The data indicate that the BF 21 P locus is located on chromosome 16 closely linked to the BF 21 allele. Furthermore, the BF 21 P sequence is not found in the pheasant, northern bobwhite, or <b>masked</b> <b>bobwhite</b> species...|$|E
