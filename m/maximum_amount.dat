5|$|Due to the {{configuration}} of the Circuit de Monaco, with its low average speed and abundance of low-speed corners, allied to the low-grip nature of the public road surface, the teams all set their cars up to produce the <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> of downforce and mechanical grip possible. Benetton modified their car's suspensions to work better on the circuit's low-speed corners. The Minardi cars came equipped with a new titanium cast gearbox and new rear suspensions. McLaren brought an additional spare car to the event, with four in total being shared between Häkkinen and Coulthard.|$|E

40|$|Aim. To {{determine}} {{the concentrations of}} cadmium, lead, mercury, and metalloid arsenic in the samples of some dietetic products marketed in Croatia, and to compare the values obtained with <b>maximum</b> allowed <b>amounts</b> (MAA) according to the law. Methods. Metal and metalloid concentrations were measured in 30 dietetic products from the group of industrial food supplements and food additives. The measurements were performed by the method of atomic absorption spectrometry. The concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic were compared with the <b>maximum</b> allowed <b>amounts</b> for these substances in corn and corn products, and their estimated daily intake with {{the recommendations of the}} World Health Organization. Results. Two out of 30 samples contained cadmium, 5 samples contained lead, and as many as 16 samples contained mercury in concentrations exceeding <b>maximum</b> allowed <b>amounts.</b> The concentration of arsenic was below <b>maximum</b> allowed <b>amount</b> in all samples. In total, the concentrations of metals exceeding <b>maximum</b> allowed <b>amount</b> were found in 17 out of 30 samples. Extremely high contamination with heavy metals was detected in a sample based on zinc oxide, in which the concentration of cadmium (0. 418 mg/kg) was four times higher than the <b>maximum</b> allowed <b>amount,</b> and of lead (6. 074 mg/kg) 15 times higher than the <b>maximum</b> allowed <b>amount.</b> The highest concentration of mercury (1. 117 mg/kg), 35 -fold <b>maximum</b> allowed <b>amount,</b> was found in a ginseng-based sample. Conclusions. Cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic were present in some dietetic products in concentrations exceeding <b>maximum</b> allowed <b>amounts.</b> Dietetic products control should match respective legal provisions of the European Union requirements, and requires continual monitoring...|$|R

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the lockout, {{a higher percentage of}} players signed contracts worth the <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> possible under the cap. Some young players, such as LeBron James, began signing shorter contracts that allowed for more flexibility in team choice and salary. The agreement expired in 2005, and both sides became concerned about the possibility of another work stoppage. A lockout was prevented, however, when a six-year CBA was reached in June 2005. After the expiration of that CBA, a lockout occurred in 2011; it was the fourth in league history and lasted for about five months before the sides came to an agreement. Each team's schedule in the 2011–12 NBA season was cut by 16 games.|$|E
5|$|The tax {{increase}} was implemented {{not only to}} improve accessibility and the environment, but also to help develop the infrastructure. The additional funds will contribute to finance {{the extension of the}} Stockholm metro. As the Stockholm congestion tax varies by time of the day, the highest increase took place at the two busiest rush hour periods, 7:30 to 8:29, and 16:00 to 17:29, from SEK 20 to SEK 30. The objective was to steer the traffic towards other times of the day and public transport, and in this way reduce congestion in the Inner City area. Also the <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> levied was raised to SEK 105 per day and vehicle.|$|E
5|$|A microbrewery, or craft brewery, {{produces}} {{a limited amount}} of beer. The <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> of beer a brewery can produce and still be classed as a microbrewery varies by region and by authority, though is usually around 15,000 barrels (1.8 megalitres, 396 thousand imperial gallons or 475 thousand US gallons) a year. A brewpub is a type of microbrewery that incorporates a pub or other eating establishment. The highest density of breweries in the world, most of them microbreweries, exists in the German Region of Franconia, especially in the district of Upper Franconia, which has about 200 breweries. The Benedictine Weihenstephan Brewery in Bavaria, Germany, can trace its roots to the year 768, as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. The brewery was licensed by the City of Freising in 1040, and therefore is the oldest working brewery in the world.|$|E

5|$|In Mexico, Hurricane Erika {{primarily}} {{affected the}} states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León, but also had effects on Coahuila as well. Rainfall peaked at 6.71inches (170.5mm) in Magueyes in Tamaulipas. Several other locations reported over 3inches (76mm), including 4.02inches (102mm) in Cerro Prieto, which was the <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> {{in the state of}} Nuevo León, and 3.42inches (86.8mm) in Monterrey, where 30people were injured. Sustained winds peaked at 40mph (65km/h) in San Fernando, where a gust of 65mph (105km/h) was also reported. The heavy rainfall resulted in severe flooding and mudslides, blocking several highways in northeastern Mexico. In Matamoros, the storm damaged roofs and cars. Moderate winds snapped tree branches and spread debris across roads, though locals considered the storm minor. In the Nuevo León city of Montemorelos, two people died when they were swept away after they drove their truck across a partially flooded bridge. Throughout Mexico, 20,000people were left without power due to the storm. The remnant circulation produced heavy amounts of precipitation in western Mexico and Baja California.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{damage was}} {{generally}} minor. There were {{no reports of}} wind damage, although tropical storm-force winds affected the northern coast of Tamaulipas. A newspaper in Mexico reported up to 24inches (600mm) of precipitation across much of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon; this figure is in dispute, however, as the rainfall database maintained by Mexico's National Weather Service shows the <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> to lie under 20inches (508mm). The heavy rainfall from the storm filled nearly half the reservoirs in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, which were almost empty due to drought conditions in the region. As a result, dozens in southern Nuevo Leon were forced to evacuation their homes. Rains from Gabrielle flooded streets and destroyed bridges and highways in northern Mexico. No storm surge recordings were taken in Mexico, although it is estimated by the National Hurricane Center that a surge of a few feet took place {{to the north of}} the track. Six fatalities were reported in Mexico as a result of Gabrielle.|$|E

5|$|Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers, found {{throughout}} the game in unmarked chests (white chests in Ascension), increase the <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> of health and magic, respectively. Minotaur Horns, which increase the Items and Fire meter's maximum length, are available in God of War III and Ghost of Sparta, respectively. The Items meter allows the use of secondary weapons, called Items, and the Fire meter allows the use of Thera's Bane. The meters are increased in increments and reach their maximum once {{a certain number of}} Eyes, Feathers, and Horns are found. Other chests contain green, blue, or red orbs. Green orbs replenish the player's health, blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic for new, more powerful attacks, and replenish the Rage meter in God of War. Gold orbs found in God of War II and Ascension, and white orbs in God of War III, replenish the Rage meter instead of red orbs; the Rage meter in Ascension is also refilled by landing attacks on foes. Chests with changing colors, which allow players to choose which meter to replenish, have also been available. Red orbs can also be collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. Bosses and more powerful opponents release a combination of colored orbs when killed via the quick-time feature.|$|E
5|$|The gharial has {{undergone}} a chronic long-term decline, combined with a rapid short-term decline, leading the IUCN to list the species as critically endangered. In 1946, the gharial population had been widespread, numbering around 5,000 to 10,000; by 2006, however, it had declined 96–98%, reduced to {{a small number of}} widely spaced subpopulations of fewer than 235 individuals. This long-term decline had a number of causes, including egg collection and hunting, such as for indigenous medicine. The rapid decline of about 58% between 1997 and 2006 was caused by increasing use of gill nets and the loss of riverine habitat. The gharial population continues to be threatened by environmental hazards such as heavy metals and protozoan parasites, but as of 2013 numbers are rising, due to the protection of nests against egg predators. The Chinese alligator was historically widespread throughout the eastern Yangtze River system but is currently restricted to some areas in southeastern Anhui province thanks to habitat fragmentation and degradation. The wild population is believed to exist only in small fragmented ponds. In 1972, the species was declared a Class I endangered species by the Chinese government and received the <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> of legal protection. Since 1979, captive breeding programs were established in China and North America, creating a healthy captive population. In 2008, alligators bred in the Bronx Zoo were successfully reintroduced to Chongming Island. The Philippine crocodile is perhaps the most threatened crocodilian and is considered by the IUCN to be critically endangered. Hunting and destructive fishing habits have reduced its population to around 100 individuals by 2009. In the same year, 50 captive bred crocodiles were released into the wild to help boost the population. Support from local people is crucial for the species survival.|$|E
