5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 <b>minutes).</b> <b>A</b> transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E

5|$|After going {{pointless}} in {{nine games}} early the following season, the Stars waived Malhotra on November 19, 2003. Two days later, {{he was picked}} up by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Malhotra improved with the Blue Jackets, notching 12 goals and 25 points over 56 games following the trade. He missed the final six games of the regular season with a bruised ankle. His ice time rose from an average of nine <b>minutes</b> <b>a</b> game with Dallas the previous season to 14 minutes in Columbus.|$|E
5|$|Another {{story of}} the poem's origin claimed that Helmer's funeral was held {{on the morning of}} May 2, after which McCrae wrote the poem in 20 <b>minutes.</b> <b>A</b> third claim, by Morrison, was that McCrae worked on the poem as time allowed between arrivals of wounded {{soldiers}} in need of medical attention. Regardless of its true origin, McCrae worked on the poem for months before considering it ready for publication. He submitted it to The Spectator in London but it was rejected. It was then sent to Punch, where it was published on December 8, 1915. It was published anonymously, but Punch attributed the poem to McCrae in its year-end index.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more than}} a few <b>minutes</b> <b>a</b> day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E

5|$|Danner's {{physical}} strength extends to his legs, {{allowing him to}} leap great heights and distances. At age 10 he can leap 40 {{feet into the air}} and run faster than a train. During his freshman year in college, he easily breaks a world track record, though he actually doesn't run at his full speed. While {{in the service of the}} French Foreign Legion in World War I, he traverses thirty-seven miles round trip in just thirty <b>minutes</b> (<b>a</b> speed of about 148mph); all while carrying 2,000 pounds of food, water, and ammunition for his unit. Despite his great strength, he is still susceptible to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|In April 1868, the Metropolitan & St John's Wood Railway (M) {{opened a}} {{single-track}} railway in tunnel to Swiss Cottage from new platforms at Baker Street (called Baker Street East). There were intermediate stations at St John's Wood Road and Marlborough Road, both with crossing loops, {{and the line}} was worked by the Met with a train every 20 <b>minutes.</b> <b>A</b> junction was built with the Inner Circle at Baker Street, {{but there were no}} through trains after 1869.|$|E
5|$|In {{his rookie}} season, Nash only managed 10.5 <b>minutes</b> <b>a</b> game, {{but in his}} second season, his playing time {{increased}} significantly and he was even ranked 13th in the league for three-point field-goal percentage. Nevertheless, the Canadian's tenure with the Suns did not last. Nelson had just taken a job as assistant {{general manager of the}} Dallas Mavericks under his father, Don Nelson, and convinced him to acquire the under-utilised Nash. Following the 1998 NBA draft, Nash was traded from the Suns to the Mavericks in exchange for Martin Müürsepp, Bubba Wells, the draft rights to Pat Garrity and a first-round draft pick (who later turned out to be future Phoenix teammate Shawn Marion).|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} league match of 1998, Overmars scored twice to earn Arsenal a win against Leeds United. A week later the team drew 2–2 at Coventry City, losing more {{ground at the}} top of the table. January came to a {{conclusion}} with a 3–0 victory over Southampton, with all three goals scored in the space of seven <b>minutes.</b> <b>A</b> further two wins in February, at home to Chelsea and Crystal Palace, moved Arsenal into second place, nine points behind Manchester United, albeit having played two games less.|$|E
5|$|Mike Summerbee {{opened the}} scoring on 13 minutes, but Newcastle soon equalised. Neil Young made it 2–1, but again Newcastle equalised. A second strike by Young was {{disallowed}} for offside, and at half-time {{the score was}} 2–2. Straight after half-time Young scored again, and Francis Lee scored a fourth on 63 <b>minutes.</b> <b>A</b> late Newcastle goal set up a nervy finish, but City held on to win 4–3 and secure the title. The win was compounded by a 2–1 victory by Sunderland over Manchester United, giving City the title. Liverpool won one of their remaining games but lost the other, missing their chance to leapfrog United into second by one point.|$|E
5|$|More {{than four}} months after the attack, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} on August 20, 2007, that Cho had been diagnosed with selective mutism. The Virginia Tech Review Panel report, also released in August 2007, placed this diagnosis in the spring of Cho's eighth-grade year, and his parents sought treatment for him through medication and therapy. In high school, Cho was placed in special education under the 'emotional disturbance' classification. He was excused from oral presentations and participation in class conversation and received 50 <b>minutes</b> <b>a</b> month of speech therapy. He continued receiving mental health therapy as well until his junior year, when Cho rejected further therapy.|$|E

5|$|The Giants {{received}} {{the second half}} kickoff and mounted a record-setting drive. The opening drive ran for over 9 <b>minutes</b> (<b>a</b> Super Bowl record) and culminated in a 1-yard touchdown run by Ottis Anderson, giving the Giants a 17–12 lead. The signature play of the drive came on a third down play, when Giants receiver Mark Ingram appeared about to be tackled well short of a first down. However, Ingram evaded several tacklers, and dragged one defender just {{enough to get the}} Giants the first down, and kept the drive alive. By this time, the Giants strategy to handle the Bills offense had become clear: keep them off the field. Indeed, the Giants two touchdown drives consumed over 17 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{received}} the second-half kickoff and mounted a drive {{during which they}} converted on five third-down plays {{over the course of}} more than nine <b>minutes</b> (<b>a</b> Super Bowl record) and scored on a one-yard touchdown run by Ottis Anderson, giving the Giants a 17–12 lead. The signature play of the drive came on a third-down play, when Giants receiver Mark Ingram appeared about to be tackled well short of a first down. However, Ingram evaded several tacklers, dragging one defender in the process, to gain just enough yards for a first down. The Giants' strategy to handle the Bills' potent offense had become clear: keep them off the field. The Giants' two touchdown drives consumed over 17 minutes.|$|E
