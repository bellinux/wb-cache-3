5|$|EdwardIII was a temperamental man but {{capable of}} unusual clemency. He was in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> {{conventional}} king whose main interest was warfare. Admired {{in his own}} time and for centuries after, Edward was denounced as an irresponsible adventurer by later Whig historians such as William Stubbs. This view has been challenged recently and modern historians credit him with some significant achievements.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, Brussels was still in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> medieval city. The royal quarter in the upper town, inhabited mainly by the nobility and the richer members of the bourgeoisie, was upscale and modern. The rest of the city, however, in particular the lower town, located in the western half of the Pentagon, was densely populated and industrial, characterized by an illogical street layout, back alleys, narrow streets, and numerous dead ends.|$|E
5|$|Ravel drew on {{many generations}} of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Fauré {{and the more}} recent {{innovations}} of Satie and Debussy. Foreign influences include Mozart, Schubert, Liszt and Chopin. He considered himself in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> classicist, often using traditional structures and forms, such as the ternary, to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies. The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata.|$|E

5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E
5|$|In World War II, Southern Rhodesia again enthusiastically {{stood behind}} the UK, symbolically declaring war on Germany in support of Britain before any other colony or dominion. Over 26,000 Southern Rhodesians served in the Second World War, making the colony once more the largest {{contributor}} of manpower, proportional to white population, {{in all of the}} British Empire and Commonwealth. As in World War I, Southern Rhodesians were distributed in small groups throughout the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Dedicated Rhodesian platoons again served in the KRRC, and the Rhodesian African Rifles, raised in 1940, were in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> resurrection of the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Military aviation, already associated with the colony following the First World War, became a great Southern Rhodesian tradition during the Second, with the colony providing No. 44, No. 237 and No. 266 Squadrons and other personnel to the Royal Air Force, as well as training in Southern Rhodesia for 8,235 Allied airmen.|$|E
5|$|Schlosberg's contribution, is, in <b>many</b> <b>ways,</b> <b>a</b> {{response}} to challenges made to his Defining Environmental Justice (2007). Schlosberg aims to step beyond previous accounts of animal rights or environmentalism as requirements of justice by deploying a mixed capabilities/deliberation approach applicable to both ecosystems and nonhuman animals. Schlosberg challenges criticisms of his capabilities approach (specifically, a capabilities approach which moves beyond humans) {{grounded in the}} existence of conflicts of capabilities, claiming that a form of deliberative democracy can overcome the problem posed by these conflicts. His mixed account, he claims, provides a form of justice appropriate for thinking about human and nonhuman individuals and collectives in the Anthropocene.|$|E

50|$|The Tower of London {{has been}} {{represented}} {{in popular culture}} in <b>many</b> <b>ways.</b> <b>As</b> a result of 16th and 19th century writers, the Tower {{has a reputation as}} a grim fortress, a place of torture and execution.|$|R
5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E
5|$|The Waleses made Sandringham House their {{preferred}} residence, with Marlborough House their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage was in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward {{did not give}} his wife {{as much attention as}} she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation. This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift. Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever. Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress Lillie Langtry; Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; humanitarian Agnes Keyser; and society matron Alice Keppel. Alexandra knew about most of these relationships, and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit the king as he lay dying. Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.|$|E
25|$|In 1860 Miskolc was {{connected}} by railway to Košice (then called Kassa, {{it was the}} other leading city of Northern Hungary and in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> rival of Miskolc), in 1870 the Miskolc-Pest line was ready, and in 1871 the Gömör line was built.|$|E

25|$|Epicurus {{emphasised}} friendship as {{an important}} ingredient of happiness, and the school resembled in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> community of friends living together. However, he also instituted a hierarchical system of levels among his followers, and had them swear an oath on his core tenets.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{hired to}} teach design classes (in the College of Agriculture), it was Arneson who {{established}} the ceramic sculpture {{program for the}} Art Department. It was in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> bold and radical move, in that ceramics were not yet recognized as a medium appropriate for fine art at that time.|$|E
25|$|An {{outsider}} {{can watch}} a performance with real aesthetic involvement {{without knowing the}} language. The musical accompaniment by the gamelan is appealingly rich and complex.

25|$|Tuten's {{most recent}} novel, The Green Hour (2002), is in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> {{departure}} from the others. The setting is the present day, and the characters are not borrowed from history. Further, it lacks much of the impertinent humor and ethereal feel of his previous works. The story recounts the 30-year love affair between an academic and a spiritual vagabond.|$|E
25|$|The Communist {{began on}} 5 August 1920, {{just four days}} after the {{completion}} of the conference (the Congress of London) which founded the CPGB. The publication continued without interruption until its 131st issue, dated 3 February 1923. The paper was in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> direct continuation of The Call, retaining the same look and style, the same editor, and even continuing the serialization of articles begun in the earlier publication.|$|E
25|$|Sheepdogs {{resembling}} Berger Picards {{have been}} depicted for centuries in tapestries, engravings and woodcuts. One renowned painting, in the Bergerie Nationale at Rambouillet, the National Sheepfold of France, {{dating to the}} start of the 19th century, shows the 1st Master Shepherd, Clément Delorme, in the company of a medium-sized, strong-boned dog with mid-length crisp coat and naturally upright ears, resembling in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> Berger Picard of today.|$|E
50|$|Morihei Ueshiba {{developed}} aikido {{mainly from}} Daitō-ryū aiki-jūjutsu incorporating training movements {{such as those}} for the yari (spear), jō (a short quarterstaff), and perhaps also juken (bayonet).

25|$|Harris' {{first film}} {{role as an}} adult was 1995's Animal Room, {{although}} he portrayed a teenager. His subsequent film work has included supporting roles in The Next Best Thing, Undercover Brother, and Starship Troopers. Harris plays a fictionalized, hyper-womanising, lewd version of himself, in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> polar-opposite to his actual self, in the Harold and Kumar stoner comedy films Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, and A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas.|$|E
25|$|And {{by adding}} the {{population}} of western Scania to the same of Metropolitan area of Copenhagen, then close to 3 million people live around the Øresund sea, within a maximum distance from Øresund of 25 to 30 kilometres. At a land surface of approx. 6100km2 (approx 460 inhabitants/km2). This is in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> better measurement of describing the area around Øresund than what the far wider Øresund Region constitutes, as the latter includes also eastern Scania (whose beaches are Baltic Sea ones and is far less populated) as well as entire Denmark east of Great Belt.|$|E
25|$|Philip Sidney {{was central}} to Scott's {{conception}} of what poetry was and what it could achieve, and in the Model he cites Astrophel and Stella, the Arcadia and, of course, An Apology for Poetry. Gavin Alexander writes that The model of poesy is in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> commentary on The defence of poesy, adopting its basic theory, filling in its gaps, interrogating and weighing its sources, glossing and elaborating its difficulties. But {{it is also a}} very different sort of work, a much more ambitious and comprehensive exercise inspired by the Defence but not bounded or constrained by it' (p. liii).|$|E
50|$|Philip Hastane is {{a fictional}} author created by Clark Ashton Smith, in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>an</b> analog of his creator.
