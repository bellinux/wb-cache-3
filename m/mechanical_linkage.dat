5000|$|Vibration is {{undesirable}} in many domains, primarily engineered {{systems and}} habitable spaces, and {{methods have been}} developed to prevent the transfer of vibration to such systems. Vibrations propagate via mechanical waves and certain <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkages</b> conduct vibrations more efficiently than others. Passive vibration isolation makes use of materials and <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkages</b> that absorb and damp these mechanical waves. Active vibration isolation involves sensors and actuators that produce destructive interference that cancels-out incoming vibration.|$|R

25|$|Later hidden {{headlamps}} require {{one or more}} vacuum-operated servos and reservoirs, with associated {{plumbing and}} linkage, or electric motors, geartrains and linkages to raise the lamps to an exact position to assure correct aiming despite ice, snow and age. Some early hidden headlamps, such as those on the Saab Sonett III, used a lever-operated <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage</b> to raise the headlamps into position.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} {{to think of the}} Bricard octahedron as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage</b> consisting of the twelve edges, connected by flexible joints at the vertices, without the faces. Omitting the faces eliminates the self-crossings for many (but not all) positions of these octahedra. The resulting kinematic chain has one degree of freedom of motion, the same as the polyhedron from which it is derived.|$|E
25|$|Canon EF lenses, {{introduced}} in 1987, have electromagnetic diaphragms, {{eliminating the need}} for a <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage</b> between the camera and the lens, and allowing automatic aperture control with the Canon TS-E tilt/shift lenses. Nikon PC-E perspective-control lenses, {{introduced in}} 2008, also have electromagnetic diaphragms. Automatic aperture control is provided with the newer Nikon digital SLR cameras; with some earlier cameras, the lenses offer preset aperture control by means of a pushbutton that controls the electromagnetic diaphragm.|$|E

25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the Princess was {{designed}} to be operated by a pair of pilots, two flight engineers, a navigator, and a radio operator. Early on, it had been intended for the aircraft to be outfitted with some form of powered flight controls, including an early fly-by-wire implementation, in order that pilots would be able to effectively actuate its large control surfaces, which would have to overcome equally larger forces. However, it was decided to opt for a traditional <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage</b> approach that was augmented by a series of electrically-driven power assist units to effectively support actuation instead.|$|E
25|$|Baird's {{numerous}} other developments demonstrated his particular talent at invention. He was a visionary {{and began to}} dabble with electricity. In 1928, he developed an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision. The system consisted of a large Nipkow disk attached by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage</b> to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record and play back a 30-line video signal. Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, {{but some of the}} original phonodiscs have been preserved, and have since been restored by Donald McLean, a Scottish electrical engineer.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Lockheed Constellation L-049 {{aircraft}} allowed the pilots to disable the hydraulic elevator boost and control the elevators manually via direct <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage.</b> The pilots of the accident flight apparently attempted to revert to manual control as the aircraft began to pitch up, but the design was such that a continuous nose down pressure on the elevators made the shift to manual elevator control mechanically impossible. Thus, according to the CAB's reconstruction of events, as the pilots were desperately applying nose down pressure to avoid a stall, they were also hampering themselves from shifting to manual mode and regaining elevator control.|$|E

25|$|This uses {{low-voltage}} {{electricity to}} transmit {{the action of}} the organ keys to the pipes. Earlier church instruments used a <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage</b> of rods and wires to connect the keys to the pipes. With the new system, the console (also known as a key-desk) could be placed at virtually any distance from the organ's pipes and could be somewhat portable, as just an electrical cable and flexible wind line connected the console with other parts of the instrument. This also allowed the console to achieve its ubiquitous place—on an elevator platform in front of the stage, low in the orchestra pit for accompanying the film, and rising majestically to stage height for organ solos.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the field}} coils were {{connected}} to the antennae electrically, they could be placed anywhere, and their size was independent of the wavelength. This meant that RDF could now be performed on longest wavelengths with ease, using antennae of any size. For longwave use, the two crossed antennae could be easily built by running four wires from a single mast to the ground to form triangular shapes. When used with shorter wavelengths, the system of two crossed loop antennae {{proved to be more}} mechanically robust than a single rotating one. They had the added advantage that the antennae could be placed almost anywhere; earlier systems often included some sort of remote operation through a <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage,</b> but this limited the placement of the antenna or receiver room.|$|E

500|$|The {{airspeed}} indicator {{is connected to}} both the pitot and static pressure sources. [...] The difference between the pitot pressure and the static pressure is called dynamic pressure. The greater the dynamic pressure, the higher the airspeed reported. A traditional mechanical {{airspeed indicator}} contains a pressure diaphragm that {{is connected to the}} pitot tube. [...] The case around the diaphragm is airtight and is vented to the static port. [...] The higher the speed, the higher the ram pressure, the more pressure exerted on the diaphragm, and the larger the needle movement through the <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage.</b>|$|E
500|$|The variometer, {{also known}} as the {{vertical}} speed indicator (VSI) or the vertical velocity indicator (VVI), is the pitot-static instrument used {{to determine whether or not}} an aircraft is flying in level flight. [...] The vertical speed specifically shows the rate of climb or the rate of descent, which is measured in feet per minute or meters per second. [...] The vertical speed is measured through a <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage</b> to a diaphragm located within the instrument. [...] The area surrounding the diaphragm is vented to the static port through a calibrated leak (which also may be known as a [...] "restricted diffuser"). [...] When the aircraft begins to increase altitude, the diaphragm will begin to contract at a rate faster than that of the calibrated leak, causing the needle to show a positive vertical speed. [...] The reverse of this situation is true when an aircraft is descending. [...] The calibrated leak varies from model to model, but the average time for the diaphragm to equalize pressure is between 6 and 9 seconds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In budding yeast, we {{have found}} that sister rDNA arrays marked with {{fluorescent}} probes can be visualized as two distinguishable strands during metaphase. Upon ana-phase, these arm loci are drawn into the spindle, where they adopt a cruciform-like structure and stretch 2. 5 -fold as they migrate to the poles. Therefore, while sister rDNA arrays appear separated in metaphase, <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkages</b> between sister arm loci persist throughout anaphase in yeast, as shown in grasshopper spermatocytes (Paliulis and Nicklas 2004). These linkages are partially dependent on the protector of cohesin, SGO 1. In anaphase, the spatially regulated dissolution of these <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkages</b> serves to prevent premature sister separation and restrain the rate of spindle elongation. Thus, sister separation is temporally controlled and linkages between sister chromatids contribute to the regulation of anaphase spindle elongation...|$|R
2500|$|Early {{synchronized}} guns of the 1915–1917 period had {{a rate of}} fire in {{the region}} of 400 rounds per minute; at this comparatively leisurely rate of fire a synchronizer can be geared down and rendered fairly reliable. To control a faster gun, with (say) a cyclic rate of 800 or 1,000 rounds a minute, a gear had to work faster, making it more liable to failure. The intricate mechanism of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage</b> system, especially of the [...] "push rod" [...] type, tended to shake itself to pieces when driven at this sort of speed.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{thermodynamics}} textbooks {{describe a}} highly simplified form of Stirling cycle consisting of four processes. [...] This {{is known as}} an [...] "ideal Stirling cycle", {{because it is an}} [...] "idealized" [...] model, and not necessarily an optimized cycle. [...] Theoretically, the [...] "ideal cycle" [...] does have high net work output, but it is rarely used in practical applications, in part because other cycles are simpler or reduce peak stresses on bearings and other components. [...] For convenience, the designer may elect to use piston motions dictated by system dynamics, such as <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanisms. [...] At any rate, the efficiency and cycle power are nearly as good as an actual implementation of the idealized case.
