For manganese {{there was}} not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for Adequate Intakes (AIs). The current AIs for manganese for women and men ages 19 and up are 1.8 and 2.3 mg/day, respectively. AI for pregnancy is 2.0 mg/day. AI for lactation is 2.6 μg/day. For children ages 1–18 years the AI increases with age from 1.2 to 2.2 mg/day for males, to 1.6 mg/day for females. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of manganese the adult UL is set at 11 mg/day.

Objective: To assess the serum zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn) levelsin subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, Dhaka Medical College, Dhaka from July 2014 to June 2015. Fifty type 2 diabetic subjects with age ranging from 40 to 55 years of both sexes were study group and 50 age, sex and BMI matched healthy subjects were control group.

The effect of addition of organic amendments (piggery waste, biosolids, and commercial compost) and mineral amendments (unamended, seawater-neutralised residue mud, and carbonated bauxite residue mud) on Mn forms and availability in residue sand was studied. Incubation of residue sand with organic amendments (applied at rates of 0, 10, and 50 t/ha) over a 30 -day period found little change in DTPA-extractable Mn concentrations, which remained below the critical level of 1 mg/kg. The DTPA-extractable Mn concentrations were comparable to those in the exchangeable fraction (DTPA-Mn= 0. 931 ×Exch-Mn+ 0. 358, r 2 = 0. 84) and, therefore, may provide an estimation of plant-available Mn. The highest Mn concentrations were consistently associated with the carbonate fraction, suggesting that Mn was either retained by surface adsorption reactions and/or co-precipitated with calcium carbonate. The addition of residue mud amendments generally reduced DTPA-extractable Mn, probably through adsorption by hydrous Fe and Al oxides. Leaching did not cause significant (P> 0. 05) movement of Mn in residue sand columns, possibly due to the alkaline pH and specific adsorption reactions.

Barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotypes differ considerably in their ability to grow in soils with low Mn 2 + availability. Differential genotypic Mn efficiency can be attributed to differences in Mn 2 + uptake kinetics in the low nanomolar concentration range. However, the molecular basis for these differences has not yet been clarified. We present here the identification and characterization of the first barley gene encoding a plasma membrane-localized metal transport protein able to transport Mn 2 +. The gene is designated HvIRT 1 (for IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER 1) because it belongs to the ZIP gene family and has a high similarity to rice (Oryza sativa) OsIRT 1. A novel yeast uptake assay based on inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis of 31 different metal and metalloid ions showed that the HvIRT 1 protein, in addition to Mn 2 +, also transported Fe 2 +/Fe 3 +, Zn 2 +, and Cd 2 +. Both Mn and iron deficiency induced an up-regulation of HvIRT 1 in two barley genotypes differing in Mn efficiency, but the expression levels in all cases were highest (up to 40 %) in the Mn-efficient genotype.

Hydroponic culture studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of enhanced Zn nutrition on the mitigation of HLB-affected grapefruit seedlings. Modified Hoagland nutrient solutions were used with three Zn 2 + levels: 0, 1. 0, and 1. 5 times that of standard strength. Both HLB-affected and healthy grapefruit seedlings were subjected to the treatments for 49 days. During the growth period, photosynthesis of plant leaves was measured, and at day 49 of the culture, leaf tissues and cells were examined for structural changes using light and scanning electron microscopy. Enhanced Zn nutrition generally improved the growth of HLB plants with less symptom severity. Photosynthesis, in terms of leaf electron transfer rate and photochemical quantum yield, was enhanced. The wax layer and cuticle increased, and the epidermis cells became better organized, with a higher number of normal stomatal openings, compared to the control. In addition, enhanced Zn nutrition resulted in more developed xylem and phloem transport systems, resulting in reduced starch grains and polyphenol substances in the leaf cells. These results indicate that enhanced Zn nutrition can improve the structure of photosynthetic, transfusion and protective tissue systems, and thus promote photosynthesis, transport of photosynthates, and other related metabolism of HLB-infected citrus...|$|R
