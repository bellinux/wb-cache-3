50|$|Often, {{males and}} females will perform {{synchronized}} or responsive courtship displays in a mutual fashion. With many socially monogamous species such as birds, this duet facilitates pre-copulatory reassurance of pair bonding and strengthens post-copulatory dedication {{to the development of}} offspring (e.g. great crested grebe, Podiceps cristatus). For example, male and female crested auklets, Aethia cristatella, will cackle at one another as a vocal form of mutual display which serves to strengthen a bond between the two. In some cases, males may pair up to perform <b>mutual,</b> <b>cooperative</b> displays in order to increase courtship success and attract females. This phenomenon can be seen with long-tailed manakins, Chiroxiphia linearis.|$|E

A management framework based on contemporary principles is adapted to the combined need of satisfying continuing airworthiness requirements whilst maximising the value obtainable from continuing to operate a fleet of ageing aircraft. Combining these organisational considerations with the knowledge needs of operators of ageing aircraft is achieved by a strategy model that can be tailored to a particular operator’s circumstances.

40|$|Until about 25 years ago, {{almost all}} European {{countries}} had a so-called “three pillar” banking system comprising private banks, (public) savings banks and (<b>mutual)</b> <b>cooperative</b> banks. Since that time, several European countries have implemented far-reaching {{changes in their}} banking systems, which have {{more than anything else}} affected the two “pillars” of the savings and cooperative banks. The article describes the most important changes in Germany, Austria, France, Italy and Spain and characterizes the former and the current roles of savings banks and cooperative banks in these countries. A particular focus is placed on the German case, which is almost unique in so far as the German savings banks and cooperative banks have maintained most of their traditional features.

40|$|Abstract — As viruses {{become more}} complex, {{existing}} anti-virus methods are inefficient to detect {{various forms of}} viruses, especially new variants and unknown viruses. Inspired by immune system, a hierarchical artificial immune system (AIS) model, {{which is based on}} matching in three layers, is proposed to detect a variety of forms of viruses. In the bottom layer, a non-stochastic but guided candidate virus gene library is generated by statistical information of viral key codes. Then a detecting virus gene library is upgraded from the candidate virus gene library using negative selection. In the middle layer, a novel storage method is used to keep a potential relevance between different signatures on the individual level, by which the <b>mutual</b> <b>cooperative</b> information of each instruction in a virus program can be collected. In the top layer, an overall matching process can reduce the information loss consider-ably. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model can recognize obfuscated viruses efficiently with an averaged recognition rate of 94 %, including new variants of viruses and unknown viruses.

40|$|Autonomous {{vehicle is}} able to {{facilitate}} road safety and traffic efficiency {{and has become a}} promising trend of future development. With a focus on highways, existing literatures studied the feasibility of autonomous vehicle in continuous traffic flows and the controllability of cooperative driving. However, rare efforts have been made to investigate the traffic control strategies in autonomous vehicle environment on urban roads, especially in urban intersections. In autonomous vehicle environment, it is possible to achieve cooperative driving with V 2 V and V 2 I wireless communication. Without signal control, conflicted traffic flows could pass intersections through <b>mutual</b> <b>cooperative,</b> which is a remarkable improvement to existing traffic control methods. This paper established a cellular automata model with greedy algorithm for the traffic control of intersections in autonomous vehicle environment, with autonomous vehicle platoon as the optimization object. NetLogo multiagent simulation platform model was employed to simulate the proposed model. The simulation results are compared with the traffic control programs in conventional Synchro optimization. The findings suggest that, on the premises of ensuring traffic safety, the control strategy of the proposed model significantly reduces average delays and number of stops as well as increasing traffic capacity...|$|E

In contrast to findings in similar experiments, no differences in player's total cooperative plays, score nor <b>mutual</b> <b>cooperative</b> plays was found in this study. Yet, when anchored with pure altruistic strategies participants adopted nastier strategies than participants anchored with strategies for altruistic punishment.

In sum, human teenagers do not seem to get nicer by being told that it's in their best interest to be nice - rather the opposite...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the impact of}} the {{connections}} of the top executives (Presidents, CEOs and General Managers) of Italian banks on their turnover and on bank performance. We measure managers’ connections by the kilometer distance between the province of the bank's headquarter and the manager's province of birth. We show that top managers tend to be local {{in the sense that the}} distribution of this distance is heavily skewed towards zero. On the basis of this evidence we investigate whether connections affect the duration of the appointment at the bank, and whether connections entrench managers at the expense of the bank's performance. We find that connections generally decrease the probability of bank manager’s turnover, and that the positive effect of performance on tenure is strongly attenuated once connections are taken into account. Furthermore we find that for any bank type performance does not increase with connections. On the contrary, we show that having connected managers hurts performance in <b>Mutual,</b> <b>Cooperative</b> and Rural banks. Overall these findings suggest that connections are collusion devices to share and maintain rents at the expenses of bank performance...|$|E
