5|$|The {{wildlife}} on Ford Island {{is likely}} {{very similar to}} that on Naval Station Pearl Harbor. Wildlife is sparse and dominated by invasive species such as the house mouse, mongoose, brown rat, black rat, house sparrow, Java sparrow and common mynah. An endangered owl, the endemic pueo (a subspecies of the short-eared owl), has been seen hunting on the island. Nearly all the plant life on the island is non-native, including edible cacti from California introduced in the late 1700s by Francisco de Paula Marín. The island's harbor was important to ancient Hawaiians for its ample supply of fish, including mullet, <b>milkfish</b> and Hawaiian anchovy. The National Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service oversee and administer the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument battlefields at Pearl Harbor and Ford Island.|$|E

A state-funded agricultural research center was established in Xinhua District to ensure the market competitiveness of the crop. The headquarters of the World Vegetable Center, a NPO that aims to improve crop quality in poorer countries, is in Shanhua District.|$|E

Nasipit Port {{can serve as a}} secondary shipping hub to Cagayan de Oro when traffic volume from other points in Mindanao increases. With a roll-on, roll-off (RORO) ferry service now in place, Surigao City serves as a vital transportation link for trucks and buses bound for Luzon.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} whiting's {{similarity to}} all other species in the genus Sillago has led to many less abundant species being confused with it. The species is known to grow to a maximum size of 31cm, however reports dating back to 1850 in Bengal suggest the species attains 3 feet (91cm), {{which would make it}} the largest species of sillaginid. These reports were never etched into the literature on the species, possibly because of presumed confusion with the similar but unrelated and larger <b>milkfish</b> and bonefish that inhabit the area. The species has a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first made of feeble spines and the second of soft rays headed by a single feeble spine, while the ventral profile is straight.|$|E
25|$|The Ganges basin {{supports}} major fisheries, {{but these}} have declined in recent decades.

In the Patna region in the lower section of the basin, catches of carp fell from 383.2 metric tons to 118, and catfish from 373.8 metric tons to 194.48.

500|$|A Philippine {{national}} symbol will {{be considered}} official once it is declared through a law or a proclamation. [...] National symbols such as the cariñosa, carabao, bangus (<b>milkfish),</b> and anahaw (footstool palm) that are circulating through various sources have no official status and have not established by law. According to Nestor Castro, a Filipino cultural anthropologist, most of these unofficial symbols were passed on as tradition in schools every start {{of the school year}} when students were asked to buy posters containing the supposed national symbols. While official national symbols are declared through law, Castro and National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) Section Chief Teodoro Atienza considered that the public must be consulted first before declaration of national symbol.|$|E
