30|$|The ecologists, managers, {{and environmentalists}} of today, then, derive their {{understanding}} of California’s flora and fauna from the existing state but generally without acknowledging or understanding its engineered origins. Removal of pastoralism does not stimulate {{a return to a}} pristine state nor does it maintain the existing second state but, instead, creates an entirely new third state where the artifacts of engineering persist, but the engineering agent is removed. Again, removal causes a <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> flows, advantaging some species and disadvantaging others. Some of the species that have flourished in the engineered second state environment are lost as this new third state develops, and resource streams are altered. Ironically, studies are accumulating that show that a number of the state’s rare species are among those disadvantaged by this shift to a new third ecosystem state (Barry 2011).|$|R
40|$|Emotionally arousing stimuli {{are known}} to rapidly draw the brain's {{processing}} resources, {{even when they are}} task-irrelevant. The steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) response, a neural response to a flickering stimulus which effectively allows measurement <b>of</b> the processing <b>resources</b> devoted to that stimulus, has been used to examine this process of attentional shifting. Previous studies have used a task in which participants detected periods of coherent motion in flickering random dot kinematograms (RDKs) which generate an SSVEP, and found that task-irrelevant emotional stimuli withdraw more attentional resources from the task-relevant RDKs than task-irrelevant neutral stimuli. However, {{it is not clear whether}} the emotion-related differences in the SSVEP response are conditional on higher-level extraction of emotional cues as indexed by well-known event-related potential (ERPs) components (N 170, early posterior negativity, EPN), or if affective bias in competition for visual attention resources is a consequence of a time-invariant shifting process. In the present study, we used two different types of emotional distractors – IAPS pictures and facial expressions – for which emotional cue extraction occurs at different speeds, being typically earlier for faces (at ~ 170 ms, as indexed by the N 170) than for IAPS images (~ 220 – 280 ms, EPN). We found that emotional <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> attentional <b>resources</b> as measured by the SSVEP occurred earlier for faces (around 180 ms) than for IAPS pictures (around 550 ms), after the extraction of emotional cues as indexed by visual ERP components. This is consistent with emotion related re-allocation <b>of</b> attentional <b>resources</b> occurring after emotional cue extraction rather than being linked to a time-fixed shifting process...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{financial}} issues of the CAP reform {{at the edge of}} the EU enlargement, looking at the new distribution <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> programmed for the “second pillar” of the CAP.

40|$|The present {{paper was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the effect of low-frequency electrical stimulation (25 Hz) of the peduncolopontine (PPN) area on working memory (WM) functioning in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Five PD patients who underwent simultaneous PPN area- and subthalamic nucleus-deep brain stimulation (DBS) implantation participated in the study. PD patients were evaluated {{in the morning at}} least 12 h after antiparkinsonian therapy withdrawal in two conditions: i) after continuous PPN area stimulation (Off Therapy/On PPN: "On" condition); ii) at least 120 min after PPN area had been switched "Off" (Off Ther/Off PPN: "Off" condition). The experimental WM task consisted of an n-back paradigm with verbal and visual-object stimuli. PD patients showed a consistent response time decrease on both the verbal and the visual-object tasks passing from the "Off" to the "On" condition (p < 0. 05). However, the accuracy score did not significantly differ between the two experimental conditions. The present findings, although preliminary, suggest that PPN area stimulation facilitates the speed processing of information in the content of WM, possibly through the <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> the attentional <b>resources...</b>|$|R

This dissertation focuses on the resources underlying these computations, and the task-dependent allocation <b>of</b> these <b>resources.</b> We present evidence that principles from optimal coding and optimal estimation account for overt and covert orienting phenomena, as observed from both behavioral experiments and neuronal recordings. First, we review behavioral measurements related to selective attention and discuss models that account for these data. We show that reallocation <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> emerges as a natural property of systems that encode their inputs efficiently under non-uniform constraints. We continue by discussing the attentional <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> neuronal activity, and showthat: (1) <b>Modulation</b> <b>of</b> coding strategies does not require special mechanisms: it is possible to obtain dramatic modulation even when signals informing the system about fidelity requirements enter the system in a fashion indistinguishable from sensory signals. (2) Optimal coding under non-uniform fidelity requirements is sufficient to account for the firing rate modulation observed during selective attention experiments. (3) The response of a single neuron cannot bewell characterized by measurements <b>of</b> attentional <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> only a single sensory stimulus. (4) The magnitude <b>of</b> the activity <b>modulation</b> depends on the capacity of the neural circuit. A later chapter discusses the neural mechanisms for resource allocation, and the relation between attentional mechanisms and receptive field formation. The remainder of the dissertation focuses on overt orienting phenomena and active perception. We present a theoretical analysis of the allocation <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> during state estimation of multiple targets with different uncertainties, together with eye-tracking experiments that confirm our predictions. We finish by discussing the implications of these results to our current understanding of orienting phenomena and the neural code...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of spatial}} {{attention}} {{has often been}} represented as a fixed "spotlight", which highlights a specific region in the visual space disregarding other locations. However, {{the focus of attention}} can also be adjusted in size, like a "zoom-lens", according to the task demand. Although neuroimaging data supported this hypothesis, showing that the increasing size of the attended region causes an increased retinotopic extent of activation in striate and extra-striate visual areas, the causal role of fronto-parietal network in this focus size-dependent modulation in visual cortex has not been clarified. In the present study participants were asked to detect as fast as possible a visual target, which could appear at three possible eccentricities from the fixation. A non-informative cue was used to modulate the size of the attended region. In a half of the trials, a small circle cue, which included only the first eccentricity, was used to narrow the attentional focus (zoom-in). In the other half, a large circle cue, which included all the three possible eccentricities, had the role to induce participants to broaden the attended region (zoom-out). Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the right and left FEF areas or Vertex was used to interfere with the focus size-dependent modulation. Results show that only TMS over the right FEF area was able to interfere with the <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> the attentional focus size. Precisely, when TMS was delivered after the onset of a large cue, participants failed to zoom-out the focus of attention. The process of zoom-in, instead, was not inhibited by TMS on the right FEF. Our results provide causal link between the role of the right FEF area and the <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> the attentional <b>resources</b> allocated in the visual field...|$|R

After a critical review of the most relevant questions arisen around the effectiveness and the viability <b>of</b> <b>modulation,</b> the paper presents results about its possible application in Italy. In {{the first part of}} the paper a special attention is given to the actual distribution of direct aids in Italy, to the number of farms involved and the amount of revenues realised. In the second part four different hypotheses <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> are tested. In order to evaluate the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> revenues under the four different hypotheses are compared with the financial resources allotted in Italy to the regional Rural Development Plans (RDPs).

40|$|Voluntarily {{directing}} visual {{attention to}} a cued position in space leads to improved processing of forthcoming visual stimuli at this position, due to anticipatory tuning of visual cortex activity. Recent evidence points to a determining role <b>of</b> <b>modulations</b> <b>of</b> posterior alpha-band activity (8 - 14 Hz) during attention orienting. This thesis investigates the <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> EEG alpha-oscillations during anticipatory preparation for a visual target.
