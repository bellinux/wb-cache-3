50|$|O. nigra is a predator, {{scavenger}} and filter feeder. It <b>catches</b> <b>pieces</b> {{of organic}} detritus and small invertebrate prey with its arms and thrusts them into its mouth. It can scavenge from carcases or graze on algal films. As a suspension feeder, it raises {{one or more}} arms into the current of water flowing past. There is a net of mucous threads among the spines on the arms which trap plankton and other organic floating matter. These are then rolled into boluses and transported to the mouth by ciliary currents and the tube feet.|$|R

The interview shows journalist Clete Roberts following up on the members of the M*A*S*H 4077th. The previous week Roberts had interviewed Hawkeye Pierce, and this week he is catching up with O'Reilly. At the police department and through store windows on the street, O'Reilly and Micklejohn <b>catch</b> <b>pieces</b> of the television interview, giving viewers of the pilot a chance to sample the potential series and to build a bridge between the events of M*A*S*H and W*A*L*T*E*R.|$|R

50|$|During the 1980s, the {{structure}} of the parking garages had deteriorated to the point where large canvas panels had to be attached to the outside to <b>catch</b> <b>pieces</b> of concrete that would occasionally drop off onto the sidewalk below. Renovations were made to correct that problem. The city shut down the facility in 2002 after concluding that it was a drain on city coffers. However, the city did not hold any public hearings, referendum votes, or conduct any surveys, and several groups, local stakeholders, and the Coalition to Save Our Coliseum mounted a campaign to save and renovate the Coliseum, to no avail. Others in the community supported the plan to demolish the arena. Despite Mayor DeStefano's plan to close and demolish the building within six months, it ultimately took more than four years.|$|R

5000|$|Sensurround made Earthquake {{a popular}} [...] "event" [...] film in 1974 {{and one of}} the year's highest-grossing films. Sensurround {{presented}} practical challenges, though, in multiplex cinemas where separate theater spaces shared walls. Audiences for The Godfather Part II, which opened the same month (November 1974) as Earthquake, often complained to theater managers about the Sensurround effect when Earthquake was shown in an adjoining theater. The low-frequency vibrations rattled tiles and plaster, too, leading to damage in some venues; a safety net was installed at Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood to <b>catch</b> errant <b>pieces</b> of plaster falling from the ceiling. When Earthquake was screened in Chicago, the head of the Chicago Building and Safety Department demanded that the system be turned down or removed to prevent damage to city theaters. In Germany, Sensurround movies could only be screened in single-screen houses. Subsequent Sensurround films, such as Midway, also tended to play in single-screen cinemas.|$|R
60|$|Pretty {{soon the}} boys {{came to a}} place where a great number of people were {{standing}} on a sort of parapet, and leaning upon an iron railing, where they seemed to be looking down into some cavity. They hurried to the place, and, stepping up upon the parapet, they looked down too, and found there a range of dens {{below the surface of the}} ground, all full of bears. These dens were sunken yards, six or eight feet deep, and enclosed with perpendicular walls all around, so that the bears could not possibly get out. There were iron railings around the top, and a great many people were standing there looking down to the bears. There were four or five of these yards, all in a row; and as there were many great trees overshadowing them, the place was cool and pleasant. Some of the bears were walking about on the stone pavement which formed the bottom of the dens; others were sitting on their hind legs, and holding up their fore paws to <b>catch</b> the <b>pieces</b> of gingerbread which were thrown down to them by the people above. There were a number of little birds hopping about there, picking up the crums that were left, though they took care to keep out of the way of the bears. Rollo and Carlos bought some cakes of gingerbread of a woman who kept a stall near by, and, breaking them into pieces, they threw them down to the bears. They threw the most to a great white bear that was in one of the dens, and who particularly attracted their attention. Rollo told Carlos that he supposed this bear must have come from the north pole. The boys were both by this time rather hungry; but they were so much interested in seeing the bears try to <b>catch</b> the <b>pieces</b> of gingerbread that they did not think to eat any of it themselves, but threw it all down to them, all except one piece which Rollo gave to a little girl who stood beside him, to let her throw it, because she had none of her own. For this kindness the girl thanked Rollo, in French, in a very polite and proper manner.|$|R

50|$|The first prelude, in B-flat major, {{begins with}} a five-note blues motif; {{virtually}} all the melodic material in the piece is based on this theme. Syncopated rhythms based on the Brazilian baião and chords containing flattened sevenths occur throughout; these give the piece a strong jazz feel. Although these sounds are far from adventurous by modern standards, to the audiences of the late 1920s they were almost unheard of. Structurally, the piece is in ternary form; however, the impression on the listener {{is that of a}} fantasia. This effect is achieved by using snippets of various virtuoso techniques, such as repeated notes, octaves, scales, and crossed hands, each of which is used for only a moment before the <b>piece</b> <b>catches</b> a flicker of some new idea.|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of visually guided reaching movements {{relies on a}} large neural network. Based on indirect experimental evidence, {{it has been suggested}} that the superior colliculus, a subcortical centre known for its key role in controlling rapid orienting gaze shifts, also belongs to this network. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the cat superior colliculus (SC) in the control of visually guided reaching movements. To address this issue, we studied the effect of SC electrical stimulation on forelimb reaching movements in two cats trained to <b>catch</b> a <b>piece</b> of food. Electrical stimulation delivered just after the movement onset yielded a consistent perturbation of the movement trajectory of the forelimb extremity. This perturbation followed stimulation onset by 56 +/- 11 ms on average, and consisted of a deviation of the spatial path and a deceleration of the movement. The forelimb perturbation was elicited in the absence of concomitant gaze or head displacement in 52 % of the stimulation trials. Forelimb perturbations were followed by in-flight adjustments so that reaching movements reliably ended on the target. The present results constitute the first behavioural evidence for a contribution of the cat SC to the control of visually guided forelimb movements...|$|R
5000|$|Since Rex and Bree separated, the {{children}} have become even more curious about his whereabouts, since Bree has not {{told them about the}} separation. Bree is finding it increasingly difficult to relate to her son Andrew since he is angry over the fact that [...] "she has sent his father away". When Andrew goes out again and decides not to tell Bree, she forces Danielle to call him. Bree searches through Andrew's room for anything suspicious. In a wooden box, she finds a matchbook which has the address and number of a local strip club. As Andrew and his two friends become aroused by the strippers, they become terrified when they realize that Bree is standing behind them as she <b>catches</b> a <b>piece</b> of lingerie. The two friends are embarrassed and quickly leave, leaving Andrew to deal with his mother. She tells him that she will be cleaning his room tomorrow and that he is being irresponsible. Bree ruins the expectations of the other men present by giving Andrew a long lecture on how strippers are people as well. Bree and Andrew then leave. The next morning, Bree cleans Andrew's room which leads him to ask when he will be getting his door back.|$|R
50|$|Crab lining is a handlining {{technique}} used to <b>catch</b> crabs. A <b>piece</b> of bait, normally the neck or {{leg of a}} chicken, is tied to one end with a weight {{in order to keep}} it from floating. The line is then cast by hand to an area approximately five to ten feet from where it is being cast. This is to ensure easy retrieval of the line and to avoid unnecessary time spent fighting currents, rocks, and other obstacles in the water. Once a crab takes the bait, the line will tighten. It is important to not tug at the line once a pull is noticed. The line must be slowly retrieved, inch-by-inch, until the crab is visible in the water. Upon visibility, a hand net may be used to capture the crab.|$|R
50|$|In Bulgaria, {{the term}} halva (халва) {{is used for}} several {{varieties}} of the dessert. Tahini halva (тахан халва) is most popular {{and can be found}} in all food stores. Two different types of tahini halva are made - one using sunflower seed tahini and another using sesame seed tahini. Traditionally, the regions of Yablanitsa and Haskovo are famous for their halva. Semolina halva (грис халва) is made at home and can be found only in some pastry stores. White halva (бяла халва), which is made of sugar, is popular on the last Sunday before Lent (Sirni Zagovezni; Сирни заговезни), celebrated with customs, in one of which a string is tied to a piece of white halva and all the children, while standing in a circle must <b>catch</b> the turning <b>piece</b> of halva using only their mouths.|$|R

He would remove his coat, sit upon a macadamized lounge and read, in the evening paper, of Russians and Japs {{slaughtered}} by the deadly linotype. For dinner there would be pot roast, a salad flavored with a dressing warranted not to crack or injure the leather, stewed rhubarb and the bottle of strawberry marmalade blushing at the certificate of chemical purity on its label. After dinner Katy would show him the new patch in her crazy quilt that the iceman had cut for her off the end of his four-in-hand.

Then the gent at the window across the air-shaft would get out his flute; the nightly gas leak would steal forth to frolic in the highways; the dumbwaiter would slip off its trolley; the janitor would drive Mrs. Zanowitski's five children once more across the Yalu, the lady with the champagne shoes and the Skye terrier would trip downstairs and paste her Thursday name over her bell and letter-box--and the evening routine of the Frogmore flats would be under way.|$|R
5000|$|After Rick is {{hit with}} the arrow, Negan and Dwight retreat {{to the rest of}} The Savior horde, hoping to devise a plan of attack against the {{remaining}} survivors at Hilltop. When night completely falls on the colony, Negan is almost accidentally shot by one of The Saviors, who states he couldn't see properly in the darkness. Negan says that it is not that dark and asks one of his Saviors the status of the battle. The Savior tells him most of The Saviors are now re-grouped, and they are ready {{to get back on the}} defensive and Negan orders him and the rest of the men to get ready for their attack on the Hilltop mansion. When they begin their attack, they are immediately surrounded by many of Rick's forces, who manage to cause Negan to order and retreat and head back to The Savior camps on the hillside near Hilltop. After his and The Saviors' retreat, Negan is seen back at the camp alongside Dwight, who questions if camping so close to Hilltop is a good idea. Negan says that they are doing it and remarks that he sometimes wonders if Dwight has ever had a brain in his head. He elaborates by saying that Rick's forces won't have enough manpower to counterattack and that because Dwight shot Rick with an arrow, his death will cause the remaining forces to bow back down to Negan, and he says that he will be their Savior again, as long as they let him urinate on Rick's dead body. Seeing the look on Dwight's face, Negan says that there's nothing weird about that; Negan says that since Rick's ruined everything, [...] "it'd be weird if I DIDN'T piss all over his dead, bloated body." [...] He is informed that Carson has escaped with Eugene. Negan tells him not to worry about it, and that they will deal with them later. Negan arrives at Hilltop's gates and shoots twice into the air. He claims that he's here to accept their surrender and asks them to send whoever is now in charge out. He swears the area he's in will be a safe zone, and there won't be any bloodshed. After getting impatient, Negan threatens to come back inside when Rick exits the Hilltop. Bowled over with shock to see him still alive, Negan turns towards Dwight for an answer, but Rick tells him to [...] "look at me." [...] Overcoming his initial shock, Negan asks Rick to surrender, to [...] "let things go back the way they were" [...] but Rick refuses. Negan repeats that he only kills people to make an example and threatens Rick that he will do so again if pushed too far, but Rick replies by saying he's [...] "the stupidest fucking person still alive." [...] Taken aback, Negan asks what he's talking about. Rick goes on to say that they should pool their resources and people together. Negan doesn't believe him, saying that with the system he's been using, he is saving lives. Rick tells him in the current situation, the only ones who are winning are the undead; the only way to get through this is by working together. Negan takes this all in, and Rick says that they can take their supplies, but they must give the survivors something in return; make supplies of their own to give or trade for others via a barter system. A fog seems to lift from Negan's mind and finally sees what Rick has been talking about; he realizes that his actions and methods have only helped himself while the communities he's been threatening have suffered. Negan says he's been wrong all along and that Rick is right. Rick then slashes Negan's throat with a knife, responding [...] "Good." [...] Caught by surprise, Negan begins bleeding out while Rick begins to address the remaining Saviors. Negan then tackles Rick and begins beating him. Despite Rick putting up a fight, Negan catches one of Rick's legs and breaks it. Laughing, he eventually passes out due to blood loss. He eventually wakes up inside one of the rooms in the Hilltop and sees Rick standing over him. He admits to Rick that during the conversation Rick had with Carl, he was able only to <b>catch</b> bits and <b>pieces</b> of it. He knows that Rick decided not to kill him, but asks what's going to happen now. Rick reveals that he's going to keep Negan alive so he can see how much Negan was holding the survivors back. Rick also tells Negan that he's going to rot in jail until he dies an old man.|$|R
