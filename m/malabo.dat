25|$|The {{shipping}} agreement {{granted the}} Soviets permission {{to establish a}} pilot fishery development project and also a naval base at Luba. In return the USSR was to supply fish to Equatorial Guinea. China and Cuba also gave different forms of financial, military, and technical assistance to Equatorial Guinea, which gave them a measure of influence there. For the USSR, despite the unsavoury background of Macias Nguema, there was an advantage to be gained in the War in Angola by having access to Luba base and later on to <b>Malabo</b> International Airport.|$|E
25|$|In July 2012, the CPLP refused Equatorial Guinea full membership, {{primarily}} because of its continued serious violations of human rights. The government responded by legalizing political parties, declaring a moratorium on the death penalty, and starting a dialog with all political factions. Additionally, the IILP secured land from {{the government for the}} construction of Portuguese language cultural centers in Bata and <b>Malabo.</b> At its 10th summit in Dili in July 2014, Equatorial Guinea was admitted as a CPLP member. Abolition of the death penalty and the promotion of Portuguese as an official language were preconditions of the approval.|$|E

25|$|The May 2013 {{elections}} {{were marked by}} a series of events including the popular protest planned by a group of activists from the MPP (Movement of Popular Protest) which included several social and political groups. The MPP called for a peaceful protest at the Plaza de la Mujer square on 15 May. The MPP coordinator Enrique Nsolo Nzo was arrested and the official state media portrayed him as an individual who was planning to destabilize the country and depose the president. However, and despite speaking under duress and with clear signs of torture, Enrique clearly stated that they were planning a peaceful protest and had indeed obtained all the legal authorizations required to carry out the peaceful protest. In addition to that, and despite the repeated attempts of the state media to link Enrique to an illegal political party, he firmly stated that he was not affiliated with any political parties in the country. The Plaza de la Mujer square in <b>Malabo</b> was occupied by the police from 13 May and it has been heavily guarded ever since. The government embarked on a censorship program that affected social sites including Facebook and other websites that were critical to the government of Equatorial Guinea. In their censorship efforts, they would redirect all the searches performed online to the official government website.|$|E

A fleet that had numbered 32 aircraft in 1984 had gradually reduced to just three aircraft in October 2000. The United Kingdom cited safety concerns again in 2001 when it refused to allow Nigeria Airways to operate the Lagos–London route, this time regarding the Boeing 747 that was leased from Air Djibouti to fly the route. That year, the IFC withdrew from its advisory position citing the unwillingness of both the company and the government to carry out the necessary measures that would make the airline attractive to potential investors. Later on, there were various allegations claiming the airline's failure was accelerated by former Nigerian rulers who looted and mismanaged the company, {{to the extent that the}} government started an investigation into the disappearance of more than million between 1983 and 1999.

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} elections, the {{opposition}} party CPDS announced {{that they were going}} to protest peacefully against the 26 May elections on 25 June.

On the night of 24 June, the CPDS headquarters in <b>Malabo</b> were surrounded by heavily armed police officers in order to keep those inside from leaving and thus effectively blocking the protest. Several leading members of CPDS were detained in <b>Malabo</b> and others in Bata were kept from boarding several local flights to <b>Malabo.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The U.S. Department of Justice {{has accused}} Teodorin of {{carrying}} out [...] "corruption schemes" [...] and charging businesses illegal commissions.

2500|$|Life in the {{university}} was interrupted when World War II came. On 26 May 1942, some {{three weeks after the}} fall of Corregidor, two Japanese transports anchored in Dumaguete. Silliman was occupied by the Japanese forces and was converted into a garrison. One of its buildings, Channon Hall, became the headquarters of the dreaded Japanese kempeitai or military police where many Filipinos were tortured and killed. During the occupation, many members of the faculty and the student body were forced to evacuate to four localities within the province. Under the leadership of Dr. Arthur Carson, then president of Silliman, the remaining members of the faculty continued the operations of the University in the mountains of Negros Oriental. This {{led to the formation of}} what was then called the [...] "Jungle University" [...] in <b>Malabo,</b> Valencia, one of the localities in the province.
