5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 18 April 1945, he led his company through the shell-battered, sniper-infested {{wreckage}} of Nuremberg, Germany. When blistering machinegun fire caught his unit in an exposed position, he ordered his men to take cover, dashed forward alone, and, as bullets whined about him, shot the 3-man guncrew with his carbine. Continuing the advance at the head of his company, he located an enemy patrol armed with rocket launchers which threatened friendly armor. He again went forward alone, secured a vantage point and opened fire on the Germans. Immediately he became the target for concentrated <b>machine</b> <b>pistol</b> and rocket fire, which blasted the rubble about him. Calmly, he continued to shoot at the patrol until he had killed all 6 enemy infantrymen. Continuing boldly far in front of his company, he entered a park, where as his men advanced, a German machinegun opened up on them without warning. With his carbine, he killed the gunner; and then, from a completely exposed position, he directed machinegun fire on the remainder of the crew until all were dead. In a final duel, he wiped out a third machinegun emplacement with rifle fire at a range of 10 yards. By fearlessly engaging in 4 single-handed fire fights with a desperate, powerfully armed enemy, Lt. DALY, voluntarily taking all major risks himself and protecting his men at every opportunity, killed 15 Germans, silenced 3 enemy machineguns and wiped out an entire enemy patrol. His heroism during the lone bitter struggle with fanatical enemy forces was an inspiration to the valiant Americans who took Nuremberg.|$|E

50|$|As a small, concealable weapon with a {{high rate}} of fire, <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> have {{numerous}} applications. Bodyguards from government or private agencies sometimes carry concealed <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> when they are protecting high-risk VIPs. Criminal gang members such as narcotics traffickers also use <b>machine</b> <b>pistols,</b> often cheaper guns such as the MAC-10 or the Tec-9 which have been illegally converted to fire in a fully automatic fashion. In a law enforcement context, <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> may be used by tactical police units such as SWAT teams or hostage rescue teams which are operating inside buildings and other cramped spaces, although they tend to use submachine guns instead.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the decades}} after World War II, <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> {{were used in}} close quarter combat where a rifle would be too unwieldy, such as in urban house-to-house {{fighting}} or in tunnels. In these contexts, <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> were viewed as [...] "room brooms", which could sweep a space with automatic fire. While training doctrines for <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> vary between armies, in general, soldiers are instructed to use the weapon for short bursts, rather than for an uninterrupted period of automatic fire, because the weapon easily gets {{out of control in}} sustained firing, which means that many of the rounds may be off target. As well, given the high rate of fire of <b>machine</b> <b>pistols,</b> sustained firing wastes ammunition and can easily deplete the magazine too quickly.|$|R
50|$|When law {{enforcement}} agencies are using <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> in non-concealed settings, this makes it feasible to add accessories such as optical sights, laser sights, flashlights, forward handgrips, rear stocks, or sound suppressors. Many 2000s-era <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> have mounting rails to facilitate the addition of accessories. Agencies sometimes use sound suppressors for maneuvers {{in which it is}} anticipated that shots may be fired indoors, because the sound pressure from indoor firing can be deafening. Some <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> offer the option of using translucent plastic magazines which allows the officer to quickly verify the level of ammunition left in the magazine. Another option that {{law enforcement}} officers may use on occasion is high-capacity magazines such as single or double drum magazines.|$|R
25|$|Technical Sergeant Ted T. Tanouye {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} extraordinary heroism in action on 7 July 1944, near Molino A Ventoabbto, Italy. Technical Sergeant Tanouye led his platoon {{in an attack}} to capture {{the crest of a}} strategically important hill that afforded little cover. Observing an enemy machine gun crew placing its gun in position to his left front, Technical Sergeant Tanouye crept forward a few yards and opened fire on the position, killing or wounding three and causing two others to disperse. Immediately, an enemy <b>machine</b> <b>pistol</b> opened fire on him. He returned the fire and killed or wounded three more enemy soldiers. While advancing forward, Technical Sergeant Tanouye was subjected to grenade bursts, which severely wounded his left arm. Sighting an enemy-held trench, he raked the position with fire from his submachine gun and wounded several of the enemy. Running out of ammunition, he crawled 20 yards to obtain several clips from a comrade on his left flank. Next, sighting an enemy <b>machine</b> <b>pistol</b> that had pinned down his men, Technical Sergeant Tanouye crawled forward a few yards and threw a hand grenade into the position, silencing the pistol. He then located another enemy machine gun firing down the slope of the hill, opened fire on it, and silenced that position. Drawing fire from a <b>machine</b> <b>pistol</b> nest located above him, he opened fire on it and wounded three of its occupants. Finally taking his objective, Technical Sergeant Tanouye organized a defensive position on the reverse slope of the hill before accepting first aid treatment and evacuation. Technical Sergeant Tanouye's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.|$|E

The man pulled a MAC-10 <b>machine</b> <b>pistol</b> from the bag and fired at Scarfo. Scarfo was struck eight times in the neck, arms and torso, but no vital organs were hit. Scarfo returned home just nine days later.|$|E
25|$|As {{the prisoners}} were captured, they were interrogated for any useful information, and taken out by motor car, usually in small parties of two at a time, on the pretext of {{returning}} them to their prison camp.

The prisoners were then shot at close range from behind by pistol or <b>machine</b> <b>pistol</b> fire. The bodies were then left for retrieval, after which they were cremated and returned to Stalag Luft III.|$|E

5000|$|Machine pistol: A handgun-style firearm, {{capable of}} fully {{automatic}} or burst fire. They are sometimes {{equipped with a}} foldable shoulder stock, to enable better accuracy during automatic fire, which then makes them very similar to submachine guns. Some <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> are shaped very similar to semi-automatics (e.g. the Glock 18). As with SMGs, <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> generally fire pistol caliber cartridges (such as the 9mm, [...]40, [...]45 ACP etc.).|$|R
50|$|<b>Machine</b> <b>pistols</b> {{have long}} been criticized for their {{inaccuracy}}. The inaccuracy of most <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> occurs because {{it is hard to}} control a fully automatic weapon that has such a low weight and in many cases, lacks a proper shoulder stock. As a result, in the hands of all but the most expert shooters, <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> being fired on full automatic tend to rise up during firing. <b>Machine</b> <b>pistols</b> also tend to have a very small sight radius and short barrels, meaning that the effectiveness beyond 50 meters degrades rapidly. One solution to improve controllability is the use of burst-limiters. Commonly, three or two-round bursts are used. Another solution is to steady the weapon in some fashion, either by outfitting it with a shoulder stock, using a shoulder strap to pull down {{on the front of the}} barrel, or resting the weapon against a hard surface which can be used as a bracing point. Slower rates of fire also allow better controllability. Use of a ported barrel, muzzle brake or suppressor can further be used to reduce muzzle climb.|$|R

A number of Hells Angels members were later imprisoned on charges of international trafficking of cocaine and ecstasy, the production and distribution of marijuana, money laundering and murder, after an investigation that lasted over a year.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{weapon for}} NCOs and officers was the 7.63 mm Mauser C96 semi-automatic pistol, or full-automatic Mauser M1932/M712 <b>machine</b> <b>pistol.</b> These full-automatic versions {{were used as}} substitutes for submachine guns (such as the MP 18) and rifles that were in short supply within the Chinese army prior {{to the end of}} World War II. Throughout the Second Sino-Japanese War, particularly in the early years, the NRA also extensively used captured Japanese weapons and equipment as their own were in short supply. Some élite units also used Lend-Lease US equipment as the war progressed.|$|E
25|$|The Glock 18 is a selective-fire {{variant of}} the Glock 17, {{developed}} {{at the request of}} the Austrian counter-terrorist unit EKO Cobra, and as a way to internally test Glock components under high strain conditions. Originally produced in 1986, this machine pistol–class firearm has a lever-type fire-control selector switch, installed on the serrated portion of the rear left side of the slide. With the selector lever in the bottom position, the pistol fires fully automatically, and with the selector lever in the top position, the pistol fires semiautomatically. The firearm is typically used with an extended 33-round-capacity magazine, although other magazines from the Glock 17 will function, with available capacities of 10, 17, or 19 rounds. Unlike all its other pistols, Glock is highly secretive about Glock 18 models, not featuring them on its official websites or its public catalogues, and because of the pistol's nature, it is only offered to military, law enforcement and government organizations, and its production details are highly classified. Early Glock 18 models were ported to reduce muzzle rise during automatic fire. A very early design introduced a longer ported barrel which was soon discarded as it would not fit in a holster. Another compensated variant was produced, known as the Glock 18C. It has a keyhole opening cut into the forward portion of the slide, similar to the opening on the Glock long-slide models, although the Glock 18 has a standard-length slide. The keyhole opening provides an area to allow the four, progressively larger (from back to front) compensator cuts machined into the barrel to vent the propellant gases upwards, affording more control over the rapid-firing <b>machine</b> <b>pistol.</b>|$|E

50|$|Rather {{similar in}} {{appearance}} {{to many other}} <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> of the time, it has a metal stock that can be folded {{on top of the}} weapon as well as a safety switch on the trigger. It was later configured to fire a wide variety of ammunition types, and thanks to the 600 rpm rate of fire, it is more manageable than other similar <b>machine</b> <b>pistols.</b> The Ingram MAC-10's rate of fire for example is 1,100 rpm.|$|R
50|$|Military <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> usually use fully {{jacketed}} ammunition {{in accordance}} with the Hague convention. Fully jacketed cartridges are less likely to become deformed and flattened on impact, which means that permanent cavitation inflicted on human tissue, and therefore the damage that they do to the body, is moderated. Some special forces use specialty ammunition in <b>machine</b> <b>pistols</b> or PDWs, such as loading several tracer rounds per magazine to aid in night-time shooting, or for a squad leader to direct his soldiers' attention toward a location for concentrated fire.|$|R
25|$|For regular provincial Chinese {{divisions}} {{the standard}} rifles were the Hanyang 88 (copy of Gewehr 88). Central army divisions were typically {{equipped with the}} Chiang Kai-shek rifle (copy of Mauser Standard Model) and Czechoslovakian vz. 24. However, {{for most of the}} German-trained divisions, the standard firearms were German-made 7.92 mm Gewehr 98 and Karabiner 98k. The standard light machine gun was a local copy of the Czech 7.92 mm Brno ZB26. There were also Belgian and French light machine guns. Provincial units generally did not possess any machine guns, while Central Army units had one LMG per platoon on average. The German-trained divisions ideally had 1 LMG per squad. Surprisingly, the NRA did not purchase any Maschinengewehr 34s from Germany, but did produce its own copies of them. Heavy machine guns were mainly locally-made Type 24 water-cooled Maxim guns, which were the Chinese copies of the German MG08, and M1917 Browning machine guns chambered for the standard 8mm Mauser round. On average, every Central Army battalion would get one heavy machine gun (about a third to half of what actual German divisions got during World War II). The standard weapon for NCOs and officers was the 7.63 mm Mauser C96 semi-automatic pistol, or full-automatic Mauser M1932/M712 <b>machine</b> <b>pistol.</b> These full-automatic versions were used as substitutes for submachine guns (such as the MP 18) and rifles that were in short supply within the Chinese army prior to the end of World War II.

500|$|Gears of War 2 is a {{third person}} shooter with an {{emphasis}} on the tactical use of cover, and retains much of the same gameplay from the first game. The player, playing as either Marcus or Dominic in the campaign mode, or as any of the human or Locust characters in multiplayer mode, can only carry a pistol, one type of grenade, and two other weapons at any time, though they may swap these for weapons found in strategic locations or left by downed foes or fallen allies. Each weapon can be used for normal fire as well as for melee attacks; the game's signature Lancer, an assault rifle mounted with a chainsaw bayonet for its melee, can be used to instantly kill foes. The game introduces the ability to engage in chainsaw duels should the player attempt to chainsaw an opponent also using the Lancer; the player is presented with a controller button to press rapidly to try to win the duel and avoid death. Gears of War 2 rebalances the power of the existing weapons while introducing five new ones: a flamethrower, a chain gun, a mortar cannon, a [...] "Gorgon" [...] Pistol, and the Ink Grenade. The chain gun and the mortar are heavy weapons, forcing the player to move at walking speed while carrying it in both hands. The Gorgon Pistol is an SMG-like <b>machine</b> <b>pistol</b> that fires four four-shot bursts per magazine. The Ink Grenade doesn't damage with its detonation, but instead temporarily poisons the area it was thrown, making it very useful for driving enemies out of cover. Grenades can be planted on walls or floors as proximity traps that go off when an enemy nears, but only fragmentation grenades have the ability to kill foes when they go off.|$|E
