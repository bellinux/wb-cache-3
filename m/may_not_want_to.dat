25|$|Fujian-based website Straight Consume once {{published}} an article that alleged that Zhang's eldest brother had left China and died fighting {{as part of an}} insurrection against the government of the Philippines sometime in the 1960s. According to online sources in Fujian, Zhang was said to have cut most ties with his siblings after he ascended to higher positions in the world of politics. When serving in Shenzhen, his elder brother visited him but he was said to have told his brother that he was too busy to see him. State media curiously made no mention of Zhang Xiaoyan while profiling the families of each {{of the members of the}} Politburo Standing Committee in 2013, suggesting that Zhang <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> emphasize any connections he may have with a Hong Kong tycoon.|$|E

500|$|... "Indian Camp" [...] is an {{initiation}} story. Nick's father (Dr. Adams) exposes {{his young}} son to [...] childbirth and, unintentionally, to violent death—an experience that causes Nick to equate childbirth with death. Hemingway critic Wendolyn Tetlow maintains that in [...] "Indian Camp", sexuality culminates in [...] "butchery-style" [...] birth and bloody death, and that Nick's anxiety is obvious when he {{turns away from the}} butchery. The story reaches a climax when Nick's [...] "heightened awareness" [...] of evil causes him to turn away from the experience. Although Nick <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> watch the caesarian, his father insists he watch - he does not want his son to be initiated into an adult world without toughness, writes Thomas Strychacz.|$|E
500|$|The {{playability}} and [...] "life-span" [...] of {{the game}} also gained mixed views. Rignall praised the game's playability and [...] "lastability", stating that the game is [...] "easy to get into" [...] and was addictive. Regarding its replay value, Rignall asserted that {{the large number of}} levels in the game would keep the player occupied and provided an [...] "enjoyable challenge". Jarrett stated the game requires [...] "a lot of patience" [...] and found certain aspects of it frustrating at times, especially the time limit required to progress to the next level. Jarrett also noted the number of levels to be [...] "excessive", and stated that he suspected [...] "players <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> dig that deep".|$|E
500|$|Lifesong {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Kim Jones of About.com gave it {{five out of}} five stars, saying [...] "Bottom line - my hat goes off to Casting Crowns for a job well done, once again. This is one band that doesn't soft-pedal their message, {{even if it is}} one that people enjoying a [...] "comfort-zone" [...] <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hear". Jared Johnson of AllMusic gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining [...] "One of the brightest spots on the CCM map in 2005, Lifesong was powered by a second dose of Mark Hall's earnestly challenging worship themes and a penchant for reflective pop... From start to finish, the album showcases songwriting that is consistent, polished, and potent, furthering the septet's reputation as one of Christian music's most popular acts of the 21st century". Deborah Evans Price of Billboard said that [...] "there is no sophomore letdown here for Casting Crowns... This is intelligent, soulful music that goes beyond mere entertainment to something deeper". David McCreary of CCM Magazine gave Lifesong an A-, opining [...] "staying true to their approach of assimilating crisp melodies, forthright lyrics and stout vocals, the Crowns effectively blend uptempo worship anthems and emotive ballads for another well-balanced set". Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today gave the album three-and-a-half out of five stars, calling the music [...] "derivative", said that [...] " [...] fans will find much to love, while others continue to ponder the secret of this band's success. All can probably agree that Lifesong is a sequel in the truest sense, offering more of the same to the delight of those so touched and inspired by the music of Casting Crowns the first time".|$|E

2500|$|If {{both the}} {{borrower}} and lender are well-known {{and the market}} (or even worse, the news media) learns that the bank is selling the loan, then the sale {{may be viewed as}} signaling a lack of trust in the borrower, which could severely damage the banker-client relationship. [...] In addition, the bank simply <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sell or share the potential profits from the loan. By buying a credit default swap, the bank can lay off default risk while still keeping the loan in its portfolio.

2500|$|When it was rereleased in 2001 as Super Mario Advance it {{received}} generally positive reviews, garnering an aggregate score of 84% on Metacritic. One reviewer concluded [...] "all nostalgia and historical influence aside, Super Mario Bros. 2 {{is still a}} game worth playing {{on the merits of}} its gameplay alone", also saying that [...] "the only reason you <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> pick it up is if ... you already own it in another form." [...] However, GameSpot thought that Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World would have been a better choice for a launch game considering their respective popularity; both titles were eventually also remade as part of the Super Mario Advance series. Conversely, IGN praised the choice, calling it [...] "one of the most polished and creative platformers of the era". The game was named one of the NES best games ever by IGN, saying that the game offers greater diversity in graphics and gameplay than the original, making it a great bridge game between the other NES Mario titles.

Carl was in his early 20s and Kirsty was 16 when they met and he became obsessive of her. Their relationship was based on hedonism and excess, rather than tenderness. When he went to prison, Kirsty promised to wait for him to be released, but she realised their relationship was toxic and ceased all contact. She then went on to marry Max. Carl is still in love with Kirsty, believing her to be [...] "the only woman for him" [...] and his second mission in Walford is to get her back. Coonan said this would cause problems between Carl and Max. He later said that [...] "In Carl's head, he's coming in on a white horse to save Kirsty from a bad marriage", and {{explained that}} while Carl was in prison he focussed on Kirsty, and she [...] "become an object of this freedom he was dreaming about. [...] Now he sees she's poodling after Max and that he isn't treating her right." [...] However, he thought that Kirsty <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> reunite with Carl because [...] "he's not the type of guy who's just going to change overnight" [...] and he is probably not [...] "the knight in shining armour" [...] he thinks he is. Coonan {{went on to say that}} Carl would treat Kirsty [...] "like a goddess" [...] but would probably have a problem with her independence, and he would want to provide for her, being [...] "old-fashioned and a bit misguided", and they would have a [...] "fiery" [...] relationship because they are both [...] "strong-willed". Kierston Wareing, who plays Kirsty, opined that her character is more suited to Carl than to Max, and hoped they could be a [...] "manipulative, power couple".|$|E
2500|$|In early September, it was {{reported}} that Kat would confess the affair to Alfie, but would refuse to name the man involved. Shane Richie spoke to Inside Soap, saying that Alfie has no reason to believe Kat is cheating on him, assumes she is just partaking in harmless flirtation, and fully trusts her. He opined that Alfie believes Kat would not lie to him after having affairs in the past, but does not believe her excuses when she receives flowers from her lover. This leads to Kat confessing. Richie said that Alfie's [...] "heart [...] break in two". Richie went on to describe the Moons' marriage as [...] "a bit staid" [...] because Alfie is [...] "set in his ways" [...] while Kat is [...] "out looking for a bit of fun." [...] He explained that Alfie is very committed to Kat, and is [...] "in this marriage for the long run." [...] He said that viewers <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see Kat and Alfie totally happy, describing them as [...] "like Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor [...] They can't be with each other and they can't be without each other." [...] He then promised that [...] "what happens to Alfie next is absolutely great!" [...] When asked what Alfie might do when he finds out who Kat is having the affair with, Richie said that he would get revenge, as [...] "everyone forgets Alfie's been in jail. Marriage has taken off his edge, but if he finds out his wife has been with one of his closest friends, well, any bloke would want to cut the other blokes knackers [...] off, wouldn't he?" [...] Richie added that the cast were [...] "thrilled" [...] with the storyline, saying that everyone involved is enjoying it. It was confirmed that viewers would not find out who Kat was having the affair with at this time, and that suspects would still be eliminated one at a time. Inside Soap then reported that a second suspect would be eliminated [...] "very soon". Michael was then eliminated in the episode broadcast on 14 September.|$|E

Second, they clearly <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to look toward the divine for protection.
