Most previous methods detected as a chorus a repeated section of a given length and had difficulty identifying both ends of a chorus section and dealing with modulations (key changes).

40|$|Active-layer photomixing is {{an optical}} {{modulation}} technique {{to probe the}} fundamental modulation response of a semiconductor laser. By heterodyning two laser sources with a tunable frequency difference in the device's active region, the gain, and hence the optical output, is modulated at the beat frequency of the sources. Using an equivalent circuit model for the laser diode, the optical modulation is shown to be decoupled from the electrical parasitics of the laser structure. The fundamental modulation response of the laser can thereby be studied independently of the parasitic response, which would otherwise mask the fundamental response. The photomixing technique is used on GaAs/GaAlAs lasers at room temperature, liquid nitrogen and liquid helium temperature, and it is verified that the modulation response appears ideal to millimeter-wave frequencies. Application of the active-layer photomixing technique led to the discovery and explanation of a new effect called the "gain lever. " It enhances the modulation efficiency of a semiconductor laser with a quantum well active layer. By inhomogeneously pumping the device, regions with unequal differential gain are created. If the laser is above threshold, then the overall modal gain is clamped, and by <b>modulating</b> the <b>section</b> with larger differential gain, the output power can be modulated with greater than unity quantum efficiency. The fundamental coupling between intensity noise and phase noise in semiconductor laser light is investigated. This coupling, described by the [alpha] parameter, causes the well-known linewidth enhancement, but also implies the fluctuations are correlated. By the technique of "amplitude-phase decorrelation," the intensity noise can be passively reduced by the ratio 1 /(1 + [alpha](2)). Using a Michelson interferometer as a frequency discriminator, intensity noise from a DFB laser is reduced below its intrinsic level up to a factor of 28. A balanced homodyne detection scheme is used to study the noise reduction {{in relation to the}} photon shot noise floor. The decorrelated intensity noise can be reduced to within a dB of the shot noise level. Reduction below shot noise may be inhibited by uncorrelated phase noise in the lasing mode...|$|R
40|$|Volume I:In {{the last}} several decades, composers of {{classical}} music have been looking forinspiration from music of non-Western cultures. This dissertation explores the music of six different composers who {{have been influenced by}} African music and incorporated their studies and recordings into new works. Four of these composers have Western backgrounds: John Cage, György Ligeti, Steve Reich, and David Fanshawe; while the other two composers, Joshua Uzoigwe and Kevin Volans, were born and grew up in Africa. This study examines how these six composers use African musical elements in their own compositions, and why they chose the specific elements they did. This dissertation {{can be used as a}} reference for other composers and musicians who wish to understand this type of cross-cultural synthesis and inspiration, and create it themselves. Volume II:Sankofa is a piece of music that was inspired by my studies and practice of West-Africandrumming and song. In the first movement, the wind ensemble embodies the three basic sounds (low, medium, and high tones) that can be produced on hand drums. The sparse texture in the first half is gradually filled in piece by piece, until a whole idea is formed from a patchwork of components from the individual instrumental sections, much in the way a West-African drum pattern is made of the polyphony from several individual parts. The second movement was inspired by the idea of Pygmy singing in Central Africa. These polyphonic Pygmy songs are comprised of many simultaneous vocal lines, seemingly unrelated by time, producing a blend of pitches and pulse. The music of the second movement explores this timeless effect by metrically <b>modulating</b> from <b>section</b> to section. The third movement consists of two forces, a drum ensemble and a wind ensemble, which at first oppose each other, but gradually each finds a way to live within the other force, leading to an overlap of the two forces at the end. The entire work is approximately twenty minutes long. The instrumentation is for standard wind ensemble, including auxiliary instruments, piano, harp, and djembe drums...|$|R

5000|$|The last {{movement}} [...] "begins {{slowly and}} gropingly," [...] with [...] "the most melancholy {{moments in the}} entire work." [...] An introduction begins this movement, which is harmonically reminiscent of Beethoven's late string quartets. After a cadence on the dominant C, the cello introduces the first theme of the sonata-allegro, which owes its simplicity to Brahms's interest in Hungarian folk music. A vociferous, stormy bridge connects the first theme to the second theme, {{which is in the}} minor-mode dominant key (C). The expositional closing theme, a jerky version of the first theme, leads into the recapitulation, which involves a developmental episode that emphasises the parallel major. The end of the recapitulation leads into a grave, quiet section in the initial tempo of the introduction, but it is arguably a simple reworking of the expositional closing theme (albeit in F minor). This short <b>section</b> <b>modulates</b> to C sharp minor, which, if it pertains to D-flat major of the first movement (as it is the parallel minor), may symbolize the musical odyssey of the entire piece. The tempo is presto for this greatly extended coda in F minor, which develops a new theme as well as the second theme of the sonata-allegro section, and ultimately culminates in an unrelenting outburst of fiery passion, providing an intense conclusion for the entire piece.|$|R
5000|$|The finale, {{formally}} a [...] "complex theme-and-variations", is {{the most}} turbulent movement. It begins with a fanfare of trumpets. Conductor Rafael Kubelik said in a rehearsal: [...] "Gentlemen, in Bohemia the trumpets never call to battle - they always call to the dance!" [...] The music progresses to a beautiful melody which is first played by the cellos. The tension is masterfully built and finally released at approximately two minutes into the piece, with a cascade of instruments triumphantly playing the initial theme at a somewhat faster pace. A central contrasting episode {{is derived from the}} main theme. From there the movement compellingly progresses through a tempestuous middle <b>section,</b> <b>modulating</b> from major to minor several times throughout. After a return to the slow, lyrical section, the piece ends on a chromatic coda, in which brass and timpani are greatly prominent. Laki summarises: [...] "Dvorák's handling of form is indebted to Beethoven and Brahms, but he filled out the form with melodies of an unmistakably Czech flavor and a joviality few composers at the time possessed. The variations vary widely in character: some are slower and some are faster in tempo, some are soft (such as the virtuosic one for solo flute), and some are noisy; most are in the major mode, though the central one, reminiscent of a village band, is in the minor. The music is always cheerful and optimistic." ...|$|R
40|$|Low noise {{devices are}} {{required}} whenever dealing with low signal power detection. The junction {{field effect transistor}} is probably the simplest structure that fulfills the low noise requirement, providing also a high impedance input and good performance in a frequency range that goes from few Hz to some MHz. Notably, JFETs are less affected by low frequency noise than MOSFETs, and, thus, represent an appropriate option for low frequency low noise applications. Apart from theoretical approach to the low noise features of JFETs, there can be process, or design, options which can enhance or reduce the onset of excess noise. An experimental study on general purpose designed JFET has been set up: five different process option, among whose a brand new technique to realize ultra shallow, highly doped top gate layers, have been investigated in search of evidences of links between either layout or process designs and noise performance. The devices have been fully described in their fabrication features, layout, DC performance and low frequency noise behaviour. The geometrical factor turned out to be substantially effective only when <b>modulating</b> the conductive <b>section</b> area of the channel along its length. Shorter anneal have been proved to be not detrimental, since no generation and recombination noise has been found neither in devices with long, nor in those with shorter anneal. Evidences have been found that confirm the theories about a correlation between current flowing and 1 /f noise intensity. Shallow gate devices, in conditions of substantial identity of other features, proved to represent neither an improvement nor a worsening in noise performance, while ultra shallow gate devices, fabricated with the new deposition technique, turned out to be much more noisy. A worse contact between boron layer and metal has been assumed to play a strong role in this phenomenon, having excluded superficial state influence. What the real causes of this noise enhancement are has to be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|This thesis covers {{experimental}} studies of atomic negative ions with the main goal of increasing our fundamental understanding of these fragile quantum systems. Comparisons of measurements and calculations {{have been used to}} increase our understanding of these highly correlated, yet simple, systems. All the described studies in this thesis have investigated the photodetachment process, i. e. when a photon removes an electron from a negative ion. The measurements were mainly performed using a collinear laser-ion beam setup at the Gothenburg University Negative Ion Laser LAboratory (GUNILLA). Novel threshold behavior was observed in studies of photodetachment of K-, Cs- and Na- to highly excited states of the residual atom that has a large and negative polarizability. The cross section of this process was seen to be greatly suppressed just above threshold. In contrast, if the residual atom is left in a state with a large and positive polarizability a rapidly rising onset in the cross section was observed. The two behaviors are attributed {{to the fact that the}} detached electron either travels in a strongly repulsive or strongly attractive potential. These potentials are similar to those found in β-decay and are an excellent example of the generality of physics. A semi-classical model was developed in order to explain the novel threshold behavior. In the studies on K- and Cs-, resonances due to doubly excited states were observed to <b>modulate</b> the cross <b>sections</b> in several photodetachment channels. In the case of K- three known and two unknown resonances were observed below the 7 2 P threshold. For Cs-, a rich spectrum of overlapping resonances was observed below the 10 2 P threshold. A new resonance parametrization was developed in order to handle the overlapping resonances. A new field ionization setup has been developed in order to investigate the photodetachment process in greater detail. This apparatus will enable three new types of measurements: partial cross sections to very highly excited states approaching the double detachment limit; branching ratios to Rydberg states in the same energy range; and near threshold cross sections for the fundamentally interesting double photodetachment process. Initial experiments on the photodetachment of Cs- leading to highly excited states of Cs are presented in this thesis. In addition to the work at GUNILLA, an experiment has been performed on La- at the Department of Physics at Denison University using a crossed laser-ion beams setup. Twelve optically allowed transitions between bound states of opposite parity in La- were observed. One such transition has properties that could make it a candidate for the first laser cooling of a negative ion. If successful, laser cooled negative ions could be used in a proposed process of sympathetic cooling of anti-protons in an effort to enhance the production of anti-hydrogen...|$|R
40|$|El artículo parte de la preocupación de Mies por vestir con distinción y de la elegancia de su obra para ensayar un cruce de correspondencias con la figura del dandi decimonónico y de manera especial con el pensamiento de Baudelaire y su libro El pintor de la vida moderna. No se trata de dilucidar si Mies fue o no fue un dandi o si quiso serlo, sino de {{considerar}} su carácter y, sobre todo, su obra a la luz de algunos de los perfiles que el dandismo aporta a la modernidad; de ofrecer una mirada distinta sobre la posición (individual) del genio alemán en relación con algunas de las cuestiones recurrentes del debate de la vanguardia, especialmente aquellas que hacen referencia a las relaciones entre arquitectura y ciudad. By considering Mies van der Rohe’s {{character and}} his work {{through the lens of}} the contributions of dandyism to modernity, this article offers a different perspective on where the German architect stands in terms of some of the recurring questions in the conversation on cutting-edge design, especially those on the relationship between architecture and the city. Dandyism started in England during the Regency period and was embodied in the slender figure of the young George Bryan “ Beau” Brummell. For many, this idle, sophisticated, ascetic youth – who was also melancholic and cynical – represents the true dandy, whereas later generations, who brought intellectual finesse to dandyism, was merely an adulteration. However, it was precisely with the appearance of figures such as Barbey d’Aurevilly, Oscar Wilde and Charles Baudelaire, who epitomized this ideal of dandyism, that the myth of the dandy took shape as an intellectual option. Of particular interest is the comparison between the dandy’s manners and their meaning and the forms of Miesian architecture. In order to pursue this line of thought, let’s look at two key concepts in dandyism: “ the system” and “ strict rules. ” For the dandy, rules guarantee freedom. By a similar token, voluntary submission to geometry and repetition does not hinder Mies’s creativity. It is his awareness of the limits that makes his work sublime. Mies has been criticized for creating a Platonic universe, a ceaseless, featureless space where life can scarcely be expected to exist. Dandies also attempt to impose their spiritual superiority on the urban masses by following a set of strict rules, as manifested by precise repetition of the same daily rituals, discretion and refined attire. In America, Mies’s most important urban proposal was the design for the new Illinois Institute of Technology campus. His plan was criticized for its apparent lack of communication {{with the rest of the}} city. One criticism of the poetics of Mies’s work is that he avoids reflecting on the context. Instead, he proposes an independent, universally applicable design system apparently unconcerned with the complexity and discontinuity of the contemporary city. However, Miesian reduction can also be seen as a specific response to big cities in terms of order, clarity and efficiency, a systematic repetition that provides security against organic complexity. It is an aristocratic pose that Mies adopts by relentlessly insisting on the same unvarying formula, not out of a sense of superiority or as a stylistic choice, but because of the certainty of the solution. His architectural objects, silent and unyielding, ever beautiful and elegant, can be identified with the figure of the stylish flâneur, who plays the roles of spectator and attraction with respect to the crowds that roam the city. This distinction sets these architectural objects apart from all other constructed masses, just as the dandy’s distinction sets him apart from the crowd. It is based on contention, a formal sobriety that rests on the accuracy of the volumes and the precision of the <b>sections</b> <b>modulating</b> the facades. Dandies achieve it through sober attire and elegant composure...|$|R
