This was eventually adopted with Freightliner. The coal-handling operations of BR were to be significantly modernised; the report recommended the adoption of <b>merry-go</b> <b>round</b> <b>trains,</b> with automated loading and unloading operation while on the move, for bulk industrial coal traffic and the thousands of coal sidings at individual stations for serving domestic coal demand being closed and consolidated into 292 new House Coal Concentration Depots, with mechanised coal handling equipment and supplied by more efficient block trains. Both these policies were successfully implemented. Beeching also recommended further electrification of the West Coast Main Line from Crewe to Glasgow in 1974. Staff terms and conditions were to be improved over time.|$|R

Today many of these structures are gone, but a stroll into some of the now undeveloped areas of the park may have you find some of these mementos of the past. The park now has a public pool, a playground, the only equestrian (bridle) path in the City Park system, various shelters, the Allegheny Observatory, and summertime concerts and movies.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Ward rounds are an {{essential}} activity for interprofessional teams in hospital settings and represent complex tasks requiring not only medical knowledge but also communication skills, clinical technical skills, patient management skills and team-work skills. The present study aimed to analyse final year students’, nurses’ {{as well as}} physiotherapists’ views on a simulation-based interprofessional ward <b>round</b> <b>training.</b> Methods: In two successive passes a total number of 29 final year students, nursing students and physiotherapy students (16 in the first run, 13 in the second) volunteered to participate in two standardized patient ward round scenarios: (1) patient with myocardial infarction, and (2) patient with poorly controlled diabetes. Views on the interprofessional ward <b>round</b> <b>training</b> were assessed using focus groups. Results: Focus group based feedback contained two main categories (A) ward <b>round</b> <b>training</b> benefits and (B) difficulties. Positive aspects enfolded course preparation, setting of the training, {{the involvement of the}} participants during training and the positive learning atmosphere. Difficulties were seen in the flawed atmosphere and realization of ward rounds in the daily clinical setting with respect to inter-professional aspects, and course benefit for the different professional groups. Conclusion: The presented inter-professional ward <b>round</b> <b>training</b> represents a well received and valuable model of interprofessional learning. Further research should assess its effectiveness, processes of interprofessional interplay and transfer into clinical practice...|$|R
