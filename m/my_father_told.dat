25|$|When I was a kid, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> {{me about}} an {{accident}} that happened while {{he was working on}} Grand Coulee Dam in Washington. (At the time, Grand Coulee Dam was the world’s largest dam.) One day, a crane operator failed to see him, swung a quarter-ton bucket of wet concrete into his side, and knocked him off the dam. He managed to reach around in midair, grabbed the bottom rim of the bucket, swung out with it, and when it came back in dropped into the middle of a patch of fresh concrete.|$|E
500|$|Ali Mansour Ahmed Khudair was a 53 or 58-year-old Bahraini {{who died}} on 17February after police shot at his back. He had 91 pellets in his chest. Khudair was a {{fisherman}} from Sitra {{who lived in a}} ramshackle house. He had three sons: Hassan (21), Jaffar (14) and Ahmed (9), as well as an 18-year-old daughter. Jaffar said: [...] "I was with my father in Pearl Roundabout when they attacked. We were asleep at first, when I woke up, I started moving away, but <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> me to endure, stay and not fear. Then we heard screams and rushed there. For a few seconds he spoke to the security forces, asking them to stay away from women and children, but they shot him in the chest. He fell to the ground and I couldn't see him after tear gas cloud covered the place." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trivedi {{has filed}} many petitions. He says, [...] "I was so fed up of {{corruption}} then. I thought I can't progress here. But, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> {{me to learn}} to fight corruption, make your way." [...] Trivedi shot into prominence when he asked the Supreme Court to make the Vohra report on the criminalization of politics in India public. This petition gave a push to the Right to Information movement.|$|E
6000|$|... "You know," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "the {{surest way to}} make people find out the worst is to keep them ignorant. <b>My</b> <b>father's</b> <b>told</b> {{me it was a}} quarrel about property. But I don't believe it; we've both got heaps. They wouldn't have been so bourgeois as all that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hans," [...] I said sternly, [...] "if you lie so hard, {{you will}} {{certainly}} go to hell, as the Predikant, <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> often <b>told</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he answered, [...] "no one. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> only <b>told</b> me {{that the}} name of the little village is Kleindorf. He wrote it on the label for my bag." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> him no--very little company, {{the more}} was the pity.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, it is dreadful!' cried Nuttie, {{sinking into}} a chair. 'Do you remember, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> him never {{to see his}} face again unless he found Alwyn?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I say. But <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> our Matilda, and {{she knows}} what you are. She knows what you're after. So {{you might as well}} clear out, for all you'll get--guttersnipe!' ...|$|E
60|$|Our Lupton uncles came, {{and were}} frightfully shocked and incredulous; at least, Uncle George was. Uncle Lupton himself remembered {{something}} of <b>my</b> <b>father</b> having <b>told</b> {{him of a}} former affair in America.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>father,</b> Jessie <b>told</b> me, was now {{cultivating}} {{more than}} five hundred acres of land, and deeply worried, for his wheat was thin and light and the price less than sixty cents per bushel.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I do, {{and what}} is more, I intend, sooner or later, {{to try to have}} matters mended. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> always <b>told</b> me he wished me to keep on going to school and then to enter Princeton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peter, {{how dare}} you add {{falsehood}} to--to--you know what. Do {{you mean to say}} that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> you to kiss me, and at six o'clock in the morning, too?" ...|$|E
60|$|After a {{considerable}} silence <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> {{me how he}} had met Marx abroad. He had done him some service and they had become friendly. He latterly engaged him as secretary.|$|E
6000|$|... "I came," [...] {{she said}} softly, [...] "because {{it was the}} only atonement I could make. I ought to have trusted you. Do you know, even <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> me that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} {{to have heard}} something of this from <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> who <b>told</b> me at the same time, that the reason why you left your people was to your credit. But you had music in the thicket?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No, I do {{not forget}} Louisa,” said Elizabeth, again {{compressing}} her beautiful lips. “You know, Effingham, that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> has <b>told</b> you that I ruled him, and that I should rule you. I am now about to exert my power.” ...|$|R
6000|$|And as, perhaps, I {{seemed to}} wonder at {{this way of}} beginning, he opened a little, and said, [...] "It is <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> He <b>told</b> me that if ever I came here I was to mind and do his work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{must have}} dreamt it," [...] said Alton gravely. [...] "Or perhaps <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> me. He {{used to talk}} of Carnaby, and I feel I know it well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only knew}} what <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> me, an d what all our friends believed--that {{she had a}} tumor in the neck, or, as I {{sometimes}} heard it stated, from the effect on her constitution of a tumor in the neck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was not all," [...] {{said the}} girl; [...] "it was Lord Tyrrell's {{coming in the}} way. Yes, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> me so; he {{held it up to}} me as an example of what one ought to do for one's family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'From what <b>my</b> <b>father</b> has <b>told</b> me of him, he is not--a more {{desirable}} brother-in-law {{to me than}} I shall be in all likelihood to him. What business has a man of that character to marry Berta, I should like to ask?' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It really cost us a lot. I'm {{talking about}} losing {{furniture}} in the house, having it repossessed {{and things of that}} nature. It was a very terrible period for our family. And <b>my</b> <b>father</b> once <b>told</b> me that if he had had good legal help this wouldn't have happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{why should}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> have <b>told</b> you this, Pathfinder?" [...] the girl demanded a little earnestly. [...] "Perhaps he fancied {{you would think}} the better of me {{if you did not}} believe me a silly coward, as so many of my sex love to make {{themselves}} appear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are such}} jealous creatures," [...] she explained; [...] "they always follow me about, and fly at every dog that comes near me. Poor dog! {{that is the}} one, I suppose, who killed Snarleyow. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> me all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--I {{know it was}} not. But what I say {{is always}} said awkwardly. An hour ago I {{did not know that}} you were in town, but when I was told the news I came at once. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> me." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{stranger}} returned, full of joy, to {{the house}} of the old woman, and that evening was so merry that the princess called to him: 'You seem very cheerful this evening; what has <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> you that makes you so glad?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> should have <b>told</b> me to leave the room," [...] said Marian. [...] "It was Sholto's place to have gone, not mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Lambert went on: [...] "After {{that he came}} every night, {{and soon}} the {{tappings}} began, and finally we got into communication with <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> who <b>told</b> us to be patient and wait and Waltie would speak to us. Then the power took hold of Viola and frightened her almost into fits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All you're goin' to say," [...] said Disko. [...] "All {{dead wrong}} {{from start to}} finish, an' Whittier he's to blame. I have no special call to right any Marblehead man, but 'tweren't no fault o' Ireson's. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> he <b>told</b> me the tale time an' again, an' {{this is the way}} 'twuz." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I {{should never}} have thought of such a thing, Mr. Prendergast, {{if it had not}} been for what <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> me, that my uncle was desperately in earnest about it, and had an intense {{conviction}} that someone watched his every movement." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Father John, av {{you could}} feel all I felt when I first knew the man was dead--when my own sisther spurned me--and when <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> me I was a murdherer, you wouldn't wonder at my flying, av it were only for an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Grace, [...] "I {{suppose it}} cost you {{an effort to}} be firm and I hope it did. You needn't be afraid, though. When <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> me, I understood, and it won't hurt to leave Tarnside; I'm anxious to get away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks, Jethro," [...] Chebron replied. [...] "Should I fly it {{will indeed}} be a comfort {{to have you}} with me as well as Amuba, who has already promised to go with me; but at present nothing is determined. I have seen <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and <b>told</b> him everything, and he will decide for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And with you, dear Colonel Washington, by whom <b>my</b> <b>father</b> always set such store. You don't {{know how}} much he trusted in you. You {{will take care of}} my boy, sir, will not you? You are but five years older, yet I trust to you more than to his seniors; <b>my</b> <b>father</b> always <b>told</b> the children, I alway bade them, to look up to Mr. Washington." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Without a doubt," [...] Wolfenden {{answered}} drily; [...] "in fact Mr. Sabin {{seems to}} be pretty well up in my genealogy. He had met <b>my</b> <b>father</b> once, he <b>told</b> me." ...|$|R
