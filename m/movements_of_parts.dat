Data on such drives is statically twice as safer i.e. such drives crash less.First of all, these drives do not involve magnetic principles. These drives use semiconductors to store data unlike the disk platter used in the Hard Disk Drives. SSDs use the principle of flash drive. It consists of no actual mechanical parts i.e. no <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> is involved. Usually the HDD data is referred to as volatile memory, this really means that when the computer loses power, all the memory is lost. However, in the case of Solid State Drives, there are chips which deliver non-volatile memory meaning the data is stored even when there is a loss of power with the machine.|$|E
5000|$|The {{roots of}} ecomorphology {{date back to}} the late 19th century. [...] Then, {{description}} and comparison of morphological form, primarily for use in avian classificiation, was focal point of morphological research. However, during the 1930s and 40s morphology as a field shrank. This was likely due to the emergence of new areas of biological inquiry enabled by new techniques. The 1950s brought about not only a change in the approach of morphological studies, resulting in the development of evolutionary morphology in the form of theoretical questions, and a resurgence of interest in the field. High-speed cinematography and x-ray cinematography began to allow for observations of <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> while electromyography allowed for observation of the integration of muscle activities. Together, these methodologies allowed morphologists to better delve into the intricacies of their study. It was then, in the 1950s and 60s, that ecologists began to use morphological measures to study evolutionary and ecological questions. This culminated in Karr and James coining the term [...] "ecomorphology" [...] in 1975. The following year the links between vertebrate morphology and ecology were finally established creating the foundations of modern ecomorphology.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} about {{minimizing}} intercellular <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> {{for the formation}} of manufacturing cells using GA approach. GA is a search technique based on the process of biological evolution and has been applied as an optimization method {{for the formation of}} manufacturing cells. Different GA operators and their importance in the optimization of cellular manufacturing have been discussed. A MAT LAB code has been developed for the calculation of different matrices and fitness values of chromosomes. The initial population of possible solutions (chromosomes) is generated randomly and the fitness value of each chromosome is calculated using code developed for the purpose. The next population is generated by the application of genetic operators process is repeated till stopping criteria is satisfied. Total ten populations are generated by the GA procedure and fitness values of different generations have compared graphically with detailed analysis. It is evident that using GA has minimized the intercellular <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> which indirectly improves productivity, profitability and provide competitive edge to the manufacturing enterprise in global environment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCell Formation (CF) is an {{important}} problem in today's automated batch type production systems. It reduces material handling cost, processing time, labor requirement, in-process inventories, number of set-ups, simplifies process plan, and increases quality of product. Manufacturing equipments of automated manufacturing systems are highly multifunctional. As a result, production processes {{can be done by}} multiple process routes. Optimum cell formation can lead to more independent cells and less intercellular movement of parts. Previous research reveals that most of the researchers considered single route, unique volume of parts, non-sequential Cell Formation Problem (CFP). However, intercellular <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> depend on parts volume, sequence of processes, and routes. In this paper, a heuristic approach based on Euclidean Distance matrix is proposed for CF in multiple routes, process sequential and parts volume (included with batch size and number of batches) problems. Computational experiments were performed with five benchmark problem sets taken from the literature and the results demonstrate that the performances of the proposed heuristic in terms of intercellular <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> are either better than or competitive with the well-known existing algorithms...|$|E

40|$|One {{major problem}} in {{cellular}} manufacturing is the grouping of component parts with similar processing requirements into part families, and machines into manufacturing cells to facilitate the manufacturing of specific part families assigned to them. The objective is to minimize the total inter-cell and intra-cell <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> during the manufacturing process. In this paper, a mathematical model is presented to describe the characteristics of such a problem. An approach based {{on the concept of}} genetic algorithms is developed to determine the optimal machine-component groupings. Illustrative examples are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. Indeed, the results obtained show that the proposed genetic approach is a simple and efficient means for solving the machine-component grouping problem. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This paper gives {{descriptions}} {{on various}} methods {{of solving the}} layout problem and describes a novel method based on genetic algorithms (GA) to solve the machine layout problem. Developing a machine layout {{is an important step}} in designing manufacturing facilities due to the impact of the layout to material handling cost and time, and consequently, affects the overall productivity of the shop floor. Poor layout would result in having more parts spending longer time moving from one machine to another, and thus results in increasing material handling costs. In contrast to the block layout, the objective of the machine layout problem is to find the appropriate placement of machines in a cell. The GA-based method developed to solve this uses the objective of minimizing the <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> being processed in the cell...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} a novel low-complexity realtime image-processing-based {{approach to the}} detection of neonatal clonic seizures. Our approach {{is based on the}} extraction, from a video of a newborn, of an average luminance signal representative of the body movements. Since clonic seizures are characterized by periodic <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> of the body (e. g., the limbs), by evaluating the periodicity of the extracted average luminance signal it is possible to detect the presence of a clonic seizure. The periodicity is investigated, through a hybrid autocorrelation-Yin estimation technique, on a per-window basis, where a time window is defined as a sequence of consecutive video frames. While processing is first carried out on a single window basis, we extend our approach to interlaced windows. The performance of the proposed detection algorithm is investigated, in terms of sensitivity and specificity, through receiver operating characteristic curves, considering video recordings of newborns affected by neonatal seizures.

40|$|This book {{consists}} of chapters that focus specifically on single figures that worked on Descriptive Geometry {{and also in}} Mechanisms Sciences and contain biographical notes, a survey of their work and their achievements, together with a modern interpretation of their legacy. Since Vitruvius in ancient times, and with Brunelleschi in the Renaissance, the two disciplines began to share a common direction which, over the centuries, took shape through less well-known figures until the more recent times in which Gaspard Monge worked. Over the years, a gap has been created between Descriptive Geometry and Mechanism Science, which now appear to belong to different worlds. In reality, however, {{there is a very}} close relationship between the two disciplines, with a link based on extremely solid foundations. Without the theoretical foundations of Geometry it would not be possible to draw and design mechanical parts such as gears, while in Kinematics it would be less easy to design and predict the reciprocal <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> in a complex mechanical assembly...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{new type}} of virtual {{cellular}} manufacturing (CM) system is considered, and a multi-objective design procedure is developed for designing such cells in real time. Retaining the functional layout, virtual cells are addressed as temporary groupings of machines, jobs and workers to realize the benefits of CM. The virtual cells are created periodically, for instance every week or every month, depending on changes in demand volumes and mix, as new jobs accumulate during a planning period. The procedure includes labor grouping considerations in addition to part-machine grouping. The procedure is based on interactive goal programming methods. Factors such as capacity constraints, cell size restrictions, minimization of load imbalances, minimization of inter-cell <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts,</b> provision of flexibility, etc. are considered. In labor grouping, the functionally specialized labor pools are partitioned and regrouped into virtual cells. Factors such as ensuring balanced loads for workers, minimization of inter-cell movements of workers, providing adequate levels of labor flexibility, etc. are considered in a pragmatic manner.

40|$|A {{hierarchical}} {{methodology for}} the design of manufacturing cells is proposed, which includes labour-grouping considerations in addition to part-machine grouping. It is empirically driven and designed for an interactive decision environment, with an emphasis on fast execution times. The method synthesizes the capabilities of neural network methods for rapid clustering of large part-machine data sets, with multi-objective optimization capabilities of mathematical programming. The procedure includes three phases. In Phase I, part families and associated machine types are identified through neural network methods. Phase II involves a prioritization of part families identified, along with adjustments to certain load-related parameters. Phase III involves interactive goal programming for regrouping machines and labour into cells. In machine grouping, factors such as capacity constraints, cell size restrictions, minimization of load imbalances, minimization of intercell <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts,</b> minimization of new machines to be purchased, provision of flexibility, etc. are considered.
