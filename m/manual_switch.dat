25|$|Level {{crossings}} in Thailand, and Malaysia {{are largely}} manually operated, where the barriers are lowered using a <b>manual</b> <b>switch</b> when trains approach. A {{significant number of}} crossings are without barriers. Railway electrification in Malaysia has gradually eliminated level crossings in Peninsular Malaysia, replacing those along nearly all upgraded lines with large overhead viaducts or deep underground tunnels, and simply cutting off non-essential crossings outright. Level crossings used to exist along the KTM railway line in Singapore, but these were removed after the closure of Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, and the moving of the KTM railway station to Woodlands Train Checkpoint. But {{there are still some}} that are used on the line between Port Klang - Westport (Pulau Indah). However, it seems like only the level crossing near Port Klang Komuter Station has the barrier.|$|E
25|$|The present {{configuration}} of the shuttle has three tracks coming into the station; the old southbound express track was removed. There is no connection between the northbound local track (track 4) and the other two. Island platforms are located between both pairs of tracks; the southernmost platform is wide, covering {{the area where the}} southbound express track (track 2) had been located. The two platforms connect directly, as tracks 3 and 4 terminate at bumper blocks. The south track (track 1) merges with the southbound local track of the Lexington Avenue Line. This merge is used to supply rolling stock to tracks 1 & 3 of the shuttle train (via a <b>manual</b> <b>switch</b> just west of station to track 3), and occasionally during special railfan excursions. The other three original tracks followed similar paths until the Lexington Avenue Line was extended north, turning this part of the line into a shuttle.|$|E

50|$|The first {{interconnected}} {{traffic signal system}} was installed in Salt Lake City in 1917, with six connected intersections controlled simultaneously from a <b>manual</b> <b>switch.</b> Automatic control of {{interconnected traffic}} lights was introduced March 1922 in Houston, Texas.|$|E

50|$|Rochester Telephone in {{the late}} 1940s faced a severe public {{relations}} problem. Open house events at its <b>manual</b> <b>switching</b> centers in 1949 helped to appease the public somewhat, but soon, tempers rose again, as consumers complained about the company's slow and unreliable service.|$|R
50|$|The Musa {{connector}} (for Multiple Unit Steerable Array/Antenna) {{is a type}} of coaxial ("coax") connector, {{originally developed}} for the <b>manual</b> <b>switching</b> of radio signals.

50|$|In telephony, {{it refers}} to a {{telephone}} exchange {{in which all the}} operations required to set up, supervise, and release connections required for telephone calls are automatically performed in response to signals from a calling device.

50|$|A {{power supply}} unit (or PSU) {{converts}} mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer. Modern personal computers universally use switched-mode power supplies. Some power supplies have a <b>manual</b> <b>switch</b> for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage.|$|E
50|$|The {{most basic}} form of {{mechanical}} motion detection {{is in the}} form of a switch or trigger. For example, the keys of a typewriter employ a mechanical method of detecting motion. Each key is a <b>manual</b> <b>switch</b> that is either off or on. Each letter that appears is a result of motion on that corresponding key and the switch being turned on.|$|E

50|$|These fast motorboats {{were driven}} by one man, to speeds of around 30 knots. They were {{typically}} {{equipped with a}} bow-mounted charge of up to 300 kg of explosives that could be detonated by either impact or from a <b>manual</b> <b>switch</b> in the driver's area. These attack boats also carried two anti-ship rockets mounted on launchers located {{on either side of}} the boat behind the driver.|$|E
50|$|A driver's {{reminder}} appliance (DRA) is a <b>manual</b> <b>switch</b> in {{the driving}} cab of a passenger train. When operated it glows bright red and prevents the driver {{from being able}} to take power. It was introduced in the design and operation of United Kingdom passenger trains in the 1990s in response to a series of railway accidents where train drivers had passed a signal at danger when starting away from a station.|$|E
50|$|Some {{cars have}} a {{freewheel}} that disengages the driveshaft from the driven shaft. This {{happens when the}} driven shaft rotates faster than the driveshaft. For example, Saab used a freewheel system in the Saab 96 V4 and early Saab 99 for better fuel efficiency. It was also used in Saab's two-stroke models {{at the cost of}} engine braking. Some cars, such as the Rover P4, include a <b>manual</b> <b>switch</b> to engage or disengage the freewheel.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{focuses on}} various aspects {{regarding}} Hall Effect sensors’ design, integration, and behavior analysis. In {{order to assess}} their performance, different Hall Effect geometries were tested for Hall voltage, sensitivity, offset, and temperature drift. The residual offset was measured both with an automated measurement setup and by <b>manual</b> <b>switching</b> of the individual phases. To predict Hall sensors performance prior to integration, three-dimensional physical simulations were performed...|$|R

50|$|Automation {{introduced}} {{pulse dialing}} between {{the telephone and}} the exchange, so that each subscriber could directly dial another subscriber connected to the same exchange, but long distance calling across multiple exchanges required <b>manual</b> <b>switching</b> by operators. Later, more sophisticated address signaling, including multi-frequency signaling methods, enabled direct-dialed long distance calls by subscribers, culminating in the Signalling System 7 (SS7) network that controlled calls between most exchanges {{by the end of}} the 20th century.|$|R
