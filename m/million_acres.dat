In addition, Puerto Rico contains El Yunque National Forest.

Idaho also has the greatest percent of its land in national forests with 38.2%, followed by Oregon with 24.7% and Colorado with 20.9%. On maps, national forests in the west generally show the true extent of their area, but those in the east often only show purchase districts, within which usually {{only a minority of}} the land is owned by the Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} has dedicated nearly 2,000 times more acreage to oil and gas leases than to solar development. In 2010 the Bureau of Land Management approved nine large-scale solar projects, with a total generating capacity of 3,682 megawatts, representing approximately 40,000 acres. In contrast, in 2010, the Bureau of Land Management processed more than 5,200 applications gas and oil leases, and issued 1,308 leases, {{for a total of}} 3.2 <b>million</b> <b>acres.</b> Currently, 38.2 <b>million</b> <b>acres</b> of onshore public lands and an additional 36.9 <b>million</b> <b>acres</b> of offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico are under lease for oil and gas development, exploration and production.|$|E

[...] These storages and the interlinks will add nearly 170 <b>million</b> <b>acre</b> {{feet of water}} for beneficial uses in India, enabling irrigation over an additional area of 35 million hectares, generation of 40,000 MW capacity hydro power, flood control and other benefits.|$|R
50|$|The Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna {{is a major}} {{international}} drainage basin which carries more than 1,000 <b>million</b> <b>acre</b> feet out of total 1440 <b>million</b> <b>acre</b> feet in India. Water is a scarce commodity and several basins such as Cauvery, Yamuna, Sutlej, Ravi and other smaller inter-State/intra-State rivers are short of water. 99 districts {{of the country are}} classified as drought prone, an area of about 40 million hectare is prone to recurring floods. The inter-link project is expected to help reduce the scale of this suffering and associated losses.|$|R

5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had been settled on 6.5 <b>million</b> <b>acres.</b> This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 <b>million</b> <b>acres,</b> which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E

5|$|Parliamentary {{enclosures}} {{accounted for}} about 4.5 <b>million</b> <b>acres</b> {{of what had been}} open fields, not counting the enclosure of common land and wild 'waste'. In 1700 roughly half England's arable land was already enclosed; {{by the end of the}} enclosure process, almost all of it was. The revolution in the landscape began in about 1750, affecting about 3,000 parishes, especially in the English midlands. Between 1760 and 1800 there were 1,479 enclosure acts, covering 2.5 million acres; another 1.5 <b>million</b> <b>acres</b> were enclosed by 1844, by more than a thousand further acts. Some counties such as Kent, Essex and Devon were little affected, having largely been enclosed much earlier, often directly from forest or moorland. Many miles of new straight hedgerows were laid to mark out the newly enclosed fields of the midlands; in some areas such as Derbyshire, straight limestone walls were used instead. Many straight new roads were created at the same time. Farmhouses remained in the old villages at first, but new red-brick Victorian ones were often built in the middle of their now enclosed land in due course.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{month of}} the {{enactment}} of this law Harrison authorized the first forest reserve, to be located on public domain adjacent to Yellowstone Park, in Wyoming.

5|$|In {{its first}} two decades, the General Assembly laid the {{foundation}} of the state. They created the framework for the state's public school system, began construction on the State Seminary and of roads {{in the southern part of}} the state. Initially, the General Assembly was faced with low tax revenues. In response to the problem, they created the Bank of Indiana and sold nine <b>million</b> <b>acres</b> (36,000km²) of public lands to finance their projects. The General Assembly relocated the capitol to Indianapolis in 1824, and in 1831 they authorized the construction of the first dedicated statehouse.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} before Cleveland's 1885 inauguration, President Arthur opened four <b>million</b> <b>acres</b> of Winnebago and Crow Creek Indian lands in the Dakota Territory to white {{settlement}} by executive order. Tens of thousands of settlers gathered at the border of these lands and prepared to take possession of them. Cleveland believed Arthur's order to be in violation of treaties with the tribes, and rescinded it on April 17 of that year, ordering the settlers out of the territory. Cleveland sent in eighteen companies of Army troops to enforce the treaties and ordered General Philip Sheridan, at the time Commanding General of the U. S. Army, to investigate the matter.|$|E
5|$|Jatropha is {{native to}} Mexico and Central America and was likely transported to India and Africa in the 1500s by Portuguese sailors {{convinced}} it had medicinal uses. In 2008, recognizing the need to diversify its sources of energy and reduce emissions, Mexico passed a law to push developing biofuels that don't threaten food security and the agriculture ministry has since identified some 2.6 million hectares (6.4 <b>million</b> <b>acres)</b> of land with a high potential to produce jatropha. The Yucatán Peninsula, for instance, {{in addition to being}} a corn producing region, also contains abandoned sisal plantations, where the growing of Jatropha for biodiesel production would not displace food.|$|E
5000|$|The {{river is}} {{extremely}} over-allocated, meaning {{that claims to}} its water far exceed supply. There are more than 160 separate water rights to the Stanislaus River totaling 19.7 <b>million</b> <b>acre</b> feet (24.3 km3), compared to the river's normal flow of 1.1 <b>million</b> <b>acre</b> feet (1.4 km3). About 3.9 <b>million</b> <b>acre</b> feet (4.8 km3) are considered [...] "consumptive use" [...] water rights, meaning that the water would not {{be returned to the}} river. Most of the other rights are for [...] "non-consumptive" [...] uses such as hydropower generation. It should be noted that not all of these rights are in use today (many belong to defunct mining or power companies). Water rights on the Stanislaus River have traditionally been, and are still de jure subject to the prior appropriation method, where the oldest rights-holders get first priority. However, after the completion of New Melones Dam in 1979, and especially due to drought in recent years, federal and local agencies have often been forced to compromise in order to divide limited Stanislaus River supplies between the many demands.|$|R

Her {{paternal}} grandmother, the great heiress Elizabeth Gordon, was suo jure Countess of Sutherland, overseeing estates that spanned 800,000 to one <b>million</b> <b>acres</b> of Scottish Highlands. The Sutherland lands were further augmented with Gordon's 1785 marriage to George Leveson-Gower (later 1st Duke of Sutherland). In 1823, their son George married Lady Harriet Howard, daughter of George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle. Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower {{was born the}} following year as their eldest daughter, on 30 May 1824. Three brothers and two sisters followed.|$|E
5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, {{partly as a result of}} his efforts, The Wilderness Society helped gain passage of the Wilderness Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined {{wilderness}} areas of the United States and protected some nine <b>million</b> <b>acres</b> (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for the wilderness preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana and Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.|$|E
