50|$|Leafhoppers can {{transmit}} plant pathogens, such as viruses, phytoplasmas and bacteria. Cicadellidae {{species that are}} significant agricultural pests include the beet leafhopper (Circulifer tenellus), the <b>maize</b> <b>leafhopper</b> (Cicadulina mbila), potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae), two-spotted leafhopper (Sophonia rufofascia), blue-green sharpshooter (Graphocephala atropunctata), glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca vitripennis), the common brown leafhopper (Orosius orientalis), rice green leafhoppers (Nephotettix spp.), and the white apple leafhopper (Typhlocyba pomaria). The beet leafhopper (Circulifer tenellus) {{can transmit}} the beet curly top virus to {{various members of the}} nightshade family, including tobacco, tomato, or eggplant, and is a serious vector of the disease in chili pepper in the Southwestern United States.|$|E
5000|$|Candidatus Sulcia muelleri is an aerobic, gram-negative, {{bacillus}} {{bacteria that}} {{is a part of}} the phylum Bacteroidetes. [...] Sulcia muelleri is an obligate and mutualistic symbiotic microbe commonly found occupying specialized cell compartments of sap-feeding insects called bacteriocytes. A majority of the research done on Sulcia muelleri has detailed its relationship with the host Homalodisca vitripennis. Other studies have documented the nature of its residency in other insects like the <b>maize</b> <b>leafhopper</b> (Cicadulina) or the spittlebug (Cercopoidea). Sulcia muelleri is noted for its exceptionally minimal genome and it is currently identified as having the smallest known, sequenced Bacteroidetes genome at only 245 kilobases.|$|E

40|$|The <b>maize</b> orange <b>leafhopper</b> Cicadulina bipunctata (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) induces galls {{characterized}} by growth stunting and severe swelling of leaf veins on various plants of Poaceae. Previous studies revealed that galls are induced not on feeding site but on distant, newly extended leaves during the feeding, and strongly suggested that some chemicals injected by the leafhopper affect at the leaf primordia. To approach the mechanism underlying gall induction by C. bipunctata, we examined physiological response of plants to feeding by the leafhopper. We performed high-throughput and comprehensive plant hormone analyses using LC-ESI-MS/MS. Galled maize leaves contained higher contents of abscisic acid (ABA) and trans-Zeatin (tZ) and lower contents of gibberellins (GA 1 and GA 4) than ungalled <b>maize</b> leaves. <b>Leafhopper</b> treatment significantly increased ABA and tZ contents and decreased GA 1 and GA 4 contents in extending leaves. After {{the removal of}} leafhoppers, contents of tZ and gibberellins in extending leaves soon became similar to the control values. ABA content was gradually decreased after the removal of leafhoppers. Such hormonal changes were not observed in leafhopper treatment on leaves of resistant maize variety. Water contents of galled leaves were significantly lower than control leaves, suggesting water stress of galled leaves and possible reason {{of the increase in}} ABA content. These result...|$|R
40|$|The <b>maize</b> orange <b>leafhopper,</b> Cicadulina bipunctata, is a {{multivoltine}} insect that induces galls {{on various}} plants of the Poaceae. A previous {{study revealed that}} galls produced by this leafhopper were induced by dose-dependent stimulation on distant leaves from the feeding site, probably by chemical(s) injected from adults during feeding. In this paper, we examined the gall-inducing ability of C. bipunctata nymphs. The degree of gall induction gradually increased depending {{on the number of}} feeding nymphs and {{there were no significant differences}} from the positive control (feeding by five male adults) when seedlings were exposed to five or more nymphs. These results indicate that both adults and nymphs of C. bipunctata have the ability to induce galls on their host plants, a unique feature among gallinducing insects. This feature may be related to the free-living, multivoltine and polyphagous habits of C. bipunctata...|$|R

40|$|Mortality of the <b>maize</b> <b>leafhopper</b> Zyginidia pullula (Boheman) (Hemiptera Cicadellidae) {{had been}} {{observed}} on maize plants cul-tivated in northwest Italy since the ‘ 80 s of last century. In past research several fungi {{from the dead}} leafhoppers having a sapro-phytic or pathogenic activity were isolated, but only lately Zoophthora radicans (Brefeld) Batko (Zygomycota Entomophthorales) was recognized as the actual pathogen. A research was conducted in 2003 and 2004 {{to find out how}} these fungi infected the leaf-hopper by weekly collecting 30 adult leafhoppers on maize plants and rearing them individually in the laboratory, repeating an unpublished experiment carried out in 1988. Z. radicans was confirmed to be by far the most frequent entomopathogenic agent (8. 2 % of adult mortality in July-October). It appeared in summer and its presence increased throughout the season, reaching a peak in August (even around 50 % of adult mortality). The infestation decreased gradually until the beginning of frosts in Novem-ber. The unusual drought accompanied by high temperatures during the whole summer in 2003 delayed the peak, that occurred at the beginning of October. Furthermore leafhoppers were infected in the laboratory to check the development of Z. radicans, that could complete its life history within four days and a half at 23 °C...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{modification}} of crop plants holds many {{possibilities for the}} improvement of different plant characteristics, or for the simplification of agricultural practices. The most common modifications are resistances against different insect pests on the basis of Bacillus thuringiensis proteins, as well as tolerances against the herbicidal compounds glyphosate and glufosinate. EU directive 2001 / 18 /EC and regulation 1829 / 2003 /EC stipulate an environmental risk assessment for and a monitoring of genetically modified plants. In each single case, a tiered case-by-case assessment has to be carried out, before a GM-plant can be marketed. A development with future relevance for the European market are GM-maize varieties with resistance against the Western corn rootworm Diabrotica virgifera virgifera. This chrysomelid beetle has been introduced from the United States and poses a dire threat to the maize production in Europe. The resistance of maize plants is based on the expression of the Bt-protein Cry 3 Bb 1 in all green tissued. This protein is supposed to be specific against leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae). The potential impact of the cultivation of the Bt-maize variety MON 88017 on non-target arthropods in the maize herb-layer was assessed. The non-deregulated MON 88017, its near-isogenic line DKC 5143 and the two conventional hybrids DK 315 and Benicia were cultivated on a field-release site. Sweep netting, sticky traps, cob and panicle samples were used to survey the herb layer fauna, and were evaluated for their applicability in the context environmental monitoring. The exposure of selected arthropods to Cry 3 Bb 1 was assessed with an immunological assay (DAS-ELISA). A very diverse community of arthropods was found in the herb layer, which in part could be identified as being bound to maize based on published data. Two herbivorous arthropods were of special interest because of their high densities during the 3 field seasons: the <b>maize</b> <b>leafhopper</b> Zyginidia scutellaris and the rice leaf bug Trigonotylus caelestialium. Both species are considerably exposed to the Bt-proteins expressed in genetically modified maize, because of their mode of feeding. This and their wide distribution over the whole of Europe make them candidates for surrogate non-target species in future assessments of genetically modified maize. The statistical analyses showed no negative impact of MON 88017 on the selected non-target organisms. For T. caelestialium, a strong and consistent varietal effect could be shown, however: the two conventional maize lines DK 315 and Benicia were significantly different with regard to the observed field densities of T. caelestialium. This underlines the necessity for ecologically meaningful baselines as references in the assessment of the enviromental impacts of the cultivation of genetically modified plants. This is a challenge for future biosafety research. The methods employed are all suitable for monitoring and surveillance purposes, however, some special aspects need to be considered and merit attention...|$|E
