5|$|With {{the need}} to update Russia's ageing fleet of Su-27 aircraft, Sukhoi and KnAAPO in 2002 started {{integrating}} glass cockpits and improved weapons-control systems (to accommodate {{a greater variety of}} weapons) to existing air force aircraft. The Su-27SM, as the modified aircraft is called, made its first flight in December 2002. The initial success of this project led Sukhoi in December 2003 to proceed with a follow-up <b>modernization</b> <b>programme.</b> Known internally as T-10BM, the programme was aimed at a more thorough redesign of the airframe to narrow the qualitative gap between Russian aircraft and foreign so-called fourth-generation aircraft. The resultant design, also designated Su-35, would serve as an interim solution pending the introduction of the Sukhoi Su-57 fifth-generation fighter, many features of which the aircraft would incorporate. Additionally, the aircraft was to be a single-seat alternative to the two-seat design of the Su-30MK on the export market.|$|E

40|$|Risk {{regulation}} analyses {{the organization}} and institutional settings for risk regulation and regulatory practice. This special issue focuses on risk regulation research with respect to two main areas of health care: infrastructure and service provisions and the risk regulation of critical areas relating to patient safety. This editorial draws {{out some of the}} main themes in risk regulation studies as they relate to these papers. Risk and governance issues consider which risks attract state regulatory responses and how risk debates connect with regulatory policy making. The emergence and reform of risk regulation and governance regimes is examined and varying perspectives offered on the status of experts, expertise and professionals in risk regulation. Many risk regulation initiatives are the result of public sector <b>modernization</b> <b>programmes</b> where the transferability of approaches and tools are taken for granted. How organizations respond to risk regimes {{and the extent to which}} organizations create their own risk regulation regimes thus become a clear focus in this volume. In medical situations, risk regulation may lead to resistance rather than openness and learning. The unintended consequences of risk regulation is an important theme: new financial frames of reference come into collision with other professional perspectives and performance data may be misinterpreted and misused. One strong message is that risk regulation in the UK is in a state of flux and that learning from crises and routine organizational data and experience are crucial in the resolution of the present difficult web of risk regulation initiatives...|$|R

40|$|Technical systems tend {{to undergo}} changes and thus will {{sooner or later}} require {{adjustments}} to new requirements or conditions. Currently, major changes in Air Traffic Management (ATM) are on the way, as ATM <b>modernizations</b> <b>programmes</b> like SESAR or NextGEN are getting momentum. ATM systems are rather complex and pose high demands on safety. Besides safety, other performance parameters like efficiency or environmental and climate impact {{have to be taken}} into account. Here, simulations can help to evaluate advantages of new developments or ideas, without jeopardizing the safety of others. The DLR’s Institute of Flight Guidance operate an Air Traffic Simulation software called TrafficSim, which in detail is capable to simulate realistic aircraft movements and handle scenarios with high traffic. Core of this software is a generic Flight Management System (FMS) which was developed at the DLR within the project PHARE (Programme for Harmonised ATM Research in EUROCONTROL). The purpose of this FMS is to create a 4 D trajectory for each aircraft in the scenario. Data link communication could be used to negotiate trajectories with the ground part of simulation. The TrafficSim is in continuous development and generates configurable as well as realistic 4 D trajectories, or even entire traffic scenarios (e. g. Europe-wide) for various research projects. Since the FMS is capable of most modern FMS-functions like full 4 D, self separation, interval management and low Required Navigation Performance (RNP), all aircraft of a scenario can be individually equipped with a subset of modern airborne capabilities. This paper describes the steps to generate a 4 D trajectory based scenario and shows the scope of the TrafficSim and how projects benefit from this simulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of dairy {{farms in the}} mountainous regions of France was seriously impaired {{by the introduction of}} EC milk quotas in 1984. This effect was particulary noticeable in the Haute-Loire area, where the traditional route into dairying was from veal production. This study examined 30 dairy farms in the region, with a view to establishing the effects of the introduction of milk quotas. For the first 3 yr, these effects were masked by decreases in milk yield attributable to climate and the granting of compensation payments. In the fourth yr after quota introduction, however, all farms had to take action, since the climate favoured higher milk yields. Factorial analysis was used to analyse the profiles of the dairy farms. Farms which had aimed to specialize in dairying, using French Friesian cattle and intensive farming methods, had more difficulty in adapting to the quota system, whereas farms that had conc. on Red Pied cattle and continued to produce veal calves coped better. Future prospects for farms in the region are discussed; the best strategy is perceived to be mixed farming, with moderate intensification, and investment in <b>modernization</b> <b>programmes</b> spread over a long period. / Dans les montagnes de Haute-Loire, la production laitière est relativement récente; elle s'est développée à partir d'un système basé sur le veau de boucherie sous la mère et beaucoup d'exploitations conservent les marques de cette évolution.
