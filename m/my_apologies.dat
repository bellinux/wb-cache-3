Sri Lankan reporter J. S. Tissainayagam was also awarded in 2009 while imprisoned, but was released in time to attend the 2010 ceremony, quipping in his acceptance speech, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, <b>my</b> <b>apologies</b> for being late." ...|$|E
2500|$|The bewilderment caused to {{the public}} about recent revelations has been deeply {{upsetting}} for me and others {{near and dear to}} me. To them, to the Irish people and to this house, I offer <b>my</b> <b>apologies.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 1 August 2016, Bordeaux and Milan {{reached an}} {{agreement}} for the transfer of Ménez. On 3 August, two days after signing for the club, {{he was involved in}} a gruesome incident in a pre-season match against Lorient. The injury occurred in the second-half when Lorient midfielder Didier Ndong inadvertently stood on Ménez's head, causing the former French international to lose part of his right ear in the process. Ménez had only come on as a substitute in the 62nd minute but had to be taken off a little more than 15 minutes later when the incident happened. Ndong offered his apologies to Ménez for his part in the accident, stating, [...] "I offer <b>my</b> <b>apologies</b> to Jeremy Ménez and Girondins de Bordeaux. I give him my full support for the coming days and hope to see him very quickly on the pitches of Ligue 1." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{never heard}} <b>my</b> <b>apology</b> or <b>my</b> entreaty. There {{was a kind}} of glory in her eyes. Looking at her, I found a dimness hazing my sight, and when I rubbed it away it came back.|$|R
60|$|I made <b>my</b> <b>apology</b> for declining his invitation; and I fancy my {{unexpected}} appearance, and hasty retreat, had rather surprised my friend, since, {{instead of}} accompanying {{me to the}} door, he conducted me into his own apartment.|$|R
2500|$|While {{giving a}} {{teleconference}} interview with NBA.com, Nocioni {{spoke about the}} hard fouls and his suspension, [...] "First, the one with Wade was completely my fault. It was a bad reaction on my part. If I had received any penalties because of it, {{it would be a}} fair sanction, but it was not given. However, the sanction set after the game against the Pistons is totally unfair. I see it as a totally real play taken out of context in the game — absolutely nothing happened. It was an accidental blow. Without purposely trying to, I hit him. I apologized on the court. I also asked Carlos Delfino to give <b>my</b> <b>apologies</b> to him, so I don't understand why there is a sanction for something totally normal in a game." [...] In Nocioni's first NBA playoff game, he scored 25 points and grabbed 18 rebounds while playing all 48minutes. Due to his outstanding play, the sold-out United Center crowd in Chicago chanted his name. This game solidified Nocioni's status as a Chicago favorite.|$|E

6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "I have {{to offer}} you <b>my</b> <b>apologies.</b> I have {{apparently}} been deceived by some false information. The charge is withdrawn." ...|$|E
50|$|O Allah! Accept <b>my</b> <b>apology</b> {{and have}} pity on my intense sufferings, and set me free from my heavy fetters (of evil deeds). My Nourisher! Have mercy on the {{infirmity}} of my body, the delicacy of my skin, and the brittleness of my bones.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{ask your}} pardon, Major Drummond. This matter was {{altogether}} my fault. I said that I {{would give you}} a lesson, and you have given me one, which assuredly I shall never forget. I trust that you will accept <b>my</b> <b>apology</b> for the words I uttered." ...|$|R
60|$|I parried her {{questions}} {{by the best}} excuses I could offer; changed the conversation {{for the next five}} minutes, and then, making a sudden remembrance of business <b>my</b> <b>apology</b> for leaving her, hastily withdrew to devote myself to the new idea in the solitude of my own room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Heard something, you know, and {{all that}} kind of thing. Make <b>my</b> <b>apologies</b> to the Duchess. In point of fact I must be in Stamford at ten." ...|$|E
60|$|I rose immediately. Delicacy left me but one alternative--the alternative, {{after first}} making <b>my</b> <b>apologies,</b> of taking my leave. Lady Verinder stopped me, {{and insisted on}} my sitting down again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will tender him <b>my</b> <b>apologies</b> for that," [...] Garnache promised, {{swallowing}} hard, [...] "and if {{he still}} insists upon a meeting he shall have it in, say, a month's time." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now that, not <b>my</b> <b>apology,</b> but <b>my</b> defence is made, I feel my soul respire more easily.

6000|$|... "Not," [...] {{interposed}} Mother Martha, {{nodding to}} show me that <b>my</b> <b>apology</b> need not be finished--"not that it is exactly a relic in the strict Catholic sense of the word; but there were circumstances {{in the life of}} the person who made it--" [...] Here she stopped, and looked at me doubtfully.|$|R
50|$|He also recreated a subtitled {{version of}} Zek's minta maaf (<b>my</b> <b>apology)</b> video, a YouTube {{video of a}} young man named Zek from Brunei {{pleading}} forgiveness to his girlfriend. Tiger re-edited the video and shortened it to 6 minutes, adding an English translation since many of the lines were delivered in Bahasa Melayu (Malay Language).|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must make}} <b>my</b> <b>apologies</b> to your friend; but so good a charade {{must not be}} {{confined}} to one or two. He may be sure of every woman's approbation while he writes with such gallantry." ...|$|E
60|$|Entering Lucilla's room, soon afterwards, to make <b>my</b> <b>apologies</b> {{for having}} {{forgotten}} {{to wait and}} take her letter to the post, I found her, weary enough after {{the events of the}} day, getting ready for bed.|$|E

60|$|July 31.--Employed {{the morning}} writing letters and {{correcting}} proofs; {{this is the}} second day and scarce a line written, but circumstances are so much <b>my</b> <b>apology</b> that even Duty does not murmur, at least not much. We had a drive up to Galashiels, and sent J.B. off to Edinburgh in the Mail. Music in the evening as before.|$|R
50|$|Expressing {{regret for}} his actions, Malcolm {{said he would}} sit on his jail cot {{and ask for a}} sign of {{forgiveness}} from his dead grandmother.

Captain Bartram is just back from Germany, my dear, and is an enthusiastic supporter of our cause.--Sir Everard Dominey." ...|$|R
60|$|I endeavoured with {{hesitation}} {{to throw}} the blame of my rude behaviour upon indisposition--upon disagreeable letters from London. She suffered me to exhaust <b>my</b> <b>apologies,</b> and fairly to run myself aground, listening all the while with a smile of absolute incredulity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Hilditch," [...] he said, [...] "will {{you allow}} me to make <b>my</b> <b>apologies?</b> Your husband and I have arrived at an understanding--or perhaps I should say a misunderstanding--which renders the {{acceptance}} of any further hospitality on my part impossible." ...|$|E
