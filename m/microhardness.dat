25|$|Tooth {{whitening}} or tooth bleaching procedures {{attempt to}} lighten a tooth's color {{in either of}} two ways: by chemical or mechanical action. Working chemically, a bleaching agent is used to carry out an oxidation reaction in the enamel and dentin. The agents most commonly used to intrinsically change the color of teeth are hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Oxygen radicals from the peroxide in the whitening agents contact the stains in the interprismatic spaces within the enamel layer. When this occurs, stains will be bleached and the teeth now appear lighter in color. Teeth not only appear whiter but also reflect light in increased amounts, which makes the teeth appear brighter as well. Studies show that whitening does not produce any ultrastructural or <b>microhardness</b> changes in the dental tissues.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "microhardness" [...] {{has been}} widely {{employed}} in the literature to describe the hardness testing of materials with low applied loads. A more precise term is [...] "microindentation hardness testing." [...] In microindentation hardness testing, a diamond indenter of specific geometry is impressed into {{the surface of the}} test specimen using a known applied force (commonly called a [...] "load" [...] or [...] "test load") of 1 to 1000 gf. Microindentation tests typically have forces of 2 N (roughly 200 gf) and produce indentations of about 50 μm. Due to their specificity, <b>microhardness</b> testing can be used to observe changes in hardness on the microscopic scale. Unfortunately, it is difficult to standardize <b>microhardness</b> measurements; it has been found that the <b>microhardness</b> of almost any material is higher than its macrohardness. Additionally, <b>microhardness</b> values vary with load and work-hardening effects of materials. The two most commonly used <b>microhardness</b> tests are tests that also can be applied with heavier loads as macroindentation tests: ...|$|E

5000|$|Kalanchoe beharensis uses {{a system}} of defense, not unique to this plant, termed stress-limited defence. This system {{involves}} deterring herbivores before a high stress level ensues which causes cracking in the tissue of the plant. High hardness, a structural component of this system is characterized by tissues with high density. Since the tissues of plants employing this defense system have a high density, the defenses, commonly spines, prickles, thorns and hair, must reside {{on the surface of}} the plant.

5000|$|Scratch {{tests at}} low loads, {{such as the}} Bierbaum microcharacter test, {{performed}} with either 3 gf or 9 gf loads, preceded the development of <b>microhardness</b> testers using traditional indenters. In 1925, Smith and Sandland of the UK developed an indentation test that employed a square-based pyramidal indenter made from diamond. They chose the pyramidal shape with an angle of 136° between opposite faces {{in order to obtain}} hardness numbers that would be {{as close as possible to}} Brinell hardness numbers for the specimen. The Vickers test has a great advantage of using one hardness scale to test all materials.The first reference to the Vickers indenter with low loads was made in the annual report of the National Physical Laboratory in 1932. Lips and Sack describes the first Vickers tester using low loads in 1936. There is some disagreement in the literature regarding the load range applicable to <b>microhardness</b> testing. ASTM Specification E384, for example, states that the load range for <b>microhardness</b> testing is 1 to 1000 gf. For loads of 1 kgf and below, the Vickers hardness (HV) is calculated with an equation, wherein load (L) is in grams force and the mean of two diagonals (d) is in millimeters: ...|$|E

50|$|Deposit {{hardness}} {{is one of}} the key tribological {{properties of}} ENP coating technology. Factors that affect hardness are the film composition (%P), the heat treatment temperature and the heat treatment time. Typical <b>microhardness</b> values for the as plated ENP deposits range from 500 to 720 VHN (Figure 8.) This is in contrast to electrolytically deposited nickel, which have typical values of 150-400VHN.|$|E
50|$|High-phosphorus {{electroless}} nickel offers high corrosion resistance, making it ideal for industry standards requiring protection from highly corrosive acidic environments {{such as oil}} drilling and coal mining. With <b>microhardness</b> ranging up to 600 VPN, this type ensures very little surface porosity where pit-free plating is required and is not prone to staining. Deposits are non-magnetic when phosphorus content is greater than 11.2%.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases where}} the {{substrate}} cannot withstand the temperature requirements to achieve maximum hardness, low phosphorus EN is often recommended. The increase in <b>microhardness</b> for ENP films is attributed to the phase transformations that take place during the heat cycle to form nickel metal and nickel phosphide.

50|$|The <b>microhardness</b> of BAM powders is 32-35 GPa. It can be {{increased}} to 45-50 GPa upon alloying BAM with TiB2 or by depositing a quasi-amorphous BAM film. Addition of AlN or TiC to BAM reduces its hardness. By definition, a hardness value exceeding 40 GPa makes BAM a superhard material. In the BAM−TiB2 composite, the maximum hardness and toughness are achieved at ~60 vol.% of TiB2. The wear rate is improved by increasing the TiB2 content to 70-80% {{at the expense of}} ~10% hardness loss. The TiB2 additive is a wear-resistant material itself with a hardness of 28-35 GPa.|$|E

The hardness, yield stress and shear stress increase with the carbon content in TaCx. Tantalum carbides have metallic electrical conductivity, both in terms of its magnitude and temperature dependence.

50|$|Case {{hardening}} is {{specified by}} hardness and case depth. The case depth {{can be specified}} in two ways: total case depth or effective case depth.

This value can be roughly approximated as 65% of the total case depth; however the chemical composition and hardenability can affect this approximation. If neither type of case depth is specified the total case depth is assumed.|$|E

5000|$|The Knoop {{hardness}} test [...] is a <b>microhardness</b> test - {{a test for}} mechanical hardness used particularly for very brittle materials or thin sheets, where only a small indentation may be made for testing purposes. A pyramidal diamond point is pressed into the polished surface of the test material with a known (often 100g) load, for a specified dwell time, and the resulting indentation is measured using a microscope. The geometry of this indenter is an extended pyramid with the length to width ratio being 7:1 and respective face angles are 172 degrees for the long edge and 130 degrees for the short edge. The depth of the indentation can be approximated as 1/30 of the long dimension. The Knoop hardness HK or KHN is then given by the formula: ...|$|E
5000|$|Nanoindentation is {{a robust}} {{technique}} for determination of mechanical properties. By combining {{the application of}} low loads, measuring the resulting displacement, and determining the contact area between {{the tip of the}} indenter and the sample a wide range of mechanical properties are able to be measured. [...] The application that drove the innovation of the technique is testing thin film properties for which conventional testing are not feasible. Conventional mechanical testing such as tensile testing or dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) can only return the average property without any indication of variability across the sample. However, nanoindentation can be used for determination of local properties of homogeneous as well as heterogeneous materials. [...] The reduction in sample size requirements has allowed the technique to become broadly applied to products where the manufactured state does not present enough material for <b>microhardness</b> testing.

5000|$|The {{hardness}} of {{a material}} {{can be measured}} in many ways. The Knoop hardness test, a method of microindention hardness, is the most reproducible for dense ceramics. The Vickers hardness test and superficial Rockwell scales (e.g., 45N) can also be used, but tend to cause more surface damage than Knoop. The Brinell test is suitable for ductile metals, but not ceramics. In the Knoop test, a diamond indenter in the shape of an elongated pyramid is forced into a polished (but not etched) surface under a predetermined load, typically 500 or 1000 g. The load is held for some amount of time, say 10 s, and the indenter is retracted. The indention long diagonal (d, μm, in Fig. 4) is measured under a microscope, and the Knoop hardness (HK) is calculated from the load (P, g) and the square of the diagonal length in the equations below. The constants account for the projected area of the indenter and unit conversion factors. Most oxide ceramics have a Knoop hardness in the range of 1000 - 1500 kgf/mm2 (10 [...] - [...] 15 GPa), and many carbides are over 2000 (20 GPa). The method is specified in ASTM C849, C1326 & E384. Microindention hardness is also called microindentation hardness or simply <b>microhardness.</b> The hardness of very small particles and thin films of ceramics, on the order of 100 nm, can be measured by nanoindentation methods that use a Berkovich indenter.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{influence}} of color opacity and light-curing systems (halogen light vs blue LED) on the <b>microhardness</b> of a composite resin. Methods: Esthet-X composite resin (Dentsply), shades A 2 and A 2 -O, was inserted in a stainless steel matrix (5 mm diameter and 2 mm deep) and was light cured for 40 seconds with a halogen light source (XL 3000; 3 M/ESPE) or a blue LED (Optilight LD II; Gnatus). Eight groups of 15 specimens each were formed, and were further divided according to the light-curing systems, the exposed area (base and surface), and the opacity of the composite resin, producing 120 specimens. The specimens were next stored in distilled water for 24 hours, embedded in a chemically activated acrylic resin, then subjected to finishing and polishing with sandpaper and felt discs. <b>Microhardness</b> was measured with a Vickers Digital <b>Microhardness</b> meter, with a 50 g load for 30 seconds.
