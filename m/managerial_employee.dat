40|$|To {{succeed in}} today’s {{competitive}} business environment, Strategic Human Resource Management (SHRM) should be {{integrated with the}} organisational strategic plan. Particularly, SHRM in capacity building {{should be taken into}} account. This is because SHRM in capacity building can enhance the capabilities of the organisational workforce which is a key value of the organisation in performing better work, as well as increasing the productivity of the organisation. In Laos, there are high numbers of foreign investments, thus investors require a competent local workforce to operate their businesses, especially at the management level. Therefore, if business firms wish to survive in the competitive environment, they should implement the right SHRM in capacity building for their local managerial workforce which is a key success factor for organisations. This research project employs a qualitative approach to study some research questions in capacity building of local <b>managerial</b> <b>employees.</b> The main objective is to examine whether foreign companies in Laos possess the appropriate SHRM in capacity building for their local <b>managerial</b> <b>employees.</b> If they do not possess it, what is the effective SHRM in capacity building for the local <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> that should be designed and implemented? This research study also applies the semi-structured interview as the main data collecting technique with twelve participants from seven foreign companies in Laos. The findings revealed valuable perceptions of HR professionals toward the SHRM in capacity building which provide positive answers to the research questions. All of the participants from foreign firms in Laos possess SHRM in capacity building for their local <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> but its implementation was not executed effectively. From the findings, the effective implementation of outstanding SHRM in capacity building, the so-called localisation strategy, was reported by three participants, whilst nine participants said that there were some obstacles that prevented the implementation and practice of SHRM in capacity building, namely limited budget, less important roles of HRM in strategic level, not sufficient qualification of local <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> and unsuitable specific development programmes. Therefore, to conclude the finding of the research, there is a model of ‘SHRM in capacity building for the local <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> in Laos’ which has been developed by the researcher. This model aims to guide the suitable steps and implementation of the SHRM in capacity building of the local <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> for foreign firms in Laos, to assist them to improve their performance and productivity...|$|R
40|$|Orientation: In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} positive interaction between work and home, {{it is necessary to}} understand the reasons for and strategies used by <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> to manage this interaction. Research purpose: The objectives of this study were to determine, (1) reasons why employees experience high or low positive work–home interaction and (2) strategies that employees with high and low positive interaction use. Motivation for the study: Positive interaction between work and home, particularly in <b>managerial</b> <b>employees,</b> is becoming increasingly more important with a view to ensuring a stable and healthy work–home life. Research design, approach and method: A random clustered sample (n = 275) was taken from <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> in a multinational organisation and the Survey Work–Home Interaction-Nijmegen (SWING) was administered to identify participants with high and low positive interaction between work and home respectively. Thereafter, exploratory qualitative interviews were conducted with selected participants (n = 32) to deduce themes for the above-mentioned objectives. Content analysis was used to analyse, quantify and interpret the research data. Main findings: Reasons for high or low positive interaction were identified in conjunction with previous research. Ten successful strategies for positive interaction between work and home were identified and reported. Managerial/practical implications: Organisational recommendations made include changing the organisational culture to being more supportive, developing employees for future positions and creating social networks.

Design/methodology/approach – Thirty-six in-depth interviews were conducted with <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> in order to examine the topics described above. Findings – It is found that the role of an occupational pension in employees' psychological contracts is related to age, and that they play a much greater role in the psychological contracts of older employees. The provision of an occupational pension was found to be more successful in promoting the retention rather than the recruitment of staff. The <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> interviewed were overwhelmingly supportive of the introduction of the recent Employment Equality (Age) Regulations, but some expressed scepticism that they would be implemented faithfully by their organisations. Research limitations/implications – Further research is needed to examine the impact of the widespread closure of defined benefit pension schemes on employment decisions. The small sample size used in this research means no claims can be made to external validity. Originality/value – The original features of the paper are that the authors apply the psychological contract framework in analysing the degree to which employees value their occupational pensions, employees themselves are interviewed rather than their employers in assessing the impact of an occupational pension on recruitment and retention, and the paper provides an early assessment to the recent introduction of age discrimination...|$|R

40|$|The {{hospitality}} industry has seen rapid growth {{through the last}} three decades. The {{hospitality industry}} in New Zealand is still growing steadily. According to the Ministry of Tourism (2008, para. 3), “Visitor expenditure is forecast (from 2008 to 2014) to increase from $ 13. 73 billion to $ 19. 05 billion per annum, an increase of 41. 4 %” (Ministry of tourism, 2008 b). Therefore, {{in response to the}} needs of the industry, training providers have established a number of hospitality, leisure, travel and tourism degrees (O'Mahony & Sillitoe, 2001). However, previous studies have identified that hospitality management degrees tend to lack importance in the actual world (Harkison, 2004 a, 2004 b; Steele; 2003). Hospitality management students seem to rate the value of their degrees higher than do employees in the industry (Collins, 2002; Raybould & Wilkins, 2005). Therefore, there are gaps between the expectations and assumptions of students and those of hospitality professionals, which have led to problems in the hospitality industry. This study has taken three steps to identify: 1) how career expectations, assumptions and requirements differ between undergraduate hospitality management students and management employees in the hospitality industry; 2) The working histories of <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> and their perceptions of the industry’s needs; 3) Establish the perceived value of hospitality management degrees amongst hospitality management undergraduate students and the hospitality industry. To do so, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken, and questionnaires were collected from 137 undergraduates enrolled in a Bachelor of International Hospitality Management degree at AUT University and 74 <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> in the hotel industry. After an analysis of the data, the researcher examined and compared the results of both groups’ data with relation to the findings of the literature review. The following key points emerged from the research: most students expected that they would work in the hospitality industry after completing their course and supposed that their first work field would be in a Food and Beverage department at a management trainee level. The results of the survey show a match between students’ long-term career expectations and the working history of employees. Students also seem to understand the environment of the hospitality industry well. These results show that students organise well, planning for their future careers, and these results were similar with those of some previous studies (Brien, 2004; Harkison, 2004 b; Jenkins, 2001). The results of this study identified similarities and differences of perceptions between undergraduate students and <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> in the hotel industry. Similarities of students’ perceptions and managerial employees’ perceptions are; •	Commitment is rated as the most important factor in determining success, while personality is rated the most important attribute for an employee in the hospitality industry. •	A degree in hospitality management is not recognised as an important qualification by students or employee respondents. Working experience is more important than a bachelor degree of hospitality management for a prospective employee. •	Students and <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> believe that the hospitality educators know the industry well, although educators and employees have different understandings of career expectations. •	Both parties believe that internship might help hospitality students’ careers in the industry. Differences of perceptions between undergraduate students and <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> are; •	Students believe that knowledge of the industry and experience are the most significant factors for a new employee in the hospitality industry but employees indicate personality. •	Employees believe that using initiative skills are the most important factor for an employee’s career development, whereas students answer communication skills. •	Students believe that a hospitality management bachelor degree will contribute more to the hotel business but employees believe that having three years’ experience will contribute more. •	Students consider that an employee with a bachelor’s degree in hospitality will receive higher starting salaries than someone without, but employees disagree. •	Students suggest that a bachelor of hospitality management degree will affect opportunities for promotion, but employees do not share that opinion. This study found that even if students and <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> share some common opinions, many gaps still exist between them. Therefore, the researcher suggests recommendations relating to students’ expectations and assumptions of their job entry level, the working environment in the hospitality industry, the needs of the hospitality industry, and the value of a bachelors degree of hospitality management. Furthermore, the researcher identifies some limitations of this study and areas for further research...|$|R
