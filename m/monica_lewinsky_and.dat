5|$|The {{missiles}} were launched {{three days after}} Clinton testified on the <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal, <b>and</b> some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.|$|R

5000|$|The 1998 United States House of Representatives {{elections}} {{were part of}} the midterm elections held during President Bill Clinton's second term.

However, the Republican lost five seats to the Democratic Party, but retained a narrow majority in the House.

40|$|Much of the {{literature}} {{in the field of}} Political Science is concerned with explaining voting behavior by legislators. The central research question in this study is what causes changes in voting behavior by members of the United States House of Representatives with regard to social welfare bills? This research focuses on determining which variables sometimes supercede ideology in the decision making process of members of Congress and at what times they intervene. Thus the main hypothesis is: When factors other than personal ideology become more important to the legislator, they will override ideology as the determinant of the vote. The factors that are expected to influence voting behavior besides ideology include: presidential influence; the condition of the economy; the presence of the Iran-Contra Scandal; the presence of the <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> Scandal; <b>and</b> the presence of Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House. The influence of these factors is measured over a time span of 30 years.
