5|$|Natural lead {{consists}} of four stable isotopes with mass numbers of 204, 206, 207, and 208, and traces of five short-lived radioisotopes. The high number of isotopes is consistent with lead's atomic number being even. Lead has a magic number of protons (82), for which the nuclear shell model accurately predicts an especially stable nucleus. Lead-208 has 126 neutrons, another magic number, which <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> lead-208 is extraordinarily stable.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January 2007, Kobasa et al. (2007) {{reported}} that monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) {{infected with the}} recreated flu strain exhibited classic symptoms of the 1918 pandemic, and died from a cytokine storm—an overreaction of the immune system. This <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the 1918 flu had its surprising effect on younger, healthier people, as {{a person with a}} stronger immune system would potentially have a stronger overreaction.|$|E

5|$|Stress has {{effects on}} the immune system, which <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> some cases {{directly}} correlate with stress. It is often stated that ulceration is exacerbated during examination periods and lessened during periods of vacation. Alternatively, {{it has been suggested}} that oral parafunctional activities such as lip or cheek chewing become more pronounced during periods of stress, and hence the mucosa is subjected to more minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} that the filtering capacity of the lung has a threshold radius {{of the size of}} a red blood cell and that sufficiently small decompression bubbles can pass to the arterial side, especially during the initial phase of ascent. Later in the ascent, bubbles grow to a larger size and remain trapped in the lung. This <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> conventional Doppler measurements have not detected any bubbles in the arterial circulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{taking of}} black swans to Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries brought the birds {{into contact with}} another aspect of European mythology: the {{attribution}} of sinister relationships between the devil and black-coloured animals, such as a black cat. Black swans {{were considered to be}} a witch's familiar and often chased away or killed by superstitious folk. This <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> black swans have never established a sizeable presence as feral animals in Europe or North America.|$|E

The policy of the Spanish Match, as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war. Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong flyer, and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also thought {{it would have been}} a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, which <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> its provenance remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|In the aye-aye, {{which has}} {{replaced}} the toothcomb by evolving continually growing, rodent-like incisors, the hook-shaped tip of the sublingua fits precisely within {{the gap between the}} two lower incisors and keeps the area clean. Tarsiers lack a toothcomb, which <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> their sublingua lacks the serrations typically found on the sublingua of lemuriforms. Although colugos also have a toothcomb, consisting of serrated edges on the tips of their incisors instead of finely spaced, elongated teeth, {{they do not have a}} sublingua. Instead, their toothcomb is cleaned by the tongue, which has serrated edges at the front that match the serrations on the incisors.|$|E

5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. An estimated quantity of 0.8 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being absorbed in the tissues. It does, however, sometimes bio-accumulate in tissues that contain silica. One study indicates a possible connection between titanium and yellow nail syndrome. An unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth. This <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> most plants contain about 1 part per million (ppm) of titanium, food plants have about 2 ppm, and horsetail and nettle contain up to 80 ppm.|$|E
5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
5|$|Because of its poor flying ability, {{large size}} and {{possible}} island tameness, the broad-billed parrot was easy prey for sailors who visited Mauritius, and their nests {{would have been}} extremely vulnerable to predation by introduced crab-eating macaques and rats. Various sources indicate the bird was aggressive, which <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> it held out so long against introduced animals after all. The bird {{is believed to have}} become extinct by the 1680s, when the palms it may have sustained itself on were harvested on a large scale. Unlike other parrot species, which were often taken as pets by sailors, there are no records of broad-billed parrots being transported from Mauritius either live or dead, perhaps because of the stigma associated with ravens. The birds would not in any case have survived such a journey if they refused to eat anything but seeds.|$|E

5|$|Budapest Tales {{was even}} less {{successful}} than 25 Fireman Street {{at the box}} office and festivals. According to author David Paul, this <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> Szabó shifted gears even more dramatically in his next film, Confidence (1980), in which historical events are represented straightforwardly, and are filtered through neither memory nor allegory. The film focuses on the relationship between a man and woman who are forced to share a room as they hide from the Arrow Cross {{toward the end of the}} Second World War. It garnered a Best Director award for Szabó at the Berlin Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 53rd Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|The hen flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae) is {{the most}} common flea in their nests. The small, pale house-sparrow flea C. fringillae, is also {{occasionally}} found there and probably arises from the habit of its main host of taking over the nests of other species. This flea does not occur in the US, even on house sparrows. Lice include Menacanthus eurystemus, Brueelia nebulosa and Stumidoecus sturni. Other arthropod parasites include Ixodes ticks and mites such as Analgopsis passerinus, Boydaia stumi, Dermanyssus gallinae, Ornithonyssus bursa, O. sylviarum, Proctophyllodes species, Pteronyssoides truncatus and Trouessartia rosteri. The hen mite D. gallinae is itself preyed upon by the predatory mite Androlaelaps casalis. The presence of this control on numbers of the parasitic species <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> birds are prepared to reuse old nests.|$|E
5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} that carry messages to the brain (afferent nerve fibers) <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the amphipods, {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} isopods are entirely benthic. This gives them little chance to disperse to new regions and <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> so many species are endemic to restricted ranges. Crawling {{is the primary}} means of locomotion, and some species bore into the seabed, the ground or timber structures. Some members of the Flabellifera can swim to a limited extent and have their front three pairs of pleopods modified for this purpose, with their respiratory structures limited to the hind pleopods. Most terrestrial species are slow-moving and conceal themselves under objects or hide in crevices or under bark. The semi-terrestrial sea slaters (Ligia spp.) can run rapidly on land and many terrestrial species can roll themselves into a ball when threatened, a feature that has evolved independently in different groups {{and also in the}} marine sphaeromatids.|$|E
5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E
5|$|It is {{distinguished}} by its position against the French absolute monarchy, support for religious tolerance, including for Jansenism, support for democratic reforms {{such as the}} introduction of parliaments, support for the American independence and the Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791. The newspaper preferred to praise the changes in Poland (the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) more than those in France, criticizing {{the violence of the}} French Revolution, and contrasting it with the peaceful transformation in Poland. This relative lack of support for the French Revolution <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the paper was abolished on 23 April 1798, three years after the invasion of the Netherlands by France and the Batavian Revolution. It reappeared as the Nouvelles politiques publiées à Leyde in October, but it was seen as no longer independent. Under a new name—Journal politique publié à Leyde—it lasted from 1804 until 1811, but it never regained its audience and its quality, and disappeared after the annexation of Holland by the French Empire. A new Leyden Gazette briefly appeared after the liberation of Holland in 1814.|$|E
