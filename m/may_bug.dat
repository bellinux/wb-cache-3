5000|$|The V-1 was {{designed}} under the codename Kirschkern (cherry stone) by Lusser and Gosslau, with a fuselage constructed mainly of welded sheet steel and wings built of plywood. The simple, Argus-built pulsejet engine pulsed 50 times per second, and the characteristic buzzing sound {{gave rise to}} the colloquial names [...] "buzz bomb" [...] or [...] "doodlebug" [...] (a common name {{for a wide variety of}} flying insects). It was known briefly in Germany (on Hitler's orders) as Maikäfer (<b>May</b> <b>bug)</b> and Krähe (crow).|$|E

50|$|On a clear cool day, 12 May 1995, {{the oldest}} living student, the {{academic}} D.S. Likhachev unveiled a memorial plaque—the bas-relief of a <b>May</b> <b>bug,</b> recreated {{by the museum}} and the sculptor S.N. Smirnov. After two days one more plaque appeared on the building, immortalizing {{the memory of the}} presence of the 6th Special Artillery School. The museum, which is located in the former hall of the school's educational council, boasts an exhibit of 15 showcases and 25 stands, reflecting all of the founding stages of the school's 150-year history.|$|E
5000|$|The Hemiptera [...] or true bugs are {{an order}} of insects {{comprising}} some 50,000 to 80,000 species of {{groups such as the}} cicadas, aphids, planthoppers, leafhoppers, and shield bugs. They range in size from 1 mm to around 15 cm, and share a common arrangement of sucking mouthparts. The name [...] "true bugs" [...] is sometimes limited to the suborder Heteroptera. Many insects commonly known as [...] "bugs" [...] belong to other orders; for example, the lovebug is a fly, while the <b>May</b> <b>bug</b> and ladybug are beetles.|$|E
50|$|In 1906, {{after the}} {{retirement}} of V.A. Krakaw, the new director was a selected graduate of the historical-philosophical faculty, the magistrate of Slavic studies Aleksandr Lavrentovich Lipovsky (1867-1942). During the period of his leadership the educational institution experienced two important events. First of all, the school marked its fiftieth anniversary, and to mark the occasion published a unique jubilee collection of former students' recollections. The second event resulted {{from the fact that}} with the school's growing popularity, the space it occupied was beginning to be inadequate. In 1909 a part of building no. 39 on the 14th line was taken over, and according to the plan of master architect G.D. Grimm (an 1883 graduate), a unique new building was built with a bas-relief <b>May</b> <b>bug</b> above the arc of the entrance way. With a great concourse, the dedication took place on 31 October 1910. It was led by the bishop Gdovskii and by Benjamin Ladozhskii, the future metropolitan of Petrograd.|$|E

40|$|In 1919, the Viennese {{cultural}} critic Adolf Loos {{addressed a}} newspaper column to the “ninety percent” of female artists who “call themselves {{that because they}} can batik. ” Bemoaning shop windows filled with batik cloths and neckties, Loos stated: “To the modern human being…batik [is] an abomination. ” Derisively likening the skill required of a batik artist to “drop[ing] a <b>May</b> <b>bug</b> into an inkwell and then let[ting] it crawl around on a prettily dyed, magnificent piece of…pongee silk,” Loos advised practitioners to seek a dry cleaner to “fix” their dye work by erasing it. “The danger is great,” he went on; “that all women will discover the calling to be a batik artist…and so will be withdrawn from economic work. ” 1 Glaring hyperbole aside, Loos’s statements nevertheless speak to the batik technique’s prevalence in Vienna. A craze for batik swept through Europe’s fashionable and artistic centers {{in the first quarter}} of the twentieth century, where it was used across the decorative arts in lampshades, screens, furnishings, and book covers. Batik dyeing requires skillful artistry in combination with fine craftsmanship, which appealed to creatives of the period advocating for a synthesis of the fine and applied arts. This total artwork aesthetic philosophy held particular resonance in Austria, where it was known as Gesamtkunstwerk...|$|E

50|$|The main {{disadvantages}} of custom software are development time and cost. With a spreadsheet or an off-the-shelf software package, a user can get benefits quickly. With custom software, a business {{needs to go}} through a Software development process that may take weeks, months, or with bigger projects, years. Bugs accidentally introduced by software developers, and thorough testing to iron out <b>bugs,</b> <b>may</b> impede the process and cause it to take longer than expected. However, spreadsheets and off-the-shelf software packages <b>may</b> also contain <b>bugs,</b> and moreover because they may be deployed at a business without formal testing, these <b>bugs</b> <b>may</b> slip through and cause business-critical errors.|$|R
5000|$|Beta {{testing is}} done during beta stage of development. Often this {{refers to the}} first {{publicly}} available version of a game. Public betas are effective because thousands of fans <b>may</b> find <b>bugs</b> that the developer's testers did not.|$|R
50|$|Normal {{maintenance}} of software and systems may also cause software rot. In particular, when a program contains multiple parts which function at arm's length from one another, failing {{to consider how}} changes to one part affect the others <b>may</b> introduce <b>bugs.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a {{corporate}} environment, a bug-tracking {{system may be}} used to generate reports on the productivity of programmers at fixing <b>bugs.</b> However, this <b>may</b> sometimes yield inaccurate results because different <b>bugs</b> <b>may</b> have different levels of severity and complexity. The severity of a <b>bug</b> <b>may</b> not be directly related to the complexity of fixing the <b>bug.</b> There <b>may</b> be different opinions among the managers and architects.|$|R
50|$|Severe <b>bugs</b> <b>may</b> {{still not}} be of high priority. For example, a crash (high severity) that happens only rarely may be low priority. Priority is a {{strictly}} increasing function of {{probability of occurrence}} and severity. Given probability p = 1, the severity defines the priority. When p = 0, severity is irrelevant. Low severity <b>bugs</b> <b>may</b> get low priority regardless of the probability of occurrence.|$|R

2500|$|Priority {{controls}} where a bug {{falls on}} the list of planned changes. The priority is decided by each software producer. Priorities are sometimes numerical and sometimes named, such as [...] "critical," [...] "high," [...] "low" [...] or [...] "deferred"; note that these may be similar or even identical to severity ratings when looking at different software producers. For example, priority 1 <b>bugs</b> <b>may</b> always be fixed for the next release, while [...] "5" [...] <b>bugs</b> <b>may</b> never be fixed.
