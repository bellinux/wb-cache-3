5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{represents}} {{the synthesis of}} <b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God. The union of these principles is exalted as the root and womb of all creation. Another view is that Ardhanarishvara {{is a symbol of}} Shiva's all-pervasive nature.|$|E
5|$|The possessive determiners (analogous to English my, his, etc.) {{are used}} to {{indicate}} the possessor of the noun they determine. They mark the person and number of the possessor, and are inflected {{to agree with the}} noun they are attached in number and case. While the English language distinguishes between <b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> singular possessors (his vs. her), late Quenya generally does not.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, in the second-singular, {{inherited}} *-ta -ti {{competed with}} lengthened *-tā -tī for <b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> forms. The expected {{result would be}} -t or -tā for masculine, -t or -tī for feminine, and in fact both variants of both forms {{are found in the}} Bible (with -h marking the long -ā and -y marking the long -ī). The situation appears to have been quite fluid for several centuries, with -t and -tā/tī forms found in competition both in writing and in speech (cf. the Secunda (Hexapla) of Origen, which records both pronunciations, although quite often in disagreement with the written form as passed down to us). Ultimately, writing stabilized on the shorter -t for both genders, while speech choose feminine -t but masculine tā. This is the reason for the unexpected qamatz vowel written under the final letter of such words.|$|E

5|$|Early Old Swedish was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} modern language in {{that it had a}} more complex case structure and also retained the original Germanic three-gender system. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases; besides the extant nominative, there were also the genitive (later possessive), dative and accusative. The gender system resembled that of modern German, having masculine, feminine and neuter genders. The <b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> genders were later merged into a common gender with the definite suffix -en and the definite article den, in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents -et and det. The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.|$|E
25|$|Nouns {{have two}} genders, <b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine,</b> which affect verb concord.|$|E
25|$|Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and {{articles}} are inflected for gender (<b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine),</b> and number (singular and plural). There is no case inflexion, except in pronouns.|$|E

25|$|Direct and {{indirect}} object pronouns also agree in person, number, gender, and case. However, unlike subject pronouns, third person singular and plural have neuter forms, {{in addition to}} <b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> forms.|$|E
25|$|Hittite lacks some {{features}} of the other Indo-European languages, such as a distinction between <b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> grammatical gender, subjunctive and optative moods, and aspect. Various hypotheses have been formulated to explain these contrasts.|$|E

50|$|Spanish {{has three}} forms for the {{singular}} definite article, el, <b>masculine,</b> la, <b>feminine,</b> <b>and</b> lo, neuter. The last is used with adjectives to form abstract nouns employed in a generic sense, {{and also to}} intensify the meaning of adjectives. In Portuguese, there is only o, <b>masculine,</b> <b>and</b> a, <b>feminine.</b> Literary Spanish has also three corresponding third person pronouns, él he, ella she, and ello it (referring to a broad concept, not a named object), while Portuguese has only ele, <b>masculine,</b> <b>and</b> ela, <b>feminine.</b> The Spanish neuters lo and ello have no plural forms.|$|R

25|$|There are two {{grammatical}} genders in Latvian (<b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine)</b> and two numbers, singular and plural. Nouns and adjectives decline into seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative, and vocative. There are six declensions and no articles.|$|E
25|$|When {{referring}} {{to two or}} more {{members of the same}} family and surname, the suffix -ski is replaced with the plural -skich, -scy or -ccy (plural masculine or both <b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine)</b> as well as -skie or -ckie (plural feminine).|$|E

50|$|A Dalmatian noun has {{a gender}} (<b>masculine</b> or <b>feminine)</b> <b>and</b> is inflected for number (singular or plural). The plural is formed with the ending -i for <b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> -e for <b>feminine</b> nouns.|$|R
2500|$|It is only {{in later}} {{languages}} that the binary distinction between [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "weak" [...] nouns become more relevant. In Old English, the n-stem nouns form a single, clear class, but the <b>masculine</b> a-stem <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> ō-stem nouns {{have little in common}} with each other, and neither has much similarity to the small class of u-stem nouns. Similarly, in Old Norse, the <b>masculine</b> a-stem <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> ō-stem nouns have little in common with each other, and the continuations of the <b>masculine</b> an-stem <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> ōn/īn-stem nouns are also quite distinct. It {{is only in}} Middle Dutch and modern German that the various vowel-stem nouns have merged to the point that a binary strong/weak distinction clearly applies.|$|R

25|$|The {{majority}} of this class {{is adapted from}} simple consonant stem nouns. <b>Masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> genders share the same forms, and the neuter may take a strengthened plural form by analogy, or sometimes not use it. The oblique cases are {{the same for all}} genders.|$|E
25|$|The fourth declension {{is made up}} of <b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> nouns. It is {{characterized}} by a genitive singular that is identical in form to the nominative/vocative/dative singular. The singular may end in a vowel or a consonant (usually the diminutive suffix -ín). The most common plural ending is -(a)í.|$|E
25|$|Etruscan substantives {{had five}} cases, and a {{singular}} and a plural. Not all five cases are attested for every word. Nouns merge the nominative and accusative; pronouns do not generally merge these. Gender appears in personal names (<b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine)</b> and in pronouns (animate and inanimate); otherwise, {{it is not}} marked.|$|E
50|$|The weak declension for {{adjectives}} {{is identical}} to the corresponding weak declensions for <b>masculine,</b> neuter <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> nouns.|$|R

25|$|The {{early stages}} of Egyptian have no articles, but the later forms use pꜣ, tꜣ and nꜣ. Like in other Afroasiatic languages, Egyptian uses two {{grammatical}} genders: <b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine.</b> It also uses three grammatical numbers: singular, dual and plural. However, later Egyptian {{has a tendency to}} lose the dual as a productive form.|$|E
25|$|The {{masculine}} {{gender is}} also the indeterminate gender {{as in many other}} Indo-European languages. This means that for an entire mixed group of objects belonging to <b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> genders, the masculine gender is used. The masculine as the indeterminate gender differs from the indefinite gender, which allows treatment of the word in two ways.|$|E
25|$|In John Paul II's teaching, {{homosexual}} intercourse {{is regarded}} as an utilization of another's body, not a mutual self-giving in familial love, physically expressed by the <b>masculine</b> <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> bodies; and such intercourse is also performed by a choice of the will, unlike homosexual orientation, which he acknowledged is usually {{not a matter of}} free choice.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>masculine</b> men <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> women, the Lakota also recognize feminine men, who are usually homosexual, as Winkte.|$|R
5000|$|The Polish {{words for}} a Pole are Polak (<b>masculine)</b> <b>and</b> Polka (<b>feminine),</b> Polki being the plural form {{for two or}} more women and Polacy being the plural form for the rest. The {{adjective}} [...] "Polish" [...] translates to Polish as polski (<b>masculine),</b> polska (<b>feminine)</b> <b>and</b> polskie (neuter). The common Polish name for Poland is Polska.|$|R
