5|$|<b>Major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>{{disorder}}</b> (MDD), {{also known}} simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by {{at least two weeks}} of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present. <b>Major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2–7% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.|$|E

40|$|The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9) is a self-report {{questionnaire}} {{commonly used}} to screen for depression, with ≥ 8 - 11 generally recommended as the cut-off. In Japan, studies {{of the validity of}} the PHQ- 9 and PHQ- 2 have been limited. In this study, we examined the utility of the PHQ- 9 and PHQ- 2 at an outpatient clinic in a Medical University Hospital in Japan. New consecutive outpatients were included in the study. We administered the PHQ- 9 to 574 patients, and acquired complete PHQ- 9 and PHQ- 2 data for 521 patients. <b>Major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders</b> were diagnosed according to the DSM-IV-TR. Forty-two patients were diagnosed with <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders.</b> The mean PHQ- 9 (15. 7) and PHQ- 2 (3. 8) scores of the patients with <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders</b> were significantly higher than the scores of the patients without depression (6. 0 (PHQ- 9) and 1. 8 (PHQ- 2)). The best cut-off points for the PHQ- 9 and PHQ- 2 summary scores were ≥ 11 (sensitivity 0. 76, specificity 0. 81) and ≥ 3 (sensitivity 0. 76, specificity 0. 82), respectively. No relationship was observed between the age and PHQ- 9 scores. The PHQ- 9 and PHQ- 2 were useful instruments for screening for <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders.</b> The best cut-off point for the PHQ- 9 summary score should be ≥ 11 to detect depression in the primary care setting in Japan...|$|R

40|$|Plasma {{cortisol}} suppression following 1 mg dexamethasone {{administration was}} investigated in patients with affective disorders. Twenty-nine depressed outpatients, 8 bipolar depressed inpatients during manic or hypomanic phase, and twelve healthy volunteers entered the study. Depressed patients were divided into 2 groups according to Research Diagnostic Criterio of Spitzer et al. (1978). The first group consisted of 10 patients affected by minor <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders.</b> The second group was formed of 19 patients with <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders</b> (7 bipolar, 12 unipolar). No difference between patients and controls was found in baseline 4. 00 p. m. serum cortisol levels. Healthy volunteers, patients with minor <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders</b> and bipolar subjects in manic or hypomanic phase showed normal suppression. On the other hand, only 42 % of patients with <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders</b> showed suppression. These results suggest that altered response to dexamethasone is a state-dependent phenomenon.

5|$|Pharmacists {{involved}} in CPAs may participate in clinical {{services that are}} outside of the traditional scope of practice for pharmacists. Notably, pharmacists {{do not need to}} participate in CPAs to provide many pharmacy practice services that are already covered by their traditional scope of practice, such as performing medication therapy management, providing disease prevention services (e.g. immunizations), engaging in public health screenings (e.g. screening patients for depressive disorders, such as <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder,</b> via administering the PHQ-2), providing disease-state specific education (e.g. as a certified diabetes educator), and counseling patients on information regarding their medications.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorder}} and <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> {{are the most}} common conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive {{disorder and}} obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E

5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder,</b> inattention and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Dowie {{recommended}} Carlisle to Queens Park Rangers manager Gerry Francis, {{who paid}} a transfer fee of £250,000 to sign him on 25 May 2000. He played his first {{match for the}} team on 12 August 2000 in the 0–0 draw with Birmingham City at Loftus Road. He made a further 31 appearances in the 2000–01 season and scored three times, earning himself a call-up to the England national under-21 team. However, his season was cut short on 31 January 2001, when he suffered his first major injury after a tackle by Rufus Brevett during the 2–0 defeat to Fulham. It was found that Carlisle had torn his posterior cruciate ligament, an injury which kept him sidelined {{for a year and}} caused doctors to believe that his career might be over. While he was out of action, Queens Park Rangers suffered relegation to the Second Division after finishing 23rd in the league. Soon after the injury he attempted suicide, and years later was diagnosed with <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder.</b> Upon his return to football, Carlisle was injured again in a reserve-team match against Bristol City, sparking fears that he had aggravated his previous injury. The damage proved not to be particularly severe, although it delayed his return to training by a further month.|$|E

40|$|Though an {{important}} percentage {{of patients with}} chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) undergoing interferon (IFN) therapy develop depressive symptoms, {{the role of the}} IFN system in the pathogenesis of <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders</b> is not well understood. 50 patients with HCV infection were treated with standard combination therapy (pegylated IFN-α 2 a/ribavirin). IFN-induced gene expression was analyzed to identify genes which are differentially regulated in patients with or without IFN-induced depression. For validation, PBMC from 22 psychiatric patients with a severe depressive episode (SDE) and 11 controls were cultivated in vitro with pegylated IFN-α 2 a and gene expression was analyzed. IFN-induced depression in HCV patients was associated with selective upregulation of 15 genes, including 6 genes that were previously described to be relevant for <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders</b> or neuronal development. In addition, increased endogenous IFN-production and selective hyper-responsiveness of these genes to IFN stimulation were observed in SDE patients. Our data suggest that selective hyper-responsiveness to exogenous (IFN therapy) or endogenous (<b>depressive</b> <b>disorders)</b> type I IFNs may lead to the development of depressive symptoms. These data could lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches to treat IFN-induced and <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
