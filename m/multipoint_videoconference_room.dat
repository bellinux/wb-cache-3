A human factors study aiming at developing user-friendly procedures for the convening of <b>multipoint</b> <b>videoconferences</b> is reported. By means of an experimental laboratory system, test subjects used and evaluated two different setup procedures and a procedure for establishing sub-conferences.

40|$|The use of <b>multipoint</b> <b>videoconferencing</b> in the por-table device such as {{wearable}} computer, {{cell phone}} and PDA, is not popular. While the multipoint videoconfe-rencing requires high computational ability, portable devices always have limited power resource. This paper proposes a framework about a low-power and high-quality <b>multipoint</b> <b>videoconferencing</b> for portable devices. Our approach to obtain such a videoconferencing is that the encoder of a portable device decreases its encoding frame rate if the owner does not speak. On the other hand, the encoder increases its encoding frame rate when the owner speaks. Our experimental results show that we can remarkably reduce the power dissipation using our method...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{multimedia}} synchronisation in fully meshed <b>multipoint</b> <b>videoconferencing</b> applications. This work relies on previous work dealing with multimedia synchronisation in point to point videoconferencing: Up to now, the two main approaches are based on (1) timeline or on (2) temporal intervals composition. But, the first approach is not suited for multimedia data, and the second not suited for multipoint synchronisation. This paper then proposes a hybrid synchronisation solution taking advantage of the two preceding approaches. A <b>multipoint</b> <b>videoconferencing</b> tool based on this hybrid solution, called Confort, has been designed, developed, implemented and evaluated.

The ”Virtual <b>Room</b> <b>Videoconferencing</b> System ” (VRVS) has been developed since 1995, in or-der to provide a low cost, bandwidth-efficient, extensible means for videoconferencing and remote collaboration over networks within the High Energy and Nuclear Physics communi-ties. The VRVS system is based on a Virtual <b>Videoconference</b> <b>Room</b> concept. Since it went into production service in early 1997, deployment of the Web-based system has expanded to include 1940 registered hosts running the VRVS software from more than 40 different coun-tries, and 23 ”reflectors ” that manage the traffic flow, at HENP labs and universities in the US, Europe and Asia. So far, there are 7 Virtual Rooms for World Wide Conferences (involv-ing more than one continent), and 4 Virtual Rooms each for intra-continental conferences in America, Europe and Asia. We review future and ongoing developments (VRVS extension, MPEG 1 / 2 and H. 323 integration, Shared environment, QoS over networks, etc [...] ), to support a set of new and essential requirements for rapid data exchange, and a high level of interactivity in large-scale scientific collaboration...|$|R

40|$|A {{distance}} continuing {{medical education}} programme was established at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium using <b>multipoint</b> <b>videoconferencing</b> via ISDN lines at 384 kbit/s. The sessions, held in the evening, comprised oral presentations followed by interactive questions and answers, and concluded with a multi-site panel discussion. At all sites the session could be followed on two screens. The speaker/moderator or a questioner at a peripheral site, for example, was shown on the first screen and digital images were projected on the second screen. A multi-site voting system was provided. In weekly sessions between five rotating sites, a <b>multipoint</b> <b>videoconference</b> dealing with a different medical topic was presented and treated in a multidisciplinary way. During the {{three years of the}} project, 20 different peripheral sites were visited or revisited. On a five-point scale (with higher scores representing more positive evaluations), the average score for the quality of the image was 3. 72 (SEM 0. 01) and for sound 3. 87 (SEM 0. 01) (n = 3743). The mean rating of the voting system was 3. 76 (SEM 0. 02) (n = 3119). For sound, image quality and the voting system, respectively, 73 %, 65 % and 70 % of all participants gave ratings of 'very good' or 'good'. The older participants gave slightly more positive ratings than the younger ones. Videoconferencing appears to be a suitable alternative to face-to-face seminars. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} {{a system for}} <b>multipoint</b> <b>videoconferencing</b> that offers extremely low end-to-end delay, low cost and complexity, and high scalability, alongside standard features associated with high-end solutions such as rate matching and per-sonal video layout. The system accommodates heterogeneous receivers and networks based on the Internet Protocol and relies on scalable video coding to provide a coded representation of a source video signal at multiple temporal and spatial resolutions as well as quality levels. These are represented by distinct bitstream components which are created at each end-user encoder. Depending on the specific conferencing environment, {{some or all of}} these components are transmitted to a Scalable Video Conferencing Server (SVCS). The SVCS redirects these components to one or more recipients depending on, e. g., the available network con-ditions and user preferences. The scalable aspect of the video coding technique allows the system to adapt to different network conditions, and also accommodates different end-user requirements (e. g., a user may elect to view another user at a high or low spatial resolution). Performance results concerning flexibility, video quality and delay of the system are presented using the Joint Scalable Video Model (JSVM) of the forthcoming SVC (H. 264 Annex G) standard, demonstrating that scalable coding outper-forms existing state-of-the-art systems and offers the right platform for building next-generation <b>multipoint</b> <b>videoconferencing</b> systems...|$|R

40|$|A {{peer-to-peer}} architecture for <b>multipoint</b> <b>videoconferencing</b> is presented.

With the launch of the Virtual Tearoom in 2003, a high-quality <b>multipoint</b> <b>videoconferencing</b> system running on a dedicated gigabit network across Australia, the CSIRO ICT Centre in Sydney lifted videoconferencing to a new level. As a highly specialised application based on this technology, the Virtual Critical Care Unit (ViCCU ®) is used in patient care in hospital emergency departments. Our experience is that in all three application domains, the digital media serves well in its intended niche for telecommunication. Hence, the notion of physical space is becoming less pervasive. Instead, the behavioural framing of the media, i. e., the question of how people adapt the technology to suit their needs and requirements is becoming more predominant. This embraces questions of training, awareness, integration, and connectedness...|$|R

40|$|The great {{diffusion}} of Internet accesses {{in the world}} and the enormous evolution of the Internet technologies have strongly determined dissemination and consolidation of many applications of video content distribution.

The target of this paper is to propose a video distribution platform that is able to provide a huge number of users with a delay constrained multicast video streaming. To this purpose, the proposed content delivery platform is based on a peer-to-peer approach that exploits multicast overlay organization of the peers to address the challenges due to bandwidth heterogeneity.
