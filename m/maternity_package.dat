50|$|The box {{containing}} the package transforms into a crib {{in which many}} newborns have their first naps. A mother may choose to take the <b>maternity</b> <b>package,</b> or a cash grant of 140 euros, but 95% of Finnish mothers choose the box because it's worth significantly more. The <b>maternity</b> <b>package</b> can either be applied for online, on Kela's website, or by completing and returning a form.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{enactment}} of FMLA legislation in 1993, maternity leave coverage was governed by state law, collective bargaining agreements and employer policies. The first set of maternity leave related policies emerged in the late 1960s. By 1969, five states had enacted Temporary Disability Insurance laws protecting employees from income loss in the occurrence of a temporary medical disability. Under this legislation, new mothers were granted leaves corresponding to the benefits that other employees received for temporary illness or disability. This state-level trend of maternity leave legislation continued into the 1970s and 1980s where multiple other states passed more explicit recognitions of new mothers' rights to a temporary leave of absence. Ultimately, 12 states and the District of Columbia had implemented measures requiring at least some private sector employers to offer <b>maternity</b> leave <b>packages</b> to its employees. Even {{in the absence of}} this formal legislation, employees in other states often obtained maternity leave through collective bargaining. Employees frequently held enough bargaining power to influence employer policies and negotiate for the inclusion of maternity leave protection.|$|R
50|$|The Thula Baba Box {{project was}} {{initiated}} by Stellenbosch parents Ernst Hertzog and Frans De Villiers.

50|$|The <b>Maternity</b> <b>package</b> (äitiyspakkaus) is a kit {{granted by}} the Finnish social {{security}} institution Kela, to all expectant or adoptive parents who live in Finland or are covered by the Finnish social security system. The package contains children's clothes and other necessary items, such as nappies, bedding, cloth, gauze towels and child-care products. It was first issued in 1938 to parents with a low income, and contained a blanket, crib sheets, diapers, and fabric which parents could use to make clothing for the baby.|$|E
50|$|Financial aid to {{families}} with children {{comes in the form of}} child allowances, child care and maintenance allowances, and maternity benefits. Child allowances dated from the 1930s, and they were one of the oldest parts of the welfare system. The law in force in the late 1980s was the Child Allowance Act of 1948, which arranged for payments to parents for all children under the age of sixteen and resident in Finland, regardless of the wealth or nationality of the parents. Child-care allowances had been paid since the 1970s to those parents who stayed at home to care for small children or who had engaged someone else to do so. A child maintenance allowance is paid when a court-ordered maintenance payment for a child of divorced parents was not being paid. A maternity benefit, based on legislation of the 1930s, was paid for each pregnancy. It came either as a grant or as a much more valuable set of materials, the <b>maternity</b> <b>package,</b> needed to tend a child. It was withheld if the mother did not visit a clinic by the fifth month of pregnancy.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To determine: (i) the {{national}} status of newborn hearing screening {{services in the}} private health care sector of South Africa; (ii) screening approaches implemented; and (iii) challenges to screening implementation. DESIGN: A descriptive quantitative national survey was conducted {{in the private sector}} of South Africa. METHOD: All private health sector institutions with obstetric units (N= 166) were surveyed telephonically and self-administered questionnaires were subsequently sent to all audiologists in private practice (N= 87) who provide newborn hearing screening services at the units with hearing screening. RESULTS: Nationally 53 % of private sector obstetric units offer some form of newborn hearing screening. Universal hearing screening was only offered by 14 % of units, while the most common approaches were universal screening on some days of the week (18 %) and screening on request (18 %). The most prominent challenge to successful screening implementation was the omission of newborn hearing screening from <b>maternity</b> birthing <b>packages</b> at the health care institutions. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of newborns nationally are not screened for hearing loss, and existing programmes are not sufficiently systematic and integrated to ensure adequate coverage. Hospital management and paediatric health services must prioritise hearing screening as part of standard of care in birthing services. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. An exploratory, cross-sectional, {{qualitative}} {{survey was}} conducted to describe the market of lower income mothers who had recently {{given birth to a}} child in a state hospital in the Western Cape (WC) region of South Africa. These mothers were viewed by the researcher as potential consumers of low cost maternity plans which would provide for maternity care in Active Birthing Units (ABUs) in the private healthcare sector in South Africa. The motivation behind the research stems from various sources. The currently inequitable healthcare system in South Africa, which {{has been described as a}} two tier system in the recent Policy Paper on National Health Insurance (Republic of South Africa, 2011 : 4 - 5), is one such source. Reports of poor maternity care in the South African public healthcare system (Vogel, 2011 : E 1097 -E 1098), is another source of motivation behind the research report. It was apparent to the researcher that given the low quality of maternity care in state hospitals, a potential market of healthcare consumers – who would be willing to pay a small premium for what they considered to be a more acceptable level of maternity care in the private healthcare sector – could exist. This view was supported by research conducted by Joan Costa and Jaume Garcia (2003 : 587 - 599) in which the “quality gap” was confirmed as a driving force behind the demand for private health care. This focus on the lower socioeconomic groups as a market for private sector goods and services was found to be well described by Prahalad (2005). The researcher conducted interviews amongst mothers who had delivered a child in a public hospital in the previous two years. A convenience sample of 100 mothers was selected in a shopping mall in the Western Cape (WC). The researcher administered a structured questionnaire during a face-to-face interview with each of the 100 respondents. The respondents were rewarded with a shopping voucher to the value of 50 ZAR, which was both a prerequisite specified by the management of the shopping mall and consistent with rewards offered in similar studies (Francis, Battle-Fisher, Liverpool, Hipple, Mosavel, Soogun, & Nokuthula, 2011). Data collected from the questionnaire included both data on willingness to pay (WTP), as well as demographic data, which provided interesting insights into a relatively under-researched market segment. A statistical analysis of the data collected revealed that 31 respondents (31 %) reported a positive WTP for private maternity care. A statistically significant relationship was revealed between respondents’ WTP and the birth experience the respondents had had during their most recent pregnancy, whereby mothers who had described their most recent birth experience as “poor” were significantly more likely to exhibit a positive WTP for private maternity care (p= 0. 00006). Significant relationships between respondents' WTP for private maternity care and their age and household size were also discovered, whereby younger mothers were more likely to be willing to pay than older mothers (p= 0. 02) and mothers from smaller households were also significantly more likely to be willing to pay than mothers from larger households (p= 0. 02). Amongst a sub group of 32 respondents deemed to have potential monthly savings, those with a higher monthly household income were more likely to exhibit positive WTP (p= 0. 02753) than were those with higher levels of monthly expenditure (p= 0. 04093). The researcher acknowledged that the limitations of the research included the fact that respondents were selected non-randomly, as a small isolated sample, which made the extrapolation of the results to the larger population of South African mothers impossible. The research did, however, serve to describe the demographic characteristics of a new and relatively under researched target market of mothers from the lower socioeconomic segment of the WC. Data gleaned from this survey will serve to inform further research into this target market, so as to complete a more comprehensive feasibility analysis for the establishment of low cost <b>maternity</b> care <b>packages</b> and ABUs in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|The {{nursing care}} for the woman who has just given birth and for the newborn is {{performed}} {{by a member of}} the medical rescue service team, i. e. by a non-medical health professional. A non-medical health professional is considered a specialized nurse or a paramedic. During his career a paramedic may encounter the ongoing or the completed childbirth out of the hospital environment. He has merely a <b>maternity</b> <b>package</b> and other standard equipment of the rescue service vehicle at his disposal. However, in spite of this handicap, when comparing the hospital facilities, the paramedic must carry out the same professional performance, equally as in other acute situations. It is vital to offer the mother and the newborn the maximum of care and above all, to minimalize the threat to life. His task is therefore to be both theoretically and practically prepared for the childbirth in the field, including the following {{care for the}} mother and for the newborn in the conditions out of a healthcare institution. The bachelor thesis dealing the topic ?Nursing care for the mother who has just given birth and for the newborn in the conditions of prehospital emergency care? is divided into two parts, theoretical and practical. The theoretical part deals with the ongoing delivery with the presence of a paramedic and with the temporary absence of a doctor. Among other points the bachelor work deals with the equipment of the rescue team vehicle suitable for the delivery, with medical examination of the woman, transport of the woman and the foetus in utero (i. e. in the uterus) to the hospital, accomplishment of the childbirth out of the hospital environment and the following nursing care for the woman and the newborn. Due to the complex topic, I deal exclusively with the physiological childbirth, without including all possible complications that might accompany the delivery. The research of the bachelor thesis examines both the theoretical knowledge and the practical experience of the paramedics with an on going childbirth in prehospital conditions, including the following nursing care for the woman and the newborn. In connection with the objectives, the hypothesis has been set ? the paramedics have sufficient theoretical knowledge with on going deliveries including the following nursing care for the woman and the newborn. The quantitative research, the method of questioning and the questionnaire have been applied. As a technique of questioning a printed, standardised and anonymous questionnaire has been used. The data were being collected since February to March 2013. The paramedics from the medical rescue service of the South Bohemia were chosen as a target group, forming together the sample of 102 persons. In order to confirm the given hypothesis, a set of specific seventeen questions focused on the nursing care for the woman and the newborn have been determined. The responses were counted, elaborated by the SPSS program and inserted into synoptic tables. Each question has been then statistically interpreted by the Pearson's chi-squared test. All in all, the adequate level of the theoretical knowledge was proved only in case of ten questions, the rest of the questions did not reach the sufficient level of the statistic importance. Therefore, it results from the research that paramedics do not have sufficient theoretical knowledge; the hypothesis has been then rejected. The reason is probably due to low frequency of childbirth situations in conditions of the prehospital emergency care. This work should serve especially to students and paramedics as a source and the summary of the information needed, mainly in the domain of the childbirth in the prehospital emergency care and nursing care for the woman and the newborn. The results of the research may become an impulse for launching special seminars dealing with both theoretical part and the practical rehearsal for the maternity situations in prehospital conditions...|$|E
