2500|$|Exercise {{training}} on a vibratory platform, also called whole body vibration (WBV) training, has been recently introduced as a training tool complementing standard physical rehabilitation programs {{for people with}} Parkinson’s disease.

[...] However, longer-term (3–5 weeks) WBV programs have not led to improved UPDRS motor scores compared to conventional exercises.

5000|$|Both CIMT and {{modified}} CIMT may {{be applicable to}} up to 20-25 percent of stroke patients, {{and the amount of}} improvement produced by either regimen appears to diminish as the initial <b>motor</b> <b>ability</b> of the patient decreases. [...] Both CIMT {{and modified}} CI therapy {{has been shown to be}} an effective means of stroke rehabilitation regardless of the level of initial <b>motor</b> <b>ability,</b> amount of chronicity, amount of prior therapy, side of hemiparesis, or infarct location. This suggests that plasticity may work irrespective of the pathways in the damaged motor network. Although, due to the duration of this treatment, patients who have suffered profound upper extremity paralysis from their condition are normally not eligible for constraint-induced upper extremity training. A consistent exclusion criterion for CIMT and modified CI therapy has been the inability to perform voluntary wrist and finger extension in the involved hand. As stated above, this criterion typically limits the population eligible for this family of therapies to 20-25% of the entire stroke population.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the structure of morphological and motor characteristics of Croatian first league female football players and their impact on the estimated quality of the players. According to the goal of the research, a sample consisted of 70 Croatian first league female football players. Participants were measured in 18 tests for assessing morphological characteristics, a set of 12 basic <b>motor</b> <b>abilities</b> tests and a set of 7 tests for assessing football-specific <b>motor</b> <b>abilities.</b> Exploratory factor analysis strategy was applied separately to all measured tests: morphological, basic <b>motor</b> <b>abilities</b> and football specific <b>motor</b> <b>abilities.</b> Factor analysis of morphological tests has shown existence of 3 significant latent dimensions that explain 64 % of the total variability. Factors are defined as transverse dimensionality of the skeleton and voluminosity (35 %), subcutaneous fat tissue (16 %) and longitudinal dimensionality of the skeleton (13 %). In the area of basic <b>motor</b> <b>abilities,</b> four factors were extracted. The first factor is responsible for the integration of agility and explosive power of legs, i. e. a factor of movement regulation (agility/lower body explosiveness) (23 %), the second one defines muscle tone regulation (15 %), the third one defines the frequency of leg movements (12 %), while the fourth one is recognized as responsible for the anifestation of basic strength, particularly of basic core strength (19 %). Two factors were isolated in the space of football-specific motor abilities: football-specific efficiency (53 %) and situational football coordination (27 %). Furthermore, by use of factor analysis on extracted latent dimensions (morphological, basic and football specific <b>motor</b> <b>abilities)</b> two higher order factors (explaining 87 % of common variability) were extracted. They were named morphological-motor factor (54 %) and football-specific <b>motor</b> <b>abilities</b> factor (33 %). It is assumed that two extracted higher-order factors fully describe morphological and motor status of first league female football players. Furthermore, the linear regression results in latent space showed that the identified factors are very good predictors of female football players quality (d = 0. 959). In doing so, both specific <b>motor</b> <b>abilities</b> factors and the first factor of basic <b>motor</b> <b>abilities</b> as a factor of general motor efficiency have the greatest impact on player quality, and these factors have been identified as most important predictors of player quality in Croatian women’s first league and elite female football players in general. Obtained results provide deep insight into the structure of relations between the morphological, motor and specific motor variables and also indicate the importance of such definition of specific <b>motor</b> <b>abilities.</b> Consequently, results explicitly indicate the necessity of early, continuous, and systematic development of football-specific <b>motor</b> <b>abilities</b> in female football players of high competitive level but also, adjusted, to the younger age categories...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} whether there is a statistically significant difference in <b>motor</b> <b>abilities</b> of boys and girls in the fifth and sixth grade.

The most significant differences are observable in coordination and explosive strength in favour of boys (p= 0. 00) and flexibility in favour of girls (p= 0. 00). Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that boys and girls differ in <b>motor</b> <b>abilities</b> at the age of 11. Boys are more dominant in the abilities that develop under the influence of physical exercise, while girls show much better results in flexibility.
