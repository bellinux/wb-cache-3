5|$|Despite this auspicious {{start to}} his career, Shearer was only eased {{into the first}} team {{gradually}} and <b>made</b> <b>just</b> ten goalless appearances for the club the following season. Throughout his career Shearer was recognised for his strength, which, during his time at Southampton, enabled him to retain the ball and provide opportunities for teammates. Playing as a lone striker between wide men, Rod Wallace and Matt Le Tissier, Shearer scored three goals in 26 appearances in the 1989–90 season, and in the next, four goals in 36 games. His performances in {{the centre of the}} Saints attack were soon recognised by the fans, who voted him their Player of the Year for 1991.|$|E
5|$|Edwards joined Rochdale on loan {{until the}} end of the 2011–12 season in March 2012. The move re-united him with manager John Coleman, who had managed Edwards for six years at Accrington Stanley. He made his first {{appearance}} for Rochdale a day after signing for the club, on 10 March, coming on as a 61st-minute substitute as Rochdale came back twice to draw 2–2 against Huddersfield Town. Edwards <b>made</b> <b>just</b> three appearances for Rochdale during his loan spell due to a knee injury. At the end of the season, Edwards was released by Stevenage when his contract expired, after just one year at the club. He made 27 appearances during his time at Stevenage.|$|E

5|$|As one on an {{official}} mission, Wright {{would probably have}} offered greetings to Leopold's ambassador extraordinary in London, the Marqués de Lede, and to Alonso de Cárdenas, the regular Habsburg ambassador, who had also been engaged since 1649 in art procurement for the Spanish Monarch. The lack of records means that the timing and duration of this visit remain uncertain. However, de Lede left in late June, and de Cárdenas {{a few weeks later}} – as relations between Cromwell and the Habsburgs deteriorated – so Wright probably arrived back in Flanders, with any acquisitions he had <b>made,</b> <b>just</b> in time to learn of the Archduke's impending departure – and that of his huge art collection – from Brussels in the autumn of 1655.|$|E
5|$|Bautista grew up {{receiving}} {{instruction on}} pitching from his second cousin, Pedro Martínez. The Florida Marlins signed him in 2000 but traded {{him to the}} Baltimore Orioles before Bautista reached the major leagues. He debuted with the Orioles in 2004, appearing in two games before getting traded to the Kansas City Royals. Bautista was ranked Kansas City's number two prospect by Baseball America entering the 2005 season, but he <b>made</b> <b>just</b> seven starts before missing {{the rest of the}} season with an injury. He posted a 5.66 earned run average (ERA) for the Royals in 2006 before getting traded to the Colorado Rockies. He appeared in nine games (all in relief) for the Rockies in 2007, spending most of the year in the minor leagues.|$|E
5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, during a period during a period where both the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds had low {{profitability}} or were losing money. The CNEA <b>made</b> <b>just</b> $70,000 in 1997. He said he was being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing executives that the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, and he would not comment on its future direction. The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate partners to offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 percent increase in admissions, but a large reduction in revenues. According to a city councillor on the CNEA board, the crowding and traffic of the event discouraged potential customers from continuing to visit the event in the final week.|$|E
