5000|$|The SRM has {{wound field}} coils as in a DC motor for the stator windings. The rotor however has no magnets or coils attached. It {{is a solid}} salient-pole rotor (having {{projecting}} magnetic poles) made of soft magnetic material (often laminated-steel). When power {{is applied to the}} stator windings, the rotor's magnetic reluctance creates a force that attempts to align the rotor pole with the nearest stator pole. In order to maintain rotation, an electronic control system switches on the windings of successive stator poles in sequence so that the magnetic field of the stator [...] "leads" [...] the rotor pole, pulling it forward. Rather than using a troublesome high-maintenance <b>mechanical</b> <b>commutator</b> to switch the winding current as in traditional motors, the switched-reluctance motor uses an electronic position sensor to determine the angle of the rotor shaft and solid state electronics to switch the stator windings, which also offers the opportunity for dynamic control of pulse timing and shaping. This differs from the apparently similar induction motor which also has windings that are energised in a rotating phased sequence, in that the magnetization of the rotor is static (a salient pole that is made 'North' remains so as the motor rotates) while an induction motor has slip, and rotates at slightly less than synchronous speed. This absence of slip makes it possible to know the rotor position exactly, and the motor can be stepped arbitrarily slowly.|$|E

In BLDCMs the classical <b>mechanical</b> <b>commutator</b> is replaced by electronic components. The motor consists of a rotor containing permanent magnets and a stator with wound coils, connected in series called phases. A switching device, known as the inverter, converts the DC feeding voltage into an alternating voltage which is fed into the phases.

This literature survey reviews the inner loop (inverter) control algorithms with special emphasis on the influence of these algorithms on the torque ripple. Voltage control is the most simple control, though torque ripple can be considerable. Current control, requiring current sensing and a more complex configuration, can reduce torque ripple, especially at lower speeds.

40|$|BLDC motors find {{applications}} in Automotive (especially) electric vehicle (EV)), appliance and industries {{because it does}} not require <b>mechanical</b> <b>commutator</b> used in traditional motors, replacing it with an electronic commutator that commutator improves the reliability and durability of the motor. Three phase voltage source inverter feeds power to the BLDC motor. It is operated by energizing two of its three phase windings at a time. This makes efficient use of windings and develops higher motor torque. The energization of the stator windings are dependent on the position of the rotor. Hall sensors are used for determining the position of the rotor. Based on the position of the rotor the switching devices in the inverter are commutated for every degrees. The inverter gives desirable voltage and output frequency by controlling the switching times on or off using PWM techniques. There are various PWM techniques, among these sinusoidal PWM method and space vector PWM methods are mostly used today.

40|$|Electric motors consume almost 50 % of the world’s electricity. With {{the cost}} of energy rising steadily, {{industry}} is focused on replacing inefficient constant-speed motors and drives with microprocessor-based, variablespeed drives. This new motor-control technology will reduce energy consumption by more than 30 % compared to the older drives. While these variable-speed controllers add cost to a motor, the forecasted energy savings and increased motor functionality should easily offset those initial expenses within a few years. Popular motor designs The DC motor, brushless DC, and AC induction motor are the popular motor designs used in today’s industrial applications. Each of these motor types has its own unique characteristics, but they all operate on the same basic electromagnetic principle: when a conductor carrying current, such as a wire winding, is located in an external magnetic field perpendicular to the conductor, then the conductor will experience a force perpendicular to itself and to the external magnetic field. DC motors: low cost and accurate drive performance A DC motor {{was among the first}} motor types put to practical use, and it is still popular where low initial cost and excellent drive performance are required. In its simplest form, the stator (i. e., the stationary part of the motor) is a permanent magnet, and the rotor (i. e., the rotating part of the motor) carries an armature winding connected to a <b>mechanical</b> <b>commutator</b> which switches current on and off to the winding. The magnet establishes the field flux which interacts with the armature current to produce the electromagnetic torque, thereby enabling the motor to perform work.

40|$|Before we {{talk about}} {{brushless}} motors in detail, let’s clear up a few points about terminology. The term “brushless ” has become accepted as referring to a particular variety of servo motor. Clearly a step motor is a brushless device, as is an AC induction motor (in fact, the step motor can {{form the basis of}} a brushless servo motor, often called a hybrid servo, which is discussed later). However, the socalled “brushless ” motor has been designed to have a similar performance to the DC brush servo without the limitations imposed by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>commutator.</b> Within the brushless category are two basic motor types: trapezoidal and sine wave motors. The trapezoidal motor is really a brushless DC servo, whereas the sine wave motor bears a close resemblance to the AC synchronous motor. To fully explain the difference between these motors, we must review the evolution of the brushless motor. Fig. 1. 35 Conventional DC brush motor Brushless Motor Operation To turn this motor into a brushless design, we must start by eliminating the windings on the rotor. This can be achieved by turning the motor inside out. In other words, we make the permanent magnet the rotating part and put the windings on the stator poles. We still need some means of reversing the current automatically – a cam-operated reversing switch could be made to do this job (Fig. 1. 36). Obviously such an arrangement with a mechanical switch is not very satisfactory, but the switching capability of non-contacting devices tends to be very limited. However, in a servo application, we will use an electronic amplifier or drive which {{can also be used to}} do the commutation in response to low-level signals from an optical or hall-effect sensor (see Fig. 1. 37). This component is referred to as the commutation encoder. So unlike the DC brush motor, the brushless version cannot be driven by simply connecting it to a source of direct current. The current in the external circuit must be reversed at defined rotor positions. Hence, the motor is actually being driven by an alternating current...|$|E
40|$|Commutation is a {{fundamental}} feature of all DC machines. In conventional DC machines the commutation function is performed by the commutator and brushes. These act as both position sensors and switches. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>commutator</b> has obvious disadvantages. Overcoming those disadvantages {{has been a major}} reason behind the development of brushless DC (BLDC) machines. In brushless DC machines commutation is performed by power electronic devices forming part of an inverter bridge. However, switching of the power electronic devices has to be synchronised with rotor position. Position sensing is therefore an essential requirement. This can be done by using sensors such as Hall Effect devices or a sensorless approach may be adopted. Advantages of sensorless techniques include reduced cost and wiring. The most common sensorless method is based on detection of the zero crossing of back EMF signals. But this technique works only above a certain speed since back EMF is directly proportional to speed. As a result BLDC systems which rely solely on back EMF signals for commutation suffer from relatively poor starting performance characterised by back rotation of up to one hundred and eigthty electrical degrees and large fluctuations in electromagnetic torque resulting from non-ideal commutation instants. This may not be acceptable for some applications and many researchers have attempted to overcome those problems. The aim of this project has been to investigate the possibility of a sensorless technique which does not cost more than the back EMF method but with a performance at start-up comparable with that obtained when Hall sensors are used. Initial investigations led to a saliency based method. Detailed theoretical analysis is presented which shows that the method is insensitive to variations in operational parameters such as load current and circuit parameters such as power device voltage drops and winding resistances. There is a close parallel between it and the back EMF method and this makes it easy to swap to the latter method at high speed if necessary. A starting strategy, relying on saliency related measurements, is proposed which offers starting performance much better than the back EMF method and almost as good as Hall sensor based techniques. Experimental evidence is provided to confirm that commutation instants determined by the proposed method are practically coincident with those obtained when Hall sensors are used...|$|E
