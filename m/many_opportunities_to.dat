She also came {{under the influence of}} Walton Newbold, an older student who later became the United Kingdom's first Communist MP.

5|$|Some {{theories}} {{attempt to}} explain Daily's tempestuous behaviour, {{one of which was}} put forth by Frank Vaccaro in his 1999 edition of The National Pastime. His theory explains that, in Daily's day, except in cases of injury, for a pitcher to be relieved from his position, another player already in the game would have to relieve him, and the pitcher would have to take a position in the field. His physical condition did not allow him <b>many</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> play any other positions, so this compelled his managers to leave him in the game longer, even when his performance was declining. He was allowed to play in the field on several occasions, when the situation warranted it, as he is credited as playing three games in the outfield, two at second base, and one at shortstop.|$|E
