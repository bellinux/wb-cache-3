This was exemplified on a commercial biosourced fatty acid methyl esters mixture, using minimal purification of the substrate, on a 50 g scale.

40|$|Within {{the concept}} of the {{replacement}} of fossil with biobased resources, bacterial polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) can be obtained from volatile fatt y acids (VFAs) from agro-food waste streams and used as an intermediate toward attractive chemicals. Here we address a crucial step in this process, the conversion of PHB to <b>methyl</b> <b>crotonate</b> (MC), which can be converted via cross- metathesis w ith ethylene to methyl acrylate and propylene, two important monomers for the plastics industry. The conversion of PHB to MC proceeds via a thermolysis of PHB to crotonic acid (CA), followed by an esterification to MC. At pressures below 18 bar, the thermolysis of PHB to CA is the rate-determining step, where above 18 bar, the esterification of CA to MC becomes rate lim- iting.

The results clearly display MC inhibition effects on the hydrogenation over the catalysts. However, the degree of MC-inhibition is found to depend on both the Pt dispersion and the support used. For alumina a high Pt dispersion can promote the resistance of the catalyst against MC-inhibition, and even allow hydrogen adsorption to become equilibrated on the Pt surface.

For this purpose, conceptual process design, process modelling, economic and carbon footprint assessments of five conversion alternatives for wastewater-based PHB to MC or MA are performed. The PHB conversion step is modelled based on experimental data for both intracellular and extracellular feedstock. Results show that, despite the lower reaction selectivity of the direct conversion of intracellular PHB to MC or MA, this route is economically and environmentally preferred because no intensive downstream process is required for cell release after wastewater fermentation. The lowest total production costs are achieved when dry intracellular PHB is used as feedstock: 1. 31 €/kg MC and 2. 89 €/kg MA. However, the use of aqueous PHB as starting material leads to minimal carbon footprint due to lower energy demand: 3. 25 kg CO 2 -eq/kg MC and 8. 78 kg CO 2 -eq/kg MA, respectively.

The main products {{were found to be}} methyl butyrate (MB) and methyl 3 -butenoate (M 3 B), resulting from hydrogenation and shift of the C=C bond in MC, respectively. The measured activity for both hydrogenation and shift of the C=C in MC was found to depend on the Pt dispersion where higher Pt dispersion favors the C=C hydrogenation reaction. The effect of reactant concentrations on the activity and selectivity for MC hydrogenation over the Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was examined in detail. Under the investigated conditions, the C=C hydrogenation was found to have a negative reaction order with respect to MC concentration but a positive H 2 order. Further understanding of the MC hydrogenation was provided from H 2 chemisorption experiments over the catalyst with and without pre-adsorbed MC and from transient experiments using alternating MC and H 2 feeds. Based on the present experimental results, a reaction pathway was proposed to describe gas-phase MC hydrogenation over Pt/Al 2 O 3. In order to gain more insight into the reaction, a kinetic analysis of MC hydrogenation was performed by fitting a power-law model to the kinetic data, moreover, dissociative H 2 adsorption on the catalyst was found to be the rate-determining step by comparing the power-law model with the overall rate expressions derived from mechanistic considerations...|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} use of biofuels presents an opportunity to improve combustion performance while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gases and pollutant emissions. This work focused on improving the fundamental understanding of the auto-ignition chemistry of oxygenated reference fuel compounds. A systematic study {{of the effects of}} ester structure on ignition chemistry was performed using the University of Michigan Rapid Compression Facility. The ignition properties of the ester compounds were investigated over a broad range of pressures (P= 5 - 20 atm) and temperatures (T= 850 - 1150 K) which are directly relevant to advanced combustion engine strategies. Ignition delay times for five esters were determined using the RCF. The esters were selected to systematically consider the chemical structure of the compounds. Three esters were saturated: methyl butanoate, butyl methanoate, and ethyl propanoate; and two were unsaturated: <b>methyl</b> <b>crotonate</b> and methyl trans- 3 -hexenoate. The unsaturated esters were more reactive than their saturated counterparts, with the largest unsaturated ester, methyl trans- 3 -hexenoate having the highest reactivity. Two isomers of the saturated esters, butyl methanoate and ethyl propanoate, were more reactive than the isomer methyl butanoate. The results are explained if we assume that butyl methanoate and ethyl propanoate form intermediate ring structures which decompose more rapidly than esters such as methyl butanoate, which do not form ring structures. Modeling studies of the reaction chemistry were conducted for methyl butanoate and ethyl propanoate, for which detailed mechanisms were available in the literature. The new experimental data indicated that literature rate coefficients for some of the methyl butanoate/HO 2 reactions were too fast. Modifying these within the theoretical uncertainties for the reaction rates, led to excellent agreement between the model predictions and the experimental data. Comparison of the modeling results with the intermediates measured during methyl butanoate ignition indicated that pathways leading to the formation of small hydrocarbons are relatively well represented in the reaction mechanism. The results of this work provide archival benchmark data for improved understanding of the dominant reaction pathways and species controlling the auto-ignition of oxygenated reference fuel compounds. These data also provide a path for continued development of chemical kinetic models to optimize practical combustion systems...|$|E
40|$|A brief {{review of}} those aspects of current {{photochemical}} research pertinent to {{the present study is}} given. The work itself is in three sections. Section I is concerned with the photochemistry of the system dimethyl maleate/dimethyl fumarate/acetone. Irradiation of this system produced the cis - and trans - 2, 2 -dimethyl- 3, 4 -dimethoxycarbonyloxetanes (I and II), as well as causing cis ↔ trans isomerisation of dimethyl maleate/dimethyl fumarate. No tetramethoxycarbonylcyclobutane (III) was formed. A mechanistic study of the formation of oxetane was complicated by the simultaneous occurrence of the cis ↔ trans isomerisation of maleate/fumarate. This was overcome by examining the photochemistry of the system at irradiation time zero, before any reaction had occurred. This procedure also eliminated other difficulties inherent in any quantitative photochemical study such as the effects of polymer film formation and of the photochemical instability of the reaction products. A method was developed to evaluate the rates of formation of the irradiation products with precision. Particular emphasis was placed on assessing the errors in these quantities. The approach was to follow the light-induced reactions by means of gas chromatography and to estimate the rates at zero irradiation time by extrapolation using a polynomial least squares fit computer programme. It was found important to allow for fluctuations in lamp-output with time and a photomonitor was constructed for this purpose. Dilute acetone solutions of pure dimethyl maleate and of pure dimethyl fumarate were irradiated. Both quartz and borosilicate glass reactors were employed thus allowing variation in proportion of incident light absorbed by each of the two components. Irradiations of dimethyl fumarate in acetone using quartz apparatus were conducted at three different initial concentrations. The significance of the data obtained was verified by carrying out a material balance check and by investigating the importance of any small amounts of dissolved oxygen remaining in solution after deoxygenation prior to irradiation. From a correlation of the observed rates of formation at irradiation time zero with the light absorption properties of the solution irradiated, substantial evidence emerged that oxetanes were formed by the action of excited maleate and of excited fumarate on ground state acetone. This is the first case reported where evidence exists that oxetanes are formed by a route other than the action of the (n,π*) excited state of the ketone on a carbon-carbon double bond. Other workers have restricted their attention to systems involving unsaturated hydrocarbons. (1) The data presented also indicate that another excited state of maleate (and probably also of fumarate) exists which was active in the cis ↔ trans isomerisation reaction but which did not form oxetane with acetone. An attempt is made to identify the oxetane-forming state with the (n,π*) state and the state active only in cis ↔ trans isomerisation with the (π, π*) state of the unsaturated ester. The further implications of the concentration dependence of these reactions is also considered. Oxygen perturbation methods were used to obtain information concerning the relative triplet energy levels of maleate, of fumarate and of acetone, but although singlet-Â»triplet absorption was observed, no information concerning the chemically significant 0, 0 bands was obtained. Electron impact spectroscopic studies are currently being pursued to this end. Section II is concerned with the photochemistry of acetoxime. Irradiation of acetoxime in cyclohexene for 9 hr. yielded the adducts N-acetyl-N-methylcyclohexylamine (IV) and N-acetyl-N-methylcyclohex- 2 -enyl- amine (V) in 2 % yield based on acetoxime consumed, together with bicyclohex- 2 -enyl (VI) and much polymer. This is the first occasion that oxime/olefin photoadducts have been recorded. Two possible mechanisms were investigated. The first involved the photoisomerisation of acetoxime to N-methylacetamide followed by the photo-addition of N-methylacetamide to cyclohexene to give the observed products. The second was the photochemical formation of a nitrone (VII) which photoisomerised to the oxazirane (VIII) and subsequently rearranged thermally to yield the observed amides. It was shown that neither mechanism was likely. No stable products were isolated from propionaldoxime/cyclohexene irradiation mixtures. Section III is concerned with irradiations involving aldehydes. Dimethyl maleate, <b>methyl</b> <b>crotonate,</b> cyclohexene, styrene, ethyl vinyl ketone, crotonaldehyde and benzene were irradiated with propionaldehyde. One irradiation with acetaldehyde was also conducted. Adducts were observed only from dimethyl maleate, <b>methyl</b> <b>crotonate</b> and cyclohexene (IX, X and XI). The other irradiations yielded products derived from propionaldehyde alone. Competition experiments showed that the active entity involved in these reactions was probably a nucleophilic species derived from the aldehyde. A very close correlation was found to exist between the light induced and peroxide induced reaction and this was taken as good evidence that the same acyl radical species was responsible for both reactions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Currently, most {{chemicals}} and materials are obtained from fossil resources. After use, these {{chemicals and}} materials are converted to CO 2. As discussed in chapter 1, {{this causes a}} build-up of CO 2 in the atmosphere, the main driving force of global warming. In order to reach a sustainable system, biomass {{could be used as}} a resource for chemicals and materials instead. A biorefinery approach, where all parts of biomass are used to its full potential is essential. Taking this into consideration, wastewater streams of current biobased processes could be an excellent source for chemicals and materials. However, wastewater is often dilute and heterogeneous of nature. To overcome these challenges, wastewater rich in carbon can be processed by microorganisms to obtain a biodegradable polyester, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). However, the mechanical properties of this polymer make it unsuitable as polymeric material. Moreover, processing of PHA is challenging. To circumvent these issues, we propose a conversion of the inferior PHA to methyl acrylate and propylene (Figure 7. 1) which can be used in current processing infrastructure. PHA rich cells are obtained from the purification of wastewater. The PHA obtained can be purified and converted to MC (Figure 7. 1, chapter 2) or the PHA rich cells can be used directly (Figure 7. 1, chapter 3). For the second step, the conversion of <b>methyl</b> <b>crotonate</b> (MC) to methyl acrylate and propylene, the catalyst was immobilised (Figure 7. 1, chapter 4). The current state of ethenolysis reaction on biomass was reviewed (Figure 7. 1, chapter 5). The conversion of PHA to methyl acrylate and propylene enables the use of carbon from wastewater streams without the disadvantages related to the direct use of PHA. In chapter 2, the first step of the conversion of PHA to methyl acrylate and propylene was investigated. Since PHA obtained from wastewater exists mostly as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), this was chosen as a starting material for our studies. It was shown that PHB could be converted to MC using methanol at 200 °C [...] MC has the advantage of being immiscible with water, which aids its separation. In chapter 2, the pathway of the reaction was clarified, which was subsequently used to optimise the conditions of this conversion. The conversion of PHB to MC proceeds via a thermolysis to crotonic acid (CA), which is followed by an esterification to MC. The formation of CA is the rate determining step below 18 bar, where above 18 bar this changes to the esterification to MC. A selectivity of 60 % to MC is obtained with a full conversion of PHB with 18 bar being the optimal pressure for the conversion. Microorganisms produce PHA within their cells, which poses challenges to the downstream processing of PHA as the material has to be isolated from within the cells and dried. The isolation and drying of PHB is costly and is responsible for a large part of the production costs of PHA. In order to reduce the costs of PHA for the production of biobased chemicals, the conversion of PHA to MC was tested using whole cells. In chapter 3, PHA rich cells were directly converted to MC using the optimised conditions found in chapter 2. The influence of fermentation salts, water and the presence of valerate monomers in the PHA were studied. It was found that the valerate monomers have no influence on the conversion. Fermentation salts do influence the conversion depending on the salt. Magnesium hydroxide catalyses the conversion of PHB to MC, where magnesium sulphate catalyses the formation of methyl 3 -hydroxybutyrate as side product. The reaction tolerates up to 20 % water, which means that the drying step in the downstream processing of PHA can be significantly reduced. The second step of the conversion of PHA to methyl acrylate and propylene involves an ethenolysis, a cross metathesis of MC with ethylene. This ethenolysis reaction requires a homogeneous catalyst. One of the most active catalysts for this conversion is the ruthenium based Hovey-Grubbs 2 nd generation. However, the required high loading of this catalyst makes it an expensive part of the conversion. In order to enable reusing of the catalyst, immobilisation of the Hovey-Grubbs catalyst was investigated in chapter 4. The catalyst was immobilised inside a metal organic framework (MOF). For this purpose MIL- 101 -NH 2 (Al) was used for its large cavities connected by small openings. This allows the catalyst to reside inside the cavities, while the small openings prevent it from leaching out. The catalyst was successfully immobilised using a mechanochemical approach. This method can be applied on other catalysts as well, which was shown by the immobilisation of Zhan catalyst. Both immobilised catalysts show metathesis activity for multiple reaction cycles. It was found that the MOF, MIL- 101 -NH 2 (Al), partially undergoes a structural change to form MIL- 53 -NH 2 (Al). When MIL- 53 -NH 2 (Al) was used as starting MOF the catalyst was trapped but inactive. It was concluded that when starting from MIL- 101 -NH 2 (Al), the catalyst trapped in the parts of the material that was converted to MIL- 53 -NH 2 (Al) are catalytically inactive. To investigate the current state of the art of the use of ethenolysis on biomass, a literature review was performed in chapter 5. The results of the ethenolysis of methyl oleate (MO) were compared in order to investigate the most important parameters. It was found that the purity of the ethylene feed has the biggest influence on the turn over numbers (TONs) and that a higher purity ethylene has shown a larger impact on the ethenolysis of MO than the development of novel catalysts. When electron poor substrates are used, the highest TONs are obtained with the less stable Hoveyda-Grubbs 2 nd generation. However, no studies were performed on the influence of ethylene purity on these reactions and higher TONs may be achieved using a higher purity ethylene. In chapter 6, the results and conclusions of the thesis are summarised. The implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions for further research within the field are given.    ...|$|E
