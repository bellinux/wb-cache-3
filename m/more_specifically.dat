The ruling was later overturned by the Supreme Court of Arbitration of Russia in 2007, but it gave Yukos Capital {{a chance to}} take its case to a Dutch court which also ordered Rosneft to pay up.|$|R

5|$|George Mackey {{had asked}} whether Born's rule is a {{necessary}} consequence of {{a particular set of}} axioms for quantum mechanics, and <b>more</b> <b>specifically</b> whether every measure on the lattice of projections of a Hilbert space can be defined by a positive operator with unit trace. Though Richard Kadison proved this was false for two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, Gleason's theorem (published 1957) shows it to be true for higher dimensions.|$|E
5|$|H. erectus {{arrived in}} Eurasia {{approximately}} 1.8 million years ago, in an event {{considered to be}} the first African exodus. There is evidence that the Java population of H. erectus lived in an ever-wet forest habitat. <b>More</b> <b>specifically</b> the environment resembled a savannah, but was likely regularly inundated ("hydromorphic savanna"). The plants found at the Trinil excavation site included grass (Poaceae), ferns, Ficus, and Indigofera, which are typical of lowland rainforest.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. <b>More</b> <b>specifically,</b> the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E

5|$|Majungasaurus, being {{known from}} many well-preserved {{specimens}} of different ages, is well studied {{in regards to}} its growth and development. Throughout ontogeny, the skull of Majungasaurus (<b>more</b> <b>specifically,</b> the jugal, postorbital, and quadratojugal) seems to have become taller and more robust; additionally, the skull bones became more fused and the eye sockets became proportionally smaller. This indicates a shift in dietary preferences between juveniles and adults.|$|E
5|$|Males’ sexual {{maturation}} is triggered by an increased proportion {{of light in}} the photoperiod, such that they are sexually mature when they colonize the field when the crop reaches leaf development. <b>More</b> <b>specifically,</b> a day length of 16h is required for the weevils to terminate their reproductive diapause. An optimal day length of 18h is found to induce diapause termination.|$|E

5|$|<b>More</b> <b>specifically,</b> for example, Nancy Folbre {{examines}} {{the role of}} children as public goods and how the non-market labor of parents contributes {{to the development of}} human capital as a public service. In this sense, children are positive externality which is under-invested according to traditional analysis. Folbre indicates that this oversight partially results from failing to properly examine non-market activities.|$|E
5|$|Prosody is {{the study}} of the meter, rhythm, and {{intonation}} of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used <b>more</b> <b>specifically</b> to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.|$|E
