30|$|Global CO 2 {{emissions}} from transport are 9000 billion tons, which is 18 % of man-made emissions {{and these are}} expected to grow by 60 % until 2050 [20]. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [19], {{emissions from}} transport may grow faster than on any other sector without aggressive and sustained emission reduction measures. In Finland, transport emitted 12.6  Mt of CO 2 equivalent, which was 21 % of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2016 [39]. As an EU <b>member</b> <b>state,</b> <b>Finland</b> is committed to reduce GHG emissions by at least 40 % by 2030, while the long-term target is at least 80 % decrease by 2050, compared to emissions in 1990 [10, 30]. The emission reduction targets for transport are even stricter, with a 50 % reduction target from 2005 level by 2030 and “over the long term, transitioning into a transport system with extremely low emissions” [33]. Hence, there is an urgent need for identifying, evaluating and promoting measures with which emissions from transport can be reduced cost-efficiently.|$|E

40|$|Europe {{has responded}} today to {{concerns}} {{over the use of}} the stimulant drug 4 -methylamphetamine (4 -MA) by subjecting it to ‘control measures and criminal penalties’ throughout the Union. The Decision of the Council of the EU (1) was adopted in the final stage of the three-step legal procedure designed to respond to potentially threatening new psychoactive drugs entering the market (2). The Council Decision is based on the findings of a formal risk-assessment report on 4 -MA produced in 2012 by the extended Scientific Committee of the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), with participation of additional experts from the EU Member States, European Commission, Europol and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (3). The report, submitted to the Commission and Council in November 2012, assessed the health and social risks of the drug as well as international trafficking and the involvement of organised crime. 4 -MA belongs to the group of synthetic phenethylamines and is closely related to amphetamine. It has no established medical value and has no known legitimate purpose, aside from limited use in scientific research. The drug appears to be sold on the illicit market as amphetamine, being frequently mixed with it. Available information suggests that it is produced and distributed by the same organised crime groups involved in the manufacture and trafficking of amphetamine. The Council Decision states that the evidence available provides ‘sufficient grounds for subjecting 4 -methyl-amphetamine to control measures across the Union’. Reasons for the conclusion include: the drug’s strong similarity to amphetamine and the health risks it poses. The risk-assessment report detailed 21 fatalities (4) in four EU Member States (Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, UK), where 4 -MA was detected in post-mortem samples, either alone or in combination with other substances (particularly amphetamine). The adverse effects of 4 -MA include: hyperthermia, hypertension, anorexia, nausea, paranoia and anxiety. Eight EU Member States (Denmark, Germany, Ireland, France, Cyprus, Lithuania, Netherlands, UK) already control 4 -MA under drug control legislation (four doing so via generic legislation on phenethylamines). In addition, two countries (Hungary and Austria) have introduced new legal frameworks to prohibit the unauthorised supply of individual or groups of substances (4 -MA is controlled under the generic definition of phenethylamines).

40|$|In {{very general}} terms, this report {{deals with the}} {{prospect}} of Russia becoming more closely integrated into Europe and into the world economy more generally. In a more restricted sense, it tries to illustrate some of the central issues of this theme by briefly reviewing three sectors of economic activity in Russia, namely international road transport, ports, and forestry. The report focuses in particular on Russian strategies, policies and decision-making in these fields, having Northwest Russia (and its borders with the EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>Finland</b> and the Baltic States) as a particular point of territorial reference. In the conclusions, the focus is placed squarely on the implications of this analysis for the whole European Union (EU), <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and EU-based companies. It is argued here that while Russia's declared goal is to enhance integration, at the same time its policies are clearly characterized by state-regulated protectionism.

The research uses a historical institutionalist perspective combined with a model that identifies primary task characteristics as a source of significant variation. Thus the design explores both the influence of task characteristics (through contrasts among the four different functions) and embedded national system characteristics (through contrasts among the four countries). I show that both primary task characteristics and national system characteristics had some of the theoretically predicted effects on the management regimes. Equally, however, certain general tendencies embraced all countries and most functions. These include, first, the incremental growth of more sophisticated performance indicator systems and, second, the feebleness of ministries in developing performance-based strategic steering. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The EU spends {{only about}} half as much on R&D in ICT as the US. This holds true both in {{absolute}} amounts and relative {{to the size of}} the economy. Indeed, the ICT sector alone is responsible for as much of the overall R&D investment gap as all other sectors combined. From the current data analysis, there are no signs of the ICT R&D investment gap closing. At ICT sector level, the R&D investment gap exists partly because the ICT sector is smaller in the EU than in the US and partly because of the lower R&D intensity of the sector in the EU. The lower R&D intensity is, in turn, primarily due to two sub-sectors: computer services and software on the one hand, and electronic measurement instruments on the other hand. On the positive side, and contrary to the rest of the ICT sector, these two sub-sectors also show strong R&D growth in the EU. Company data indicates that EU companies have R&D intensities similar to their US counterparts in every sub-sector, but are concentrated in less R&D intensive sub-sectors (e. g. telecom services). The US companies are also larger and more numerous in most sub-sectors. These data suggest that the ICT R&D gap between the US and the EU reflects, more than anything, a lack of European firms in the ICT sector. Among the <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> <b>Finland</b> and Sweden make the highest R&D effort in this sector, relative to their size.

In contrast to the initial hypothesis, the analysis of planning practice has shown that the role of spatial planning in risk assessment and management in many ways has been overestimated.

Further, multi-risk assessment approaches are not used in planning practice, risk indicators are hardly used and vulnerability indicators are not at all used.

It follows the general template by presenting the history and politics of the European issue in these countries, their efforts at influencing EU level policy-making, and how the EU level impacts on their politics, institutions and policies. Basically, two theoretical perspectives are introduced in order to interpret EU-member state relationships. From an intergovernmental perspective, a member country is supposed to act coherently on the European scene, and its integrity is notseriously threatened by international cooperation. However, from an organisational perspective, international and supranational institutions might be organised {{in such a way that}} they encourage cooperation and conflict across nation-states, for example, along sectoral, functional, partisan and ideological lines.
