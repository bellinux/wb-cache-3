5000|$|On August 16, 2017, US District Court Judge David Hayes {{rejected}} AT&T's {{arguments and}} {{threw out the}} lawsuit. [...] "A one-touch <b>make-ready</b> approach inherently regulates public rights-of-way because it reduces the number of encumbrances or burdens placed on public rights-of-way," [...] Hale wrote. [...] "The one-touch <b>make-ready</b> ordinance requires that all necessary <b>make-ready</b> work be performed by a single crew, lessening the impact of <b>make-ready</b> work on public rights-of-way." [...] Hale also ruled that FCC guidelines do not apply in Kentucky, as the state exempted itself from those laws.|$|E
50|$|A <b>make-ready</b> is the {{preparatory work}} {{carried out by}} the pressmen to get the {{printing}} press up to the required quality of impression. Included in <b>make-ready</b> is the time taken to mount the plate onto the machine, clean up any mess from the previous job, and get the press up to speed. As soon as the pressman decides that the printing is correct, all the <b>make-ready</b> sheets will be discarded, and the press will start making books. Similar make readies take place in the folding and binding areas, each involving spoilage of paper.|$|E
50|$|Nashville's OTMR {{ordinance}} {{is unique}} in that it includes a clause which requires a company wishing to install a new line (henceforth referred to as Company A) to, after having reached {{an agreement with the}} pole's owner, must give every company already on the pole 30 days notice to move their equipment. If those companies do not comply after 30 days, then Company A can perform the complex <b>make-ready</b> work. If there are any errors or problems from Company A's <b>make-ready</b> work, then the companies already on the pole can recoup expenses from Company A.|$|E
5000|$|Some books, {{particularly}} those with shorter runs (i.e. fewer copies) will be printed on sheet-fed offset presses, but most books are now printed on web presses, which are fed by a continuous roll of paper, and can consequently print more copies in a shorter time. As {{the production line}} circulates, a complete [...] "book" [...] is collected together in one stack, next to another, and another A web press carries out the folding itself, delivering bundles of signatures (sections) ready {{to go into the}} gathering line. Note that the pages of a book are printed two at a time, not as one complete book. Excess numbers are printed to make up for any spoilage due to <b>make-readies</b> or test pages to assure final print quality.|$|R

50|$|The Last Planner System, as {{developed}} by the Lean Construction Institute, is: The collaborative, commitment-based planning system that integrates should-can-will-did planning (pull planning, <b>make-ready,</b> look-ahead planning) with constraint analysis, weekly work planning based upon reliable promises, and learning based upon analysis of PPC (plan percent complete) and reasons for variance.|$|E
5000|$|General Sir Cecil Frederick Nevil Macready, 1st Baronet, [...] (7 May 1862 - 9 January 1946), known affectionately as <b>Make-Ready</b> (close to {{the correct}} {{pronunciation}} of his name), was a British Army officer. He served in senior staff appointments in the First World War and was the last British military commander in Ireland, and also served for two years as Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis in London.|$|E
50|$|In a {{location}} which has adopted one touch <b>make-ready,</b> companies that own utility poles {{agree on one}} or more common contractors that could move existing attachments on a pole (‘make ready’ work), allowing a single crew to move all attachments on a pole on a single visit, rather than sending in a unique crew to move each attachment sequentially. Supporters of the measure argue this will significantly reduce the time, disruption, and cost to local communities caused by installing new lines.|$|E
50|$|Sheet-fed presses offer several advantages. Because {{individual}} {{sheets are}} fed through, {{a large number}} of sheet sizes and format sizes can be run through the same press. In addition, waste sheets can be used for <b>make-ready</b> (which is the testing process to ensure a quality print run). This allows for lower cost preparation so that good paper is not wasted while setting up the press, for plates and inks. Waste sheets do bring some disadvantages as often there are dust and offset powder particles that transfer on to the blankets and plate cylinders, creating imperfections on the printed sheet. This method produces the highest quality images.|$|E
5000|$|On February 11, 2016, the City Council of Louisville, Kentucky voted 23-0 {{to adopt}} a One Touch <b>Make-Ready</b> Statute, making it the first {{city in the country}} to adopt such legislation. According to city councilman Bill Hollander, who {{sponsored}} the legislation [...] "This will help businesses locate here and grow here. It will create jobs, and will retain and attract our young people and make Louisville broadband ready." [...] These sentiments were echoed by Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, who stated that it would help lay the groundwork for entities like Google Fiber, and said [...] "Tonight's vote puts Louisville one step closer toward becoming a Google Fiber city." [...] The legislation states that an applicant for attachment must first receive approval from the existing pole owners, at which point it may contract a pre-approved construction crew to perform all make ready work at its own expense. Pole owners and pre-existing providers whose wires were moved may choose to do post-make ready work inspections and call for remedial work if needed, at the new provider’s expense.|$|E
50|$|Rotary {{letterpress}} {{machines are}} still {{used on a}} wide scale for printing self-adhesive and non-self-adhesive labels, tube laminate, cup stock, etc. The printing quality achieved by a modern letterpress machine with UV curing is on par with flexo presses. It is more convenient and user friendly than a flexo press. It uses water-wash photopolymer plates, which {{are as good as}} any solvent-washed flexo plate. Today even CtP (computer-to-plate) plates are available making it a full-fledged, modern printing process. Because there is no anilox roller in the process, the <b>make-ready</b> time also goes down when compared to a flexo press. Inking is controlled by keys very much similar to an offset press. UV inks for letterpress are in paste form, unlike flexo. Various manufacturers produce UV rotary letterpress machines, viz. Dashen, Nickel, Taiyo Kikai, KoPack, Gallus, etc. - and offer hot/cold foil stamping, rotary die cutting, flatbed die cutting, sheeting, rotary screen printing, adhesive side printing, and inkjet numbering. Central impression presses are more popular than inline presses due to their ease of registration and simple design. Printing of up to nine colours plus varnish is possible with various online converting processes.|$|E
40|$|Regarding the {{backward}} {{rolling in}} the mat work the skilled and the unskilled were seen to differ in the following points; 1. Compared with their postures for <b>make-ready,</b> while {{the back of the}} skilled had a roundness, the unskilled had it stretched out. In the former, the angle between his trunk and his upper thighs and the angle between his upper thighs and lower thighs were nearly equal. In contrast, in the latter, the angle between his trunk and upper thighs was much larger than the angle between his upper and lower thighs. 2. Immediately after starting the movement entering into from the <b>make-ready</b> posture, little change was observed in the angles between his trunk and upper thighs and between his upper and lower thighs in the former, but a great change was recognizable in the latter. 3. The former set his rump down farther backward than the latter. 4. The former rotated with less fluctuations speed compared with the latter. 5. The former had greater values in the ratio of distances between each region of his body than the latter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new testing {{form was}} designed, {{in which the}} screens having gray scales and some solid blocks were included. The screens consist of gray scales from 0 to 100 % of dot {{coverage}}, and the solid blocks also have coverage scales from 0 to 100 %. Printing experiment was performed, and densities and dot coverage of specific places were measured and recorded. Based on the testing data, density or dot coverage undulation with printing impressions was indicated by curves. Furthermore analysis was taken. Dot gains in the same prints are not constant, which cause that saddle shape in prints. Some reasons from construction of press such as the gap of cylinder, swing of transferring roller and oscillation of oscillating rollers were brought out. Same values of ink presetting can not get the same printing quality in the ink zones which have the same graphic coverage. The traditional press has a long <b>make-ready</b> time in printing running, which can reduce the efficiency of press. Shaft-less technology of inking system is put forward to cut down the <b>make-ready</b> time and to decrease the power consumption. New algorithm research is necessary for ink zone presetting {{in order to get}} more precise ink feeding. Some research on the press construction is also important for the press having some inherent defects...|$|E
40|$|Those {{who study}} lean {{manufacturing}} know that waste comes in many forms. We must remind ourselves {{that anything that}} does not produce exactly what the customer values, when it is needed, is a wasteful operation. Makereadies, or press setups, are wasteful, {{at least in the}} eyes of our customers. Reducing press setup time is critical for improving customer value and making the printer more competitive on short-runs while increasing overall productivity. Even though <b>make-ready</b> time is built into an estimate, {{the bottom line is that}} it isn’t something a customer is delighted about paying for. Reducing makeready time, therefore, becomes a strategy that improves competitiveness in the marketplace...|$|E
40|$|There is no {{question}} that eviction is bad news for renters. Forced moves put individuals and families at risk in so many ways: They have a more difficult time being accepted as tenants elsewhere; they frequently are disconnected from social-support networks, health care providers, employment and schools; and the stress takes a psychological toll of its own. For property owners and managers, turnover means additional expense for legal procedures, recruitment of new tenants and apartment <b>make-ready.</b> But in the nonprofit, mission-oriented world, it's not just about money; it's also about addressing the underlying challenges that drive nonpayment of rent to begin with. The question is what (resident) services are most successful as well as cost efficient. This is the issue this study set out to explore...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem is}} to devise a system of {{pre-setting}} the ink keys of a sheet-fed offset press {{in order to save}} <b>make-ready</b> time. A preliminary experiment is run to establish and identify the correlation between the information obtained from visually scanning the plates and the ink key dial settings. The test involves a control group and a test group making press runs to see if pre-setting the ink keys can save time. The results show that such an idea is possible. The preliminary experiment establishes a positive correlation between the two variables and test group press-run times are significantly less than control group 2 ̆ 7 s times. The study indicates that further research involving ink key settings and ink distribution would be useful...|$|E

40|$|Healing and {{treatment}} for chronic wounds are big problems and they affect overall states and fate {{of patients who}} are immobile after heavy injuries in consequence of some diseases or because of penetrating wounds. Prevention {{and treatment}} flowing from profound knowledge of anatomy, skin physiology, pathology and patho-physiology of defects origins and of healing process is currently taking a big step forward in treatment for refractory wounds. The thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. The theoretical part deals with skin anatomy and physiology, pathology and patho-physiology of origins of defects, healing processes and proper treatments of wounds, especially chronic wounds such as "diabetic foot syndrome, venous and arterial ulcerations and decubital ulcers. Preventative measures against decubital ulcers are described. Documentation of refractory wounds, 3 phases of healing and continuum of healing are described in detail. Re-bandages, the local wound care, are the most significant factor of treatment. Re-bandages follow standard procedures, which involve <b>make-ready</b> of patients, preparations of wounds for re-bandages, preparations of instruments and <b>make-ready</b> of attending staff. Good re-bandage assistance is crucial. Modern treatment methods include various new types of wound cleanup (from the mechanical one, chemical one and autolysis to the enzymatic one, with the use of larva therapy, for example) as well as the usage of very effective "moist healing methods. Various contact - not adhesive bandages, foams, alginates, hydro gels, antiseptic bandages, dressings with active Carbon, hydrocolloids, hydro adherent dressings, hydro fibres, bandages with active AG ions, chitosin, dressings with hyaluronic acid, collagen bandages, dressings with iodine, mupirocin, or honey. The practical part is dedicated to qualitative research, in a way of non standardised interview. There were two thesis objectives: To map the usage of modern treatments for refractory wounds and to enlighten general nurses in this field. 15 nurses, who deal with chronic wounds, from various emergency wards and hospital wards took part in the interviews. Information was collected from February 2010 to April 2010 and it was elaborated into 15 casuistries. The result of analysed answers was digested into a table. In the Discussion I analysed the particular answers and set 3 hypotheses for each domain. Domain 1 : H 1 : Modern treatments for healing of wounds are not systematically used at most units. H 2 : Monolithic systems for usage and indication of modern methods do not exist at most units. H 3 : Statistics of chronic wounds existence is not kept at many units. Domain 2 : H 1 : Trainings are organised by medical facilities in collaboration with distributing companies but their capacities do not satisfy the interest of applicants. H 2 : Most nurses declare good knowledge of chronic wound healing phases and of continuum of healing. H 3 : Neither managers of medical facilities nor health insurance companies have sufficient knowledge regarding the "cost [...] benefit of chronic wound treatments. The Conclusion summarise the whole thesis. The importance of follow up treatment and rehabilitation for subsequent fate of afflicted patients and their families is underlined in this part...|$|E
