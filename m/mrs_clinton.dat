500|$|Clinton {{has often}} been {{described}} in the popular media as a polarizing figure, with some arguing otherwise. James Madison University political science professor Valerie Sulfaro's 2007 study used the American National Election Studies' [...] "feeling thermometer" [...] polls, which measure the degree of opinion about a political figure, to find that such polls during Clinton's first lady years confirm the [...] "conventional wisdom that Hillary Clinton is a polarizing figure", with the added insight that [...] "affect towards <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> as first lady tended to be very positive or very negative, with a fairly constant one fourth of respondents feeling ambivalent or neutral". University of California, San Diego political science professor Gary Jacobson's 2006study of partisan polarization found that in a state-by-state survey of job approval ratings of the state's senators, Clinton had the fourth-largest partisan difference of any senator, with a 50-percentage-point difference in approval between New York's Democrats and Republicans.|$|E
500|$|The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee {{issued its}} {{majority}} report on September 18, 1996, {{in which it}} accused the Clinton administration of having obstructed the committee's efforts to investigate the Travelgate scandal. [...] It portrayed Bill Clinton as being heavily involved in the travel office affair, {{more than any other}} investigation. [...] The report's chapter titles were lurid: [...] "The White House Stonewalled All Investigations into the White House Travel Office Firings and Related Matters", [...] "The White House Initiated a Full-Scale Campaign of Misinformation in the Aftermath of the Travel Office Firings and President Clinton Led the Misinformation Campaign from the First Days of the Travelgate Debacle", [...] "Foster's Death Shattered a White House Just Recovering from an Abysmal First 6 Months of Administration", and so forth. [...] Democratic members of the Committee walked out in protest over the report, with ranking member Henry Waxman calling it [...] "an embarrassment to you , this committee and this Congress" [...] and [...] "a crassly partisan smear campaign against President Clinton, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> and this administration." [...] The following month Clinger forwarded the report, along with one on Filegate, to the Independent Counsel, suggesting that the testimony of several witnesses be looked at for possible perjury or obstruction of justice. [...] Democrats said this was politically motivated in an attempt to influence the 1996presidential election.|$|E
2500|$|Palin and Clinton were {{compared}} and contrasted {{with one another}} in the media. A New York Times article explains, [...] "Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Palin have little in common beyond their breakout performances at the conventions and the soap opera aspects of their family lives. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> always faces high expectations; Ms. Palin faced low expectations this week, and benefited from them. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> can seem harsh when she goes on the attack; Ms. Palin has shown a knack for attacking without seeming nasty. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> has a lot of experience; Ms. Palin, not so much. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> is pantsuits; Ms. Palin is skirts." [...] Guy Cecil, the former political director of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said it was [...] "insulting" [...] for Republicans to compare Ms. Palin to Mrs. Clinton." [...] The Saturday Night Live skit [...] "A Nonpartisan Message from Governor Sarah Palin & Senator Hillary Clinton" [...] counterpoised Palin, played by Tina Fey, against Hillary Clinton, played by Amy Poehler. The skit pointed out their opposing political views and presented Palin as unversed in global politics, as emphasized by the line: [...] "I can see Russia from my house." [...] Ex-Hewlett-Packard chief executive and former McCain advisor Carly Fiorina blasted the Saturday Night Live sketch in a television interview: [...] "They were defining Hillary Clinton as very substantive and Sarah Palin as totally superficial," [...] and an ABC news blog headline soon after ran, [...] "Now the McCain Campaign's Complaining that Saturday Night Live Skit Was 'Sexist'." ...|$|E

It doesn't mention any specific procedure. It doesn’t even suggest the mandate should be eliminated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{nomination}} of Sarah Palin for the vice presidency at the Republican National Convention, Palin and Clinton were compared and contrasted {{with one another in}} the media, due to their status as women running in the 2008 presidential election. A New York Times article stated, [...] "Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Palin have little in common beyond their breakout performances at the conventions and the soap opera aspects of their family lives. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> always faces high expectations; Mrs. Palin faced low expectations this week, and benefited from them. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> can seem harsh when she goes on the attack; Mrs. Palin has shown a knack for attacking without seeming nasty. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> has a lot of experience; Ms. Palin, not so much. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> is pantsuits; Mrs. Palin is skirts."

A Saturday Night Live skit, [...] "A Nonpartisan Message From Governor Sarah Palin & Senator Hillary Clinton", counterposed Palin, played by Tina Fey, against Hillary Clinton, played by Amy Poehler. Fey presented Palin as a dimwit unable to understand global politics, as emphasized by the line: [...] "I can see Russia from my house." [...] Former Hewlett-Packard chief executive and McCain advisor Carly Fiorina blasted that one of the Saturday Night Live parodies of Sarah Palin in a television interview: [...] "They were defining Hillary Clinton as very substantive and Sarah Palin as totally superficial," [...] and an ABC News headline soon after ran, [...] "Now the McCain Campaign's Complaining that Saturday Night Live Skit Was 'Sexist'".

2500|$|Clinton {{has been}} criticized for not giving credit to a ghostwriter in {{connection}} with It Takes a Village. [...] The majority of the book was reportedly written by ghostwriter Barbara Feinman. When the book was first announced in April 1995, The New York Times reported publisher Simon & Schuster as saying [...] "The book will actually be written by Barbara Feinman, a journalism professor at Georgetown University in Washington. Ms. Feinman will conduct a series of interviews with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> who will help edit the resulting text." ...|$|E
2500|$|The book {{includes}} more than 50 letters written to the First Pets by children and more than 80 photographs of Socks and Buddy. [...] Examples of questions that letters asked include, [...] "Who do you like best? Mr. Clinton? <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> or Chelsea?" [...] and, [...] "How do you like being a dog, Buddy? I like being a person." [...] Socks was also {{asked if he was}} allowed to watch MTV and both pets were also asked if they ever got petted by the Spice Girls.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks {{released}} emails {{and documents}} from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) seemingly presenting ways to undercut Bernie Sanders and showing apparent favouritism towards Clinton, leading to the resignation of party chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The New York Times reported that [...] "Assange accused <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> of having been among those pushing to indict him..." [...] {{and that he had}} timed the release to coincide with the 2016 Democratic National Convention. In an interview with Robert Peston of ITV News Assange suggested that he saw Hillary Clinton as a personal foe.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to her operatic recordings, she has also sung the title role in the first complete recording of the score of Gershwin's Oh, Kay!. She has also recorded albums of songs by Vernon Duke and Rodgers and Hart. Upshaw was a guest of President of the United States Bill Clinton and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> on the NBC special, Christmas in Washington. [...] The BBC presented a prime-time telecast of her 1996 London Proms Concert, [...] "Dawn at Dusk", in which she performed songs from the American musical theater. Her engagements with James Levine over the years led to a 1997 recording of Debussy songs.|$|E
2500|$|Later, in a 2002 {{article for}} The Writer's Chronicle, Barbara Feinman Todd (now using her married name) related {{that the project}} with Clinton had gone smoothly, {{producing}} drafts in a round-robin style. Feinman agrees that Clinton was involved with the project, but also states that, [...] "Like any first lady, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> had an extremely hectic schedule and writing a book without assistance would have been logistically impossible." [...] Feinman reiterates that her only objection to the whole process {{was the lack of}} any acknowledgement. A 2005 Georgetown University web page bio for Barbara Feinman Todd states that It Takes a Village was one of [...] "several high-profile books" [...] that she has [...] "assisted, as editor, writer and researcher." [...] Feinman Todd wrote more about the collaboration in her 2017 memoir [...] "Pretend I'm Not Here".|$|E
2500|$|Both {{mechanisms}} contributed in {{the case}} of Hillary Clinton, who has been called, and has publicly called herself, [...] "Hillary". Peter Funt, of Candid Camera, wrote in a February 21, 2007 New York Times op-ed piece, [...] "The Mononym Platform": [...] "Someone has apparently decided that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> will be the first major single-name candidate since 1952, when Ike's P.R. gurus realized that 'Eisenhower' was tough to fit on a bumper sticker... In an apparent attempt to model her marketing on the likes of Madonna, Beyoncé and Cher, Mrs. Clinton's site proclaimed: [...] 'Today, Hillary took the first step...'..." [...] In an interview with Hillary Clinton published in Salon.com, the interviewer acknowledged receiving reader accusations of sexism whenever he referred to Clinton in print as [...] "Hillary" [...] (in contrast with male candidates who were almost always referred to by their last names), although he stated it was primarily to avoid confusion with her husband Bill Clinton.|$|E
2500|$|In late June 2016, it was {{reported}} that Bill Clinton met privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on her private plane on the tarmac at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Officials indicated that the 30 minute meeting took place when Clinton became aware that Lynch's plane was on the same tarmac at the airport. [...] When the meeting became public, Lynch stated that it was [...] "primarily social" [...] and [...] "there was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body". Lynch was criticized for her involvement in the meeting and was called on by some critics to recuse herself from involvement in the FBI's investigation of the email case. In response, she stated [...] "The F.B.I. is investigating whether <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> her aides or anyone else broke the law by setting up a private email server for her to use as secretary of state", but [...] "the case will be resolved by the same team that has been working on it from the beginning" [...] and [...] "I will be accepting their recommendations." ...|$|E
2500|$|McVeagh's {{first film}} {{appearance}} was {{a supporting role}} in the classic High Noon (1952) in which she played Mildred Fuller alongside Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly. [...] In the early 1950s she was under contract with Columbia Pictures. [...] During that time, she co-starred in Tight Spot as Clara Moran playing the sister of Ginger Rogers: Of her performance, The New York Times raved [...] "For our money, the best scene, whipped up by scenarist William Bowers, is the anything-but-tender reunion of Miss Rogers and her sister, Eve McVeagh ... an ugly, blistering pip." [...] Ms. McVeagh was also featured opposite Richard Widmark and Lauren Bacall in The Cobweb as Shirley Irwin. [...] She starred as Viv in The Glass Web, and was featured as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> in Three in the Attic, Mrs. Masters in The Way West, Mrs. Griggs in Crime & Punishment, USA, a reporter in the Dino De Laurentiis production of King Kong, and The Graduate. Her final co-starring film role was in the independent film Money to Burn (1983) as Vivian. [...] Her last onscreen appearance was a cameo role in Creator (1985) with Peter O'Toole. Ms. McVeagh's contributions to film were recognized by the bestowal of full voting membership in the actor's branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in September 1974. Her contributions in film spanned 33 years.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> looked helplessly at her friend; {{she feared}} {{something}} was wrong, and she didn't {{know what to}} do. But the neighbour, with a significant look, pointed to the Daily Telegraph, which was lying on a chair. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> brightened up {{and took it to}} her husband.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> was disgusted to see {{her husband}} enter a public-house.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{began to}} cry, {{and the doctor}} looked at her compassionately.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> embraced Rupert in silence, {{she was too}} {{affected}} for speech.|$|E
60|$|The Clintons {{lived in}} the fifth house down in the Adonis Road, {{and the house was}} {{distinguishable}} from its fellows by the yellow curtains with which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> had furnished all the windows. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> was a woman of taste. Before marriage, the happy pair, accompanied by Mrs Clinton's mother, had gone house-hunting, and fixed on the Adonis Road, which was cheap, respectable and near the station. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> would dearly have liked a house on the right-hand side of the road, which had nooks and angles and curiously-shaped windows. But Mr Clinton was firm in his refusal, and his mother-in-law backed him up.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{looked at}} him; {{he was quite}} calm, and smilingly {{returned}} her glance.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In my bed!' screamed <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton.</b> 'Not if I know it! 'Ere, you,' she said, {{addressing}} the man, and pushing past her husband. 'Out you get! I'm {{not going to}} 'ave tramps and loafers in my 'ouse. Get out!' <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> was an energetic woman, and a strong one. Catching hold of her husband's stick, and flourishing it, she opened the front door.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{heaved a}} deep sigh. 'And {{what do you}} think 'ad better be done now?' she asked.|$|E
60|$|A {{month later}} a small party were {{assembled}} in Captain Clinton's bungalow. Mrs. Humphreys {{was standing with}} a baby in each arm. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> was lying upon a sofa crying bitterly. Captain Clinton was {{walking up and down}} the room, hot and angry. The surgeon of the regiment was standing grave and sympathetic by <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Sergeant Humphreys was in the attitude of attention by the door, with an anxious troubled expression on his face.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> shrugged her shoulders. 'Why couldn't {{they go to}} the workhouse, I wonder? I've no {{patience}} with people like that.' ...|$|E
60|$|One day <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{was talking}} to a {{neighbour}} in the bedroom, the patient was so quiet that they thought him asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you don't}} mind, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton,</b> I {{should like to}} talk to your doctor alone about the case. You can wait in the next room.' ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> who was {{but just}} {{recovering}} from her illness, was too prostrated by this terrible blow {{to be able}} to offer any suggestion.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, dear! oh, dear!' sobbed <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton,</b> who {{had looked}} up and listened with astonishment to her husband's speech. 'Oh, dear! oh, dear! what is he talking about?' ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{too serious}} {{a matter for}} <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> to waste any words on; she ran upstairs, put on her bonnet, and quickly walked to her friend, the doctor.|$|E
60|$|Mr Clinton, as before, {{had gone}} out, but <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{did her best}} to {{entertain}} the two doctors. The specialist, who talked most incessantly himself, was extremely impatient of other people's conversation.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{straightway}} went to Mr Evans's rooms, {{explained to}} him the case, and settled that {{on the following day}} he should come and see what he could do with her husband.|$|E
60|$|The morning came at {{last and}} found him feverish and parched, unable to move. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> sent for the doctor, a slow, {{cautious}} Scotchman, in whose wisdom <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> implicitly relied, since he always agreed with her own idea of her children's ailments. This prudent gentleman ventured to assert that Mr Clinton had caught cold and had something wrong with his lungs. Then, promising to send medicine and come again next day, went off on his rounds. Mr Clinton grew worse; he became delirious. When his wife, smoothing his pillow, {{asked him how he}} felt, he looked at her with glassy eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> was not {{henceforth}} on {{the very}} best of terms with her husband, but he always treated her with his accustomed gentleness, though he insisted on spending his nights on the dining-room sofa.|$|E
6000|$|Tea {{was brought}} in, and they drank it, talking of parish matters, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> discreetly trying to pump the curate. Was it really true that Mrs Palmer of No. 17 Adonis Road drank so terribly? ...|$|E
60|$|Next day <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{called on}} the doctor, and told him of her husband's strange behaviour. The doctor slowly and meditatively nodded, then he raised his eyebrows, and with his finger {{significantly}} tapped his head....|$|E
