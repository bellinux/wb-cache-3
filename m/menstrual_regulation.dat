40|$|Puberty is {{characterized}} by a progressive maturation of the hypothalamus-pituitary gonadal axis which, in girls results in menarche. The first menstrual cycles are usually irregular and anovulatory, and the subtle positive and negative regulation of sex steroids on the hypothalamus-pituitary axis has probably not reached adult maturity. An investigation has been carried out in 99 normal adolescent girls, divided into 3 groups: 1 - 2, 3 - 4 and 5 years after menarche, by measuring basal hormonal values as well as the responses to LHRH and TRH during the follicular and luteal phases. Basal FSH and LH values reached adult levels after the second year of menarche, while FSH and LH responses to 50 microgram LHRH showed a regular and progressive increase from 1 to 5 years post-menarche, resulting, in the 5 -year group and in spite of the half dose received, in definitely higher FSH and LH responses than those observed in the adult women after 100 microgram LHRH. This enhanced pituitary responsiveness to LHRH is due to still progressively increasing estradiol and progesterone secretions, the latter hormone remaining still lower than in the adults. Basal prolactin levels were significantly higher than those found in adult women with a slightly increased prolactin response to TRH and an exaggerated one of TSH, with normal T 3 and T 4 levels. These data show that from the onset of menarche to the complex and subtle adult <b>menstrual</b> cycle <b>regulation,</b> there is a continuing maturation of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis of the gonads which lasts approximately 5 years. It {{is characterized}} by increasing E 2 secretion, low progesterone secretion and slightly increased prolactin levels, with a frequently impaired luteal phase. The enhanced pituitary sensitivity to releasing hormones is due to the positive feedback mechanism of E 2 which is not yet associated with adequate progesterone secretion for a negative feedback, as in adult women. Thus, adolescence is still a maturation period, the onset of ovulation being the final step in this development...|$|R

Different cell types were harvested from the two major regions of the endometrium during midsecretory phases (Days 21 – 23) of adequate artificial menstrual cycles: glandular epithelia (G) or stroma (S) from the functionalis (F) or the basalis (B). Amplification of the cDNA populations (primer-specific adaptors) was used {{to increase the amount}} of nucleic acid for further analysis. This single amplification step allowed us to detect the housekeeping genes (glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase and 18 S rRNA) and the cDNA smears in the samples. Using differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (DDRT-PCR), six fragments were selected, cloned, and sequenced based on their regional and cell type localization. Primer-specific PCR analysis subsequently confirmed the localization of three fragments: F 1, highly expressed in the functionalis but not the basalis, was homologous (93 % identical) to the human leukotriene B 4 receptor BLT 2; FS- 1, highly expressed only in the stroma of the functionalis, had a 94 % homology with an as yet uncharacterized gene (FLJ 124360); and BG- 1, primarily expressed only in the glandular epithelia of the basalis, showed a 98 % homology with an uncharacterized bacterial artificial chromosome clone sequence.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Here we {{describe}} the consensus guideline methodology, summarise the evidence-based recommendations we provided to the World Health Organisation (WHO) for their consideration {{in the development of}} global guidance and present a narrative review on the management of anovulatory infertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aim of this paper was to present an evidence base for the management of anovulatory PCOS. SEARCH METHODS: The evidence to support providing recommendations involved a collaborative process for: (i) identification of priority questions and critical outcomes, (ii) retrieval of up-to-date evidence and exiting guidelines, (iii) assessment and synthesis of the evidence and (iv) the formulation of draft recommendations to be used for reaching consensus {{with a wide range of}} global stakeholders. For each draft recommendation, the methodologist evaluated the quality of the supporting evidence that was then graded as very low, low, moderate or high for consideration during consensus. OUTCOMES: Evidence was synthesized and we made recommendations across the definition of PCOS including hyperandrogenism, <b>menstrual</b> cycle <b>regulation</b> and ovarian assessment. Metabolic features and the impact of ethnicity were covered. Management includes lifestyle changes, bariatric surgery, pharmacotherapy (including clomiphene citrate (CC), aromatase inhibitors, metformin and gonadotropins), as well as laparoscopic surgery. In-vitro fertilization (IVF) was considered as were the risks of ovulation induction and of pregnancy in PCOS. Approximately 80 % of women who suffer from anovulatory infertility have PCOS. Lifestyle intervention is recommended first in women who are obese largely on the basis of general health benefits. Bariatric surgery can be considered where the body mass index (BMI) is ≥ 35 kg/m 2 and lifestyle therapy has failed. Carefully conducted and monitored pharmacological ovulation induction can achieve good cumulative pregnancy rates and multiple pregnancy rates can be minimized with adherence to recommended protocols. CC should be first-line pharmacotherapy for ovulation induction and letrozole can also be used as first-line therapy. Metformin alone has limited benefits in improving live birth rates. Gonadotropins and laparoscopic surgery can be used as second-line treatment. There is no clear evidence for efficacy of acupuncture or herbal mixtures in women with PCOS. For women with PCOS who fail lifestyle and ovulation induction therapy or have additional infertility factors, IVF can be used with the safer gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol. If a GnRH-agonist protocol is used, metformin as an adjunct may reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Patients should be informed of the potential side effects of ovulation induction agents and of IVF on the foetus, and of the risks of multiple pregnancy. Increased risks for the mother during pregnancy and for the child, including the exacerbating impact of obesity on adverse outcomes, should also be discussed. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: This guidance generation and evidence-synthesis analysis has been conducted in a manner to be considered for global applicability for the safe administration of ovulation induction for anovulatory women with PCOS.

40|$|Objetivos: avaliar a eficácia do acetato de medroxiprogesterona e do acetato de {{megestrol}} nas hiperplasias de endométrio. Métodos: foram incluídas, retrospectivamente 47 pacientes com sangramento uterino anormal, submetidas a curetagem uterina diagnóstica e/ou biópsia de endométrio, cujo achado histopatológico foi de hiperplasia de endométrio. Nas pacientes com hiperplasia sem atipia foi iniciado a terapêutica com acetato de medroxiprogesterona por via oral, na dose de 10 mg/dia durante 10 - 12 dias por mês. Nas com atipia, era utilizado o acetato de megestrol por via oral, dose de 160 mg/dia, uso contínuo. O período de tratamento variou de 3 a 18 meses. Biópsia de endométrio e/ou curetagem uterina de controle foram realizadas entre três e seis meses do início do tratamento e periodicamente para avaliar a resposta terapêutica. Resultados: foram analisadas 42 pacientes com hiperplasia endometrial sem atipia e cinco com atipia. A média de idade das pacientes foi de 49, 5 ± 10, 6 anos, sendo 70, 2 % com idade superior a 45 anos. O acetato de medroxiprogesterona foi eficaz em fazer regredir as hiperplasias sem atipias em 83, 2 % (35 / 42) e o acetato de megestrol em 80 % (4 / 5) das hiperplasias com atipia. Em 16, 8 % (7 casos) das hiperplasias sem atipia e em 20 % (1 caso) das com atipia, ocorreu persistência das lesões, apesar do tratamento. Em nenhum caso ocorreu progressão para câncer de endométrio, durante o período de seguimento que foi de 3 meses a 9 anos. No acompanhamento dessas pacientes, verificamos que 18 (38, 3 %) apresentaram amenorréia, em 12 (25, 5 %) ocorreu regularização do ciclo menstrual e 17 (36, 2 %) permaneceram com sangramento uterino anormal, sendo submetidas a histerectomia total abdominal. O exame anatomopatológico mostrou a persistência da lesão hiperplásica em oito casos, leiomioma em quatro, adenomiose em três, mio-hipertrofia uterina difusa em um caso e útero normal em outro, tendo havido regressão das lesões hiperplásicas nesses últimos nove casos. Conclusões: o tratamento das hiperplasias de endométrio com acetato de medroxiprogesterona e/ou acetato de megestrol, representa uma alternativa satisfatória para mulheres que desejam preservar o útero ou que tenham risco cirúrgico elevado. Entretanto, é necessário monitorização cuidadosa do endométrio, o que deve ser realizado pela avaliação dos sintomas, ultra-sonografia transvaginal e biópsia periódica. Purpose: {{to evaluate}} the efficacy of medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate in endometrial hyperplasia. Patients and Methods: forty-seven patients with abnormal uterine bleeding were retrospectively evaluated. These patients were submitted to diagnostic uterine curettage and/or endometrial biopsy, with histopathological finding of endometrial hyperplasia. Patients with hyperplasia without atypia received 10 mg/day oral medroxyprogesterone acetate during 10 to 12 days a month. Those with hyperplasia with atypia received 160 mg/day oral megestrol acetate continuously. The length of treatment ranged from 3 to 18 months. Control endometrial biopsy and/or uterine curettage were performed 3 and 6 months {{from the beginning of}} treatment, and then periodically to evaluate whether or not regression of hyperplasia occurred. Results: forty-two patients with endometrial hyperplasia without atypia and 5 with hyperplasia with atypia were included. The mean age of the patients was 49. 5 ± 10. 6 years (22 to 72 years), 70. 2 % aged over 45 years. Medroxy-progesterone acetate was effective in promoting regression of 83. 2 % (35 / 42) of hyperplasia without atypia, and megestrol acetate in 80 % (4 / 5) of hyperplasia with atypia. Despite treatment, lesions persisted in 16. 8 % (7 cases) of hyperplasia with atypia and in 20 % (1 case) of hyperplasia without atypia. No progression to endometrial cancer was seen during the follow-up period of 3 months to 9 years. During follow-up, we found that 18 patients (38. 3 %) showed amenorrhea, 12 (25. 5 %) <b>menstrual</b> cycle <b>regulation,</b> and 17 (36. 2 %) persistent abnormal uterine bleeding and underwent total abdominal hysterectomy. Histological examination of the uterus showed 8 patients with persistence of hyperplastic lesion, 4 with leiomyoma, 3 with adenomyosis, 1 with diffuse uterine myohypertrophy, and 1 with normal uterus, despite regression of the hyperplastic lesions in 9 of the 17 patients. Conclusions: the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia with medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate can be a safe alternative for women who refuse to have their uterus removed or those at high risk for surgery. However, a careful monitoring of the endometrium is needed. This can be achieved with periodical endometrial biopsy, transvaginal ultrasonography, and evaluation of the symptoms...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: Annually, {{more than}} 700, 000 women turn to <b>menstrual</b> <b>regulation,</b> or uterine {{evacuation}} with vacuum aspiration; many more resort to unsafe abortion. Using pills for {{the evacuation of}} the uterus could increase women’s access to safe <b>menstrual</b> <b>regulation</b> services and reduce {{the high levels of}} abortion- and menstrual regulation– related morbidity in Bangladesh. METHODS: At 10 facilities in Bangladesh, 651 consenting women who were seeking <b>menstrual</b> <b>regulation</b> services and who were 63 days or less past their last menstrual period received 200 mg of mifepristone followed 24 hours later by 800 mcg of buccal misoprostol, administered either at home or in the clinic. Prospective data were collected to determine women’s experience and satisfaction with the procedure, <b>menstrual</b> <b>regulation</b> outcome, and the human and physical resources required for providing the method. Focus group discussions were conducted with a purposively sampled group of service providers at each site to understand their attitudes about the introduction of <b>menstrual</b> <b>regulation</b> with medication.

While many health professionals consider women's explanations of <b>menstrual</b> <b>regulation</b> as a "cover-up" for self-induced abortions, such popular justifications may represent either an unconscious or artful manipulation of hegemonic, anti-abortion ideology expressed in prudent, unobtrusive and veiled ways.

The program emphasizes individual counseling which stresses informed choice in reproductive health care. The evaluation examines the cost of this process as a function of behavioral outcomes which include the percentage of clients who are post-MR contraceptive acceptors and the percentage which return for follow-up care and consultation 2 weeks after the procedure. The average cost per post MR contracepting client is $ 3. 75; the average cost per returning client is $ 5. 68, figures which appear to be well within the range of costs reported by family planning programs in developing countries. <b>menstrual</b> <b>regulation</b> cost-effectiveness evaluation Bangladesh family planning...|$|E
