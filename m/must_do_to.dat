5|$|Realizing {{they must}} make Alex a Dragonmaster to confront Ghaleon and save Luna, the team {{heads to the}} border town of Nanza to enlist Kyle, Jessica's boyfriend, in letting them cross into foreign land. After {{traveling}} to a town of inventors, the group obtains a floating device that leads them to the lair of the Red Dragon, who is seemingly destroyed by Ghaleon just before they arrive. The dragon's spirit grants Alex her power before disappearing, and the group departs for the Blue Dragon's cave behind a musical town. Again, the dragon is defeated before their arrival, and the team must travel to the distant and barren Frontier to seek the final trial. The party finds the black dragon, which attacks the team in a mad rage induced by Ghaleon but is defeated. With the final dragon's blessing, Alex and his companions approach the construction site of Ghaleon's mobile mechanical castle, the Grindery, but are unable to stop its advance before it destroys Vane using the power of Luna, who is revealed to be the human form of the Goddess Althena and who is under the Magic Emperor's control. After obtaining Althena's Sword and learning the truth about Luna, the party attacks the Grindery and defeats both Xenobia and the Magic Emperor. Knowing what he <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> bring Luna back, Alex climbs the path to Luna, who, as Althena, continuously blasts him with lightning; he plays his harp as he advances, and hearing their song allows Luna's personality to return. She awakens in Alex's arms, surrounded by their friends.|$|E

2500|$|However, the Court has {{identified}} a constitutional difficulty with many modern vagrancy laws. In Papachristou v.

[...] In Brown v. Texas, , the Court struck down Texas's stop-and-identify law as violating the Fourth Amendment because it allowed police officers to stop individuals without [...] "specific, objective facts establishing reasonable suspicion to believe the suspect was involved in criminal activity." [...] And in Kolender v. Lawson, , the Court struck down a California stop-and-identify law that required a suspect to provide [...] "credible and reliable identification" [...] upon request.

2500|$|Despite {{its many}} {{institutional}} forms, the function {{and structure of}} ideology is unchanging and present throughout history; as Althusser states, [...] "ideology has no history". All ideologies constitute a subject, even though {{he or she may}} differ according to each particular ideology. Memorably, Althusser illustrates this with the concept of [...] "hailing" [...] or [...] "interpellation". Drawing heavily from Jacques Lacan and his concept of the Mirror Stage, he compares ideology to a policeman shouting [...] "Hey you there!" [...] toward a person walking on the street. Upon hearing this call, the person responds by turning around and in doing so, is transformed into a subject. The person is conscious of being a subject and aware of the other person. Thus, for Althusser, being aware of other people is a form of ideology. Within that, Althusser sees subjectivity as a type of ideology. The person being hailed recognizes himself or herself as the subject of the hail, and knows to respond. Althusser calls this recognition a [...] "mis-recognition" [...] (méconnaissance), because it works retroactively: a material individual is always already an ideological subject, even before he or she is born. The [...] "transformation" [...] of an individual into a subject has always already happened; Althusser here acknowledges a debt to Spinoza's theory of immanence. To highlight this, Althusser offers the example of Christian religious ideology, embodied in the Voice of God, instructing a person on what his place in the world is and what he <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> be reconciled with Christ. From this, Althusser draws the point that in order for that person to identify as a Christian, he must first already be a subject; that is, by responding to God's call and following His rules, he affirms himself as a free agent, the author of the acts for which he assumes responsibility. We cannot recognize ourselves outside ideology, and in fact, our very actions reach out to this overarching structure. For Althusser, we acquire our identities by seeing ourselves mirrored in ideologies.|$|E
