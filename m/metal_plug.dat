As such, a molten core is reflective of the normal and safe state of operation of this reactor type. In the event the core overheats, a <b>metal</b> <b>plug</b> will melt, and the molten salt core will drain into tanks where it will cool in a non-critical configuration. Since the core is liquid, and already melted, it cannot be damaged.|$|E

According to Colonel Benjamin Huger of the Ordnance Department, Burton was studying the [...] "tige" [...] and Minié principles (the [...] "tige" [...] bullet had a steel stem designed to expand the bullet into the weapon's rifling). Burton designed a barrel which used a hard <b>metal</b> <b>plug</b> to expand the bullet into the rifling, and developed a hollow-base bullet design that worked even better. In 1855, Burton's modified design for the Minié bullet was adopted by the United States Army.|$|E

40|$|A {{literature}} survey of helium 2 liquid vapor phase separation is presented. Currently, {{two types of}} He 2 phase separators are being investigated: porous, sintered <b>metal</b> <b>plugs</b> and the active phase separator. The permeability K(P) shows consistency in porous plug geometric characterization. Both the heat and mass fluxes increase with K(P). Downstream pressure regulation to adjust for varying heat loads and both temperatures is possible. For large dynamic heat loads, the active phase separator shows a maximum heat rejection rate of up to 2 W and bath temperature stability of 0. 1 mK. Porous plug phase separation performance should be investigated for application to SIRTF and, in particular, that plugs of from 10 to the minus ninth square centimeters to 10 to the minus eighth square centimeters in conjunction with downstream pressure regulation be studied...|$|R

[...] The model used individually cast 10 ft x 10 ft (approximate) concrete panels, contoured with the land shape and river bed, including tributaries, cliffs, lakes, flood plains, bridges, and levees. <b>Metal</b> <b>plugs</b> or divots in the river bed provided [...] "roughness" [...] to simulate different types of material, whilst folded metal mesh simulated dense foliage.

50|$|To ensure this {{rotation}} {{had completed}} and the latches {{were in the}} proper position, the DC-10 cargo door also included a separate locking mechanism. The locks consisting of small pins that were slid horizontally through holes {{on the back of}} the latches, between the latch and the frame of the aircraft. When the pins were in place, they mechanically prevented movement back into the open position, so even the actuator motor could no longer open them. If the latches were not in their correct positions, the pins could not enter the holes, and the operating handle on the outside of the door would remain open and visually indicate that there was a problem. Additionally, the handle moved a <b>metal</b> <b>plug</b> into a vent cut in the outer door panel; if the vent was not plugged the door would not retain pressure, eliminating any force on the door. Lastly, there was an indicator light in the cockpit that would remain on if the door was not correctly latched.|$|E
50|$|To ensure this {{rotation}} {{was complete}} and the latches {{were in the}} proper position, the DC-10 cargo hatch design included a separate locking mechanism that consisted of small locking pins that slid behind flanges on the lock torque tube (which transferred the actuator force to the latch hooks through a linkage). When the locking pins were in place, any rotation of the latches would cause the torque tube flanges to contact the locking pins, making further rotation impossible. The pins were pushed into place by an operating handle {{on the outside of}} the hatch. If the latches were not properly closed, the pins would strike the torque tube flanges and the handle would remain open, visually indicating a problem. Additionally, the handle moved a <b>metal</b> <b>plug</b> into a vent cut in the outer hatch panel. If the vent was not plugged, the fuselage would not retain pressure, eliminating any pneumatic force on the hatch. Also, there was an indicator light in the cockpit, controlled by a switch actuated by the locking pin mechanism, that remained lit unless the cargo hatch was correctly latched.|$|E

There are also subtle differences between the crankshaft, and visible difference in the pattern of the SFi airbox.|$|R
5000|$|Core plugs {{can often}} {{be a source of}} leaks due to {{corrosion}} caused by cooling system water. Although modern antifreeze chemicals do not evaporate and may be considered [...] "permanent", anti-corrosion additives gradually deplete and must be replenished. Failure to do this periodic maintenance accelerates corrosion of engine parts, and the thin <b>metal</b> core <b>plugs</b> are often the first components to start leaking.|$|R
40|$|A design {{modification}} and a {{fabrication process}} that implements the modification have been conceived to solve two problems {{encountered in the}} development of back-illuminated, back-sidethinned complementary metal oxide/ semiconductor (CMOS) image-detector integrated circuits. The two problems are (1) how to form metal electrical-contact pads on the back side that are electrically connected through the thickness in proper alignment with electrical contact points on the front side and (2) how to provide alignment keys on the back side to ensure proper registration of backside optical components (e. g., microlenses and/or color filters) with the front-side pixel pattern. The essence of the design modification is to add <b>metal</b> <b>plugs</b> that extend from the desired front-side locations through the thickness and protrude from {{the back side of the}} substrate. The plugs afford the required front-to-back electrical conduction, and the protrusions of the plugs serve as both the alignment keys and the bases upon which the back-side electrical-contact pads can be formed...|$|R
40|$|The {{overreaching}} goal of {{this thesis}} research is to analyze liquid <b>metal</b> <b>plug</b> actuation in microfluidic channels and to exemplify this actuation in a tunable inductor design using liquid metal as a switching material, and to demonstrate the feasibility of liquid metal in other devices. A gallium and indium based alloy, EGaIn, which is liquid at room temperature is the liquid metal type chosen for this research. Although it owns some advantages such as high vapor pressure, non-toxicity and good conductivity, there are some crucial factors that we should pay attention to move the liquid metal in microchannels {{as a result of}} oxidation with contact to air and stickiness of oxidized skin to any surface. One of them is to determine the right coating material for coating the channel and the best surfactant to carry the liquid <b>metal</b> <b>plug</b> without leaving residues with sufficient amount of pressure. So far, liquid metals have been used in some RF applications, but EGaIn could not be implemented properly in a microfluidic channel as a separate liquid <b>metal</b> <b>plug</b> because of the oxidation issue. Our aim is here to verify that there are ways to handle the actuation of based liquid metals in microchannels. In this thesis, we have used EGaIn in the experiments conducted, but the acquired results are also applicable to galinstan, which is another gallium based alloy. Right after the liquid metal actuation is exhibited in microfluidic channels, this actuation is exemplified in tunable loop and spiral inductors on both PCB and glass slides using lithography technique. A closed loop channel with peristaltic pumping valves has been designed with the help of LabVIEWTM and proper channel designing technique. Therefore, moving the liquid metal in a desired way with an expected speed is achieved. At the end of the study, tunability in an RF inductor using liquid metal as a switching part is provided, once a solution to the nagging oxidation problem of liquid metals is offered, and thus the feasibility of liquid metals to the electrical device applications is demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Data {{previously}} reported for orifice induced pressure errors are {{extended to the}} case of higher Reynolds number flows, and a remedy is presented {{in the form of a}} porous <b>metal</b> <b>plug</b> for the orifice. Test orifices with apertures 0. 330, 0. 660, and 1. 321 cm in diam. were fabricated on a flat plate for trials in the NASA Langley wind tunnel at Mach numbers 0. 40 - 0. 72. A boundary layer survey rake was also mounted on the flat plate to allow measurement of the total boundary layer pressures at the orifices. At the high Reynolds number flows studied, the orifice induced pressure error was found to be a function of the ratio of the orifice diameter to the boundary layer thickness. The error was effectively eliminated by the insertion of a porous metal disc set flush with the orifice outside surface...|$|E

A NACA airfoil was tested at Mach numbers from 0. 60 to 0. 80 and at Reynolds numbers from 6 x 1, 000, 000 to 40 x 1, 000, 000. Data are included which compare pressure measurements obtained from porous plug orifices and from conventional orifices with diameters of 0. 025 cm (0. 010 in.) and 0. 102 cm (0. 040 in.). The two dimensional airfoil code GRUMFOIL was used to calculate boundary layer displacement thickness. The response time and the downstream effect of the porous plug orifice were considered in this investigation. The results showed that the porous plug orifice could be a viable method of reducing pressure error. The data also showed that the pressure measurements obtained with a 0. 102 -cm-diameter orifice were very close to the measurements obtained with 0. 025 -cm-diameter orifice over such of the airfoil and that downstream of a shock the orifice size was not critical...|$|E

40|$|A general {{review is}} given of {{containment}} technology for water-cooled nuclear reactors, including {{discussion of the}} methods of analysis of the pressure response of the containment to a loss-of-coolant accident. Particular {{attention is paid to}} considerations of heat transfer from the consequent reactor efflux in the situation of full-pressure containments, and various schemes given in the literature and used in computer codes for calculating condensation heat transfer are critically examined. An experimental study has been made in conditions typical of the postulated reactor accident situation using a rig consisting of a O 0. 014 m high pressure vessel which could discharge its contents through a defined flow path into a 2 m 3 steel containment vessel. The rig is instrumented to measure the instantaneous pressure and temperature distribution during a pressure vessel blowdown. It includes a system for measuring the condensation heat transfer coefficient transient in which the transient heat flux and surface temperature at a <b>metal</b> <b>plug</b> are derived from a single measurement of temperature within the plug by use of a Fourier Transform method. A simple point model analysis of the thermohydraulic conditions throughout the blowdown/ containment rig is derived and used to demonstrate the effect on prediction of containment pressure response of various heat transfer schemes and the relationship to the measured response. A new heat transfer scheme is found, based on the measured heat transfer transients which, when used in the derived code, gives reasonable fit to the measured pressure transients over a wide range of initial conditions...|$|E
40|$|Interposers for SiP {{will become}} more and more {{important}} for advanced electronic systems. But through substrate vias are essential for the 3 -D integration. Being a standard for laminate based materials this is much more complex for Si-wafers: High speed etching has to be combined with complex electrical isolation, diffusion barriers and void-free Cu-filling. Without doubt this can be solved in lab-scale but for high production scale cost is a tremendous barrier. Glass wafers with W-plugs have been intensively investigated in this paper. A new acronym has been posted to high-light this technology: TGV for Through Glass Vias. The results of modeling and simulation of TGV at RF/Microwave frequencies showed a very good compromise between wafer thickness, TGV-shape and via diameter for vertical <b>metal</b> <b>plugs</b> with 100 m diameters in 500 m thick glass wafer still very stable for thin film wafer processing without costly temporary wafer bonding processes.

50|$|The metal traces {{shown in}} the figure for {{conducting}} electric current into the thermal bump {{may or may not}} be directly connected to the circuitry of the chip. In the case where there are electrical connections to the chip circuitry, on-board temperature sensors and driver circuitry can be used to control the thermal bump in a closed loop fashion to maintain optimal performance. Second, the heat that is pumped by the thermal bump and the additional heat created by the thermal bump in the course of pumping that heat will need to be rejected into the substrate or board. Since the performance of the thermal bump can be improved by providing a good thermal path for the rejected heat, it is beneficial to provide high thermally conductive pathways on the backside of the thermal bump. The substrate could be a highly conductive ceramic substrate like AlN or a metal (e.g., Cu, CuW, CuMo, etc.) with a dielectric. In this case, the high thermal conductance of the substrate will act as a natural pathway for the rejected heat. The substrate might also be a multilayer substrate like a printed wiring board (PWB) designed to provide a high-density interconnect. In this case, the thermal conductivity of the PWB may be relatively poor, so adding thermal vias (e.g. <b>metal</b> <b>plugs)</b> can provide excellent pathways for the rejected heat.|$|R

In addition, the process used to form the contacts is challenging because of the relatively high attack rate of Ge in aqueous solutions. In this paper an alternative way of building and contacting a Ge diode is presented: leveraging the presence of the Si substrate, highly doped n- and p-type Si regions are formed {{on the sides of the}} Ge region replacing metal contacts.
