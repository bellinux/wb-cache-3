50|$|The {{great egret}} {{is a large}} heron with all-white plumage. Standing up to 1 m tall, this species can measure 80 to 104 cm in length and have a {{wingspan}} of 131 to 170 cm. Body mass can range from 700 to 1500 g, {{with an average of}} around 1000 g. It is thus only slightly smaller than the great blue or grey heron (A. cinerea). Apart from size, the great egret can be distinguished from other white egrets by its yellow bill and black legs and feet, though the bill may become darker and the lower legs lighter in the breeding season. In breeding plumage, delicate ornamental feathers are borne on the back. Males and females are identical in appearance; juveniles look like non-breeding adults. Differentiated from the intermediate egret (<b>Mesophoyx</b> <b>intermedius)</b> by the gape, which extends well beyond the back of the eye in case of the great egret, but ends just behind the eye in case of the intermediate egret.|$|E
