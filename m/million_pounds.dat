5|$|The three {{ships were}} the Italian 8,500-ton {{merchant}} vessel Duchessa d'Aosta, the second a large German tug Likomba, the third a diesel-powered barge Bibundi. Duchessa d'Aosta had a working radio which {{was considered a}} threat, {{with the potential to}} provide details of Allied naval movements.

The first page of the ship's cargo manifest, was not presented to the port authorities and the ship's captain refused to provide them with any details, which led to speculation it was also carrying arms or ammunition. In his visits to the island, SOE agent Leonard Guise kept the ships under observation, and in August 1941 submitted a plan to seize Likomba and disable Duchessa d'Aosta.

5|$|A {{few months}} later, United Diamond Fields of British Guiana was {{incorporated}} as a limited company. The company used Oppenheimer {{as a technical}} adviser, and immediately arranged to have its diamonds sold to the syndicate. The price was to be fixed for six months, with an auditor's certificate {{at the end of}} that time used to negotiate a new price. Oppenheimer was the only one with access to the accounting information, and the rest of the company had no way of checking that his figures were correct. In the same time frame, a new deposit of diamonds was discovered in South Africa, forcing the syndicate to acquire several <b>million</b> <b>pounds</b> worth of these new diamonds to prevent their control over the market being destroyed. This strained their finances and the new diamonds forced the price down.|$|E
