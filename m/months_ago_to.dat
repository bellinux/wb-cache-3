Later, she seduces him in Fatboy's van but throws him out in his underwear, humiliating him. She says goodbye to Shirley and leaves Walford for France in the van.|$|E
500|$|In 1888 Henson {{was ordained}} priest. Shortly {{afterwards}} All Souls appointed him vicar {{of a church}} in its gift: St Margaret's, Barking, in east London, a large, working class parish, {{with a population of}} 12,000, and increasing. At twenty-five he was the youngest vicar in the country, and had a large staff of curates to manage. An All Souls colleague Cosmo Lang, himself {{on the brink of a}} Church career, visited Henson at Barking and noted, [...] "He came six <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> a parish dead– 250 a good congregation in the church; and now, when he preaches, every seat is filled– 1100!" ...|$|E
500|$|Alistair reappears on {{the train}} {{at the same point}} in time as his {{previous}} travel, again having drained the people aboard it, and alters his behavior to avoid another encounter with the Fringe team. However, when they are brought to investigate this time, they have a feeling of déjà vu and find other evidence that points to Alistair, and determine that he is trying to go back in his personal time line several <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> prevent the death of his fiancée in a car collision. Alistair is found at his MIT office. [...] Walter, having read through Alistair's writings on time travel, offers to go in and talk to Alistair first before the armed officers attempt to seize him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Really, Fanny, this is {{the most}} unaccountable thing I ever heard of. But you'd better sit down, while I speak to you," [...] and Fanny sat down on the sofa. [...] "I think I {{understood}} you rightly, when you desired me, less than a <b>month</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>to</b> inform Lord Ballindine that circumstances--that is, his own conduct--obliged you to decline the honour of his alliance. Did you not do so spontaneously, and of your own accord?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What I say,' said Trevor. 'The old man you saw to-day in {{the studio}} was Baron Hausberg. He is a great friend of mine, buys all my {{pictures}} {{and that sort of}} thing, and gave me a commission a <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> paint him as a beggar. Que voulez-vous? La fantaisie d'un millionnaire! And I must say he made a magnificent figure in his rags, or perhaps I should say in my rags; they are an old suit I got in Spain.' ...|$|R
500|$|When {{their efforts}} to get the Flood {{manuscript}} published failed, the Earps decided to appeal to Burns, whose own book was near publication. But he was not interested. His book {{was about to be}} published, free of the constraints imposed by a collaboration with Earp. Burns wrote them, [...] "I should not now care to undertake another book which, in part at least, would be upon much the same lines... I should have been delighted six <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> accept your offer but it is too late now. My book has championed Mr. Earp's cause throughout and I believe will vindicate his reputation in Tombstone in a way that he will like." [...] When Burns turned them down, Josephine actively worked to stop the publication of his book, fearful that {{their efforts to}} publish Wyatt's biography would be thwarted as a result.|$|E
500|$|They {{discover}} a nearby planet that {{shows signs of}} a previous civilization but has been stripped of all industrial and mechanical elements, similar to destruction found several <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> Federation outposts bordering the Romulan Neutral Zone. Moments later, they detect and are then met by a much larger, cube-shaped vessel which does not answer their hails. Guinan warns Picard that the ship belongs to the Borg, a powerful, cyborg-like race that nearly wiped out her people, scattering the survivors across the galaxy, and again urges Picard to leave immediately or face certain destruction. Though Picard orders the Enterprise shields raised, a single, speechless Borg transports into Engineering and begins to probe the Enterprises computer systems. Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) initially attempts to incapacitate the intruder with his phaser set on stun, which has absolutely no effect, and is forced to increase power in order to neutralize the Borg. Immediately afterwards, a second Borg appears and [...] continues probing the computer, proving to be immune to phaser fire. Completing its mission, it strips several components from the dead Borg, then transports away and the dead Borg disintegrates. The Borg ship then contacts the Enterprise and demands their surrender. The Borg then immobilizes the Enterprise with a tractor beam, disables the shields, and uses a cutting beam to slice into the saucer section to remove a cross-section of the ship, killing eighteen people.|$|E

2500|$|However, in June 2003, it was {{confirmed}} that Lisa would {{once again be}} returning to the serial. Benjamin said, [...] "I couldn't believe it when I got the call a few <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> ask if I would return to Walford. I didn't think Lisa would give up baby Lou without one last fight." [...] The return storyline was temporary, allowing Lisa to usurp Phil and once again take custody of her daughter, with the help of Den Watts. The character then disappeared, exiting in November 2003.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 January, in {{response}} to the previous days' events, President Mubarak spoke on national television after midnight local time {{for the first time since}} the protests began.

2500|$|On March 31, 2009 it was {{reported}} by various news outlets that a Conservative official claimed Mulroney {{was no longer a}} member of the party. They claimed his membership expired in 2006 and was not renewed. Additionally, Mulroney allegedly [...] "called a senior party official two <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> ask that his name be pulled off all party lists and materials and that communications with him cease." [...] However, a Mulroney confidante, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the party's claims preposterous. 'He's part of the history of this party, you can't rewrite history. If they're worried about branding, then shut the inquiry down. They're the ones who called the inquiry.' [...] " ...|$|E

6000|$|Her ladyship's brows went up; {{her eyes}} narrowed again, and a frown came between them. [...] "You are mighty mysterious," [...] said she, looking {{from one to the}} other of the men, and bethinking her that it was not the first time she had found them so; bethinking her, too--jumping, woman-like, to rash conclusions--that in this mystery that linked them might lie the true secret of her husband's aversion to his son and of his oath a <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> see that same son hang if Mr. Caryll succumbed to the wound he had taken. With some women, to suspect a thing is to believe that thing. Her ladyship was of these. She set too high value upon her acumen, upon the keenness of her instincts.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You a good Mussulman! Why, I {{thought you}} had sent two <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> Archbishop Murad <b>to</b> Paris, urging King Louis to support you, because, amongst other reasons, being a Christian prince, you would defend the faith and {{privileges}} of the Maronites.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{have not}} got any to speak of," [...] George said, {{flushing}} a little.

The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was trying}} to see how Lyon would dispose his troops. I meant {{to tell you about}} a gentleman we met in the street car, a Major Sherman who {{used to be in the}} army. Mr. Brinsmade knows him, and Judge Whipple, and many other {{prominent}} men here. He came to St. Louis some <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> take the position of president of the Fifth Street Line. He is the keenest, the most original man I have ever met.

It was quite a mistake that anything had happened--Mrs. Donner had pulled through unscathed. She had been but {{a day or two}} at the most in danger, for her family and friends--the best influences--had rallied to her support: the flurry was all over. She was now perfectly safe.

50|$|She {{also has}} stellar records {{as a police}} {{official}} in Karnataka by removing of orderlies and escort vehicles used by former Karnataka chief minister B.S.Yeddyurappa and taking on local politicians or her own superiors. In July 2017, Roopa was transferred from her post as Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Prisons, a post she took over barely a <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> the commissioner for traffic and road safety. All because, she took on her own superiors, DGP Satyanarayana Rao, to highlight wide-scale corruption and mismanagement in Bengaluru central jail, including preferential treatment given to All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) general secretary V.K.Sasikala. She accused DGP Satyanarayana Rao of taking a bribe of ₹2 crore to allow Sasikala to operate a personal kitchen and provide her with other luxurious amenities {{to her in the}} jail.

She {{is from a}} race called the Ramura, whose chemistry is such that any other race fails to remember them after a few hours, and that her race is [...] "impervious" [...] to technologies such as tricorders. They release a pheromone that does this. She claims that she came aboard Voyager a <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> track down a Ramuran fugitive, and that during that time she and Voyagers First Officer, Chakotay, fell in love. The crew looks into it and evidence seems to support her claim {{that she was on}} Voyager. Chakotay does not remember her, but as they work together he understands that he could have developed feelings for her.|$|R
