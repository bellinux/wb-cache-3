[...] "I picked a few that I felt I could add some magic to, and worked on those. I also came up with several ideas that I sent to Marty that {{he put his hands}} on."

500|$|When {{describing}} the film's accuracy, Burton explained, [...] "it's {{not like a}} completely hardcore realistic biopic. In doing a biopic you can't help but get inside the person's spirit a little bit, so for <b>me,</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the film {{is trying to be}} through Ed a little bit. So it's got an overly optimistic quality to it." [...] Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating {{he did not want to}} ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. Burton decided not to depict the darker side of Wood's life because his letters never alluded to this aspect and remained upbeat. To this end, Burton wanted to make the film through Wood's eyes. He said in an interview, [...] "I've never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy– saying in, like, five sentences what it would take most normal people one [...] Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, and I always found that somewhat touching; it gives them a surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling." ...|$|E

500|$|Pamela's {{marriage}} to Bobby Ewing {{is central to}} understanding her character. The couple produced the opening scene of Dallas when the show first aired in 1978, with Bobby bringing his new bride home to meet Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing. [...] Their complex relationship has often been {{compared to that of}} Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. When asked about whether or not series creator David Jacobs had this parallel relationship in mind from the start, he said: [...] "Yes, guilty (laughs)". Relations can be made from William Shakespeare's two feuding families in Romeo and Juliet, the Montagues and the Capulets. These families represent the Barnes and the Ewing feuding families, with Pamela being portrayed as Juliet Capulet and Bobby as Romeo Montague. According to Patrick Duffy, being immediately paired off with Principal was a challenge. He said, [...] "We were {{in a constant state of}} competition. We were very territorial in front of the camera, and it was a strain." [...] However, their off-screen relationship significantly improved in the show's third season, with Duffy explaining: [...] "I developed an appreciation for her, and I think for the first time she started to trust <b>me.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> the best scenes on the show were between Victoria and me, and they happened after we got comfortable with each other." ...|$|E

Sometimes they have a wistful melancholy, a sense of struggling to carry on, {{trying to find some}} meaning in life ("Backseat", [...] "Feelin' Massachusetts").

It's nasty reviews in beautiful language, and that's what I want," [...] she says.

And I always have a great time working with her. There was no ego involved, you know, me - that was the first video that I'd ever {{stepped up to the plate}} to literally co-direct. I'd always been very opinionated and very you know, I always voice my ideas and whatnot in my videos, but this was the first one I actually took credit for in co-directing. And she was just so great and generous in teaching <b>me</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the ropes and learning about the different camera angles and you know, all the facets and details that go into making a video. So, she was really great and we had such fun with that. [...] And she's amazing.

2500|$|Tabari relates on the {{authority}} of Ibn Ishaq that when Jesus was about nine or ten years old, his mother Mary would send him to a Jewish religious school. But whenever the teacher tried to teach him anything, he found that Jesus already knew it. The teacher exclaimed, [...] "Do you not marvel at the son of this widow? Every time I teach him anything, I find that he knows it far better than I do!" [...] Tabari further relates on {{the authority}} of Ismail al-Suddi that [...] "when Jesus was in his youth, his mother committed him [...] to study the Torah. While Jesus played with the youths of his village, he used {{to tell them what}} their parents were doing." [...] Sa'id ibn Jubayr, according to Tabari, is said to have reported that Jesus would say to one of his fellow playmates in the religious school, [...] "Your parents have kept such and such food for you, would you give <b>me</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> it?" [...] Jesus would usually tell his fellow pupils in the religious school what their parents ate and what they have kept for them when they return home.
