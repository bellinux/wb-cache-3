5|$|After Cage {{finished}} {{teaching at}} the New School {{in the summer of}} 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street that she used as a studio and living space. Supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society, Ono allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961, with people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending, and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be Stepped On, which was a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.|$|E
25|$|The monument, by Gerard Johnson, is <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> above Shakespeare's grave. It {{features}} {{a bust of}} the poet, who holds a quill pen {{in one hand and}} a piece of paper in another. His arms are resting on a cushion. Above him is the Shakespeare family's coat of arms, on either side of which stands two allegorical figures: one, representing Labour, holds a spade, the other, representing Rest, holds a torch and a skull.|$|E
25|$|Depending on culture, {{there may}} be varying degrees of {{separation}} {{between men and women}} and different levels of privacy. Typically, the entire room, or a stall or cubicle containing a toilet, is lockable. Urinals, if present in a men's toilet, are typically <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> with or without a divider between them. In the most basic form, a public toilet may be not much more than an open latrine. Another form is a street urinal known as a pissoir, after the French term.|$|E
50|$|Unsuitable {{storage and}} display environments pose great risks to a clock’s condition. Placement of <b>a</b> clock <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{unstable}} surface or non secure <b>mounting</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> can cause <b>a</b> clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.|$|R

50|$|The kitchen also retains many {{original}} features including: a sink with legs, sideboard, {{the serving}} hatch and stove recess, and the linoleum floor covering with its cardboard backing. Metal bracing {{for a hot}} water service is <b>mounted</b> high <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall.</b> Similar panelling to that used in the bathroom lines the stove recess and the splashback between the sink-top and window sill.|$|R
50|$|A toilet roll holder, {{also known}} as a toilet paper dispenser, is an item that holds a roll of toilet paper. Common models include a hinged length of wire <b>mounted</b> {{horizontally}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>a</b> thicker axle either recessed into <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> or <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> frame, or a freestanding vertical pole <b>on</b> <b>a</b> base. In recent years, automatic toilet paper dispensers which automatically fold and cut the toilet paper are being installed in public toilets.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the launch}} of the What on Earth? Wallbook the word wallbook has been defined in Macmillan's Open Dictionary as a new noun meaning: a large printed book which can be <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> ...|$|E
50|$|A Wallbook {{is a large}} printed {{book that}} is {{designed}} also to be <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall.</b> For example, its design may be concertina folded {{so it can be}} read like a book or hung on a wall.|$|E
5000|$|Less {{physical}} space: Most tankless {{water heaters}} can be <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> or internally in a building's structure. This means less physical space must {{be dedicated to}} heating water. Even systems that can't be mounted on walls take up less space than a tank-type water heater.|$|E
50|$|Depending <b>on</b> the <b>mounting,</b> one can {{distinguish}} between side-looking, downward- and upward-looking ADCPs. A bottom-mounted ADCP can measure {{the speed and}} direction of currents at equal intervals {{all the way to}} the surface. <b>Mounted</b> sideways <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> or bridge piling in rivers or canals, it can measure the current profile from bank to bank. In very deep water they can be lowered on cables from the surface.|$|R
50|$|Rear-projection {{interactive}} whiteboards {{locate the}} projector or emissive display behind the whiteboard sensing surface {{so that no}} shadows occur. This also avoids the problem with front-projection boards that the presenter has {{to look into the}} projector light while speaking to the audience. However, rear-projection systems are generally significantly more expensive than front-projection boards, are often very large, and cannot be <b>mounted</b> flush <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall,</b> although in-wall installations are possible.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. Dr. King's {{memorial}} is {{the first}} in Maryland to be erected in his honor. It stands in Arnold's Anne Arundel Community College's west campus <b>on</b> <b>a</b> well-maintained terrace overlooking an outdoor amphitheater. Behind the statue, five bronze plaques <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stone <b>wall</b> quote King's speeches calling for equal opportunities in education and a just society. The statue is nine feet six inches tall and <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> five-foot granite base.|$|R
50|$|These cameras can be {{plugged into}} the USB port of any {{computer}} (most of them now have USB capability) and pictures can be taken of any camera scene. All that is necessary is for the camera to be <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> bracket and pointed in the desired direction.|$|E
50|$|The model 302 was {{the first}} Western Electric {{telephone}} to include the ringer and network circuitry in the same desktop unit. Earlier Western Electric telephones required {{the use of an}} external subscriber set (subset), containing the ringer and network circuitry, typically <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> or desk side.|$|E
50|$|The {{display on}} offer with the Edge 91z AIO {{was a true}} 1080p HD and, when <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall,</b> was {{reported}} to resemble a HDTV or a large screen monitor. A drawback of the screen was indicated to be the glass front panel, which reflected ambient light as well as objects within a room.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{standard}} central vacuum system {{is equipped with}} a 30 foot (9 m) hose, plus standard cleaning tools similar to those used with portable vacuum cleaners. For further convenience, some owners will keep a hose and set of tools on each floor of a multi-story building. When not in use, the hose is loosely coiled around <b>a</b> wire rack <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> closet <b>wall,</b> or <b>on</b> the back of a door.|$|R
5000|$|A {{well for}} holy water {{is on the}} site and a hybrid rose has been {{cultivated}} called [...] "Our Lady of Yankalilla". The South Australia Tourism Commission has developed a marketing brochure for the shrine entitled [...] "Mary Among the Eucalypts". The Australian artist Pro Hart donated a painting to the shrine and a large mural of the Virgin of Yankalilla has been <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> exterior <b>wall</b> of the retreat centre adjacent to the church.|$|R
50|$|On the {{way into}} the theatre, viewers pick up a {{reflective}} plastic panel <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flexible stalk. The panel sits in a seat cupholder or on the floor adjacent to the seat. A large LED display is <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rear <b>wall</b> that displays caption characters in mirror image. Viewers move the panels into position (usually below the movie screen or stage) so they can read the reflected captions and watch the presentation. Others seated alongside do not watch, or usually even see, the captions.|$|R
5000|$|A spalliera (Plural: spalliere) is a {{decorated}} backboard <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall,</b> often behind a cassone (a wooden chest used for storage), or as a headboard to a bed. It is usually {{made out of}} wood and embellished with decorative aspects such as intricate carving or painting, and is gilded as well. They were common in Renaissance Tuscany.|$|E
50|$|The series had no {{recurring}} characters, {{except for}} the hypochondric patient Roger Kaputnik and his personal doctor, who typically concluded every monthly installment. Kaputnik was a self-caricature. Berg also caricatured his colleagues whenever he drew gags based around an office. Chief editor William M. Gaines head was often seen <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> like a taxidermed mooses head.|$|E
50|$|The {{area around}} the Savoy on Holderness Road was {{attacked}} on 17 March by a Heinkel 111. Twelve {{people were killed and}} twenty-two injured, many leaving the theatre after a film. They were the last civilians casualties of the Second World War to be caused by a manned aircraft. A memorial plaque is <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> at this site.|$|E
50|$|In {{the central}} area {{there is a}} wood stove placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stone hearth and <b>an</b> oil lamp <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> post. Interior <b>walls</b> are {{original}} horsehair plaster and unpainted paneling. Wooden interior columns are rounded rather than chamfered as in other meetinghouses in Dutchess County.|$|R
50|$|A {{distinctive}} type of crane was {{the warehouse}} wall crane or 'whip'. The ram was <b>mounted</b> vertically <b>on</b> <b>an</b> outside <b>wall</b> with <b>a</b> small jib or fixed pulley above it. The space available by external mounting allowed {{the use of}} long cylinders and very long lifts, spanning several floors.|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} forced convection in a channel with hot solid block inside a square porous block <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bottom <b>wall</b> was carried out. The lattice Boltzmann method {{was applied for}} numerical simulations. The fluid flow in the porous media was simulated by Brinkman-Forchheimer model. The effects of parameters such as porosity and thermal conductivity ratio over flow pattern and thermal field were investigated. In this paper the effects of mentioned parameters were discussed in detail. The result show with increasing the thermal conductivity ratio and porosity the fluid temperature will reduce...|$|R
