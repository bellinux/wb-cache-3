2500|$|In {{materials}} science, creep (sometimes called [...] cold flow) is {{the tendency}} of a solid material to move slowly or deform permanently {{under the influence of}} mechanical stresses. It can occur as a result of long-term exposure to high levels of stress that are still below the yield strength of the <b>material.</b> <b>Creep</b> is more severe in materials that are subjected to heat for long periods, and generally increases as they near their melting point.|$|E
50|$|Ionization of {{molecules}} {{can lead to}} radiolysis (breaking chemical bonds), and formation of highly reactive free radicals. These free radicals may then react chemically with neighbouring materials even after the original radiation has stopped. (e.g., ozone cracking of polymers by ozone formed by ionization of air). Ionizing radiation can disrupt crystal lattices in metals, causing them to become amorphous, with consequent swelling, <b>material</b> <b>creep,</b> and embrittlement. Ionizing radiation can also accelerate existing chemical reactions such as polymerization and corrosion, by contributing to the activation energy required for the reaction. Optical materials darken under the effect of ionizing radiation.|$|E
50|$|The first creep testing {{machines}} {{were created in}} 1948 in Britain to test materials for aircraft {{to see how they}} would stand in high altitudes, temperature and pressure. The {{machines were}} first developed to further calculate and understand the steady rate of creep in materials. Creep is the tendency of a material to change form over time after facing high temperature and stress. Creep increases with temperature and it is more common when a material is exposed to high temperatures for a long time or at the melting point of the <b>material.</b> <b>Creep</b> machines are used to understand the creep of materials and determine which type can do the job better, which is important when making and designing materials for everyday uses. They most commonly test the creep of alloys and plastics for the understanding of their properties and advantages of one material's use over another.|$|E

50|$|Specifically, {{viscoelasticity}} is {{a molecular}} rearrangement. When a stress {{is applied to}} a viscoelastic material such as a polymer, parts of the long polymer chain change positions. This movement or rearrangement is called creep. Polymers remain a solid material even when these parts of their chains are rearranging in order to accompany the stress, and as this occurs, it creates a back stress in the material. When the back stress is the same magnitude as the applied stress, the <b>material</b> no longer <b>creeps.</b> When the original stress is taken away, the accumulated back stresses will cause the polymer to return to its original form. The <b>material</b> <b>creeps,</b> which gives the prefix visco-, and the material fully recovers, which gives the suffix -elasticity.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} support <b>material</b> <b>creep</b> on failure of ceramic {{thermal barrier coating}} (TBC) was studied. A {{simplified}} cylindrical model TBC-system was used: Instead of Ni-superalloy and bond coat (BC) the substrates consisted of a Fe–Cr–Al–Y-alloy with BC-like chemical composition, namely Fecralloy with low creep strength and oxide dispersoid strengthened PM 2000 Fe–Cr–Al–Y samples. After sandblasting the substrates surface, yttria stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings were applied by air plasma spraying. Slices were extracted from the cylindrical specimens and the lateral slice-surfaces were polished. Then they were thermally cycled to assess the effect of support <b>material</b> <b>creep</b> on delamination induced TBC failure. The damage evolution was examined at the lateral slice cross-sectional surface after different numbers of thermal cycles. The study shows a significant delay and deceleration of delamination crack growth for the low creep strength Fecralloy, in contrast to observations made for the high creep strength substrate material. The experimental results indicate that stresses which promote delamination failure are partially relaxed by creep deformation in the near interface regions, which {{appear to be more}} pronounced for support materials with low creep strength...|$|E

This is used in a mechanical model to compute the distribution of thermo-mechanical stress in the ceramic membrane-electrode assembly of the cell. The resulting risk of fracture failure is determined by means of Weibull analysis. Part I of this work covers the dynamic operating properties of the SOFC and the time scale of <b>material</b> <b>creep</b> in its ceramic components. This work, Part II, deals with the risk of fracture failure related to transient operating scenarios, discusses its dependency on the operating conditions and derives a low-risk operating strategy. Contrary to the common perception, thermal gradients are found to have little impact on thermo-mechanical stress in the studied SOFC. Failure-relevant stress levels arise merely due to thermal mismatch of the ceramic layers. Regarding the operating strategy, the dynamics of changes in operating conditions are of minor importance for the resulting risk of failure, while operating strategies aiming at a constant mean cell temperature prove to be advantageous. The consideration of <b>material</b> <b>creep</b> is shown to be essential for a sound analysis of thermo-mechanical stress and risk of fracture in the investigated SOFC...|$|E
