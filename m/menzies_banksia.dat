5|$|The {{common name}} of {{firewood}} banksia {{was a result}} of its quick-burning properties. Other names recorded include <b>Menzies</b> <b>banksia,</b> firewheel banksia, port wine banksia, flame banksia, and in the cut flower industry, strawberry banksia and raspberry frost banksia. The Beeloo Whadjuk Noongar people of the Perth region knew it as the Mungyt. Despite its variation across its range, George noted that B.menziesii was a clearly defined species, and no formal division into subspecies was warranted.|$|E
25|$|Thiele and Ladiges' {{arrangement}} remained current {{only until}} 1999, when George's {{treatment of the}} genus for the Flora of Australia series of monographs was published. This was essentially a revision of George's 1981 arrangement, which took into account some of Thiele and Ladiges' data, but rejected their overall arrangement. With respect to B.ser. Banksia, George's 1999 arrangement was identical to his 1981 arrangement, except that B.baxteri (Baxter's Banksia) and B.menziesii (<b>Menzies</b> <b>Banksia)</b> were exchanged in phyletic order.|$|E

50|$|Since 1998, Austin Mast {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae, which comprises Banksia and Dryandra. Masts analysis strongly supports Thieles placement of B. victoriae, finding it to fall within a clade with B. menziesii (<b>Menzies</b> <b>Banksia),</b> B. burdettii, B. hookeriana (Hookers Banksia) and B. prionotes (Acorn Banksia), {{all of which are}} members of Thiele and Ladiges Cratistylis. Overall, the inferred phylogeny is very greatly different from Georges arrangement, and provides compelling evidence for the paraphyly of Banksia with respect to Dryandra. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by transferring Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus they also redefined the autonym B. subg. Banksia as containing the species not having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thieles nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. victoriae is placed in B. subg. Banksia.|$|E
