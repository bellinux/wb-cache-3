Julia Wallace, critic for The Village Voice, wrote [...] "that you can't build a movie around lingering, soulful {{shots of the}} No. 1 train zooming {{up and down the}} West Side." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film two stars out of four, writing that, despite the well-done acting and directing, it was [...] "dramatically tepid."

[...] Like Lumenick, he also praised the acting but wrote that the film didn't [...] "go anywhere definite or distinctive enough to leave a lasting impression."

[...] Scott Weinberg of Moviefone wrote, [...] "While not exactly what you'd call a bad movie, Adrift in Manhattan is simply too predictable, familiar and obvious to warrant {{much in the way of}} attention or enthusiasm."

Through the particular structure of farming and the social relationships of the community, tree growing lagged behind for a long time in Opheusden and only adapted itself with difficulty to market requirements. This difficulty was also associated with the limited variety of culture possible on the clay soil. Until 1932 times had frequently been prosperous, while the independence of the holdings made the farmers less vulnerable to set-backs. After the Second World War, in which the village had been almost entirely destroyed, a healthy spirit of enterprise had grown up among the villagers, so that the future could be viewed with optimism. This enterprise was visible in the effort put into reconstruction, in the activeness of the local association of tree-growers, the high membership of the Dutch General Inspection Service for Field Crops and the greater desire for technical education. <p/...|$|E
