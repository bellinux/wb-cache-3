5|$|The <b>mammary</b> glands {{of mammals}} are {{specialized}} to produce milk, {{the primary source}} of nutrition for newborns. The monotremes branched early from other mammals and do not have the nipples seen in most mammals, but they do have <b>mammary</b> glands. The young lick the milk from a <b>mammary</b> patch on the mother's belly.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{accounts}} for 65% of the molecular weight of T4 and 59% of T3. Fifteen to 20mg of iodine {{is concentrated in}} thyroid tissue and hormones, but 70% of all iodine in the body is found in other tissues, including <b>mammary</b> glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, fetal thymus, cerebro-spinal fluid and choroid plexus, arterial walls, the cervix, and salivary glands. In the cells of those tissues, iodide enters directly by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). The action of iodine in <b>mammary</b> tissue is related to fetal and neonatal development, but in the other tissues, it is (at least) partially unknown.|$|E
5|$|Milk lipids are {{secreted}} in {{a unique}} manner by lactocytes, which are specialized epithelial cells within the alveoli of the lactating <b>mammary</b> gland.|$|E
5|$|Most {{primates}} {{have two}} <b>mammary</b> glands, {{but the number}} and positions vary between species within strepsirrhines. Lorises have two pairs, while others, like the ring-tailed lemur, have one pair on the chest (pectoral). The aye-aye also has two <b>mammary</b> glands, but they are located near the groin (inguinal). In females, the clitoris is sometimes enlarged and pendulous, resembling the male penis, which can make sex identification difficult for human observers. The clitoris may also have a bony structure in it, similar to the baculum (penis bone) in males. Most male primates have a baculum, but it is typically larger in strepsirrhines and usually forked at the tip.|$|E
5|$|Spaying or neutering {{increases}} life expectancy: {{one study}} found neutered male cats live {{twice as long as}} intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females. Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of <b>mammary</b> cancer.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster {{is prone}} to genetic {{abnormalities}} in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. They can develop tumours of the <b>mammary</b> glands, lungs, uterus, and ovaries. Tumours can also develop if the animal is exposed to chemical carcinogens. Due to having slow locomotion and an insignificant response to bright lights and humans, as well as having a low population density, field studies allow scientists to study entire populations in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{is one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels harvested from {{another part of the}} body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal <b>mammary</b> artery. Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they were}} named, the {{proteins}} {{have been found}} to be differentially expressed in other glands that secrete products directly into the external environment. These include lacrimal, parotid, submaxillary, sublingual, preputial and <b>mammary</b> glands. In some species, such as cats and pigs, Mups appear not to be expressed in urine at all and are mainly found in saliva. Sometimes the term urinary Mups (uMups) is used to distinguish those Mups expressed in urine from those in other tissues.|$|E
5|$|The {{milk fat}} globule is {{surrounded}} by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting <b>mammary</b> epithelial cell (lactocyte). This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM. While MFGM only makes up an estimated 2% to 6% of the total milk fat globule, it is an especially rich phospholipid source, accounting for the majority of total milk phospholipids. In contrast, the inner core of the milk fat globule is composed predominantly of triacylglycerols.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes have genital slits on the {{underside}} of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two <b>mammary</b> slits, each housing one nipple, one {{on each side of the}} genital slit. The ability to stow their reproductive organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Romneys {{sold their}} primary {{residence}} in Belmont and their ski chalet in Utah, leaving them an estate along Lake Winnipesaukee in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and an oceanfront {{home in the}} La Jolla district of San Diego, California, which they had purchased the year before. The La Jolla home proved beneficial in location and climate for Ann Romney's multiple sclerosis therapies and for recovering from her late 2008 diagnosis of <b>mammary</b> ductal carcinoma in situ and subsequent lumpectomy. Both it and the New Hampshire location were near some of their grandchildren. Romney maintained his voting registration in Massachusetts, however, and bought a smaller condominium in Belmont during 2010.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds have streamlined, {{spindle-shaped}} {{bodies with}} reduced or non-existent external ear flaps, rounded heads, flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, and small tails. Pinniped skulls have large eye orbits, short snouts and a constricted interorbital region. They are unique among carnivorans in that their orbital walls are significantly {{shaped by the}} maxilla and are not limited by certain facial bones. Compared to other carnivorans, their teeth tend to be fewer in number (especially incisors and back molars), are pointed and cone-shaped, and lack carnassials. The walrus has unique upper canines that are elongated into tusks. The <b>mammary</b> glands and genitals of pinnipeds can retract into the body.|$|E
5|$|When {{it reaches}} the pouch, the {{underdeveloped}} joey suckles the teat {{of one of the}} four <b>mammary</b> glands while the others recede. The joey remains attached to the teat for 100–125 days, after which it ceases its attachment but remains in the pouch and continues to suckle, but more intermittently. The joey begins to leave the pouch and eat grass at around 200 days when it is more developed. It still suckles, more forcefully but less regularly. By 250 days, the joey no longer needs the pouch, and it is fully weaned at around 300–350 days. The tammar wallaby has been observed to engage in alloparental care, in which an adult may adopt another's young. Male tammars may live for around 11 years, while females live for 14 years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mammary</b> {{stem cells}} provide {{the source of}} cells for growth of the <b>mammary</b> gland during puberty and {{gestation}} and {{play an important role}} in carcinogenesis of the breast. <b>Mammary</b> stem cells have been isolated from human and mouse tissue as well as from cell lines derived from the <b>mammary</b> gland. Single such cells can give rise to both the luminal and myoepithelial cell types of the gland, and have been shown to have the ability to regenerate the entire organ in mice.|$|E
25|$|Historically, about 50 {{percent of}} <b>mammary</b> tumors in dogs {{were found to}} be malignant, {{although}} taking into account tumor behavior, one study has estimated true malignancy in <b>mammary</b> tumors to be 21 to 22 percent. Adenomas and fibroadenomas make up the benign types. Malignant <b>mammary</b> tumors are divided into sarcomas, carcinosarcomas, inflammatory carcinomas (usually anaplastic carcinomas), and carcinomas (including adenocarcinomas), which are the most common. Inflammatory carcinomas describe tumors that are fast growing and have bruising, edema, and pain, and can also cause disseminated intravascular coagulation. They are the most malignant type of canine <b>mammary</b> tumor.|$|E
25|$|While living mammal {{species can}} be {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} milk-producing <b>mammary</b> glands in the females, other features are required when classifying fossils, because <b>mammary</b> glands and other soft-tissue features are not visible in fossils.|$|E
25|$|The Notch pathway {{plays a role}} in {{controlling}} stem cell proliferation for several cell types including hematopoietic, neural and <b>mammary</b> SCs. Components of this pathway have been proposed to act as oncogenes in <b>mammary</b> and other tumors.|$|E
25|$|A <b>mammary</b> tumor is a {{neoplasm}} {{originating in}} the <b>mammary</b> gland. It is a common finding in older female dogs and cats that are not spayed, but they are found in other animals as well. The <b>mammary</b> glands in dogs and cats are associated with their nipples and extend from {{the underside of the}} chest to the groin {{on both sides of the}} midline. There are many differences between <b>mammary</b> tumors in animals and breast cancer in humans, including tumor type, malignancy, and treatment options. The prevalence in dogs is about three times that of women. In dogs, <b>mammary</b> tumors are the second most common tumor (after skin tumors) over all and the most common tumor in female dogs with a reported incidence of 3.4%. Multiple studies have documented that spaying female dogs when young greatly decreases their risk of developing <b>mammary</b> neoplasia when aged. Compared with female dogs left intact, those spayed before puberty have 0.5% of the risk, those spayed after one estrous cycle have 8.0% of the risk, and dogs spayed after two estrous cycles have 26.0% of the risk of developing <b>mammary</b> neoplasia later in life. Overall, unspayed female dogs have a seven times greater risk of developing <b>mammary</b> neoplasia than do those that are spayed. While the benefit of spaying decreases with each estrous cycle, some benefit has been demonstrated in female dogs even up to 9 years of age. There is a much lower risk (about 1 percent) in male dogs and a risk in cats about half that of dogs.|$|E
25|$|Appearance and {{location}} of the tumor is enough to identify it as a <b>mammary</b> tumor. Biopsy will give type and invasiveness of the tumor. In addition, newer studies showed that certain gene expression patterns are associated with malignant behaviour of canine <b>mammary</b> tumors.|$|E
25|$|The human <b>mammary</b> gland is {{composed}} of several cell types, including adipose (fat cells), muscle, ductal epithelium, and <b>mammary</b> epithelium (referred to sometimes as lactocytes). The <b>mammary</b> epithelium is the site for excretion of raw materials into the milk supply, including choline. This occurs, for the fat portion of the milk, by apocrine secretion, where vacuoles containing materials bud off the cell into the lumen (storage) of the alveolus (milk secretion gland). From here the milk will be released upon stimulation with oxytocin via suckling.|$|E
25|$|Calcium reduces cell {{proliferation}} and induces differentiation in <b>mammary</b> glands.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{function}} of the breasts, as <b>mammary</b> glands, is the feeding and nourishing of an infant with breast milk during the maternal lactation period. The round shape of the breast helps to limit the loss of maternal body heat. Milk production depends upon a higher-temperature environment for the milk-production {{function of the}} <b>mammary</b> gland tissues, the lactiferous ducts.|$|E
25|$|Hedgehogs: <b>Mammary</b> gland {{adenocarcinoma}} is {{the most}} common tumor of the hedgehog.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mammary</b> {{tumors are}} {{the third most}} common {{neoplasia}} in cats, following lymphoid and skin cancers. The incidence of <b>mammary</b> tumors in cats is reduced by 91 percent in cats spayed prior to six months of age and by 86 percent in cats spayed prior to one year, according to one study. Siamese cats and Japanese breeds seem to have increased risk, and obesity {{also appears to be}} a factor in tumor development. Malignant tumors make up 80 to 96 percent of <b>mammary</b> tumors in cats, almost all adenocarcinomas. Male cats may also develop <b>mammary</b> adenocarcinoma, albeit rarely, and the clinical course is similar to female cats. As in dogs, tumor size is an important prognostic factor, although for tumors less than three centimeters the individual size is less predictive. According to one study, cats with tumors less than three cm had an average survival time of 21 months, and cats with tumors greater than three cm had an average survival of 12 months. About 10 percent of cat <b>mammary</b> tumors have estrogen receptors, so spaying at the time of surgery has little effect on recurrence or survival time. Metastasis tends to be to the lungs and lymph nodes, and rarely to bone. Diagnosis and treatment is similar to the dog. There is a better prognosis with bilateral radical surgery (removing the both <b>mammary</b> chains) than with more conservative surgery. Doxorubicin has shown some promise in treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} carcinogenesis of canine <b>mammary</b> {{tumors are}} not completely understand. However, the increasing information on molecular pathways involved in the carcinogenesis of this canine tumor has potential to complement and refine the current diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this tumor type. Furthermore, current data show that significant similarities and differences exist between canine and human <b>mammary</b> tumors at the molecular level.|$|E
25|$|High {{calcium intake}} {{decreases}} fat-induced epithelial hypoproliferation of <b>mammary</b> gland and chemically induced carcinogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>mammary</b> {{tumors in}} mice are adenocarcinomas. They {{can be caused}} by viral infection. Recurrence rates are high, and {{therefore}} there is a poor prognosis. There is frequently local tissue invasion and metastasis to the lungs. A well known tumor virus of the mouse is the mouse <b>mammary</b> tumor virus, which may be {{the most common cause of}} this tumor in mice.|$|E
25|$|Hamsters and gerbils: <b>Mammary</b> tumors {{tend to be}} benign in hamsters and {{malignant}} in gerbils.|$|E
25|$|Normal {{breast tissue}} does not express H19 RNA, except during puberty and {{pregnancy}} in the <b>mammary</b> glands.|$|E
25|$|In females, H19 is {{expressed}} postnatally during puberty and pregnancy in the <b>mammary</b> glands, {{and in the}} uterus during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|CD36 {{is found}} on platelets, erythrocytes, monocytes, {{differentiated}} adipocytes, skeletal muscle, <b>mammary</b> epithelial cells, spleen cells and some skin microdermal endothelial cells.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{fatty acids}} are formed from {{carbohydrates}} predominantly {{in the liver}} and adipose tissue, {{as well as in}} the <b>mammary</b> glands during lactation.|$|E
25|$|A human {{homologue}} of the <b>mammary</b> {{virus has}} been described in 1971 and linked to human breast cancer in several small epidemiologic studies.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, doctors Charles Bailey, Teruo Hirose and George Green {{used the}} {{internal}} <b>mammary</b> artery {{instead of the}} saphenous vein for the grafting.|$|E
25|$|Other {{components}} {{found in}} raw cow's milk are living white blood cells, <b>mammary</b> gland cells, various bacteria, {{and a large}} number of active enzymes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mammary</b> {{tumors in}} dogs are {{potentially}} benign or malignant. They occur most commonly in non-spayed females or female that were spayed later in life.|$|E
