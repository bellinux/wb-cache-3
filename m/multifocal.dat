5|$|BHD can be {{suggested}} by clinical findings but is definitively diagnosed by molecular genetic testing to detect mutations in the FLCN gene. The classical clinical triad includes benign growths of the hair follicles; pulmonary cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax; and bilateral, <b>multifocal</b> renal tumors.|$|E
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé can be {{difficult}} to diagnose from symptoms alone, because hereditary renal cancers, pneumothorax, and cutaneous tumors occur with other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, <b>multifocal</b> kidney tumors similar to those seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel–Lindau disease (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), hereditary papillary renal cancer (papillary renal cell carcinoma), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with examination of the tumors' histology.|$|E
5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, <b>multifocal</b> retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E
5|$|Monoclonal antibodies, {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of {{interest}} and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive <b>multifocal</b> leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E
5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive <b>multifocal</b> leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E
25|$|<b>Multifocal</b> {{dystonia}} affects {{many different}} parts of the body.|$|E
25|$|<b>Multifocal</b> {{contact lenses}} (e.g. bifocals or progressives) are {{comparable}} to spectacles with bifocals or progressive lenses because they have multiple focal points. <b>Multifocal</b> contact lenses are typically designed for constant viewing {{through the center of}} the lens, but some designs do incorporate a shift in lens position to view through the reading power (similar to bifocal glasses).|$|E
25|$|Correction of {{presbyopia}} (a {{need for}} a reading prescription different from the prescription needed for distance) presents an additional challenge in the fitting of contact lenses. Two main strategies exist: <b>multifocal</b> lenses and monovision.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of VKH {{is based on}} the clinical presentation; the diagnostic differential is extensive, and includes (almong others) sympathetic ophthalmia, sarcoidosis, primary intraocular B-cell lymphoma, posterior scleritis, uveal effusion syndrome, tuberculosis, syphilis, and <b>multifocal</b> choroidopathy syndromes.|$|E
25|$|Pathological {{response}} {{can vary}} with the immune status of the host. Infection with B. henselae {{can result in a}} focal suppurative reaction (CSD in immunocompetent patients), a <b>multifocal</b> angioproliferative response (bacillary angiomatosis in immunocompromised patients), endocarditis, or meningitis.|$|E
25|$|Also {{associated}} with a rare but serious risk of <b>multifocal</b> leukoencephalopathy (brain infection leading to death or severe disability). Therefore, a specific program exists in which prescribers must be enrolled, CD-TOUCH (Crohn's Disease-Tysabri Outreach Unified Commitment to Health) Prescribing Program.|$|E
25|$|Progressive <b>multifocal</b> {{leukoencephalopathy}} (PML) is a {{demyelinating disease}} of {{the central nervous system}} that is caused by reactivation of a latent papovavirus (the JC polyomavirus) infection, that can cross the BBB. It affects immune-compromised patients and it is usually seen with patients suffering from AIDS.|$|E
25|$|A full ocular exam {{should be}} {{performed}} for every case of eye pain. Fluoroscein staining is usually diagnostic for corneal ulcers, although staining with Rose Bengal is also recommended as it can pick up early viral/fungal lesions, which will appear as <b>multifocal</b> disturbances to the tear film.|$|E
25|$|<b>Multifocal</b> motor {{neuropathy}} (MMN) {{is a rare}} clinical case, characterized {{almost entirely}} by muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations. An important feature of MMN is that the strength-duration constant is significantly small, corresponding to an appreciable increase in rheobase. Both measurements {{have been shown to}} become normalized following intravenous immunoglobulin therapy.|$|E
25|$|In {{all types}} of surgery, the cataractous lens is removed and {{replaced}} with an artificial lens, known as an intraocular lens, which stays in the eye permanently. Intraocular lenses are usually monofocal, correcting for either distance or near vision. <b>Multifocal</b> lenses may be implanted to improve near and distance vision simultaneously, but these lenses may increase the chance of unsatisfactory vision.|$|E
25|$|Magnetoencephalography (MEG). The <b>multifocal</b> {{nature of}} epileptogenicity in Panayiotopoulos {{syndrome}} has been also documented with MEG, which {{revealed that the}} main epileptogenic areas are along the parietal-occipital, the calcarine, or the central (rolandic) sulci. Patients with frontal spikes were significantly older than patients with spikes on rolandic, parieto-occipital, or calcarine sulci. Follow-up MEG demonstrated shifting localization or disappearance of MEG spikes.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} is more obvious when the epilepsy has frequent and manifold attacks, with the classic {{pattern on the}} electro-encephalogram (EEG); {{the latter is a}} slowed rhythm with Spike-wave-pattern, or with a <b>multifocal</b> and generalizing Sharp-slow-wave-discharges at 1.5–2.5Hz. During sleep, frequently, tonic patterns can be seen. But variations of these patterns are known in patients with no diagnosis other than LGS, and they can differ bilaterally, and from time to time, within the same patient.|$|E
25|$|In Panayiotopoulos {{syndrome}} {{there is}} a diffuse <b>multifocal</b> cortical hyperexcitability, which is age (maturation)-related. This diffuse epileptogenicity may be unequally distributed, predominating in one area, which is often posterior. Epileptic discharges in Panayiotopoulos syndrome, irrespective of their location at onset, activate emetic and autonomic centers prior to any other conventional neocortical seizure manifestations. An explanation {{for this is that}} children are susceptible to autonomic disorders as illustrated by the cyclic vomiting syndrome, which is a nonepileptic condition specific to childhood.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Friday, December 21, 1990, Schmalz had a seizure and collapsed working at his desk at The New York Times. By February, his doctors had determined Schmalz had AIDS. His T cell count was just two and he had progressive <b>multifocal</b> leukoencephalopathy (PML), a brain disease that is often fatal within months. He told his editors about his illness and took a health leave for about seven months. He responded well to AZT and returned to The New York Times just after Labor Day in 1991. He decided to cover the 1992 presidential campaign.|$|E
25|$|Recurrence {{occurs in}} 10 to 20% of patients, but with co-trimoxazole {{eradication}} therapy, {{this can be}} reduced to 4%. While molecular studies have established the majority of recurrences are due to the original infecting strain, a significant proportion of recurrences (perhaps up to a quarter) in endemic areas may be due to reinfection, particularly after two years. Risk factors include severity of disease (patients with positive blood cultures or <b>multifocal</b> disease have a higher risk of relapse), choice of antibiotic for eradication therapy (doxycycline monotherapy and fluoroquinolone therapy are not as effective), poor compliance with eradication therapy and duration of eradication therapy less than 8 weeks.|$|E
25|$|Monovision {{is the use}} of single-vision lenses (one {{focal point}} per lens) to focus an eye (typically the {{dominant}} one) for distance vision and the other for near work. The brain then learns to use this setup to see clearly at all distances. A technique called modified monovision uses <b>multifocal</b> lenses and also specializes one eye for distance and the other for near, thus gaining the benefits of both systems. Alternatively, a person may simply wear reading glasses over their distance contact lenses. Care is advised for persons with a previous history of strabismus and those with significant phorias, who are at risk of eye misalignment under monovision. Studies have shown no adverse effect to driving performance in adapted monovision contact lens wearers.|$|E
25|$|Sheep may be {{infected}} by four recognized species of Sarcocystis: S. arieticanis and S. tenella (S. ovicanis) are pathogenic; S. gigantea (S. ovifelis) and S. medusiformis are non-pathogenic. Infection with these parasites {{is common in}} the US with over 80% of sheep examined showing evidence of infection. S. arieticanis and S. tenella both produce extra intestinal disease. Anemia, anorexia, ataxia, and abortions are the chief clinical signs. Myositis with flaccid paralysis has been reported {{as a consequence of}} infection. Ovine protozoan myeloencephalitis is a recognised syndrome that may occur in outbreaks. The usual pathological findings in such cases are <b>multifocal</b> spinal cord white matter oedema and necrosis, glial nodules and mild to moderate nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis. The diagnosis may be established finding protozoan bodies (12.7-23.0 micrometres) that stain immunocytochemically for Sarcocystis epitopes.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} what causes KLS, but several {{mechanisms}} have been proposed. One possible explanation is hypothalamic or circadian dysfunction. The thalamus probably {{plays a role in}} the out-of-control sleeping, and patients with diencephalic–hypothalamic dysfunction caused by tumors experience symptoms similar to those of KLS patients. Specifically, the medial temporal regions of the thalamus may be involved, although examinations of KLS patients have not consistently found abnormalities in this area. The temporal lobe also appears {{to play a role in}} the condition, possibly causing cognitive difficulties. The apathy and disinhibition found in some KLS sufferers suggest that the condition may include frontal lobe dysfunction as well. The involvement of the thalamus, temporal lobe, and frontal lobe of the brain suggests that there is a <b>multifocal,</b> localized encephalopathy. There are also persistent subclinical abnormalities in KLS sufferers.|$|E

500|$|Maxwell's {{interests}} ranged {{far beyond}} the school syllabus {{and he did not}} pay particular attention to examination performance. He wrote his first scientific paper at the age of 14. In it he described a mechanical means of drawing mathematical curves with a piece of twine, and the properties of ellipses, Cartesian ovals, and related curves with more than two foci. His work [...] "Oval Curves" [...] was presented to the Royal Society of Edinburgh by James Forbes, a professor of natural philosophy at Edinburgh University, but Maxwell was deemed too young to present the work himself. The work was not entirely original, since René Descartes had also examined the properties of such <b>multifocal</b> ellipses in the seventeenth century, but he had simplified their construction.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after its}} {{approval}} natalizumab was {{withdrawn from the}} market by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of the rare but hazardous neurological condition called progressive <b>multifocal</b> leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is an opportunistic infection with neurological progressive symptoms caused by the replication of the JC virus in the glial cells of the brain. All 3 initial cases were taking natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1a. After a safety review the drug was returned to the market in 2006 as a monotherapy for MS under a special prescription program. As of May 2011, over 130 cases of PML had been reported, all [...] in patients who had taken natalizumab {{for more than a}} year. While none of them had taken the drug in combination with other disease-modifying treatments, previous use of MS treatments increases the risk of PML between 3 and 4-fold. The estimated prevalence of PML is 1.5 cases per thousand natalizumab users. Around 20% of MS patients with PML die, while most of the remaining are importantly disabled.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Multifocal</b> electroleucoagulation, {{in which}} white matter is {{gradually}} destroyed by passing electric current through electrodes {{implanted in the}} frontal lobes, was the invention of doctors at the Burden Neurological Institute in 1959. Ten sheaths, each containing six or seven electrodes, were implanted {{in the brain and}} connected to a socket on the head. Every week direct currents of 10–20 mA were passed for about 3 minutes through [...] 2–4 selected electrodes to make electrolytic lesions. These experiments continued throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s. In the mid-1990s there were plans to re-introduce <b>multifocal</b> electrocoagulation but they came to nothing.|$|E
2500|$|Children with Rolandic {{seizures}} {{may develop}} usually mild and reversible linguistic, cognitive and behavioural abnormalities during the active {{phase of the}} disease. These may be worse in children with onset of seizures before 8 years of age, [...] high rate of occurrence and <b>multifocal</b> EEG spikes.|$|E
2500|$|... 5-HT2A {{may be a}} {{necessary}} receptor for clathrin mediated endocytosis of the human polyoma virus called JC virus, the causative agent of progressive <b>multifocal</b> leukoencephalopathy (PML), that enters cells such as oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, B lymphocytes, and kidney epithelial cells. These cells need to express both the alpha 2-6–linked sialic acid component of the 5-HT2A receptor in order to endocytose JCV.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{prostate}} cancer is generally a <b>multifocal</b> disease, the traditional prostatectomy eliminates all local lesions {{by removing the}} entire prostate. However, it has been hypothesized that an [...] "index lesion" [...] might be responsible for disease progression. Therefore, focal therapy targeted towards the index lesion might effectively treat {{prostate cancer}} while preserving {{the remainder of the}} gland. Interventional radiologists have started to treat prostate cancer with minimally invasive therapies such as cryoablation, HIFU, radiofrequency ablation, and photodynamic therapy that permit focal therapy by utilizing image guidance. [...] These therapies are still in beginning or experimental stages; however, because they preserve tissue, they can potentially reduce adverse treatment outcomes such as impotence and incontinence. [...] A small prospective study published in European Urology in February 2015 assessed the focal treatment of index lesions with HIFU in patients with <b>multifocal</b> prostate cancer and found that the majority of men returned to baseline genitourinary function and 86% of men were free of clinically significant prostate cancer at one year. Small, nonrandomized cohort studies with a median range follow-up 17–47 months have shown that cryoablation, HIFU, and phototherapy are associated with low rates of adverse effects and early disease control rates of 83%-100% based on negative biopsies.|$|E
2500|$|Case 5. This case {{involved}} seizures manifesting mainly with syncope-like epileptic seizures without emesis. [...] A 7-year-old boy had from 5 {{years of age}} approximately 12 episodes of collapse at school. All episodes were stereotyped but of variable duration from 2 to 35 minutes. While standing or sitting, he slumped forwards and fell on his desk or the floor and became unresponsive as if in “deep sleep.” There were no convulsions or other discernible ictal or postictal symptoms.Four EEGs consistently showed frequent <b>multifocal</b> spikes predominating in the frontal regions.|$|E
2500|$|EIPH seldom {{causes the}} death of a horse, but if an {{affected}} horse dies and undergoes a post-mortem examination, repeated episodes of EIPH will have caused a characteristic blue-gray-brown staining in the lungs. The staining is due to the presence of hemosiderin. The staining is usually most intense in the dorso-caudal region of the left and right diaphragmatic lobes which often progresses cranioventral with repetitive damage. There are often distinct borders between healthy lung tissue and those parts of the lungs that have been affected by EIPH. [...] Other histopathologic findings include fibrosis, bronchial artery neovascularization, venous remodeling, [...] bronchiolitis, hemosiderin accumulation, increased tissue cellularity (i.e. hemosiderophages), <b>multifocal</b> areas of inflammation, and increased thickness of vascular and airway walls.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, {{two other}} {{recombinant}} medications {{were reported to}} have benefit in moderate to severe Crohn's disease. [...] Certolizumab is a Fab fragment of a humanized anti-TNF alpha monoclonal antibody that is attached to polyethylene glycol to increase its half-life in circulation. [...] It was found to have efficacy over placebo medications for 10 weeks in the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease in one large trial. [...] Natalizumab is an anti-integrin monoclonal antibody that shown utility as induction and maintenance treatment for moderate to severe Crohn's disease. [...] However, it has been associated with progressive <b>multifocal</b> leukoencephalopathy, a usually fatal viral infection of the brain, that may limit its use.|$|E
2500|$|Electroencephalography (EEG). EEG is {{the only}} {{investigation}} with abnormal results, usually showing multiple spikes in various brain locations (Figure). [...] There is marked variability of interictal EEG findings from normal to <b>multifocal</b> spikes that also change significantly in serial EEGs. [...] Occipital spikes are common but not necessary for diagnosis. [...] Frontal or centrotemporal spikes {{may be the only}} abnormality. [...] Generalised discharges may happen alone or together with focal spikes. A few children have consistently normal EEG, including sleep EEG. [...] EEG abnormalities may persist for many years after clinical remission. Conversely, spikes may appear only once in successive EEGs. [...] Series of EEGs of the same child may present with all of the above variations from normal to very abnormal. EEG abnormalities do not appear to determine clinical manifestations, duration, severity, and frequency of seizures or prognosis.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there was}} initial scepticism and {{resistance}} to these findings, including from influential epileptologists because as explained by Ferrie and Livingston:"(a) ictal vomiting had been considered as extremely rare and hitherto had been mainly described in neurosurgical series of adult patients. In children it was generally not considered as having an epileptic origin; (b) autonomic status epilepticus was not recognised as a diagnostic entity; the proposition {{that it might be}} a common occurrence in a benign seizure disorder challenged orthodox concepts of status epilepticus; (c) it implied that paediatricians had been failing to diagnose significant numbers of children with epilepsy, instead erroneously labeling then as having diverse non-epileptic disorders such as encephalitis, syncope, migraine, cyclic vomiting syndrome and gastroenteritis; (d) [...] the characteristic EEG findings suggested alternative diagnoses. Occipital spikes suggested [...] "childhood epilepsy with occipital paroxysms" [...] of Gastaut; <b>multifocal</b> spikes suggested symptomatic epilepsies with poor prognosis.|$|E
