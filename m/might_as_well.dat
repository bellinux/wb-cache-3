5|$|Warning calls {{given by}} birds {{such as the}} Eurasian jay are {{similarly}} honest signals, benefiting both predator and prey: the predator is informed {{that it has been}} detected and <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> save time and energy by giving up the chase, while the prey is protected from attack.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 12, she {{switched}} to golf, sharing her first set of golf clubs with her sister—Annika got the odd numbered clubs and Charlotta the even—and earned her first handicap of 54. She was so shy as a junior she used to deliberately three-putt {{at the end of}} a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech. The coaches noticed and at the next tournament both the winner and the runner-up had to give a speech. Sörenstam decided that if she were going to have to face the crowd anyway she <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> win and the deliberate misses stopped.|$|E

5|$|Plan after plan is thwarted: Elaine tries bribing the maître d'hôtel, but is unsuccessful. They {{contemplate}} {{on getting}} food to go, but they can't eat Chinese {{food in a}} taxicab. Elaine is ravenous, but refuses to eat concession stand food at the movie theater. After missing Tatiana's call, George decides he's {{no longer in the}} mood for the film, Elaine wants to leave and get a hamburger, and Jerry decides that he <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have dinner with his uncle. As soon as they leave, the maître d' calls their party.|$|E
5|$|Later, Walt and Jesse {{dispose of}} Victor's body, the gun that killed Gale, {{and the box}} cutter in a barrel of {{hydrofluoric}} acid. During breakfast later, Walt insists to Jesse that Gale's death was necessary, but expresses concern that Gus will kill them at his next opportunity. Jesse doubts this, believing {{it will be too}} much trouble for Gus to find another drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus understand the situation: neither can kill the other, so Gus <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> make them wish they were dead. The episode ends with police investigating Gale's apartment with the camera focusing on his lab notes which have yet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|The balloon {{had carried}} {{a lot of}} food, of a kind adapted more for a balloon voyage than for travels on foot. Andrée had {{reasoned}} that they <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> throw excess food overboard as sand, if losing weight was necessary; {{and if it was}} not, the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did after all become necessary. There was therefore less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, 767kg (1690lb) altogether, including 200liters of water and some crates of champagne, port, beer, etc., donated by sponsors and manufacturers. There was also lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of pemmican, meat, sausages, cheese, and condensed milk. By the time they crashed, they had thrown some of it overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than 200kg (440lb). This was not realistic, as it broke the sleds and wore out the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential equipment, bringing the loads down to 130kg per sled. It became more necessary than ever to hunt for food. They shot and ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.|$|E

5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga, Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that {{were easy to}} read, {{something}} {{she felt she was}} unable to do well when the manga's serialization began. What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible. When developing the characters, she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends she had in the drama club when she was a student. However, Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair, side pigtails, and him being forced to cross-dress. When developing the members of the public morals committee, Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross-dressing brothers, which led to Kaguya's development. Tsukudani's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto+, and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner, so she created No. 1 and thought she <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> make her into a cross-dressing girl. For Mitsunaga and Hiro, she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue. Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them, including what hair color they would have.|$|E
