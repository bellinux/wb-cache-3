5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} extreme {{examples}} of colonial behavior in rodents are the eusocial naked <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> and Damaraland <b>mole</b> <b>rat.</b> The naked <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> lives completely underground and can form colonies of up to 80 individuals. Only one female and up to three males in the colony reproduce, {{while the rest of}} the members are smaller and sterile, and function as workers. Some individuals are of intermediate size. They help with the rearing of the young and can take the place of a reproductive if one dies. The Damaraland <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> is characterized by having a single reproductively active male and female in a colony where the remaining animals are not truly sterile, but become fertile only if they establish a colony of their own.|$|E

5|$|Footdrumming is used widely as a {{predator}} warning or defensive action. It is used primarily by fossorial or semi-fossorial rodents. The banner-tailed kangaroo rat produces several complex footdrumming patterns {{in a number}} of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake. The footdrumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit. Several studies have indicated intentional use of ground vibrations as a means of intra-specific communication during courtship among the Cape <b>mole</b> <b>rat.</b> Footdrumming has been reported to be involved in male-male competition; the dominant male indicates its resource holding potential by drumming, thus minimizing physical contact with potential rivals.|$|E

40|$|Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV 1) {{is widely}} used as a gene {{delivery}} vector {{in a variety of}} laboratory animals. In a recent study, a thymidine-kinase–inactive (replication-conditional) HSV 1 used as a delivery vector was lethal in naked <b>mole</b> <b>rats,</b> whereas mice infected with the identical virus showed no adverse effects. This result prompted us to undertake a controlled comparative histologic study of the effect of HSV 1 infection on naked <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> and mice. Replication-competent and replication-conditional HSV 1 caused widespread inflammation and necrosis in multiple organ systems of naked <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> but not mice; naked <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> infected with replication-defective virus showed no adverse effects. We conclude that the lethality of HSV 1 for naked <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> is likely the result of overwhelming infection, possibly in part due to this species’ natural lack of proinflammatory neuropeptides at the initial site of infection...|$|R
25|$|In blind <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> (genus Spalax), {{the process}} of {{necrosis}} replaces {{the role of the}} systematic apoptosis normally used in many organisms. Low oxygen conditions, such as those common in blind mole rats' burrows, usually cause cells to undergo apoptosis. In adaptation to higher tendency of cell death, blind <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> evolved a mutation in the tumor suppressor protein p53 (which is also used in humans) to prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis. Human cancer patients have similar mutations, and blind <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> were thought to be more susceptible to cancer because their cells cannot undergo apoptosis. However, after a specific amount of time (within 3 days according to a study conducted at the University of Rochester), the cells in blind <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> release interferon-beta (which the immune system normally uses to counter viruses) in response to over-proliferation of cells caused by the suppression of apoptosis. In this case, the interferon-beta triggers cells to undergo necrosis, and this mechanism also kills cancer cells in blind <b>mole</b> <b>rats.</b> Because of tumor suppression mechanisms such as this, blind <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> and other spalacids are resistant to cancer.|$|R
5|$|Kim Possible is an American {{animated}} action comedy-adventure {{television series}} created by Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle that originally aired on Disney Channel from June 7, 2002 to September 7, 2007. The show revolves around eponymous {{high school student}} Kim Possible, a teenager tasked with fighting crime {{on a regular basis}} while coping with everyday issues commonly associated with adolescence. Kim is aided by her clumsy best friend and sidekick Ron Stoppable, his pet naked <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> Rufus and 10 year-old computer genius Wade. Known collectively as Team Possible, the majority of Kim and Ron's missions require them to thwart the evil plans of mad scientist–supervillain duo Dr. Drakken and his sidekick Shego, but they occasionally encounter other enemies as well.|$|E
5|$|Kim Possible {{takes place}} {{primarily}} within the fictional United States town of Middleton, {{and focuses on}} the life and adventures of teenager Kim Possible. She is an accomplished high school student and cheerleader who fights crime on a regular basis, assisted by her best friend and sidekick, Ron Stoppable, and Rufus, his pet naked <b>mole</b> <b>rat.</b> Ron's personal fears, insecurities and clumsiness sometimes {{have a tendency to}} jeopardize the success of their own missions. Kim and Ron are aided remotely by Wade, a 10 year-old computer genius who seldom leaves his bedroom and communicates with the duo via device he invented himself known as a Kimmunicator. Together, the foursome is known as Team Possible. The majority of Kim's missions involve her traveling to various destinations around the world to rescue citizens from harm and battle a variety of enemies and villains, the most frequent of whom are Dr. Drakken, a mad scientist constantly plotting world domination, and his superpowered sidekick Shego, who possesses the ability to generate powerful energy blasts and emit them from her hands, making her the heroine's most dangerous opponent. Not yet of age to drive herself to most of her missions, Kim often relies on favors from various people and friends she has assisted in the past for transportation.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are used}} widely as model organisms in animal testing. Albino mutant rats were first used for {{research}} in 1828 and later became the first animal domesticated for purely scientific purposes. Nowadays, the house mouse is {{the most commonly used}} laboratory rodent, and in 1979 it was estimated that fifty million were used annually worldwide. They are favored because of their small size, fertility, short gestation period and ease of handling and because they are susceptible to many of the conditions and infections that afflict humans. They are used in research into genetics, developmental biology, cell biology, oncology and immunology. Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the late 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the United States {{for research in}} the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. In 2007, they constituted about 2% of all laboratory animals. Guinea pigs {{played a major role in}} the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, Émile Roux, and Robert Koch. They have been launched into orbital space flight several times—first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961, with a successful recovery. The naked <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> is the only known mammal that is poikilothermic; it is used in studies on thermoregulation. It is also unusual in not producing the neurotransmitter substance P, a fact which researchers find useful in studies on pain.|$|E

25|$|Several special filming {{techniques}} were devised to obtain {{some of the}} footage of rare and elusive animals. One cameraman spent hundreds of hours waiting for the fleeting moment when a rare frog, which incubates its young in its mouth, finally spat them out. Another built a replica of a <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> burrow in a horizontally mounted wheel, so that as the <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> ran along the tunnel, the wheel could be spun to keep the animal adjacent to the camera.

25|$|Three morphotypes of cecal-appendices can be {{described}} among mammals based primarily on {{the shape of the}} cecum: a distinct appendix branching from a rounded or sac-like cecum (as in many primate species), an appendix located at the apex of a long and voluminous cecum (as in the rabbit, greater glider and Cape dune <b>mole</b> <b>rat),</b> and an appendix {{in the absence of a}} pronounced cecum (as in the wombat). In addition, long narrow appendix-like structures are found in mammals that either lack an apparent cecum (as in monotremes) or lack a distinct junction between the cecum and appendix-like structure (as in the koala). A cecal appendix has evolved independently at least twice, and apparently represents yet another example of convergence in morphology between Australian marsupials and placentals in the rest of the world. Although the appendix has apparently been lost by numerous species, it has also been maintained for more than 80 million years in at least one clade.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristic}} of <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> ecological niche {{has been made}} on the basis of the data of earth remote sensing. With the help of the ecological niche factor analysis it was established, that integrity of a cover of steppe vegetation and an abundance of phytomass promote active development of <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> populations. Also the attention is paid to such feature, that the ecological conditionality of the specialization of <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> digging activity depends on time of the year: the indices are grouped according the month attribute, when the picture has been made. It should be noted that the ecological niche of <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> is conjugated with steppe vegetation that is characterized by considerable seasonal variation of structure, abundance, and habit. This is why the description of ecological niche of <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> as the component of steppe environment in terms of digital image could be done as combination of seasonal features, rather than relative constant image during vegetation period. Relief patterns as the factor determining the ecological niche refract through its influence on phytomass and steppe vegetation dynamics.

The optimum area for this species has been displaced on slopes of beams and bayracks that are unsuitable for human economic activity...|$|R

500|$|In {{the days}} leading up to Kim Possibles premiere, {{television}} critics speculated whether or not the show will attract a prominent male audience large enough to be successful despite its female lead, attributing failure to achieve this with the cancellation of the female-led animated series Madeline.

The series continued to garner critical acclaim throughout its run, earning significant praise for its dialogue, animation and characters. Describing the show as [...] "infectious", Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote, [...] "Blessed with a modern sense of humor and hip -- but not too hip -- vocabulary, Kim Possible should appeal to the tweens (ages 9-13) it clearly targets", while dubbing Rufus the series' breakout star.
