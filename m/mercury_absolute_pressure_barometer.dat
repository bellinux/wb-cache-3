40|$|Data for a liquid-cooled engine with a {{displacement}} volume of 1710 cubic inches were analyzed {{to determine the}} effect of exhaust pressure on the engine cooling characteristics. The data covered a range of exhaust pressures from 7 to 62 inches of <b>mercury</b> <b>absolute,</b> inlet-manifold <b>pressures</b> from 30 to 50 inches of <b>mercury</b> <b>absolute,</b> engine speeds from 1600 to 3000 rpm, and fuel-air ratios from 0. 063 to 0. 100. The effect of exhaust pressure on engine cooling was satisfactorily incorporated in the NACA cooling-correlation method as a variation in effective gas temperature with exhaust pressure. Large variations of cylinder-head temperature with exhaust pressure were obtained for operation at constant charge flow. At a constant charge flow of 2 pounds per second (approximately 1000 bhp) and a fuel-air ratio of 0. 085, an increase in exhaust pressure from 10 to 60 inches of <b>mercury</b> <b>absolute</b> resulted in an increase of 40 F in average cylinder-head temperature. For operation at constant engine speed and inlet-manifold pressure and variable exhaust pressure (variable charge flow), however, the effect of exhaust pressure on cylinder-head temperature is small. For example, at an inlet-manifold pressure of 40 inches of <b>mercury</b> <b>absolute,</b> an engine speed of 2400 rpm. - and a fuel-air ratio of 0. 085, the average cylinder-head temperature was about the same at exhaust pressures of 10 and 60 inches of,mercury absolute; a rise and a subsequent decrease of about 70 occurred between these extremes...|$|R

Engine vacuum is a [...] "gauge" [...] pressure, since gauges by nature measure a pressure difference, not an <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure.</b> The engine fundamentally responds to air mass, not vacuum, and <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> is necessary to calculate mass.

50|$|MAP sensors measure <b>absolute</b> <b>{{pressure}}.</b> Boost sensors or gauges {{measure the}} amount of pressure above a set <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure.</b> That set <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> is usually 100 kPa. This is {{commonly referred to as}} gauge pressure. Boost pressure is relative to <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> - as one increases or decreases, so does the other. It is a one-to-one relationship with an offset of -100 kPa for boost pressure. Thus a MaP sensor will always read 100 kPa more than a boost sensor measuring the same conditions. A MaP sensor will never display a negative reading because it is measuring <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure,</b> where zero is the total absence of pressure. Vacuum is measured as a negative pressure relative to normal atmospheric pressure. Vacuum-Boost sensors can display negative readings, indicating vacuum or suction (a condition of lower pressure than the surrounding atmosphere). In forced induction engines (supercharged or turbocharged), a negative boost reading indicates that the engine is drawing air faster than it is being supplied, creating suction. The suction is caused by throttling in spark ignition engines and is not present in diesel engines. This is often called vacuum pressure when referring to internal combustion engines.|$|R

With increasing the radiation power, reducing the <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> (acts of vacuum) in the dryer chamber and also reducing the thickness of potato slices, drying time and the amount of energy consumed is reduced.
