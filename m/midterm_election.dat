5|$|Nixon {{was one of}} the few leading Republicans not {{blamed for}} the {{disastrous}} results, and he sought to build on that in the 1966 congressional elections. He campaigned for many Republicans seeking to regain seats lost in the Johnson landslide and received credit for helping the Republicans make major gains in the <b>midterm</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ohio statewide {{offices are}} {{regularly}} contested {{every four years}} in the <b>midterm</b> <b>election</b> years. 2008 is Class 2 senatorial election year, and Ohio is a state with class 1 and class 3 senators. Thus, the Attorney General race was the only non-presidential race in the 2008 election aside from contests for two seats on the Ohio Supreme Court. Cordray defeated Republican Mike Crites, 57%-38%.|$|E
5|$|Clark campaigned heavily {{throughout}} the 2006 <b>midterm</b> <b>election</b> campaign, supporting numerous Democrats {{in a variety}} of federal, statewide, and state legislature campaigns. Ultimately his PAC aided 42 Democratic candidates who won their elections, including 25 who won seats formerly held by Republicans and 6 newly elected veteran members of the House and Senate. Clark was the most-requested surrogate of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee {{throughout the}} 2006 campaign, and sometimes appeared with the leadership of the Democratic Party when they commented on security issues.|$|E

50|$|<b>Midterm</b> <b>elections</b> usually {{generate}} lower {{voter turnout}} than presidential elections. While the latter have had turnouts of about 50-60% {{over the past}} 60 years, only about 40 percent of those eligible to vote actually {{go to the polls}} in <b>midterm</b> <b>elections.</b> <b>Midterm</b> <b>elections</b> usually see the president's party lose seats in Congress, and also frequently see the president's intraparty opponents gain power.|$|R
5|$|During the 1910 <b>midterm</b> <b>election</b> campaign, Roosevelt {{involved}} {{himself in}} New York politics, while Taft with donations and influence tried {{to secure the}} election of the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Ohio, former lieutenant governor Warren G. Harding. The Republicans suffered losses in the 1910 elections as the Democrats took control of the House and slashed the Republican majority in the Senate. In New Jersey, Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected governor, and Harding lost his race in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The PJ won the 2001 <b>midterm</b> <b>election</b> by 40% to 24%, {{giving it}} a {{majority}} in both chambers of the Congress. However, the abstention rate and several forms of protest votes combined reached 41%, the highest in Argentine history, {{as a consequence of}} the popular discontent with the two main parties. Even the few candidates of the Alliance who won at their districts, such as the radical Rodolfo Terragno in Buenos Aires, did so with political platforms against De la Rúa's administration.|$|E
5|$|The state's U.S. Senate seats have {{generally}} been split since the early 1990s, and in the 108th and 109th Congresses, Minnesota's congressional delegation was split, with four representatives and one senator from each party. In the 2006 <b>midterm</b> <b>election,</b> Democrats were elected to all state offices except for governor and lieutenant governor, where Republicans Tim Pawlenty and Carol Molnau narrowly won reelection. The DFL posted double-digit gains {{in both houses of}} the legislature, elected Amy Klobuchar to the U.S. Senate, and increased the party's U.S. House caucus by one. Keith Ellison (DFL) was elected as the first African American U.S. Representative from Minnesota, as well as the first Muslim elected to Congress nationwide. In 2008, DFLer and former comedian and radio talk show host Al Franken beat incumbent Republican Norm Coleman in the United States Senate race by 312 votes out of 3 million cast.|$|E

25|$|On February 15, 2010, Bayh {{announced}} he would not seek reelection to a third Senate term in the November 2, 2010 <b>midterm</b> <b>election.</b> Bayh's announcement came very shortly after former Senator Dan Coats declared his own candidacy for Bayh's Senate seat. Because he made his announcement {{the day before the}} deadline for filing for the primary, no Democrat was able to gather a sufficient number of signatures to qualify for the primary ballot, so the state party committee chose Congressman Brad Ellsworth as the nominee.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 United States Senate {{election}} in Connecticut was a <b>midterm</b> <b>election</b> {{which took place}} on November 2, 2010 to decide a Class III Senator from the State of Connecticut to join the 112th United States Congress. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd suffered from dropping approval ratings {{in the past few}} years due to major controversies, leading him to announce in January 2010 that he would retire, instead of seeking a sixth term. As Dodd was a Democrat, Richard Blumenthal, incumbent State Attorney General, announced on the same day that he would run for Dodd’s seat. The Connecticut Democratic Party nominated Blumenthal on May 21. Businesswoman Linda McMahon won the state party's nominating convention and the August 10 Republican primary to become the Republican candidate.|$|E
25|$|DeLay {{began his}} career as a {{politician}} in 1978 when he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives. In 1985, he became a born-again Christian. In 1988, after just a few years in the U.S. House, Tom DeLay was appointed Deputy Minority Whip. In 1994 he helped Newt Gingrich orchestrate the Republican Revolution, which gave the Republicans the victory in the 1994 <b>midterm</b> <b>election</b> and swept Democrats from power in both houses of Congress, putting Republicans in control of the House of Representatives for the first time in forty years. In 1995, he was elected House Majority Whip. With the Republicans in control of both chambers in Congress, DeLay, along with Gingrich and conservative activist Grover Norquist, helped start the K Street Project, an effort to advance Republican ideals. DeLay was elected House Majority Leader after the 2002 midterm elections. On policy issues, DeLay was known as a strong conservative during his years in Congress.|$|E

25|$|The Republican administrations of President Richard Nixon (1969–74) and Gerald Ford (1974–77) were {{characterized}} by their emphasis on détente and on economic intervention through wage and price controls. Ford angered conservatives by continuing Henry Kissinger as Secretary of State and pushing his policy of détente with the Soviet Union. Conservatives finally found a new champion in Ronald Reagan, whose 8 years as governor of California had just ended in 1976, and supported his campaign for the Republican nomination. Ford narrowly won renomination but lost the White House. Following major gains by Democratic liberals in the 1974 <b>midterm</b> <b>election,</b> Jimmy Carter was elected as President. Carter proved too liberal for his fellow Southern Baptists, (as they voted for him in 1976 but not 1980), too conservative for the mainstream of the Democratic Party, and many considered his foreign policy a failure. Carter realized {{there was a strong}} national sense of malaise, as inflation skyrocketed, interest rates soared, the economy stagnated, and prolonged humiliation resulted when Islamic militants in Tehran kept American diplomats hostage for 444 days in 1979–81.|$|E
500|$|In the November 1994 elections, Republicans gained 54 {{seats and}} {{took control of}} the House {{for the first time since}} 1954. Long-time House Minority Leader Bob Michel of Illinois had not run for re-election, giving Gingrich, the highest-ranking Republican {{returning}} to Congress, the inside track at becoming Speaker. The <b>midterm</b> <b>election</b> that turned congressional power over to Republicans [...] "changed the center of gravity" [...] in the nation's capital.
