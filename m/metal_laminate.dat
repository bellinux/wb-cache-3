50|$|While {{most of the}} {{fuselage}} is made of aluminium alloys, composite materials comprise more than 20% of the A380's airframe. Carbon-fibre reinforced plastic, glass-fibre reinforced plastic and quartz-fibre reinforced plastic are used extensively in wings, fuselage sections (such as the undercarriage and rear end of fuselage), tail surfaces, and doors. The A380 is the first commercial airliner to have a central wing box made of carbon fibre reinforced plastic. It is also the first to have a smoothly contoured wing cross section. The wings of other commercial airliners are partitioned span-wise into sections. This flowing continuous cross section reduces aerodynamic drag. Thermoplastics {{are used in the}} leading edges of the slats. The hybrid fibre <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> material GLARE (glass laminate aluminium reinforced epoxy) is used in the upper fuselage and on the stabilisers' leading edges. This aluminium-glass-fibre laminate is lighter and has better corrosion and impact resistance than conventional aluminium alloys used in aviation. Unlike earlier composite materials, GLARE can be repaired using conventional aluminium repair techniques. The application of GLARE on the A380 has a long history, which shows the complex nature of innovations in the aircraft industry.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{failure of}} fibre metal {{laminates}} was investigated experimentally. A projectile of hemispherical {{head with a}} diameter of 36. 5 mm was used to impact the fibre <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> panels. Three types of woven fibre fabrics (Basalt, S 2 -glass and Kevlar- 29) were used to reinforce the aluminum sheets.

Different deformation/failure modes of fibre metal laminates were obtained by varying the impact energy.

40|$|Cold {{expansion}} {{has proven}} to be an effective technique for extending the fatigue life of monolithic materials. Although fiber <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> materials show improved fatigue performance compared to their monolithic counterparts, the nucleation and growth of small cracks tends to occur early on in the fatigue life of the material, making acceptance of fiber metal laminates in aerospace more difficult. This work examined whether cold expansion could delay this process in fiber metal laminates and increase the fatigue life of these materials at the same time. The results showed that significant differences existed in the residual strain field between the mandrel exit and entry faces resulting in slower fatigue crack growth on the exit face, which also had higher residual strains in the region surrounding the cold expanded hole. Overall, cold expansion is effective at increasing the fatigue life of fiber <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> materials, but is less effective at delaying nucleation and growth of small cracks on the entry face.

The test was conducted under two side clamped conditions in order to study the fiber orientation effect.
