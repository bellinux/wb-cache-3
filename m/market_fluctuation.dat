A spokesman for Harper later reported that Harper would not call such a meeting, and to save discussion for the Leader's Debate, as [...] " [...] will have an opportunity later this week to debate— not behind closed doors but in front of all Canadians— the issues at stake not [...] for our economy but for our country". Harper later announced that he would ask for the 12 minutes on the economy scheduled for the Leader's Debate to be extended to an hour, citing that the financial crisis affecting the U.S. [...] "has deepened since the debate format was finalized", a change which would require agreement from the other parties in the debate to be approved. The NDP released a statement soon after that they supported the move, while public response has been concerned that other topics such as the environment would not end up with enough time to cover the issue. All the leaders supported the idea, and the opening and closing statements were dropped and the allotted time for the economy extended to 30 minutes without affecting the other topics.|$|E

50|$|Disintermediation in Banking and Finance is most {{directly}} {{attributed to the}} massive movements of funds away from Bank investments in the 20th century, due to the Banking Act of 1933 and the Banking Act of 1935, which involved {{the formation of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Company. The FDIC is responsible for insuring deposits at banks, and it was created with the purpose of regaining general confidence in the Banking System amidst the great depression and the major banking crises that came with it. This type of depository insurance {{at the time of its}} creation (following the collapse of several major banks) is the kind of security that is sought after in an investment and in turn this insurance is one of the key factors in the reintermediation of savings into federally insured depositories. Reintermediation is mainly caused by the desire to insure savings into a secure account and in times of <b>market</b> <b>fluctuation</b> and interest rate volatility in the money market the funds will naturally flow back into savings deposits.|$|E
50|$|Sale & Purchase ("S&P") brokers {{handle the}} {{buying and selling}} of {{existing}} vessels in the secondhand market or contract new ships (called newbuildings in industry parlance) from shipbuilding yards. S&P brokers promote opportunities and discuss market trends with shipowners, charterers, investors and bankers, as well as reporting on market sales, vessel values, market trends and activity. When a shipowner has a vessel to sell or {{is looking for a}} vessel to acquire, the shipbroker will scour the market for buyers, or for suitable sales candidates, discuss with potential counterparties or their broker the main points of the sale transaction and eventually negotiate all of the details, usually based on a standard contract. During such proceedings, shipbrokers not only negotiate the price of the vessel on behalf of their principals but also all the logistical details for the transfer of the title and the vessel itself to the buyers (new owners), including the banking arrangements. During any negotiation minor disputes may occur which are to be handled in accordance with <b>market</b> <b>fluctuation,</b> i.e. the market may be moving in favor of the buyer (vessel price is softening) or in favor of the seller (vessel price is strengthening) giving each party a potential reason to cancel the transaction. When shipbrokers act on behalf of passive investors or financial buyers, they may also have to find time charter employment for the vessel and assist with practical arrangements such as the appointment of ship managers. Some S&P brokers specialize in the sale of ships for scrap, requiring a different set of skills and contacts.|$|E

Thus, questions arise that whether the stock market movements are affected due to politics? Due to inflation? Due to interest rate? Due to exchange rate? Due to GDP? or due to GNP?

40|$|Between {{suppliers}} and manufacturers, {{there exists a}} market demand which is subject to <b>market</b> <b>fluctuation</b> {{and can not be}} precisely forecasted. Under this background, the study aims at the research on the adoption of scientific methods to reduce the impact of <b>market</b> <b>fluctuation</b> upon both sides of supply and demand. In this article, the author solves the problem from two aspects. Firstly, the Grey System Model is applied to precisely predict the market demand. Secondly, a third party warehouse between {{suppliers and}} manufacturers is established to adjust the contradiction between supply and demand. Furthermore, through case verification, it is found that the time of material supply will be decreased from 100 days to about 38 days and the stock value is correspondingly reduced. Therefore, the author suggests that the Grey System Theory should be utilized by suppliers to optimize their approaches of forecasting the market trends and manufacturers’ requiring quantities...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} dealing with the {{controversial}} question of the potential impact of stock <b>market</b> <b>fluctuations</b> on consumer confidence. In the last few years, this confidence index has gained importance in business cycle analysis and empirical evidence has shown its explanatory power in forecasting consumption along with standard macroeconomic variables. Meanwhile, numerous interpretations of its fluctuations arose, and few were based on a solid argumentation. Therefore, we propose in this paper to determine which elements are actually driving the confidence index. Using the standard error-correction mechanism model and non-linear methods, we analyze the relationship between the confidence index and several economic variables, over the period ranging from January 1983 to December 2001. As a growing number of economic observers claim the stock <b>market</b> <b>fluctuations</b> have a strong impact on consumer confidence, we especially focus on this potential impact. The models are estimated for the United States and for Belgium for which the importance of equities in the households net wealth is quite different. We find in particular that stock <b>market</b> <b>fluctuations</b> have explanatory power in the evolution of consumer confidence in the United States, especially {{since the beginning of the}} nineties. consumer conﬁdence, business cycles, consumer surveys, stock prices...|$|R
