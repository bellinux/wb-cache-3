40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The global growth of <b>sport</b> and <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> as tourism and mass entertainment in both single and multi sport formats has prompted the desire for {{a greater understanding of}} event attendees and the implications of their motivations and decisions to travel and attend <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>events.</b> However, research into <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> has generally focused on the Olympic Games and/or attendance of a single <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event.</b> Currently, the <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> community sees the value of measuring the economic impact of <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> but do not understand the decisions taken by individuals that travel to and attend <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> {{due to the lack of}} research in the area. Thus, more robust and comprehensive research needs to be carried out to improve the understanding of individuals that travel to and attend a range of <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>events.</b> The purpose of this research was to develop a better understanding of the total spend and trip duration decisions of individuals that travel to and attend <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> with commercial companies. The research used a positivist quantitative strategy to empirically assess research questions surrounding repeat <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> attendance, motivations for <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> attendance, variables affecting total spending and trip duration decisions and relationships the between motivations, trip duration and total spending, and to econometrically model findings. Independent variables for analysis were identified through a review of literature, which informed the construction of both a conceptual model and online survey focusing on demographics, <b>event</b> related motivations, <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> profile and <b>sporting</b> involvement. Variable-based data collected from individual respondents on nine different <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> then underwent a two stage descriptive and statistical analysis. The descriptive analysis consisted of a quantitative breakdown of survey results and the statistical analysis allowed the data to be econometrically modeled and assessed through regression analysis. The research provided significant findings towards understanding the decisions taken by individuals that travel to and attend <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> and in doing so led to a greater understanding of total spend and trip duration decisions. Findings indicated that the demographic variables and event related motivations determined total spend decisions whilst demographic variables, event related motivations and <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> profile variables determined trip duration decisions.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{economic}} impact assessment of six <b>major</b> <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> held in the UK in 1997. <b>Major</b> <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> are now regarded by many cities as a significant part of their tourism strategy. However, staging a <b>major</b> <b>sports</b> <b>event</b> normally involves the host city making a contribution to the costs. Whether such a contribution is justified depends on the economic benefits generated in the local economy. The results reported in this paper indicate the wide variability in such benefits as well as the difficulty sometimes encountered in predicting what these benefits will be prior to the staging of the event.

The Tribune called it the [...] "Game of the Century", and 55 newspapers across the country printed the fans' ballots in their papers. The Tribune estimated the game's attendance on July 6, 1933, at 49,000. The proceeds ($45,000, net gate receipts) from the game went to a charity for disabled and needy major league players.

40|$|In 1990 Toffler {{coined the}} term “pulsating organization” to reflect {{organizations}} that expand and contract. This term has relevance for <b>major</b> <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> organizations. They generally operate with a small core of personnel {{for much of the}} year, expand substantially in the lead up to an event, then afterwards personnel numbers shrink in size. This effect poses substantial challenges in delivering a quality induction process for many <b>major</b> <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> organizations. The first part of this study identifies how these “pulsating organizations,” in light of their special characteristics, have adapted an induction process from “generic” organizations. The second part incorporates semistructured interviews with managers at the Australian Open Tennis Championships and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix to ascertain their induction process before a <b>major</b> <b>sport</b> <b>event.</b> The final part recommends a model to improve the management of induction at these two organizations. On a broader scale, managers of other pulsating <b>major</b> <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> organizations could incorporate this model, when developing, implementing, and evaluating their induction process.

40|$|This {{research}} studies two <b>major</b> <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> organizations and explores the specialized approaches used to retain personnel {{for the purpose}} of a <b>major</b> <b>sport</b> <b>event.</b> The analysis was based on data obtained from semistructured interviews with managers at the Australian Open Tennis Championships (AOTC) and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix (AFOGP). Analysis of the data revealed that {{due to the nature of}} these events, a customized retention process for various personnel categories during the different stages of an event cycle was appropriate. Of particular concern was the need for tailored retention strategies for full-time personnel in the first couple of months after an event, and for seasonal personnel in between events. Consequently, modifications to the generic retention management practices were suggested, in order to cater for the special demands of major sport events. Strategies were developed from these research findings that should improve the management of personnel retention at the AOTC and AFOGP. The strategies build upon the present body of literature in this field, and should have application in other <b>major</b> <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> organization...|$|E

40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen {{unprecedented}} demand to host major sport events, since they can potentially fulfil multi-levelled economic, social, and political agendas. However, despite their universal appeal and {{long history of}} implementation, the emergent industry is too often associated with examples of mismanagement. In the light of these continuing <b>major</b> <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management incidents, {{the purpose of this}} study is to provide a review of current management practice and to place this in some sense of temporal context by reflecting on the historical as well future development of the evolving industry. Adopting a practitioner focus at the local organising committee level, a self-administered postal questionnaire was sent to 178 <b>major</b> <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> organisers from 11 countries. Based upon a stratified sample of the 20 priority sports of England, the most senior manager of these sport governing bodies and local authority hosts was invited to participate in the study. Providing a questionnaire response rate of 26 % a second phase of data collection was undertaken. This entailed 10 in-depth face-to-face semi-structured interviews selected on the basis of a geographical convenience sample (50 Â mile radius of author) of returned questionnaire respondents. The findings reveal that current success is based upon effective and efficient management of the tripartite relationship of sport, media, and the event funders, as well as limiting chance occurrences. Reflecting on the historical and future drivers of the event industry, it was further concluded that a better understanding of economics, technology and culture are fundamental to ensuing a safer and new era of global professionalism. <b>Major</b> <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> Event management Practitioner...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of public}} funds to host major sport events is a {{contentious}} issue that all major cities face. It is expensive to host a <b>major</b> <b>sport</b> <b>event,</b> and the benefits, or lack of, associated with hosting have been widely researched and reported (Kim, Jun, Walker & Drane, 2015; Kim & Petrick, 2005; Ochman, 2013). Therefore, the decision on whether a city should bid to host a <b>major</b> <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> is of critical importance for both the cities elected officials, event owners and organisers, {{as well as the}} local community. Community support is considered an essential part of planning an operating a successful event. The perceived social, economic and environmental impact of hosting a <b>major</b> <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> on the local community is commonly used as a method to understand community support for an event. In addition, it is becoming increasingly common for cities to hold a referendum as a method to gauge community support for a <b>major</b> <b>sport</b> <b>event,</b> and as a result decide if the city should submit a bid to host. Competition between major cities for hosting major sport events is becoming increasingly strong. However, Auckland is known as a desirable location to host such events, having recently hosted successfully the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and the FIFA U- 20 World Cup and Cricket World Cup in 2015. The possibility of Auckland hosting a future Commonwealth Games provides an ideal context to investigate factors affecting community support for the event, and local resident interest in an eventrelated referendum. A mixed-method approach will be taken to achieve the study’s purpose. The quantitative phase of the research will be a cross-sectional study of local residents in Auckland. To make the results relevant to real world decisions, a representative sample of participants will be surveyed through the use of online market research panels. This phase would measure the perceived social, environmental and economic impact of a future Auckland Commonwealth Games. In addition, this phase would also ask local residents three key questions: 1) Should there be a referendum?, 2) Would you participate in the referendum?, 3) How would you vote in the referendum? Scales with established validity and reliability will underpin the survey. The survey will be designed {{so that it can be}} easily replicated in future years to determine if support is changing or applied to other events or stadium developments. The qualitative phase of the research will be semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders that would be involved in a bid to host the Commonwealth Games in Auckland. Interview questions will be formulated based on the results from the crosssectional study of local residents. Data from the interviews will be analysed using thematic analysis...|$|E
