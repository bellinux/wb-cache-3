The domain in which these algorithms operate, i. e., modal or phase, determines their performance in fault discrimination, fault type classification and faulted pole selection. In the recent literature, high-speed algorithms have been proposed for various VSC HVDC grid configurations and transmission line types; yet the choice of domain has received insufficient attention. This paper offers recommendations for the choice of domain for protection algorithm design of HVDC overhead line or cable systems in symmetric monopolar and bipolar configurations. The theoretical analysis of this paper, {{which is based on}} fundamental wave propagation theory, indicates that the most computationally efficient domain for protection algorithms for cable and overhead line systems are the phase and modal, respectively.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: Energy {{turnaround}} {{from conventional}} to renewable energy generation needs bulk power long distance transmission. This new transmission objective can be meet with an HVDC overlay grid spanning the existing AC transmission system. This thesis proposes an operation management strategy for future HVDC overlay grids subdivided in tertiary, secondary and primary control instances. The tertiary control ensures coordination among HVDC converters {{and with the}} AC system. It determines converter reference values on a regular basis. It is proposed for the case of having multiple {{as well as a}} single system operator responsible for the overlay HVDC grid. The secondary control instance locally adapts tertiary control’s converter references to the actual grid requirements (e. g. after disturbances). The primary control ensures DC energy balance. Therefore, a continuous p-v -characteristic is proposed as well as two appropriate parameterization methods. One emulates piecewise linear p-v -characteristics and the other performs an automatic parameterization according to available balancing power provision capabilities on related AC point of common coupling.

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} achieve {{lightning}} protection and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements, a proper grounding system is needed. Furthermore, the Earth Surface Potential (ESP) due to discharging current into grounding system in case of abnormal conditions has to be known. The Main objectives of the grounding system are, I) 	To guarantee {{the integrity of the}} equipments and continuity of the service under the fault conditions (providing means to carry and dissipate electrical currents into ground). II) 	To safeguard those people that working or walking in the surroundings of the grounded installations are not exposed to dangerous electrical shocks. To attain these targets, the equivalent electrical grounding resistance (Rg) of the system must be low enough to assure that fault currents dissipate mainly through the grounding grid into the earth, while maximum potential difference between close points into the earth’s surface must be kept under certain tolerances (step, touch, and <b>mesh</b> <b>voltages).</b> A lot of efforts had been taken to answer the very important question, which is, how the Earth Surface Potential due to discharging current into grounding system can be calculated. Many researches are published to present information about step and touch voltages, some of these publications depend on the experimental works on a scale model and the other depend on some empirical function that depend also on the results from experimental. Scale model in an electrolytic tank to simulate the lightning events on earth is presented to measure the Earth Surface Potential (ESP) {{on the surface of the}} water and also to study the transient performance of the grounding grid when it subjects to lightning like (Impulse current), in order to know something about the behaviour of the grid structure, i. e. is there a transient behaviour that needs complex models or is a static model sufficient and also give evidence to computer model. Impulse current tests were performed on 16 (4 x 4) meshes. On the other hand, an old, but still easy to implement technique depend on Charge Simulation Method (CSM) is proposed to calculate the fields with the equivalent charges, the attractiveness of the CSM, when compared with the Finite Element and Finite Difference Method emanates from its simplicity in representing the equipotential surfaces of the electrodes, its application to unbounded arrangements whose boundaries extend to infinity, its direct determination to the electric field and its calculation speed. The results of the method are compared to experimental measurement results, empirical formulas in an IEEE standard and also to the other technique like (Boundary Element Method) that is often used to calculate Earth Surface Potential. In the field of grounding system design, the optimization means to find a grounding system which is able to safeguard those people that working or walking in the surroundings of the grounded installations and on the other hand has minimal cost. A new technique combining Evolutionary Algorithm with CSM field computation is proposed for optimization the design of grounding grids. The basic design quantities of the grounding grids are the ground resistance (Rg), touch voltage (Vt), step voltage (Vs) and the cost of the grounding system design. These mentioned quantities depend on the grid parameters, which are its side lengths, radius of grid conductors and length of vertical rods...|$|R

40|$|Although it {{has slowed}} considerably, {{consumption}} of electricity {{continues to grow}} in developed economies. Further, there are some unknowns which might accelerate this growth, such as electrification of vehicle fleets and geothermal heat pump space and water heating. Most analysts anticipate that distributed energy resources (DER) will provide {{a large share of}} the expanded generation capacity required to meet this seemingly inexorably increasing electricity demand. Further, given the urgency of tackling the climate change problem, most of the added assets must be carbonfree renewables or nuclear, end-use efficiency improvements, or highly efficient fossil-fired technologies. In developed economies worldwide, the current power delivery paradigm has been in place for more than a century, i. e. since the emergence of polyphase AC systems {{around the turn of the}} last century. A key feature of this structure is that, in principle, universal service is delivered at a consistent level of power quality and reliability (PQR) throughout large regions. This paper describes a future possible structure for the electricity generation and delivery system that leaves the existing high <b>voltage</b> <b>meshed</b> grid paradigm in place, but involves radical reorganization of parts of the distribution network and customer sites. Managing a much more diverse dispersed system poses major challenges to the current centralized grid paradigm, particularly since many of these assets are small to tiny by macrogrid standards and they may ultimately number in the millions. They are also not ones that centralized control can rely upon to function in traditionally dependable ways, e. g. renewable generation can be highly variable and changes in output of generators are not independent. Although most involved in the industry agree that a paradigm shift is both necessary and desirable to manage the new system, the nature of the future system remains quite unclear. In the possible structure described here, the traditional grid, or macrogrid, remains similar at the high <b>voltage</b> <b>meshed</b> level. Three new entities are added more locally: community grids or milligrids that operate a segment of the existing distribution system, microgrids which are akin to current customer sites but which have automonous control, and nanogrids, such as telecom or Ethernet networks that currently distribute power to many low-power devices. The latter exist currently in the local electrical systems but are not typically considered a part of the traditional electricity supply system. Because all these new entities exhibit some localized control, providing appropriate local heterogeneous PQR becomes a possibility. These new grid concepts enable a more "bottom-up" approach to electricity distribution, in contrast to the historic "top-down" model. The future will almost certainly include a mix of the two, but the balance among them and the interface (if any) between them is unclear...|$|R

The method allows us to gain deeper understanding of these influencing parameters.

However, most protection algorithms up to now have been designed based on extensive time domain simulations using one specific test system. Therefore, general applicability or adaptability to different configurations and system changes is not by default ensured, {{and it is difficult}} to gain in-depth understanding of the influencing parameters through time domain simulations. In order to analyse the first travelling wave for <b>meshed</b> HVDC grids, <b>voltage</b> and current wave transfer functions with respect to the incident voltage wave are derived adopting Laplace domain based component models.

Surface finish has a vital influence on functional properties such as wear resistance and power loss due to friction {{on most of the}} engineering components. <b>Voltage,</b> <b>mesh</b> number, revolutions per minute (rpm) of electromagnet, and percentage weight of abrasives has been identified as important process parameters affecting surface roughness. The experiments were planned using response surface methodology and percentage change in surface roughness (ΔRa) was considered as response. Analysis of experimental data showed that percentage change in surface roughness (ΔRa) was highly influenced by mesh number followed by percentage weight of abrasives, rpm of electromagnet, and voltage. The process has been investigated extensively in the finishing of cylindrical surfaces. The surface finish was found to improve significantly with an increase in the grain size, relative size of abrasive particles vis-à-vis the iron particles, feed rate and current. Super finishing is a micro-finishing process that produces a controlled and smooth surface condition on work pieces. It is not primarily a sizing operation, its major purpose is to produce a surface on a work piece capable of sustaining uneven distribution of a load by improving the geometrical accuracy.

Perpendicular to the propagation direction of the plasma, a fine-meshed grid covers an emission hole in the pipe. At this place, the electrons are emitted and accelerated towards an anode. Due to the emission of the electrons perpendicular to the propagation direction of the plasma, no ablated material is present in the space between emission hole and anode, whereby electrical discharges are avoided.
