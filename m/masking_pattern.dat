30|$|Alignment of mask edges along crystallographic {{directions}} on wafer surface plays {{a significant role}} in controlling the shape and size of etched profiles. In order to align the <b>mask</b> <b>patterns</b> with respect to the crystallographic {{directions on}} the wafer surface, primary flat is commonly employed as reference. In this case, any degree of misorientation in primary flat leads to the misalignment of <b>mask</b> <b>patterns</b> with respect to crystallographic directions. A small degree of misalignment of the mask edge with crystallographic direction results in oversized microstructure due to the undercutting at the misaligned mask edges. Therefore, in the fabrication of silicon-based MEMS structures using wet etching, a high precision alignment of <b>mask</b> <b>pattern</b> to crystal orientation is desirable in order to control the dimensions of fabricated structures. Several studies have been performed for the precise alignment of <b>mask</b> <b>patterns</b> with respect to crystallographic directions on { 110 } and { 100 } silicon wafers [155 - 160].

50|$|The <b>masking</b> <b>pattern</b> changes {{depending}} on {{the frequency of the}} masker and the intensity (Figure B). For low levels on the 1000 Hz graph, such as the 20-40 dB range, the curve is relatively parallel. As the masker intensity increases the curves separate, especially for signals at a frequency higher than the masker. This shows that there is a spread of the masking effect upward in frequency as the intensity of the masker is increased. The curve is much shallower in the high frequencies than in the low frequencies. This flattening is called upward spread of masking and is why an interfering sound masks high frequency signals much better than low frequency signals.|$|E

40|$|Forward masking is a {{phenomenon}} that occurs when one stimulus (masker) elevates the threshold for perception of a subsequent stimulus (probe). In cochlear implant listeners, it has been hypothesized that interactions between electrodes (termed channel interactions) can have a deleterious effect on speech recognition (Chatterjee and Shannon, 1998; Throckmorton and Collins, 1999). Forward masking is one measure {{that has been used}} to assess channel interactions (Shannon, 1983; Tong and Clark, 1986; Lim et al., 1986; Shannon, 1990; Blamey and Dooley, 1993; Chatterjee and Shannon, 1998), and it has also been proposed as a mechanism {{that could be used to}} assess information that is being presented to but is not received by the user (Throckmorton and Collins, 1999; Nogueira et al., 2005). Determining information that is not received by the user, or is masked, has the potential to provide guidance for the design of new speech processing algorithms that either work to reduce lost information or substitute alternate information. Nogueira et al., (2005) investigated the potential for using forward masking to estimate masked information and found a limited benefit with information substitution; however, their findings were based on normal hearing psychoacoustic forward <b>masking</b> <b>patterns</b> (Nogueira et al., 2005). Given that psychophysically measured forward <b>masking</b> <b>patterns</b> vary from subject to subject and electrode to electrode (e. g. Shannon, 1983; Shannon, 1990; Chatterjee and Shannon, 1998), measuring subject- and electrode-specific patterns has the potential to provide a more accurate assessment of masked information. In addition, the experimental time required to gather the full set of psychophysical forward <b>masking</b> <b>patterns</b> for all electrodes is far too long for clinical relevance (Throckmorton and Collins, 1999). Recently, it has been suggested that forward <b>masking</b> <b>patterns</b> can be measured physiologically via the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) (e. g. Hughes and Stille, 2009) which may make it possible to measure the information necessary for a subject-specific assessment of masked information in a clinically relevant time frame. This study utilized ECAP measurements to estimate the forward <b>masking</b> <b>patterns</b> in subjects, and these <b>masking</b> <b>patterns</b> were used to estimate the masked stimuli in speech. The estimates were validated using a speech reception threshold task to assess whether speech recognition is affected by removing "masked" pulses from a subject's stimulation pattern. The results of this study suggest that forward <b>masking</b> <b>patterns</b> measured via ECAPs could potentially determine information that is not being perceived by the user. The masked stimuli were also used to statistically evaluate the segments of speech that are most vulnerable to masking. These results suggest that the amount of masking that occurs per phoneme depends on the characteristics of the subject-specific <b>masking</b> <b>patterns.</b> Thesi...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Elevation of the {{threshold}} of audibility occurs in hearing-impaired people, and these individuals have an expanded auditory filter (Glasberg and Moore, 1986). Threshold elevation is assumed to occur due {{to an increase in}} frequency components that pass the auditory filter; an assumption known as the “power spectrum model ” of masking (Patterson and Moore, 1986). Therefore, we attempted here to remove from the speech signal the frequency components that are not related to speech perception, but are instead related to threshold elevation. We calculated the <b>masking</b> <b>pattern</b> using the spreading function (Painter and Spanias, 1997), and processed monosyllabic speech samples using nine kinds of masking patterns. Both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired subjects evaluated the intelligibility and sound quality of the original and processed monosyllables. For hearing-impaired subjects, the intelligibility of a small number of certain processed monosyllables increased, but sound quality did not improve. For normal-hearing subjects, speech intelligibility decreased as the <b>masking</b> <b>pattern</b> expanded, and application of the proposed method showed no significant improvement in sound quality...|$|E

30|$|Fabrication {{processes}} of nanostructured Si (Si nanowire or Si nanowall) are roughly {{divided into two}} types: top-down and bottom-up, i.e., etching of bulk Si [12 – 16] and growing Si nanowire on a substrate [17]. The advantage of the top-down process is the easy control of the direction of nanostructured Si. The starting material of this method is a Si wafer; therefore, material quality is also high enough. The typical top-down process consists of a <b>mask</b> <b>patterning</b> and anisotropic etching. The arrangement of nanostructured Si can be controlled by <b>mask</b> <b>patterning.</b> By the combination of <b>mask</b> <b>patterning,</b> e.g., nanoimprint and photolithography, and anisotropic etching, e.g., metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) [18 – 20] and reactive ion etching (RIE), various processes are selectable.

40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{generating}} coded <b>mask</b> <b>patterns</b> based on Gaussian random fields (GRF) is proposed. In contrast to traditional algorithms based on cyclic difference sets, {{it is possible}} to construct <b>mask</b> <b>patterns</b> that encode a predefined point spread function (PSF). The viability of this approach and the reproducibility of the PSFs is examined, together with studies on the mean transparency, pixel-to-pixel variance and PSF deterioration due to partial shadowing. Sensitivity considerations suggest the construction of thresholded realisations of Gaussian random fields (TGRF) which were subjected to the same analyses. Special emphasis is given to ray-tracing simulations of the pattern's performance under finite photon statistics in the observation of point sources as well as of extended sources in comparison to random <b>masks</b> and the <b>pattern</b> employed in the wide field imager onboard BeppoSAX.

The results of a different masking paradigm, based on the pulsation threshold, do reveal an effect similar to "two-tone inhibition. " Therefore, such pulsation-threshold patterns might reflect more accurately the auditory spectrum of the masker. Pulsation-threshold patterns of three vowel-like sounds were determined. These were compared with the spectral patterns of the "vowels" after analysis with a 1 / 3 octave-band filter with running centre frequency. It appeared that the pulsation-threshold patterns are sharper than the 1 / 3 octave-band spectra and, in some cases. even more pronounced than the original vowel spectra. This has interesting implications with regard to vowel-perception theories, such as theories on "formant extraction. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{perception}} of a stimulus can be impaired when presented {{in the context of}} a <b>masking</b> <b>pattern.</b> To determine the timing and the nature of face processing, the effect of various masks on the discriminability of faces was investigated. Results reveal a strong configural effect: the magnitude of masking depends on the similarity between mask and target. Masking is absent for non-face masks (noise, houses), modest for scrambled and inverted faces and strongest for upright faces, even when they differ in size, gender or viewpoint from the targets. This suggests an extra-striate location for the masking (possibly FFA). Reduced but significant masking for isolated face parts (internal features or head shape) is consistent with holistic computations in face perception. The duration over which a face mask can impair face discrimination (130 ms) is markedly longer than previously assumed and is sufficient for iterative and feedback computations to be part of face processing...|$|E

The masking produced by an 11000 Hz pure tone of 40 dB sensation level was measured at three frequencies above and three frequencies below the masker frequency. Analysis of the data revealed a downward spread of masking. Pure tone stimuli below the 11000 Hz masker showed significantly more threshold shift than those above the masker frequency. On the basis of the data collected in this investigation, it must be concluded that the upward-spread-of-masking phenomenon is not applicable at certain high frequencies.
