50|$|Yersinia is a genus of {{bacteria}} in the family Yersiniaceae. Yersinia species are Gram-negative, rod-shaped (bacillus) bacteria, a few micrometers long and fractions of a micrometer in diameter, and are facultative anaerobes. Some members of Yersinia are pathogenic in humans; in particular, Y. pestis is the causative agent of the plague. Rodents are the natural reservoirs of Yersinia; less frequently, other mammals serve as the host. Infection may occur either through blood (in the case of Y. pestis) or in an alimentary fashion, occasionally via consumption of food products (especially vegetables, milk-derived products, and <b>meat)</b> <b>contaminated</b> with infected urine or feces.|$|E

Aqueous solutions of indospicine and indospicine <b>contaminated</b> camel <b>meat</b> were microwaved (180 °C) or autoclaved (121 °C) with the addition of food-grade additives [0. 05 % (v/v) acetic acid or 0. 05 % (w/v) sodium bicarbonate] for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min. An aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution demonstrated the greatest efficacy in degrading indospicine, with complete degradation after 15 min of heating in a microwave or autoclave; concomitant formation of indospicine degradation products, namely, 2 -aminopimelamic and 2 aminopimelic acids, was observed. Similar treatment of indospicine-contaminated camel meat with aqueous sodium bicarbonate resulted in 50 % degradation after 15 min of heating in an autoclave and 100 % degradation after 15 min of heating in a microwave.

40|$|Balantidium coli is a {{zoonotic}} protozoan parasite, {{and pork}} {{is considered the}} major source of Balantidium infection in humans.
