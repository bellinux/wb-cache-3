(1) Unless otherwise stated, the defi nition of industry used in the analysis corresponds to manufacturing industry excluding energy and construction, i. e. the NACE-BEL codes 15 to 37.

Under the terms of the 1954 Act, the Aberfan disaster was not required to be formally reported to HM Inspectorate of <b>Mines</b> <b>and</b> <b>Quarries</b> because it did not take place on colliery property <b>and</b> no <b>mine</b> workers had been injured or killed.|$|R

40|$|The future {{demand for}} land for <b>mining</b> <b>and</b> <b>quarrying</b> will be {{affected}} by a large number of economic, technological, environmental and social issues within the UK. Global developments also have a role to play. Although <b>mining</b> <b>and</b> <b>quarrying</b> account for only 0. 9 per cent of the land area of England, the impact of this activity is considerable. Minerals are essential to the economy, for energy, construction, infrastructure and manufacturing, while their extraction has effects on the environment and on public perception. This paper examines current scientific understanding of the context of <b>mining</b> <b>and</b> <b>quarrying,</b> with particular reference to its impact on land use, along with the spatial relationship between minerals – which can only be worked where they occur – and other forms of land use and designation in the ‘post-industrial’ landscape of Britain. Looking out to 2060 and beyond, developments which may influence demand for minerals include climate change mitigation and adaptation; energy, food and raw material security; and new construction, manufacturing, recycling and re-use technologies. Factors influencing the supply side include the structure and ownership of the <b>mining</b> <b>and</b> <b>quarrying</b> industry, new extraction, processing and environmental technologies, ecosystem service provision, societal attitudes and land access. Although prediction carries a high level of uncertainty, continuous development of the regulatory framework is, and will remain, a major and pervasive factor in the relationship between <b>mining</b> <b>and</b> <b>quarrying</b> <b>and</b> land use. ...|$|R

40|$|The global {{trend of}} informalisation of women’s work {{is also evident}} in what is {{commonly}} known as artisanal <b>and</b> small-scale <b>mining</b> (ASM) practices. Women constitute a large segment of workers in the informal <b>mines</b> <b>and</b> <b>quarries</b> all over the world, working as cutters, diggers, sievers, panners, crushers, processors and transporters of a broad range of minerals from sand, gravel and stones to gemstones, gold <b>and</b> diamonds.
