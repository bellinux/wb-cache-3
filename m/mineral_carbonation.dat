40|$|The natural {{heavy metal}} {{enrichment}} of Tuscan ultramafic rock bodies and derived soils represents an important environmental {{concern for the}} area in which they outcrop. Moreover, most of them are superficial acquifers due to their high level of fracturing, thus representing an ideal study case to evaluate the mobility of heavy metal. Despite a comparable whole rock geochemistry, the heavy metal content of spring waters outpouring from the various ophiolitic outcrops reveals significant differences. The highest level of total chromium are detected in spring waters circulating in naturally carbonated serpentinites whereas very low chromium amount is recorded in non - carbonated serpentinite acquifers. Moreover, beside the total chromium content, also the CrVI in the most enriched waters exceed the maximum allowed from the Italian regulation and has therefore monitored and evaluated [1]. The key factors controlling both chromium mobility and carbonation potential have to be referred to the different oceanic history of these rock bodies that led in some occurrences to the alteration of the primary Cr-bearing phases. In particular, in the ophiolitic outcrop of Montecastelli Pisano (PI), serpentinisation and subsequent modal Ca-metasomatism affecting serpentinite promoted the spinel re-equilibration and Cr transfer from Mg-Al-chromite (and chromite) to adjacent newly formed silicate phases (Cr bearing garnet and Cr-chlorite) whose are significantly more sensible to weathering. The intense Fe-brucite (and serpentine) vein crosscutting the whole serpentinites should provided a viable pattern for the CO 2 -rich fluids circulating in these rocks to leach out Cr, and other elements, from alteration <b>minerals.</b> The <b>carbonation</b> of the serpentinite body, mainly affecting Fe-brucite vein, led to an of increase of the porosity an therefore enhancing the mineral weathering.

40|$|CO 2 {{absorption}} behaviour of four {{commonly used}} cement based building products: cement paste, concrete block, expanded polystyrene bead (EPB) and cement-bonded cellulose fiberboard are studied. Cement products are manufactured following industry formulation and process, and carbonation curing {{takes place in}} a chamber under a pressure of 0. 5 MPa, at ambient temperature, for durations of mostly 2 to 8 hours with both pure carbon dioxide gas and flue gas. The flue gas of 13. 8 % CO 2 content is collected from a typical cement kiln without separation. Influencing factors on carbon uptake, long-term strength as well as microstructure development are studied. It is found that the CO 2 uptake ability of those cement-based products follows the same order when exposed to either pure gas or flue gas: fiberboard has the highest uptake capacity, followed by cement paste, bead board and concrete. For fiberboard, the best CO 2 uptake in flue gas is 8. 1 %, it reaches 23. 6 % if pure gas used. Introduction of cellulose fiber in the fiberboard significantly increases voids volume and cement paste surface area through dispersing the paste onto fiber surface, effectively increasing carbonation reaction sites and thus CO 2 uptake. For pure gas carbonation with high reaction rate, it takes longer time for carbonated products to further develop strength from subsequent hydration, due to the high water loss during carbonation, the densified cement matrix structures and even fast decalcified cement <b>minerals.</b> Fast <b>carbonation</b> with pure gas is detrimental to cement paste in its long-term strength. For flue gas carbonation, both immediate strengths and long-term strength of the products are comparable with those by pure gas carbonation, although with less CO 2 uptake ability. Five CO 2 uptake determination methods are evaluated. Weight gain method is suitable for both pure gas and flue gas carbonation systems. Mass curve method is more suited for pure gas carbonation. For flue gas carbonation, CO 2 concentration method agreed well with the weight gain method. Pressure drop method is relatively less accurate because of water vapor generation during carbonation...|$|R

Twenty-two large industrial sources produced 14. 5 Mt of CO 2 in Estonia, 1. 9 Mt in Latvia and 4. 8 Mt in Lithuania in 2007. The two greatest Estonian power stations, using oil-shale, produced 9. 4 and 2. 7 Mt of CO 2. The Baltic States are located within the Baltic sedimentary basin, the thickness of which varies from 100 m in NE Estonia up to 1900 m in SW Latvia and 2300 m in western Lithuania. The most prospective formation for the geological storage of CO 2 is the Cambrian reservoir, with an estimated potential of 300 Mt of CO 2 in 15 large structures located in Latvia. Geological conditions are unfavourable for CO 2 storage in Estonia, while mineral trapping with watered oil shale ash can bind up to 10 – 12 % of CO 2 emissions produced by the above-mentioned two large stationary sources.

This work extends the traditional approach based on ab initio calculations, which can be time-consuming and costly for large systems, by using semiempirical atomistic simulations. The advantage of this approach is that very large numbers of calculations can be performed, thereby allowing a more effective search of the configurational space. The resulting free energies are used to generate the surface phase diagrams. The results indicate that the { 100 } surfaces of MgO and CaO show different dominant phases at atmospheric concentrations of gaseous water and carbon dioxide.

40|$|Fly ash and Ground Granulated Blast-furnace Slag (GGBS), two mineral {{additions}} used to partly replace ordinary Portland cement, are residues {{from coal}} combustion and steel manufacturing, respectively. Desirable properties for concrete containing these two additions are, for example, lower carbon footprint, lower heat development and higher resistance to acid, sulfate and chloride attacks, {{but they can}} also cause unwanted properties, such as increased carbonation and reduced strength. Hence, durability is in some aspects improved, while in other reduced. This study investigated how <b>mineral</b> addition influences <b>carbonation,</b> and how carbonation affects chloride migration and transport properties in mortar. Accelerated carbonation with an elevated CO 2 level of 2 % and Rapid Chloride Migration (RCM) were used. These, together with compressive strength tests (SS-EN 196 - 1) and capillary absorption tests (NT Build 368), were carried out as means of a comparative study of mortar mixtures with different levels of mineral addition and w/b ratios. Carbonation rate was increased and compressive strength was reduced, by increased amount of mineral addition, as expected. The results also showed an interdependence between different deteriorating processes. Carbonation reduced the porosity, rate of reaching saturation and connectivity of the pore structure, and it also reduced the resistance to chloride migration. Nearly all the effects caused by carbonation were magnified by the amount of mineral addition, except for some reverse effects on high levels of GGBS.

40|$|Understanding the {{controlling}} factors and elucidating the requirements and conditions necessary for carbon dioxide (CO 2) storage by <b>mineral</b> trapping (or <b>carbonation)</b> is of paramount interest for any technical application {{as a means}} for carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). The effect of pH, supersaturation and substrate has been studied using non-stirred batch reactors at initial constant temperature of 150 oC. These conditions are relevant for mineral trapping. A set of experiments was conducted, where solid carbonate were precipitated from a range of solution compositions. Saturation state and composition of experimental solutions were calculated using the numerical code PHREEQC- 2. Two main aqueous inlet solutions containing MgCl 2 and Mg(CH 3 COO) 2 with incremental changes in concentration were reacted on feldspar and basalt separately. The substrates used in the experiment, as well as secondary mineral phases that were formed from the experiments were identified using Raman spectroscopy analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Results from the experiments show that the growth of secondary carbonates is highly connected to the reactivity of the substrate surface, and that the spatial distribution (number and crystal sizes) of the secondary phases on the surface is highly heterogeneous. Moreover, growth of the magnesian carbonates is highly dynamic with phases being formed and dissolved in a sequence of reactions controlled by the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of the minerals, and by local chemical gradients given by the substrate dissolution. SEM observations also confirmed that acetate was an excellent inhibitor to magnesian carbonate formation in general, with the exception of magnesite at higher pH. This work provides a starting point for future experiments that will more accurately elucidate the solid-solution relationships of carbonates, and provide a template upon which the origin of magnesian carbonates of similar chemistry may be reconciled...|$|R
40|$|Known {{fossil fuel}} reserves, {{especially}} coal, can support global energy demands for centuries to come, if the environmental {{problems associated with}} CO{sub 2 } emissions can be overcome. Unlike other CO{sub 2 } sequestration candidate technologies that propose long-term storage, mineral sequestration provides permanent disposal by forming geologically stable <b>mineral</b> carbonates. <b>Carbonation</b> of the widely occurring mineral olivine (e. g., forsterite, Mg{sub 2 }SiO{sub 4 }) is a large-scale sequestration process candidate for regional implementation, which converts CO{sub 2 } into the environmentally benign mineral magnesite (MgCO{sub 3 }). The primary goal is cost-competitive process development. As the process is exothermic, it inherently offers low-cost potential. Enhancing carbonation reactivity is key to economic viability. Recent studies at the U. S. DOE Albany Research Center have established that aqueous-solution carbonation using supercritical CO{sub 2 } is a promising process; even without olivine activation, 30 - 50 % carbonation has been achieved in an hour. Mechanical activation (e. g., attrition) has accelerated the carbonation process to an industrial timescale (i. e., near completion {{in less than an}} hour), at reduced pressure and temperature. However, the activation cost is too high to be economical and lower cost pretreatment options are needed. Herein, we report our first year progress in exploring a novel approach that offers the potential to substantially enhance carbonation reactivity while bypassing pretreatment activation. We have discovered that robust silica-rich passivating layers form on the olivine surface during carbonation. As carbonation proceeds, these passivating layers thicken, fracture and eventually exfoliate, exposing fresh olivine surfaces during rapidly-stirred/circulating carbonation. We are exploring the mechanisms that govern carbonation reactivity and the impact that (1) modeling/controlling the slurry fluid-flow conditions, (2) varying the aqueous ion species/size and concentration (e. g., Li{sup +}, Na{sup +}, K{sup +}, Rb{sup +}, Cl{sup -}, HCO{sub 3 }{sup -}), and (3) incorporating select sonication offer to enhance exfoliation and carbonation. Thus far, we have succeeded in nearly doubling the extent of carbonation observed compared with the optimum procedure previously developed by the Albany Research Center. Aqueous carbonation reactivity was found to be a strong function of the ionic species present and their aqueous activities, as well as the slurry fluid flow conditions incorporated. Synergistic control of these parameters offers the potential for further improvements in carbonation reactivity. A new sonication exfoliation system incorporating a novel sealing system was developed to carry out the sonication studies. Our initial studies that incorporate controlled sonication have not yet lead to a significant improvement in the extent of carbonation observed. Year 2 studies will emphasize those approaches that offer the greatest potential to cost effectively enhance carbonation, as well as combined approaches that may further enhance carbonation. Mechanistic investigations indicate incongruent dissolution results in the observed silica-rich passivating layer formation. Observations of magnesite nanocrystals within the passivating layers that form indicate the layers can exhibit significant permeability to the key reactants present (e. g., Mg{sup 2 +}, H{sup +}, H{sub 2 }O, CO{sub 2 }, and HCO{sub 3 } -). Atomistic modeling supports the observation of robust passivating layers that retain significant permeability to the key reaction species involved. Studies in Year 2 will emphasize the impact that controlled aqueous speciation and activity and slurry-flow dynamics have on the mechanisms that control carbonation reactivity and the potential they offer to substantially reduce olivine mineral sequestration process cost...|$|R

40|$|More {{and more}} studies {{carried out on}} the Geosphere-Biosphere {{interactions}} show how the Biosphere can influence, involve, slow down or speed up the inorganic processes. CO 2 -atmospheric sequestration is an important process that spontaneously occurs in the carbonated serpentinites at Montecastelli site (Tuscany, Italy). In the studied area, carbonate precipitates, mainly hydrated Mg-carbonates, are present in form of crusts, coating and spherules on exposed surfaces, in rock fractures and on tailings in a small mine dump. Selected serpentinites sample, associated with hydrated Mg-carbonates, have been collected and analyzed to investigate the serpentinites alteration and the related carbonate products, the presence of biological activity and its influence on the overall process. Thin sections of unaltered and carbonated serpentinites and carbonate precipitates have been prepared for petrographic and SEM-EDS observations. Their study revealed that Montecastelli serpentinites are mostly unaltered {{with respect to the}} carbonation process; samples preserve their original pseudomorphic mesh to hourglass texture of the serpentine after olivine, with magnetite-rich mesh rims and relicts of primary spinel. Hydrated Mg-carbonate precipitation is restricted to pre-existing veins or, more commonly, to the rock surface. They form whitish thin crust with laminar or bubble-like appearance, white small spherules over the crust or just on the rock surface, or mixing between them. The different precipitated types have been selected under binocular microscope for XRD analyses performed at the Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra (University of Pisa, Italy) : precipitated minerals which can be traced are hydromagnesite, nesquehonite, manasseite, pyroaurite, brugnatellite, often associated with aragonite. Detailed analyses using Confocal Raman microspectroscopy and electron microscopy have been performed at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP, France). The spectra Raman can provide evidence of the presence of organic compounds, such as aliphatic and aromatic mixtures. The presence of active microbial communities in hydrated Mg-carbonates could promote and/or enhance the acid-base reaction, through which the serpentine, reacting with the carbon dioxide, transforms into hydromagnesite or in other metastable hydrated Mg-carbonates. In nature, the considered acid-base reaction occurs very slowly, so that bacteria can behave like catalysts, increasing the reaction rate and promoting this key reaction to occur in a relatively short time.

40|$|Bricks {{production}} requires important inputs {{of resources}} and energy and causes several environmental impacts, such as carbon emissions [1]. Studies [2 - 4] have indicated {{that most of the}} energy consumption and emissions can be directly attributed to the firing stage of the production process. The environmental impacts of brick production have induced research for environmentally viable alternatives to the firing stage. Amongst them, carbonation and alkali activation are very promising options [5, 6]. Carbonation is a process wherein materials rich in alkali oxides react with CO 2 to form stable carbonate minerals under natural or accelerating environment. Alkali-activated materials are alternative building materials prepared by means of reaction between an alkali with materials rich in CaO. A possible source of <b>minerals</b> available for <b>carbonation</b> and alkali activation are stainless steel slags, thanks to their high calcium oxide content rendering a high alkalinity [7, 8]. According to [9], during the production of stainless steel, 2 to 4 tons of waste (sludge and slags) are generated per ton of steel produced, resulting in an estimated global production ranging from 220 to 420 Mt of slags per year [7]. Today slags are usually recycled as filling material in construction (down cycling) or directly landfilled. However, interest in using steel making slags in more added-value carbonation and alkali- activation based products has risen since the slags are cheap and readily available secondary raw material. Additionally, the recycling of the slags as a secondary source can reduce the amount of harmful substances contained in the slags and released to the environment, as they will be trapped {{in the structure of the}} new inert materials [10]. The study investigates the environmental benefits of production of innovative bricks made from stainless steel making slags. Three different brick types (called SSSBricks) were developed using slags from stainless steel making processes. One type (perforated) has been made through carbonation, while two other brick types (solid and aerated) have been produced through alkali-activation. The alkali-activated bricks were produced by mixing two types of slag, Argon Oxygen Decarburization (AOD) slags and Continuous Casting (CtCs) slags, with river sand at 1 : 3 wt ratio and a mixture of Na/K hydroxides and Na/K silicates. They were cured in a steam curing chamber. For solid bricks the steam curing temperature was kept at 90 °C and atmospheric pressure, whereas the aerated bricks were cured at 150 °C and 4 bar pressure. The carbonation was carried out on perforated bricks in a carbonation chamber with 10 % volume of CO 2 at atmospheric pressure and also in a carbonation reactor at 80 °C and partial pressure of 8 bars in a 100 % CO 2 environment. In order to identify the key environmental gains related to the use of SSSBricks, an environmental assessment including energy consumption, resource use and waste management is required [11]. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been conducted in order to assess the environmental impacts associated with the production phase of the SSSBricks. Impacts from production of a SSSBrick have been compared with impacts from production of traditional bricks with similar properties (substitutes) that are already available in European markets. In particular, traditional clay-bricks are compared with solid and perforated SSSBicks, while autoclaved concrete bricks are compared with aerated SSSBricks. The LCA results show that solid and perforated SSSBricks have lower overall impacts compared with clay bricks, while aerated SSSBricks carry the higher impacts compared with autoclaved bricks. The results proved that the avoided use of fossil fuels and energy, due to the omission of a firing stage in carbonation and alkali activition processes, lowers significantly the environmental burdens. Furthermore, the avoided impacts of slag stabilization (required in order to dispose the slag in landfills or to recycle them as filling material) and the CO 2 uptake (in carbonation) contribute to the positive environmental profile of SSSBricks. However the electricity consumption, the necessity of a pure CO 2 gas stream in carbonation and the production of alkali-activators represent the main drawback of the processes.

Carbonation of red mud using carbon dioxide (CO₂) has previously been demonstrated to be feasible in both permanently capturing the CO₂ and neutralising this solid waste. A systematic study of the neutralisation of red mud by CO₂ over a range of different operating conditions is essential in order to optimise the carbonation process and maximise the volume of CO₂ captured by red mud. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the acid neutralisation capacity of red mud and its solid and aqueous phase contribution to the acid neutralisation capacity via the analyses of red mud compositions. A red mud sample, provided by Rio Tinto Alcan, was carbonated in a range of different operating conditions with the intent of establishing the optimal condition for the carbonation process. The carbonation was carried out at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using a stirred tank reactor operating at different conditions such as total gas flow rate, CO₂ concentrations, stirring speeds, and solids concentrations in red mud. A range of analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Carbon-Hydrogen-Nitrogen Elemental Analyser (CHN) were used to ascertain the different mineral phases, change of chemical composition before and after carbonation, and carbonation capacity of the mud. Finally, based on the information of red mud composition, an equilibrium chemical model using MINEQL+ version 5. 0 was developed for the carbonation process. The acid neutralisation capacity of red mud was measured by both rapid and long-term titration of red mud slurries to pH endpoint of 4. 5, 6, 8, and 10. At the endpoint of pH 4. 5 corresponding to the bicarbonate endpoint, the acid neutralisation capacity of the red mud was found to be 0. 79 and 1. 91 meq/g red mud for rapid and long-term titration, respectively. Furthermore, it is estimated that the solid phase contributed approximately 81 % to the acid neutralisation capacity, while contribution from the liquid phase was only 19 % in the final long-term acid neutralisation capacity determination. The carbonation process was observed to be significantly dependent on concentration of CO₂, total gas flow rate and stirring speeds, whereas the concentration of solids in red mud seemed to have a little effect based on only three concentrations studied. For the carbonation of red mud slurry, it took from 30 - 75 minutes to establish the equilibrium pH of 7. 5 - 6. 6 in the range of CO₂ concentrations of 10 %- 100 %. In contrast, when the carbonation of red mud liquor only was performed at the same range of CO₂ values, the stable pH of 7. 0 - 6. 3 (0. 3 - 0. 5 pH unit lower) was reached within 15 - 30 minutes. After carbonation, the pH from carbonated red mud slurries, exposed to atmosphere CO₂, rebound quickly and took about 20 - 25 days to reach pH of 9. 7. The carbonated liquor, however, showed a lower rate of pH recovery, and took a month to equilibrate to pH of 9. 7. The XRD patterns of carbonated red mud revealed the appearance of calcite and the increase of gibbsite due to the dissolution of sodalite and the breakdown of cancrinite <b>minerals</b> in the <b>carbonation</b> of red mud. The quantifications confirmed the precipitation of calcite from 0 % to 1. 51 %, and the increase of gibbsite from 1. 04 % to 5. 15 % in raw red mud and carbonated red mud, respectively. XRD patterns and the quantifications associated with other results such as EDX and CHN analyses indicated that the most optimal conditions for carbonation process were 30 % CO₂ concentration and total gas flow rate of 200 mL/min. At this condition, the amount of CO₂ captured for the whole red mud (both solid and liquid phases) was highest at 65 g CO₂/kg of red mud, and the alkalinity decreased from 11, 610 mg/L to 2, 104 mg/L as CaCO₃. Stirring speeds were found to be effective in boosting the extent of red mud carbonation and the amount of CO₂ sequestration. The results showed that when stirring speeds rose from 250 rpm to 700 rpm, the amount of CO₂ sequestration increased by 3. 4 g/kg of red mud, from 65 to 68. 4 g CO₂/kg of red mud. The simulation for heavy metals dissolved in long-term titration of red mud at different pH levels of 4. 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12. 5 was performed using chemical equilibrium modelling system MINEQL+ 5. 0. The modelling suggested that four key dominant metals Al, Na, Ca, and Fe were found to govern the aqueous chemistry of the red mud carbonation process due to their presence in both soluble and solid forms in red mud. Measured metal concentrations from long-term titration at various pH values indicated that boehmite (AlO(OH)) and hematite (Fe₂O₃) did not dissolve in the system, therefore, both Al and Fe were not responsible for the control of carbonation process as their concentrations remained unchanged. However, Na and Ca were considered the major solids controlling the process. The dissolution of sodalite (Na₈(AlSiO₄) ₆(OH) ₂. 4 H₂O) and cancrinite (Na₆(AlSiO₄) ₆(CaCO₃) (H₂O) ₂) were attributable to Na and Ca concentrations in the system. The key reactions are as below: Na₈(AlSiO₄) ₆(OH) ₂. 4 H₂O + 18 H⁺ = 8 Na⁺ + 6 Al³⁺ + 6 Si(OH) ₄ + 2 H₂O and Na₆(Al₆Si₆O₂₄) (CaCO₃) (H₂O) ₂+ 24 H+ = 6 Na⁺+ 6 Al³⁺ + 6 Si(OH) ₄ +Ca²⁺+CO₃²⁻+ 2 H₂O For carbonation process, a chemical model was formulated in MINEQL+ 5. 0 to calculate the final equilibrium pH values for both carbonation of RM slurry and RM liquor at different concentration of CO₂. The results revealed that the simulated pH values for the carbonation process at different Pᴄᴏ₂ were 0. 3 - 0. 45 pH units higher than the experimental pH values. In other words, the difference in final pH equilibrium values between experimental and simulated carbonation of red mud varies from 4. 0 - 6. 0 %. This difference is about 2 times lower than that of previous work done by Khaitan (2009 b). Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Chemical Engineering, 2016...|$|R

This collaborative project looked at {{a wide range of}} generic issues about this CO 2 mitigation option, with particular views on assessing its potential in the context of New-Caledonia. Indeed, insularity and local abundance of 'carbonatable' rocks and industrial wastes (i. e. rich in MgO, CaO, if not Fe(II) O), coupled with significant GHG emissions from first-class nickel pyrometallurgical industries, make it a potential candidate for application of ex-situ <b>mineral</b> <b>carbonation.</b> The project conducted a worldwide analysis of the potential of ex-situ <b>mineral</b> <b>carbonation</b> using a dedicated SIG-based tool.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 <b>Mineral</b> <b>carbonation</b> of basalt {{has been}} {{proposed}} by various researchers to reduce anthropogenic CO₂ output without necessitating considerable reduction of fossil fuel usage. The feasibility of any mafic rock for <b>mineral</b> <b>carbonation</b> depends on the present mineralogy, texture, grain size, and alteration. The purpose {{of this research is}} the development of a methodology for the characterization of mafic rocks regarding their susceptibility for <b>mineral</b> <b>carbonation,</b> based on samples from mine tailings in the Keweenaw Peninsula, Michigan. Samples were characterized using petrographic examination, microprobe analyses, whole rock data, and thermodynamic modeling. Thin section analyses revealed several alteration assemblages ranging from relatively fresh samples to extremely altered samples. End-members of minerals present in the study area were used for thermodynamic modeling. Based on thermodynamics, anorthite, prehnite, and diopside are the most feasible minerals for carbonation, minerals potentially viable include forsterite, enstatite, talc, clinochlore, and phengite. To determine feasible minerals for carbonation, kinetic modeling should be conducted to establish minerals with realistic reaction rates. The approach outlined in this study can be used as an inexpensive and expeditious method to determine mafic samples most feasible for <b>mineral</b> <b>carbonation</b> based on thermodynamic modeling. Not all mafic rocks should be treated as basalts, nor are all mafic rocks equally feasible for <b>mineral</b> <b>carbonation...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{availability}} of industrial alkalinity sources is investigated {{to determine their}} potential for the simultaneous capture and sequestration of CO 2 from point-source emissions in the United States. Industrial alkalinity sources investigated include fly ash, cement kiln dust, and iron and steel slag. Their feasibility for <b>mineral</b> <b>carbonation</b> is determined by their relative abundance for CO 2 reactivity and their proximity to point-source CO 2 emissions. In addition, the available aggregate markets are investigated as possible sinks for <b>mineral</b> <b>carbonation</b> products. We show that in the U. S., industrial alkaline byproducts {{have the potential to}} mitigate approximately 7. 6 Mt CO 2 /yr, of which 7. 0 Mt CO 2 /yr are CO 2 captured through <b>mineral</b> <b>carbonation</b> and 0. 6 Mt CO 2 /yr are CO 2 emissions avoided through reuse as synthetic aggregate (replacing sand and gravel). The emission reductions represent a small share (i. e., 0. 1 %) of total U. S.

40|$|Long term {{geological}} {{storage of}} CO 2 is currently considered a most attractive {{option in the}} reduction of greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to utilize fossil fuels for energy production. <b>Mineral</b> <b>carbonation</b> is a long term storage option where CO 2 binds with geologic material (certain rocks minerals) to form stable environmentally benign carbonate minerals (carbonation). Rocks containing the elements calcium (Ca) and or magnesium (Mg) bound in silicate minerals are considered feasible for the process of <b>mineral</b> <b>carbonation.</b> In this study a two phase assessment {{of the potential for}} <b>mineral</b> <b>carbonation</b> as a means of CO 2 sequestration in South Africa is investigated. The desktop study investigates suitable locations of ultramafic or silicate bearing rocks in South Africa, for the purpose of <b>mineral</b> <b>carbonation.</b> Potential starting materials and reaction routes are addressed, as well as the slow kinetics of the solid –fluid mineral reaction rates. Current global projects are examined, their applicability in the South African context assessed. The investigation, though conceptual, is hoped to add value to South Africa’s carbon emission mitigation strategy. The experimental study compares the data resulting from the generation of CO 2 adsorption isotherms of a basalt and shale, to those generated from a coal and ash under similar experimental conditions. As adsorption isotherms provide information pertaining to the uptake of CO 2 by a material, and not retention, a second aim of the study attempts to determine the effect of supercritical CO 2 on mineral composition of these rocks, over a period of thirty days or so. This period of time may be insufficient for <b>mineral</b> <b>carbonation</b> to have a detectable effect; longer term samples, are anticipated in future research projects.
