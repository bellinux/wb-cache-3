40|$|Mortality {{data have}} become {{increasingly}} important not only in health related studies but also in development studies as a whole. The demand for data on life expectancy and the infant mortality rate is met by five publications [...] the UN Demographic Yearbook, World Population Prospects, World Development Report, World Population Trends <b>and</b> Policies <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Report,</b> <b>and</b> World Population. Within these statistical publications, life expectancy and the infant mortality rate are available for nearly every country each year. However, recent empirical information on mortality in most developing exists only {{for a handful of}} countries. The estimates published in the World Development <b>Report</b> <b>and</b> World Population Prospects are based on old empirical data updated with assumed rates of improvement in mortality. Neither of these sources provide technical notes explaining the original data source, estimation technique, and updating model used. Fortunately, two sources, the World Population Trends <b>and</b> Policies <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Report</b> <b>and</b> World Population, publish only empirically based data clearly identifying source, year of applicability, and estimation technique. The work in the World Development <b>Report</b> <b>and</b> the World Population Prospects could be made more useful if they provided adequate technical documentation for each estimate. At present, the <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Report</b> <b>and</b> World Population are the only appropriate sources for quantitative analysis of mortality or of change in mortality. mortality life expectancy data quality health status...|$|R

5000|$|Administrative: A {{focus on}} survey administration, data {{gathering}} {{and analysis of}} results (rather than taking action) may also damage engagement efforts. Organizations that survey their workforce without acting on the feedback appear to negatively impact engagement scores. The <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>oversight</b> requirements of engagement initiatives represent a claim on the scarcest resources (time and money) of the organisation, and therefore requires management time to demonstrate value added. At the same time, actions {{on the basis of}} engagement surveys are usually devolved to local management, where any 'value add' is counted in local performance. Central administration of 'employee engagement' is therefore challenging to maintain over time.|$|R
