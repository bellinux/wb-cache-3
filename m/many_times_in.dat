5|$|After the Gibraltar hearings, Mary Celeste {{continued}} in service under new owners. In 1885, her captain deliberately wrecked her {{off the coast of}} Haiti, as part of an attempted insurance fraud. The story of her 1872 abandonment has been recounted and dramatized <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> <b>in</b> documentaries, novels, plays and films, {{and the name of the}} ship has become a byword for unexplained desertion.|$|E

Though having worked with Chakri <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> the past, at Mahesh's suggestion, Jagannadh instead chose Mani Sharma to compose the film's music. Shyam K. Naidu was the film's cinematographer and Marthand K. Venkatesh its editor. Chinna and Krishna were the film's art director {{and executive producer}} respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{book has}} been reprinted <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> <b>in</b> at least 16 English {{versions}} and in Spanish, Chinese and German editions.

5|$|David Kaczynski {{had tried}} to remain {{anonymous}} at first, but he was soon identified, {{and within a few}} days an FBI agent team was dispatched to interview David and his wife with their attorney in Washington, D.C. At this and subsequent meetings, David provided letters written by his brother in their original envelopes, allowing the FBI task force to use the postmark dates to add more detail to their timeline of Ted's activities. David developed a respectful relationship with the primary Task Force behavioral analyst, Special Agent Kathleen M. Puckett, whom he met <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> Washington, D.C., Texas, Chicago, and Schenectady, New York, over the nearly two months before the federal search warrant was served on Kaczynski's cabin.|$|E
5|$|Gisa {{obtained}} land {{grants for}} the upkeep {{of the church}} and canons from King Edward the Confessor and the later kings Harold Godwinson and William I of England. He is mentioned <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> the Domesday Book as the holder of land for the see, and was notorious for acquiring land throughout his bishopric. The only surviving writ of Harold's issued while Harold was king dealt with Giso's rights as bishop, and was addressed to Abbot Æthelnoth of Glastonbury, the sheriff of Somerset, and the thegns of Somerset.|$|E

5|$|Jerusalem is {{recognized}} as a sacred site in Islam. Though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem by name, it has been understood by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in the Quran refer to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is also mentioned <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> the hadith. Some academics attribute the holiness of Jerusalem to the rise and expansion of {{a certain type of}} literary genre, known as al-Fadhail or history of cities. The Fadhail of Jerusalem inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts. Others point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification of Jerusalem in Islam.|$|E
5|$|Some early writers {{theorized that}} the last saber-toothed cats, Smilodon and Homotherium, became extinct through {{competition}} with the faster and more generalized felids that replaced them. It was even proposed that the saber-toothed predators were inferior to modern cats, as the ever-growing canines were thought to inhibit their owners from feeding properly. Yet fast felids such as the American lion and the American cheetah also became extinct during the Late Pleistocene. The fact that saber-teeth evolved <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> unrelated lineages also attests {{to the success of}} this feature.|$|E
5|$|Some of Escher's many {{tessellation}} drawings {{were inspired}} by conversations with the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter on hyperbolic geometry. Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> his work. The Platonic solids—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in Order and Chaos and Four Regular Solids. These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.|$|E

5|$|Upon release, Sonic Advance {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised its graphics and favorably {{compared it to}} the original Genesis games. The game was also a major commercial success, selling 1.21 million copies and is among the GBA's best-selling titles. The game {{is the first in}} the Sonic franchise developed by Dimps, who would return to the series <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> later years. Two sequels, Sonic Advance 2 and Sonic Advance 3, were later developed and released for the GBA in 2002 and 2004, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Charles Y. Harvey {{began work}} on Boy with Turtle at his studio in New York City, believing that this work {{was going to be}} his masterpiece. Almost {{immediately}} he began second guessing his design and feeling that it was inadequate. This negativity was a trait that he had shown <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> the past. Roughly a week after beginning the sculpture, Harvey began hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. A paper about restoring the sculpture written at Worcester Polytechnic Institute claims the voices he was hearing were coming from the partially carved sculpture itself. These voices set the date of Saturday January 27, 1912 for Harvey to kill himself. On that date he laid down his tools, headed to Bronx Park with two razors, and slit his own throat along {{the west bank of the}} Bronx River.|$|E
5|$|Former Georgetown University {{basketball}} coach John Thompson had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77. As {{he would tell}} the story <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> the following years, including a September 12, 2011 interview on Jim Rome's radio show, he {{had been scheduled to}} appear on that show on September 12, 2001. Thompson was planning to be in Las Vegas for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th. However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him to travel {{on the day of the}} show. After a Rome staffer personally assured Thompson that he would be able to travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas immediately after the show, Thompson changed his travel plans. He felt the impact from the crash at his home near the Pentagon.|$|E

5|$|Jack Russells are an {{energetic}} breed {{that rely on}} {{a high level of}} exercise and stimulation and are relatively free from serious health complaints. Originating from dogs bred and used by Reverend John Russell in the early 19th century, from whom the breed takes its name, the Jack Russell has similar origins to the modern Fox terrier. It has gone through several changes over the years, corresponding to different use and breed standards set by kennel clubs. Recognition by kennel clubs for the Jack Russell breed has been opposed by the breed's parent societies – which resulted in the breeding and recognition of the Parson Russell terrier. Jack Russells have appeared <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> film, television, and print - with several historical dogs of note.|$|E
5|$|Sing {{transferred}} to the 31st Infantry Battalion on 27 July 1916 at Tel-el-Kibir and sailed to England the following month. Following {{a brief period of}} training in England, he sailed for France and entered action on the Western Front in January 1917. He was wounded in action several times, and commended <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> reports by Allied commanders. In March 1917, he was wounded in the left leg and hospitalised in England. In May 1917, while recovering in Scotland, he met waitress Elizabeth A. Stewart (c. 1896–unknown), who was the daughter of Royal Navy cook George Stewart. The two were married on 29 June 1917 in Edinburgh. In July 1917, Elizabeth Sing's address was noted in records as 6 Spring Gardens, Stockbridge, Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|The {{field is}} characterised by some key concepts, which took {{biologists}} by surprise. One is deep homology, {{the finding that}} dissimilar organs such as the eyes of insects, vertebrates and cephalopod molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as pax-6, from the evo-devo gene toolkit. These genes are ancient, being highly conserved among phyla; they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ is the way that gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> different parts of the embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple pleiotropic reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.|$|E
