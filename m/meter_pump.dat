In {{the absence of a}} drive shaft or flow <b>meter,</b> <b>pump</b> flow assessment is made with an algorithm based on currents required for impeller rotation and stabilization. The aim {{of this study is to}} validate pump performance, algorithm-based flow and effective flow. A series of bovine experiments was realized after equipment with pressure transducers, continuous-cardiac-output-catheter, intracardiac ultrasound (AcuNav) over 6 h. Pump implantation was through a median sternotomy (LV! VAD! calibrated transonic-flow-probe! aorta). A transonic-HT 311 -flow-probe was fixed onto the outflow cannula for flow comparison. Animals were electively sacrificed and at necropsy systematic pump inspection and renal embolus score was realized. Observation period was 340 ^ 62. 4 min. The axial pump generated a mean arterial pressure of 58. 8 ^ 14. 3 mmHg (max 117 mmHg) running at a speed of 6591. 3 ^ 1395. 4 rev. /min (min 5000 /max 8500 rev. /min) and generating 2. 5 ^ 1. 0 l/min (min 1. 4 /max 6. 0 l/min) of flow. Correlation between the results of the pump flow algorithm and measured pump flow was linear (y 1 : 0339 x; R 2 0 : 9357). VAD explants were free of macroscopic thrombi. Renal embolus score was 0 ^ 0. The magnetically suspended axial flow pump provides excellent left ventricular support. The pump flow algorithm used is accurate and reliable. Therefore, there is no need for direct flow measurement...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{approach}} to developing variable-rate sprayer technologies is to install electronic control systems on conventional sprayers. This study introduces a direct injection type electronic solution concentration control system. This control system was installed {{on a field}} sprayer, and then a map-based variable-rate sprayer was developed. The control system consisted of a chemical tank, a chemical <b>metering</b> <b>pump,</b> the <b>metering</b> <b>pump’s</b> driver, the <b>metering</b> <b>pump’s</b> speed sensor, the implement’s travelling speed sensor, an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), a GPS receiver and a mixing unit. The <b>metering</b> <b>pump</b> discharge was measured at different carrier liquid (water) working pressures (3, 4 and 5 bar) and different chemical <b>metering</b> <b>pump</b> shaft speed (100, 200, 300 and 400 r/min, i. e. pump’s working range). Data analysis showed {{that the effect of}} <b>metering</b> <b>pump</b> speed, sprayer working pressure and their interaction was significant (P< 0. 001) on the <b>metering</b> <b>pump’s</b> discharge. <b>Metering</b> <b>pump’s</b> discharge function and the independent variables of pump speed and working pressure were calculated. In order to determine the system response time, an electromotor replaced on the right hand front wheel of the tractor (the implement’s traveling speed sensor location), thus simulating the implement’s movement. An Electrical Conductivity (EC) sensor was mounted on rightmost nozzle of the boom. The chemical tank was filled with thick brine. The system response time was measured at different working pressures (3, 4 and 5 bar), travelling speeds (3, 6 and 9 km h- 1) and spraying concentration change rates (2, 3 and 4 L ha- 1). The working pressure was the only variable with a significant effect on the response time at the 1 % level. The mean of response times were 25. 8, 22. 8 and 17. 9 s at 3, 4 and 5 bar working pressures, respectively. The look-ahead firmwar...|$|R

2500|$|Internally {{the rotor}} is cooled and {{lubricated}} by engine sump {{oil and the}} aforementioned trochoid pump. Engine oil is filtered by an easily accessible car-type oil filter on the lower {{right side of the}} cases. The filter includes an internal bypass valve in case of blockage. Further lubrication specifically for the tip, corner and side seals is provided by oil from a tank located under the seat. An engine-driven <b>metering</b> <b>pump</b> sends oil from this external tank into the carburetor at a ratio of around 100:1. Metering of the oil quantity is mechanically controlled by cables from the throttle grip. The <b>metering</b> <b>pump</b> also provided lubrication for the final drive chain. A second line is routed from the <b>metering</b> <b>pump</b> and around the bike, ending just above the drive chain behind the sprocket cover. This feature was also disconnected on the [...] "A" [...] models by a simple blanking plug at the <b>metering</b> <b>pump.</b> The gearbox is separated from the engine sump and has its own oil supply. Suzuki marketed its own brand of rotary oil but also approved at least two other oils for use in its rotary engine. Shell Super 10-20-50 and Castrol GTX were both endorsed lubricants.|$|R

5000|$|Liquids {{are only}} very {{slightly}} compressible. This property of liquids lets <b>metering</b> <b>pumps</b> discharge liquids at high pressure. Since a liquid can be only slightly compressed during a discharge stroke, it is {{forced out of}} the pump head. Gases are much more compressible. <b>Metering</b> <b>pumps</b> are not good at pumping gases. Sometimes, a <b>metering</b> or similar <b>pump</b> has to be primed before operation, i. e. the pump head filled with the liquid to be pumped. When gas bubbles enter a pump head, the compression motion compresses the gas but has a hard time forcing it out of the pump head. The pump may stop pumping liquid with gas bubbles in the pump head even though mechanically the pump is going through the motions, repeatedly compressing and decompressing the bubbles. To prevent this type of [...] "vapor lock", chromatography solvents are often degassed before pumping.|$|R
