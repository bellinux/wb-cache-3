2500|$|Guicciardini served three popes over {{a period}} of twenty years, and perhaps because of his experiences, he was highly {{critical}} of the papacy: [...] "I don't know anyone who dislikes the ambition, the avarice, and the sensuality of priests more than I do.... Nevertheless, the position I have enjoyed with several popes has forced me to love their greatness for my own self-interest. If it weren't for this consideration, I would have loved Martin Luther as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> myself—not to be released from the laws taught by the Christian religion as it is normally interpreted and understood, but to see this band of ruffians reduced within their correct bounds." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon being {{convinced}} {{that he had not}} robbed anyone of their melody, McCartney began writing lyrics to suit it. As Lennon and McCartney were known to do at the time, a substitute working lyric, titled [...] "Scrambled Eggs" [...] (the working opening verse was [...] "Scrambled eggs/Oh my baby how I love your legs/Not as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> scrambled eggs"), was used for the song until something more suitable was written. In his biography, , McCartney recalled: [...] "So first of all I checked this melody out, and people said to me, 'No, it's lovely, and I'm sure it's all yours.' It took me a little while to allow myself to claim it, but then like a prospector I finally staked my claim; stuck a little sign on it and said, 'Okay, it's mine!' It had no words. I used to call it 'Scrambled Eggs'." [...] The original song, Scrambled Eggs, was written to hold the music and phrasing in place. It was performed by Paul McCartney and Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and has been recorded and released by the Brittles, a Beatles-pastiche band.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "With Twilight as My Guide" [...] {{appears to}} take place during the Salem Witch Trials, which is {{revealed}} through an interview with opera singer Renée Fleming, who covered the song on her album Dark Hope: [...] "I was especially fascinated by the Mars Volta song, 'With Twilight As My Guide', which is operatic in its scale and musical complexity. I was however a bit concerned about the text, specifically the reference to 'devil daughters'. I said, 'As <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> this song, I really can't sing it for that reason.' Peter Mensch offered to contact Cedric Bixler-Zavala and asked if the text could be changed, since the overall meaning of the song wasn't completely clear anyway. Cedric responded, [...] "Sure, she can change it. I would just {{like it to be}} known that in no way is the lyric supposed to paint women in a bad light... The song feels like it was written during the Salem Witch Trials, and it sarcastically takes the religious right wing slang of how all women were treated. Our last album, Bedlam in Goliath, was one huge metaphor for the way women are treated in Islamic society (honor killings, etc) not just a story about a ouija board... it's meant to make you question the way things are." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another Verhoeven film—the erotic thriller Basic Instinct (1992)— {{she took}} on the role that made her a star, playing Catherine Tramell, a brilliant, bisexual, alleged serial killer. Several actresses at the time turned down the role, mostly because of the nudity required. In the film's most notorious scene, Tramell is being {{questioned}} by the police, and she crosses and uncrosses her legs, exposing her vulva, which is not covered by underwear. According to Stone, she agreed to film the flashing scene with no underwear, and although she and Verhoeven had discussed the scene {{from the beginning of}} production, she was unaware just how explicit the infamous shot would be: [...] "I knew {{that we were going to}} do this leg-crossing thing and I knew that we were going to allude to the concept that I was nude, but I did not think that you would see my vagina in the scene. Later, when I saw it in the screening I was shocked. I think seeing it in a room full of strangers was so disrespectful and so shocking, so I went into the booth and slapped him and left". Stone claimed in an earlier interview, however, that [...] "it was so fun" [...] watching the film for the first time with strangers. Verhoeven has denied all claims of trickery and said, [...] "As <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> her, I hate her, too, especially after the lies she told the press about the shot between her legs, which was a straight lie". Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, who later befriended the actress, also claimed in his memoir, Hollywood Animal, that the actress was fully aware of the level of nudity involved.|$|E

Aphex Twin was a huge fan of the record: [...] "It was the next step after Chicago acid, and <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> that, <b>I</b> could relate much better to 808 State.
