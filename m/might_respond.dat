5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent <b>might</b> <b>respond,</b> that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E

Beginning July 4, 2014, a sneak peek of the film was presented at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios in the Magic Eye and ABC Sound Studio theaters, respectively. Approximately 14 minutes of the film was screened on July 7, 2014, in IMAX 3D in the United States, and 3D theaters and IMAX 3D in Canada, along with two trailers. The screening was met with positive reviews, praising the humor, the 3D and IMAX conversion, and Cooper's portrayal of Rocket. However, it was criticized for beginning partway through the film, not allowing viewers to easily acclimate to the film's tone, and for how the general audience <b>might</b> <b>respond</b> to a film within the MCU without established characters making appearances.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} aggressive multi-tracking of D'Angelo's voice, {{a technique}} {{similar to the}} production of Sly & the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) and Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On (1973). The multi-tracking on Voodoo significantly affected the clarity of D'Angelo's vocals. In Voodoos liner notes, Saul Williams wrote of its heavy use of multi-tracking, stating [...] "You <b>might</b> <b>respond,</b> 'Lyrics?

Music writers have also noted the production style and sound of Voodoo as reminiscent of the sound of the P-Funk opus Mothership Connection (1975), Gaye's downtempo disco-soul record I Want You (1976), and Miles Davis's jazz fusion works In a Silent Way (1969) and Bitches Brew (1970).|$|E

2500|$|Following each scenario, {{people were}} {{presented}} with two options about how their attachments <b>might</b> <b>respond.</b> One option was [...] "he/she accepts you."

Ratings of likely attachment responses corresponded to people's attachment styles. People with secure attachment styles were more likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, [...] "If I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, then my partner will accept me." [...] People with other attachment styles were less likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, [...] "If I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, then my attachment will reject me." [...] Differences in attachment styles reflected differences in relational schemas. Relational schemas may therefore be used to understand the organization of working models of attachment, as has been demonstrated in subsequent studies.|$|E
2500|$|In V1 {{the simple}} three-color {{segregation}} begins to break down. Many cells in V1 respond to {{some parts of}} the spectrum better than others, but this [...] "color tuning" [...] is often different depending on the adaptation state of the visual system. A given cell that <b>might</b> <b>respond</b> best to long wavelength light if the light is relatively bright might then become responsive to all wavelengths if the stimulus is relatively dim. Because the color tuning of these cells is not stable, some believe that a different, relatively small, population of neurons in V1 is responsible for color vision. These specialized [...] "color cells" [...] often have receptive fields that can compute local cone ratios. Such [...] "double-opponent" [...] cells were initially described in the goldfish retina by Nigel Daw; their existence in primates was suggested by David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel and subsequently proven by Bevil Conway. As Margaret Livingstone and David Hubel showed, double opponent cells are clustered within localized regions of V1 called blobs, and are thought to come in two flavors, red–green and blue–yellow. Red–green cells compare the relative amounts of red–green in one part of a scene with the amount of red–green in an adjacent part of the scene, responding best to local color contrast (red next to green). Modeling studies have shown that double-opponent cells are ideal candidates for the neural machinery of color constancy explained by Edwin H. Land in his retinex theory.|$|E

On 28 September 2012, Netanyahu gave {{a speech to the}} UN General Assembly in which he set forward a [...] "red line" [...] of 90% uranium enrichment, stating that if Iran were to reach this level, it would become an intolerable risk for Israel. Netanyahu used a cartoon graphic of a bomb to illustrate his point, indicating three stages of uranium enrichment, noting that Iran had already completed the first stage, and stating that [...] "By next spring, at most by next summer at current enrichment rates, [...] will have finished the medium enrichment and move on to the final stage. From there, it's only a few months, possibly a few weeks before they get enough enriched uranium for the first bomb." [...] Netanyahu delivered his speech the day after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spoke on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, a presentation that the American, Canadian, and Israeli delegations had deliberately not attended. At the time, according to cables leaked in 2015, Mossad's assessment was that Iran did not appear ready to enrich uranium to levels required for a nuclear bomb.|$|E
2500|$|First, it is {{not clear}} where the {{interaction}} would take place. For example, burning one's finger causes pain. Apparently there is some chain of events, leading from the burning of skin, to the stimulation of nerve endings, to something happening in the peripheral nerves of one's body that lead to one's brain, to something happening in a particular part of one's brain, and finally resulting in the sensation of pain. But pain is not supposed to be spatially locatable. It <b>might</b> be <b>responded</b> that the pain [...] "takes place in the brain." [...] But evidently, the pain is in the finger.
