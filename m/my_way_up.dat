500|$|Dooley {{is not a}} well {{established}} character in the comics, so Whigham created his own background for him, feeling that [...] "Dooley is [...] a political appointee. I think I worked <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> through good hard work." [...] Unlike {{many of the other}} agents, Whigham believes that Dooley does respect Carter, saying [...] "I think he likes her. I think he cares deeply. I'm not sure that he can always show that". When asked whether Dooley's death was what brings Carter and the other SSR agents together, Fazekas said that this was not necessarily the case, as Carter had already begun to earn that herself, but she did feel that it [...] "sort of focuses everyone and affects everyone".|$|E
500|$|Boonen praised Hayman's victory. He {{said that}} Hayman was [...] "the rider nobody was really looking at" [...] {{and that he}} had ridden a [...] "good sprint", {{although}} no one had much energy left by the velodrome; Vanmarcke had faded in the final metres and boxed Boonen in {{at the bottom of the}} track. He stated that he had received a text message on the morning of the race from a doctor who had treated him after he fractured his skull in the 2015 Abu Dhabi Tour; the doctor had said that the day of the race would be the first day that Boonen would be able to get back on his bike. He noted that he [...] "couldn't be unsatisfied" [...] even though he had not won the race. Stannard described the race as [...] "so close yet so far" [...] and thought that he could have managed a better result than his third place had he not attacked in the final kilometres. He said that he was [...] "super happy" [...] to see Hayman win; he also said that there were [...] "two more steps to work <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> now".|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{stressed}} [...] "patience" [...] {{to begin}} the 1988 season, saying, [...] "We can't just go from the bottom to the top in the snap of a finger... Have patience and stick with the Birds and root for the Birds." [...] After the Orioles lost six consecutive games {{to begin the}} 1988 season, Ripken was fired. Several years later, he said, [...] "It {{was very difficult to}} accept. I had been in the organization. I had worked <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> to the big leagues. I spent my life with the Orioles." [...] The move [...] "hurt" [...] and [...] "bothered" [...] Cal Jr., but he worked through it and remained with the team for 13 more seasons, the rest of his career. Billy switched his number from 3 to 7, saying, [...] "I just didn't want to see anybody else wear it." [...] After Hall of Famer Frank Robinson replaced Ripken, the Orioles proceeded to lose 15 more consecutive games to set the record for the longest losing streak to start a season. He finished his managerial record with a record of 68 wins and 101 losses.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Don't you {{remember}} how I always slept in your cot beside you, and how you cried till I came? But girls have no memories at all! Why, I could find <b>my</b> <b>way</b> straight <b>up</b> to that cot this moment, if I was once inside the palace.' ...|$|R
60|$|Well {{it was for}} {{the nobles}} of the court of Okar that John Carter had been disarmed. As it was, a dozen of them felt the weight of my clenched fists, and I had fought <b>my</b> <b>way</b> half <b>up</b> the steps before the throne to which Salensus Oll had carried Dejah Thoris ere ever they could stop me.|$|R
2500|$|When {{writing in}} 2015 {{in his final}} column for Top Gear magazine, he {{credited}} the Shropshire Star as his first outlet as a motoring columnist: [...] "I started small, on the Shropshire Star with little Peugeots and Fiats and worked <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> to Ford Granadas and Rovers until, after about seven years, I was allowed to drive an Aston Martin Lagonda... It was 10 years before I drove my first Lamborghini." ...|$|E
2500|$|Model Leilani Bishop {{is shown}} {{on the cover of}} the album, shot by {{photographer}} Ellen von Unwerth, dressed in beauty pageant attire with a tiara and a bouquet of flowers, with mascara running down her eyes in tears of joy. Courtney Love stated in an interview that she [...] "wanted to capture the look on a woman's face as she's being crowned... this sort of ecstatic, blue eyeliner running, kind of 'I am, I am—I won! I have hemorrhoid cream under my eyes and adhesive tape on my ass, and I had to scratch and claw and fuck <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>up,</b> but I won Miss Congeniality!'" [...] The band logo introduced on the front cover of the album is thought to be modeled after the '90s Mattel Barbie logo. The crown comes from the collection of Connie Parente, a popular Los Angeles based jewelry collector.|$|E
2500|$|... "About a {{month ago}} a society was projected. [...] I {{did not believe in}} it. [...] I had fought <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> to the top, felt secure in my position, and {{believed}} that each manufacturer would accomplish more by being untrammeled.... The name [...] "Webber", with two [...] "bs," [...] "Weber & Co." [...] "Weber Scale," [...] had appeared on a number of bogus pianos, but I did not whine about it or hire a scurilous publication... to tell the world my griefs, as they did.... I found the place where the bogus [...] "Webber" [...] instruments were made, and put a stop to the work. [...] Those of the bogus makers who proved obstinate I handed over to my attorneys... who speedily procured an injunction on the work and recovered judgement. [...] The same law protects my neighbors' rights, and will act as effectually in their case as it did in mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It would amuse me," [...] Aynesworth answered, [...] "and I've come {{a mile or}} so out of <b>my</b> <b>way,</b> {{and given}} <b>up</b> a whole morning to come and see you. Go on! It won't take long!" ...|$|R
60|$|So I {{went and}} was {{conducted}} by Billali, the old chamberlain, for such seemed to be his office, who had been waiting patiently without all this while, back to our rest-house. On <b>my</b> <b>way</b> I picked <b>up</b> Hans, whom I found sitting outside the arch, and found that as usual that worthy had been keeping his eyes and ears open.|$|R
6000|$|... "Follow!" [...] I cried, and at {{the head}} of them groped <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>up</b> the hall, seeking for Quilla. I {{stumbled}} over the dead body of Larico and felt a path round the table. Then suddenly a door {{at the back of the}} hall was thrown open and by the grey light which came through the doorway I perceived the last of the ravishers departing. We scrambled across the dais where the golden chair was overthrown and the embalmed Upanqui lay, a stiff and huddled heap upon his back, staring at me with jewelled eyes.|$|R
2500|$|Rabbitt was {{employed}} as a mental hospital attendant in the late 1950s but, like his father, he fulfilled his love of music by performing at the Six Steps Down club in his hometown. He later won a talent contest and was given an hour of Saturday night radio show time to broadcast a live performance from a bar in Paterson, New Jersey. In 1964, he signed his first record deal with 20th Century Records and released the singles, [...] "Next to the Note" [...] and [...] "Six Nights and Seven Days". Four years later, with $1,000.00 to his name, Rabbitt moved to Nashville where {{he began his career}} as a songwriter. During his first night in the town, Rabbitt wrote [...] "Working <b>My</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Up</b> to the Bottom", which Roy Drusky recorded in 1968. To support himself, Rabbitt worked as a truck driver, soda jerk and fruit picker while in Nashville. He was ultimately hired as a staff writer for the Hill & Range Publishing Company and received a salary of $37.50 per week. As a young songwriter, Rabbitt socialized with other aspiring writers at Wally's Clubhouse, a bar in Nashville; he said that he and the other patrons had [...] "no place else to go." ...|$|E
60|$|And I wended <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the back-stairs, wondrously {{the wiser}} for my inquiries.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurrah! that's the talk!" [...] {{came from}} Larry. [...] "And {{if you stay}} in the army, I'll see what I can do toward working <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> in the navy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are going}} to start this morning," [...] the man said. [...] "I crept in as soon as it became dark last night and made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> close <b>up</b> to them, and I {{gathered}} that they have decided to march this morning on to Wady El Bahr Nile. They could not stay where they were any longer as they had only brought with them sufficient food for the camels for the march to the wady, where they made sure they should find an abundant supply, and having given them a day's rest they were going to push forwards at once to the next wady, where they made certain of finding the fugitives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} very glad to think I didn't, sir. I've been to no small amount of {{personal}} inconvenience for you. I've pushed <b>my</b> <b>way</b> right <b>up</b> to the headspring. I've got the best opinion that's to be had. The best opinion that's to be had just gives you one leer over its spectacles. I guess that look will fix you if you ever get it straight. I've been able to tap, indirectly," [...] Mr. Simmons went on, [...] "the solicitor of your usurping cousin, and he evidently knows something {{to be in the}} wind. It seems your elder brother twenty years ago put out a feeler. So you're not to have the glory of even making them sit up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is worse}} than a wild-cat when her back is up," [...] he said. [...] "Why, when this thing first began, and I told her to beware how she went on with this American, for that I would kill him if he came in <b>my</b> <b>way,</b> she caught <b>up</b> a knife, and if I had not run like a rabbit, she would have stuck me, {{and you know how}} she went on, and drove me out of Montmartre. After that affair I have not dared see her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} seen or heard a soul," [...] I told her. [...] "I have just {{finished}} some work, and I am on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> to the house with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Too late, my dear fellow," [...] a {{voice called}} {{out from the}} {{adjoining}} room. [...] "You see, I have found <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> unannounced--a bad habit, but my profession excuses everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cosy Moments?" [...] said Psmith reflectively. [...] "I {{regret that}} the bright little sheet {{has not come}} <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> to the present. I must seize an early {{opportunity}} of perusing it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{now a new}} fear {{came over}} me. I had little doubt but my papa was safe, but my fear was that he should arrive at home before me and tell the story; in that case I knew my mamma would go half mad with fright, so on I went as quick as possible. I heard no more discharges. When I got half way home, I found <b>my</b> <b>way</b> blocked <b>up</b> by troops. That way or the Boulevards I must pass. In the Boulevards they were fighting, and I was afraid all other {{passages}} might be blocked up [...] . and I should have {{to sleep in a}} hotel in that case, and then my mamma - however, after a long DETOUR, I found a passage and ran home, and in our street joined papa.|$|R

6000|$|... "That is well. The {{house is}} watched on every side. That is why I crawled <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> to it. They may be darned sharp, but they're not quite sharp {{enough to catch}} a Washoe hunter." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>way</b> lay <b>up</b> {{the bald}} {{valley of the}} river, along the march of Vivarais and Gévaudan. The hills of Gévaudan on the right were a little more naked, if anything, than those of Vivarais upon the left, and the former had a {{monopoly}} of a low dotty underwood that grew thickly in the gorges and died out in solitary burrs upon the shoulders and the summits. Black bricks of fir-wood were plastered here and there upon both sides, and here and there were cultivated fields. A railway ran beside the river; the only bit of railway in Gévaudan, {{although there are many}} proposals afoot and surveys being made, and even, as they tell me, a station standing ready built in Mende. A year or two hence and this may be another world. The desert is beleaguered. Now may some Languedocian Wordsworth turn the sonnet into patois: [...] "Mountains and vales and floods, heard YE that whistle?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I crawled {{along for}} some distance. Half {{a dozen times}} they was nigh {{stumbling}} over me as they searched about in the gardens and vineyards; but at last I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> safe <b>up</b> to the convent and rang at the bell. Presently the little window in the door opened, and a monk said, 'Who is there?' I kept out of his sight and said in Spanish: 'A fugitive who seeks sanctuary.' Thinking I was only somebody who had stabbed three or four men in a row, the monk opened the door. He gave an exclamation when he saw my uniform when I entered, and would have slammed the door in my face; but I pushed in. Then he gave a shout, and five or six other monks came running up {{and set up a}} jabbering, and stood staring at me as if I had been a wild beast. Then they wanted to turn me out; but I wouldn't budge, and as I had my sword still in my hand they didn't know what to do.|$|R
60|$|I {{drove to}} the address given me on the paper. It was an odd, half-forgotten street, {{terminating}} in a cul-de-sac, and {{not far from the}} river. The few houses it contained were larger than the majority of those in the neighborhood, but were in a shocking state of repair. The one at which I eventually stopped had a timber yard adjoining, or rather attached to it. I left the taxicab outside, and made <b>my</b> somewhat uncertain <b>way</b> <b>up</b> to the front door. Only a few yards from me a great black dog was straining at his collar and barking furiously. I was somewhat relieved when the door was opened immediately at my knock.|$|R

50|$|After {{a two-month}} break, Comtesse de Loir {{returned}} for a second attempt at the Arc de Triomphe, and started at odds of 21/1 in a twenty-four runner field. Held up by Desaint until the straight, she took the lead from Nobiliary 300 metres from the finish but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third, beaten three lengths and {{two and a half}} lengths by Star Appeal and On <b>My</b> <b>Way.</b> As in the previous year, she had many top class horses behind her including Allez France, Dahlia, Bruni, Card King and Green Dancer. For her last two races, Comtesse de Loir was sent to compete in North America. In late October she ran in the Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racecourse in Toronto and finished second, beaten half a length by the 1974 Epsom Derby winner Snow Knight, who went on to be voted American Champion Male Turf Horse. The filly's last race was the Washington D C International over one and a half miles at Laurel Park Racecourse in which she was opposed by Snow Knight, Dahlia, Nobiliary, Star Appeal and On <b>My</b> <b>Way.</b> Held <b>up</b> by Desaint in the early stages, he produced her usual strong run in the straight but failed to overhaul Nobiliary and finished second, beaten three quarters of a length.|$|R
5000|$|She {{was awarded}} a {{residency}} at the Fondation Cartier in Paris in 1993 and a Paul Hamlyn Award for Visual Artists in 1996. [...] "My way of thinking is very much from Brazil: <b>My</b> <b>way</b> of picking <b>up</b> objects comes from there too. It is something connected with childhood and also with the Brazilian psyche. Our way of thinking is not as linear {{as it is in}} Europe ... In art you obviously have a background in art history. We don't have that in Brazil at all. I think the way we developed our visual sense is different from the European model. I didn't have that. We just do everything in a very empirical way, even art."She died of cancer aged 48.|$|R
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 135. Harvick {{spun the}} tires on the restart and lost {{the lead to}} Kyle Busch. Joey Logano hit the rear of Jimmie Johnson's car and forced him onto the apron. Johnson then made contact with Harvick and damaged his left-rear fender. His left-rear tire blew out and sent his car backwards into the turn 3 wall, bringing out the fourth caution on lap 137. “I {{got a pretty good}} restart and obviously (Joey Logano) and (Johnson) got a run. I just held my line and (Johnson) just slammed into the side of my door,” Harvick explained. [...] "That was pretty much it.” “He didn’t leave me any space,” Johnson explained after the race. “He was pinning me down, and I had to get back up on the track. I wouldn’t say that what he did was any different than other situations I’ve been in like that. When you are in his position, {{you want to get the}} inside car in a bad angle so they have to lift. I was fine with lifting, but I had to get back on the race track, so I worked <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>up</b> on the track.” ...|$|R
