30|$|The {{effects of}} {{adsorbent}} dose, initial pH, dye concentrations and temperature on Basic Blue 16 (BB 16) adsorption by <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clay</b> {{revealed that the}} adsorption rates of the dye were very fast at the initial stages for all the four parameters tested, while it slowed gradually as the equilibrium was approached due to the reduction of available active sites on <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clay.</b> An inverse relationship was observed between BB 16 removal and the adsorbent dosage. The amount of dye adsorbed onto <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clay</b> decreased with increase in adsorbent dose. The adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was maximum at pH 3.6 and further increase in pH resulted in {{a negative effect on}} BB 16 adsorption due to the changes in swelling properties and surface chemistry of clay with pH as corroborated by Gurses et al. 2006 (Gunay et al. 2013).|$|E
30|$|The {{spontaneous}} and feasible nature of BB 16 adsorption by <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clay</b> {{was reflected in}} the negative ∆G° values, as adsorption of BB 16 was more favourable at higher temperatures and lower initial dye concentrations due to higher negative values of ∆G°. The dye molecules were removed from the liquid medium by physisorption. The positive values of ∆S° implied an increase in the degree of dispersion of the adsorbed species. The positive values of ∆H° suggested that adsorption was an endothermic process and that heat was consumed during the adsorption of BB 16 by <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clay,</b> which was also supported by an increase of adsorption capacity with temperature (Gunay et al. 2013).|$|E

Different arrangements of the surfactant molecules in the organo-clays are inferred from the changes in basal spacings.

The effects of pH were studied and the properties ofthe obtained final materials were evaluated with simple model systems of the final application. The modified clays were characterized before and after the intercalation, combining the results ofX-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), whereas the solutions were analysed by means of Chemical Oxygen Demand to quantify the amount of intercalated polymer and by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) to quantify the metal ions concentration.

The obtained solid (i. e. the clays with the OH -Al species in the montmorillonite interlayer) which was called the precursor, was subjected to a thermal treatment up to 1000 ¡ C using DTA-TG for analysis at low temperature. Additionally, the structural changes of the precursor by heating at 1030, 1100 and 1200 ¡ C for 2 hours {{and that of the}} natural clays were examined. The crystallinity and formation of new phases was followed by x-ray diffraction analysis. Mullite and cordierite were originated depending on the different contents of aluminium and magnesium in the structure of natural montmorillonite, respectively, accompanied with other phases. The intercalated OH-Al species in both clays favored the increase in the mullite content in the final products. However, the transformation to this phase was directly related to the octahedral aluminium of the natural clay and thus mullite was found to be the dominant phase from montmorillomite containing higher octahedral Al...|$|R

This fine content was later used to form natural clay–sand mixtures by mixing the fractionized clay portion with sand in varying proportions in increments of 10 % up to 80 % by weight. Three grades of sand were mixed separately with the fractionized clays to form six sets of natural clay–sand series.|$|E
40|$|Determination of the {{swelling}} pressure of <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clays</b> {{is required in}} many situations concerned with stability problems of foundations, retaining walls, slope stability of embankments and excavations in expansive soils. Recently expansive soils such as bentonite {{have been used as}} a mixture backfill material, for example as backfill material for nuclear waste disposal systems, for which a knowledge of {{the swelling}} pressure is desirable. This is the pressure required to keep the clay-water system at the required void ratio when it is allowed to absorb water or electrolyte. If the pressure is less than the swelling pressure, volume expansion occurs; if the pressure is more than the swelling pressure, volume compression occurs. Because of isomorphous substitutions in the crystal lattice, in general the clay particles carry negative charges at the surfaces of the platelets. Exchangeable cations in the clay media are attracted to these negative charges, but this attraction is opposed by the tendency of ions to be distributed. As a result, an electric diffuse double layer is formed (Gouy, 1910) ...|$|R

Sand {{was used in the}} formulations of the unfired clay brick specimens. The formulated clay specimens were treated by moisture and spray techniques until 90 days of curing. The laboratory unfired stabilized clay specimens were identified using X-ray diffraction technique. In addition, physical and mechanical properties were measured according to the Egyptian Standard Specification (ESS) 1234 - 2005 and evaluated in accordance with the Egyptian Code for Building Units (ECP) 204 - 2005 to ensure the quality and impact of the made unfired clay specimens. The quantification of the formed phases demonstrated a detrimental effect of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H), portlandite (Ca(OH) 2) and calcite (CaCO 3) phases in the studied samples. The physico-mechanical results of the specimens cured by the moisture method were higher than those treated by the spray of the same sample. In all cases, the test results suggested that cement amended specimen properties rather than lime. Moreover, as explained from the obtained physico-mechanical properties, calcium hydroxide generated from the hydration of cement is more reactive than that from the hydration of the added lime.

30|$|Clay {{deposits}} {{are widely}} distributed within many geological formations from Carboniferous to recent age. They {{are located in}} the region of Nile Valley and Delta, {{as well as in the}} Western and Eastern Desert of Egypt. Most of these deposits are used for the applications in many ceramic industries, for example, whiteware, refractories, heavy clay products, and Portland cement (Hanna and Stoops 1977; Said 1990; Youssef 2008). Clays are classified according to their particle size, mineral and chemical compositions, and other properties (Grim 1962, 1968; Grimshaw 1971; Norton 1969; Konta 1979, Burst 1991). Many authors indicated that kaolinite-rich clay materials are refractory with a high vitrification range, low plasticity, white-to-buff burning colour and a low-drying and firing shrinkage. Moreover, montmorillonite-rich clays are non-refractory with low vitrification ranges, high plasticity, buff-to-red burning colour, and a high-drying and firing shrinkage. In contrast, illite-rich clays are falling between kaolinitic and <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clays</b> and exhibit wide variations. Lightweight clay aggregates may be produced by firing pellets of low-grade montmorillonite-rich clays with or without adding to the vitrification range. After firing, the clay pellets swell or bloat owing to gas releases within the firing bodies during the liquid phase. On cooling, these low-grade montmorillonite clays conserve the cellular texture, and lightweight aggregate is obtained (Serry et al. 1985; Konta 1995; Karaman et al. 2006; Bernhardt et al. 2013; Ismail et al. 2016, Ismail et al. 2018; Risdanareni et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{stabilization}} of clays {{is commonly used}} to improve unfavorable engineering properties. Though the effects of non-traditional additives on soil improvement have been investigated in recent years, documented research studies on the macro- and micro-level characteristics of problematic clays stabilized by non-traditional additives are fairly limited. The current study examines the time-dependent changes induced in the strength, mineralogy, morphology, molecular and micro-fabric characteristics of <b>montmorillonitic</b> and kaolinitic <b>clays</b> stabilized with a non-traditional calcium-based additive, which is commercially available under the product name SH- 85. The physico-chemical bonding mechanisms induced by the stabilization process were studied at a micro-level using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, such as X-ray diffractometry (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDAX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area analysis and particle size analysis (PSA) using a laser diffraction approach. Unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests were also performed on stabilized specimens at various curing times to examine macro-level characteristics. The UCS test {{results showed that the}} 6 % and 9 % additive content were optimal for <b>montmorillonitic</b> and kaolinitic <b>clays,</b> respectively, with the UCS of both stabilized clays improving significantly after 7 days of curing. This relatively rapid curing reaction process is very advantageous and cost-effective for geotechnical engineering applications. The micro-level study revealed that the calcium-based additive modified the porous network of the stabilized clays.

40|$|In {{previous}} works the mineralogical and physico-chemical properties of crushed brick-lime mortars {{in response to}} stresses, simulating earthquakes or dynamic soil structure interactions, were studied. It was proved that the effective mechanical properties of the mortars {{could be attributed to}} the alkali-silicate reactions occurring at the brick fragment-lime interface. Since the category of the pozzolanic mortars presents a wide spectrum, spanning from the crushed brick to various cementitious mortars, the idea was to study the effectiveness of other hydraulic mortars as well. The Symonos Petra Monastery at Mount Athos was selected for investigation as pilot monument, because in our {{previous works}} it was found to be scientifically sound. The mortars were analysed following a procedure correlating chemical and instrumental analysis to determine CaCo 3 /CaOsil. TA, IR, SEM and EDX were performed and tensile strength and adhesion was measured. The amounts of Ca++ and Mg++ were determined by AAS. Old mortars, from the Arsenal tower (16 th c.) present higher tensile strengths than traditional hydraulic lime mortars and are effective against dynamic stresses exerted onto the greater Serbomacedonian mass as well as against the intense marine environment. Fine ground magnesium-alumino-silicate dust of the <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clays</b> in the area could have been mixed in a ratio of 2 /(1 / 5) of lime/'pozzolanic' or active clay admixtures/inert aggregates reacted with the in situ slaked lime, their hydraulic components augmenting considerably with Mg++.

The investigation was concentrated in two study areas centred on the villages of Phiti (Area 1) and Statos (Area 2), respectively,located in the landslide-prone highlands adjacent to the updomed Troodos Massif. An extensive geotechnical and mineralogical database of over 3000 discrete test data has been established derived from samples collected from surface outcrops, trial pit excavations and borehole drilling programmes in each study area. Geological and detailed landslide mapping was undertaken in each study area resulting in the preparation of two 1 : 10 000 scale engineering geology maps. The maps show that major slope stability problems occur where weak, sheared <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clays</b> and Melange deposits crop out on steep slopes in areas of high relief; with landslide development exacerbated by high winter rainfalls, permeable chalk and limestone caprocks, earthquake shocks and active erosion associated with continued uplift of Troodos. Limited analyses of slope angles and residual shear strength data indicate that limiting slope angles for shallow mass movements in the Kannaviou and Melange clays are c. 8. 5 degrees and 11 degrees, respectively. Deep-seated slope failures are shown to be largely associated with faults.

40|$|The Proterozoic Soldiers Cap Group, {{a product}} of two major magmatic rift phases {{separated}} by clastic sediment deposition, hosts mineralised (e. g. Pegmont Broken Hill-type deposit) and barren iron oxiderich units at three main stratigraphic levels. Evaluation of detailed geological and geochemical features was carried out for one lens of an apatite–garnet-rich, laterally extensive (1. 9 km) example, the Weatherly Creek iron-formation, and it {{was placed in the}} context of reconnaissance studies of other similar units in the area. Chemical similarities with iron-formations associated with Broken Hill-type Pb–Zn deposit iron-formations are demonstrated here. Concordant contact relationships, mineralogy, geochemical patterns and pre-deformational alteration all indicate that the Soldiers Cap Group ironformations are mainly hydrothermal chemical sediments. Chondrite normalised REE patterns display positive Eu and negative Ce anomalisms, are consistent with components of both high-temperature, reduced, hydrothermal fluid (more than or equal to 250 degrees C) and cool oxidised seawater. Major element data suggest a largely mafic provenance for <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clays</b> and other detritus during chemical sedimentation, consistent with westward erosion of Cover Sequence 2 volcanic rocks, rather than local mafic sources. Ni enrichment is most consistent with hydrogenous uptake by Mn-oxides or carbonates. Temperatures inferred from REE data indicate that although they are not strongly enriched, base metals such as Pb and Zn are likely to have been transported and deposited prior to or following iron-formation deposition. Most chemical sedimentation pre-dated emplacement of the major mafic igneous sill complexes present in {{the upper part of the}} basin. Heating of deep basinal brines in a regional-scale aquifer by deep-seated mafic magma chambers is inferred to have driven development of hydrothermal fluids. Three major episodes of extension exhausted this aquifer, but were succeeded by a final climactic extensional phase, which produced widespread voluminous mafic volcanism. The lateral extent of the iron-formations requires a depositional setting such as a sea-floor metalliferous sediment blanket or series of brine pools, with iron-formation deposition likely confined to much smaller fault-fed areas surrounded by Fe–Mn–P-anomalous sediments. These relationships indicate that in such settings, major sulfide deposits and their associated chemical sediment marker horizons need not overlie major igneous sequences. Rather, the timing of expulsion of hydrothermal fluid reflects the interplay between deep-seated heating, extension and magmatism...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Sepiolite {{is seldom}} {{reported}} in playa deposits, {{even though it}} is generally believed to form in a highly saline, alkaline environment. Itsrareness suggests that unusual conditions are necessary for formation of sepiolite. Sepiolite is a major constituent of a near-surface playa bed 4 ft thick in the Amargosa Desert, southern Nye County, Nevada. Associated materials include dolomite and small to trace amounts of quartz, feldspar, montmorillonite, illite, and volcanic glass.

30|$|The way shale {{interacts with}} the {{injected}} fluid depends on shale properties, such as mineralogy, rock mechanical properties, porosity, clay composition and permeability, {{as well as the}} properties of injected fluids such as ionic strength and salt concentration (Gomez and He 2012; Lal 1990; Horsrud et al. 1998). Clay in shale has a great influence on the chemical and mechanical properties of shale. Clay minerals have a tendency to absorb water and cause an increase in the swelling pressure—a phenomenon called hydration, and this is attributed to the hydrophilic surface of the clay (Lu 1988). The clay minerals present in shale are mostly classified into five categories: montmorillonite, illite, smectite, kaolinite and attapulgite (van Olphen 1977; Luckham and Rossi 1999). The presence of abundant clay minerals changes the interaction properties of the shale with injected fluids, and the composition of the clay affects reactivity, with <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clay</b> being highly prone to swelling and high crystalline illite being less prone to swelling.|$|E

TEM results showed the well known formation of silver nanoclusters which give the yellow coloration of the glass. The obtained results showed that clay properties such as specific surface area, pore volume and iron concentration (Fe 2 O 3), are important factors that affect the yellow coloration. It is also observed that Fe 2 O 3 acts as an oxidant agent for silver atoms providing the Ag 2 O formation. This oxide cannot diffuse into the glass structure and avoid the ion-exchanged process. After Ag ion diffusion some structural changes occur in the glass as it has been shown by Raman spectroscopy. It is observed that the diffusion process leads to depolymerization of the glass network as it is determined by analyzing the Qn components of Raman spectra.

Adsorption isotherms obtained were analysed and fitted to the logarithmic form of the Freundlich equation and adsorption coefficients K(f) calculated. Thiazafluron adsorbs on soils, soil clays and model mineral sorbents to a higher extent than the herbicide metamitron due to their different molecular structure. The sorption of both herbicides in clay fractions increases with decreasing solid/solution ratio. The highest K(f) value at high solid/solution ratio for both herbicides is found in a saline soil with its clay fraction predominantly composed of an altered illite mineral which behaves as a montmorillonite. Thiazafluron and metamitron also show the highest adsorption capacity (at low solid/solution ratio) on a predominantly <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clay</b> fraction of low cation exchange capacity (CEC), whereas low adsorption is found on a <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clay</b> fraction of high CEC. The negative influence of the clay CEC is confirmed in adsorption studies on pure clay minerals suspensions. The sorption of both herbicides by soil clays after removing organic matter (OM), shows that contribution of the colloidal OM is very low for thiazafluon, although rather important for metamitron. The influence of the different nature of the OM associated to the clay fractions of diverse soils is suggested. The mineral components of the soil clays, especially expandable layer silicates such as montmorillonite and a type of altered illite, are revealed to be responsible for the adsorption and hence the transport of these polar herbicides by waters in contact with soils or fine-size soil separates. Not only the relative amounts of the organic and inorganic components are important, but also the surface properties and the accessibility of the functional active groups of the herbicide molecule to those surfaces.

40|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{has been}} used to study the changes in the surface properties of a <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clay</b> through the changes in the basal spacings of montmorillonite (SWy- 2) and surfactant-intercalated organo-clays. Variation in the d-spacing was found to be a step-function of the surfactant concentration. High resolution thermogravimetric analysis (HRTG) was used to study the thermal decomposition surfactant modified SWy- 2 -MMTs modified with the surfactant octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. High resolution thermogravimetry shows the decomposition takes place in 4 steps. A mass loss step is observed at room temperature and is attributed to dehydration of adsorption water. A second mass loss step is observed over the 87. 9 to 135. 5 °C temperature range and is also attributed to dehydration of water hydrating metal cations such as Na+. The third mass loss occurs from 178. 9 to 384. 5 °C and is assigned to a loss of surfactant. The fourth mass loss step is ascribed to the loss of OH units through dehydroxylation over the 556. 01 to 636. 35 °C temperature range...|$|E

Mesozoic sediments in the Southern Eromanga Basin reflect {{the change from}} fluvial deposition in the Jurassic to shallow marine deposition {{with the onset of}} an Early Cretaceous transgression. Rocks of the fluvial Algebuckina Sandstone outcrop around Mt. Babbage, in the Northern Flinders Ranges. They consist of several cycles of coarse, pebbly sandstones and conglomerates that fine upwards into well-sorted fine to medium-grained sandstones that are crossbedded throughout and represent a braided stream environment. An upper silicified sandstone contains numerous fossil-wood and leaf impressions which allow correlation of the sequence with those observed elsewhere around the Basin margins. Further out into the Basin, the Algebuckina Sandstone is a well-sorted, fine to medium-grained sandstone that represents an alluvial plain environment. The overlying Cadna-owie Formation forms the transition between this and the marine Bulldog Shale above. Thjs change is reflected in the decrease in grain-size of the sediment and the transition from kaolinite-dominated assemblages in the fluvial sandstones to marine clays of the Bulldog Shale containing predominantly montmorillonite. Most of the material supplied to the Algebuckina Sandstone and Lower Cadna-owie Formation was derived from the Gawler Range Volcano-plutonic Province and the Mt. Painter Province to the south. The occurrence of such a thick sequence of <b>montmorillonitic</b> silts and <b>clays</b> containing high-silica zeolites and authigenic quartz may represent a change to a volcanogenic source. As the terrigenous supply was waning, with the onset of the marine transgression, volcanogenic detritus may have been supplied by a volcanic arc system that was developing to the east. Thesis (B. Sc.

40|$|Analysis of Thematic Mapper data {{acquired}} November 15, 1982, over a vegetated site {{located in}} the East Texas Timberlands and Claypan area of Texas has indicated that <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clay</b> textured soils can be separated from soils with different textures. The difference of TM band 4 (0. 76 - 0. 90 micron) and band 7 (2. 08 - 2. 35 microns) had an agreement of 55. 8 percent with the USDA soil survey for upland clay soils. This compared to 55. 9 -percent agreement when all six bands (excluding the thermal) were used. The disagreement occurred at the boundary lines {{as defined by the}} USDA soil survey and the spectral data. This result is considered to be fairly good, considering the difficulty in placement of soil boundaries by the soil scientist in the field. While the exact influence on the vegetation, and thus the spectral response observed by TM, is not understood at this time, it appears that TM band 7 is responding to the type of mineralogy of the soil and that soil properties important to the plant can be detected using TM...|$|E
40|$|Given a <b>montmorillonitic</b> <b>clay</b> soil at high {{porosity}} and saturated by monovalent counterions, {{we investigate}} the particle level {{responses of the}} clay to different external loadings. As analytical solutions are not possible for complex arrangements of particles, we employ computational micromechanical models (based on {{the solution of the}} Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations) using the finite element method, to estimate counterion and electrical potential distributions for particles at various angles and distances from one another. We then calculate the disjoining pressures using the Van't Hoff relation and Maxwell stress tensor. As the distance between the clay particles decreases and double-layers overlap, the concentration of counterions in the micropores among clay particles increases. This increase lowers the chemical potential of the pore fluid and creates a chemical potential gradient in the solvent that generates the socalled 'disjoining' or 'osmotic' pressure. Because of this disjoining pressure, particles do not need to contact one another in order to carry an 'effective stress'. This work may lead towards theoretical predictions of the macroscopic load deformation response of montmorillonitic soils based on micromechanical modelling of particles...|$|E
