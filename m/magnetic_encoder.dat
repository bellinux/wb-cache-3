In case of 0.33  m/s, the foot mostly follows the commanded trajectory. However, in case of 1.2  m/s there is big errors especially while the transition between support phase and swing phase where right and left edge of the trajectory. The reason of these errors are considered as error of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>encoder</b> which is used for joint control. Since <b>magnetic</b> <b>encoder</b> has internal averaging function to output stable value, when the joint rotates fast, it outputs different value to actual joint angle position. Therefore, because of this <b>magnetic</b> <b>encoder</b> averaging issue, we were getting inaccurate feedback for the PID controller at high rotational speed. Then, when setting a commanded angle position to the joint, the output position exceeded the commanded position, resulting in {{a difference between the}} commanded foot position and the foot position measured by the motion capture system as shown in Fig.  17. However, since the measured stride exceeds commanded stride and its error to commanded stride is 11  %, we consider the robot can walk at target velocity or more.|$|E
40|$|This thesis project aims to help {{complete}} the fabrication of a <b>magnetic</b> wheel <b>encoder</b> for {{a fleet of}} autonomous electric vehicles that will provide shuttle service across MIT's campus. Currently no self-driving vehicles exist for such a function, especially for mobility on a college campus. In an effort to assist the system's simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, this <b>magnetic</b> wheel <b>encoder</b> was designed and implemented to more accurately and directly determine the vehicle's trajectory. After mounting the magnets and sensors, an algorithm was developed to map the vehicle's path given raw magnetic field data.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design of, and results from, a calibration system for optical linear displacement- (shadow-) sensors. The shadow-sensors {{were designed to}} detect ‘Violin-Mode’ (VM) resonances in the 0. 4 mm diameter silica fibre suspensions of the test-masses / mirrors of advanced LIGO gravitational wave interferometers. Each sensor illuminated the fibre under test, so as to cast its narrow shadow onto a ‘synthesized split photodiode’ detector, the shadow falling over adjacent edges of the paired photodiodes. The apparatus described here translated a vertically orientated silica test fibre horizontally through a collimated Near InfraRed illuminating beam, whilst simultaneously capturing the separate DC ‘shadow notch’ outputs {{from each of the}} paired split photodiode detectors. As the ratio of AC to DC photocurrent sensitivities to displacement was known, a calibration of the DC response to quasi-static shadow displacement allowed the required AC sensitivity to vibrational displacement to be found. Special techniques are described for generating the required constant scan-rate for the test-fibre using a DC motor-driven stage, for removing ‘jitter’ at such low translation rates from a linear <b>magnetic</b> <b>encoder,</b> and so for capturing the two shadow-notch signals at each micrometre of the test-fibre’s travel. Calibration, across the four detectors of this work, gave a vibrational responsivity in voltage terms of (9. 45 ± 1. 20) MV (rms) / metre (rms), yielding a VM displacement sensitivity of (69 ± 13) picometres (rms) / √Hz, at 500 Hz, over the required measuring span of ± 0. 1 mm...|$|E

40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2015 The {{problem that}} the Michigan Formula SAE Racing Team would like to solve is how to reduce tire slip in straight-line {{acceleration}} situations. Solving this will result in faster acceleration times and more points in the competition. As per the sponsor’s request, the solution will be approached through the implementation of clutch-control, a form of launch control using a closed-loop system. The main user requirements of the project include generating at least 10 ft-lbs of torque, avoiding bending moment damage with a safety factor of 1. 2, disassembling the system from the vehicle within 20 minutes, and creating a high speed system that can adjust the clutch within. 02 seconds. These specifications were used to choose the AmpFlow A 28 - 150 High Performance motor along with the MAE 3 Absolute <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Encoder</b> Kit for the final design. A proof-of-concept electrical circuit that is connected to a small DC motor has been built that allows the system to drive current from the power source and protect the motor from backwards flowing current by implementing an opto-isolator.

40|$|Aim Lower {{leg length}} (LLL) gives a more {{accurate}} estimate of short-term linear growth than total body length as it is less influenced by measuring error. The aim of this work was to construct reference values for LLL in healthy Chinese infants {{during the first year}} of life. Material and Methods Seventy-one Hong Kong born healthy full-term Chinese infants were studied every second month from birth to one year of age. LLL was measured by means of the hand-held knemometer (manufactured by the FORCE Institute, Denmark), LLL is was estimated by the means of a pair of electronic callipers which automatically recorded the measurement when the pressure applied on the heel reached a preset value. The measuring system is based on a <b>magnetic</b> <b>encoder</b> with a resolution of 0. 01 mm. Five sequential measurements were performed and the result of the measurement sequence was expressed as the average of the last four measurements. Results The mean and SD of LLL were computed at the different ages between birth and one year of age (both sexes pooled); both estimates were fitted by a second degree polynomial function: mean= 125. 724 + 13 0291 *t- 1. 05321 *t 2 + 0. 041012 *t 3 SD= 3. 67018 + 0. 85278 *t- 0. 092090 *t 2 + 0. 0038488 *t 3 where t is age in years The mean values were similar to the mean values of Danish infants being followed between birth and six months of age, but the SD values were higher in the Danish series. In our study the boys had on the average significantly higher LLL values than girls; 0. 35 SDS in comparison with - 0. 35 SDS based on our gender combined reference standard (t test, p< 0. 05 for all ages). At this stage we present the pooled data results for comparison with the Danish study. Conclusion This is the first report on LLL reference values between birth and one year of age in normal infants. Our mean LLL values was similar to the values reported in Danish infants during the first 6 months of life implying no ethnic group differences for this body measurement. The reference values would be useful in metabolic and nutritional studies of different patient groups.

40|$|On this project, a modi cation {{of an open}} source, 3 D printed robot, was implemented, {{with the}} purpose {{to create a more}} a ordable bipedal {{platform}} proper for studying Bipedal Walking algorithms. The original robot is a part of an open-source platform, called Poppy, that is formed from an interdisciplinary community of beginners and experts. One of the robots of this platform, is the Poppy Humanoid. The rigid parts of the Poppy Humanoid (as well {{as the rest of the}} Poppy platform robots) are 3 D printed, a key factor of lowering the cost of a robot. The actuators used though, are expensive commercial DC-motors that increase the total cost of the robot drastically. This high cost of the actuators of Poppy, led this project to modify cheaper actuators while maintaining the same performance of their predecessors. Taking apart the components of the cheaper actuator, only the motor, the gears and the case that host them were kept, and a new design was made to control the motor and to meet the requirements set from the commercial motors. This new design of the actuator include a 12 -bit resolution <b>magnetic</b> <b>encoder</b> to read the position of the shaft of the motor, a driver to run the motor, and also an embedded Arduino micro-controller. This feature of an Arduino as part of the actuator, gives the advantage over the commercial motor, as the user has the freedom to upload his own codes and to implement his own motor controllers. The result is a fully programmable actuator hosted on the same motor case. The size of this actuator though, is di erent from the commercial one. In order to mount the new actuators to the platform, Joan Guasch designed proper 3 D printed parts. Apart of these parts, Joan also modi ed the leg design, in order to add another joint on the ankle (roll) as this Degree of Freedom (DoF) is important for Bipedal Walking algorithms and was missing from the original Poppy Humanoid leg design. The modi ed robot, is called Poppy-UPC and is a 12 DoF biped platform. For the communication between the motors and the main computer unit, a serial communication protocol was implemented based to the RS- 485 standard. Multiple receivers (motors and sensors) can be connected to such a network in a linear, multi-drop con guration. The main computer unit of Poppy-UPC is an Odroid-C 1 board. Essentially, this board is a Quad-core Linux computer fully compatible to run ROS. Odroid is acting as the master of the network and is gathering all the informations of the connected nodes, in order to publish them in ROS-topics. That way, the Poppy-UPC is connected to the ROS environment and ROS packages can be used for any further implementation with this platform.

40|$|Abstract- The {{development}} process of a pneumatic powered motion seat is being outlined {{as an example}} for mechatronic design. The fluid muscle of Festo AG provides stick slip free motion and is being used as displacement and pressure controlled actuator in a hexapod system for the first time. The process of design is supported by 3 D-CAD with the software tool SolidEdge. It provides the necessary data to use Rigid Body Simulation with the software tool CAMeLView. Actuator behaviour is acquired by using a test bench with similar environment to the designed application. An 80486 process controller system with modular periphery called PS- 1 made by Beck-IPC is beeing used. The programming is done by defining the control structure in a block oriented simulation environment followed by automated C++ code generation and compilation for the DOS 6. 22 operating system. The displacement control of the fluid muscle was possible due {{to the development of}} an incremental in-tube length measuring system. For this purpose the miniaturized <b>magnetic</b> linear <b>encoder</b> system had to be integrated into the membrane of the actuator. By using a six-actuator structure it is possible to move a person in the seat in three translatorical directions as well as three rotatorical orientations – all six degrees of freedom are available respective limited working ranges. By using the inverse transformation formalism for hexapod structures only forward position control of the motion seat is available. It is scheduled to implement the hexapod forward transformation to calculate the seat position and orientation in real-time in order to improve the control accuracy.

40|$|This {{project was}} carried out during spring 2016 in {{collaboration}} with BOSCH Rexroth, Mellansel, and aimed to investigate the possibility of implementing a converter {{with the ability to}} scale incremental pulse resolution and also convert the velocity to a 4 - 20 mA current loop reference. An investigation on how a fault tolerance mechanism could be implemented to increase the dependability of the encoder was done and the out-coming results were implemented. The software and hardware were revised and optimized to facilitate a future encapsulation, and still keep the converter reprogrammable. A background study was performed during 8 continuous weeks to acquire enough knowledge about possible conversion techniques, to nally derive these down to two for further testing. The nal conversion algorithms were multiplication and extrapolation techniques, which would be utilized to scale the pulse signal. The background study also involved writing ecient c code and a general study about fault tolerance. With the information from the background study, two algorithms were implemented on a specially designed hardware platform. Tests were designed from the requirements given from Bosch and these were performed at a test rig with a <b>magnetic</b> ring <b>encoder</b> connected to dSPACE control desk. A converter that met the criteria was designed and implemented. The test results showed that the most successful algorithm implemented was the multiplication algorithm, optimized with adaptive resolution, which decreases the input update rate with increasing speed. Although extrapolation caused more noiseand also a static error on the signal, this is the one leaving most room for future optimizations. Dependability means were implemented which stops the converter from outputting erroneous pulses, and also to reboot the software in case of invalid inputs. Whether this made the converter fail-safe or not is dicult to tell since fail-safe is a vague term and applies di erent for each situation. It was concluded that the implemented fault tolerance mechanism worked though. The software and hardware were designed so reprogramming is possible even though the component is casted. This particular function was not tested since the development board did not provide access to the required pins. Detta projekt genomfordes under varen 2016 i samarbete med Bosch Rexroth i Mellansel. Syftet var att undersoka mojligheten att implementera en konverterare med mojligheten att steglost skala encodersignaler med olika pulstal, samt konvertera detta till en 4 - 20 mA stromsignal. En utredning om hur felsakerheten skulle kunna forbattras pa konverteraren gjordes och resultaten fran undersokningen implementerades. Mjukvaran och hardvaran reviderades och optimerades for hur denna skulle kunna gjutas in for att klara industrins harda inkapslingskrav men samtidigt vara mojlig att programmera om. En bakgrundsstudie utfordes underatta veckor for att tillgodose tillracklig kunskap om konverteringsalgoritmer for att komma fram till tva stycken for implementation. De slutgiltiga konverteringsalgoritmerna som togs vidare till implementation och testning blev multiplikation och extrapolering av pulstider. Forstudien omfattade aven hur skrivande av e ektiv c kod kan goras da hog hastighet och upplosning kraver mycket berakning av processorn, och en bakgrundsstudie om felsakerhet i elektroniska system. Testfall designades for att testa onskade egenskaper och gransvarden for konverteringarna och dessa utfordes pa en testrig med en magnetencoder uppkopplad mot dSPACE Control Desk. En konverterare, vilket inte kunde hittas i bakgrundsstudien, designades och implementerades. Testresultaten visade att den mest framgangsrika algoritmen i dessa tester var multiplikationen med en adaptiv upplosning vilken reducerar antalet matpunkter pa insignalen vid hogre hastigheter.
