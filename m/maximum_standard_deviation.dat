40|$|Abstract — The {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) {{compression method}} {{presented in this}} paper is based on ASCII character encoding. In this compression methodology, at first individual <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of each part of the signal is calculated. For the region of high deviation, local maxima are extracted. To achieve a strict lossless compression in regions of high <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> and a tolerable lossy compression in rest of the signal, two different compression algorithms have been developed. The compression algorithm has been evaluated with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database which revealed that this proposed algorithm can reduce the file size significantly with almost negligible loss of information. By using the reversed logic for reconstruction the data can be reconstructed preserving the significant ECG signal morphology.

40|$|AbstractAimIn {{measuring}} exit fluences, {{there are}} several sources of deviations which include {{the changes in the}} entrance fluence, changes in the detector response and patient orientation or geometry. The purpose of this work is to quantify these sources of errors. BackgroundThe use of the volumetric modulated arc therapy treatment with the help of image guidance in radiotherapy results in high accuracy of delivering complex dose distributions while sparing critical organs. The transit dosimetry has the potential of Verifying dose delivery by the linac, Multileaf collimator positional accuracy and the calculation of dose to a patient or phantom. Materials and methodsThe quantification of errors caused by a machine delivery is done by comparing static and arc picket fence test for 30 days. A RapidArc plan, created for the pelvis site was delivered without and with Rando phantom and exit portal images were acquired. The day to day dose variation were analysed by comparing the daily exit dose images during the course of treatment. The gamma criterion used for analysis is 3 % dose difference and 3 mm distance to agreement with a threshold of 10 % of maximum dose. ResultsThe <b>maximum</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> for the static and arc picket fence test fields were 0. 19 CU and 1. 3 CU, respectively. The delivery of the RapidArc plans without a phantom shows the <b>maximum</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 1. 85 CU and the maximum gamma value of 0. 59. The maximum gamma value for the RapidArc plan delivered with the phantom was found to be 1. 2. The largest observed fluence deviation during the delivery to patient was 5. 7 % and the <b>maximum</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> was 4. 1 CU.
