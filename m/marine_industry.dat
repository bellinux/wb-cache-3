5|$|In July 2012, Governor Dannel Malloy {{announced}} that 5 weekend round trips would {{be extended to}} New London beginning in April 2013. However, the extension was dependent on ongoing negotiations with the <b>marine</b> <b>industry</b> over mandated closings of the Old Saybrook – Old Lyme bridge. Two weekday midday trips were added in May 2013, while weekend service began on June 1, 2013, after the application for additional bridge closings {{was approved by the}} state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Because Shore Line East service to New London is limited, Amtrak honors monthly Shore Line East passes on select intercity trains between New London and New Haven.|$|E

25|$|Galvanic {{corrosion}} {{occurs when}} two different metals have physical or electrical contact {{with each other}} and are immersed in a common electrolyte, or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations. In a galvanic couple, the more active metal (the anode) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal (the cathode) corrodes at a slower rate. When immersed separately, each metal corrodes at its own rate. What type of metal(s) to use is readily determined by following the galvanic series. For example, zinc is often used as a sacrificial anode for steel structures. Galvanic corrosion is of major interest to the <b>marine</b> <b>industry</b> and also anywhere water (containing salts) contacts pipes or metal structures.|$|E

25|$|In a next stage, a large 'point park' of 4.25 ha {{is to be}} {{developed}} on Wynyard Point, with another park strip along {{the east side of}} Wynyard Wharf. This larger design followed wide public complaints in 2006 about the new development being dominated by apartments. The layout of the park is also to be decided via an international design competition, and would leave space for a so far unidentified landmark public building. The park would include about 2.4km of waterfront access, and would be linked with Victoria Park via a 40 m wide tree-lined boulevard and a NZ$5 million pedestrian bridge. This work would likely take place between 2014 and 2017, after commercial leases in the area run out. Other areas in the Western Reclamation will remain set aside for <b>marine</b> <b>industry,</b> with the main bulk of land being developed as apartments, with some associated smaller-scale retail and entertainment areas.|$|E

500|$|Kinne Cemetery, {{also known}} as the Glasgo Cemetery and Old Kinne Burying Ground, is a {{historic}} cemetery in Jarvis Road in Griswold, Connecticut. The earliest marked stone is for Daniel Kinne who died in 1713. In the 1930s, the inscriptions of 79 stones in the Kinne Cemetery were recorded for the Hale Index. There are around 80 fieldstones with no carving or identification, but it is unknown if this stems from wearing of the gneiss stone or that there were no skilled carvers locally available. The seven carvers that have been identified are Lebbeus Kimball, Jotham Warren, Josiah Manning, Peter Barker, Mr. Huntington of Lebanon, E. Marston of Mystic Bridge and O. Doty of Stonington. The National Historic Register of Places nomination notes, [...] "the cemetery is significant artistically because the carving on the stones gives many good examples of the funerary art that was characteristic of the 18th and 19th centuries in New England." [...] The cemetery is notable because of the burial of Isaac C. Glasko, the namesake of the village of Glasgo, and a prominent African American land-holding man who ran a blacksmith shop that was important to the <b>marine</b> <b>industry</b> of the area. The cemetery was made apart of the Connecticut Freedom Trail in 1995 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 12, 2001.|$|E

2500|$|The Late-2000s {{recession}} had {{an extreme}} {{impact on the}} sport <b>marine</b> <b>industry.</b> Job losses and cutbacks affected discretionary recreational spending more than most market segments. New boat sales were nil, so manufacturers cut their sponsorships. Some fisherman were forced {{to give up their}} boat ownership or team up with friends to save expenses. The tournament had not covered [...] expenses since 2004 and had spent $200,000 of their reserve fund to compensate, so in 2009 the board of directors made drastic changes to daily activities to ensure the future of the event. Two paid positions, an executive director and assistant were both eliminated to save over $90K per year. Bob Gipson, one of the tournament founders, resigned from the board of directors and assumed the executive director position at no salary. He then examined virtually every facet of the operation to reduce expenses.|$|E
