40|$|Low {{back pain}} is a {{prevalent}} problem afflicting approximately 80 % {{of the population}} during their lives. Subjects with back pain demonstrate deficits in trunk proprioception. Spinal manipulation is a treatment with known effects in pain control, increased motion and other neurophysiological effects. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the treatment effects of spinal manipulation on trunk proprioception in subjects with chronic low back pain (CLBP) and to determine if those effects lasted one week. Thirty-three subjects with CLBP, aged 24 - 54 years participated in this unbalanced, randomized controlled crossover design. Subjects presented for two or three testing sessions and agreed to a general physical examination followed by proprioception testing with joint position sense (JPS), threshold to detect passive motion (TTDPM), direction of motion (DM) and force reproduction (FR). After proprioception testing, each subject received either a lumbar manipulation or a sham procedure followed by retesting of proprioception. This procedure was repeated the following week using the opposite treatment. Those subjects receiving spinal manipulation in the second session returned for a third session and received the sham procedure a second time. Spinal manipulation produced a significant effect for TTDPM in the <b>Manip</b> 1 st Group, the sham procedure produced a significant immediate effect for JPS in the Sham 1 st Group, and manipulation resulted in a significant one-week residual effect for the <b>Manip</b> 1 st Group. All other time comparisons were not significant. The results of this study minimally support the proposed hypotheses. The results of this study suggest that spinal manipulation has minimal effect on trunk proprioception in subjects with CLBP who are painfree at the time of testing. Subjects in this study did not demonstrate as large a deficit in proprioception as previously reported. This study might suggest that a lack of demonstrable deficit in painfree subjects at the time of testing is the result of diminished pain level. Strong conclusions cannot be made from these results but suggest further testing comparing manipulation with no intervention or other interventions while controlling for pain level, may be important for understanding the functional implications of the neurophysiological effect of spinal manipulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{circadian}} rhythm of locomotor activity in hamsters maintained in either constant darkness or constant light can be phase-shifted {{by a single}} injection of the short-acting benzo diazepine, triazolam. These results suggest that treatment with triazolam may also alter the entrainment pattern of {{circadian rhythm}}s in animals that are synchronized to a light-dark (LD) cycle. To test this hypothesis, hamsters maintained on an LD 6 : 18 light cycle received daily injections of triazolam (or vehicle) for 10 - 12 days, and any subsequent effects on the phase relationship between the onset of activity and the LD cycle were determined. Daily injections of triazolam (but not vehicle) induced pronounced advances or delays in the phase relationship between the entrained activity rhythm and the LD cycle; {{the direction of the}} shift was dependent on the time of the injection.

Our results are expressed in Fourier-Laplace space as infinite continued fractions, which are concisely stated and easily employed {{in a wide range}} of problems involving semiflexible polymers that oppose twist deformation. We then apply our results to the J-factor or ring-closure probability of DNA. As our results are exact (i. e. non-perturbative), we find a measurable difference between the J-factor calculated from our results and approximate, perturbative theory; the error in the approximate theory stems in part from the absence of non-trivial topoisomers that are accounted for in our exact treatment. All organisms are composed of polymeric materials, and many of the polymer constituents are semiflexible at length scales relevant to their biological function. For example, the manip-ulation of DNA includes reading the basepair sequence at the Angstrom length scale where the chain appears rigid, forming loops in gene regulatory elements at tens to hundreds of nanome-ters where the chain appears somewhat malleable, and packaging the meter-long genome in the micron-sized nucleus where the chain appears flexible.

It is assumed that membrane traversal is preceded by unfolding of ricin A-chain, followed by refolding in the cytosol to generate the native, biologically active toxin. Here we describe biochemical and biophysical analyses of the unfolding of ricin A-chain and its refolding in vitro. We show that native ricin A-chain is surprisingly unstable at pH 7. 0, unfolding non-cooperatively above 37 degrees C to generate a partially unfolded state, This species has conformational properties typical of a molten globule, and cannot be refolded to the native state by <b>manip</b> ulation of the buffer conditions or {{by the addition of}} a stem-loop dodecaribonucleotide or deproteinized Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA, both of which are substrates for ricin A-chain.

40|$|It is {{a common}} goal in the {{development}} of feature-based design systems to support users with extended facilities, such as comprehensive semantically correct feature-based models, conformability of tools to user requirements and to different applications, and communication via standardzed interfaces. However, {{the current state of the}} art in feature-based design does not meet the most of these requirements, particularly the integration of design, reliability and maintainability of constraints. This paper presents recent research on design by features using the constraint satisfaction approach. We determine the basic requirements for defining and administering constraints in feature-based models and propose an architecture for consistency management in feature-based design systems. The two main modules of interest are Feature Frame and Consistency Manager. The Feature Frame intends to enclose different feature data into one information set, called Feature Resources and to create and <b>manip</b> ulate such resources using Feature Mechanisms. The Consistency Manager provides functionality for definition, evaluation and satisfaction of constraints in feature-based models. Furthermore, in this paper the relation between feature-based design, consistency management and object-oriented paradigm is clarified. In contrast to previous publications where features and constraints are associated with objects in a programming language sense, our starting point is the ontological view to the object concept. We advocate that features and constraints are not objects themselves, but attributes and laws assigned by us to objects to describe properties of them. Thus, feature-based design can be characterized as the art of defining and manipulating properties of design objects...|$|E

In addition to realism, other important issues include how tractable problems are that can be formulated in the environment, how easy agent performance can be measured, and whether the environment can be customized or extended for specific research questions. In the ideal environment, researchers can pose realistic but tractable problems to an agent, measure and evaluate its performance, and iteratively rework the environment to explore increasingly ambitious questions, all at a reasonable cost in time and effort.

Ecological and sexual sel ection are thought to contribute to this ongoing speciation process, but genetic differentiation remains low. However, recent work in visual pigment genes, opsins, has shown more diversity. Unlike neighboring Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika, Lake Victoria is highly turbid, resulting in a long wavelength shift in the light spectrum with increasing depth, providing an environmental gradient for exploring divergent coevolution in sensory systems and colour signals via sensory drive. Pundamilia pundamila and Pundamilia nyererei are two sympatric species found at rocky islands across southern portions of Lake Victoria, differing in male colouration and the depth they reside.

Adopting an academic–fan (‘aca–fan’) position and using textual analysis, the thesis argues that slash manips represent an important sub-genre of slash deserving of close reading. The thesis is organised into two parts: theory and practice. Part I involves theorisation on the practice, with particular emphasis on composition and value of the form. The compositional strategies of particular well-known (or ‘Big Name Fan’) slash <b>manip</b> artists are examined. These artists’ works and practices become a means of exploring both {{the nature of the}} form — with respect to pornography and art — as well as its value in terms of the questions it raises with respect to: male representations; taboos of the body and its misuse; and the appropriation of character that occurs when popular protagonists are repositioned into pornographic, homosexual embraces. Part II analyses slash manips inspired by the BBC’s Arthurian television series Merlin (2008 – 2012), which is popular among slash fans. The chapters of Part II attend to different slash pairings and queer possibilities in the cult series, while also commenting on the nature and crafting of slash manips. Queer metaphors of secrecy, armour and masks are used as structuring devices for the chapters of Part II.

40|$|Non-operative {{treatment}} for lumbar disc herniation and associated radiculopathy – clinical reasoning and rationale {{for a specific}} physiotherapy intervention Wim Dankaerts, PhD, PGDip <b>Manip</b> Ther, BSc (Physio), Musculoskeletal Research Unit, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Faculty of Kinesiology and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Leuven, Tervuursevest 101, B- 3001 Leuven wim. dankaerts@faber. kuleuven. be Intervertebral lumbar disc herniation is a common disorder presenting with low back pain and/or involving nerve root radiculopathy. Despite an abundant literature {{there is still a}} controversy concerning the conservative treatment of lumbar disc herniation and associated symptoms (radiculopathies) in the absence of true neurological deficit. These are some of the questions that we attempt to answer during this invited presentation: “Lumbar disc herniation …where is the pain coming from? What is the natural history of lumbar disc herniation and/or radiculopathy? Do herniated disc have the potential for spontaneous regression? Does potential regression coincide with the improvement of associated symptoms? Should (specialized) physiotherapist treat patients with a lumbar IVD lesion and/or associated symptoms? If so, what clinical information is needed? What diagnostic tests should be performed? What imaging studies would be most helpful? How do we clinically evaluate for possible nerve root irritation or compression? What is the effect of loading on the lumbar disc through abnormal or unchanging posture, repetitive activities that stress predominantly flexion? How should we evaluate this clinically? How should be determined whether to continue to treat a patient with a suspected IVD lesion? When should the patient be referred for a surgical opinion? Conclusion It should be clear from this overview of ‘questions & answers’ that, in the absence of progressive neurological deficit (cauda equina syndrome and severe motor deficits) for lumbar disc herniation and/or associated radiculopathy, conservative treatment is the first line of treatment. Extensive clinical examination and reasoning is essential to direct specific intervention addressing the underlying mechanism driving the lumbar pain disorder. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Musculoskeletal pain {{disorder}} (MSD) is {{a common}} cause for long-term work absenteeism among {{both women and men}} in the western world, including the Nordic countries. Musicians represent a profession highly afflicted with pain disorders, especially the areas of the neck, shoulder, arm, hand and the upper and lower back. During the last decades an abundant amount of research has reported associations between MSD and motor control disturbances. Common findings include altered neuromuscular coordination and reduced movement precision, as well as reduced strength, endurance and mobility. These disturbances can be of importance for recurrence and duration of the disorders, but also for work ability. Presumably, this can be of specific significance, with risk for absenteeism among professions with high demands on motor control. Musicians are highly dependent on fine motor control, such as fast and accurate finger movements, as well as postural and muscular endurance. Although the amount of research on motor control in pain disorders is extensive, only a few studies have investigated sensorimotor functions among musicians with musculoskeletal pain disorders. Altered posture has been reported, where one study reported dysfunction of the postural stability systems of the low back, shoulder and neck among musicians with playing related disorders (1). However, this study lacked an asymptomatic control group. A couple of studies have reported increased sensorimotor disturbances of the hand and arm among music students with symptoms compared to asymptomatic controls (2, 3). A few studies have investigated muscle activity of superficial neck-shoulder muscles in musicians with neck pain while playing the violin or viola, but the results are incoherent reporting both increased and reduced muscle activity, e. g. (4, 5). Taken together, altered motor control appears to be a concern for musicians with playing related MSD. There is, though, a need for further investigation into motor control functioning among musicians and the association with MSD, especially whilst playing musical instrument. Increased insights in this area can be of important value for prevention and rehabilitation strategies. References 1. Steinmetz A et al.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Myofascial pain may be {{considered}} one of the most common clinical findings in patients with neck pain (NP). Motor aspects of myofascial pain include disturbed motor function and muscle weakness secondary to motor inhibition, muscle stiffness, and restricted range of motion (ROM). Currently, it is unclear which interventions may have the greatest immediate impact on pressure pain sensitivity and ROM. Several studies have demonstrated improved pressure pain thresholds (PPT) after cervical manipulation; however, it is not clear if manipulation targeted to the cervicothoracic (CT) junction will have a similar effect. Others recommend stretching as a method to reduce muscle soreness; however, the immediate effects of passive stretching to the upper trapezius on PPT and ROM have not been studied. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the influence of CT manipulation and passive stretching to the upper trapezius on PPT and ROM in individuals without recent complaint of NP. Subjects: Ninety (90) subjects without current complaint of NP were enrolled into the study. Methods: PPT was assessed on both the right and left upper trapezius musculature. Cervical range of motion (CROM) was assessed in the frontal, sagittal, and transverse planes. Subjects were randomized into one of three groups for intervention (CT manipulation, passive upper trapezius stretching, or control). CROM was reassessed immediately after the intervention. PPT levels were reassessed at 5 and 10 minutes post intervention by a blinded examiner. Mean and standard deviations for PPT and ROM were calculated. Repeated measures two-way ANOVA was used to assess within group (pre- and post- treatment) differences as well as difference among treatment conditions (Control, CT <b>Manip,</b> and Stretch groups). Post-hoc one-way ANOVA tests were used to examine the effects of group assignment/time points in the event of significant interactions between time and group assignment. Statistical significant was set at p 3 ̆c 0. 05. Results: The two-way ANOVA test showed that there was a significant interaction between time and group assignment for CROM in the sagittal and transverse planes, however the post-hoc comparisons did not reveal a significant difference among 3 treatment group or among 3 time points. ANOVA also showed that there was not a difference in frontal plane CROM between time and group assignment. Similarly, although the two-way ANOVA test revealed a significant interaction between time and group assignment for PPT, post-hoc analyses showed that there was no difference between the 3 groups or among 3 time points for either side of the upper trapezius. Discussion: No significant difference in any plane of motion CROM or PPT pre-treatment to post-treatment between treatment groups brings into question the cause of the improved measures with time. Trends found with increased CROM and PPT over time are clouded by increased measures in the control group. The need for further research exists to better understand the relationship between CT manipulation and upper trapezius stretching and their effects on pain pressure thresholds and CROM. Conclusion: Upper trapezius stretching and CT manipulation may both be viable options for treatment by improving CROM and increasing PPT. Further high powered studies focusing on reducing the learning effects between measures and lowering participant uneasiness with research methods could produce clearer results...|$|E
