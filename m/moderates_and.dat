As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside. Both of these replacements were political <b>moderates</b> <b>and</b> prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield's {{re-election}} {{victory for}} governor in 1962 and successful Senate campaign in 1966 made him something of a national figure. In 1968, Hatfield was on Richard Nixon's short list for vice president, and received the strong backing of his friend, the Rev. Billy Graham. Hatfield was considered too liberal by many conservatives and Southern <b>moderates,</b> <b>and</b> Nixon chose the more centrist Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew. Hatfield would later find himself at odds with Nixon over Vietnam and other issues, including a threat by Hatfield to reduce funding for the White House's legal department in 1973 during the Watergate Scandal, after Nixon had failed to use funds appropriated for renovating dams on the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} tumultuous primary {{election}} seasons ever began as the Tet Offensive was launched, followed by the withdrawal of President Johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly in the New Hampshire primary; it concluded with the assassination {{of one of the}} Democratic candidates, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, just moments after his victory in the California primary. On the Republican side, Nixon's main opposition was Michigan Governor George Romney, though New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention. Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot. He selected Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern <b>moderates</b> <b>and</b> Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the many}} studies documenting {{cerebral}} white matter microstructural alterations associated with very preterm birth (< 32 weeks’ gestation), {{there is a}} dearth of similar research in <b>moderate</b> <b>and</b> late preterm infants (born 32 – 36 weeks’ gestation), who experience higher rates of neurodevelopmental delays than infants born at term (≥ 37 weeks’ gestation). We therefore aimed to determine whether whole brain white matter microstructure differs between <b>moderate</b> <b>and</b> late preterm infants and term-born controls at term-equivalent age, {{as well as to}} identify potential perinatal risk factors for white matter microstructural alterations in <b>moderate</b> <b>and</b> late preterm infants. Whole brain white matter microstructure was studied in 193 <b>moderate</b> <b>and</b> late preterm infants and 83 controls at term-equivalent age by performing Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data. <b>Moderate</b> <b>and</b> late preterm infants had lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean, axial and radial diffusivities compared with controls in nearly 70 % of the brain’s major white matter fiber tracts. In the <b>moderate</b> <b>and</b> late preterm group, being born small for gestational age and male sex were associated with lower fractional anisotropy, largely within the optic radiation, corpus callosum and corona radiata. In conclusion, <b>moderate</b> <b>and</b> late preterm infants exhibit widespread brain white matter microstructural alterations compared with controls at term-equivalent age, in patterns consistent with delayed or disrupted white matter microstructural development. These findings may underpin some of the neurodevelopmental delays observed in <b>moderate</b> <b>and</b> late preterm children...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe major {{purpose of}} this article is to expand the domain of the {{business}} research by providing conceptual analysis of the <b>moderating</b> <b>and</b> mediating variables and exploring their potent effects in business research. To provide specific implications, Kang et al. (2015) model with respect to Balanced Scorecard technique is conceptually extended. Theoretical foundation of the <b>moderating,</b> mediating, <b>and</b> their major distinctions along with appropriate statistical tests applicable to each situation are also provided. The model is also extended to analyzing interaction effects of Mediated-Moderation and Moderated-Mediation designs and their testing. The article concludes that: 1) the nature of complex business problems will be more transparently captured by considering <b>moderating</b> <b>and</b> mediating variables, 2) without specifying <b>moderating</b> <b>and</b> mediating variables, business models are incomplete and therefore are not able to solve real business obstacles. Lack of inclusion of <b>moderating</b> <b>and</b> mediating effects is one viable reason which indicates why most business models do not function in real practice, 3) <b>moderating</b> <b>and</b> mediating variables are widening the scope of the prevalent business theories, <b>and</b> 4) <b>moderating</b> <b>and</b> <b>moderating</b> variables makes it possible to respond to the inquiries regarding “when” “how” and “why” a particular relationship exists between the independent and dependent variables. Hence, this study posits great impacts in future correlational and experimental studies in business...|$|R

The popular referendum was held on September 11 and also produced mixed results. Some townships overwhelmingly supported submitting to U.S. law, but opposition to the government remained strong in areas where poor and landless people predominated. The final report of the commissioners recommended the use of the military to enforce the laws. The trend was towards submission, however, and westerners dispatched representatives William Findley and David Redick to meet with Washington and to halt the progress of the oncoming army. Washington and Hamilton declined, arguing that violence was likely to re-emerge if the army turned back.|$|E
5|$|The new {{government}} {{was faced with}} a major challenge: the Chamber of Deputies was divided into three groups: the ultraconservatives, the <b>Moderates</b> <b>and</b> the Liberals. Paranhos and Caxias named men who were either ultraconservatives or Moderates to the remaining portfolios, in an attempt to weaken the reinvigorated Liberal opposition and consolidate a workable governing majority. Despite successfully recruiting enough supporters from outside the party to form a government, the Cabinet was hobbled from the outset by its lack of internal unity. It was doomed when Paranhos's friend and former colleague in the Conciliation Cabinet, José Tomás Nabuco de Araújo, delivered a speech advocating a merger of Moderate Conservatives and Liberals into a truly new political party.|$|E
5|$|At the 5th National Congress, the Lê Duẩn/Lê Đức Thọ clique amassed {{considerable}} {{power by}} staffing the 5th Central Committee, the 5th Secretariat and the 5th Politburo {{with their own}} supporters. Several <b>moderates</b> <b>and</b> old companions of Hồ Chí Minh, as well as pro-Chinese communists (labelled dismissively as Maoists) and followers of Trường Chinh, {{were removed from the}} Politburo and the Central Committee. The most prominent ouster was that of Võ Nguyên Giáp, the commander at the Battle of Diên Biên Phu. Giáp's removal signaled more the defeat of a rival than of an ideological tendency. Nguyễn Duy Trinh and Lê Thanh Nghị were removed from the Politburo because of their moderate stances, while Trần Quốc Hoàn, Lê Văn Lương and Nguyễn Văn Linh were removed because of their alignment with Trường Chinh. In their place Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ appointed military men, including Đỗ Mười, Lê Đức Anh and General Đồng Sĩ Nguyên. The appointment of Nguyễn Đức Tâm and Nguyễn Cơ Thach strengthened Lê Đức Thọ. The Lê Duẩn/Lê Đức Thọ clique thereafter had a clear majority within the 5th Secretariat.|$|E
