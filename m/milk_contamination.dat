First, the cow’s udder must be cleaned and {{disinfected}} to prevent both <b>milk</b> <b>contamination</b> and udder infections.

Milk from a cow with mastitis cannot enter the human milk supply, thus farmers must be careful that infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the mastitis inspection, the milking technician will attach the milking cluster. The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off. The milk travels immediately through a cooling system and then into a large cooled storage tank, where it will stay until {{picked up by a}} refrigerated milk truck.

In contrast, when researching food consumption in China, several {{researchers have found that}} Chinese consumers' purchasing behavior contradicts with the demand theory: the higher priced items often result in greater quantity demanded, due to heightened food safety concerns (Herrmann et al. [2006]; Wang [2003]; Xu et al. [2010]). For example, Xu et al. [2010] showed that Chinese college students prefer higher priced milk because they believe the milk is safer than lower priced options.

Mycotoxins in food (aflatoxin B 1, B 2, G 1, G 2, zearalenone and ochratoxin) were detected by the method of thin layer chromatography – TLC and for the determination of aflatoxin M 1 was used an immunoassay kit competitive ELISA Ridascreen®. The residues of organophosphates and carbamates were performed by colorimetric method qualitatively.
