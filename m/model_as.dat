5|$|A warm {{seclusion}} is {{the mature}} {{phase of the}} extratropical cyclone lifecycle. This was conceptualized after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone <b>Model,</b> <b>as</b> developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones {{at the tail end}} of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the modeling {{problem of the}} linear accelerator RF system in SNS. Klystrons are <b>modeled</b> <b>as</b> linear parameter varying systems. The effect of the {{high voltage power supply}} ripple on the klystron output voltage and the output phase is <b>modeled</b> <b>as</b> an additive disturbance. The cavity is <b>modeled</b> <b>as</b> a linear system and the beam current is <b>modeled</b> <b>as</b> the exogenous disturbance. The output uncertainty of the low level RF system which results from the uncertainties in the RF components and cabling is <b>modeled</b> <b>as</b> multiplicative uncertainty. Also, the feedback loop uncertainty and digital signal processing signal conditioning subsystem uncertainties are lumped together and are <b>modeled</b> <b>as</b> multiplicative uncertainty. Finally, the time delays in the loop are <b>modeled</b> <b>as</b> a lumped time delay. For the perturbed open loop system, the closed loop system performance, and stability are analyzed with the PI feedback controller...|$|R

5|$|An {{alternate}} ending {{was present}} in the behind-the-scenes video, showing an exhausted Madonna leaving the party with a male <b>model,</b> <b>as</b> well as aftermath scenes of the party which were released in the first teaser trailer. The parting shot showed Madonna running {{around the room and}} posing in front of the windows overlooking New York. Other scenes included Madonna chatting with Ora and Rock in-between takes, sitting in the hallways, plunging towards the neon sock puppets multiple times as well as singing the song with the little girls {{from the beginning of the}} video. Another video set to Kleinenberg's remix featured further footage of Madonna dancing and more casual scenes featuring the guest stars.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero Smash Hits (titled Guitar Hero: Greatest Hits in Europe and Australia) was {{released}} in June 2009. It features full-band versions of 48 songs from earlier Guitar Hero games that only used the guitar controller. Unlike the previous versions, each of the songs {{is based on a}} master recording that includes some live tracks. The game follows a similar <b>model</b> <b>as</b> Guitar Hero: Metallica, and was developed by Neversoft and Beenox Studios for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, and Wii.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{introduced}} {{as a single}} sedan body style, the range expanded in 1979 to include a station wagon. From 1984, Holden began branding the flagship Commodore <b>model</b> <b>as</b> Holden Calais, with the Commodore Berlina introduced in 1984 gaining independent Holden Berlina nomenclature in 1988. Long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice derivatives and Commodore utility body variants followed in 1990. The third generation architecture spawned the most body styles, with a new Holden utility launched in 2000 (now officially as the Holden Ute), reborn Monaro coupé in 2001, four-door Holden Crewman utility and all-wheel drive (AWD) Holden Adventra crossover in 2003. Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) in 1987 began official modification of high performance variants of the Commodore and its derivatives, under its own nameplate.|$|E

5|$|Kohlberg's six stages {{can be more}} {{generally}} grouped into three levels of two stages each: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional. Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a stage <b>model,</b> <b>as</b> described in his theory of cognitive development, it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities. Stages cannot be skipped; each provides a new and necessary perspective, more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them.|$|E

She also then attended National Art Training School, or NATS, which {{marks the first}} time a member of the British royal family attended a public education institution. Like many women artists in the nineteenth century, Louise had to make do with training intended for industrial designers and art teachers rather than fine artists. There was no training from the nude <b>model,</b> <b>as</b> there was for male art students.|$|E

5|$|Rosetta@home is a {{distributed}} computing project aimed at protein structure prediction {{and is one}} of the most accurate tertiary structure predictors. The conformational states from Rosetta's software can be used to initialize a Markov state <b>model</b> <b>as</b> starting points for Folding@home simulations. Conversely, structure prediction algorithms can be improved from thermodynamic and kinetic models and the sampling aspects of protein folding simulations. As Rosetta only tries to predict the final folded state, and not how folding proceeds, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.|$|E

5|$|The {{announcement}} that Portal 2 {{would be available}} on PlayStation 3 {{came as a surprise}} to the industry because Gabe Newell had criticized that console in the past, citing difficulties in the port of The Orange Box. The move toward the PlayStation 3 was a result of growing frustration with Microsoft's policies for Xbox 360 content, including the difficulty of pushing patching and new content to players. Newell saw Sony's publication <b>model</b> <b>as</b> more open, allowing Steam-like features to be used on the console. Portal 2 was the first PlayStation 3 game to support a subset of features from Steamworks, including automatic updates, downloadable content, and community support. The game supports cross-platform play between the PlayStation 3, Windows, and OS X versions.|$|E
5|$|The steppe {{societies}} of Inner Asia, whose climate favoured a pastoral economy, stood {{in stark contrast}} to the Chinese mode of development. As animal herds are migratory by nature, communities could not afford to be stationary and therefore evolved as nomads. According to the influential Mongolist Owen Lattimore this lifestyle proved to be incompatible with the Chinese economic <b>model.</b> <b>As</b> the steppe population grew, pastoral agriculture alone could not support the population, and tribal alliances needed to be maintained by material rewards. For these needs, the nomads had to turn to the settled societies to get grains, metal tools, and luxury goods, which they could not produce by themselves. If denied trade by the settled peoples, the nomads would resort to raiding or even conquest.|$|E

The weak interaction does not produce bound states (nor does it involve binding energy) – something that gravity does on an astronomical scale, that the electromagnetic force does at the atomic level, and that the strong nuclear force does inside nuclei.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} the MISS account of <b>models</b> – <b>as</b> {{isolations}} and surrogate systems – accommodates and elaborates Sugden’s account of <b>models</b> <b>as</b> credible worlds and Hausman’s account of <b>models</b> <b>as</b> explorations. Theoretical <b>models</b> typically isolate by means of idealization, and they are representatives of some target system, which prompts issues of resemblance between the two to arise. <b>Models</b> <b>as</b> representations are constrained both ontologically (by their targets) and pragmatically (by the purposes and audiences of the modeller), and these relations are coordinated by a model commentary. Surrogate models are often about single mechanisms. They are distinguishable from substitute models, which are examined without any concern about their connections with the target. <b>Models</b> <b>as</b> credible worlds are surrogate models that are believed {{to provide access to}} their targets on account of their credibility (of which a few senses are distinguished) ...|$|R

It is far better to simply view the <b>models</b> <b>as</b> a one-parameter generalisation of Calogero-Moser models.

40|$|We {{review and}} {{critique}} {{a range of}} perspectives on the scientific role of individual-based evolutionary simulation <b>models</b> <b>as</b> they are used within artificial life. We find that such models {{have the potential to}} enrich existing modelling enterprises through their strength in modelling systems of interacting entities. Furthermore, simulation techniques promise to provide theoreticians in various fields with entirely new conceptual, as well as methodological, approaches. However, the precise manner in which simulations can be used <b>as</b> <b>models</b> is not clear. We present two apparently opposed perspectives on this issue: simulation <b>models</b> <b>as</b> "emergent computational thought experiments" and simulation <b>models</b> <b>as</b> realistic simulacra.
