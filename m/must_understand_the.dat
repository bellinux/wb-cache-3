5|$|A {{narrative}} rational for {{the concept}} of Hell {{can be found in}} the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. This narrative ends with Yudhishthira's visit to hell after being offered acceptance into heaven. This journey creates a scene for the audience that helps illustrate the importance of understanding hell as well as heaven before accepting either extreme. This idea provides an essential lesson regarding Dharma, a primary theme within the Mahabharata. Dharma is not a black and white concept, and all people are not entirely good or entirely evil. As such, tolerance is essential in order to truly understand the “right way of living”. We all <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> worst to truly understand and appreciate the best just as we must experience the best before we can experience the worst. This narrative utilizes the Hindu religion in order to teach lessons on tolerance and acceptance of one another's faults as well as virtues.|$|E
25|$|The auditor <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> recipient’s {{internal}} control system {{to determine if}} the recipient has proper safeguards that help manage federal assistance responsibly. After obtaining sufficient knowledge of that system, the auditor must perform audit procedures to verify the recipient’s {{internal control}} system works properly, and the recipient’s federal program operations comply with laws and regulations (e.g., the compliance audit portion of the Single Audit).|$|E
25|$|Dhamma {{was not a}} {{particular}} religious faith or practice, or an arbitrary formulated royal policy. Dharma related to generalized norms of social behavior and activities; Ashoka tried to synthesize various social norms which were current in his time. It cannot be understood by assuming {{it is one of}} the various religions that existed at that time. To understand why and how Ashoka formulated Dharma and its meaning, one <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> characteristics of the time in which he lived and to refer to Buddhist, Brahmanical and other texts where norms of social behavior are explained.|$|E

Consumption data for a population of interest can be generated through various types of consumption surveys or it may be available in databases maintained by various government agencies and world organizations. These consumption surveys and databases are discussed in the following sections.|$|E
25|$|While in college, Hogshead was {{an intern}} at the Women's Sports Foundation. The {{organization}} {{had a strong}} influence on her career direction and she {{has worked with the}} group for thirty years. She served on the board of trustees from 1987 to 1993 and as its President from 1993 to 1994. She is currently the Senior Director of Advocacy for the Women's Sports Foundation. Hogshead realized that a person <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> law in order to be an effective advocate for equity in collegiate sports using Title IX. She applied to and was accepted at Georgetown Law. In 1991 Hogshead was an underwear model in a well-publicized Jockey for Her advertisement.|$|E
25|$|The other {{class of}} {{possible}} mechanisms that are hypothesized {{to lead to}} copy number variations is non-homologous based. To distinguish between this and homologous based mechanisms, one <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> concept of homology. Homologous pairing of chromosomes involved using DNA strands that are highly similar to each other (~97%) and these strands must be longer than a certain length to avoid short but highly similar pairings. Non-homologous pairings, on the other hand, rely on only few base pairs of similarity between two strands, therefore {{it is possible for}} genetic materials to be exchanged or duplicated in the process of non-homologous based double stranded repairs.|$|E

25|$|The auditor is {{responsible}} for conducting the actual audit of the recipient in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and using the guidance provided by the OMB Circular A-133 and its Compliance Supplement, all of which establish certain rules to follow during the Single Audit. The auditor must establish audit objectives that determine whether the recipient complied with laws and regulations. They must research the recipient’s federal assistance awards and programs to determine applicability of specific laws and regulations. They <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> recipient, its organization, operations, internal control systems, and ability to responsibly manage federal assistance. They must perform audit procedures (some of which are suggested by the Compliance Supplement) to meet these audit objectives.|$|E
25|$|Taste {{opens with}} Lady Pentweazel who {{believes}} that the works of art, the Venus de' Medici and the Mary de Medici, are sisters in the Medici family. Two other collectors, Novice and Lord Dupe, claim {{to be able to}} determine the age and value of coins and medals by tasting them while Puff, an auctioneer, convinces them and Sir Positive Bubble that broken china and statuary are worth far more than perfect pieces. Lord Dupe follows this advice by purchasing a canvas with the paint scraped off. The foibles of ignorant art collectors and predatory dealers were presented by Foote in this high burlesque comedy. In order for an audience to appreciate high burlesque, they <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> standards of true taste before they can recognize the conflict between those standards and the characters. The audience that saw the premier of Taste evidently did not understand this conflict as the play was not successful and only played five performances.|$|E
25|$|Schizophrenic patients' {{deficit in}} theory of mind impairs their daily {{interactions}} with others. An {{example of a}} disrupted interaction is one between a schizophrenic parent and a child. Theory of mind is particularly important for parents, who <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> thoughts and behaviors {{of their children and}} react accordingly. Dysfunctional parenting is associated with deficits in the first-order theory of mind, the ability to understand another person's thoughts, and the second-order theory of mind, the ability to infer what one person thinks about another person's thoughts. Compared with healthy mothers, mothers with schizophrenia are found to be more remote, quiet, self-absorbed, insensitive, unresponsive, and to have fewer satisfying interactions with their children. They also tend to misinterpret their children's emotional cues, and often misunderstand neutral faces as negative. Activities such as role-playing and individual or group-based sessions are effective interventions that help the parents improve on perspective-taking and theory of mind. Although there is a strong association between theory of mind deficit and parental role dysfunction, future studies could strengthen the relationship by possibly establishing a causal role of theory of mind on parenting abilities.|$|E
