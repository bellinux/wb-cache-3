5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements <b>may</b> <b>still</b> be admissible.|$|E
5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they <b>may</b> <b>still</b> be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E

5|$|A modern {{repeat of}} the 1858 storm is {{estimated}} to cause damages of {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars. A {{repeat of the}} 1939 tropical storm would cause around 200million dollars in damage. The most serious damage would be due to rains rather than winds or storm surge, although distant hurricanes <b>may</b> <b>still</b> create heavy surf, possibly injuring or killing people. Nora caused millions in damage and skirted extreme southeastern California.|$|E
5|$|A {{much smaller}} {{version of the}} Cathedral, also {{designed}} by Sir Frederick Gibberd, was constructed in 1965 as a chapel for the former De La Salle College of Education, Middleton, Lancashire, a Catholic teacher-training college.

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. American alligator bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite <b>may</b> <b>still</b> result in a fatal infection.|$|E
5|$|Bakerian mimicry, {{named after}} Herbert G. Baker, {{is a form}} of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, {{cheating}} pollinators out of a reward. This reproductive mimicry may not be readily apparent as members of the same species <b>may</b> <b>still</b> exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. It is common in many species of Caricaceae.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{was long}} {{considered}} the element {{with the highest}} atomic mass that is stable. However, in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a half-life {{more than a billion}} times the estimated age of the universe. Because of its tremendously long half-life, bismuth <b>may</b> <b>still</b> be considered stable for almost all purposes.|$|E

5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and <b>may</b> <b>still</b> be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|European {{settlers}} on the North American Prairies {{found that}} the sod least likely to deteriorate due to freezing or rain came from dried sloughs.

5|$|Even {{though it}} was {{subordinate}} to Vale Royal Abbey, the church at Llanbadarn Fawr remained important in its own right.
