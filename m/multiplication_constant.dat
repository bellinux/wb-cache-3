The elapsed time and the chance for human error between initial input and final output are greatly reduced in Program George. A matched set of reflector savings for a reflected, cylindrical core, which was formerly obtained by hand, is now computed by the program.

The diffusion coefficient contains a transport correction as well as a Behrens correction for heterogeneous structure. Flux-depression factors at thermal and two epithermal levels are computed in annular, cylindrical geometry by one-energy, P/sub 3 / transport theory approximation in the I/sub 2 / pontion of the program, or they may be given as input.

40|$|Abstract—The <b>multiplication</b> of <b>constants</b> by a {{data input}} is an {{essential}} operation in digital signal processing (DSP) systems. For applications requiring {{a large number of}} <b>constant</b> <b>multiplications</b> under stringent hardware constraints, it is generally realized under a folded architecture, where a single constant selected from a set of multiple constants is multiplied by the data input at each time, called time-multiplexed <b>constant</b> <b>multiplication</b> (TMCM). This paper addresses the problem of optimizing the complexity of a TMCM design and introduces an algorithm that finds the least complex TMCM design by sharing the logic operators, i. e., adders, subtractors, adders/subtractors, and multiplexors (MUXes).

A standard technique to reduce these requirements {{is to use}} combinations of shifts and additions to execute multiplications. The approach is particularly effective when multiple <b>constant</b> <b>multiplications</b> are necessary. We introduce a simple, yet effective multiple <b>constant</b> <b>multiplication</b> (MCM) algorithm based on the iterative probabilistic greedy principle. Reusability and time to market constraints and therefore rapid implementations of integrated circuits placed design intellectual property at risk for piracy.

Specifically, we introduce eight hard and soft watermarking techniques applied during the pre-processing phase of the MCM process.
