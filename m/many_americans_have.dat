500|$|Economics Nobel laureate Paul Krugman {{said that}} the scandal came about because conservatives {{did not like the}} fact that the VHA system, which is [...] "an island of socialized medicine," [...] is working well, so they seized on wait times as “a gift from God” to {{discredit}} the VHA.... "It’s still true that Veterans Affairs provides excellent care, at low cost," ... "Those waiting lists arise partly because so many veterans want care, but Congress has provided neither clear guidelines on who is entitled to coverage, nor sufficient resources to cover all applicants. And, yes, some officials appear to have responded to incentives to reduce waiting times by falsifying data."..."Yet, on average, veterans don’t appear to wait longer for care than other Americans," ...

[...] However, [...] "Canadians spend about 55% of what Americans spend on health care and have longer life expectancy and lower infant mortality rates. <b>Many</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> access to quality healthcare.

6000|$|In {{order to}} {{appreciate}} the influence of such a class of men, {{it is necessary to}} recollect their numbers, wealth, and union, it has often been a source of mortification to me to see the columns of the leading journals of the largest town of the republic, teeming with reports of the celebrations of English, Irish, German, French, and Scotch societies; and in which the sentiments promulgated, half of the time, are foreign rather than American. Charitable associations, as charities, may be well enough, but the institutions of the country, so generous and liberal in themselves, are outraged by every factitious attempt to overshadow them by these appeals to the prejudices and recollections of another state of society. At least, we might be spared the parade in the journals, and the offensive appearance of monopolizing the land, which these accounts assume. Intelligent travellers observe and comment on these things, and one of them quaintly asked me, not long since, [...] "if really there were no Americans in America?" [...] Can it be matter of surprise that when the stranger sees these men so prominent in print and in society, (in many instances quite deservedly), he should mistake their influence, and attach an importance to their opinions which they do not deserve? That Europe has been receiving false notions of America from some source, during the present century, is proved by the results so completely discrediting her open predictions; and, while I know that <b>many</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> innocently aided in the deception, I have little doubt that the foreign merchants established in the country {{have been one of the}} principal causes of the errors.|$|E
6000|$|Later we laid our bones down to {{crossing}} the Rockies. An American train can {{climb up the}} side of a house if need be, but it is not pleasant to sit in it. We clomb till we struck violent cold and an Indian reservation, and the noble savage came to look at us. He was a Flathead and unlovely. Most Americans are charmingly frank about the Indian. [...] "Let us get rid of him as soon as possible," [...] they say. [...] "We have no use for him." [...] Some of the men I meet have a notion that we in India are exterminating the native in the same fashion, and I have been asked to fix a date for the final extinguishment of the Aryan. I answer {{that it will be a}} long business. Very <b>many</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> an offensive habit of referring to natives as [...] "heathen." [...] Mahometans and Hindus are heathen alike in their eyes, and they vary the epithet with [...] "pagan" [...] and [...] "idolater." [...] But this is beside the matter, which is the Stampede Tunnel--our actual point of {{crossing the}} Rockies. Thank Heaven, I need never take that tunnel again! It is about two miles long, and in effect is nothing more than the gallery of a mine shored with timber and lighted with electric lamps. Black darkness would be preferable, for the lamps just reveal the rough cutting of the rocks, and that is very rough indeed. The train crawls through, brakes down, and you can hear the water and little bits of stone falling on the roof of the car. Then you pray, pray fervently, and the air gets stiller and stiller, and you dare not take your unwilling eyes off the timber shoring, lest a prop should fall, for lack of your moral support. Before the tunnel was built you crossed in the open air by a switchback line. A watchman goes through the tunnel after each train, but that is no protection. He just guesses that another train will pull through, and the engine-driver guesses the same thing. Some day between the two of them there will be a cave in the tunnel. Then the enterprising reporter will talk about the shrieks and groans of the buried and the heroic efforts of the Press in securing first information, and--that will be all. Human life is of small account out here.|$|E

50|$|Working-class Americans {{and many}} of those in the middle class may also face {{occupation}} alienation.

50|$|There {{were also}} Darwinian-inspired excuses for the {{discrimination}} of the Irish in America. <b>Many</b> <b>Americans</b> believed {{that since the}} Irish were Celts and not Anglo-Saxons, they were racially inferior and deserved second-hand citizenship. The Irish being of inferior intelligence was a belief held by <b>many</b> <b>Americans.</b> This notion was held {{due to the fact}} that the Irish topped the charts demographically in terms of arrests and imprisonment. They also had more people confined to insane asylums and poorhouses than any other group. The racial supremacy belief that <b>many</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> at the time contributed significantly to Irish discrimination.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{financial}} crisis of late 2008, <b>many</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> struggled with the negative change to their credit score. Reduced credit lines resulting in {{a new group of}} consumers in need of liquidity forced this growing consumer segment to seek alternative financial services providers. Businesses relying on traditional credit reports to make credit decisions have had limited to no visibility on the new credit usage behaviors of this growing portion because alternative data is not information that the traditional bureaus capture or tend to report.|$|E

Many prominent Americans, such as the noted painter Charles Wilson Peale and the famous military leader George Armstrong Custer, were enthusiastic taxidermists. The art has enjoyed a pervasive integration {{into the fabric of}} American social life as practitioners are found in practically every small town in America. Specimens are widely employed in home and store decorations, for business advertising, for sporting trophies, and perhaps, most importantly, reifying the notion that humans can symbolically “restore” life to dead animals — thereby, in a sense, demonstrating our perceived human power over death.|$|E

[...] Governor Bill Haslam of Tennessee said: [...] "I don't think that's a valid option for Tennessee...I don't think we’ll be seceding.” The press secretary to Governor Rick Perry released a statement saying Perry [...] "believes in the greatness of our Union and nothing {{should be done to}} change it" [...] but [...] "also shares the frustrations <b>many</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> with our federal government." ...|$|E
