50|$|Nitrovasodilators which aren't nitrates include <b>molsidomine</b> and its active {{metabolite}} linsidomine, {{as well as}} sodium nitroprusside. These substances do {{not need}} to be reduced to donate NO.|$|E
50|$|Nitrovasodilators are prodrugs that donate NO {{by various}} mechanisms. Nitrates undergo {{chemical}} reduction, likely mediated by enzymes. <b>Molsidomine</b> and nitroprusside already contain nitrogen {{in the right}} oxidation state (+2) and liberate NO {{without the aid of}} enzymes.|$|E
50|$|No {{interaction}} {{studies have}} been conducted. Because of its mechanism, tetrahydrobiopterin might interact with dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors like methotrexate and trimethoprim, and NO-enhancing drugs like nitroglycerin, <b>molsidomine,</b> minoxidil, and PDE5 inhibitors. Combination of tetrahydrobiopterin with levodopa can lead to increased excitability.|$|E
50|$|The nitrates {{are used}} for the {{treatment}} and prevention of angina and acute myocardial infarction, while <b>molsidomine</b> acts too slowly to be useful {{for the treatment of}} acute angina. For quick action in the treatment of angina, glyceryl trinitrate is used in form of a sublingual spray (nitro spray) or as soft capsules to be crunched.|$|E
50|$|Nitrates mainly {{differ in}} speed and {{duration}} of their action. Glyceryl trinitrate acts fast and short (10 to 30 minutes), while most other nitrates have a slower onset of action, but are effective {{for up to six}} hours. <b>Molsidomine,</b> as has been mentioned, not only acts slowly but also differs from the nitrates in exhibiting no tolerance. Nitroprusside, given intravenously, acts immediately, and after stopping the infusion blood pressure returns to its previous level within ten minutes.|$|E
50|$|Linsidomine (3-morpholinosydnonimine or SIN-1) is a vasodilator. It is a {{metabolite}} of the antianginal drug <b>molsidomine</b> {{and acts}} by releasing NO from the endothelial cells nonenzymatically. It also hyperpolarizes the cell membrane through influencing the sodium-potassium pump and thereby rendering it less responsive to adrenergic stimulation. Linsidomine injection at {{a dose of}} 1 mg produces usable erection in about 70% of patients and full erection in up to 50% of patients. Linsidomine {{does not appear to}} be associated with priapism.|$|E
50|$|Nitrates exhibit {{development}} of tolerance, or more specifically tachyphylaxis, meaning that repeated application {{results in a}} fast decrease of effect, usually within 24 hours. A pause of six to eight hours restores the original effectiveness. This phenomenon was originally {{thought to be a}} consequence of depletion of thiol (-SH) groups necessary for the reduction of nitrates. While this theory would fit the fact that <b>molsidomine</b> (which is not reduced) does not exhibit tachyphylaxis, it has meanwhile been refuted. Newer theories include increase of oxidative stress resulting in deactivation of NO to peroxynitrite, and liberation of the vasoconstrictors angiotensin II and endothelin as the blood vessels' reaction to NO-mediated vasodilation.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. A new once-a-day (o. a. d.) {{formulation}} of <b>molsidomine</b> (16 mg) was evaluated {{in patients with}} stable angina pectoris. The aims were to characterize its pharmacokinetics after a single dose, to demonstrate its clinical efficacy and safety versus placebo and to investigate correlations between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Methods. Forty-two patients were recruited in a double-blind, crossover, randomized placebo-controlled trial. The pharmacokinetics of <b>molsidomine</b> and SIN- 1, its active metabolite, were determined at specific time points (3, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 and 24 h) after the administration of a single dose of <b>molsidomine</b> 16 mg o. a. d. in all patients distributed into seven groups. Twenty-eight of these 42 patients showed a positive baseline cycloergometric exercise test response during the run-in placebo period and were {{used to compare the}} efficacy of <b>molsidomine</b> to placebo. Relationships between plasma concentration in <b>molsidomine</b> or SIN- 1 and ischemic threshold were assessed in 16 of the 28 patients with a positive exercise test at baseline. Indeed, the censored variable ischemia-limited tolerance to exercise could not be evaluated in those patients who did not show exercise-induced ischemia anymore under <b>molsidomine</b> 16 mg o. a. d. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships were evaluated using regression models and correlation coefficients. Results. The highest average concentration in <b>molsidomine</b> and SIN- 1 occurred after 6 h, then a plateau of 15 - 20 ng/ml <b>molsidomine</b> and 0. 8 - 3. 0 ng/ml SIN- 1 was maintained for at least 8 h and the mean residual <b>molsidomine</b> concentration 24 h post-drug intake was around 8 ng/ml, still in the effective range of 5 - 10 ng/ml. A significant increase in total workload (+ 52 W min, P= 0. 009), total exercise time (+ 32 s, P= 0. 003) and time to angina (+ 25 s, P= 0. 016) was measured with <b>molsidomine</b> 16 mg o. a. d. relative to placebo. Using linear regression, significant correlation coefficients were determined between <b>molsidomine</b> plasma concentrations (but not SIN- 1) and exercise test improvements (r= 0. 827, P< 0. 001 for the total workload; r= 0. 772, P< 0. 001 for the total exercise time; and r= 0. 566, P= 0. 028 for the time to 1 mm ST-segment depression). Conclusion. The pharmacokinetics of <b>molsidomine</b> 16 mg in patients with stable angina pectoris is compatible with a o. a. d. dosage regimen. This o. a. d. formulation is effective and well-tolerated, providing a 24 -h therapeutic control of myocardial ischemia.

40|$|There is a sex {{difference}} in the blood pressure (BP) responses to prooxidants and antioxidants in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). In contrast to males, BP in female SHR does not decrease in response to antioxidants, such as tempol or apocynin, or increase {{in response to the}} prooxidant, <b>molsidomine.</b> <b>Molsidomine</b> decreases BP and increases expression of antioxidants in male Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), but not male SHR. The present study tested the hypothesis that the mechanism responsible for the lack of a pressor response to <b>molsidomine</b> in females is due to higher endogenous nitric oxide (NO) or to compensatory upregulation of renal antioxidant enzymes. Female SHR were treated with <b>molsidomine</b> in {{the presence or absence of}} nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) for 2 wk. <b>Molsidomine</b> increased nitrate/nitrite (NOx) and F 2 -isoprostane (F 2 -IsoP) excretion, whereas l-NAME reduced NOx but increased F-Isop. <b>Molsidomine</b> and l-NAME together further reduced NOx and increased F 2 -IsoP. <b>Molsidomine</b> alone had no effect on BP; l-NAME alone increased BP. The combination of <b>molsidomine</b> and l-NAME did not increase BP above l-NAME alone levels. Whole body and renal oxidative stress increased, while renal cortical Cu,Zn-SOD expression was downregulated and catalase was upregulated by molsidomine; glutathione peroxidase expression was unaffected. These data support our previous studies suggesting that BP in female SHR is independent of either increases or decreases in oxidative stress. The mechanisms responsible for the sex {{difference in}} BP response to increase or decrease of oxidative stress are not due to increased NO in females or to compensatory upregulation of antioxidant enzymes in response to increases in oxidants...|$|E

40|$|A double-blind, placebo-controlled, {{crossover}} study {{was performed in}} 50 patients with ischemic heart disease and stable angina to determine the duration of efficacy of 8 mg <b>molsidomine</b> in extended-release form.

40|$|Enhancing {{perinatal}} {{nitric oxide}} (NO) availability persistently reduces {{blood pressure in}} spontaneously hypertensive rats. We hypothesize that this approach can be generalized to other models of genetic hypertension, for instance those associated with renal injury. Perinatal exposure to the NO donor <b>molsidomine</b> was studied in fawn-hooded hypertensive (FHH) rats, a model of mild hypertension, impaired preglomerular resistance, and progressive renal injury. Perinatal <b>molsidomine</b> increased urinary NO metabolite excretion at 8 wk of age, i. e., 4 wk after treatment was stopped (P < 0. 05). Systolic blood pressure was persistently reduced after <b>molsidomine</b> (42 -wk females: 118 +/- 3 vs. 141 +/- 5 and 36 -wk males: 139 +/- 4 vs. 158 +/- 4 mmHg; both P < 0. 001). Perinatal treatment decreased glomerular filtration rate (P < 0. 05) and renal blood flow (P < 0. 01) and increased renal vascular resistance (P < 0. 05), without affecting filtration fraction, suggesting persistently increased preglomerular resistance. At 4 wk of age natriuresis was transiently increased by <b>molsidomine</b> (P < 0. 05). <b>Molsidomine</b> decreased glomerulosclerosis (P < 0. 05). Renal blood flow correlated positively with glomerulosclerosis in control (P < 0. 001) but not in perinatally treated FHH rats.

The results demonstrated that 1) in vitro application of sodium nitroprusside to perfused adipocytes or <b>molsidomine</b> to sliced adipose tissues affects isoprenaline-induced lipolysis in two ways, an increase in lipolysis at low isoprenaline concentrations (which means the sensitization of adipose tissues to adrenergic effect by NO) and decreased adrenergic agonist-stimulated lipolysis at higher concentration of isoprenaline (a decrease in the maximum lipolytic effect of isoprenaline), 2) low concentrations of <b>molsidomine</b> alone induced lipolysis from adipose tissue which attained more than 60 % of that by isoprenaline (pD 2 value for <b>molsidomine</b> = 11. 2, while pD 2 for isoprenaline = 8. 17) while sodium nitroprusside did not affect the basal lipolysis significantly, 3) in vivo administration of <b>molsidomine</b> for 2 days reduced the maximum lipolytic effect of isoprenaline and (only non-significantly) increased the sensitivity to low doses of isoprenaline.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether a membrane-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic, tempol, added either alone or in combination with the nitric oxide (NO) donor <b>molsidomine,</b> prevents the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in chronic hypoxic rats. Chronic hypobaric hypoxia (10 % oxygen) for 2 weeks increased the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), right ventricle and lung wet weight. Relaxations evoked by acetylcholine (ACh) and the <b>molsidomine</b> metabolite SIN- 1 were impaired in isolated proximal, but not distal pulmonary arteries, from chronic hypoxic rats. Treatment with tempol (86 mg kg− 1 day− 1 in drinking water) normalized RVSP and reduced right ventricular hypertrophy, while systemic blood pressure, lung and liver weights, and blunted ACh relaxation of pulmonary arteries were unchanged. Treatment with <b>molsidomine</b> (15 mg kg− 1 day− 1 in drinking water) had the same effects as tempol, except that liver weight was reduced, and potassium and U 46619 -evoked vasoconstrictions in pulmonary arteries were increased.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the mechanisms involved in nitrate tolerance, we randomized 23 patients with {{congestive heart failure}} resulting from coronary artery disease to an isosorbide dinitrate or a <b>molsidomine</b> infusion.

These results were obtained in the presence of mean plasma levels of <b>molsidomine</b> ranging from 20 to 28 ng ml- 1. The time-action curve of the antifibrillatory effect of <b>molsidomine</b> parallels those at the level of post-ischaemic electrocardiographic changes...|$|E
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is {{considered}} as an intracellular messenger in the brain. Its involvement in learning and memory processes has been proposed. Compounds that inhibit NO synthase (NOS), the key synthesizing enzyme, may inhibit cognition, while NO donors may facilitate it. The {{present study was}} designed to investigate the effects of the NO donor <b>molsidomine</b> on rats' spatial memory. Thus, the ability of <b>molsidomine</b> (2 and 4 mg/kg, i. p.) in attenuating spatial memory deficits produced either by the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (0. 2 mg/kg, s. c.) or by the NOS inhibitor L-NAME (30 mg/kg, i. p.) was assessed. For this aim, the object location test was selected. In the first study, <b>molsidomine</b> (4 mg/kg) counteracted the scopolamine-induced performance deficits in this spatial memory task. Subsequently, pre-training administration of <b>molsidomine</b> (4 mg/kg but not 2 mg/kg) antagonized also the impairing effects produced by L-NAME in the object location paradigm. These results indicate that NO is involved in spatial recognition memory and that an NO component modulates the effects of the cholinergic system on spatial memory. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) of the {{intestine}} causes mucosal injury {{associated with}} a high death rate in rats. AIM: To investigate whether nitric oxide (NO) might be implicated in {{the recovery of the}} intestinal mucosa after ischaemic insult. METHODS: Wistar rats were subjected to mesenteric artery occlusion for 90 minutes. The animals were given either L-arginine, the substrate of NO synthase, or <b>molsidomine,</b> a NO donor. The controls received casein hydrolysate. The compounds were administered by gavage 19, 16, and 1. 5 hours before ischaemia. Mucosal barrier permeability and cGMP content were determined 24 hours after ischaemia. RESULTS: Survival after I/R was 50 % in the control group. Animals treated with L-arginine or <b>molsidomine</b> exhibited a higher survival rate (70 % and 83 % respectively). Mucosal barrier permeability was decreased in rats receiving L-arginine or <b>molsidomine</b> compared with controls (4. 0 (0. 9) and 2. 6 (0. 6) v 11. 2 (1. 6) 14 C-PEG pmol/segment, p < 0. 05). Increased cGMP content was seen in the mucosa of the L-arginine group. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that pretreatment with L-arginine or <b>molsidomine</b> ameliorates survival after intestinal I/R and improves mucosal barrier function...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{different}} functional monomers {{were used}} with {{ethylene glycol dimethacrylate}} as a cross-linker and <b>molsidomine</b> as a template to obtain molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). Non-covalent interactions between <b>molsidomine</b> and each functional monomer in DMSO prior to thermal bulk polymerization were utilized. On the basis of calculated imprinting factors, MIP prepared with N,N’-diallyltartaramide was chosen for further investigations. Examination of interactions in the prepolymerization complex between <b>molsidomine</b> and N,N’-diallyltartaramide was performed using the Job method. The absorbance of isomolar solutions reaching a maximum for the molar ratio of template to monomer equal to 1 : 4. Scatchard analysis was used for estimation of the dissociation constants and the maximum amounts of binding sites. The polymer based on N,N’-diallyltartaramide has two classes of heterogeneous binding sites characterized by two values of Kd and two Bmax: Kd(1) = 1. 17 mM- 1 and Bmax(1) = 0. 8 μmol/mg for the higher affinity binding sites, and Kd(2) = 200 μM- 1 and Bmax(2) = 2. 05 μmol/mg for the lower affinity binding sites. Furthermore, effects of pH and organic solvent on binding properties of MIP and NIP were investigated, together with release of <b>molsidomine</b> from both MIP and NIP...|$|E
40|$|The aim {{of present}} {{project was to}} uncover the effect of {{pharmacological}} increase in acute and chronic nitric oxide (NO) production on cardioprotective effect of chronic hypoxia. We studied the effect of NO donor <b>molsidomine</b> on hemodynamic conditions and ischemia - induced myocardium injury. Male Wistar rats were exposed to continual hypoxia in a normobaric chamber (10 % O 2, 4 weeks). Rats received <b>molsidomine</b> either chronically (15 mg/kg/day) in drinking water or acutely (10 mg/kg) in saline infused 30 min before ischemia. Control rats were kept under normoxia and treated in a corresponding manner. Adaptation to chronic hypoxia resulted in development of pulmonary hypertension. Chronic treatment with <b>molsidomine</b> slightly reduced these consequences of chronic hypoxia but it {{had no effect on}} increased cardiac ischemic tolerance in chronically hypoxic rats. On the other hand acute treatment with <b>molsidomine</b> significantly reduced infarct size and increased the number of arrhythmias in both normoxic and chronically hypoxic animals. In conclusion, our data suggests that acute increase in availability of NO is cardioprotective in both normoxic and chronically hypoxic rats contrary to its chronic increase which seems to have no protective contribution...|$|E
