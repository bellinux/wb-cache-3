5|$|A 2015 study {{concluded}} that multiple system atrophy (MSA), a rare human neurodegenerative disease, {{is caused by a}} <b>misfolded</b> version of a protein called alpha-synuclein, and is therefore also classifiable as a prion disease.

5|$|In {{response}} to cellular stresses– such as infection, heat shock, or oxidative damage– heat shock proteins that identify <b>misfolded</b> or unfolded proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation are expressed. Both Hsp27 and Hsp90—chaperone proteins have {{been implicated in}} increasing {{the activity of the}} ubiquitin-proteasome system, though they are not direct participants in the process. Hsp70, on the other hand, binds exposed hydrophobic patches on the surface of <b>misfolded</b> proteins and recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases such as CHIP to tag the proteins for proteasomal degradation. The CHIP protein (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) is itself regulated via inhibition of interactions between the E3 enzyme CHIP and its E2 binding partner.|$|E
5|$|Dysregulation of the {{ubiquitin}} proteasome {{system may}} contribute to several neural diseases. It may lead to brain tumors such as astrocytomas. In some of the late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that share aggregation of <b>misfolded</b> proteins as a common feature, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, large insoluble aggregates of <b>misfolded</b> proteins can form and then result in neurotoxicity, through mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Decreased proteasome activity has been suggested {{as a cause of}} aggregation and Lewy body formation in Parkinson's. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that yeast models of Parkinson's are more susceptible to toxicity from α-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies, under conditions of low proteasome activity. Impaired proteasomal activity may underlie cognitive disorders such as the autism spectrum disorders, and muscle and nerve diseases such as inclusion body myopathy.|$|E

40|$|Our current {{structural}} and biologic {{understanding of the}} <b>misfolding</b> diseases has restricted the development of therapies that target these diseases at a molecular level. The prion diseases are illustrative of this group of <b>misfolding</b> disorders and provide a model system for therapeutic intervention. Strategies to inhibit the replication and accumulation of the prion protein are being developed and have entered animal and clinical studies. Due to the underlying molecular basis of this disease class, many of the therapeutic approaches used to target prion <b>misfolding</b> have parallels in other <b>misfolding</b> diseases.

40|$|Protein <b>misfolding</b> {{underlies}} neurodegenerative disorders, {{for which}} no treatment is available. In particular, we present an investigation of <b>misfolding</b> process of Ataxin- 3 (AT- 3) whose <b>misfolding</b> is responsible of a neurodegenerative disease, named Spinocerebral Ataxia Type 3. Atomic force Microscopy (AFM) has been exploited {{with the aim of}} addressing a protein direct imaging at nanoscale level. A first analysis of folding process for several AT- 3 variants was exploited to obtain kinetic folding model, depending on the length of the poly-Q chain. The <b>misfolding</b> process was then studied due to thermal treatments and to interaction with solid surface with different physical properties. In particular for the native domain (AT- 3 / 182 Δ), named Josephin domain (JD), both filaments of proteins and isolated globular structures on gold and silicon are detected, while only globular entities are observed on mica. Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MD) of isolated AT- 3 / 182 Δ were also performed considering the effect of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the surface. We show that different conformations promote (on gold) or inhibit (on mica) the protein <b>misfolding.</b> These results suggest that the expanded poly-Q tract increases the probability of <b>misfolding</b> but the native domain itself acts as template in the <b>misfolding</b> pathway, when in contact with hydrophobic substrates...|$|R
5|$|Several {{pathways}} {{by which}} mHTT may cause cell death have been identified. These include: effects on chaperone proteins, which help fold proteins and remove <b>misfolded</b> ones; interactions with caspases, which {{play a role}} in the process of removing cells; the toxic effects of glutamine on nerve cells; impairment of energy production within cells; and effects on the expression of genes.|$|E
5|$|Until 2015 {{all known}} {{mammalian}} prion diseases {{were considered to}} be caused by the prion protein, PrP; in 2015 Multiple System Atrophy was found to be likely caused by a new prion, the <b>misfolded</b> form of a protein called alpha-synuclein. The endogenous, properly folded form of the prion protein is denoted PrPC (for Common or Cellular), whereas the disease-linked, <b>misfolded</b> form is denoted PrPSc (for Scrapie), after one of the diseases first linked to prions and neurodegeneration.) The precise structure of the prion is not known, though they can be formed by combining PrPC, polyadenylic acid, and lipids in a protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) reaction. Proteins showing prion-type behavior are also found in some fungi, which has been useful in helping to understand mammalian prions. Fungal prions do not appear to cause disease in their hosts.|$|E
5|$|Once formed, {{proteins}} only {{exist for}} {{a certain period of}} time and are then degraded and recycled by the cell's machinery through the process of protein turnover. A protein's lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells. Abnormal or <b>misfolded</b> proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable.|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} {{deficiency of}} the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a plasma membrane chloride channel, {{leads to the}} development of cystic fibrosis. The deletion of a phenylalanine at residue 508 (F 508 del) is {{the most common cause of}} CFTR <b>misfolding</b> leading to the disease. The F 508 del <b>misfolding</b> originates in the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD 1), which induces a global conformational change in CFTR through NBD 1 ’s interactions with other domains. Such global <b>misfolding</b> produces a mutant chloride channel that is impaired in exocytic trafficking, peripheral stability, and channel gating. The nature and atomic details of F 508 del <b>misfolding</b> have been subject to extensive research during the past decade. Current data support a central role for NBD 1 in F 508 del <b>misfolding</b> and rescue. Many cis-acting NBD 1 second-site mutations rescue F 508 del <b>misfolding</b> in the context of full-length CFTR. While some of these mutations appear to specifically counteract the F 508 del-induced <b>misfolding,</b> others release certain inherent conformational constraints of the human wild-type CFTR. Several small-molecule correctors were recently found to act on key interdomain interfaces of F 508 del CFTR. Potential rational approaches have been proposed in an attempt to develop highly effective small molecule modulators that improve the cell surface functional expression of F 508 del CFTR...|$|R

5|$|Although most proteasomal {{substrates}} must be ubiquitinated {{before being}} degraded, {{there are some}} exceptions to this general rule, especially when the proteasome plays a normal role in the post-translational processing of the protein. The proteasomal activation of NF-κB by processing p105 into p50 via internal proteolysis is one major example. Some proteins that are hypothesized to be unstable due to intrinsically unstructured regions, are degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner. The most well-known example of a ubiquitin-independent proteasome substrate is the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. Ubiquitin-independent mechanisms targeting key cell cycle regulators such as p53 have also been reported, although p53 is also subject to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Finally, structurally abnormal, <b>misfolded,</b> or highly oxidized proteins are also subject to ubiquitin-independent and 19S-independent degradation under conditions of cellular stress.|$|E
5|$|Chronic wasting disease, {{transmitted}} by a <b>misfolded</b> protein {{known as a}} prion, affects the brain tissue in elk, and has been detected throughout their range in North America. First documented in the late 1960s in mule deer, the disease has affected elk on game farms and in the wild {{in a number of}} regions. Elk that have contracted the disease begin to show weight loss, increased watering needs, disorientation and listlessness, and at an advanced stage the disease leads to death. The disease is similar to but not the same as mad cow disease, and no risks to humans have been documented, nor has the disease been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated cattle. In 2002, South Korea banned the importation of elk antler velvet due to concerns about chronic wasting disease.|$|E
5|$|Proteasomes {{are part}} of a major {{mechanism}} by which cells regulate the concentration of particular proteins and degrade <b>misfolded</b> proteins. Proteins are tagged for degradation with a small protein called ubiquitin. The tagging reaction is catalyzed by enzymes called ubiquitin ligases. Once a protein is tagged with a single ubiquitin molecule, this is a signal to other ligases to attach additional ubiquitin molecules. The result is a polyubiquitin chain that is bound by the proteasome, allowing it to degrade the tagged protein. The degradation process yields peptides of about seven to eight amino acids long, which can then be further degraded into shorter amino acid sequences and used in synthesizing new proteins.|$|E
40|$|The β 2 –α 2 loop of PrPC {{is a key}} {{modulator}} of disease-associated {{prion protein}} <b>misfolding.</b> Amino acids that differentiate mouse (Ser 169, Asn 173) and deer (Asn 169, Thr 173) PrPC appear to confer dramatically different structural properties in this region {{and it has been}} suggested that amino acid sequences associated with structural rigidity of the loop also confer susceptibility to prion disease. Using mouse recombinant PrP, we show that mutating residue 173 from Asn to Thr alters protein stability and <b>misfolding</b> only subtly, whilst changing Ser to Asn at codon 169 causes instability in the protein, promotes oligomer formation and dramatically potentiates fibril formation. The doubly mutated protein exhibits more complex folding and <b>misfolding</b> behaviour than either single mutant, suggestive of differential effects of the β 2 –α 2 loop sequence on both protein stability and on specific <b>misfolding</b> pathways. Molecular dynamics simulation of protein structure suggests a key role for the solvent accessibility of Tyr 168 in promoting molecular interactions that may lead to prion protein <b>misfolding.</b> Thus, we conclude that ‘rigidity’ in the β 2 –α 2 loop region of the normal conformer of PrP has less effect on <b>misfolding</b> than other sequence-related effects in this region...|$|R
40|$|To those {{readers that}} already got the Protein <b>misfolding</b> and disease volume, this new title can sound as an update or a second {{edition of the}} {{previous}} volume: well, {{this is not the}} case. To those colleagues that would like to enter the fascinating field of protein’s <b>misfolding</b> this new volume constitutes an excellent opportunity to be driven on the causes and mechanisms that are actually know to produce the <b>misfolding.</b> For both types of scientists this volume is a must: the subtitle already sounds as a warning since it reads concepts and protocols rather than methods and protocols.

40|$|Mutations in {{the gene}} {{encoding}} parkin (PARK 2) result in familial early onset forms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{based on the}} loss of parkin’s E 3 ubiquitin ligase function. Protein <b>misfolding</b> is a common molecular feature of most neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. To test whether parkin <b>misfolding</b> also {{plays a role in}} the more common spontaneous PD, we established and functionally characterized a parkin yeast model. We found that oxidative and protein folding stress, parkin point mutations and truncations, and parkin’s interaction with the PD-associated kinase PINK 1 profoundly alter parkin’s subcellular localization and toxicity. Notably, these conditions also induce parkin fragmentation, degradation, and potentially <b>misfolding,</b> all of which may contribute to PD pathogenesis. Future research presents great potential to establish parkin <b>misfolding</b> as a promising new therapeutic target for PD...|$|R
5|$|Research into fungal prions {{has given}} strong {{support to the}} protein-only concept, since {{purified}} protein extracted from cells with a prion state has been demonstrated to convert the normal form of the protein into a <b>misfolded</b> form in vitro, and in the process, preserve the information corresponding to different strains of the prion state. It has also {{shed some light on}} prion domains, which are regions in a protein that promote the conversion into a prion. Fungal prions have helped to suggest mechanisms of conversion that may apply to all prions, though fungal prions appear distinct from infectious mammalian prions in the lack of cofactor required for propagation. The characteristic prion domains may vary between species—e.g., characteristic fungal prion domains are not found in mammalian prions.|$|E
5|$|Specifically, {{aggregation}} of TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein, {{has been}} found in ALS/MND patients, and mutations in the genes coding for these proteins have been identified in familial cases of ALS/MND. These mutations promote the misfolding of the proteins into a prion-like conformation. The <b>misfolded</b> form of TDP-43 forms cytoplasmic inclusions in afflicted neurons, and is found depleted in the nucleus. In addition to ALS/MND and FTLD-U, TDP-43 pathology is a feature of many cases of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. The misfolding of TDP-43 is largely directed by its prion-like domain. This domain is inherently prone to misfolding, while pathological mutations in TDP-43 have been found to increase this propensity to misfold, explaining the presence of these mutations in familial cases of ALS/MND. As in yeast, the prion-like domain of TDP-43 {{has been shown to be}} both necessary and sufficient for protein misfolding and aggregation.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are an {{essential}} component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within biological cells. They often act as enzymes, performing biochemical reactions including cell signaling, molecular transportation, and cellular regulation. As structural elements, some proteins act {{as a type of}} skeleton for cells, and as antibodies, while other proteins participate in the immune system. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional three-dimensional structure, a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its amino acid sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its native state. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of computational biology. Despite folding occurring within a crowded cellular environment, it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may misfold, that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold <b>misfolded</b> proteins, they can subsequently aggregate and cause a variety of debilitating diseases. Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.|$|E

40|$|Alpha-synuclein (a-Syn) is a 140 aa {{presynaptic}} protein which {{belongs to}} a group of natively unfolded proteins that are unstructured in aqueous solutions. The aggregation rate of a-Syn is accelerated in the presence of physiological levels of cellular polyamines. Here we applied single molecule AFM force spectroscopy to characterize the effect of spermidine on the very first stages of a-Syn aggregation – <b>misfolding</b> and assembly into dimers. Two a-Syn variants, the wild-type (WT) protein and A 30 P, were studied. The two protein molecules were covalently immobilized at the C-terminus, one at the AFM tip and the other on the substrate, and intermolecular interactions between the two molecules were measured by multiple approach-retraction cycles. At conditions close to physiological ones at which a-Syn <b>misfolding</b> is a rare event, the addition of spermidine leads to a dramatic increase in the propensity of the WT and mutant proteins to <b>misfold.</b> Importantly, <b>misfolding</b> is characterized by a set of conformations, and A 30 P changes the <b>misfolding</b> pattern as well as the strength of the intermolecular interactions. Together with the fact that spermidine facilitates late stages of a-Syn aggregation, our data demonstrate that spermidine promotes the very early stages of protein aggregation including a-Syn <b>misfolding</b> and dimerization.
