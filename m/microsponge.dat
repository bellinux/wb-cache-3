40|$|ABSTRACT: Flutrimazole {{is a wide}} {{spectrum}} antifungal drug. It {{is used for the}} topical treatment of superficial mycoses of the skin. Conventional topical products typically provide active ingredients in relatively high concentrations but with a short duration of action. <b>Microsponge</b> Systems are designed to allow a sustained rate of release of the active ingredients, offering a potential reduction in side effects while maintaining their therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to produce microsponges containing flutrimazole which were able to control the release of drug to the skin. Compatibility of drug with formulation components were established by Differential Scanning Colorimetry (DSC) and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR). Microsponges were prepared by using previously optimized emulsion solvent diffusion method. Shape and surface morphology were examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Drug content, particle size analysis and loading yield were determined in the prepared microparticles. The micrograph revealed microporous nature of microsponges. It was shown that the drug: polymer ratio, stirring rate, volume of dispersed phase influenced the particle size and drug release behavior of the formed microsponges.

The formulation (F 1) with least particle size of 54 ± 2. 37 µm, entrapment efficiency of 65. 98 ± 2. 21 % and CDR of 88. 15 ± 1. 59 % at 8 h that followed zero order release kinetics was selected as optimized formulation. F 1 was re-fabricated as bioadhesive <b>microsponges</b> (BF 1) using Acconon MC 8 - 2 and assessed.   The particle size of BF 1 increased to 84 ± 2. 29 µm whereas the entrapment efficiency lowered to 55. 19 ± 1. 36 % in comparison to F 1. However, the CDR 8 h from BF 1 (81. 65 ± 3. 37 %) was comparable to F 1. Dynamic in vitro bioadhesion test confirmed the bioadhesive property of BF 1. Ex vivo permeation across gastric mucin depicted 52. 87 % CDP 8 h that followed zero order kinetics (r 2 = 0. 9885). Scanning electron microscopy revealed spherical and highly porous surface. The FTIR studies revealed no chemical interaction between drug and excipients. Hence, the study affirmed the bioadhesive characteristics of Acconon MC 8 - 2 EP/NF for development of controlled release biaodhesive floating <b>microsponges</b> of loratadine...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the in vitro characteristics of mefenamic acid (MA) microparticles {{as well as}} their effects on DNA damage. MA-loaded chitosan and alginate beads were prepared by the ionotropic gelation process. <b>Microsponges</b> containing MA and Eudragit RS 100 were prepared by quasi-emulsion solvent diffusion method. The microparticles were characterized in terms of particle size, surface morphology, encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release profiles. Most of the formulation variables manifested an influence on the physical characteristics of the microparticles at varying degrees. We also studied the effects of MA, MA-loaded microparticles, and three different polymers on rat brain cortex DNA damage. Our results showed that DNA damage was higher in MA-loaded Eudragit <b>microsponges</b> than MA-loaded biodegradable chitosan or alginate microparticles...|$|R
40|$|The {{work was}} aimed at {{developing}} novel enteric coated HPMC capsules (ECHC) plugged with 5 Florouracil (5 -FU) loaded <b>Microsponges</b> in combination with calcium pectinate beads. Modified quasi-emulsion solvent diffusion method was used to formulate <b>microsponges</b> based on 32 factorial design {{and the effects of}} independent variables (volume of organic solvent and Eudragit RS 100 content) on the dependent variables (Particle size, %EE & % CDR) were determined. The optimized <b>microsponges</b> (F 4) were characterized by SEM, PXRD, TGA and were plugged along with calcium pectinate beads in HPMC capsules and the HPMC capsules were further coated with enteric polymer Eudragit L 100 (Ed-L 100) and/ or Eudrgit S 100 (Ed-S 100) in different proportions. In vitro release study of ECHC was performed in various release media sequentially SGF for 2 h, followed by SIF for the next 6 h and then in SCF (in the presence and absence of pectinase enzyme for further 16 h). Drug release was retarded on coating with EdS- 100 in comparison to blend of EdS- 100 : EdL- 100 coating. The percentage of 5 -FU released at the end of 24 h from ECHC 3 was 97. 83 ± 0. 12 % in the presence of pectinase whereas in control study it was 40. 08 ± 0. 02 % drug. The optimized formulation was subjected to in vivo Roentgenographic studies in New Zealand white rabbits to analyze the in vivo behavior of the developed colon targeted capsules. Pharmacokinetic studies in New Zealand white rabbits were conducted {{to determine the extent of}} systemic exposure provided by the developed formulation in comparison to 5 -FU aqueous solutions. Thus, enteric coated HPMC capsules plugged with 5 -FU loaded <b>microsponges</b> and calcium pectinate beads proved to be promising dosage form for colon targeted drug delivery to treat colorectal cancer...|$|R
