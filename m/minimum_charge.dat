25|$|Water {{and sewer}} tariffs in Jordan are {{differentiated}} by geographic area, {{type of use}} and volume of use. In areas served by public companies - the governorates of Amman, Aqaba, Irbid, Jerash, Ajloun and Mafraq - tariffs are {{higher than in the}} rest of the country where services are provided by WAJ. Residential water and sewer tariffs use an increasing-block system, under which users pay a higher tariff per m3 if they consume more water. The first block, corresponding to a consumption of 18m3 per quarter, is a <b>minimum</b> <b>charge</b> independent of the amount of water consumed. Water and sewer tariffs for non-residential use (commercial and industrial users) are about ten to twenty times higher respectively than residential water and sewer tariffs in the lowest consumption block.|$|E
25|$|Powder {{is another}} {{significant}} cost of reloading, and one {{over which the}} handloader has significant control. In addition to the obvious step of using a <b>minimum</b> <b>charge,</b> rather than a full power one, significant cost savings may be obtained through careful powder choice. Given the same bullet and cartridge, a faster burning powder will generally use a smaller charge of powder than required with a slower powder. For example, a 44 Magnum firing a 240-grain lead semi-wadcutter could be loaded with either Accurate Arms #2, a very fast pistol powder, or #9, a very slow pistol powder. When using the minimum loads, 9.0 grains (0.58 g) of AA #2 yield a velocity of 1126ft/s (343m/s), and 19.5 grains (1.26 g) of #9 yield 1364ft/s (416m/s). For {{the same amount of}} powder, AA #2 can produce approximately twice as many rounds, yet both powders cost the same per weight.|$|E

25|$|In areas {{served by}} public companies, as of 2015, the {{residential}} <b>minimum</b> <b>charge</b> was JD5.22/quarter {{for water and}} sewerage. This corresponds to an average water tariff of JD0.14/m3 and a sewer tariff of JD0.04/m3 for 18m3 per quarter. For a consumption level of 36m3 per quarter the average water and sewer tariff was JD0.24/m3 and JD0.14/m3 respectively. The tariff for each next m3 increases until it reaches JD1.92/m3 and JD1.11/m3 respectively for water and sewerage at a consumption of more than 122 m3/quarter. Tariffs for non-residential customers were JD1.30/m3 and 0,87 m3 respectively above a consumption of 6 m3/quarter, independently {{of the level of}} consumption. There is also a sewerage tax that is set at 3% of the assessed property value, which is charged in addition to the sewer tariff. Despite rising property values the sewerage tax revenue has remained constant for many years at JD15m per year, representing less than 10% of water revenues.|$|E
25|$|The average water tariff {{reported}} in 2014 was KSh 60 or US$0.60 per m3. This figure {{is not very}} indicative because of significant regional variations and because in Kenya a progressive block tariff system is in place for household connections. This means {{that for the first}} 10 m3 a <b>minimum</b> <b>charge</b> is paid that corresponds to a low, highly subsidised tariff, while for the following blocks (up to 20, 50, 100 and 300 as well as above 300 m3) an increasingly higher tariff is being charged, with the tariff in the highest block being five times higher than in the lowest block. Where no meter is installed, a fixed monthly charge is applied. The rationale for this system is to promote water saving practices and to ensure that low-income households can afford to use an adequate amount of water. However, there are problems with this system, because households in low-income areas resell water or share a connection with other households and thus risk ending up paying a higher tariff.|$|E
