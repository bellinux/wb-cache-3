40|$|This article answers three questions. To {{what extent}} do Dutch workers voluntarily change {{employers}} or positions within the firm, do objective and subjectively experienced job characteristics influence voluntary mobility, and does voluntary mobility result in changes in these job characteristics? Analyses show that voluntary mobility occurs quite often. Objective job characteristics do not predict the odds of voluntary mobility. The subjective evaluation of aspects of the job, such as for instance the job in general, the income, the job content and colleagues, and workload, however, do. The stronger this mismatch of persons and jobs, the more likely one is to be voluntarily <b>mobile.</b> <b>Panel</b> analyses furthermore show that this voluntary mobility improves objective job characteristics such as income and status, and reduces an unfavourable evaluation of the person–job fit. Clearly, an unfavourably experienced person–job fit pushes workers out of their jobs, and on average this step brings positive returns. ...|$|E

The data collection methodology used in the Dutch <b>Mobile</b> Mobility <b>Panel</b> comprised firstly {{the development of a}} smartphone application for iPhone and Android smartphones that automatically detects trips with its accompanying characteristics. Secondly, the trip data collected is enriched daily on a back-end server using data mining techniques to deduce suggestions for transport modes, places and trip purpose. In addition, additional data on weather conditions are added and errors in measurements are filtered out. Thirdly, an online follow up survey is conducted that enables participants to check and, if needed, revise trip characteristics or add or remove trips, and answer questions on specific travel conditions. Finally, participants fill in an online trip diary to report the trips for {{the first day of the}} field trial. This allows a comparison of the smartphone data collection with the conventional trip diary method.

40|$|Solar {{energy for}} the {{production}} of electric energy is one source of renewable energy which is experiencing most development in recent years. In countries with high solar radiation indices, as is the case of Spain, expectations of installation of large solar power plants are increasing. Most solar power plants are located in rural environments, where the landscape has remained practically unaltered ever since extensive agriculture was introduced. Because of this, {{one of the most significant}} environmental impacts of this type of installation is the visual impact derived from the alteration of the landscape. In this work, an indicator is proposed for the quantification of the objective aesthetic impact, based on four criteria: visibility, colour, fractality and concurrence between fixed and <b>mobile</b> <b>panels.</b> The relative importance of each variable and the corresponding value functions are calculated using expert contribution. A study of the subjective aesthetic impact is then carried out using the semantic differential method, to obtain the perception of a sample of individuals of the initial landscapes and of the landscapes altered through the installation of a solar power plant. The indicator and the study of public perception are applied to five real solar power plants, to test their reliability. Subsequently, a different group of individuals is used to determine preferences between the five solar power plants. The study proves that the combined use of objective indicator and subjective study, faithfully explains user preferences corresponding to the combined comparisons of the five cases. It is concluded that the tools proposed for the evaluation of the aesthetic impact of solar power plants are useful for the selection of optimal plant location and most adequate use of panel technology, to minimise aesthetic impact.

In a second step a comparison was made to potential changes in travel behaviour of the observed persons. The results show that in those groups of persons where the mobile phone use was on a high level or even increased from a high level in 2003, travel behaviour in terms of travel frequency decreased less than for all other persons or even increased.

40|$|This {{presentation}} is an overview on Satellite Communication for the Aeronautical Telecommunication Management (ATM) research. Satellite Communications are being {{considered by the}} FAA and NASA as a possible alternative to {{the present and future}} ground systems supporting Air Traffic Communications. The international Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have in place Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS) for the Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Services (AMSS) which is mainly derived from the pre-existing Inmarsat service that has been in service since the 1980 s. The Working Group A of the Aeronautical <b>Mobile</b> Communication <b>Panel</b> of ICAO has also been investigating SARPS for what is called the Next Generation Satellite Service (NGSS) which conforms less to the Inmarsat based architecture and explores wider options in terms of satellite architectures. Several designs are being proposed by Firms such as Boeing, ESA, NASA that are geared toward full or secondary usage of satellite communications for ATM. Satellite communications for ATM can serve several purposes ranging from primary usage where ground services would play a minimal backup role, to an integrated solution where it will be used to cover services, or areas that {{are less likely to be}} supported by the proposed and existing ground infrastructure. Such Integrated roles can include usage of satellite communications for oceanic and remote land areas for example. It also can include relieving the capacity of the ground network by providing broadcast based services of Traffic Information Services messages (TIS-B), or Flight Information Services (FIS-B) which can take a significant portion of the ground system capacity. Additionally, satellite communication can play a backup role to support any needs for ground replacement, or additional needed capacity even after the new digital systems are in place. The additional bandwidth that can be provided via satellite communications can also open the door for many new applications that generally will enhance the standard services provided. All of those possibilities were investigated and comments, as well as descriptions of those analyses are put forward, as well as suggestions for future areas of study...|$|R

Many benefits are conceivable: Artificial lab envi-ronments can use more realistic designs and improve cost efficiency and “time to market” factors.

40|$|Intelligent environments, such {{as smart}} homes or domotic systems, have the {{potential}} to support people in many of their ordinary activities, by allowing complex control strategies for managing various capabilities of a house or a building: lights, doors, temperature, power and energy, music, etc. Such environments, typically, provide these control strategies by means of computers, touch screen <b>panels,</b> <b>mobile</b> phones, tablets, or In-House Displays. An unobtrusive and typically wearable device, like a bracelet or a wrist watch, that lets users perform various operations in their homes and to receive notifications from the environment, could strenghten the interaction with such systems, in particular for those people not accustomed to computer systems (e. g., elderly) or in contexts where they are not in front of a screen.
