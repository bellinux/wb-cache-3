5|$|Believing {{that the}} {{original}} game was too easy, Davis initiated development of Faster Harder <b>More</b> <b>Challenging</b> Q*bert (also known as FHMC Q*bert) in 1983, which increases the difficulty, introduces Q*bertha and adds a bonus round. Finally, the project was canceled and the game never entered production. Davis later released FHMC Q*berts ROM image onto the web.|$|E

5|$|Many {{children}} with AS are initially misdiagnosed with {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD). Diagnosing adults is <b>more</b> <b>challenging,</b> as standard diagnostic criteria are designed for children and the expression of AS changes with age. Adult diagnosis requires painstaking clinical examination and thorough medical history gained from both the individual and other people who know the person, focusing on childhood behavior.|$|E

Extensive training is provided through a multi-disciplinary team to modify behaviours and improve independent living skills so that some may eventually be transferred to sheltered workshops or even prepared for open employment.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, {{professional}} historians began to reevaluate the force's history. A wider set of themes, including social, {{race and class}} issues, began to be analysed, resulting in <b>more</b> <b>challenging</b> histories of the force being published. Legal challenges brought before the Canadian courts in the 1980s resulted in the release of archive material about the force's role in the First World War for the first time, generating further new lines of research.|$|E

A coach must {{have at least one}} timeout remaining in order to challenge (teams receive three timeouts per half). If the challenge is successful and the on-field ruling is overturned, the team keeps its timeout and is allowed only one <b>more</b> <b>challenge.</b> If unsuccessful, the team loses its timeout and is allowed no <b>more</b> <b>challenges.</b>|$|R

The patch also added in an option to disable the use of Vita-Chambers, a feature requested by players to make the game <b>more</b> <b>challenging,</b> as well as an achievement to complete the game at its hardest setting without using a Vita-Chamber.|$|E
5|$|Modem Wars, {{released}} in 1988 for DOS and the Commodore 64, {{was the first}} RTS with multiplayer games by means of modems. Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, which allow two gamers to compete by modem or local networks, persuaded a wider audience that multiplayer competition was much <b>more</b> <b>challenging</b> than contests against the artificial intelligence (AI), and made multiplayer facilities essential for future RTS titles.|$|E
5|$|Much of the inter-war period saw {{economic}} recession or stagnant growth, making fund-raising <b>more</b> <b>challenging.</b> Partially as a result, many memorial projects {{had to be}} cut back or altered {{due to lack of}} money. The final size of Douaumont had to be cut in size by a third when fund-raising slowed. Proposals to turn the planned Imperial War Museum into a grand memorial for the war dead were shelved due to lack of funds.|$|E

5|$|The Liberty Ridge Route, grade IV, {{was first}} climbed by Ome Daiber, Arnie Campbell and Jim Burrow in 1935 and {{is listed as}} one of the Fifty Classic Climbs of North America by Steve Roper and Allen Steck. The Liberty Ridge Route is a {{considerably}} <b>more</b> <b>challenging</b> and objectively dangerous route than the normal route to the summit. This route only accounts for approximately 2% of climbers on the mountain, but accounts for approximately 25% of deaths on the mountain. The Liberty Ridge Route runs up the center of the North Face of Mount Rainier and crosses the very active Carbon Glacier.|$|E
5|$|The South West Coast Path is England's longest waymarked long-distance {{footpath}} and a National Trail. It stretches for , {{running from}} Minehead in Somerset, along {{the coasts of}} Devon and Cornwall, to Poole Harbour in Dorset. Since it rises and falls with every river mouth, {{it is also one}} of the <b>more</b> <b>challenging</b> trails. The total height climbed has been calculated to be 114,931ft (35,031m), almost four times the height of Mount Everest. It has been voted 'Britain's Best Walking route' twice in a row by readers of the Ramblers Walk magazine, and regularly features in lists of the world's best walks.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{plays out}} through 26 missions, with story scenes that tie the plot together occurring between {{and during the}} battles. In addition, 38 training missions are unlocked as the missions are completed. The training missions are <b>more</b> <b>challenging,</b> entirely optional, and can be played separately from the campaign. One new feature in Days of Ruin is that campaign missions can now be played individually as the player completes them. Like the training missions, campaign missions can be selected {{from the main menu}} at any time.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} strives {{to find the}} {{challenges}} faced by children of HIVpatients. The samples were taken from a NGO organization in Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu. A random sample of 80 children of HIV patients who were distributed as 40 infected children and 40 affected children were chosen for the study. Each of these 40 children were further divided into 20 boys and 20 girls. The tool used for the study was formulated by the investigator. The result of the study revealed that boys of HIV patients generally face <b>more</b> <b>challenges</b> {{when compared with the}} girls. When effect of age was studied on the challenges faced by children of HIV patients it was found that both the age groups studied faced {{more or less the same}} level of challenges except between 12 - 15 and 16 - 19 year old affected boys where the 16 - 19 year old boys were found to face <b>more</b> <b>challenges.</b> When a comparison was made between the infected and affected children a significant difference was noted between the infected and affected girls, where the infected girls were found to be facing <b>more</b> <b>challenges</b> than the affected girls. Again a significant difference was noted between infected and affected boys where the affected boys in the age group of 16 - 19 years were found to be facing <b>more</b> <b>challenges.</b> No difference was found between the other groups studied...|$|R
5|$|The {{documentary}} {{was generally}} well-received, and garnered its TVTV production team the 1974 Alfred I. du Pont/Columbia University Award in Broadcast Journalism. The documentary received a negative {{review in the}} New York Post, and positive reviews in The New York Times, The Boston Globe, the Los Angeles Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times. The San Francisco Bay Guardian wrote that the TVTV team had improved since their previous work but wanted them {{to move on to}} <b>more</b> <b>challenging</b> subjects.|$|E
5|$|After {{assuming}} his new position, Treloar {{was sent}} to AIF Headquarters in the Middle East where Australian forces were engaged in the North African Campaign. While {{en route to the}} Middle East he visited Malaya. Conditions in North Africa proved <b>more</b> <b>challenging</b> than those in World War I, however, as the combat was fast-moving and the Australian troops felt less motivation to collect artefacts than those of the First AIF. Treloar was supported by a small staff, but fell out with his second in command who questioned both how he administered the unit and his personal efficiency. He also lacked a patron in the AIF and was handicapped by his relatively junior rank. Due to his absence from the Memorial, Treloar had only limited input into the design of its galleries and he was unable to attend its official opening in November 1941.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was <b>more</b> <b>challenging</b> because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E

5|$|Dishonored 2 was {{released}} {{to a positive}} reception. Praised were the improvements made since the first game: the <b>more</b> <b>challenging</b> stealth, the adaptability of Emily and Corvo's abilities to both play styles, the art direction, the creative design of individual missions, {{the realization of the}} game's world as well as the replay-value and the artificial intelligence. Criticism was directed at the lack of focus of the overarching narrative. Aside from this, technical blunders as well as issues with the PC version were received unfavorably. Dishonored 2 won the award for Best Action/Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2016 and for Costume Design at the 2017 NAVGTR Awards.|$|E
5|$|During the House of Representatives {{debate on}} the report, the Minister, Larry Anthony, stated that he had already asked fuel {{companies}} to check their tanker wagons {{for the presence of}} water after each replenishment, and the relevant Air Navigation Order would be amended to require fuel to be drained into transparent containers. He stated that his Department did not intend to amend the relevant Air Navigation Order to require pilots of four-engine aeroplanes to perform the periodic checks in a four-engine aeroplane because it considered it was <b>more</b> <b>challenging</b> to fly with one engine inoperative in a two-engine aeroplane than in a four-engine aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year the}} event has a theme, and {{includes}} a cocktail hour and a formal dinner. During the cocktail hour, guests arrive {{to walk on the}} red carpet, tour the year's special themed exhibition, and be seated before the dinner party that includes entertainment from the preeminent entertainers of the day. The theme not only sets the tone for the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold the theme of the year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, the theme is a bit befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 the theme may be far <b>more</b> <b>challenging</b> to one gender than the other.|$|E
