Cultures were positive with the conventional culture <b>method</b> <b>in</b> 11 (35 %) episodes and with the blood culture bottle <b>method</b> <b>in</b> 26 (84 %) episodes (P less than 0. 001). The lysis-centrifugation tube method was compared with the blood culture bottle <b>method</b> <b>in</b> 24 episodes of SBP. Cultures were positive with the lysis-centrifugation tube <b>method</b> <b>in</b> 11 (46 %) episodes and with the blood culture bottle <b>method</b> <b>in</b> 19 (79 %) episodes (P less than 0. 05). Moreover, the blood culture bottle method also shortened the time needed {{for the detection of}} bacterial growth. In conclusion, bedside inoculation of ascites into blood culture bottles should be used routinely for patients with suspected SBP. Culturing of ascites in lysis-centrifugation tubes is more laborious than and inferior to that in blood culture bottles...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The {{conventional}} deconvolution {{method for}} two-dimensional image restoration is considered. The algorithm of conventional deconvolution <b>method</b> <b>in</b> basis of Hadamard transformation is proposed. The problem statement. The examples of standard image restoration by conventional deconvolution <b>method</b> <b>in</b> Hadamard transformation field with different level of additive noise are given. The results of restoration in Fourier and Hadamard transformation fields {{at the same}} level of additive noise are shown for comparison. Conclusions. Realization of conventional deconvolution <b>method</b> <b>in</b> basis of Hadamard transformation gives the results similar to restoration results using discrete Fourier transformation. Herewith there is no Gibbs effect and basis of Hadamard transformation is convenient for archiving images. The conventional deconvolution <b>method</b> <b>in</b> Hadamard transformation field is rather simple, requires less computation time and less number of arithmetic operations in comparison with image restoration <b>method</b> <b>in</b> natural coordinates. ?????????? ????? ???????? ???????????? ??? ??????????? ????????? ???????. ????????? ???????? ?????? ???????? ???????????? ? ?????? ???????????? ?????????????? ???????. ????????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ???????? ???????????? ? ??????? ???????????? ?????????????? ??????? ? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ????. ??? ????????? ????????? ????????? ??????????? ? ??????? ?????????????? ????? ? ? ??????? ?????????????? ??????? ??? ????? ? ??? ?? ?????? ??????????? ????...|$|R
