5|$|The evacuation, {{which had}} been delayed for months, was {{initiated}} due to fear of the Red Army advances during the East Prussian Offensive. Some parts of the evacuation were planned as a <b>military</b> <b>necessity,</b> Operation Hannibal being the most important military operation involved in the evacuation. However, many refugees took to the roads on their own initiative because of reported Soviet atrocities against Germans in the areas under Soviet control. Both spurious and factual accounts of Soviet atrocities were disseminated through the official news and propaganda outlets of Nazi Germany and by rumors that swept through the military and civilian populations.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{investment}} in the defense sector was not driven by <b>military</b> <b>necessity,</b> but {{in large part by}} the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges. The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in {{the world in terms of}} the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their military–industrial base. However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West. For example, the Persian Gulf War demonstrated how the armor, fire control systems and firing range of the Soviet's most common main battle tank, the T-72, were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams, yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T-72's as the US deployed M1's.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{called for}} {{unconditional}} Japanese surrender in the Potsdam Declaration of 27 July, but the Japanese government rejected the call. In early August, the USAAF dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Allies justified the atomic bombings as a <b>military</b> <b>necessity</b> to avoid invading the Japanese home islands which {{would cost the}} lives of between 250,000 and 500,000 Allied servicemen and millions of Japanese troops and civilians. Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement, invaded Japanese-held Manchuria, and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army, which was the largest Japanese fighting force. The Red Army also captured Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. On 15 August 1945, Japan surrendered, with the surrender documents finally signed at Tokyo Bay {{on the deck of}} the American battleship USS Missouri on 2 September 1945, ending the war.|$|E

5|$|South Pacific Air Lines (SPAL) {{had been}} granted {{permission}} by the United States and British governments to operate a flying boat service from Christmas Island. Patrick Dean asked the British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Roger Makins to sound out the U.S. government about terminating the contract. Makins reported in March 1956 that Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was willing to help {{so long as the}} dormant American claim to the island was not prejudiced. The lease on the island facilities, including the airfield and the port, {{had been granted}} to SPAL with a clause in the contract that said it could be terminated if there was a <b>military</b> <b>necessity</b> to do so. The Americans proposed that the British tell SPAL that they were establishing an airbase on the island, and that the United States would support this so long as SPAL was paid fair compensation. An official letter was sent to the president of SPAL on 1 May 1956, withdrawing the permit to operate from Christmas Island, regretting any inconvenience, and offering to consider compensation.|$|E
25|$|War crimes for {{the same}} reasons, and for wanton {{destruction}} and devastation not justified by <b>military</b> <b>necessity.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the war, {{these crimes}} were tried at {{what became known}} as the Doctors' Trial, and revulsion at the abuses perpetrated led to the {{development}} of the Nuremberg Code of medical ethics. The Nazi physicians in the Doctors' trial argued that <b>military</b> <b>necessity</b> justified their torturous experiments, and compared their victims to collateral damage from Allied bombings. But this defense, which was in any case rejected by the Tribunal, cannot apply to the twin experiments of Josef Mengele, which were performed on children and had no connection to <b>military</b> <b>necessity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kalinin would {{emphasize}} his own peasant background {{when speaking}} to rural audiences, calling village meetings and inquiring about requisition payments and land redistribution — sensitive matters {{of great concern}} to the poor farming– population. The negative effects of Soviet policy were explained as <b>military</b> <b>necessities</b> and passionate appeals {{were made to the}} peasantry to voluntarily participate in the grain requisition process to make food available to the starving and depopulating cities.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the extreme}} {{measures}} taken by the consuls, however, {{it is likely that}} considerable urban unrest predicated this reform. With both the urban and the rural sections of the populace clamouring for reform and the <b>military</b> <b>necessities</b> of manpower granting the plebs a strong negotiating position, the law entered the realm of the inevitable. Of course, necessary to pass such specific and controlling legislation was an organised movement, likely coordinated by the plebeian tribunes in the city.|$|R
50|$|On 1 November 1968, President Lyndon Baines Johnson {{declared}} {{a halt to}} the bombing of North Vietnam. With that act, the focus of the contending forces became the Ho Chi Minh Trail. As the U.S. more than quadrupled the number of airstrikes aimed at interdiction, North Vietnamese anti-aircraft guns and gunners transferred south to the Trail to match this new onslaught. Both sides realized that the supply of <b>military</b> <b>necessities</b> being moved south to insurgents would be crucial to a communist victory.|$|R
25|$|In August 1945 American {{military}} {{air forces}} dropped atomic bombs on {{the cities of}} Hiroshima (6 August) and of Nagasaki (9 August).

25|$|Most of the Whites {{involved}} in the project felt that black ownership of the land should be its final result. Saxton—along with journalists including Free South editor James G.

In January 1863, Saxton unilaterally halted the Treasury Department's tax sale on the grounds of <b>military</b> <b>necessity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Scottish Reformation in 1560 {{established}} {{a government that}} was friendly to England and this resulted in less <b>military</b> <b>necessity</b> to maintain a fleet of great ships. With the Union of the Crowns in 1603, the incentive to rebuild a separate royal fleet for Scotland diminished further since James VI now controlled the powerful English Royal Navy, which could send ships north to defend Scottish interests, and which now opened its ranks to Scottish officers.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Congress {{established}} the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) {{to study the}} matter. On February 24, 1983, the commission issued a report entitled Personal Justice Denied, condemning the internment as unjust and motivated by racism and xenophobic ideas rather than factual <b>military</b> <b>necessity.</b> Internment camp survivors sued {{the federal government for}} $24 million in property loss, but lost the case. However, the Commission recommended that $20,000 in reparations be paid to those Japanese Americans who had suffered internment.|$|E
25|$|According to the Constitution of Artsakh {{the army}} is under the {{civilian}} command of the government. The Artsakh Defense Army was officially established on 9 May 1992 as a defense against Azerbaijan. It fought the Azerbaijani army to a ceasefire on 12 May 1994. Currently the Artsakh Defense Army consists of around 18,000–20,000 officers and soldiers. However, only 8,500 citizens from Artsakh serve in the NK army; some 10,000 come from Armenia. There are also 177–316 tanks, 256–324 additional fighting vehicles, and 291–322 guns and mortars. Armenia supplies arms and other <b>military</b> <b>necessities</b> to Artsakh. Several battalions of Armenia's army are deployed directly in the Artsakh zone on occupied Azerbaijani territory.|$|R
50|$|Born in Ottawa, Illinois, Wagner {{graduated}} from West Point in 1875 {{near the bottom}} of his class with a commission in the infantry. While serving on the frontier, Wagner saw action during campaigns against the Sioux and Nez Perce from 1876 until 1877, and the Utes in 1881. Entering military education while assigned as a professor of military science and tactics at the Louisiana State University and East Florida Seminary, Wagner would win high praise from the Military Service Institution of the United States, and greatly increased his prominence as one of the leading military scholar, for his monograph The <b>Military</b> <b>Necessities</b> of the United States, and the Best Method of Meeting Them in 1884.|$|R
25|$|As a Southerner {{and friend}} of Davis, Northrop {{resigned}} his United States commission in January 1861 to join the secessionist colors. After Davis's election as Confederate president, the new commander-in-chief promoted Northrop {{to the rank of}} colonel; in March 1861, the Confederate War Department appointed him to the post of Commissary-General. In this office, Northrop was responsible for logistical services, including the transport of <b>military</b> <b>necessities</b> (other than arms and ammunition) to the Confederate armies, the movement of Confederate units from point to point along the battle front, and the supply of necessities to members of the Union Army confined to Southern prisoner-of-war camps. Northrop served in this role from March 1861 until February 1865, when he was removed from office.|$|R
25|$|In 1897, Roberts {{traveled}} the entire stretch of rocky coast from Carmel to San Simeon, and photographed the land, {{becoming the first}} surveyor of the route. He initially promoted the road for allowing access to a region of spectacular beauty. Roberts was only successful in gaining attention to the project when State Senator Elmer S. Rigdon, {{a member of the}} California Senate Committee on Roads and Highways, promoted the <b>military</b> <b>necessity</b> of defending California's coast. A $1.5million bond issue was placed on the ballot, but construction was delayed by World War I.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of this {{position}} {{argue that the}} devastation from firebombing was greater than {{anything that could be}} justified by <b>military</b> <b>necessity</b> alone, and this establishes a prima facie case. The Allies were aware of the effects of firebombing, as British cities had been subject to them during the Blitz. Proponents disagree that Dresden had a military garrison and claim that most of the industry was in the outskirts and not in the targeted city centre, and that the cultural significance of the city should have precluded the Allies from bombing it.|$|E
25|$|In May 2011, U.S. Solicitor General Neal Katyal, {{after a year}} of investigation, found Charles Fahy had {{intentionally}} withheld The Ringle Report {{drafted by}} the Office of Naval Intelligence, in order to justify the Roosevelt administration's actions in the cases of Hirabayashi v. United States and Korematsu v. United States. The report would have undermined the administration's position of the <b>military</b> <b>necessity</b> for such action, as it concluded that most Japanese Americans were not a national security threat, and that allegations of communication espionage had been found to be without basis by the FBI and Federal Communications Commission.|$|E
40|$|The Allied {{bombing of}} France between 1940 and 1945 has {{received}} comparatively little attention from historians, although the civilian death toll, at about 60, 000, was {{comparable to that}} of German raids on the UK.

It argues that while British policymakers were sensitive to the delicate political implications of attacking France, perceived <b>military</b> <b>necessities</b> tended to trump political misgivings; that Vichy, before November 1942, was a stronger constraint on Allied bombing than the Free French at any time and that the bombing programme largely escaped political control from May 1944...|$|R

25|$|The {{action of}} the Red Cross and other {{humanitarian}} societies was facilitated by their official recognition through the Second Hague Convention: “Relief societies for prisoners of war, which are properly constituted {{in accordance with the}} laws of their country and with the object of serving as the channel for charitable effort shall receive from the belligerents, for themselves and their duly accredited agents every facility for the efficient performance of their humane task within the bounds imposed by <b>military</b> <b>necessities</b> and administrative regulations.

25|$|On December 18, 1944, the Supreme Court {{handed down}} two {{decisions}} on {{the legality of the}} incarceration under Executive Order 9066. Korematsu v. United States, a 6–3 decision upholding a Nisei's conviction for violating the military exclusion order, stated that, in general, the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast was constitutional. However, Ex parte Endo unanimously declared that loyal citizens of the United States, regardless of cultural descent, could not be detained without cause. In effect, the two rulings held that, while the eviction of U.S. citizens in the name of <b>military</b> <b>necessity</b> was legal, the subsequent incarceration was not—thus paving the way for their release.|$|E

50|$|Three {{years after}} Cao Cao {{defeated}} Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, Cheng Yu recruited and enlisted several thousand robbers and inhabitants of deep hills around Yan Province, {{and led them}} to rendezvous with Cao Cao in Liyang, where Cao Cao {{had set up a}} front line military operation base against Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang. Along with Li Dian, Cheng Yu transported grain to Cao Cao by ships. Once, the supply line was blocked by the Grand Administrator of Wei Commandery, Gao Fan, who capitalized on the geographic advantage. Cao Cao then ordered Cheng Yu to abandon the waterway and transport through other routes. But Li Dian reasoned with Cheng Yu that Gao Fan could be defeated because he was lightly guarded with a small army. Therefore, they violated Cao Cao's order, and landed the northern bank and defeated Gao Fan, resulting in the smooth delivery of <b>military</b> <b>necessities.</b>|$|R
50|$|For much of {{the eighteenth}} century, France {{approached}} its wars in the same way. It would let its colonies defend themselves, or would offer only minimal help (sending them only limited numbers of troops or inexperienced soldiers), anticipating that fights for the colonies would likely be lost anyway. This strategy was, to a degree, forced upon France: geography, coupled with {{the superiority of the}} British navy, made it difficult for the French navy to provide significant supplies and support to French colonies. Similarly, several long land borders made an effective domestic army imperative for any ruler of France. Given these <b>military</b> <b>necessities,</b> the French government, unsurprisingly, based its strategy overwhelmingly on the army in Europe: it would keep most of its army on the European continent, hoping that such a force would be victorious closer to home. At the end of the war, France gave back its European conquests, and recovered such lost overseas possessions as Louisbourg, largely restoring the status quo ante as far as France was concerned.|$|R
40|$|In a {{very short}} period, {{economic}} globalization has changed the world economic order, creating new challenges but also new possibilities.

During the 20 years of reform in Moldova, state policies have undergone into an essential metamorphosis: priorities have evolved gradually from fundamental science and <b>military</b> <b>necessities</b> to industrial and key technologies. Currently, it outlines a new stage, focusing on innovation and societal needs as a whole. An analysis of the sources of growth in Moldova in a classical representation of the production function Cob-Douglas suggests a very alarming conclusion - without a serious effort to change the paradigm of development, growth potential in the next 10 years is limited to a up to 4, 5 % to 5 % per year...|$|R
