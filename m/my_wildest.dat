500|$|In {{addition}} to the songs in the film, Ariel has new songs by Alan Menken and lyrics by Glenn Slater. [...] "The World Above" [...] is Ariel's introductory song, where she expresses her admiration and curiosity with the human world, [...] "Beyond <b>My</b> <b>Wildest</b> Dreams" [...] is performed after Ariel has become human and given up her voice, and is used to express her thoughts about the human world and Eric, and [...] "If Only (quartet)" [...] is a quartet between Ariel, Eric, King Triton and Sebastian where all four express longing and sadness for their current situation: Ariel saddened that she only has one day left to get Eric to kiss her, Eric's confusion of falling for Ariel despite longing for the mysterious girl who saved his life, King Triton's regret at driving Ariel away, and Sebastian for his inability to help Ariel achieve her dreams.|$|E
500|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the Tower of Joy, actor Robert Aramayo was cast to play a young Eddard Stark. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Aramayo stated {{that he was a}} big fan of the series, and that [...] "it was an honor and a gift {{to be able to be}} a part of it." [...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't want to get too hung up in sounding like Sean because I think that would've sort of got in my way if I'd have just situated all my work in that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in and I think that was the biggest help for me when creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is." [...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to be on the show was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was beyond <b>my</b> <b>wildest</b> dreams. Then when I found out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E

500|$|Businessweek {{attributed}} the sales success of Mandatory Fun to the viral music video campaign. ABC World News elaborated that Yankovic's success {{is in part}} due to the Internet's interest in viral and humorous videos catching up with what Yankovic has been doing for his entire career. Yankovic himself was amazed with the response he got from the album and video releases, stating that [...] "I've been doing the same thing for 30 years {{and all of a sudden}} I'm having the best week of my life" [...] and that he [...] "kind of stumbled on my formula for the future". He also stated, [...] "A No. 1 album is something I never had in <b>my</b> <b>wildest</b> dreams ever thought would be a reality." [...] The total collection of videos had acquired more than 46 million views within 10 days of the album's release, and six of the eight videos reached the top position on the Billboard Twitter Real-Time Trending 140 chart during that week. In contrast, Yankovic's video for [...] "Perform This Way", the lead single off Alpocalypse, only received 16.8 million views in the three years since its release, while an individual video from Mandatory Fun, like [...] "Tacky", received 12.8 million views within the first week.

2500|$|Carlisle {{confirmed}} {{in a radio}} interview in August 2015 that she has completed work on a new album, tentatively earmarked for release in January 2016. She commented that the music on the album will be partly inspired by Kundalini yoga, which she had taken up while pregnant in 1991/1992 and of which she had qualified as a teacher since becoming sober in 2005. Also in August 2015, Edsel released a box set of all the commercially released singles from Carlisle's studio albums, plus a bonus disc featuring a previously-unreleased recording of [...] "In <b>My</b> <b>Wildest</b> Dreams", which had featured in the 1987 film Mannequin.

He instead saw Brody get out and walk to the rear, apparently trying to free it. [...] "What struck me was how calm she was—she didn't seem to be panicking, or in a hurry at all, even though the gate was down," [...] he said later. [...] "She wasn't in a hurry at all, {{but she had to}} have known that a train was coming." [...] Brody looked at him, and he motioned to her to come back in his direction, although he allows that she may not have seen him due to the glare from his headlights. Brody then returned to her vehicle and, according to Hope, seemed to pause as if she was adjusting her seat belt. The train was getting closer and the situation more urgent.

2500|$|During the album's {{listening}} {{party on}} August 20, 2012 at Germano Studios in Manhattan, New York, Two Elevens executive producer Breyon Prescott revealed {{that there would}} be fifteen songs on the final track listing. Eleven of the songs were previewed at the album party but not all were completely mixed, mastered or finished. The album's first single [...] "Put It Down" [...] featuring Chris Brown has a distinctly hip-hop flavour, with Norwood taking on her [...] "rap-singing" [...] vocal performance she last used when assuming her persona of Bran'Nu on Timbaland's album Shock Value II (2009). The song is built around a [...] "mid-tempo thumping production" [...] courtesy of Bangladesh. Its co-writer and co-producer Sean Garrett revealed that [...] "Put It Down" [...] was a [...] "good segway" [...] to {{what the rest of the}} album would sound like. By contrast not all of Garrett's songs follow the same flow. The album's second single, titled [...] "Wildest Dreams", was also written by Garrett, but this time produced by The Bizzness. An introspective ballad, [...] "Wildest Dreams" [...] speaks about Norwood's losing out emotionally. Lyrics include the line [...] "Never in <b>my</b> <b>wildest</b> dreams did I think someone could care 'bout me/ Not just the way you love me, but you know I'm emotional (sometimes)." [...] During the course of the song, Norwood mentions herself several times, over the [...] "thawacking percussion" [...] and production.|$|E
2500|$|In general relativity, general {{covariance}} {{is intimately}} related to [...] "diffeomorphism invariance". This symmetry {{is one of}} the defining features of the theory. However, it is a common misunderstanding that [...] "diffeomorphism invariance" [...] refers to the invariance of the physical predictions of a theory under arbitrary coordinate transformations; this is untrue and in fact every physical theory is invariant under coordinate transformations this way. Diffeomorphisms, as mathematicians define them, correspond to something much more radical; intuitively a way they can be envisaged is as simultaneously dragging all the physical fields (including the gravitational field) over the bare differentiable manifold while staying in the same coordinate system. Diffeomorphisms are the true symmetry transformations of general relativity, and come about from the assertion that the formulation of the theory is based on a bare differentiable manifold, but not on any prior geometry — the theory is background-independent (this is a profound shift, as all physical theories before general relativity had as part of their formulation a prior geometry). What is preserved under such transformations are the coincidences between the values the gravitational field take at such and such a [...] "place" [...] and the values the matter fields take there. From these relationships one can form a notion of matter being located with respect to the gravitational field, or vice versa. This is what Einstein discovered: that physical entities are located with respect to one another only and not with respect to the spacetime manifold. As Carlo Rovelli puts it: [...] "No more fields on spacetime: just fields on fields". This is the true meaning of the saying [...] "The stage disappears and becomes one of the actors"; space-time as a [...] "container" [...] over which physics takes place has no objective physical meaning and instead the gravitational interaction is represented as just one of the fields forming the world. This is known as the relationalist interpretation of space-time. The realization by Einstein that general relativity should be interpreted this way is the origin of his remark [...] "Beyond <b>my</b> <b>wildest</b> expectations".|$|E

2500|$|The Reverend Leonard Jenyns, {{a naturalist}} Darwin had known since {{his time at}} the University of Cambridge, had at Darwin's request contributed the volume on Fish in Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, and was now {{working on a book}} of notes on {{observations}} of plants and animals. On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that [...] "work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts, which make one understand the working or œconomy of nature.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited." [...] He told Jenyns that he had [...] "continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. I know how much I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years." [...] In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him [...] "With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that I meant to say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in <b>my</b> <b>wildest</b> day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides {{to the question of the}} immutability of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals)." [...] He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about [...] "numerous immense difficulties on my notions" [...] told him that he had [...] "drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & if I thought at some future time, that you would think it worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic." [...] Jenyns never took up this offer to read the [...] "Essay", but did advise Darwin on possible issues with the term [...] "mutation". Darwin replied [...] "it will be years before I publish, so that I shall have plenty of time to think of better words".|$|E
