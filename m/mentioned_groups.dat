40|$|Introduction: Pray and mention as two {{separate}} methods are spiritual care. This {{study was designed}} to compare two methods of prayer and mentioning on life expectancy in patient hospitalization in CCU Ward Social Security Golestan Hospitals in 1393. Method: The following experimental study was performed on 90 patient hospitalization in Khatam Al Anbia Hospital which were divided into prayer <b>groups</b> (n= 30), <b>mentioning</b> (n= 30) and control group (n= 30). Intervention was performed in Prayer and <b>mentioning</b> <b>group</b> in 4 days and 2 nd a day in 15 min, then the three groups were compared to each other. The questionnaire was Synder Life Expectancy Scale. Results were analyzed statistically by SPSS 16. Results: Results after the test, showed life expectancy in prayer) were (34 / 2 ± 35 / 37) and <b>mentioned</b> <b>group</b> (15 / 2 ± 3 / 3). Statistical analysis showed a significant difference between three groups, the greatest life expectancy was found in the <b>mentioning</b> <b>group</b> (P= 0 / 001). Tukey test's showed the difference between praying with the control group was (P= 0 / 039) and the controls (P= 0 / 00) showed. Conclusion: It seems that the spiritual experience along with other therapies would be effective and according to the guidelines it might be defined in the treatment of religious and spiritual care. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the influence of cultural diversity in childcare centres’ staff on caregiving practices regarding group processes, through caregivers’ beliefs. Participants were 57 caregivers from different cultural communities in the Netherlands (Dutch, Caribbean-Dutch, and Mediterranean-Dutch) working with two- to four-year-olds in day-care centres. Group centred beliefs were assessed with semi-structured interviews, caregivers’ practices and child behaviours were assessed during a 15 -minute observation of a staged activity, using rating scales. Caregivers <b>mentioning</b> <b>group</b> centred beliefs most during the interviews, showed more actual stimulation of group processes during the observed activity. Furthermore, a full mediation model showed that the groups of children cared for by these caregivers showed {{a higher degree of}} collaborative play, leading to a higher degree of cognitive complexity in their activity. The Mediterranean-Dutch caregivers <b>mentioned</b> <b>group</b> centred beliefs most and stimulated group processes most, no differences between the Dutch and Caribbean-Dutch caregivers were found regarding group processes.

50|$|Cognitive {{scholars}} {{claim that}} the human mind has a modular structure against one central processor. In this outlook, an individual internally evaluates and responds to environmental triggers through five inter-related modulus.

Another species group comprising C. thespidioides (Desert Sneezeweed), Centipeda cunninghamii (Old man weed, or Common sneeze-weed), C. crateriformis is well-sup- ported but then include the morphologically aberrant C. aotearoana, all sharing the character of having capitula that mature more slowly relative the subtending shoot.

5000|$|Verbs in Proto-Germanic {{were divided}} into two main groups, called [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "weak", {{according}} to the way the past tense is formed.
