50|$|A Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) is {{responsible}} for managing multipoint conferences and is composed of two logical entities {{referred to as the}} Multipoint Controller (MC) and the <b>Multipoint</b> <b>Processor</b> (MP). In more practical terms, an MCU is a conference bridge not unlike the conference bridges used in the PSTN today. The most significant difference, however, is that H.323 MCUs might be capable of mixing or switching video, in addition to the normal audio mixing done by a traditional conference bridge. Some MCUs also provide multipoint data collaboration capabilities. What this means to the end user is that, by placing a video call into an H.323 MCU, the user might be able to see all of the other participants in the conference, not only hear their voices.|$|E

50|$|A {{multipoint}} {{control unit}} (MCU) is a device {{commonly used to}} bridge videoconferencing connections. The multipoint control unit is an endpoint on the LAN that provides the capability for three or more terminals and gateways {{to participate in a}} multipoint conference. The MCU consists of a mandatory multipoint controller (MC) and optional <b>multipoint</b> <b>processors</b> (MPs).|$|R

In this paper, we consider the limita-tions of existing SIP conferencing methods and propose a dis-tributed architecture using Controllers (SIP Proxy Servers) and Conference Servers which facilitates the control and media handling of a VoIP conference. The Conference Servers are designed on the basis of H. 323 ’s <b>Multipoint</b> <b>Processors</b> and handle the audio part of the conference. We provide conferenc-ing messages on SIP that bring these Controllers and Confer-ence Servers together along with the Clients for scalable con-ference on the Internet. The schematic of the Proxy Server and Conference Server is presented to aid in implementation. We also explain the mechanism we use {{to improve the quality of}} mixed output speech by selecting the streams at the Clients. 1...|$|R
40|$|In a conference, {{considering}} the packets only f i o m {{a set of}} selected clients can reduce the degradation {{of the quality of}} speech because mixing packets from all clients can lead to lack of clarity in the speech of any participants. The automatic selection should be smooth arid should not cause frequent interruptions. A method of selecting the clients f o r mixing is suggested here based on a new quantifier of the voice activity called Loudness Number (LN). The dependence of the Loudness Number on the amplitude of the packet at present and the past activity is clearly brought out. The structure of the packet used has been explained. A method to avoid echo and enhance the quality of the conference is presented. The contributions of the paper are expected to aid in the implementation of H. 323 recommendations fo r the <b>Multipoint</b> <b>Processors</b> (MP).

40|$|Abstract 1 : Real-Time {{services}} are traditionally supported on circuit switched network. However, {{there is a}} need to port these services on packet switched network. Architecture for audio conferencing application over the Internet in the light of ITU-T H. 323 recommendations is considered. In a conference, considering packets only from a set of selected clients can reduce speech quality degradation because mixing packets from all clients can lead to lack of speech clarity. A distributed algorithm and architecture for selecting clients for mixing is suggested here based on a new quantifier of the voice activity called “Loudness Number ” (LN). The proposed system distributes the computation load and reduces the load on client terminals. The highlights of this architecture are scalability, bandwidth saving and speech quality enhancement. Client selection for playing out tries to mimic a physical conference where the most vocal participants attract more attention. The contributions of the paper are expected to aid H. 323 recommendations implementations for <b>Multipoint</b> <b>Processors</b> (MP). A working prototype based on the proposed architecture is already functional...|$|R
