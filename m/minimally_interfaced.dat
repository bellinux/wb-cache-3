40|$|Abstract: Rich, {{structured}} annotations {{of video}} recordings enable interesting uses, but existing techniques for manual, and even semi-automated, tagging {{can be too}} time-consuming. We present in this paper the ContextCam, a prototype of a consumer video camera that provides point of capture annotation of time, location, person presence and event information associated to recorded video. Both low- and high-level metadata are discovered via a variety of sensing and active tagging techniques, {{as well as through}} the application of machine learning techniques that use past annotations to suggest metadata for the current recordings. Furthermore, the ContextCam provides users with a <b>minimally</b> intrusive <b>interface</b> for correcting predicted high-level metadata during video recording. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} programming, the IUnknown (custom) interface is {{the fundamental}} interface in the Component Object Model (COM). The published COM specification mandates that COM objects must <b>minimally</b> implement this <b>interface.</b> Furthermore, every other COM interface must be derived from IUnknown. IUnknown exposes two essential features of all COM objects: object lifetime management through reference counting, and access to various predefined interfaces.|$|R
5000|$|Dove {{has been}} working with {{interactive}} narrative since 1990. Her work blends cinematic tropes typical of studio-age film noir with contemporary narrative trends in science fiction, cybernetics, and new media, often offering a feminist take on popular genres. Dove refers to her work as [...] "cyber-theatre" [...] because it relies on virtual performers (avatars) rather than human actors and because she gives her audience partial control over the performance through the use of interactive technologies. In these hybrids of film, installation art, and experimental theater, the participants interact with an unfolding narrative movie, often using <b>minimally</b> invasive <b>interface</b> technologies such as speech recognition and computer vision to control or 'perform' their on-screen avatars.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{evaluation}} of a hybrid gesture interface framework that combines on-line adaptive gesture recognition with a command predictor. Machine learning techniques enable on-line adaptation to differences in users' input patterns when making gestures, and exploit regularities in command sequences to improve recognition performance. A prototype using 2 D single-stroke gestures was implemented with a <b>minimally</b> intrusive user <b>interface</b> for on-line re-training. Results of a controlled user experiment show that the hybrid adaptive system significantly improved overall gesture recognition performance, and reduced users' need to practice making the gestures before achieving good results...|$|R
40|$|Current {{technologies}} for cell stimulation {{suffer from a}} variety of drawbacks. Indeed, precise, localized, and <b>minimally</b> disruptive machine-to-cell <b>interfacing</b> is difficult to achieve. Here we present the organic electronic ion pump (OEIP), a polymer-based delivery system exhibiting high spatial, temporal, and dosage precision. Based on electrophoretic transport of positively charged species, the OEIP can deliver - with high precision - an array of biologically relevant substances without fluid flow, thus eliminating convective disturbance of the target system's environment. We discuss our results to date, including oscillatory delivery profiles and stimulation of neuronal cells in vitro, as well as our ongoing work...|$|R
40|$|Waterjet cutting {{technology}} {{is considered a}} promising technology {{to be used for}} minimally invasive removal of interface tissue surrounding aseptically loose hip prostheses. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the feasibility of waterjet cutting of interface tissue membrane. Waterjets with 0. 2 mm and 0. 6 mm diameter, a stand-off distance of 5 mm, and a traverse speed of 0. 5 mm/s were used to cut interface tissue samples in half. The water flow through the nozzle was controlled by means of a valve. By changing the flow, the resulting waterjet pressure was regulated. Tissue sample thickness and the required waterjet pressures were measured. Mean thickness of the samples tested within the 0. 2 mm nozzle group was 2. 3 mm (SD 0. 7 mm) and within the 0. 6 mm nozzle group 2. 6 mm (SD 0. 9 mm). The required waterjet pressure to cut samples was between 10 and 12 MPa for the 0. 2 mm nozzle and between 5 and 10 MPa for the 0. 6 mm nozzle. Cutting bone or bone cement requires about 3 times higher waterjet pressure (30 - 50 MPa, depending on used nozzle diameter) and therefore we consider waterjet cutting as a safe technique to be used for <b>minimally</b> invasive <b>interface</b> tissue remova...|$|R
40|$|Collaboration is of {{the essence}} of smart grids. Smart grids enable {{participants}} to collaborate to align energy supply and demand. The architecturally significant interfaces of smart grids are those that are at boundaries between the collaborating entities. These <b>interfaces</b> <b>minimally</b> constrain the parties on either side while providing effective conduits for actionable information between the entities. Each collaborator will maintain its own privacy while interacting through these interfaces. We apply these criteria to the roadmap for standardization. While the two entities that interact at an architecturally significant interface can generally be called supplier and consumer, these roles are not fixed. The consumer may be a supplier to entities on its side of the interface. A consumer can also be a supplier of energy. The architecturally significant interfaces of the grid must honor the principles of symmetry and minimal knowledge, and interact with each other through carefully defined general services. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{basically}} electrical {{nature of}} the brain's information processing opens a splendid way to learn about its details by using extracellular, microwire recordings to eavesdrop on the activity and information exchange among its neuronal constituents. This method has the advantage over glass micropipettes of bringing quite a sturdy probe into the vicinity of {{a more or less}} randomly selected neuron. With this method an immense volume of knowledge was acquired with single - and multiple-electrode recordings from the living brain. This chapter discusses the examples to illustrate that the technology of electrophysiological microrecordings - and for that matter stimulation as well-has come a long way toward multisite and <b>minimally</b> traumatic brain <b>interfacing</b> devices. However, the future of these technologies is even more exciting than the past, since the combination of electrical with optical modalities puts new procedures at the hands of neuroscientists and perhaps even clinical practitioners...|$|R
40|$|Miniature, {{self-contained}} biodevices {{powered by}} biofuel cells may enable {{a new generation}} of implantable, wireless, <b>minimally</b> invasive neural <b>interfaces</b> for neurophysiological in vivo studies and for clinical applications. Here we report on the fabrication of a direct electron transfer based glucose/oxygen enzymatic fuel cell (EFC) from genuinely three-dimensional (3 D) nanostructured microscale gold electrodes, modified with suitable biocatalysts. We show that the process underlying the simple fabrication method of 3 D nanostructured electrodes is based on an electrochemically driven transformation of physically deposited gold nanoparticles. We experimentally demonstrate that mediator-, cofactor-, and membrane-less EFCs do operate in cerebrospinal fluid and in the brain of a rat, producing amounts of electrical power sufficient to drive a self-contained biodevice, viz. 7 μW cm− 2 in vitro and 2 μW cm− 2 in vivo at an operating voltage of 0. 4 V. Last but not least, we also demonstrate an inductive coupling between 3 D nanobioelectrodes and living neurons...|$|R
40|$|Consumed Endurance (CE) [8] is a metric {{that captures}} {{the degree of}} arm fatigue during mid-air interactions. Research has shown that CE can assist with the design of new and <b>minimally</b> {{fatiguing}} gestural <b>interfaces.</b> We introduce the Consumed Endurance Workbench, an open source application that calculates CE in real time using an off-the-shelf skeleton tracking system. The CE Workbench tracks a person’s arm as it is moved in mid-air, determining the forces involved and calculating CE over {{the length of the}} interaction. Our demonstration focuses on how to use the CE Workbench to evaluate alternative mid-air gesture designs, how to integrate the CE Workbench with existing applications, and how to prepare the CE data for statistical analysis. We also demonstrate a mid-air text-entry layout, SEATO, which we created taking CE as the main design factor.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a fiber-optic architecture for neural recording without contrast agents, and study its properties theoretically. Our sensor design {{is inspired by}} electrooptic modulators, which modulate the refractive index of a waveguide by applying an electric field across an electrooptic core material, and allows recording of the activities of individual neurons located at points along a 10 cm length of optical fiber with 20 um axial resolution, sensitivity down to 100 uV and a dynamic range of up to 1 V using commercially available optical reflectometers as readout devices. A key concept of the design {{is the ability to}} create an "intensified" electric field inside an optical waveguide by applying the extracellular voltage from a neural spike over a nanoscopic distance. Implementing this concept requires the use of ultrathin high-dielectric capacitor layers. If suitable materials can be found [...] possessing favorable properties with respect to toxicity, ohmic junctions, and surface capacitance [...] then such sensing fibers could, in principle, be scaled down to few-micron cross-sections for <b>minimally</b> invasive neural <b>interfacing.</b> Custom-designed multi-material optical fibers, probed using a reflectometric readout, may therefore provide a powerful platform for neural sensing...|$|R
40|$|For the {{development}} of <b>minimally</b> invasive brain-computer <b>interfaces</b> (BCIs), {{it is important to}} accurately localize the area of implantation. Using fMRI, we investigated which brain areas are involved in motor imagery. Twelve healthy subjects performed a motor execution and imagery task during separate fMRI and EEG measurements. fMRI results showed that during imagery, premotor and parietal areas were most robustly activated in individual subjects, but surprisingly, no activation was found in the primary motor cortex. EEG results showed that spectral power decreases in contralateral sensorimotor rhythms (8 - 24 Hz) during both movement and imagery. To further verify the involvement of the motor imagery areas found with fMRI, one epilepsy patient performed the same task during both fMRI and ECoG recordings. Significant ECoG low (8 - 24 Hz) and high (65 - 95 Hz) frequency power changes were observed selectively on premotor cortex and these co-localized with fMRI. During a subsequent BCI task, excellent performance (91 %) was obtained based on ECoG power changes from the localized premotor area. These results indicate that other areas than the primary motor area may be more reliably activated during motor imagery. Specifically, the premotor cortex may be a better area to implant an invasive BCI...|$|R
40|$|Clinically {{viable and}} <b>minimally</b> {{invasive}} neural <b>interfaces</b> stand to revolutionize disease care {{for patients with}} neurological conditions. For example, recent research in Brain-Machine Interfaces has shown success in using electronic signals from the motor cortex of the brain to control artificial limbs, providing hope for patients with spinal cord injuries. Currently, neural interfaces are large, wired and require open-skull operation. Future, less invasive interfaces with increased numbers of electrodes, signal processing and wireless capability will enable prosthetics, disease control and completely new user-computer interfaces. The {{first part of this}} thesis presents a signal-acquisition front end for neural recording that uses a digitally intensive architecture to reduce system area and enable operation from a 0. 5 V supply. The entire front-end occupies only 0. 013 mm 2 while including "per-pixel" digitization, and enables simultaneous recording of LFP and action potentials for the first time. The second part presents the development of a minimally invasive yet scalable wireless platform for electrocorticography (ECoG), an electrophysiological technique where electrical potentials are recorded {{from the surface of the}} cerebral cortex, greatly reducing cortical scarring and improving implant longevity. A high-density flexible MEMS electrode array is tightly integrated with active circuits and a power-receiving antenna to realize a fully implantable system in a very small footprint. Building on the previously developed digitally intensive architecture, an order of magnitude in circuit area reduction is realized with 3 x improvement in power efficiency over state-of-the-art enabling a scalable platform for 64 -channel recording and beyond...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the design and}} theoretical analysis of a fiber-optic architecture for neural recording without contrast agents, which transduces neural electrical signals into a multiplexed optical readout. Our sensor design is inspired by electro-optic modulators, which modulate the refractive index of a waveguide by applying a voltage across an electro-optic core material. We estimate that this design would allow recording of the activities of individual neurons located at points along a 10 -cm length of optical fiber with 40 -μm axial resolution and sensitivity down to 100 [*][*]μV using commercially available optical reflectometers as readout devices. Neural recording sites detect a potential difference against a reference and apply this potential to a capacitor. The waveguide serves {{as one of the}} plates of the capacitor, so charge accumulation across the capacitor results in an optical effect. A key concept of the design is that the sensitivity can be improved by increasing the capacitance. To maximize the capacitance, we utilize a microscopic layer of material with high relative permittivity. If suitable materials can be found—possessing high capacitance per unit area as well as favorable properties with respect to toxicity, optical attenuation, ohmic junctions, and surface capacitance—then such sensing fibers could, in principle, be scaled down to few-micron cross-sections for <b>minimally</b> invasive neural <b>interfacing.</b> We study these material requirements and propose potential material choices. Custom-designed multimaterial optical fibers, probed using a reflectometric readout, may, therefore, provide a powerful platform for neural sensing. Hertz FoundationNational Science Foundation (U.
