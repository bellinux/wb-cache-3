They believe that all must put faith in the propitiatory work of Christ to gain everlasting life. According to United Pentecostal theology, this saving faith {{is more than just}} <b>mental</b> <b>assent</b> or intellectual acceptance, or even verbal profession, but must include trust, appropriation, application, action, and obedience. They contend that water baptism is one of the works of faith and obedience necessary for Christ's sacrificial atonement to be efficacious.|$|E
5000|$|The House of Lords (The Lord Chancellor, Lord Cairns, Lord Hatherley, Lord Selborne, Lord Blackburn, and Lord Gordon) {{held that}} a {{contract}} had arisen by conduct and Brogden had been in clear breach, so he must be liable. The word [...] "approved" [...] on the document with Brogden's name was binding on all the partners, since Brogden was the chief partner, even though the standard signature of “B. & Sons” was not used. A mere <b>mental</b> <b>assent</b> to the agreement's terms {{would not have been}} enough, but having acted on the terms made it so. Lord Blackburn also held that the onus of showing that both parties had acted on the terms of an agreement which had not been, in due form, executed by either, lies upon person alleging such facts.

40|$|The {{standard}} view in epistemology is that propositional knowledge entails belief. Positive {{arguments are}} seldom given for this entailment thesis, however; instead, its truth is typically assumed. Against the entailment thesis, Myers-Schulz and Schwitzgebel (forthcoming) report that a non trivial {{percentage of people}} think that there can be propositional knowledge without belief. In this paper, we add further fuel to the fire, presenting the results of four new studies. Based on our results, we argue that the entailment thesis does not deserve the default status that it is typically granted. We conclude by considering the alternative account of knowledge that Myers-Schulz and Schwitzgebel propose to explain their results, arguing that it does not explain ours. In its place we offer a different explanation of both sets of findings—the conviction account, according to which belief, but not knowledge, requires <b>mental</b> <b>assent.</b> Few claims in philosophy are as widely held as that propositional knowledge entails belief. Certainly, this entailment thesis is the standard view in contemporary epistemology. 2 But why? Although some positive arguments for the thesis {{can be found in the}} literature, it is not often argued for; instead, it is generally assumed to be true until proven false. In other words, many epistemologists have treated the entailment thesis as having a default status. We argu...|$|E
