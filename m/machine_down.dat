25|$|After a {{transfer}} to 18 Squadron in France, on 28 November 1915 Cunningham and his observer used a Vickers Gunbus {{to drive down}} an LVG reconnaissance <b>machine</b> <b>down</b> over La Bassée. On 29 December 1915, Cunningham had switched to a single-seat Bristol Scout to drive down an Aviatik recon plane over Provin. On 5 February 1916, he used an Airco DH.2 to force an Albatros recon machine to land at Carvin.|$|E
500|$|The ZX81's {{designers}} {{adopted an}} improved approach, involving {{the use of}} two modes called SLOW and FAST respectively. In SLOW mode, also called [...] "compute and display" [...] mode, the ZX81 concentrates on driving the display. It runs the current program for only {{about a quarter of}} the time – in effect slowing the <b>machine</b> <b>down</b> fourfold, although in practice the speed difference between FAST and SLOW modes depends on what computation is being done. In FAST mode, processing occurs continuously, but the display is abandoned to its own devices – equivalent to the ZX80's standard operating mode.|$|E
500|$|Later, two {{government}} physicists {{show up at}} Chris' mansion {{to announce}} that Sonic's' world and Earth were once a single world split in two by a cataclysmic event, but are rejoining, which will stop time irreversibly, {{and the only way}} to stop it is to send the anthropomorphic people back home. Tails and Chuck begin to build a gate to teleport Sonic and company back to their own world with Chaos Control, but Chris does not want them to leave. When it is finished and all their friends but Sonic have left, Chris suddenly shuts the <b>machine</b> <b>down</b> and whisks Sonic into the woods to hide out of fear his parents will return to never being home once Sonic is gone. Sonic is understanding, yet teaches Chris that as a fellow person neither can force the other to feel a certain way and that their friendship is free will. [...] Chris tearfully acknowledges that he bound Sonic's freedom today and stopped his friend from going back home and remorsefully asks for forgiveness while Sonic tells him he'll be able to be strong even without him being there. [...] Chris' parents find him and promise to spend more time with him. Chris having learned his lesson and grown as a person goes for one final run with Sonic before they mutually part ways and Sonic returns to his own planet, stopping the merging of the worlds. However, Chris vows that one day, he will see Sonic again.|$|E

500|$|Throughout February and March 1917, No.1 Squadron was [...] "continually in action" [...] {{along the}} Somme {{sector of the}} Western Front. During April, the {{squadron}} maintained a high operational tempo with {{the launch of the}} Arras offensive. In an air battle on 29 April, Minifie was credited with his first two aerial victories, shooting down an Albatros D.III in a solo effort, before sharing in the destruction of a second with fellow Australian, Flight Sub-Lieutenant Robert A. Little of No8 (Naval) Squadron. Over the next two months, Minifie participated in the [...] "highly effective" [...] ground-strafing missions on Bullecourt and during the Battle of Messines, while simultaneously adding to his tally of aircraft brought down; he became an ace during this period. At 19 years of age, Minifie was the youngest Australian ace of the First World War. He was promoted to acting flight lieutenant in July, taking part in the Passchendaele offensive later that month. On 8 August, Minifie destroyed a German scout plane, forcing the <b>machine</b> <b>down</b> in flames and thus scoring his seventh victory. Ten days later, he executed a raid on two German aerodromes. Flying at a height of , he fired approximated 450 rounds of ammunition into the hangars. Cited for his efforts in bringing down several German aircraft and his assaults on ground targets between April and September, Minifie was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The notice for the decoration was promulgated in a supplement to the London Gazette on 2 November 1917.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} {{specific}} upgrades and improvements {{made to the}} machines produced after the 82-30, with after-market solid-state/microprocessor-operated controllers available for the 82-30 itself. The 82-70 is the general standard in most AMF-equipped modern bowling centers today. It features a microprocessor-operated chassis that is upgraded to short cycle the machine for strikes, gutter balls, or 7–10 pick-offs. It features solid state motors. The 82-90 and the 82-90XLI are further upgrades, basically using the 82-70's mechanics, which replaced the older, completely electro-mechanical controls with machine status indicator lights, much more sophisticated [...] "pin storage" [...] design, single control centers that handle two machines, {{and perhaps the most}} important upgrade is the self shutdown control, which shuts the <b>machine</b> <b>down</b> to prevent damage from continuing to operate with a fault. The 82-90 models feature a deck that is thinner than the 82-70.|$|E
