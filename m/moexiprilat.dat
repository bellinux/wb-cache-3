In BrdU proliferation assays, oestrone (10 − 7 – 10 − 9 [*]M) stimulated cardiac fibroblast growth in a concentration-dependent fashion (maximum at 10 − 7 [*]M, 4. 0 fold± 0. 14 in female and 3. 1 fold± 0. 06 in male cells, n= 9, P< 0. 05), while E 2 (10 − 7 – 10 − 9 [*]M) had no effect. <b>Moexiprilat</b> (10 − 7 [*]M) completely inhibited oestrone-induced cardiac fibroblast growth. Angiotensin II (10 − 7 [*]M) induced cardiac fibroblast growth (female 4. 1 fold± 0. 1 /male 3. 9 fold± 0. 2; n= 9, P< 0. 05). Angiotensin II induced oestrogen receptor (maximum 21. 8 fold at 60 [*]min) and egr- 1 (maximum 47. 5 fold at 60 [*]min) expression in a time-dependent fashion. In immunoblot experiments, oestrogen activated oestrogen receptor (ES: 12. 8 fold± 2. 0; E 2 : 14. 7 fold± 4. 9; n= 3, P< 0. 05) and egr- 1 (ES: 5. 1 fold,± 0. 24; E 2 : 3. 8 fold,± 0. 25; n= 3, P< 0. 05) expression. The induction of oestrogen receptor and egr- 1 protein expression was time-dependent and inhibited by <b>moexiprilat.</b> Our results show that oestrone and 17 β-oestradiol reveal {{a significant difference in}} their potential to activate cardiac fibroblast growth in female and male cells and that oestrone-stimulated growth is inhibited by <b>moexiprilat.</b> The inhibition of oestrone-stimulated cardiac fibroblast growth by <b>moexiprilat</b> may contribute to the beneficial effects seen in postmenopausal women with hypertensive heart disease treated with ACE inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{progression}} of {{left ventricular hypertrophy}} and cardiac fibrosis in hypertensive heart disease is influenced by sex and age. Although angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition {{has been shown to}} prevent {{progression of}} the disease in postmenopausal women, the interaction of angiotensin II and estrogen in this process before and after the menopause is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor <b>moexiprilat</b> on serum, estrogen and angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibroblast growth. METHODS: Neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts were incubated with 1 and 10 % fetal calf serum, 10 (- 7) mol/l angiotensin II, 10 (- 9) mol/l estrone, 10 (- 9) mol/l 17 beta-estradiol and 10 (- 8) mol/l <b>moexiprilat.</b> Proliferation was measured in terms of incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine. Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies directed against the growth-related immediate early genes c-fos and Sp- 1. All experiments were performed at least three times. RESULTS: Fetal calf serum stimulated cardiac fibroblast proliferation (1 % fetal calf serum 2. 0 +/- 0. 028 -fold; 10 % fetal calf serum 2. 7 +/- 0. 028 -fold). Angiotensin II and estrone stimulated proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts grown in the absence of fetal calf serum (angiotensin II 4. 2 +/- 0. 075 -fold; estrone 2. 9 +/- 0. 034 -fold) and further increased proliferation in the presence of 1 % fetal calf serum (angiotensin 11 4. 3 +/- 0. 072 -fold); estrone 3. 8 +/- 0. 045 -fold) and 10 % fetal calf serum (angiotensin II 4. 8 +/- 0. 112 -fold; estrone 4. 1 +/- 0. 047 -fold). Coincubation with <b>moexiprilat</b> specifically inhibited proliferation induced by angiotensin II and estrone but not by serum, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade inhibited angiotensin II-induced but not estrone-induced cell growth. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of c-fos and Sp- 1 was induced in a time-dependent fashion by angiotensin II (to maxima of 5. 0 -fold for c-fos and 3. 0 -fold for Sp- 1) and estrone (15. 2 -fold for c-fos and 6. 2 -fold for Sp- 1). This effect was completely inhibited by <b>moexiprilat.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition modulates cardiac fibroblast growth induced by angiotensin II and estrone. This mechanism might contribute to the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in postmenopausal patients with hypertensive heart disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacodynamic}} {{profile of}} the new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor moexipril and its active diacid, <b>moexiprilat,</b> was studied in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, <b>moexiprilat</b> exhibited a higher inhibitory potency than enalaprilat against both plasma ACE and purified ACE from rabbit lung. Upon oral administration of moexipril (10 mg/kg/day) to spontaneously hypertensive rats, plasma angiotensin II concentration decreased to undetectable levels, plasma ACE activity was inhibited by 98 % and plasma angiotensin I concentration increased 8. 6 -fold 1 h after dosing. At 24 h, plasma angiotensin I and angiotensin II concentrations had returned to pretreatment levels, whereas plasma ACE activity was still inhibited by 56 %. Four-week oral administration of moexipril (0. 1 - 30 mg/kg/day) to spontaneously hypertensive rats lowered blood pressure and differentially inhibited ACE activity in plasma, lung, aorta, heart and kidney in a dose-dependent fashion. Equidose treatment (10 mg/kg/day) with moexipril and enalapril over 4 weeks led to comparable decreases in blood pressure, inhibition of plasma ACE and reduction of plasma angiotensinogen and to a similar attenuation of the pressor responses to angiotensin I and potentiation of the depressor responses to bradykinin. In contrast, ACE inhibition in aorta, heart and lung was significantly greater with moexipril than with enalapril, whereas in the kidney both drugs inhibited ACE activity to a similar extent. In summary, moexipril is an orally active ACE inhibitor that is comparable to enalapril in potency and duration of antihypertensive activity. The {{results of the present}} study demonstrate that 1) the antihypertensive potency of a given ACE inhibitor cannot be predicted from its in vitro characteristics and 2) the degree of blood pressure reduction does not correlate with tissue ACE inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors exert their {{cardiovascular}} effects {{not only}} by preventing the formation of angiotensin II (AII), but also by promoting the accumulation of bradykinin in or at the vessel wall. In addition, certain ACE inhibitors {{have been shown to}} augment the vasodilator response to bradykinin, presumably by an interaction {{at the level of the}} B 2 receptor. We have investigated whether this is a specific effect of the ACE inhibitor class of compounds in isolated endothelium-denuded segments of the rabbit jugular vein where bradykinin elicits a constrictor response which is exclusively mediated by activation of the B 2 receptor. <b>Moexiprilat</b> and ramiprilat (⩽ 3 [*]nM) enhanced the constrictor response to bradykinin three to four fold. Captopril and enalaprilat were less active by approximately one and quinaprilat by two orders of magnitude. <b>Moexiprilat</b> and ramiprilat, on the other hand, had no effect on the constrictor response to AII or the dilator response to acetylcholine. The bradykinin-potentiating effect of the ACE inhibitors was not mimicked by inhibitors of amino-, carboxy-, metallo- or serine peptidases or the synthetic ACE substrate, hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine, at a concentration which almost abolished the residual ACE activity in the vessel wall. In contrast, angiotensin-(1 – 7) (10 [*]μM), an angiotensin I metabolite, significantly enhanced the constrictor response to bradykinin. Ramiprilat did not alter the binding of [3 H]-bradykinin to a membrane fraction prepared from endothelium-denuded rabbit jugular veins or to cultured fibroblasts, and there was no ACE inhibitor-sensitive, bradykinin-induced cleavage of the B 2 receptor in cultured endothelial cells. These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitors selectively potentiate the B 2 receptor-mediated vascular effects of bradykinin. Their relative efficacy appears to be independent of their ACE-inhibiting properties and might be related to differences in molecule structure. Moreover, the potentiation of the biological activity of bradykinin by this class of compounds does not seem to be mediated by a shift in affinity of the B 2 receptor or a prevention of its desensitization, but may involve an increase in the intrinsic activity of unoccupied B 2 receptor molecules...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) {{inhibition}} and angiotensin type[*] 1 (AT 1) receptor blockade on insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) induced proliferation and immediate-early-gene expression of neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts were investigated. Moreover {{the role of}} the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) in this process was evaluated. IGF-I (10 − 9 – 10 − 7 [*]M) stimulated neonatal rat cardiac fibroblast growth in a dose-dependent fashion (maximum: 3. 5 ± 0. 1 fold, 10 − 7 [*]M), as determined by 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. ACE inhibition or AT 1 receptor blockade attenuated the IGF-I (10 − 7 [*]M) induced neonatal rat cardiac fibroblast growth in a concentration-dependent fashion (moexiprilat: 50 ± 2 %, enalaprilat: 31 ± 2 %, CV 11974; 58 ± 1 %, all: 10 − 7 [*]M). IGF-I stimulated cellular growth was accompanied by an upregulation of the immediate early genes c-Fos (2. 4 ± 0. 3 fold), Egr- 1 (4. 7 ± 1. 1 fold) and Sp 1 (6. 2 ± 0. 7 fold). IGF-I induced expression was completely inhibited by ACE inhibition or AT 1 receptor blockade. Stimulation with IGF-I or Ang II (10 − 7 [*]M) increased IGF-IR expression 5. 7 ± 0. 5 fold and 3. 6 ± 0. 5 fold respectively. The IGF-I induced overexpression of the IGF-IR was reduced by ACE inhibition with <b>moexiprilat</b> (10 − 7 [*]M) by 79 ± 7 % and by AT 1 receptor blockade with CV 11974 (10 − 7 [*]M) by 79 ± 5 %. These data demonstrate that the mitogenic action of IGF-I in neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts is in part mediated by activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with subsequent upregulation of IGF-IR expression. This observation has important implications for the treatment of cardiac diseases with ACE inhibitors alone and their combination with IGF-I or growth hormone...|$|E
