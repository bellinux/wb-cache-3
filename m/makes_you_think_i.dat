He asked them half-a-dozen times over whether the United States had enough armed ships for any shape or sort of war with any one. He asked 'em, if they thought she had those ships, to give him those ships, and they looked on the ground, as if they {{expected}} to find 'em there. He put it to 'em whether, setting ships aside, their country--I reckon he gave 'em good reasons--whether the United States was ready or able to face a new big war; she having but so few years back wound up one against England, and being all holds full of her own troubles. As I said, the strong way he laid it all before 'em blasted 'em, and when he'd done it was like a still in the woods after a storm.

6000|$|These words made Friday look so very pensive that I {{thought he}} would have fallen at my feet. It was some time before he could speak a word, which made me ask him, {{what was the matter}} with him? He replied in a very soft and moving tone, What has poor Friday done? why are you angry mad with poor servant? What me done, O what me done? [...] "Friday," [...] said I, [...] "you never yet have {{offended}} me, what <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am angry with you, when I am not angry at all."

[...] "Why from a mountain you beheld the place where you was born, and is it not to satisfy your desires that I am willing to give you leave to return thither?" [...] Yes, yes, said Friday, me wish to be there sure enough, but then me with master there too: no wish Friday there, no master there. In short, he could not endure the thoughts of going there without me. [...] "I go there! Friday," [...] said I, [...] "what shall I do there?" [...] He answered very quickly, O master you do great deal much good, you teach all de wild mans to be good tame mans: you learn dem to be sober, life good live, to know God, and pray God. [...] "Alas! poor Friday," [...] said I, [...] "what can I do against their priests of Benamuckee, or indeed what good can I make your nation sensible of, when I myself am but a poor ignorant man?" [...] No, no, master, said he, you be no ignorant, you teachee me good, you teachee dem good. [...] "You shall go without me, Friday," [...] said I, [...] "for I don't care to accompany you thither; I would rather live in this solitude than venture among such inhuman savages. Go your way since you desire it, and leave me alone by myself as I was before I saved your life." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{decomposition}} rule then designates {{a particular}} reassembly rule, {{or set of}} reassembly rules, to follow when reconstructing the sentence. The reassembly rule then takes the fragments of the input that the decomposition rule had created, rearranges them, and adds in programmed words to create a response. Using Weizenbaum’s example previously stated, such a reassembly rule would take the fragments and apply them to the phrase “What <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am (4)” which would result in “What <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am very helpful”. This example is rather simple, since depending upon the disassembly rule, the output could be significantly more complex and use more of the input from the user. However, from this reassembly, ELIZA then sends the constructed sentence to the user {{in the form of}} text on the screen.|$|E

One of the reasons ARCO is successful is that I encourage my {{people to look at}} all issues from every possible angle. That's one of the many reasons contemporary art is beneficial to society. It inspires you to think outside the box and use your imagination. If you examine a problem closely and think about all the possible solutions, you'll come up with the best possible answer. That's part of what made ARCO a success." ...|$|E

In the Final Crisis: Rogues Revenge series, however, Weather Wizard {{and the rest of the}} Rogues reject Libras offer, wanting to stay out of the game (Captain Cold even berates Mirror Master for working with scum like Dr. Light). Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia {{escaping}} and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used. In retaliation, Libra kidnaps Josh and tries to get Mardon to join the Society, threatening to kill the boy if he does not. To which Mardon responds [...] "If I killed my brother, Libra, if I electrocuted the only person who ever cared about me, what <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> care anything about that child?" [...] Libra then taunts Mardon to prove him wrong. Mardon is hesitant to make a move when Inertia kills the boy himself, and Mardon joins his fellow Rogues in defeating and killing Inertia.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} and best known examples of a computer program designed to converse naturally with humans is the ELIZA program developed by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT in 1966. The program emulated a Rogerian psychotherapist when responding to written statements and questions posed by a user. It appeared capable of understanding what was said to it and responding intelligently, but in truth it simply followed a pattern matching routine that relied on only understanding a few keywords in each sentence. Its responses were generated by recombining the unknown parts of the sentence around properly translated versions of the known words. For example, in the phrase [...] "It seems that you hate me" [...] ELIZA understands [...] "you" [...] and [...] "me" [...] which matches the general pattern [...] "you words me", allowing ELIZA to update the words [...] "you" [...] and [...] "me" [...] to [...] "I" [...] and [...] "you" [...] and replying [...] "What <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> hate you?". In this example ELIZA has no understanding of the word [...] "hate", {{but it is not}} required for a logical response {{in the context of this}} type of psychotherapy.|$|E

I don't want to be from an angry position. That's out there, and maybe they do that to shake <b>you</b> up and <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> want to be one step ahead. When you're talking about healing, you're in the right zone." [...] As such, his images of slavery and historical Southern life focus on positive values such as family, character, and church.|$|R

[...] "If that is the case, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we had better let it stand. I didn't try to <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was a lunatic, at all; on the contrary, I wanted to produce a {{favorable}} impression. But if, after all, I made a fool of myself, it was the intention of Providence. I should injure myself by protesting too much, for I should seem {{to set up a}} claim for wisdom which, in the sequel of our acquaintance, I could by no means justify. Set me down as a lunatic with intervals of sanity." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{vision of}} having a {{computer}} communicate with humans in natural language was entertained shortly after the computer was invented. Weizenbaum’s (1966) ELIZA program was the first conversation system that was rea-sonably successful, popular, and widely used. ELIZA simulated a Rogerian client-centered psychotherapist, as illustrated in the conversation below. Patient: You are like my father in some ways. ELIZA: How am I like your father? Patient: You are very aggressive but I think you don’t want me to notice that. ELIZA: What <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am aggressive? Patient: You always argue with me. ELIZA: Why do you think I argue with you? Like a typical Rogerian therapist, ELIZA {{tried to get the}} patient to do the talking by asking the patient questions about the patient’s verbal contributions to the exchange. Conversation partners are expected to answer questions, so a therapist’s question readily turns the spotlight onto the patient. ELIZA turned the patient’s assertions into a therapist’s questions by simple syntactic transforma...|$|E

5000|$|Aarti Party is a Food Network {{television}} {{program in the}} USA, starring Aarti Sequeira, the sixth season winner of the reality series The Next Food Network Star. The program focuses on sharing easy ways to enhance American favorite dishes with simple but unique Indian influences. It premiered on August 22, 2010. Sequeira pitched {{the idea for the}} series—similar to a 2008-2010 online cooking variety show she hosted called Aarti Paarti—during her time on The Next Food Network Star. Aarti Party was renewed for a 13-episode second season, which began on December 12, 2010. The third season began on Sunday, July 3, 2011, at 9am/8c according to her website. After three seasons, the show was cancelled but reruns are shown on the Cooking Channel. Aarti posted on her Facebook page, “Since everyone has been asking, and I don’t want to ignore <b>you</b> and <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> don’t read your comments, I guess I should let you know that my show was not picked up.
