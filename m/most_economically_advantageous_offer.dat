40|$|AbstractAround the world, clients procure {{construction}} contracts aiming at project completion within predefined cost, time and quality constraints. In parallel, {{it is critical}} {{in the public sector}} to achieve the contract award as objectively as possible. In most cases, the public clients’ award is based on the lower price only; in the contracts, penalties are foreseen for time deadlines violation and quality control bad results. In the European Union legislation, the <b>most</b> <b>economically</b> <b>advantageous</b> tender is also considered as an award criterion, encompassing in fact many sub-criteria. The pros and cons of both approaches have extensively been discussed in the literature. Therefore, the choice of a procurement method that will combine the merits of both approaches to the wider possible extent is of utmost importance. In this paper, a new award method based on the <b>most</b> <b>economically</b> <b>advantageous</b> tender is proposed. The sub-criteria considered are construction cost, completion time and warranty offered by each bidder. Their objective evaluation is carried out by implementing utility theory.

40|$|In {{the global}} {{construction}} context, {{the best value}} or <b>most</b> <b>economically</b> <b>advantageous</b> tender is becoming a widespread approach for contractor selection, {{as an alternative to}} other traditional awarding criteria such as the lowest price. In these multi-attribute tenders, the owner or auctioneer solicits proposals containing both a price bid and additional technical features. Once the proposals are received, each bidder’s price bid is given an economic score according to a scoring rule, generally called an economic scoring formula (ESF) and a technical score according to pre-specified criteria. Eventually, the contract is awarded to the bidder with the highest weighted overall score (economic + technical). However, economic scoring formula selection by auctioneers is invariably and paradoxically a highly intuitive process in practice, involving few theoretical or empirical considerations, despite having been considered traditionally and mistakenly as objective, due to its mathematical nature. This paper provides a taxonomic classification {{of a wide variety of}} ESFs and abnormally low bids criteria (ALBC) gathered in several countries with different tendering approaches.

40|$|When {{choosing}} {{and applying}} the award criteria {{in the context}} of public procurement procedures, contracting authorities exercise their discretionary powers with a view to selecting the <b>most</b> <b>economically</b> <b>advantageous</b> tender. The importance of the use that contracting authorities make of their margin of discretion {{is directly related to the}} result of any public procurement procedure: the level of satisfaction of the contracting authorities’ needs provided by the works/supply/service contract concluded with the winning tenderer. Despite the tendency for public procurement regulation to focus on procedural rules (‘how to buy’), rather than the actual outcome of the procurement activity itself (‘what to buy’), there are substantive requirements derived from legislative sources, as well as soft law and jurisprudence, that somehow structure the contracting authorities’ decision making freedom. Although there is no standard unit that allows for the measurement of contracting authorities’ margin of discretion and its variation, this thesis aims to identify factors which contribute either to increase or to reduce the said margin. In other words, it is proposed to highlight the elements which determine the expansion or the limitation of the referred discretionary powers.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{introduce}} a method of performance-based procurement, based on the <b>most</b> <b>economically</b> <b>advantageous</b> tender (MEAT), for low-disturbance bridge construction projects in urban environment. Design/methodology/approach – The {{first part of this}} paper reviews the key performance indicators (KPIs) of low-disturbance construction and the procurement procedure based on the MEAT principles. The second part reflects on two actual bridge projects (the Rotebro bridge in Sweden and the Arno river bridge in Italy) as observatory case studies to analyse how clients and contractors can implement the KPIs in MEAT. Findings – The research findings demonstrate the possible inclusion of the KPIs of low-disturbance construction into the MEAT criteria. The MEAT principles can then be used in combination with either a traditional or an integrated procurement strategy. Research limitations/implications – The implementation of MEAT to achieve low-disturbance construction projects is considerably new and still requires an empirical validation. A further elaboration of the procurement strategy within the EU regulatory framework is strongly recommended in order to assure the broader impacts of sustainable construction. Practical implications – The findings and recommendations support the practical development and the use of MEAT in construction projects in the EU.

40|$|As {{part of a}} wider {{concern with}} {{sustainability}} issues, throughout Europe there is increasing interest in alternative food supply chains. Local and organic food (LOF) is gradually gaining ground also among institutional customers. Public food purchases are constrained by the legal framework of the EU law on public procurement. The law encourages the use of <b>most</b> <b>economically</b> <b>advantageous</b> tender (MEAT), which enables the contracting authority {{to take into account}} criteria other than only the lowest price. One of the restrictions in increasing the use of LOF items in institutional kitchens is the tedious procurement process. Using a case study approach, this paper explores the tendering process and its development from price-based competitive bidding towards anticipatory dialogue and interaction between the suppliers and catering personnel. The implications for SMESs are discussed. It is concluded that when the purchasing know-how is used wisely public catering constitutes a protected space for the SME:s to develop. The most important steps in increasing LOF in public catering are taken at local level. It requires local policy makers’ strategic decisions and strong commitment to long-term development work. Access to LOF items vary, and the goals in increasing the use of LOF need to be defined so as to address the case-specific circumstances and by paying due attention to the experts by experience, i. e. the actors of the catering sector and their customers.

At {{the heart of the}} procurement process is the need to define the requirements of the system – is it to procure a test vehicle for assessing new technologies, provide a solution to a specific application or provide a general solution to a broad range of applications? Is the expectation to have high availability, minimise the acquisition or running cost, maximise the capabilities, minimise the amount of time it takes to solve a problem, or a mix of the above? Once the requirements have been decided and quantified the appropriate procurement route needs to be selected among a spectrum of possibilities ranging from pre-commercial procurement to stimulate Research and Development into innovative technologies to open procurements where the requirements could be met by current technologies.

40|$|A {{major problem}} {{related to the}} {{treatment}} of ecosystems is that they have no available mathematical formalization. This implies that many of their properties are not presented as short, rigorous modalities, but rather as long expressions which, from a biological standpoint, totally capture the significance of the property, but which have the disadvantage of not being sufficiently manageable, from a mathematical standpoint. The interpretation of ecosystems through networks allows us to employ the concepts of coverage and invariance alongside other related concepts. The latter will allow us to present the two most important relations in an ecosystem – predator–prey and competition – in a different way. Biological control, defined as “the use of living organisms, their resources or their products to prevent or reduce loss or damage caused by pests”, is now considered the environmentally safest and <b>most</b> <b>economically</b> <b>advantageous</b> method of pest control (van Lenteren, 2011). A guild includes all those organisms that share a common food resource (Polis et al., 1989), which in the context of biological control means all the natural enemies of a given pest. There are several types of intraguild interactions, but the one that has received most research attention is intraguild predation, which occurs when two organisms share the same prey {{while at the same time}} participating in some kind of trophic interaction. However, this is not the only intraguild relationship possible, and studies are now being conducted on others, such as oviposition deterrence. In this article, we apply the developed concepts of structural functions, coverage, invariant sets, etc. (Lloret et al., 1998, Esteve and Lloret, 2006 a, Esteve and Lloret, 2006 b and Esteve and Lloret, 2007) to a tritrophic system that includes aphids, one of the most damaging pests and a current bottleneck for the success of biological control in Mediterranean greenhouses...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to show how quality {{assurance}} of cultural heritage is made in public procurement. This has been done with an initial review of the current legislation, law on public procurement, which then is applied on a case study of one specific Municipality, Mölndals Stad. The case study is partly based on interviews and policy announcement and partly on two in-depth case studies. The first in-depth case study reviews tender documents regarding arrangements of cultural heritage and the second in-depth case study reviews the state of one specific property. These two in-depth case studies focus only on the cultural heritage in Mölndal that are pointed out as important cultural environments by the city council. The Law on public procurement, which acquired legal force 2008, states that all Swedish authorities are bound to procure goods and services to a rock-bottom price, or to the <b>most</b> <b>economically</b> <b>advantageous</b> tender. This commands a high demand on the responsible purchaser, and the tender documents, to ensure that the cultural value of the heritage doesn’t become corrupted. The Case study shows that quality assurance is made when the responsible purchaser is aware of the necessity to do it. But it also shows that this isn’t always the case. The estate manager of each property is given a big responsibility to ensure that the need for quality assurance is given when needed. The result of the study is that quality assurance for cultural heritage are possible to make in public procurement, but the Municipality need to improve their guidelines for when quality assurances are necessaryUppsats för avläggande av filosofie kandidatexamen i Kulturvård, Bebyggelseantikvariskt program 15 hp Institutionen för kulturvård Göteborgs universitet 2014 : 2...|$|R

40|$|Green public {{procurement}} (GPP) is about setting environmental criteria in the {{public procurement}} process alongside the traditional purchasing criteria, e. g. price, quality and technical features of products, services and works. GPP {{is considered to be}} one of the key policies that could be used to promote the change of unsustainable patterns of consumption and production. The use of environmental procurement criteria has increased during this decennium, as it has been promoted by many international and national policies and programmes. Nevertheless, how does this push for greener public procurement comply with the primary aims of public procurement legislation – guaranteeing the best value for taxpayers’ money and the operability of the internal market? The challenge is to combine economic and environmental issues so that purchasing decisions are compliant with law and jurisprudence. In this thesis, this issue is analyzed by examining the relations of environmental and economic aspects as well as environmental and legal aspects in public procurement. This thesis uses several methods and tools to assess the greenness of public procurement; an analysis of purchasing criteria, life cycle assessment and eco-label criteria. Environmental criteria found in the tender documents are mirrored to the existing European procurement directives and case law. The relation between economy and environment is studied within the concept of the <b>most</b> <b>economically</b> <b>advantageous</b> tender as defined in the EU’s public procurement directives. Its content and applicability in the assessment of economic and environmental performance of a purchase is opened for discussion. The results of this thesis suggest that economical, environmental and legal aspects can be combined in public procurement, though the linking of green criteria is specific to a single contract. Despite the increased amount of green criteria in tender documents (i. e. calls for tenders and contracts), they mainly focus on those aspects that are undoubtedly covered by the procurement directives – possibly excluding some of the important environmental impacts of the product or service from a life cycle perspective. However, systematically presented green criteria in calls for tenders could give a signal to the manufacturers of the demand for environmentally preferable solutions, and encourage them to invest in developing green products, i. e. eco-design...|$|R
40|$|Competitive Dialogue (CD) {{is a new}} {{contract}} award procedure of the European Community (EC). It is set out in Article 29 of the 'Public Sector Directive' 2004 / 18 /EC. Over the last decades, projects were {{becoming more and more}} complex, and the existing EC procedures were no longer suitable to procure those projects. The call for a new procedure resulted in CD. This paper describes how the Directive has been implemented into the laws of two member states: the UK and the Netherlands. In order to implement the Directive, both lawmakers have set up a new and distinct piece of legislation. In each case, large parts of the Directive’s content have been repeated ‘word for word’; only minor parts have been reworded and/or restructured. In the next part of the paper, the CD procedure is examined in different respects. First, an overview is given on the different EC contract award procedures (open, restricted, negotiated, CD) and awarding methods (lowest price and <b>Most</b> <b>Economically</b> <b>Advantageous</b> Tender, MEAT). Second, the applicability of CD is described: Among other limitations, CD can only be applied to public contracts for works, supplies, and services, and this scope of application is further restricted by the exclusion of certain contract types. One such exclusion concerns services concessions. This means that PPP contracts which are set up as services concessions cannot be awarded by CD. The last two parts of the paper pertain to the main features of the CD procedure – from ‘contract notice’ to ‘contract award’ – and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the procedure. One advantage is that the dialogue allows the complexity of the project to be disentangled and clarified. Other advantages are the stimulation of innovation and creativity. These advantages are set against the procedure’s disadvantages, which include high transaction costs and a perceived hindrance of innovation (due to an ambiguity between transparency and fair competition). It is concluded that all advantages and disadvantages are related to one of three elements: communication, competition, and/or structure of the procedure. Further research is needed to find out how these elements are related...|$|R
40|$|In the mid 1990 s a {{previous}} prohibitions against multi-story buildings higher than two floors {{with a wooden}} frame was changed. Today multi-storey buildings are being built in Skellefteå, Sundsvall, Växjö, and Stockholm with others. Despite this only one of five houses being built today has a wooden frame. Since the municipality is a key force to get projects with wooden frames, this papers purpose is to improve tender document {{for the opportunity to}} submit bids and building with wooden frames. To help us forward with our work three questions were formulated. 1) What is the basis from a wooden constructions company perspective, of which they determines if they can place a bid or not? 2) What is the difference between tender documents made by a municipality compared to a private buyer? 3) How can tender documents be improved to create an opportunity to place a bid containing an alternative frame system? To answer these questions a literature study was carried out. The literature study is the basis of this paper. To obtain empirical data a document analysis of tender documents was carried out. The result of the study shows that wood frames are hard to adapt to an already finished technical specification, or to a tender document containing an extensive technical specification. To obtain alternative solutions, the buyer should focus on object design, form and function, or a general technical specification. Instead the technical specifications should be drawn up by the supplier, or in collaboration with them. The tender evaluation should be made by the <b>most</b> <b>economically</b> <b>advantageous</b> rather then the lowest price. Then the buyer can evaluate the offers against each other, rather then choosing the lowest price. This also gives the possibility for suppliers to make a bid containing an alternative solution. As a continuation of this paper, we recommend a study on which impact a general technical specification has on the project final cost.   Furthermore a study exploring which possibilities partner procurement can have alternative solutions in the Swedish procurement act. This report deal exclusively with how tender documents should be formulated. Life cycle analysis, carbon dioxide emissions and strength calculations will not be executed. ...|$|R
40|$|The Master Thesis {{deals with}} the {{adoption}} of building information modeling or BIM into the Slovenian public procurement system. We have carried out {{a detailed analysis of}} the possibility of introducing BIM within the current legislation on public procurement. It is described how public clients can approach the implementation through tenders for public works contracts and how tenderers for design or construction can adapt. We have highlighted the potential impact of the implementation {{on the quality of the}} final products and the construction process itself. Due to the global financial crisis the development of Slovenian construction sector has fallen behind the leading European and world countries. One of the construction industry areas where this is most obvious is building information modeling. Due to the complexity and uniqueness of construction projects, many foreign countries have decided to introduce BIM into the public procurement system through their legislation, which is now encouraged with the European directive. For this reason, it makes sense to find out why the implementation in Slovenia has not yet occurred, how it could be done and what would the benefits for the State, public clients and tenderers (design and construction companies) be. For this a brief summary of the main features of BIM, Slovenian procurement system and different contractual relations has been made in the first part of the Master Thesis. The second part includes a detailed analysis of different means of introducing BIM in public construction contracts via requirements, tender conditions and criteria for the selection of the <b>most</b> <b>economically</b> <b>advantageous</b> tender and presents change requirements in the national strategy and the development of guidance and normative documents. Particular emphasis is placed on the implementation period and the necessary changes in contractual relations. Comparing Slovenia with foreign countries has allowed us to determine the main advantages of BIM implementation for public clients: the efficient use of public funds, increased quality of construction projects and improved communication and coordination. The third part provides the perspective of tenderers and an analysis of the effects that the BIM implementation would have on them. Requirements for the proper BIM implementation into the firms' workflows and mutual cooperation on projects have also been discovered and presented. The main advantages of the implementation such as better and faster execution of projects and increased business competitiveness have been velidated by comparison with abroad. Analysis of both aspects (the State and the tenderers) have provided the basis for the conclusion that adoption of BIM is necessary to improve the quality of public procurement and should be encouraged by the government, as the current situation does not provide sufficient incentives for companies to develop in the direction of BIM...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Building {{innovation}} {{literature and}} policy documents state that public clients should evaluate bids {{on the highest}} value-price ratio, but as an ongoing investigation into <b>Economically</b> <b>Most</b> <b>Advantageous</b> Tender (EMAT) award mechanisms applied in the Dutch construction industry shows, in practice hardly any mechanism exists that explicitly defines {{the total value of}} offers. This paper investigates that discrepancy for the so-called price correction mechanism by mapping it into the value-price model. Therefore the two options of preference determination, namely value minus price or value divided by price, need to be explored. The result of this procedure is the conclusion that with the current price correction mechanisms the total value is determined in an implicit way, {{and that it would be}} better to determine the total value of offers explicitly. Furthermore it becomes evident that with price correction mechanisms preference is based on value minus price rather than value divided by price, which is strange from a theoretical point of view...|$|R
40|$|The EU {{procurement}} directives {{stipulate that}} public contracts are {{awarded to the}} lowest bidder or to the bidder with the <b>economically</b> <b>most</b> <b>advantageous</b> offer; the latter requiring that a scoring rule must be specified. We provide a simple theoretical framework for tender evaluation and discuss {{the pros and cons}} of common scoring rules, e. g., highest quality (beauty contest) and price-and-quality-based evaluation. Some descriptive facts are presented for a sample of Swedish public procurements. We argue that the most common method, price-to-quality scoring, is flawed for several reasons. It is non-transparent, making accurate representation of the procurer’s preferences difficult. It is often open to strategic manipulation, due to dependence on irrelevant alternatives, and it is unreasonably non-linear in bid prices. We prefer quality-to-price scoring, where money values are assigned to different quality levels. When the costs of quality are relatively well-known, however, lowest price is the preferable award criteria. Public Contracts; Public Procurement; Scoring Rules; Quality...|$|R
