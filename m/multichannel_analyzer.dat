5000|$|Ghiorso invented {{numerous}} {{techniques and}} machines for isolating and identifying heavy elements atom-by-atom. He is generally credited with implementing the <b>multichannel</b> <b>analyzer</b> and {{the technique of}} recoil to isolate reaction products, although both of these were significant extensions of previously understood concepts. His concept for {{a new type of}} accelerator, the Omnitron, is acknowledged to have been a brilliant advance that probably would have enabled the Berkeley lab to discover numerous additional new elements, but the machine was never built, a victim of the evolving political landscape of the 1970s in the U.S. that de-emphasized basic nuclear research and greatly expanded research on environmental, health, and safety issues. Partially {{as a result of the}} failure to build the Omnitron, Ghiorso (together with colleagues Bob Main and others) conceived the joining of the HILAC and the Bevatron, which he called the Bevalac. This combination machine, an ungainly articulation across the steep slope at the Rad Lab, provided heavy ions at GeV energies, thereby enabling development of two new fields of research: [...] "high-energy nuclear physics," [...] meaning that the compound nucleus is sufficiently hot to exhibit collective dynamical effects, and heavy ion therapy, in which high-energy ions are used to irradiate tumors in cancer patients.
