30|$|Based on {{the model}} above, an adversary {{successfully}} <b>modifies</b> <b>the</b> packet that he can construct the logical hash symbol after <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> data symbols (actually here he <b>modifies</b> <b>the</b> pseudopackets). From the following theorem {{we will find that}} an adversary can construct a logical hash symbol after <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> data symbols with a very low probability.|$|R

30|$|Secondly, by <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> {{scheduling}} result we {{can obtain}} a better total execution time which meets the real-time constraint without <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> partitioning. This {{is because the}} characteristics of the tasks (mainly execution time) are <b>modified</b> according to <b>the</b> nature of the input data.|$|R
5|$|In 1981 Karl Huggins <b>modified</b> <b>the</b> US Navy 6 {{compartment}} model using M values derived {{to follow}} the Spencer no-decompression limits. The tables are exclusively for no-decompression diving and are presented in the same format as the US Navy tables.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} glaciations further <b>modified</b> <b>the</b> region {{starting}} about 2 to 3 {{million years ago}} and ending sometime around 10,000 BP. At least four major glaciations {{have occurred in the}} Sierra Nevada, locally called the Sherwin (also called the pre-Tahoe), Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga. The Sherwin glaciers were the largest, filling Yosemite and other valleys, while later stages produced much smaller glaciers. A Sherwin-age glacier was almost surely responsible for the major excavation and shaping of Yosemite Valley and other canyons in the area.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{discussion}} {{about how the}} episode should end, the writers decided {{that they did not}} want Barney to return to being drunk {{at the end of the}} episode. Barney stayed sober for several seasons. The animators <b>modified</b> <b>the</b> appearance of the character, straightening his hair, among other things, to indicate his sobriety. Castellaneta altered his voice for the character by no longer slurring. Barney was still seen at Moe's Tavern, but only drinking lattes. The character's new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer-producer David Mirkin, who has friends who stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee.|$|E
5|$|After his {{position}} as sultan of Egypt and emir of Damascus was secured, Al-Adil started an extensive rebuilding programme of the citadel. Between 1203 and 1216, the old fortifications were razed and a larger castle was built at the same location, incorporating parts of the old Seljuq citadel. The lower Ayyubid princes were each required to finance and build {{one of the large}} towers of the citadel. Several of Al-Adil's Ayyubid successors rebuilt many of the administrative and domestic structures inside the citadel, including residences, palaces, and a pool. As-Salih Ayyub was the only successor who also <b>modified</b> <b>the</b> defences.|$|E
25|$|Mussorgsky rewrote the Terem Scene for <b>the</b> 1872 version, <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> text, {{adding new}} songs and plot devices (the parrot and <b>the</b> clock), <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> {{psychology}} of the title character, and virtually recomposing {{the music of the}} entire scene.|$|R
30|$|We {{assert that}} fire also affects {{nutrient}} availability, <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> dynamics of vegetation communities {{as well as}} loss of elements to water courses, given the frequent flooding of these wetlands, and <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> chemical composition of these water bodies.|$|R

5|$|After {{the station}} was closed it was almost {{immediately}} <b>modified.</b> <b>The</b> western headwalls of both platform tunnels were rebuilt to allow a step plate junction to be installed, providing access from the eastbound and westbound tunnels to a new siding located between Down Street and Hyde Park Corner. The siding is mainly used to reverse westbound trains, but {{could also be used}} for servicing trains. The siding tunnel is accessible at its western end through a small foot tunnel constructed from Hyde Park Corner station. The lifts were removed and the shafts adapted to provide additional tunnel ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Along the way, {{the story}} was greatly {{modified}} {{to make it more}} suitable as a family film. By the time it was completed in 1981, the film had changed into a chronicle of the unlikely friendship of two creatures, who should be natural enemies and who learn society sometimes tries to determine their roles despite their better impulses. In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die the same as in the novel, but Stevens did not want to have an on-screen death and <b>modified</b> <b>the</b> film so that he survived.|$|E
5|$|An 1872 statute <b>modified</b> <b>the</b> {{certificate}} of division procedure to require {{waiting for a}} final decision in the circuit court case first. In the interim, {{the opinion of the}} presiding judge was to prevail. An 1874 statute repealed the 1872 modification as to criminal cases, but left it in place as to civil cases.|$|E
50|$|In Ute, {{relative}} clauses that <b>modify</b> <b>the</b> subject {{are introduced}} {{in a different}} manner than those that <b>modify</b> <b>the</b> object. In both cases, there is no overt relativizer morpheme, rather nominalization and case morphology are used to introduce relative clauses.|$|R

This can be done by <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> prior covariance [...] or by <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> observation matrix both approaches lead to the same GEK predictor. When we construct direct GEK through the prior covariance matrix, we append the partial derivatives to , and <b>modify</b> <b>the</b> prior covariance matrix [...] such that it also contains the derivatives (and second derivatives) of the covariance function, see for example ...|$|R
5|$|Around 1954, NATC <b>modified</b> <b>the</b> sole {{surviving}} XAJ-1 {{to conduct}} inflight refueling tests using the probe and drogue configuration. The turbojet engine was removed and the fuel hose and its drogue extended {{out from the}} jet's former exhaust opening. Aircraft in service retained the turbojet and had their bomb bay doors modified to accommodate the hose and drogue. They were refueling aircraft during late 1954.|$|E
5|$|As the BBC {{broadcasting}} {{unit was}} about to order another batch of the monitor, {{it was found that}} the supplier had <b>modified</b> <b>the</b> drive units, meaning the LS3/5 design had to be fundamentally revised. The BBC's Designs Department was called upon to adapt the product in light of the supply changes. Modifications were made to adapt to the new drive units and deal with the altered resonance pattern, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A.|$|E
5|$|Between 1794 and 1795, in the {{aftermath}} of the French Revolution, the French government briefly mandated decimal clocks, with a day divided into 10hours of 100minutes each. The astronomer and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, among other individuals, <b>modified</b> <b>the</b> dial of his pocket watch to decimal time. A clock in the Palais des Tuileries kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread. Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the metric system, and it was abandoned.|$|E
40|$|Computer {{users with}} {{impaired}} dexterity often have difficulty accessing small, densely packed user interface elements. Past research in software-based solutions has mainly employed two approaches: <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> interface and <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> {{interaction with the}} cursor. Each approach, however, has limitations. <b>Modifying</b> <b>the</b> user interface by enlarging interactive elements makes access efficient for simple interfaces but increases the cost of navigation for complex ones by displacing items to screens that require tabs or scrolling to reach. <b>Modifying</b> <b>the</b> interaction with the cursor makes access possible to unmodified interfaces but may perform poorly on densely packed targets or require the user to perform multiple steps. We developed a new approach that combines {{the strengths of the}} existing approaches while minimizing their shortcomings, introducing only minimal distortion to the original interface while making access to frequently used parts of the user interface efficient and access to all other parts possible. We instantiated this concept as Adaptive Click-and-Cross, a novel interaction technique. Our user study demonstrates that, for sufficiently complex interfaces, Adaptive Click-and-Cross slightly improves the performance of users with impaired dexterity compared to only <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> interface or only <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> cursor...|$|R

5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{uses the}} SCUMM engine {{developed}} for Maniac Mansion. LucasArts had gradually <b>modified</b> <b>the</b> engine since its creation. For example, {{the number of}} input verbs was reduced and items in the character's inventory are represented by icons rather than text. While implementing an animation, the designers encountered a problem later discovered to be limitation of the engine. Upon learning of the limitation, Gilbert reminisced about the file size of the first game. The staff then resolved to include it in the sequel.|$|E
5|$|Déby {{attempted}} {{to reconcile the}} rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a new constitution by referendum, and in 1996, Déby easily won a competitive presidential election. He won a second term five years later. Oil exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would at last have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a new civil war broke out. Déby unilaterally <b>modified</b> <b>the</b> constitution to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{grouping}} of railway companies in 1923, the LSWR {{became part of}} the Southern Railway (SR) and its publicity department gave the N15locomotives names associated with Arthurian legend; the class hence becoming known as King Arthurs. The Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the newly formed company, Richard Maunsell, <b>modified</b> <b>the</b> Urie locomotives in the light of operational experience and increased the class strength to 74 locomotives. Maunsell and his Chief Draughtsman James Clayton incorporated several improvements, notably to the steam circuit and valve gear.|$|E
