As in autopolyploidy, this primarily occurs through the fusion of unreduced (2n) gametes, which can take place before or after hybridization. In the former case, unreduced gametes from each diploid taxa – or reduced gametes from two autotetraploid taxa – combine to form allopolyploid offspring. In the latter case, one or more diploid F1 hybrids produce unreduced gametes that fuse to form allopolyploid progeny. Hybridization followed by genome duplication {{may be a more}} common path to allopolyploidy because F1 hybrids between taxa often have relatively high rates of unreduced gamete formation – divergence between the genomes of the two taxa result in abnormal pairing between homoeologous chromosomes or nondisjunction during meiosis. In this case, allopolyploidy can actually restore normal, bivalent <b>meiotic</b> <b>pairing</b> by providing each homoeologous chromosome with its own homologue. If divergence between homoeologous chromosomes is even across the two subgenomes, this can theoretically result in rapid restoration of bivalent pairing and disomic inheritance following allopolyploidization.

Here, we report that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hop 1 protein, a component of SC, promotes pairing between two double-stranded DNA helices containing a centrally located G/C isochore. Significantly, pairing was rapid and robust, and required four contiguous G/C base pairs. Using a series of truncated DNA double helices we show that 20 bp {{on either side of}} 8 bp target G/C sequenceis essential for pairing.

Surprisingly, the analysis of <b>meiotic</b> <b>pairing</b> and synapsis for three lacO reporter couplets in FM 7 /X heterozygotes revealed they are paired and synapsed during zygotene/pachytene in 70 %- 80 % of oocytes. Moreover, the regions defined by these lacO couplets undergo double-strand break formation at normal frequency. Thus, even complex aberration heterozygotes usually allow high frequencies of <b>meiotic</b> <b>pairing,</b> synapsis, and double-strand break formation in Drosophila oocytes. However, the frequencies of failed pairing and synapsis were still 1. 5 - to 2 -fold higher than were observed for corresponding regions in oocytes with two normal sequence X chromosomes, and this effect was greatest near a breakpoint. We propose that heterozygosity for breakpoints creates a local alteration in synaptonemal complex structure that is propagated across long regions of the bivalent in a fashion analogous to chiasma interference, which also acts to suppress crossing over...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{relationship}} between <b>meiotic</b> <b>pairing</b> and progress of spermatogenesis, an analysis of male <b>meiotic</b> <b>pairing</b> {{was carried out in}} four reciprocal translocation heterozygotes and two double heterozygotes for two semi-identical reciprocal translocations. The reciprocal translocations were chosen to range from fertility (T 70 H/+) through almost complete sterility (T 31 H/+) to complete sterility (T 32 H/+, T 42 /H+). If <b>meiotic</b> <b>pairing</b> in the translocation multivalent was incomplete, it concerned terminal or probably more often proximal chromosome segments (Chain IV). If both segments failed to pair the multivalent symbol is Chain III + I. Complete pairing is symbolized by Ring IV. To contrast and complement observations of this type, the double heterozygotes were introduced. Males of this type in theory possess two heteromorphic bivalents with a central area of incomplete <b>meiotic</b> <b>pairing</b> (loop formation). Of the T 70 H/T 1 Wa double heterozygotes, 36 % of the males are capable of inducing at least one decidual reaction in two females whereas for T 26 H/T 2 Wa, 79 % of the males can do so. For the reciprocal translocations, it was found that proximity of the multivalent to the sex bivalent during pachytene increased in the order Ring IV, Chain IV, Chain III + I. The degree of spermatogenic impairment as measured from cell counts in histological sections and tubular whole mounts, is positively related to the frequency of proximity between the sex chromosomes and the translocation multivalent and thus to lack of <b>meiotic</b> <b>pairing</b> within the multivalent. The <b>meiotic</b> <b>pairing</b> analysis of the double heterozygotes yielded the following findings. For the long heteromorphic bivalents a true loop was never seen in T 70 H/T 1 Wa and only rarely observed in T 26 H/T 2 Wa. Small marker bivalents of both types were usually recognizable by the following criteria: pairing confined to distal or proximal segments, both distal and proximal segments pairing and loop formation and pairing covering the entire length of both "homologues" but the longer one often with a "thickened" lateral element. The same positive correlation between the absence of pairing (proximal, distal or central) and the proximity of the small marker bivalent synaptonemal complex to the sex bivalent has been found as for unpaired segments within reciprocal translocation multivalents.

40|$|Robertsonian {{chromosomes}} are metacentric chromosomes {{formed by}} the joining of two telocentric chromosomes at their centromere ends.

Our data provide evidence that the underlying mechanism of recombination suppression is mechanical interference in <b>meiotic</b> <b>pairing</b> between Robertsonian chromosomes and their telocentric partners. The fact that recombination suppression is specific to individual Robertsonian chromosomes suggests that the pairing delay is caused by minor structural differences between the Robertsonian chromosomes and their telocentric homologs and that these differences arise during Robertsonian formation. Further understanding of this pairing delay is important for mouse mapping studies. In 10 mouse chromosomes (3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15 and 19) the distances from the centromeres to first markers may still be underestimated because they have been determined using only Robertsonian chromosomes.

These specialized sites were first established on the X chromosome by noting that there were barriers to crossover suppression caused by translocation heterozygotes. These sites were genetically mapped and proposed to be pairing sites. By comparing the cytological breakpoints of third chromosome translocations to their patterns of crossover suppression, we have mapped two sites on chromosome 3 R. We have performed experiments to determine if these sites have a role in <b>meiotic</b> homolog <b>pairing</b> and the initiation of recombination. Translocation heterozygotes exhibit reduced gene conversion within the crossover-suppressed region, consistent with an effect on the initiation of meiotic recombination. To determine if homolog pairing is disrupted in translocation heterozygotes, we used fluorescent in situ hybridization to measure the extent of homolog pairing. In wild-type oocytes, homologs are paired along their entire lengths prior to accumulation of the SC protein C(3) G. Surprisingly, translocation heterozygotes exhibited homolog pairing similar to wild type within the crossover-suppressed regions. This result contrasted with our observations of c(3) G mutant females, which were found to be defective in pairing.

40|$|AbstractBackground: <b>Meiotic</b> <b>pairing</b> is {{essential}} for the proper orientation of chromosomes at the metaphase plate and their subsequent disjunction during anaphase I. In male Drosophila melanogaster, meiosis occurs in the absence of recombination or a recognizable synaptonemal complex (SC). Due to limitations in available cytological techniques, the early stages of homologous chromosome pairing in male Drosophila have not been observed, and the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Results: Chromosome tagging with GFP-Lac repressor protein allowed us to track, for the first time, the behavior of meiotic chromosomes at high resolution, live, at all stages of male Drosophila meiosis. Homologous chromosomes pair throughout the euchromatic regions in spermatogonia and during the early phases of spermatocyte development. Extensive separation of homologs and sister chromatids along the chromosome arms occurs in mid-G 2, several hours before the first meiotic division, and before the G 2 /M transition. Centromeres, on the other hand, show complex association patterns, with specific homolog pairing taking place in mid-G 2. These changes in chromosome pairing parallel changes in large-scale chromosome organization. Conclusions: Our results suggest that widespread interactions along the euchromatin are required for the initiation, but not the maintenance, of <b>meiotic</b> <b>pairing</b> of autosomes in male Drosophila. We propose that heterochromatic associations, or chromatid entanglement, may be responsible for the maintenance of homolog association during late G 2. Our data also suggest that the formation of chromosome territories in the spermatocyte nucleus may play an active role in ensuring the specificity of <b>meiotic</b> <b>pairing</b> in late prophase by disrupting interactions between nonhomologous chromosomes...|$|E

40|$|In the ciliate Tetrahymena, meiotic {{micronuclei}} (MICs) undergo extreme elongation, and <b>meiotic</b> <b>pairing</b> and recombination {{take place}} within these elongated nuclei (the “crescents”). We have previously shown that elongation does not occur {{in the absence of}} Spo 11 p-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here we show that elongation is restored in spo 11 Δ mutants by various DNA-damaging agents including ones that may not cause DSBs to a notable extent. MIC elongation following Spo 11 p-induced DSBs or artificially induced DNA lesions is probably a DNA-damage response mediated by a phosphokinase signal transduction pathway, since it is suppressed by the ATM/ATR kinase inhibitors caffeine and wortmannin and by knocking out Tetrahymena's ATR orthologue. MIC elongation occurs concomitantly with the movement of centromeres away from the telomeric pole of the MIC. This DNA damage–dependent reorganization of the MIC helps to arrange homologous chromosomes alongside each other but is not sufficient for exact pairing. Thus, Spo 11 p contributes to bivalent formation in two ways: by creating a favorable spatial disposition of homologues and by stabilizing pairing by crossovers.
