25|$|The {{plan was}} for the infiltrators to <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> local populace and incite them to rebellion. Meanwhile, guerilla warfare would commence, {{destroying}} bridges, tunnels and highways, as well as Indian Army installations and airfields, creating conditions for an 'armed insurrection' in Kashmir. If the attempt failed, Pakistan hoped to have raised international attention to the Kashmir issue. Using the newly acquired sophisticated weapons through the American arms aid, Pakistan believed that it could achieve tactical victories in a quick limited war.|$|E

In addition to the PLA Forces Hong Kong Building, there are notable garrisons at the Stonecutters Island, and at Stanley Fort.

The soldiers are not permitted to leave their compounds, even during off-duty times to <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> local populace. As a military property, the PLA Forces Hong Kong Building is heavily guarded by very alert soldiers with machine guns. It is best to photograph it from somewhere along Harcourt Road and not to attract too much attention.|$|E

25|$|People {{migrated}} {{from across the}} border into Pakistan were all ethnically diverse. Migrants that settled in the province of Punjab were predominantly Punjabi speaking people and amalgamated well with the natives, whilst the people that came into the territories of the province of Sindh found no bond with the natives of Sindh, neither cultural nor racial, not even religious at times. Most Sindhi natives were Hindus. The new emigrants found difficult to <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> native neighbours in their newly allotted homes. And even decades after independence, the tensions seems to rise even steeper limits. The emigrants were given a new identity, a new name – Muhajirs.|$|E
25|$|This type {{of action}} was typical all along D Company's assault line and every time the Australians {{received}} fire from a building, tank rounds were used to breach the walls and a small team of infantry would conduct room clearance until all resistance was quelled. During the fighting some of the VC had discarded their uniforms and weapons and attempted to <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pockets of civilians that were unable to escape. The continued presence of civilians in the village required the Australians to expose themselves to extreme danger while trying to usher these groups {{to the rear of}} the battle zone. Others tried to flee the village, or hide in the small air raid bunkers attached to every house. The fighting continued all afternoon and only ended at last light. With Binh Ba still insecure, D Company and their armoured support subsequently occupied a defensive harbour for the night, exhausted by the fighting. Overnight B Company killed two VC trying to break out to the south.|$|E
25|$|Tsar Alexander II died on 13 March 1881, when {{after visiting}} his cousin Grand Duchess Catherine Mikhailovna he was assassinated {{on the road}} leading back to the Winter Palace. His death stopped all plans for Catherine's coronation, which some {{considered}} fortunate, as they feared it would have caused lasting damage to the monarchy. In his Will, Alexander II left his widow the same amount he bequeathed to each of his sons from his first marriage. Despite his earlier opposition, the tsar's son, now Alexander III, made an official visit of condolence to Catherine and gave her an additional allowance {{as well as a}} small palace for her to live in after she left the Winter Palace. George and his family attended the tsar's funeral, but they were ignored as much as possible by the Imperial family, until Alexander III himself approached his father's widow and spoke to her. His wife, Tsarina Maria Feodorovna was nearby, but as she had been greatly opposed to the princess, she hesitated to acknowledge her. After being embraced by Catherine however, they both broke down crying, and George and his sisters kissed Maria's hand. The couple left, and the widow and children went to another private chapel for a separate mass, as she was not to be allowed to <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Imperial family in the more public funeral planned for later.|$|E

500|$|The skyline of {{the center}} panel (220 × 195cm, 87 × 77in) matches exactly {{with that of the}} left wing, while the {{positioning}} of its central pool and the lake behind it echoes the lake [...] in the earlier scene. The center image depicts the expansive [...] "garden" [...] landscape which gives the triptych its name. The panel shares a common horizon with the left wing, suggesting a spatial connection between the two scenes. The garden is teeming with male and female nudes, together with a variety of animals, plants and fruit. The setting is not the paradise shown in the left panel, but neither is it based in the terrestrial realm. Fantastic creatures <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> real; otherwise ordinary fruits appear engorged to a gigantic size. The figures are engaged in diverse amorous sports and activities, both in couples and in groups. Gibson describes them as behaving [...] "overtly and without shame", while art historian Laurinda Dixon writes that the human figures exhibit [...] "a certain adolescent sexual curiosity".|$|E

500|$|Patrick Duffy {{returned}} to Dallas in 1986 after being absent {{for an entire}} season. The whole year's worth of episodes was written off entirely as Pam's dream. The storyline garnered the show a lot of publicity, both good and bad. The Staff of UGO Networks.com said: [...] "Soap Operas are known (and at times hated) for their ridiculously implausible storylines, and while '80s primetime suddser Dallas {{is still one of}} our favorite guilty pleasures, even the great Ewing empire is not immune to the absurd storytelling techniques the genre has become associated with. While your average primetime soap operas don't usually <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> stuff of sci-fi and horror, there's an incredibly high rate of characters returning from the dead in the genre. Case in point: Bobby Ewing. Presumed dead after being run over by his sister-in-law, Katherine Wentworth, who also happened to be obsessed with him, fans (and CBS) had to do without Patrick Duffy, and even worse, ratings, for one whole season. Thus, Larry Hagman, who played Duffy's onscreen brother and despised oil baron J.R. Ewing, along with network execs, persuaded Duffy to return, making it possible (we're talking in soap opera terms here), for Bobby Ewing's character to come back by writing off the ratings nightmare of a season as a dream... a very bad one." ...|$|E

While the attempts by the Cocoon fal'Cie to revive him in Final Fantasy XIII failed, Bhunivelze awakens in the aftermath of Final Fantasy XIII-2 when Granpulse is being transformed into Nova Chrysalia from its mingling with the Unseen Realm. Though Bhunivelze attempts to stop corruption, he gradually accepts that the Nova Chrysalia is beyond saving and makes Lightning the savior to saves the souls of those still alive in preparation for the birth of a new world. His wish is to purge humanity of their memories by destroying the dead, leaving them free of all burdens and knowing only happiness in the new world. While having the Order of Salvation carry out his plans for humanity, he makes Hope his host and conditions Lightning to become the replacement for Etro. When Lightning chooses to rebel and thwarts the Order's mission, allowing the souls of the dead to <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> living, Bhunivelze decides to destroy all souls along with his new world with the intent to create his own version of humanity that are practically extensions of himself. Lightning fights Bhunivelze, wounding him and freeing Hope's soul before uniting with the souls of humanity to defeat him. After his defeat, Lightning states that even if he survived, humanity would defeat him once again.|$|E
500|$|They {{met with}} Katzenberg {{at a conference}} table in the Team Disney {{building}} at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. Catmull and Smith considered {{it would be difficult}} to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant. Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: [...] "Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I am a tyrant. But I'm usually right." [...] He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: [...] "John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way." [...] He invited the six visitors to <b>mingle</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> animators—"ask them anything at all"—and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements. Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began negotiations. Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal with Disney. Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar's proprietary technology for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused. In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg refused. Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July. Eventually, the deal specified that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues. It had the option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar's next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film. Disney could also kill the film at any time with only a small penalty. These early negotiations would become a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years.|$|E
