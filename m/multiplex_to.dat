ABS-CBN planned to utilize <b>multiplex</b> <b>to</b> offer ABS-CBN, S+A and 5 additional specialty TV channels. The conglomerate is expected {{to spend at least}} 1 billion pesos annually for the next 5 years for its DTT transition. ABS-CBN utilized UHF channel 51 Manila (695.143MHz), later UHF Channel 43(647.143MHz), for test broadcasts in the DVB-T format. ABS-CBN was expected to begin digital test broadcasts in January 2009.|$|E
25|$|The Independent Television Commission (ITC) {{allocated}} each existing {{analogue terrestrial}} channel half {{the capacity of}} a multiplex each. This meant the BBC got a <b>multiplex</b> <b>to</b> themselves (Multiplex 1), ITV and Channel 4 shared Multiplex 2 (though 3% of the capacity was given to Teletext Ltd.) and Channel 5 and S4C shared Multiplex A. The remaining spectrum (Multiplexes B, C and D) was then auctioned off. A consortium made up of Granada and Carlton (members of the ITV network, which have now merged to form ITV plc) and BSkyB successfully bid for these licences, and set-up the subscription ONdigital service, though BSkyB left the consortium prior to launch.|$|E

Under the 2007 Act, the BCI is required to license commercial DTT in the State. In the first instance, the BCI will seek to license three DTT multiplex operators for the establishment, maintenance and roll-out of commercial DTT in Ireland. In the future one further multiplex will be assigned to RTÉ and one <b>multiplex</b> <b>to</b> the BCI for licensing. A public DTT Information Campaign is planned from March 2009.|$|E
