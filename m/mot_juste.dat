Let the discriminating reader, who {{at times}} may well spare {{a moment or two}} to the consideration and enjoyment of artistic excellence, be asked to reflect a little upon the texture of two stories included in this volume: [...] "A Piece of String," [...] and [...] "A Sale." [...] How many openings the last offers for the gratuitous display of the author's wit or clever buffoonery, the first for an unmeasured display of sentiment! And both sentiment and buffoonery could have been made very good too, in a way accessible to the meanest intelligence, at the cost of truth and honesty. Here it is where Maupassant's austerity comes in. He refrains from setting his cleverness against the eloquence of the facts. There is humour and pathos in these stories; but such is the greatness of his talent, the refinement of his artistic conscience, that all his high qualities appear inherent in the very things of which he speaks, {{as if they had been}} altogether independent of his presentation. Facts, and again facts are his unique concern. That is why he is not always properly understood. His facts are so perfectly rendered that, like the actualities of life itself, they demand from the reader the faculty of observation which is rare, the power of appreciation which is generally wanting in most of us who are guided mainly by empty phrases requiring no effort, demanding from us no qualities except a vague susceptibility to emotion. Nobody has ever gained the vast applause of a crowd by the simple and clear exposition of vital facts. Words alone strung upon a convention have fascinated us as worthless glass beads strung on a thread have charmed at all times our brothers the unsophisticated savages of the islands. Now, Maupassant, of whom it has been said that he is the master of the <b>mot</b> <b>juste,</b> has never been a dealer in words. His wares have been, not glass beads, but polished gems; not the most rare and precious, perhaps, but of the very first water of their kind.|$|E

The Lancashire Oaks winner Sacred Song started {{favourite}} ahead of the Irish Oaks runner-up <b>Mot</b> <b>Juste</b> with Super Tassa starting the 25/1 outsider in a nine-runner field. The other runners were Head In The Clouds, Karsavina (third in the Irish Oaks), Snowflake (second in the Nassau Stakes), Zanzibar (Oaks d'Italia), Nafisa (Ballymacoll Stud Stakes) and Rockerlong (Cheshire Oaks). Super Tassa was held up by Darley in the early stages as first <b>Mot</b> <b>Juste</b> and then Snowflake set the pace before the Italian mare began to move forward half a mile from the finish. Sacred Song took the lead in the straight but Super Tassa went to the front approaching the final furlong and held on to win by a length from the favourite, with Rockerlong two and a half lengths back in third place. She was the first Italian-trained horse to win a major race in Britain since Marguerite Vernaut won the Champion Stakes in 1960. After the race Valiani said: [...] "The plan was always to come here after she won a Group 2 in Italy in April. York was the perfect track for her. She likes a strong pace and a long straight. She did work very well on Friday, so we were quite confident. I was worried because she got a bit upset beforehand and sometimes she can be a hard ride. But Kevin Darley was very good. Cyril chose him and said he was a mature jockey who knew York very well. We thought about retiring her to stud and I think she deserved it.|$|E

As a rule it is easier both to swear and to analyze dispassionately in an acquired language."

30|$|My {{argument}} views literature {{primarily as}} a specialized use of language and proposes a fundamental opposition between the literary use of language in romantic works especially in drama and the ordinary and practical use of language in modern drama. I propose that the central function of ordinary language is to communicate to audiences a message about the world existing outside of language. In contrast, literary language {{can be seen as}} self-focused, offering the reader a special mode of experience by drawing attention to its own formal features, such as linguistic signs, which are used in modern drama as a substitute for the rhetorical language of romantic drama. Another aspect of language is the influential formulation of estrangement or defamiliarization (Abrams 1999, 4), effects achieved by disrupting the modes of ordinary linguistic discourse. Literature makes strange the world of everyday perception and renews the reader’s lost capacity for fresh sensation. Estrangement is effected through techniques deployed by the playwright. For instance, to show the lack of communication from which modern men and women suffer, the playwright fills their attempts at making friendly conversation with repetitions, struggles to find the <b>mot</b> <b>juste,</b> and inarticulation (this last technique used mainly when the character is under great psychological pressure).|$|E
40|$|The {{body of work}} on Translation Didactics is {{not well}} {{developed}} for the Spanish-French language combination and consequently few textbooks exist [...] particularly as far as professional translation didactics is concerned. Using Jean Delisle's La traduction raisonnée (1993) as a model, this Master's thesis attempts to fill this pedagogical void by presenting a method based on general and specific learning objectives which address selected translation difficulties from Spanish to French. Based on a corpus consisting of a Spanish book and its French translation by student translators, this thesis aims to systematise learning practices. The general learning objectives are classified into difficulties of lexicon, syntax, and style. The specific learning objectives present theoretical reflections with translation examples. Also included are the sources of these observations and some practical exercises, consisting of passages in which the difficulty examined is particularly salient (translating mismo, propio, false cognates, the pretérito and the verbal phrase ir + gerund, finding the <b>mot</b> <b>juste</b> and attaining concision, as well as dealing with passages presenting difficulties with an implicit subject, the possessive adjective su, complex sentences and unclear source text, repetition, indirect speech and multilingualism).

40|$|Global Governance {{represents}} {{a new way}} of thinking about the world we live in. This new vision of Global Governance is the result of two converging forces. One is historical, the other conceptual. One {{is the fact that the}} world is growing closer empirically, linked by the thousands of wires and streams of information and satellites and phones and screens and jet-planes that bind us now. Conceptually, the world needs to be able to step outside itself and see itself and then develop a language to capture that new vision. We can view the globe as one unit with, not necessarily a government, but certainly a system of governance. The fact that there is no world government does not mean that there is no system of global governance. It is a place, it is a polity, it has a system by which authority is shared and spread and used; and for that the new word "governance" that has emerged in the academic literature is the <b>mot</b> <b>juste.</b> It has no implication of entitlement to decide, it is simply a word to describe a process. The first part, with six essays, looks thematically at different elements or facets of Global Governance and the issues that arise. The second half of this volume deals with some regional perspectives on Global Governance. Our aim in this book is to raise our eyes beyond the currently known world in public administration and look at the new unit of analysis clearly. It is the world we could win...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOld English texts {{emphasize}} {{the fact that}} people should primarily be good listeners. The scop was an expert in manipulating the verbal art, a spokesman for the glory of the king and the thanes. God’s own words are repeated in the biblical paraphrases. The Christian lyrics express the religious feeling of devout speakers spreading Christ’s teaching. Poetry is therefore divinely inspired and the poet is required to glorify God through his compositions. Yet the damned will be in great numbers for there are many who pervert words, twisting their true meaning: Satan and other demons, fallen angels, boasters, and conceited human beings. All of them challenge the value of truth, the deep value of language by resorting to lies and self-praise. As loyalty was the primary heroic value, words were expected to be true. This is why many secular works deal with the connection between words and betrayal /or engagement. And this is why, whatever genre and whatever subject, all Old English texts lay emphasis on the importance of the right word, on the necessary equivalence between the word and the thing. Les textes vieil-anglais soulignent l’idée que chacun doit, avant tout, savoir écouter. Le scop était un expert dans l’art de manipuler les mots, il chantait la gloire du roi et de ses compagnons. Les paraphrases bibliques vieil-anglaises insistent sur le rôle de vecteurs de la parole divine que sont les prophètes et autres élus. Dans les élégies chrétiennes, le poète traduit en langage humain les mystères qui nous dépassent. La poésie est donc louange, chant de gloire au Créateur. Nombreux, toutefois, seront les damnés pour avoir fait mauvais usage des mots et de la parole : Satan et autres démons, anges déchus, prétentieux, hâbleurs. Tous remettent en question la valeur même du langage en ayant recours au mensonge et à la forfanterie.

40|$|Extract] In a short piece {{entitled}} 'Poetry {{is playing}} with words', the late Mozambican poet José Craveirinha (1922 - 2003) discusses his work and his place as a writer in the new postcolonial nation. > Speaking of poetry as 'an act of passion', he states: 'I have never been preoccupied [...] . with having my work published. My friends are more responsible for that than I am. " However, since poets {{are in the business}} of clarity, he elaborates by lamenting the fact that '[i]n Mozambique to be a poet is not a profeSSIon. For the writing of poetry to be a profession, poetry must be valued; it must be essential. For the writing of poetry to be a profession, the poet must become more important than the soccer star. ' 5 This is Craveirinha at his best - ambiguous about the worth of his work, ambivalent on his role within contemporary Mozambican writing in Portuguese. The tension is obvious. Craveirinha wants both to be taken seriously as a poet and, crucially, as a Mozambican poet, and claims to be 'attract[ed] to poetry [simply by the act of] playing with words, that constant search for the right word. which is precisely what poetry is'. 6 for a poet, intent on capturing the essence of the thing in the <b>mot</b> <b>juste,</b> Craveirinha is surprisingly vague, if not distinctly obtuse, when it comes to defining what it is that has made him one of the most exciting voices in the writing of the territories formerly colonized by Portugal. 7 Most of all, Craveirinha betrays in the statement quoted above some of the unease he repeatedly voices about the role of the artist as political activist. He wants us to believe that as a poet he is essentially playing with words, that he is a dilettante - a stance his work so vehemently contradicts; and, in this view, politics are of no consequence. Indeed, one might suggest that Jose Craveirinha's unique place within contemporary Lusophone African writing has always hinged on this uncanny ability to appear diffident, to eschew the limelight. At a time when minor figures in Lusophone writing were being teted at conferences and seminars in Portugal, Brazil, and elsewhere, Craveirinha remained largely at his desk at the University Eduardo Mondlane in Maputo. 8 If anything, he seemed intent on cultivating the marginal streak that now marked him as a writer, and that he stressed in his own assessments of his life and work as a Mozambican poet...|$|E
40|$|In the {{development}} of the English Novel, one of the recognizable trends is the gradually emerging conception of the novel as Art. From Richardson, Austen, Eliot, Meredith, to James and Conrad, the critic can trace the increasing involvement of the novelist in the discovery and perfection of techniques which would make it possible to represent in the novel life as it appears to the intelligent observer. Ford Madox Ford followed this trend in the novel and carried the form to new heights through the methods he evolved. [...] Surrounded by artists and writers from birth, Ford naturally took up a career in writing. Strongly encouraged by his maternal grandfather, Ford Madox Brown, he found early success in the publication of a fairy-tale, The Brown Owl (1892). A second fairy-tale, The Feather, and his first novel, The Shifting of the Fire, were produced within the same year. During the following eight years, Ford published two volumes of poems, a third fairy- story, a biography of Ford Madox Brown, and The Cinque Ports, {{the first of a series}} of studies on significant areas of England. [...] By 1900, Ford was established as a stylist of note. In that year he met Joseph Conrad and by the next year was involved in writing The Inheritors, the first of their three collaborations. This proved to be a turning point in Ford's career, for Conrad's absorption in his creative writings drew Ford away from the indolent, desultory approach he had had and forced him to formulate his theory of fiction. After working with Conrad, Ford knew much about the techniques he believed should be implemented in his craft, but he had not crystallized what he wanted to say. [...] During the following decade he produced fifteen novels. Notable among them is his historical trilogy of Henry VIII's fifth queen, published under the titles The Fifth Queen (1906), Privy Seal (1907), and The Fifth Queen Crowned (1908). It was justifiably hailed by the critics of his day, for Ford's insight into the historical personages, his remarkable recreation of the sixteenth- century milieu, and the obvious command he wielded over the tools of his craft, raised the genre of historical fiction to new heights. The medieval period fascinated Ford so much that he wrote four other novels devoted to the folklore and superstitions of that time. The "Half Moon" (1909), presents the power of witch-craft in the period; Ladies Whose Bright Eyes (1911, and revised in 1935), gives a fascinating account of a twentieth-century man transferred back into the fourteenth century, who gains new understandings by which to measure his own way of life; and The Young Lovell (1913), is a pleasing study of knight-errantry. A fourth historical novel, The Portrait (1910), presents an unsuccessful account of the wits and fops of the reign of William and Mary. [...] But it was in his novels of 'small circles' that Ford really began to develop his particular view of life. In The Benefactor (1905), and, much more thoroughly, in A Call (1910), he explored the peculiar situation of individuals caught at cross purposes in the conflict between the dictates of passion, an apparently outmoded code of behaviour, and the necessity to preserve some surface acceptable to the society within which they move. He attempted to broaden the field of his explorations through social satires including large groups of people in Mr. Apollo (1908), The Simple Life Limited (1911), The New Humpty-Dumpty (1912), and Mr. Fleight (1913). Only the first of these is in any way appealing, having sympathetically drawn characters revealed with depth, and an attractive philosophy of faith persuasively presented; whereas the remaining three novels give characters much more superficially drawn, with a philosophy of expediency chiefly distinguished by its coldness and harshness. Stimulated by the crucial events of 1914, Ford formulated what he wanted to say. After the many experiments of the preceeding novels, he had perfected the technique of point of view, time-shift, selection, justification, le <b>mot</b> <b>juste</b> and progression d'effet, which enabled him in The Good Soldier (1915), to state, with overwhelming power and truth, the plight of twentieth-century man, terrifyingly alone in an incomprehensible situation, with all systems of communication broken down. In making explicit 'the saddest story', joining psychological insight with consummate artistry, Ford achieves the stature of a great novelist. [...] Eight years later, he published The Marsden Case, a disappointing novel when compared to The Good Soldier, but interesting for the study it provides of Ford's attempt to broaden the scope of the material he used in The Good Soldier, to widen the 'small circle' to include a larger segment of society. The novel fails chiefly because of the inadequacy of the single point of view through which all events must be seen. However, the experiment proved fruitful, for in the next year, 1924, Ford published Some Do Not, the first of the Tietjens tetralogy. In 1925 No More Parades was published, followed by A Man Could Stand Up (1926), and The Last Post (1928). In the tetralogy, Ford gives fullest expression to his view of twentieth-century man alienated from all that gave stability, coherence, and contentment to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, unable to find within his society any foundations on which to build a new way of life, caught in a personal struggle that mirrors, and is mirrored in, the public struggle of World War I. The breadth and depth of psychological study, the emotional power and artistry with which Ford makes his statement, emphasizes the fact that The Good Soldier was no flash-in- the-pan, that Ford was indeed capable of producing more than one masterpiece. The Tietjens series proves this as it brings the twentieth-century world into focus, allowing the reader to see much about his society that perhaps he had only dimly perceived before, or of which he had been totally unaware. [...] After The Last Post, Ford wrote six novels. None of them measures up to the standard of his two masterpieces. Most of them show flashes of the creative genius that is so apparent in his greatest works, but all of them give evidence of haste and lack of involvement of the author. In the last period of his life, Ford was mainly concerned with critical works and memoirs, dashing off novels in between them that must be dismissed, then, as potboilers. [...] However, it is enough that Ford has given the world, not one, but two great works. In The Good Soldier, he presents a novel perfect in every aspect of its form; in the Tietjens tetralogy, he gives, if not an entirely flawless performance, a work of compelling power. Both rank with the best that has been produced in this century...|$|E
