It reveals that state policies and social norms deeply embedded in the Greek culture, rather than encouraging acquisition of 'full-citizenship' and financial independence, restrict young people's chances for independence from the family. As is the case in other southern European countries, in Greece, the family and informal clientelistic networks of relatives and friends have acted as the primary source of economic and social support for young people. We argue that four co-centric circles circumscribe the type of citizenship available to a young person and have implications for young people's acquisition of full citizenship and financial independence: (a) the family, (b) friends and acquaintances, (c) changes in the labour market and (d) opportunities offered to the young unemployed through passive (benefits, social assistance) and active (vocational training) labour market policies available. With regard to young peoples' ability to become financially independent, these either exercise a centrifugal force, encouraging dependency upon others (especially parents and close friends) for care, guidance and support, or a centripetal force, encouraging them to assume full rights and responsibilities of adulthood. youth, youth citizenship, Southern Europe, social policy, welfare, unemployment, employment...|$|E
40|$|Rural {{development}} has, {{in recent}} years, {{become a major}} area of EU policy, {{to the extent that}} the term has even begun to be overused in signifying a new shift in EU rural policy. The result has been a great deal of misunderstanding and numerous divergent interpretations of both the concept and the practice. Although rural development existed as a policy domain before the arrival of the accentuated ‘Second Pillar’ of the reformed Common Agricultural Policy, the fact is that an increasingly Europeanized approach to rural development funding, programming, and administration has developed in the post- 1999 period. In this paper we argue that the study of rural development policy will gain a great deal from using a policy network approach to interpret the dynamics of evolving rural development policy within member states. Our main aim is to analyze and interpret the newly emerging Rural Development Policy Network in Greece, which aspires to separate itself from a strong and resistant Agricultural Policy Network. The example of Greece suits the purpose of the paper not only because of Greece’s continuing reliance on agriculture and the centrality of the latter in sustaining rural livelihoods, but most importantly due to the institutional arrangements developed around it, which are characterized by a prevalence of agricultural interests at the expense of wider rural concerns. The concern of this paper is with the mechanisms of transition, and to a lesser extent with its outcome. One major finding is that the policy network approach to the study of rural development policy in Greece brings to light a certain transformation in policy structures, mechanisms, and administration. This transformation is not so evident at the level of policy style and/or policy outcome. Due to it having been labeled a ‘laggard’ <b>member</b> <b>state,</b> <b>Greece</b> has been affected by the Europeanization of rural development policy and has to some extent transformed its policy- making procedures accordingly. At the same time, the process of Europeanization has acted to empower civil society mechanisms and actors. ...|$|E

Similarly, the word ‘austerity’ came, in many counties, to describe the package of taxation increases, expenditures reductions and other economic reforms required as part of a Troika support programme. The rights and wrongs of debt fuelled growth and bank bailouts packages shaped political discourse not just in <b>member</b> <b>states</b> seeking sovereign external support but also placed great strain on the European project and raised real questions about the very future of the eurozone.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is the consideration of the cultural heritage policies of European institutions (the European Union and the Council of Europe) and the impact of such policies on the national heritage policy of two <b>member</b> <b>States</b> (<b>Greece</b> and Italy). The analysis focuses mainly on the national and supra-national heritage legislation. The EU by means of policies and laws has gradually emerged as an important factor in the field of national heritage management. The impact of the EU in the fields of heritage terminology and legislation is a fact. New concepts concerning things 'national' are being directly 'imported' from the EU to its <b>member</b> <b>States.</b> The use of heritage in the political arena has a long history in nation States, with regard to issues of identity. By taking this one step further, the EU aims to construct a 'European' identity which will eventually replace the different 'national' ones. A historical narrative proves the logic behind EU action. The cultural heritage has been used by the EU throughout the years for a variety of political and economic purposes. The amendment of national laws and the introduction of EU concepts into national heritage law are results of an imposed change, not of legal evolution. The comparison of the two EU <b>member</b> <b>States</b> emphasises the complexity of issues involved in both the national and supra¬national level. The conclusions aspire to arouse awareness of the powers that EU enjoys over national heritage legislation. The thesis also endeavours to highlight the power of law to create and construct public attitude towards the heritage, enhancing or denying claims for identity. It assesses the political will behind legal acts and policies with regard to the heritage. It addresses the attempt made by European institutions to create 'uniformity' in both laws and concepts related to heritage in a Europe of diverse heritages...|$|R

National remedies for bidders have been harmonised by two EC directives. The study considers {{the extent to which}} a system of bidder remedies is an effective mechanism for enforcing the procurement rules, through text-based research of the public sector procurement remedies and an empirical study in the construction sector, based on interviews with bidders, awarding authorities and procurement lawyers, in two <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> <b>Greece</b> and the United Kingdom. The findings of the research indicate that remedies are not in principle incapable of assisting enforcement but that the use that is made of them and their capacity to enforce the law depend on their features, in terms, particularly, of legal costs as well as of the likelihood of a case being won at trial. Before this project was undertaken, there was no empirical research work on procurement remedies. It is hoped that this study will interest everyone involved in contracts awards (namely, firms, public bodies and lawyers) as well as scholars of EC law studying the national {{enforcement of}} EC rules, either in the area of procurement or in other areas regulated by EC law.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with examining the meaning of different forms of work found within the EU. Despite the increasing acknowledgement {{of the importance of}} the diversity of work forms within Europe, both within the Commission and the European academic literature, it is argued that existing formulations are highly problematic. Existing research, both academic and policy-related, is shown to be characterized by a bewildering terminology, which is often used interchangeably, and which works to reinscribe existing lines of power within the EU. Moreover, this work is shown to be theoretically problematic. The centrality of distinct measurable categories to representations of the diversity of contemporary work within the EU is argued to be a way of thinking which constructs difference in terms of statistical differences, which encourages homogenizing and oppositional representations of North and South, and which also facilitates thinking as the same that which may be very different. Correspondingly, we argue for an alternative analysis of the diversity of work forms, one which is grounded in the different meanings these forms assume in different cultural contexts. Taking three categories of 'atypical' work (part-time, self-employed and undeclared) in three EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (<b>Greece,</b> Denmark and the UK), the paper proceeds by demonstrating how categories which are constructed as same/different statistically are rather more complicated when considered in terms of the meanings invested in them. The categories of work are argued to be contextually and culturally embedded; they are inscribed with and reconstituted through culturally specific sets of meanings in each of the three <b>member</b> <b>states</b> under consideration. We conclude the paper by reflecting on the possibilities opened up by this kind of analysis, its implications regarding debates over European labour markets, and its positioning with respect to debates over the relationship between the cultural and the economic...|$|R

40|$|Introduction]. In recent years, {{the area}} of Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) has become a top {{priority}} on the EU agenda. Even at a glance, one is struck by {{the speed with which}} policy issues within this broad policy area, which were usually seen as the last remaining preserve of the individual <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> are increasingly perceived and identified as European-wide policy concerns. In particular, this research paper focuses the analysis on the political negotiations for the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) framework decision. The fine balance between security, freedom and justice in the newly enlarging Europe is being rigorously tested in the current pervasive climate of fear, which is fuelled by the "global threats" of terrorism and cross-border crime. The negotiations for the European Arrest Warrant provide an excellent example of how these contrasting pressures can play out within the arena of EU policy making. In {{the first part of this}} paper, the historical context for the emergence of the European Arrest Warrant negotiations is presented. The next section presents the analytical approach used in this research, which involved the application and comparison of different explanations or models of policy making. Since the 1980 s, several models of collective decision making have been developed that provide far reaching insights into the dynamics of decision making processes (for example Bueno de Mesquita et al 1985, Stokman and Van Oosten 1994). The main differences between the models concern the assumptions they make regarding the behaviour of the actors involved in the decision-making process. On the basis of the accuracy of the models’ forecasts of decision outcomes, we can make inferences about the relevance of the influence strategies posited. The empirical research first examined the policy preparatory stage at the national level and in particular focused on three small <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> <b>Greece,</b> Ireland and Finland. This research illustrates the strong cross-national differences that exist with regard to the level of centralisation, as well as the level of transparency, which characterises the processes of EU policy preparation in the JHA arena in each country. Following this, the analysis focused on the decision-making phase at the European level for the European Arrest Warrant. The application of the modelling approach allows an insight into the kind of bargaining across issues, as well as the likely gains and losses incurred by the <b>member</b> <b>states</b> involved in these negotiations...|$|R
