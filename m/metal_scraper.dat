25|$|At first, Merengue Típico Cibaeño (traditional Cibanian merengue) {{was played}} on {{stringed}} instruments like the tres and cuatro, but when Germans {{came to the}} island in the late 19th century trading their instruments for tobacco, the accordion quickly replaced the strings as lead instrument. Típico groups play a variety of rhythms, but most common are the merengue and the pambiche. In the 1930s–50s a bass instrument was also often used. Called marimba, it resembles the Cuban marímbula, and is a large box-shaped thumb piano with 3-6 metal keys. The main percussion instruments, güira and tambora, {{have been a part}} of the ensemble since the music's inception, and are so important that they are often considered symbolic of the whole country. The güira is a <b>metal</b> <b>scraper</b> believed to be of native Taíno origin, while the tambora is a two-headed drum of African origin. Together with the European accordion, the típico group symbolizes the three cultures that combined to make today's Dominican Republic.|$|E

50|$|The guayo or ralladera is a <b>metal</b> <b>scraper</b> {{used as a}} {{percussion}} {{instrument in}} traditional styles of Cuban music such as changüí, predecessor of son cubano. Largely replaced by the güiro (gourd scraper) during the 20th century, the guayo is now rare. In the Dominican Republic, the güira, a similar <b>metal</b> <b>scraper</b> used in merengue, is sometimes called guayo. In contrast to Cuba, güiras replaced güiros in the early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Chrome {{surfaces}} can {{be damaged}} by cleaning with abrasives and sharp/hardened metal utensils common in commercial cooking environments, so special spatulas, brushes and cleansers are recommended {{for the operation}} and maintenance of these products. If damage does occur to the chrome surface, food acids tend to penetrate and dissolve the metal substrate beneath the chrome coating, causing it to spall off. Chrome griddles can be cleaned with soapy water and a palmetto bristle brush. <b>Metal</b> <b>scrapers</b> and abrasives should be explicitly avoided, as they tend to damage the surface and permanently cloud the mirror finish. Special cleaning agents and powders specifically for use on chrome surfaces are also available.|$|R
50|$|Palo {{music is}} played on long drums termed palos.The word palos means trees, and {{therefore}} all Dominican palos drums are instruments made from hollowed out logs. The {{head of the}} drum is made of cowhide and it {{is attached to the}} log portion with hoops and pegs in the Eastern region, or with nails in the Southwest. There is a master drum (palo mayor) which is the large, wide drum played with slimmer drums (alcahuetes) alongside: two in the East or three elsewhere. Palos are usually played with guiras, which are <b>metal</b> <b>scrapers.</b> They may also be played with maracas, or a little stick used to hit the master drum, called the catá. The Dominican region in which the palos are played determines the form, the number of the instruments, and how they are played.|$|R
5000|$|The güira (...) is a <b>metal</b> <b>scraper</b> {{from the}} Dominican Republic {{used as a}} {{percussion}} instrument in cumbia and merengue, to a lesser extent, other genres such as bachata. It is made of a metal sheet (commonly steel, sometimes from a five-gallon oil can) and played with a stiff brush, thus being similar to the Cuban guayo (also a <b>metal</b> <b>scraper)</b> and the güiro (a gourd scraper). Güira, guayo and güiro all have a function akin {{to that of the}} maracas or the trap-kit's hi-hat, namely providing a complementary beat.|$|E
50|$|The reco-reco (also {{called the}} raspador, caracaxá or querequexé) is a <b>metal</b> <b>scraper</b> {{used as a}} {{percussion}} instrument in Brazilian music.

50|$|An ink eraser is an {{instrument}} used to remove ink from a writing surface, {{more difficult than}} removing pencil markings. Older types are a <b>metal</b> <b>scraper,</b> which scrapes the ink off the surface, and an eraser similar to a rubber pencil eraser, but with additional abrasives, such as sand, incorporated. Fibreglass erasers also work by abrasion. These erasers physically remove the ink from the paper. There is some unavoidable damage with most types of paper and ink, where the paper absorbs some ink.|$|E

5000|$|Merengue típico is {{the oldest}} style of merengue still {{performed}} today (usually in the Dominican Republic and the United States), its origins {{dating back to the}} 1850s. It originated in the rural city of Navarrete (villa bisono), northern valley region around the city of Santiago called the Cibao, resulting in the term [...] "merengue cibaeño". Originally played on the <b>metal</b> <b>scraper</b> called güira, the Tambora, and a stringed instrument (usually a guitar or a variant such as the tres). Stringed instruments were replaced with two-row diatonic button accordions when Germans began to travel to the island in the 1880s as part of the tobacco trade. Later, the marimbula, a bass lamellophone related to the African mbira, was added to fill out the sound ...|$|E
50|$|A grindometer is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} the {{particle}} size of suspensions, typically inks such as those used in printing, or paints. It consists of a steel block with a channel of varying depth machined into it, starting at a convenient depth for the type of suspension to be measured, and becoming shallower until it ends flush with the block's surface. The depth of the groove is marked off on a graduated scale next to it. The suspension to be tested is poured into the deep end of the groove, and scraped towards the shallow end with a flat <b>metal</b> <b>scraper.</b> At the point where the depth of the groove equals the largest particles in the suspension, irregularities (for example pinholes in an ink sample) will become visible.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} this style of music, {{it is important to}} look at the genres that influenced this new style, most importantly merengue. Merengue is the national music and dance of the Dominican Republic. It is in a fast 2/4 beat that has African, Creole, and European origins that emerged during the early 20th Century. Merengue music has varying styles and a very distinct rhythm, which makes it distinct from any other particular genre of music. [...] During its beginnings it included call-and-response vocals, a Spanish guitar, and a box lamellophone called the Congolese marimbula. These instruments were replaced with the acoustic guitar, bass, German accordion, the tambora (a West African two headed drum), and a güira, which is a <b>metal</b> <b>scraper.</b> In the 1930s, Merengue became modernized and became the national symbol of the Dominican Republic. Orchestras played for the middle class and social elite dancehall. The sound became that of a more generic Latin band. This included instrument replacement for the piano, staple percussion and bass. The merengue in which merenhouse is based upon developed in the 1980s and 1990s, and resulted from Juan Luis Guerra’s incorporation of more modern sounding arrangements and socially relevant themes. He was also influenced by pop and jazz music.|$|E
50|$|Merengue is {{a musical}} genre {{native to the}} Dominican Republic. It has a {{moderate}} to very fast 2/4 rhythm played on güira (<b>metal</b> <b>scraper)</b> and the double-headed tambora. The accordion is also common. Traditional, accordion-based merengue is usually termed merengue típico and is still played by living accordionists like Francisco Ulloa, Fefita la Grande, El Ciego de Nagua, and Rafaelito Román. More modern merengues incorporate electric instruments and influences from salsa, and rock and roll. Choruses are often sung in a call and response form by two or three back-up singers, or more traditionally, by the musicians playing tambora or güira. Beginning in the 1960s, dancing {{became a part of}} the singers' work with Johnny Ventura's Combo Show format, and is now a staple of many of the genre's biggest stars. Lyrically, irony and double entendres are common Merengue continued to be limited in popularity to the lower classes, especially in the Cibao area, in the early 20th century. Artists like Juan F. García, Juan Espínola and Julio Alberto Hernández tried to move merengue into the mainstream, but failed, largely due to social prejudices. Some success occurred after nationalistic feelings arose among the Cibao elite who resented the U.S. occupation of the country from 1916-1924. Legend has it that at this time the faster (merengue típico cibaeño) was slowed down to accommodate American soldiers who couldn't dance the difficult steps of the merengue; this mid-tempo version was called pambiche. Major mainstream acceptance started with Rafael Trujillo's rise to power in the early 1930s.|$|E

Together with the European accordion, the típico group symbolizes the three cultures that combined to make today's Dominican Republic. One important figure in early merengue was Francisco [...] "Ñico" [...] Lora (1880-1971), who is often credited for quickly popularizing the accordion at the turn of the 20th century. Lora was once asked how many merengues he had composed in his lifetime and he answered [...] "thousands", probably without much exaggeration, and many of these compositions are still a standard part of the típico repertoire. He was a skilled improviser who could compose songs on the spot, by request. But he has also been likened to a journalist, since in his precomposed songs [...] "he commented on everything with his accordion" [...] (Pichardo, in Austerlitz 1997:35). His compositions discussed current events such as Cuban independence, World War I, the arrival of the airplane, and US occupation of the Dominican Republic. Among Lora's contemporaries are Toño Abreu and Hipólito Martínez, best remembered for their merengue [...] "Caña Brava". This popular song was composed in 1928 or 1929 as an advertisement for the Brugal rum company, who were then selling a rum of the same name. Brugal paid Martínez $5 for his efforts.|$|E
40|$|A {{dissertation}} on Promoting metal scrapers collection and sales in Kinondoni for income poverty reduction by Formalization {{is a result}} of the Community Needs Assessments (CNA) conducted at Tegeta in Kinondoni district. Prior to project intervention, the CNA exercise was conducted which came up with the community needs and problems. The main problem unveiled by the CNA exercise, which faces majority community members in Tegeta Village was the prevalence of income poverty. Among other activities Tegeta community members do, is the engagement in concrete production sand mining as their basic activities and fishing which contribute to their household income for income poverty reduction. However, under this study there were four objectives which set to facilitate solving the problem, these are: Sensitize 60 Tegeta community members on <b>metal</b> <b>scraper</b> collection and sales project by March 2016, Equip 30 community with knowledge and skills on how to manage and run Metal scrapers collection and sales project by March 2016. Now, the project planned to achieve four objectives namely: Three objectives have been achieved except one objective, which was to ensure reliable market, which will be met under the full operation of the project. Other activities have not been executed due to different factors including: The Government has no clear policy for <b>metal</b> <b>scraper</b> collection and sales so some licenses are on process...|$|E
