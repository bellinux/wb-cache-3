25|$|VLC {{media player}} can play high {{definition}} recordings of D-VHS tapes duplicated {{to a computer}} using CapDVHS.exe. This offers another way to archive all D-VHS tapes with the DRM copy freely tag. Using a FireWire connection from cable boxes to computers, VLC can stream live, unencrypted content to a monitor or HDTV. VLC media player can display the playing video as the desktop wallpaper, like Windows DreamScene, by using DirectX, only available on Windows operating systems. VLC media player can create screencasts and record the desktop. On Microsoft Windows, VLC also supports the Direct <b>Media</b> <b>Object</b> (DMO) framework and can thus make use of some third-party DLLs (Dynamic-link library). On most platforms, VLC can tune into and view DVB-C, DVB-T, and DVB-S channels. On macOS the separate EyeTV plugin is required, on Windows it requires the card's BDA Drivers.|$|E
50|$|OMA DRM version 1.0 {{was first}} drafted in November 2002, and {{approved}} in June 2004. It provides basic Digital Rights Management, without strong protection. The standard specifies three main methods: Forward Lock, Combined Delivery (combined rights object / <b>media</b> <b>object),</b> and Separate Delivery (separated rights object + encrypted <b>media</b> <b>object).</b> Forward Lock prevents the user from forwarding content such as ringtones and wallpapers on their phone.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{business}} model to support media content personalisation: an agent-based business-to-business (B 2 B) brokerage platform for media content producer and distributor businesses. Distributors aim to pro-vide viewers with a personalised content experience and producers wish to en-sure that their <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> are watched {{by as many}} targeted viewers as possi-ble. In this scenario viewers and <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> (main programmes and candi-date objects for insertion) have profiles and, {{in the case of}} main programme ob-jects, are annotated with placeholders representing personalisation opportuni-ties, i. e., locations for insertion of personalised <b>media</b> <b>objects.</b> The MultiMedia Brokerage (MMB) platform is a multiagent multilayered brokerage composed by agents that act as sellers and buyers of viewer stream timeslots and/or <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> on behalf of the registered businesses. These agents engage in negotia-tions to select the <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> that best match the current programme and viewer profiles...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} work we have described a multimedia system, MAVIS 2, supporting content and concept based retrieval and navigation. A central {{component of the}} system is a multimedia thesaurus in which media content is associated with appropriate concepts in a semantic layer. A major challenge is identifying and constructing these associations in a particular application without requiring a huge amount of manual effort. In this paper we propose a two phase approach to the problem. In the first phase, latent semantic analysis is used to associate metadata available for some <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> with concept class descriptions. This facilitates automatic associations to be made with the concept layer for those <b>media</b> <b>objects.</b> In the second phase, media content matching is used to classify <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> without metadata through their similarity to <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> classified in phase 1...|$|R
40|$|Structuring <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> such as text, {{graphics}} etc. {{by means}} of XML is a broadly discussed issue in hypermedia modeling. Thereby, an entire hypermedia document is not only arranged {{in such a way}} different developers may interchange data and have easy access to the inner structure of <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> {{by means of}} powerful tools available in the XML scene. Moreover, utilizing a given document structure to find new possibilities of linking documents is a major concern. Formal approaches, however, rarely appear in this context. In this paper, we contribute to formally structuring <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> and their linkage, thereby aiming at analyzing hyperlink structures. That is, properties of hyperlinks between <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> underlie a mathematical verification in advance of encoding the concrete hyperdocument. Algebraic specifications serve as a formal model allowing to obtain algebras reflecting hyperlink structures open to analysis...|$|R

40|$|Recommending <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> {{to users}} {{typically}} requires users to rate existing <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> {{so as to}} understand their preferences. The number of ratings required to produce good suggestions can be reduced through collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is more difficult when prior users have not rated {{the same set of}} <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> as the current user or each other. In this work, we describe an approach to applying prior user data {{in a way that does}} not require users to rate the same <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> and that does not require imputation (estimation) of prior user ratings of objects they have not rated. This approach is applied to the problem of finding good equalizer settings for music audio and is shown to greatly reduce the number of ratings the current user must make to find a good equalization setting...|$|R

40|$|We study caching {{strategies}} for proxies that cache VBR encoded continuous <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> for highly interactive streaming applications. First, we develop {{a model for}} streaming VBR encoded continuous <b>media</b> <b>objects.</b> This model forms {{the basis for a}} stream admission control criterion and our study of caching strategies. We find that unlike conventional web caches, proxy caches for continuous <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> need to replicate or stripe objects to achieve high hit rates. We develop novel caching strategies that either implicitly or explicitly track the request pattern and cache (and replicate) objects accordingly. Our numerical results indicate that our caching strategies achieve significantly higher hit rates than caching without object replication...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{the idea}} of media {{contents}} streaming through the Internet has become a very important issue. On the other hand, full caching for <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> is not a practical solution and leads to consume the cache storage in keeping few <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> because of its limited capacity. Furthermore, repeated traffic which is being sent to clients wastes the network bandwidth. Thus, utilizing the bandwidth of the network is considered as an important objective for network administrators. <b>Media</b> <b>objects</b> have some characteristics {{that have to be}} considered when a caching algorithm is going to be performed. In this paper, recent approaches that have been proposed for media streams caching in peer-to-peer systems are reviewed...|$|R

40|$|Although {{multimedia}} {{objects such}} as images, audios and texts are of different modalities, {{there are a great}} amount of semantic correlations among them. In this paper, we propose a method of transductive learning to mine the semantic correlations among <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> of different modalities so that to achieve the cross-media retrieval. Cross-media retrieval is a new kind of searching technology by which the query examples and the returned results can be of different modalities, e. g., to query images by an example of audio. First, according to the <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> features and their co-existence information, we construct a uniform cross-media correlation graph, in which <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> of different modalities are represented uniformly. To perform the cross-media retrieval, a positive score is assigned to the query example; the score spreads along the graph and <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> of target modality or MMDs with the highest scores are returned. To boost the retrieval performance, we also propose different approaches of long-term and short-term relevance feedback to mine the information contained in the positive and negative examples...|$|R

We will develop a Dynamic Web Markup Language (DWML) as a software platform for authoring animated web pages with character agents. We assume that both primary <b>media</b> <b>objects</b> (text, image, etc.) and animated characters can be dynamic objects carrying time-based information, and that a character agent is a special dynamic medium {{as part of a}} multimedia interface.
