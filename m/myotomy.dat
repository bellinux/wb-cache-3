50|$|The {{shortcoming}} of laparoscopic esophageal <b>myotomy</b> is {{the need}} for a fundoplication. On the one hand, the <b>myotomy</b> opens the esophagus, while on the other hand, the fundoplication causes an obstruction. Recent understanding of the gastroesophageal antireflux barrier/valve has shed light on the reason for the occurrence of reflux following <b>myotomy.</b> The gastroesophageal valve is the result of infolding of the esophagus into the stomach at the esophageal hiatus. This infolding creates a valve which extends from 7 o'clock to 4 o'clock (270 degrees) around the circumference of the esophagus. Laparoscopic <b>myotomy</b> cuts the muscle at the 12 o'clock position, resulting in incompetence of the valve and reflux. Recent robotic laparoscopic series have attempted a <b>myotomy</b> at the 5 o'clock position on the esophagus away from the valve. The robotic lateral esophageal <b>myotomy</b> preserves the esophageal valve and does not result in reflux, thereby obviating the need for a fundoplication. The robotic lateral esophageal <b>myotomy</b> has had the best results to date in terms of ability to eat without reflux.|$|E

40|$|Morphological {{characters}} {{have historically been}} {{used as the basis}} for mammalian taxonomic designations and, in a geographic context, subspecies descriptions. Geographic genetic structuring of a species, however, often reflects a contrasting classification for sampled populations. To investigate morphological and genetic congruence, geometric morphometrics and phylogeographic mitochondrial DNA sequence analyses of a South African plains-dwelling species, <b>Myotomys</b> unisulcatus, the Karoo bush rat, was performed across its range. A Bayesian population structure analysis identified two closely-related distinct genetic assemblages: the first contains populations from both the eastern, southern, and western parts of the species range (coastal lowland group), and the second comprises individuals from the Little Karoo (central interior group). Areas of sharp elevation (the Great Escarpment), coupled to vegetational differences, appeared to be the main factor limiting gene flow between these two groups. Geometric morphometric analyses on the ventral and dorsal views of the crania of M. unisulcatus failed to support the genetic groupings. Instead environmental factors in the respective biomes appeared to play a more important role in shaping the crania of both genders. The contrasting patterns obtained between morphology and genetics in M. unisulcatus is probably indicative of phenotypic plasticity throughout the range of the species, and it is hypothesized that regional environmental factors play a prominent role in explaining geographic morphological variation within the species. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.

40|$|ArticleThe {{evolution}} of the southern African faunal assemblages {{is thought to have}} been largely influenced by climatic oscillations of the Plio-Pleistocene. These fluctuations presumably had a major impact in the form of vicariant diversification of taxa by causing simultaneous speciation/cladogenetic events due to habitat fragmentation. We aimed to test this hypothesis by comparing the timing of diversification observed for several rodent lineages with three peaks of aridification described at approximately 2. 8, 1. 7 and 1. 0. Mya. Our study included nine rodent taxa (. Nannomys,. Aethomys,. Otomys,. <b>Myotomys,.</b> Rhabdomys and. Mastomys for the Muridae,. Saccostomus for the Nesomyidae,. Cryptomys for the Bathyergidae, and. Xerus for the Sciuridae) that showed intrageneric mitochondrial cytochrome b cladogenesis during the last 5. Ma. Phylogenetic analysis performed with maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods supported the monophyly of all subgenera and genera. Most diversifications are also well supported and in agreement with previously published studies. Divergence dates between lineages were estimated using a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock and the 7. Myr split between different. Apodemus species as well as the divergence between. Tatera and. Gerbillurus at 6. 3. Myr were used as calibration points. Our results did not provide any convincing evidence of a correspondence between rodent diversification events and peaks in aridity during the Plio-Pleistocene. The nearly perfect linear correlation between cladogenesis and time, during the last 5. Myr, strongly suggests that the diversification of southern African rodent lineages is driven by complex interactions between different factors, including life history, climatic changes, and topographic barriers. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether or not a true primary repair, without <b>myotomies</b> and with the gastroesophageal junction below the diaphragm, can be accomplished across the esophageal atresia (EA) spectrum. Our hypothesis is that the esophageal anastomosis can withstand significant tension. The consequences, particularly for those patients with a very long gap atresia, were assessed. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Difficulties arise roughly in proportion {{to the size of the}} gap between esophageal segments. Reported surgical complications remain frequent, and particularly at the far end of the EA spectrum, not all children are left with a satisfactorily functioning esophagus or esophageal substitute. METHODS: The outcomes of all infants who had a true primary repair of EA from 1976 - 1997 were determined. Surgically, the methods used to achieve a reliable true primary repair were expanded to accomplish this, even for a very long gap EA. RESULTS: From 1976 - 97, 70 infants with or without associated tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) had primary repairs performed with no surgery-related deaths and 11 % later deaths. No interpositions were performed since 1983. There were no discernible anastomotic leaks and one late recurrent TEF related to the early use of balloon dilation. Ten infants had gaps of 5. 0 - 6. 8 cm and, among these, four had gaps of 5. 5 - 6. 8 cm that could not be pulled together initially. Traction sutures in the esophageal ends, however, produced sufficient lengthening within 6 - 10 days for a true primary repair. Very long gap repairs produced more reflux (10 of 10 required a fundoplication versus 24 of 70 overall) and more dilations to relieve strictures. Two infants underwent stricture resection with no recurrence. On follow-up, all patients over 2 years of age were eating well or satisfactorily, and none had a gastrostomy tube. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The esophageal anastomosis can withstand considerable tension and allows a reliable true primary repair for the full EA spectrum. (2) Growth is rapid and traction sutures will produce significant esophageal lengthening within days. (3) With increasing tension, gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and strictures are more common; however, both are treatable. Follow-up reveals the benefits of true primary repair over other solutions...|$|R
