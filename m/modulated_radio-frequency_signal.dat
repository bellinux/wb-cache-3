40|$|Sensors for Harsh Environments III, Boston, MA, 11 - 12 September 2007 Intensity-modulated fiber-optic sensors {{have many}} {{advantages}} including simplicity and potential low cost. The developments of several intensity-modulated fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor systems are introduced in this paper. These include a displacement sensor, a tilt sensor (both based on chirped FBGs), and a dual-FBG based sensor which can measure lots of parameters such as strain. For the chirped FBG based sensors, the measurands {{are related to}} reflection optical powers of the sensing FBGs by changing their chirp rates (or reflection bandwidths) which are insensitive to temperature. While the dual-FBG based sensor is based on electrical beating of <b>modulated</b> <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) <b>signals</b> reflected from the two FBGs, which act as the sensing element and reference respectively. The power of the RF beating signal depends on the wavelength separation of the two FBGs. By monitoring the RF signal power, intensity-modulated FBG sensing with the sensitivity depending on the modulation frequency of the light source is realized while the temperature effect is compensated by the reference FBG. Experimental measurement of strain, displacement and tilt angle are implemented and good results are achieved. Department of Electrical EngineeringInvited conference pape...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the use of}} bandpass continuous-time ΣΔ modulators with widely programmable notch frequency for {{the efficient}} digitization of <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>signals</b> {{in the next generation}} of software-defined-radio mobile systems. The modulator architectures under study are based on a fourth-order loop filter - implemented with two LC-based resonators - and a finite-impulsive-response feedback loop in order to increase their flexibility and degrees of freedom. Several topologies are studied, considering three different cases for the embedded digital-to-analog converter, namely: return-to-zero, non-return-to-zero and raised-cosine waveform. In all cases, a notch-aware synthesis methodology is presented, which takes into account the dependency of the loop-filter coefficients on the notch frequency and compensates for the dynamic range degradation due to the variation of the notch. The synthesized modulators are compared in terms of their sensitivity to main circuit error mechanisms and the estimated power consumption over a notch-frequency tuning range of 0. 1 fs to 0. 4 fs. Time-domain behavioral and macromodel electrical simulations validate this approach, demonstrating the feasibility of the presented methodology and architectures for the efficient and robust digitization of <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>signals</b> with a scalable resolution and programmable signal bandwidth.
