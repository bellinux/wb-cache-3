5|$|A Link Between Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from A Link to the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for A Link Between Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's <b>milk</b> <b>bar.</b> He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from A Link to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for A Link Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E

50|$|In early 2010 <b>milk</b> <b>bars</b> {{were seen}} {{to make a}} comeback.

500|$|Limp Bizkit {{developed}} a cult {{following in the}} underground music scene, particularly at the <b>Milk</b> <b>Bar,</b> an underground punk club in Jacksonville. The band's local popularity was such that Sugar Ray, who had a major label contract, opened for a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit at Velocity with hip hop group Funkdoobiest. Milkbar owner, Danny Wimmer, stated that Limp Bizkit [...] "had the biggest draw for a local band. They went from playing [...] ten people to eight hundred within months. Fred [...] was always marketing the band. He would go to record stores and get people involved, he was in touch with high schools." [...] However, the band knew that to achieve national success, {{they would have to}} distinguish themselves in their live performances. Attracting crowds by word of mouth, the band gave energetic live performances, covering George Michael's [...] "Faith" [...] and Paula Abdul's [...] "Straight Up", and featuring Borland in bizarre costumes. Borland's theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees.|$|E

Sometimes <b>milk</b> <b>bars</b> occupied a section of a larger cafeteria in a department store or 'coffee palace' but were more pften an independent business in a busy street. They were differentiated from tea shops by their style and materials as well as by their equipment, food, drinks and service. In addition to their introduction of a popular new design language of streamlined moderne, certain <b>milk</b> <b>bars</b> in the metropolitan centres introduced the public to more uncompromisingly modernish design...|$|R

2500|$|The novella {{begins with}} the droogs sitting in their {{favourite}} hangout, the Korova <b>Milk</b> <b>Bar,</b> and drinking [...] "milk-plus" [...] — a beverage consisting of milk laced with the customer's drug of choice — {{to prepare for a}} night of mayhem. They assault a scholar walking home from the public library; rob a store, leaving the owner and his wife bloodied and unconscious; beat up a beggar; then scuffle with a rival gang. Joyriding through the countryside in a stolen car, they break into an isolated cottage and terrorise the young couple living there, beating the husband and raping his wife. In a metafictional touch, the husband is a writer working on a manuscript called [...] "A Clockwork Orange", and Alex contemptuously reads out a paragraph that states the novel's main theme before shredding the manuscript. Back at the Korova, Alex strikes Dim for his crude response to a woman's singing of an operatic passage, and strains within the gang become apparent. At home in his parents' futuristic flat, Alex plays classical music at top volume, which he describes as giving him orgasmic bliss before falling asleep.|$|E
