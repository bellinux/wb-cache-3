25|$|Heart rate reserve (HRreserve) is the {{difference}} between a person's measured or predicted <b>maximum</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and resting heart rate. Some methods of measurement of exercise intensity measure percentage of heart rate reserve. Additionally, as a person increases their cardiovascular fitness, their HRrest will drop, and the heart rate reserve will increase. Percentage of HRreserve is equivalent to percentage of VO2 reserve.|$|E

25|$|The <b>maximum</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> (HRmax) is {{the highest}} heart rate an {{individual}} can achieve without severe problems through exercise stress, and generally decreases with age. Since HRmax varies by individual, the most accurate way of measuring any single person's HRmax is via a cardiac stress test. In this test, a person is subjected to controlled physiologic stress (generally by treadmill) while being monitored by an ECG. The intensity of exercise is periodically increased until certain changes in heart function are detected on the ECG monitor, {{at which point the}} subject is directed to stop. Typical duration of the test ranges ten to twenty minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Adults who are {{beginning}} a new exercise regimen are often advised to perform this test {{only in the}} presence of medical staff due to risks associated with high heart rates. For general purposes, a formula is often employed to estimate a person's <b>maximum</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> However, these predictive formulas have been criticized as inaccurate because they generalized population-averages and usually focus on a person's age.

(see Limitations of Estimation Formulas).|$|E
2500|$|A stress echocardiogram, {{also known}} as a stress echo, uses {{ultrasound}} imaging of the heart to assess the wall motion in response to physical stress. First, images of the heart are taken [...] "at rest" [...] to acquire a baseline of the patient's wall motion at a resting heart rate. The patient then walks on a treadmill or uses another exercise modality to increase the heart rate to his or her target heart rate, or 85% of the age-predicted <b>maximum</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> (220 − patient's age). Finally, images of the heart are taken [...] "at stress" [...] to assess wall motion at the peak heart rate. A stress echo assesses wall motion of the heart; it does not, however, create an image of the coronary arteries directly. Ischemia of one or more coronary arteries could cause a wall motion abnormality which could indicate coronary artery disease. The gold standard test to directly create an image of the coronary arteries and directly assess for stenosis or occlusion is a cardiac catheterization. A stress echo is not invasive and is performed {{in the presence of a}} licensed medical professional, such as a cardiologist, and a cardiac sonographer.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to assess changes in resting and <b>maximum</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> as primary {{indicators}} of cardiac autonomic function in metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients {{and to determine}} their value for discriminating MetS from non-MetS. 468 participants were enrolled in this cross-sectional study and assessed according to the updated adult treatment panel III (ATP-III) definition of MetS. Resting and <b>maximum</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> were recorded following the Bruce protocol during an exercise. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to identify the best cutoff point for discriminating MetS from the non-MetS state. 194 participants (41. 5 %) were diagnosed as MetS. The mean resting <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> (RHR) was not statistically different {{between the two groups}} (P = 0. 078). However, the mean <b>maximum</b> <b>heart</b> (MHR) <b>rate</b> was considerably higher in participants with MetS (142. 37 ± 14. 84 beats per min) compared to the non-MetS group (134. 62 ± 21. 63 beats per min) (P < 0. 001). In the MetS group, the MHR was positively correlated with the serum triglyceride level (β = 0. 185, P = 0. 033) and was inversely associated with age (β =- 0. 469, P < 0. 001). The MHR had a moderate value for discriminating MetS from the non-MetS state (c = 0. 580, P = 0. 004) with the optimal cutoff point of 140 beats per min. In MetS patients, the MHR was significantly greater compared to non-MetS subjects and was directly correlated with serum triglyceride levels and inversely with advanced age.

2500|$|Vespa {{amino acid}} mixture is a {{nutritional}} supplement consisting of larval saliva sold {{with the intent}} of improving endurance during exercise. Several companies in Asia and Europe have begun to manufacture dietary supplements and energy drinks which contain synthetic versions of secretions of the larvae of V. mandarinia, which the adult hornets usually consume. The manufacturers of these products make claims that consuming the larval hornet secretions (marketed as [...] "hornet juice") will enhance human endurance because of the effect it has on adult hornets' performance. During laboratory testing on mice, increased lipolysis (metabolism of fat) was observed in rat adipocytes (fat cells) alongside improved swimming endurance, decreased lactate, and increased glucose concentration in the blood stream. While testing on mice has produced optimistic outcomes, trial tests on humans were inconclusive. Ten trained cyclists were given either an 80 ml serving of the mixture or a sports-drink placebo. Variables tested included the time to complete the 20km race, peak power, average power, <b>maximum</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> and average heart rate.

40|$|Objective: [beta]-Adrenergic {{receptor}} antagonists {{are widely}} utilized {{for the management}} of cardiac diseases in dogs. We have recently identified two deletion polymorphisms in the canine adrenoreceptor 1 (ADRB 1) gene.

The objectives of this study were to predict the impact of these deletions on the predicted structure of the protein and on the <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> response to atenolol in a population of healthy adult dogs. Methods: Eighteen apparently healthy, mature dogs with (11) and without (seven) ADRB 1 deletions were evaluated. The <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> of the dogs was evaluated with a baseline ambulatory ECG before and 14 – 21 days after atenolol therapy (1 mg/kg orally q 12 h).

The <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> of the dogs with deletions were lower than those of the control dogs (the average <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> were significantly lower).
