Chronic renal injury induced by tacrolimus is characterized by linear fibrosis in the medullary rays; however, the early morphologic findings of acute tacrolimus nephrotoxicity are not well characterized. Kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM- 1) is a specific injury biomarker that has been proven to be useful in the diagnosis of mild to severe acute tubular injury on renal biopsies. This study was motivated by a patient with acute kidney injury associated with elevated serum tacrolimus levels in whom KIM- 1 staining was present only in proximal tubules located in the <b>medullary</b> <b>rays</b> in the setting of otherwise normal light, immunofluorescent, and electron microscopy. We subsequently evaluated KIM- 1 expression in 45 protocol and 39 indicated renal transplant biopsies to determine whether higher serum levels of tacrolimus were associated with acute segment specific injury to the proximal tubule, as reflected by KIM- 1 staining in the proximal tubules of the cortical <b>medullary</b> <b>rays.</b> The data suggest that tacrolimus toxicity preferentially affects proximal tubules in <b>medullary</b> <b>rays</b> and that this targeted injury is a precursor lesion for the linear fibrosis seen in chronic tacrolimus toxicity...|$|R

The aims of this study were to assess the effect of preterm birth and the effect of antenatal glucocorticoid treatment on nephrogenesis. Preterm baboons, which were delivered at 125 days gestation and ventilated for up to 21 days postnatally, were compared with gestational controls. A cohort of preterm baboons that had been exposed to antenatal glucocorticoids were compared with unexposed preterm baboons. The number of glomerular generations was estimated using a <b>medullary</b> <b>ray</b> glomerular-counting method, and glomerular number was estimated using unbiased stereology. CD 31 and WT- 1 localization was examined using immunohistochemistry and VEGF was localized using in situ hybridization. The number of glomerular generations was not affected by preterm birth, and total glomerular numbers were within the normal range. Kidneys were significantly enlarged in preterm baboons with a significant decrease in glomerular density (number of glomeruli per gram of kidney) in the preterm kidney compared with gestational controls. Neonates exposed to antenatal steroids had an increased kidney-to-body weight ratio and also more developed glomeruli compared with unexposed controls. Abnormal glomeruli, with a cystic Bowman's space and shrunken glomerular tuft, were often present in the superficial renal cortex of both the steroid-exposed and unexposed preterm kidneys; steroid exposure had no significant effect on the proportion of abnormal glomeruli. The proportion of abnormal glomeruli in the preterm kidneys ranged from 0. 2 to 18 %. In conclusion, although nephrogenesis is ongoing in the extrauterine environment, our findings demonstrate that preterm birth, independent of steroid exposure, is associated with a high proportion of abnormal glomeruli in some, but not all neonatal kidneys. Whether final nephron endowment is affected in those kidneys exhibiting a high proportion of abnormal glomeruli is yet to be confirmed...|$|E
40|$|Development {{of human}} fetal kidney in obstructive uropathy: Correlations with {{ultrasonography}} and urine biochemistry. In utero urethral obstruction results in bilateral hydronephrosis and severe fetal and post-natal morbidity and mortality. Obstetrical management {{depends on the}} indirect evaluation of fetal renal function by ultrasonography and biochemical analysis. No direct evaluation of the severity and possible reversibility of renal lesions is available. In this paper we analyzed kidneys from 34 fetuses (14 to 37 gestational weeks) in which (1) isolated bilateral urinary tract obstruction had been detected in utero by sonography, and (2) the severity of sonographic and biochemical prognostic indicators led to the indication of termination of pregnancy or to perinatal death. Pure hydronephrosis was observed in two young fetuses [14 and 20 gestational weeks (GW) ] and was associated with regressive changes in two others. In contrast, {{a wide spectrum of}} dysplastic renal lesions was present in 30 fetuses and was classified into four subgroups according to the association of dysplasia, hypoplasia and cysts. They had the following characteristics in common: (1) premature cessation of nephrogenesis assessed by the <b>medullary</b> <b>ray</b> counting method; (2) early disappearance or myofibroblas-tic differentiation of metanephric blastema; (3) early increase in interstitial mesenchyme with widespread expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin by mesenchymal cells; (4) frequent absence of classical criteria of dysplasia (nests of cartilage were observed in only 5 fetuses); (5) an identification, based upon the detection of alpha-smooth muscle actin expression, of the muscular phenotype of mesenchymal cells encircling primitive ducts. In conclusion, (1) the value of prognostic markers in fetuses less than 20 GW should be reconsidered; (2) after 20 GW there is a good correlation between markers predicting poor prognosis and the severity of renal lesions; (3) hypoplasia with disappearance of blastema cells, dysplasia and early interstitial fibrosis are evidence of the irreversibility of renal lesions and preclude any possibility of new nephron formation; (4) these findings suggest that most surgical in utero procedures are performed when irreversible renal lesions have developed...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} results on the {{anatomical}} studies of the affected grown plants, with special reference to their rootlets, main roots and stems. F. asarium niveum which has entered the host plant {{at the top of}} the rootlet, soon invades the vascular tissue, and finally fills up the disintegrated stele with mycelia (Fig. r, A B.). When the pro j ection of the secondary roots from the diseased roots takes place, majority of them may be affected with the casual fungus at their steles, before their root tops pass through the cortex parenchyma of the mother roots (Fig. 2). In the case of these pathological changes happened in the majority of the rootlets 2 ̆ 7 of the host plant, it will be certain that the latter may wilt, when soil water content decreases to a certain point. When the grown plants are affe c t ed at some of their rootlets, none of them may become diseased, however the inoculated parts may be strongly affected. It is suggested that the root pressure supported by many other healthy rootlets may prevent the ascending stream from the diseased rootlets which scarecely have their own root pressure, and that the premature suberization of the exo- and endodermis and the tyloses formed within the affected vessels may hinder, for a while, the further invasion of the pathogen into the upper healthy reots. In main roots and stems of the affected grown plants, it is observed that the cortex parenchyma and the leptome disintegrate gradually and wither to flattened shapes with brown colour. The cells of the <b>medullary</b> <b>ray</b> and of pith parenchyma together with that of cambium at first become hypertrophied then disintegrate to form large hollows, in which yellowish resinlike substances are often observed. These pathological changes of these tissues are as a rule preceeded by that of hadrome. The affected hadrome shows no morphological change. The substances found in the vessels are such as, mycelia, tyloses (Fig. 3) and resinlike substances. None of these substances, however, are found to be the direct cause of the wilting. The tyloses, notwithstanding SLEETH 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 opinion, are observed to be the products from the living elements around the useless vessels, which have been damaged at some other places of the water conductive systems. The causal fungus which has intruded into the root tep and has invaded into the stele, soon gains its position in the vessel far from the infected portion by the aid of the migration of microconidia. y 2 ̆ 7 The mycelia of the new colony thus formed within the upper healthy vessels, may invade the living tissues around the vessels, intruding from the thinner membranes of the pitted vessels. Thus the bodered tissues of the vessels are affected successively and at last they may become hollow, being distintegrated their cell contents (Fig. 7, B; 8, B. c). In the case of watermelon, looking upon the construction of its water conductive tissues, it is clear that these vessels with hollow surrounding tissues may be impossible to act their function. If such pathologica l changes may be the case not only with a few vessels but also with the majority in a greater part of the vascular bundles, connecting with each other, it will be certain that the wilting of the affected plant may happen. It wil be worth to note that no suberization occurs around the diseased tissues in the affected grown plants, although this is the case at the beginning of the infection, and that the mycelia lodging in the tissues of the grown plants may intrude rather easily into the host cells piercing directly the cell walls at their weaker points, though in the case of the beginning of the disease, the mycelia grow up rather intercellulary (Fig. 4, 5, 6). These differences are considered to be mainly due to the poisoning effect upon the host tissues of a certain substance or substances 1) excreted from the mycelia growing vigorously in the tissues. 1) 根端又は其附近より侵人した Fusarium niveum は間もなく心柱内全組織を崩壞し, 菌絲を以て充滿するに至る。多くの幼根が斯の如く激しく侵さるる時は細根による根壓の現象は著しく減退するが故に, もしこの際土壤水分が一定度以下に減退する時は麥凋現象の發現となるのである。 2) 被害甚しからざる根より新側根が形成せらるる時は, 新根の多くは根端が未だ抽出しない内に母根内に於て感染するのである。 3) 被害を受けた莖又は地際の根に於ては, 最初その木質部に被害を見るのであるが, 組織はその形態に變化を來すことなく單に組織構成柔細胞の内容の崩壞を見るのみである。被害甚しきに至れば組織は乾燥し褐色を呈するに至る。被害組織内の導管内に存する異物としては, 菌絲, 樹脂樣物質及び填充體を擧げ得るが, これらは何れも導管の水分通導を阻碍する原因とはならないものであることを認めた。 4) 被害皮部柔組織及び靱皮部は次第に崩壞して褐色を呈し扁平となる。而して射出髓,髓及び形成層部は崩壞してついに空洞と化し, その内腔に樹脂樣物質の集積を見ることが稀でない。 5) 根の先端部より侵人したる病原菌は, ついに寄主の導管内に入り, かくて後 micoconidia の轉流によつて遠方に轉移し, かくて後導管の周壁を破つて周在組織を侵すのである。かくの如くしてついに導管周在組織は全くその形骸のみを殘すに至る結果, これによつて保護せられたる導管の水分通導機能は遂行不可能の状態に隔る筈である。これらの病變が單に一個又は少數の導管に於て發生するに止まらず, 一定數以上の維管束に於て且つ相互に略相連絡して起る時は即ち麥凋現象の發現となるのである...|$|E

The aim of {{the present}} study was to determine the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a non-invasive measure of kidney volume in vivo in diabetic and non-diabetic rats. Magnetic resonance, T 1 weighted Spin Echo, images were obtained after injection of contrast in anesthetized control (N = 14) and hyperglycemic streptozotocin (STZ) -diabetic rats (N = 14). On MRI imaging the total kidney, cortex, medullary and pelvic volumes were calculated. Immediately after MRI measurements the left kidneys were removed before weighing either as a clamped kidney weight (that is, the kidney containing blood and urine) or as a wet kidney weight (the kidney drained of blood and urine), while the right kidneys were perfusion-fixed for morphometric measurements. On thin kidney slices obtained from perfusion-fixed kidneys the cortex, medullary and pelvic fractions were measured and subsequently the cortex, medulla and pelvic volumes were calculated. The cortical volume was measured according to three different approaches. The corticomedullary boundary was defined either to the arcuate arteries, to a curved line following the glomeruli, or to a line at the top of the <b>medullary</b> <b>rays.</b> Both in control and diabetic rats, MRI measured kidney volumes were similar to the volume of perfusion-fixed kidneys, while the clamped kidney weight, and in particular the wet kidney weights, were smaller than the MRI obtained volumes.
