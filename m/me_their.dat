500|$|Mahendra {{was married}} thrice. He was first married to Akhileshwari {{with whom he}} had a son. His {{relationship}} with actress Shoba ended in 1980 after she committed suicide following their marriage. Upon her death, the media speculated that Mahendra was responsible for her death. Following that, Mahendra wrote a series of [...] "sentimental musings" [...] in the Tamil magazine Kumudam under the title Shobavum Naanum (lit. Shoba and <b>me).</b> <b>Their</b> relationship was explored by K. G. George (Mahendra's junior at the FTII) in his 1983 Malayalam film Lekhayude Maranam Oru Flashback. When the film was released, Mahendra said that the film {{had nothing to do with}} him and has not discussed about it with George. In 1998, he married another actress Mounika and declared their marriage publicly in 2004.|$|E

People not only showed <b>me</b> <b>their</b> kindness, but more importantly, they {{demonstrated}} their {{love of the game}} of baseball. I give my thanks to baseball fans everywhere. Tonight, I {{want to make sure you}} know how I feel. As I grew up here, I not only had dreams of being a big league ballplayer, but also of being a Baltimore Oriole. For all of your support over the years, I want to thank you, the fans of Baltimore, from the bottom of my heart. This is the greatest place to play." ...|$|E
500|$|The loss of {{her husband}} left Pankhurst with new {{responsibilities}} and {{a significant amount of}} debt. She moved the family to a smaller house at 62 Nelson Street, resigned from the Board of Guardians, and was given a paid position as Registrar of Births and Deaths in Chorlton. This work gave her more insight into the conditions of women in the region. She wrote in her autobiography: [...] "They used to tell <b>me</b> <b>their</b> stories, dreadful stories some of them, and all of them pathetic with that patient and uncomplaining pathos of poverty." [...] Her observations {{of the differences between the}} lives of men and women, for example in relation to illegitimacy, reinforced her conviction that women needed the right to vote before their conditions could improve. In 1900 she was elected to the Manchester School Board and saw new examples of women suffering unequal treatment and limited opportunities. During this time she also re-opened her store, with the hope that it would provide additional income for the family.|$|E

500|$|Actress Kristen Bell {{was cast}} {{as the voice of}} Anna on March 5, 2012. Lee {{admitted}} that Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks Bell had recorded when she was young, where the actress performed several songs from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World". Bell completed her recording sessions while she was pregnant, and subsequently re-recorded some of her character's lines after her pregnancy, as her voice had deepened. Bell was called in to re-record dialogue for the film [...] "probably 20 times," [...] which is normal for lead roles in Disney animated films whose scripts are still evolving. As for her approach to the role of Anna, Bell enthused that she had [...] "dreamed of being in a Disney animated film" [...] since she was four years old, saying, [...] "I always loved Disney animation, {{but there was something about}} the females that was unattainable to <b>me.</b> <b>Their</b> posture was too good and they were too well-spoken, and I feel like I really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and scrappier and more excitable and awkward. I'm really proud of that." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the period}} when Garrow worked as a barrister, the sugar {{planters}} of the West Indies held large amounts of power in Parliament, allowing them to maintain a monopoly on the marketing of sugar in England that brought great profits. This industry was largely profitable due {{to the use of}} slave labour, to which Garrow had long been opposed; when the sugar planters offered him a job managing all of their legal and political business, he replied that [...] "if your committee would give <b>me</b> <b>their</b> whole incomes, and all their estates, I would not be seen as the advocate of practices which I abhor, and a system which I detest". In 1806 Thomas Picton, the Governor of Trinidad, was charged with a single count of [...] "causing torture to be unlawfully inflicted" [...] on a young free mulatto girl; he was brought before the Court of King's Bench under Lord Ellenborough. The court records run to 367 pages, and Garrow was deeply involved as prosecuting counsel; indeed, his opening speech on 24 February 1806 is considered by Braby to be one of his best. The case centred on whether or not Spanish law, which allowed torture, was still in effect {{at the time of the}} incident. The jury eventually decided that it was not, and Ellenborough found Picton guilty. Picton's counsel requested a retrial, which was granted; the jury in the second trial eventually decided that Picton was innocent.|$|E
500|$|In June 2011 {{press reports}} had {{indicated}} that the party was unlikely to run a candidate both for financial reasons and also because {{it was unlikely that}} a Fianna Fáil nominee could be successful. In early August 2011 there was press speculation that RTÉ broadcaster Gay Byrne might seek a nomination. On 6 August Micheál Martin rang Byrne at his holiday home to indicate that Fianna Fáil Oireachtas members would facilitate his nomination. Byrne indicated that he had yet to make a decision on whether to put his name forward, but said that if he did so he would not run under the Fianna Fáil banner but as an independent, albeit {{with the assistance of the}} party's organisation. [...] "Fianna Fáil are convinced no matter who they put up will be unelectable, so they're giving <b>me</b> <b>their</b> support" [...] he told the Irish Independent. Éamon Ó Cuív, the party's deputy leader and member of the committee tasked with deciding on their strategy for the election stated that [...] "I know of no approach to Gay Byrne... Nobody has discussed the issue with me— good, bad or indifferent." [...] On 13 August Byrne informed Martin that he would not be going forward for nomination. He stated that the idea of running had been [...] "foisted on him and he had not known anything about it and what it would involve". This followed unease among Fianna Fáil parliamentary party Oireachtas members, with a number unhappy that a candidate was being imposed by the leadership without discussion.|$|E
