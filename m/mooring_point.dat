25|$|As of 2008 {{there is}} no Pier 49 as such; the site {{used to be the}} Washington Street Boat Landing, but is closed off and unused. This was roughly the site of both the pre-fire and post-fire Yesler's Wharf (see above) and of Piers 1 and 2, built by the Northern Pacific some time between 1901 (when the post-fire Yesler's Wharf was demolished) and 1904. The one {{prominent}} remaining feature of the crumbling wharf is the Harbor Entrance Pergola, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Originally it functioned as a landing point for boats bringing passengers from ships. Over the years since the boat landing was closed, various uses have been proposed, including a terminal for the King County Water Taxi route to West Seattle or a <b>mooring</b> <b>point</b> for the historic tugboat Arthur Foss. As of 2010, the site has become the Downtown terminal for the West Seattle water taxi. On September 26, 2010, a water taxi carrying 78 passengers failed to reverse its engines and slammed into the pier. 7 were injured.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, the Navigation Trust {{was able}} to buy the bed of the river between Carre Street in Sleaford and Bone Mill, which {{included}} the lock and its island at Cogglesford Mill. Lower Kyme lock was refurbished in the winter of 2008. The upper gate is a vertical guillotine gate, and the mechanism required 350 turns of a handle to raise the gate, and another 350 to lower it again. New lock gates were fitted, and a new geared mechanism requiring fewer turns made the lock easier to operate. Around [...] of the waterway from Sleaford to Cogglesford Mill lock were reopened, following the construction of a lifting bridge in the town centre. This was installed in late December 2008, although the hydraulic operating gear was not fitted until January 2010. Work was also carried out to construct a new slipway on Eastgate Green, to allow trailed boats to be launched onto the town section. This involved careful planning to avoid damage to 27 mature trees, and the widening of [...] of the bank to create a <b>mooring</b> <b>point.</b> Funding was provided by Lincolnshire County Council, the Inland Waterways Association, and Waste Recycling Environmental Ltd (WREN), which administers the Landfill Communities Fund. An official opening of the new bridge and facilities took place on 3 July 2010, when three boats were launched from the slipway. Members from canoe clubs at Boston and Sleaford attended.|$|E

The <b>mooring</b> <b>points</b> are close to sources of water or {{culturally}} significant locations like island cemeteries. There are periodic gatherings of Sama-Bajau clans usually for various ceremonies like weddings or festivals. They generally do not sail more than [...] from their [...] "home" [...] moorage. They periodically trade goods with the land-based communities of other Sama-Bajau and other ethnic groups. Sama-Bajau groups may routinely cross {{the borders of the}} Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia for fishing, trading, or visiting relatives.|$|R
50|$|Castle Mills Lock is 34 metres {{long and}} 6 metres wide. There are <b>mooring</b> <b>points</b> {{in the lock}} basin on the River Ouse side with {{overnight}} mooring on the River Foss prohibited. Beyond Rowntree Wharf there are few opportunities for turning.|$|R

50|$|Regulations {{covering}} the Molokini Shoal MLCD (see History above) prohibit fishing, collection or removal of specimens, and fish feeding within its bounds. Additionally, dropping anchor within the MLCD is not permitted {{due to the}} potential of damage to the coral reef. Tour boat operators have been allocated fixed <b>mooring</b> <b>points</b> instead.|$|R
50|$|The broad canal {{has been}} used much more since the {{re-opening}} of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal in 2001, as {{it is no longer}} a dead end, but part of one of three cross-Pennine through-routes. This has resulted in better maintenance of the channel and locks. There is a card-operated pumpout machine at Aspley Basin, and <b>mooring</b> <b>points</b> have fresh water and electric services.|$|R

25|$|A few Sama-Bajau {{still live}} traditionally. They live in houseboats which {{generally}} accommodates a single nuclear family (usually five people). The houseboats travel together in flotillas with houseboats of immediate relatives (a family alliance) and co-operate during fishing expeditions and in ceremonies. A married couple {{may choose to}} sail with the relatives of the husband or the wife. They anchor at common <b>mooring</b> <b>points</b> (called sambuangan) with other flotillas (usually also belonging to extended relatives) at certain times of the year.|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} modern Sama-Bajau who are born and live {{primarily}} at sea is diminishing. Cultural assimilation and modernisation {{are regarded as}} the main causes. Particularly after {{the dissolution of the}} Sultanate of Sulu, who were the traditional patrons of the Sama-Bajau for bartering fish for farm goods. The money-based fish markets which replaced the seasonal trade around <b>mooring</b> <b>points</b> necessitates a more land-based lifestyle for greater market penetration. In Malaysia, some hotly debated government programs have also resettled Bajau to the mainland.|$|R

50|$|The Sopot Pier (Molo w Sopocie) - {{the pier}} {{in the city}} of Sopot, built as a {{pleasure}} pier and as a <b>mooring</b> <b>point</b> for cruise boats, first opened in 1827. At 511.5m, the pier is the longest wooden pier in Europe. It stretches into the sea from the middle of Sopot beach which is a popular venue for recreation and health walks (the concentration of iodine {{at the tip of the}} pier is twice as high as on land) or public entertainment events, and it also serves as a <b>mooring</b> <b>point</b> for cruise boats and water taxis. It is also an excellent point for observing the World Sailing Championship, the Baltic Windsurfing Cup and the Sopot Triathlon taking place on the bay. Sopot pier consists of 2 parts: the famous wooden walking jetty and the Spa Square on land, where concerts and festivities are organised.|$|E
50|$|Typical uses include {{extending}} a berth (a berthing dolphin) or providing a <b>mooring</b> <b>point</b> (a mooring dolphin). Dolphins {{are also used}} to house navigation aids such as lights or daybeacons, and display regulatory information such as speed limits and other safety information, or advertising. They are also used to protect structures from possible impact by ships, {{in a similar fashion}} to boating fenders.|$|E

50|$|This {{sheltered}} site {{is suitable}} for a last dive of an overnight visit to the Doubtful Sound complex of fiords. It lies close to the all-weather <b>mooring</b> <b>points</b> used by overnight excursions {{at the head of}} Precipice Cove, so can be visited using a rigid-hulled inflatable boat. With a climb of the 660 m high Wilmot Pass behind Deep Cove, this shallow dive offers a gentle way to see black coral with minimal risk of a building up of nitrogen credits.|$|R
25|$|Construction was precluded by {{a series}} of {{feasibility}} studies. In 1879, the first of five landings at the rock was carried out, during which currents and ease of docking at the site were assessed. Fishermen from the Île de Sein, begrudgingly or otherwise, successfully established the first <b>mooring</b> <b>points.</b> Six cubic metres of stonework were built for the base, with the help of stonemasons who had already worked on the lighthouse of Ar Men. This enabled the rock to be boarded from the north-east.|$|R
50|$|A Single buoy mooring (SBM) (also {{known as}} single-point mooring or SPM) is a loading buoy {{anchored}} offshore, {{that serves as}} a <b>mooring</b> <b>point</b> and interconnect for tankers loading or offloading gas or liquid products. SPMs are the link between geostatic subsea manifold connections and weathervaning tankers. They are capable of handling any size ship, even very large crude carriers (VLCC) where no alternative facility is available.|$|E
5000|$|Gustav V was {{released}} from the fleet on April 1, 1957. She was supposed to be released to Karlskrona, however she lay at Örlogsbas Bay, south of Stockholm through the year 1967. While there she was used as a <b>mooring</b> <b>point</b> for destroyers and smaller ships [...] Two of the ship's 15.2 cm cannons were moved after the erection of the Kalix Line in Norrbotten, where they were used as fortified cannon.|$|E
50|$|The Skyship 500 {{consists}} of a polyester fabric envelope, retaining helium gas, and carrying a gondola for the control cabin, passenger cabin, propulsion systems and ballast (fixed and jettison-able). The envelope is of a traditional streamlined shape with cruciform tail surfaces which carry rudder and elevator control surfaces for yaw and pitch. The undercarriage {{consists of}} a castoring twin-wheeled oleo-pneumatic strut {{at the rear of}} the gondola, with ground handling ropes for ground crew to manoeuvre the airship on the ground. The nose-cone of the envelope also carries the <b>mooring</b> <b>point</b> which can connect to a mobile mooring mast.|$|E
25|$|Three {{principal}} {{kinds of}} docks existed. Wet docks were where ships were laid up at anchor and loaded or unloaded. Dry docks, which were far smaller, took individual ships for repairing. Ships were built at dockyards along the riverside. In addition, {{the river was}} lined with innumerable warehouses, piers, jetties and dolphins (<b>mooring</b> <b>points).</b> The various docks tended to specialise in different forms of produce. The Surrey Docks concentrated on timber, for instance; Millwall took grain; St Katharine took wool, sugar and rubber; and so on.|$|R
