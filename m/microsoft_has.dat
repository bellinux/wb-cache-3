5|$|Developer {{communities}} {{have used the}} SDK to port later versions of Windows Mobile OS to older devices and making the OS images available for free, thus providing the devices with the current feature set. <b>Microsoft</b> <b>has</b> tolerated this procedure for some time but decided in February 2007 to ask developers to take their OS images off the net, which in turn raised discussions. At the same time Microsoft offered upgrades to Windows Mobile 6 versions to manufacturers for free.|$|E

It obtained an 11.5% stake in Comcast for $1 billion, a 22.98% stake in Telewest Communications for $2.263 billion, and a 3% stake in AT Inc. for $5 billion. Among Microsoft's divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company, only Expedia, Inc. was sold for more than a billion dollars; USA Networks purchased the company on February 5, 2002 for $1.372 billion.|$|E
5|$|Server Message Block version 1 (SMB1) is {{disabled}} by default on version 1709. The Home and the Pro editions only disable the SMB1 server, but retain the SMB1 client, so they can connect to SMB1 network shares. The Enterprise and the Education editions disable the SMB1 entirely. This version of the 30-years-old protocol gained notoriety in the WannaCry ransomware attack, although <b>Microsoft</b> <b>has</b> been discouraging its use even before.|$|E
5|$|Starting with Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, <b>Microsoft</b> <b>has</b> complemented BitLocker {{with the}} Microsoft Encrypted Hard Drive specification, {{which allows the}} {{cryptographic}} operations of BitLocker encryption to be offloaded to the storage device's hardware. In addition, BitLocker can now be managed through Windows PowerShell. Finally, Windows 8 introduced Windows To Go in its Enterprise edition, which BitLocker can protect.|$|E

5|$|Xbox One {{supports}} 4K resolution {{video output}} and 7.1 surround sound. Yusuf Mehdi, corporate {{vice president of}} marketing and strategy for <b>Microsoft,</b> <b>has</b> stated that there is no hardware restriction that would prevent games from running at 4K resolution. Unlike the Xbox 360, the Xbox One does not support 1080i and other interlaced resolutions. Xbox One supports HDMI 1.4 for both input and output, and does not support composite or component video.|$|E
5|$|<b>Microsoft</b> <b>has</b> {{integrated}} Cortana into numerous {{products such}} as Microsoft Edge, the browser bundled with Windows 10. Microsoft's Cortana assistant is deeply integrated into its Edge browser. Cortana can find opening-hours when on restaurant sites, show retail coupons for websites, or show weather information in the address bar. At the Worldwide Partners Conference 2015 Microsoft demonstrated Cortana integration with upcoming {{products such as}} GigJam. Conversely, Microsoft announced in late April 2016 that it would block anything other than Bing and Edge from being used to complete Cortana searches, again raising questions of anticompetitive behavior by the company.|$|E

5|$|In January 2013, a {{privilege}} escalation exploit {{was discovered in}} the Windows kernel that can allow unsigned code to run under Windows RT; the exploit involved {{the use of a}} remote debugging tool (provided by Microsoft to debug WinRT apps on Windows RT devices) to execute code which changes the signing level stored in RAM to allow unsigned code to execute (by default, it is set to a level that only allows code signed by Microsoft to execute). Alongside his explanation of the exploit, the developer also included a personal appeal to Microsoft urging them to remove the restrictions on Windows RT devices, contending that their decision was not for technical reasons, and that the devices would be more valuable if this functionality were available. In a statement, a Microsoft spokesperson applauded the effort, indicating that the exploit does not pose a security threat because it requires administrative access to the device, advanced techniques, and would still require programs to be re-compiled for ARM. However, <b>Microsoft</b> <b>has</b> still indicated that the exploit would be patched in a future update.|$|E
5|$|SH151 {{begins at}} Loop1604, the outer loop around San Antonio, {{on the west}} side of San Antonio and from there follows a southeastern path through the western part of the city. The highway {{provides}} access to the SeaWorld San Antonio theme park as well as industry along its corridor to include Chase, Hyatt Hill Country Resort, World Savings, Philips semiconductor, the National Security Agency campus, QVC, American Funds, Maxim Integrated Products, and the Northwest Vista College, as well as the nearby Southwest Research Institute. <b>Microsoft</b> <b>has</b> also selected the corridor for a $550 million data center. The highway continues to the southeast to a junction with Interstate 410 (I-410), the inner loop around San Antonio. There is not a direct connect interchange at the junction of I-410. It is necessary to travel on both highways' frontage roads in order to change highways. The highway continues to the southeast through mainly undeveloped land until it merges with US90. According to the San Antonio Master Thoroughfare Plan, there are plans to extend SH 151 westward from Loop1604 to SH211. The plan also shows the construction of an interchange at Loop 1604.|$|E
