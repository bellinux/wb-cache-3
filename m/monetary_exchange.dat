This was the first excedent accumulation source. It inverted capital creation, and liberated the agricultural workforce to work in the urban sectors. However, the government imposed on the peasants an unequal exchange with the industrial economy, with credit and fertilizer controls and a non <b>monetary</b> <b>exchange</b> to trade agrarian products (machinery) for rice. With the control of the banks (at the time, being the property of the government), and import licenses, the state oriented the Taiwanese economy to import substitutive industrialization, creating initial capitalism in a fully protected market.|$|E
500|$|Carlos Baker, Hemingway's first biographer, {{believes}} that while Anderson suggested Paris because [...] "the <b>monetary</b> <b>exchange</b> rate" [...] {{made it an}} inexpensive place to live, more importantly it was where [...] "the most interesting people in the world" [...] lived. In Paris, Hemingway met writers such as Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and Ezra Pound who [...] "could help a young writer up the rungs of a career". The Hemingway of the early Paris years was a [...] "tall, handsome, muscular, broad-shouldered, brown-eyed, rosy-cheeked, square-jawed, soft-voiced young man." [...] He and Hadley {{lived in a small}} walk-up at 74 rue du Cardinal Lemoine [...] in the Latin Quarter, and he worked in a rented room in a nearby building. [...] Stein, who was the bastion of modernism in Paris, became Hemingway's mentor and godmother to his son Jack; she introduced him to the expatriate artists and writers of the Montparnasse Quarter, whom she referred to as the [...] "Lost Generation"—a term Hemingway popularized with the publication of The Sun Also Rises. A regular at Stein's salon, Hemingway met influential painters such as Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, and Juan Gris. He eventually withdrew from Stein's influence and their relationship deteriorated into a literary quarrel that spanned decades. The American poet Ezra Pound met Hemingway by chance at Sylvia Beach's bookshop Shakespeare and Company in 1922. The two toured Italy in 1923 and lived on the same street in 1924. They forged a strong friendship, and in Hemingway, Pound recognized and fostered a young talent. Pound introduced Hemingway to the Irish writer James Joyce, with whom Hemingway frequently embarked on [...] "alcoholic sprees".|$|E

The study highlights several structural characteristics of São Tomé and PrÃ­ncipe including its very small size, high degree of openness, extensive use of foreign currencies, and inflexible product and factor markets in the consideration of an appropriate <b>monetary</b> and <b>exchange</b> regime. Firmly anchored currency arrangements, defined in this paper to include memberships in monetary unions or hard pegs, are found to be preferable to the status quo of a managed float. The paper applies statistical methods and takes into account other factors to identify the appropriate anchor currency.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of the Ghanaian macroeconomy, this paper explores the {{monetary}} factors underlying the changing levels of remittance inflows, and the implications of remittance inflows for monetary aggregates, interest rate, exchange rate, and the domestic price level. The theoretical framework of the study is based on a modified variable-price Mundell-Fleming model. A five-variable Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model is estimated using quarterly data between 1983 (4) and 2005 (4). The estimated static long-run model shows that <b>monetary</b> aggregates, <b>exchange</b> rate, and interest rate positively impact on remittance inflows while domestic price level negatively impact on remittance inflows. <b>Monetary</b> aggregates, <b>exchange</b> rate, interest rate and domestic price level impact on one another while remittances positively drive itself, <b>monetary</b> aggregates, <b>exchange</b> rate and interest rate. The impulse response functions reveal that remittance inflows respond to its own shocks but not to shocks emanating from <b>monetary</b> aggregates, <b>exchange</b> rate, interest rate, and the price level. Variance decompositions show that, during the first quarter, remittances are self-driven. Since remittances are significantly impacted by <b>monetary</b> aggregates, <b>exchange</b> rate, interest rate, and the domestic price level, prudent <b>monetary</b> and <b>exchange</b> rate policies should be specially formulated and selectively conducted to attract international remittances to Ghana.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{implications}} of high degrees of dollarization for the choice of exchange rate regime and the information content of various monetary aggregates in developing countries. We conclude that {{a high degree of}} currency substitution argues for a more fixed exchange rate regime, while asset substitution may imply that either more rigid or more flexible regimes may be appropriate. We also ask whether the most informative monetary aggregates include dollar assets. Based on an analysis of five countries, we conclude inter alia that broader aggregates that include dollar assets perform better than those that do not.

More specifically, as an anticipated devaluation under an exchange rate rule leads to well-known contractionary effects, an anticipated increase in the money stock under a monetary rule, though initially expansionary, becomes contractionary when these expectations are not validated. This suggests that much of the criticism of an exchange rate anchor implicitly considers not another rule but rather, discretion as the alternative.
