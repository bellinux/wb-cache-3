40|$|We {{investigate}} {{changes in}} {{competition in the}} Dutch notary profession after a partial deregulation {{of the market for}} notary services enforced by the 1999 Dutch Notary Act. This reform liberalized prices and relieved many entry barriers in the profession, while keeping the professional standard in place. We use the concept of entry thresholds developed by Bresnahan and Reiss (1991) to infer on the effect of entry on competition before and after the regulatory reform. We find that entry affects conduct in the Dutch notary profession as a second notary office in a market requires a much larger market size than a <b>monopoly</b> <b>office</b> to be profitable, suggesting that profit margins drop with entry. Yet, we find no significant differences between entry thresholds ratios before and after the regulatory reform.

Thus municipal broadband is safe until another President who favors the Cable <b>monopoly</b> takes <b>office</b> because FCC orders can be reversed as Presidents change.

50|$|Spooner's {{influence}} {{extends to}} {{the wide range of}} topics he addressed during his lifetime. He is remembered primarily for his abolitionist activities and for his challenge to the Post <b>Office</b> <b>monopoly,</b> which had a lasting influence of significantly reducing postal rates. Spooner's writings contributed to the development of both left-libertarian and right-libertarian political theory in the United States, and were often reprinted in early libertarian journals such as the Rampart Journal and Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought. His writings were also a major influence on Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard and right-libertarian law professor and legal theorist Randy Barnett.|$|R
5000|$|This was a {{challenge}} to the United States Post <b>Office's</b> <b>monopoly.</b> As he had done when challenging the rules of the Massachusetts Bar Association, he published a pamphlet titled [...] "The Unconstitutionality of the Laws of Congress Prohibiting Private Mails". Although Spooner had finally found commercial success with his mail company, legal challenges by the government eventually exhausted his financial resources. A law enacted in 1851 that strengthened the federal government's monopoly finally put him out of business. The lasting legacy of Spooner's challenge to the postal service was the three-cent stamp, adopted in response to the competition his company provided.|$|R

In July 1655 the Post Office was put under the direct government control of John Thurloe, a Secretary of State, and best known to history as Cromwell's spymaster general.

One standard work remarks that under the Ming dynasty, the elite who held privileged status through passing the Imperial exams were called shenshi 紳士 or jinshen 縉紳.

Through education this elite held a virtual <b>monopoly</b> on <b>office</b> holding, and overlapped with an unofficial elite of the wealthy.

In Bohemia, for example, he authorized Czech as an official language of the bureaucracy and school system, thus breaking the German speakers' <b>monopoly</b> on holding <b>office.</b> Such reforms encouraged other ethnic groups to push for greater autonomy as well. By playing nationalities off one another, the government ensured the monarchy's central role in holding together competing interest groups in an era of rapid change.|$|R

An outraged public complained that they were losing part of their heritage. KC have retained approx 125 K6s in use today.

No document of Lando's chancery has survived. The only act of his reign that is recorded is a donation to the diocese of Sabina mentioned in a judicial act of 1431.

Naturally, it focuses on the Home Office and the UK Border Agency, raising a number of questions that are still to be answered following the announced abolition of UKBA in March. The key issues addressed are: The Home <b>Office's</b> <b>monopoly</b> on immigration policymaking, even though it is a cross-cutting issue with impacts and implications for almost every department in Whitehall The 'culture of caution' that threatens to suffocate the Home Office. The confused structure and poor communication that led the Home Office and UKBA to operate as almost completely separate organisations, widening the gap between policy and implementation. The tension between evidence-based policymaking and political demands, which undermines the ability of researchers and policymakers to make effective use of evidence to inform and support their decisions...|$|R
