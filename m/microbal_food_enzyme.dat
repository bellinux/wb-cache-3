This The <b>food</b> <b>enzyme</b> {{considered in}} this opinion is a 4 -α-D-glucan maltohydrolase (EC 3. 2. 1. 2) obtained from grain of barley (Hordeum vulgare), by the companies Genencor International B. V. and Senson Oy. This β-amylase {{is intended to be}} used in several food-manufacturing processes: baking and brewing processes, distilled alcohol production, and starch processing for the production of glucose syrups. The compositional data provided for the <b>food</b> <b>enzyme</b> were considered sufficient. The manufacturing process did not raise safety concerns. Based on the maximum use levels recommended for the respective food processes, dietary exposure to the food enzyme–total organic solids (TOS) was estimated on the basis of individual data from the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database. This exposure estimate is similar to or lower than the exposure to a fraction of barley comparable to the food enzyme– TOS, resulting from the consumption of barley-derived foods. As the <b>food</b> <b>enzyme</b> is derived from edible parts of barley, in line with the requirements of the guidance document on <b>food</b> <b>enzyme</b> assessment, the Panel accepted that {{there was no need for}} the provision of toxicological data for this <b>food</b> <b>enzyme.</b> Barley is known as a gluten-containing cereal; however, the gluten content in the <b>food</b> <b>enzyme</b> was found to be below the detection limit of the applied analytical method and well below the threshold value of 20 mg/kg for ‘gluten-free’ products. Furthermore, the potential allergenicity was evaluated by searching for similarity between the amino acid sequence of β-amylase and the sequences of known food allergens; no match was found. Based on the origin of the <b>food</b> <b>enzyme</b> from edible parts of barley, the enzymemanufacturing process, the compositional and biochemical data provided, the allergenicity and dietary exposure assessment, the Panel concluded that this <b>food</b> <b>enzyme</b> does not give rise to safety concerns under the intended conditions of use...|$|R

40|$|The <b>food</b> <b>enzyme</b> {{considered}} in this opinion is a beta-amylase (EC 3. 2. 1. 2), {{obtained from the}} grain of wheat (Triticum spp.) by Roquette (France). The beta-amylase {{is intended to be}} used in starch processing for production of glucose syrups containing maltose {{to be used as a}} food ingredient. Since the presence of residual amounts of total organic solids (TOS) in glucose syrups after filtration and purification during starch processing is negligible, no dietary exposure was calculated. As the <b>food</b> <b>enzyme</b> is derived from edible parts of wheat, no toxicological tests are required. Wheat is known as a gluten-containing cereal. However, the gluten content of the <b>food</b> <b>enzyme</b> was shown to be below the limit of quantification of the applied analytical method and well below the threshold value of 20 mg/kg for 'gluten-free' products. Furthermore, the potential allergenicity was evaluated by searching for similarity between the amino acid sequence of the beta-amylase and the sequences of known food allergens; no match was found. Although b-amylase from wheat is described as a potential occupational respiratory allergen, and oral wheat challenges in wheat allergic patients may result in clinical symptoms, the enzyme and the low levels of other wheat proteins will be removed from the final food ingredients through a downstream purification process.

40|$|The {{majority}} of industrial enzymes available at present {{is used in}} food industry. Safe-ty regulations of <b>food</b> <b>enzymes</b> differ among countries, including fundamental aspects, whether a pre-market approval is needed and {{on the level of}} details, e. g. what particular information manufacturers have to provide in the course of safety evaluation. Occupa-tional safety concerns focus on allergenic properties as it is well established that enzymes are potent inhalative sensitizers and can cause allergic reactions including asthma. Other-wise toxic substances including bacterial toxins and mycotoxins might also be present in en-zyme isolates and might thus constitute a safety risk to consumers. Safety evaluation pro-cedures seem to be appropriate as no incidents have been reported so far, resulting in sug-gestion for reduced test packages. Safety precaution and monitoring measures established by industry have also reduced but not entirely eradicated occupational risks. Challenges to regulators and industry arise from unresolved issues, e. g. whether enzymes might be contact sensitizers, and from the lack of harmonisation of both legislation and safety eval-uation. In the EU, most <b>food</b> <b>enzymes</b> are not covered by food safety regulations neither on Community nor on national level.

40|$|The <b>food</b> <b>enzyme</b> {{considered}} in this opinion is a beta-amylase (EC 3. 2. 1. 2) from soybean submitted by Nagase (Europa) GmbH. This beta-amylase {{is intended to}} be used in the starch processing for maltose syrup production and the manufacture of a Japanese rice cake type. Based on the maximum use levels recommended for the respective food processes, dietary exposure to the food enzyme-total organic solids (TOS) was estimated on the basis of Japanese consumption data. Conservative average infant formula consumption, as reported in the EFSA Draft Guidance on risk assessment of substances present in food intended for infants below 16 weeks of age, was used to estimate the exposure to a fraction of soybean comparable to the food enzyme-TOS, resulting from the consumption of soybeanderived foods. The exposure estimate to the food enzyme-TOS was found to be lower than the comparable fraction from the source material. Potential allergenicity of the beta-amylase was evaluated by searching for similarity of the amino acid sequence to those of known allergens, and no match was found. The b-amylase is produced from soybean, which is a known allergenic food. Japanese rice cake, consequently, may contain traces of soybean allergens, which may give rise to safety concerns in soybean-allergic consumers. Based on the origin of the <b>food</b> <b>enzyme</b> from edible parts of soybean, the manufacturing process, the compositional and biochemical data provided and the dietary intake estimates, the Panel concluded that this <b>food</b> <b>enzyme</b> does not give rise to safety concerns under the intended conditions of use, except that Japanese rice cake produced with this <b>food</b> <b>enzyme</b> may contain traces of soybean allergens...|$|R

The endo- 1, 4 -beta-xylanase {{is intended to be}} used in baking processes. Based on the maximum use levels recommended for the respective food process, dietary exposure to the food enzyme-total organic solids (TOS) was estimated on the basis of individual data from the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database. This exposure estimate is below 0. 013 mg TOS/kg body weight (bw) per day in European populations. No safety concerns were identified in relation to the genetic modifications performed, the manufacturing process, the compositional and biochemical data provided, allergenicity and exposure assessments. The allergenicity was evaluated by comparing the amino acid sequence to those of known allergens; no match was found. The Panel considered that the likelihood of allergic reactions to dietary intake of endo- 1, 4 -beta-xylanase is low and, therefore, does not give rise to safety concerns. The systemic toxicity was assessed by means of a repeated dose 90 -day oral toxicity study in rodents. A no observed adverse effect level was derived (4, 095 and 4, 457 mg TOS/kg bw per day for males and females, respectively), which, compared with the dietary exposure, results in a sufficiently high margin of exposure. However, the genotoxicity data were incomplete. Due to the absence of the recommended combination of microbial strains used in the Ames test (i. e. lack of Salmonella Typhimurium TA 102 and Escherichia coli WP 2), no conclusions can be drawn on potential DNA oxidising or cross-linking mechanisms giving rise to gene mutations. Consequently, no final conclusions can be drawn on genotoxicity...|$|R

The methodological aspects and the queries used in the systematic search and the procedure applied for the screening of retrieved scientific documents are described in this report. Details are available in supplementary appendices to this report. In total, 22970 scientific documents were screened in the literature search from which 411 were initially selected for providing pertinent data for the scope of the project. From the review of the selected articles, 474 bioactive secondary metabolites were recorded and 59 compounds were further studied for obtaining data on their toxicology and characteristic of their production by microorganisms used in industrial fermentations. The database generated in this project comprises details that characterized the conditions, genes involved and toxicity of these 59 compounds. This provides information {{that can be used to}} establish safety measures when using potentially toxigenic microorganisms in industrial fermentations. The searching strategy was defined after a preliminary study in which, general information about the fermentative process involving the microorganisms within the scope was obtained. This allowed to identify possible problems that can arise when retrieving data from this heterogeneous group of microorganisms.
