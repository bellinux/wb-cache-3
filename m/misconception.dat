5|$|A common <b>misconception</b> is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a {{transparent}} imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Understanding how <b>misconceptions</b> {{are formed}} {{can make it}} easier for {{classroom}} teachers to help their students uncover and overcome their <b>misconceptions.</b> Teachers, however, cannot be expected to help children uncover <b>misconceptions</b> if they hold these <b>misconceptions</b> themselves. This study attempts to discover which common <b>misconceptions</b> are held by pre-service elementary teachers and to what they attribute these <b>misconceptions.</b> A questionnaire containing several common earth and space science <b>misconceptions</b> was administered to 97 pre-service elementary teachers. A discussion of the concepts on the questionnaire followed during which participants were asked to reflect on their “incorrect” responses. Results from the survey are compared to an earlier cross-age survey conducted by the author in which the same questions were asked. The study suggests that many <b>misconceptions</b> originate in the classroom and that pre-service elementary education teachers have many of the same <b>misconceptions</b> that their future students will have...|$|R

Nine teachers from public schools were purposefully selected to participate in the study. Qualitative data were collected from questionnaires and interviews. It was found that teachers often indicate simple <b>misconceptions</b> as sources of learners’ mistakes, but that <b>misconceptions</b> related to incorrect analysis are seldom mentioned. Furthermore, it was found that these teachers’ knowledge about <b>misconceptions</b> was fragmented and not integrated with their understanding of basic concepts.

40|$|Educational {{research}} indicates that eradicating <b>misconceptions</b> may require that instructors explicitly address and correct them. Knowing what these <b>misconceptions</b> are is an important first step. Numerous <b>misconceptions</b> surrounding photosynthesis and respiration have been reported, but published articles focused on other aspects of plant biology are less abundant and scattered in the literature. In order to identify other <b>misconceptions,</b> we extensively screened the literature and found various student <b>misconceptions</b> about plant nutrition, classification, diffusion and osmosis, water relationships, ecology, reproduction, genetics, growth, development, plant and cellular structure, and defense. While <b>misconceptions</b> may vary in type and complexity in these areas, they permeate all age groups and levels of education, from preschool through pre-service educators. To assist educators in correcting these <b>misconceptions</b> through curriculum development, we have mapped these <b>misconceptions</b> onto the Core Concepts for Plant Biology Education as delineated by the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB) and the Botanical Society of America (BSA). Our mapping revealed a number of core concepts for which <b>misconceptions</b> have not been reported and warrant further research...|$|R

5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common <b>misconception</b> is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates.

In computer strategy games, ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons in the Master of Orion series of games or the ChCht in Deadlock II.

40|$|The study {{explored}} <b>misconceptions</b> in electrostatics {{and their}} origins amongst learners at entry {{point in a}} South African University. Available literature showed <b>misconceptions</b> in electrostatics amongst High School learners and confirmed textbooks {{as one of the}} sources of <b>misconceptions.</b> It was therefore important to look for <b>misconceptions</b> in electrostatics amongst first year Bachelor of Science (B. Sc 1) learners in physics courses and their origins {{at the start of the}} academic year. The study also explored educators' <b>misconceptions</b> in the topic to check whether they could also be a source of learners' <b>misconceptions.</b> The results were intended to give guidance on how to eliminate learners' <b>misconceptions</b> at school rather than carrying them to higher education institutions. The study used the ex-post facto research design and was a case-study. The ex-post facto research design enabled the researcher to investigate whether one or more pre-existing conditions have possibly caused the existing problem of <b>misconceptions.</b> The sample consisted of 198 learners from B. Sc 1 physics course and 28 educators from 15 High Schools in one education district in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The data were collected through questionnaires, analysis of textbooks, and interviews. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17 was used for quantitative analysis whereas categorization and coding were used for qualitative analysis. The study revealed that learners had <b>misconceptions</b> in electrostatics. The origins of <b>misconceptions</b> were traced to educators, textbooks, intuition, daily language and lack of hands-on activities. It emerged from the study that educators also had <b>misconceptions</b> and the cause of their <b>misconceptions</b> were textbooks, websites and gaps in content knowledge. The recommendations from the study were the following: identify preliminary knowledge of learners during introduction of the lesson; introduce the iii constructivist approach to teaching in the teacher training curriculum so that learners at school can be taught using the same approach; frequent upgrading of educators through inservice workshops to reduce educators' <b>misconceptions</b> which, in turn, will help to reduce the <b>misconceptions</b> among learners; introduction of conceptual change textbooks...|$|R

Although {{it could be argued}} that Dyer may have boxed 94 fights between these years, and may have turned professional in 1908, it is widely accepted that his fight with Dick Emden in 1911 in which he dislocated his knee was a loss.
