5|$|If {{you do not}} {{hurry to}} fight at sea, but keep your ships here and stay near land, or even advance into the Peloponnese, then, <b>my</b> <b>lord,</b> you will easily {{accomplish}} what you had in mind on coming here. The Hellenes {{are not able to}} hold out against you for a long time, but you will scatter them, and they will each flee to their own cities.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Gallilee {{once more}} offered his testimony. [...] "The biggest Piper on <b>my</b> <b>lord's</b> estate," [...] he began, [...] "comes of a Highland family, and was removed to the Lowlands by <b>my</b> <b>lord's</b> father. A great player--" ...|$|R

25|$|The {{condition}} of the State was thus. Viz. the Rump, after being disturbed by <b>my</b> <b>Lord</b> Lambert, was lately returned to sit again. The officers of the army all forced to yield. Lawson lie still in the River and Monke is with his army in Scotland. Only <b>my</b> <b>Lord</b> Lambert is not yet come in to the Parliament; nor is it expected that he will, without being forced to it.|$|E
25|$|And may there come, o <b>my</b> <b>Lord,</b> thine Holy Spirit {{and rest}} upon this {{offering}} of thy servants and bless it and hallow {{it that it}} be to us, o <b>my</b> <b>Lord,</b> for the pardon of offences and the remission of sins and for the great hope of resurrection from the dead and for {{new life in the}} kingdom of heaven with all those who have been wellpleasing in thy sight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let <b>my</b> <b>lords</b> look yonder {{where it}} is darkest, if they would find the stones," [...] said Gagool, {{interpreting}} our looks. [...] "There <b>my</b> <b>lords</b> will find a nook, and three stone chests in the nook, two sealed and one open." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is well, <b>my</b> <b>lords.</b> To-day, {{two hours}} after sunset, Twala will send for <b>my</b> <b>lords</b> to witness the girls dance, and one hour after the dance begins the girl whom Twala thinks the fairest shall be killed by Scragga, the king's son, as a {{sacrifice}} to the Silent Ones, who sit and keep watch by the mountains yonder," [...] and he pointed towards the three strange-looking peaks where Solomon's road was supposed to end.

6000|$|... “So you are <b>my</b> <b>lord’s</b> go-between?” {{she went}} on, not {{regarding}} this speech. “You {{are sent to}} bid me back into slavery again, and inform me that <b>my</b> <b>lord’s</b> favour is graciously restored to his handmaid?
