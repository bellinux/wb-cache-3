5|$|During the summer, {{a mass of}} hot and wet air, {{brought by}} the south and western {{maritime}} winds, creates Póvoa de Varzim's characteristic fog covering only the coast and with strong ocean scent brought in by the marine layer, which is composed of salt from surf and sea spray, with lesser amounts of iodine from the outlying kelp forests. Sunshine duration values are high, between April and September the <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> always over 217 hours, peaking in July with 308 hours. The gloomiest months are December and January with 124 hours each (1961–1990 data). Solar irradiance is high in the city's beaches, and lower inland and in the northwestern coast. The prevailing northern winds, known as Nortadas, arise in the summer after midday. Strongest wind gusts are felt in the city's sands and only reaching inland in municipalities south of Póvoa de Varzim.|$|E
5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

40|$|As estimators of {{location}} parameters, univariate trimmed <b>means</b> <b>are</b> {{well known for}} their robustness and efficiency. They can serve as robust alternatives to the sample mean while possessing high efficiencies at normal as well as heavy-tailed models. This paper introduces multidimensional trimmed means based on projection depth induced regions. Robustness of these depth trimmed <b>means</b> <b>is</b> investigated {{in terms of the}} influence function and finite sample breakdown point. The influence function captures the local robustness whereas the breakdown point measures the global robustness of estimators. It is found that the projection depth trimmed <b>means</b> <b>are</b> highly robust locally as well as globally. Asymptotics of the depth trimmed <b>means</b> <b>are</b> investigated via those of the directional radius of the depth induced regions. The strong consistency, asymptotic representation and limiting distribution of the depth trimmed <b>means</b> <b>are</b> obtained. Relative to the mean and other leading competitors, the depth trimmed <b>means</b> <b>are</b> highly efficient at normal or symmetric models and overwhelmingly more efficient when these models are contaminated. Simulation studies confirm the validity of the asymptotic efficiency results at finite samples.
