40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} the sentiment of a <b>message</b> on social media and its virality, defined as the volume and speed of <b>message</b> diffusion. We analyze 4. 1 million <b>messages</b> (tweets) obtained from Twitter. Although factors affecting <b>message</b> diffusion on social media have been studied previously, we focus on <b>message</b> sentiment and reveal how the polarity of <b>message</b> sentiment affects its virality. The virality of a <b>message</b> is characterized by the number of <b>message</b> repostings (retweets) and the time elapsed from the original posting of a <b>message</b> to its Nth reposting (N-retweet time). Through extensive analysis using the 4. 1 million tweets and their retweets in 1 week, we discover that negative <b>messages</b> are likely to be reposted more rapidly and frequently than positive and neutral <b>messages.</b> Specifically, the reposting volume of negative <b>messages</b> is 20 â 60 % higher than that of positive and neutral <b>messages,</b> and negative <b>messages</b> spread 25 % faster than positive and neutral <b>messages</b> when the diffusion volume is quite high. We also perform longitudinal analysis of <b>message</b> diffusion observed over 1 year and find that recurrent diffusion of negative <b>messages</b> is less frequent than that of positive and neutral <b>messages.</b> Moreover, we present a simple <b>message</b> diffusion model that can reproduce the characteristics of <b>message</b> diffusion observed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To motivate {{individuals}} {{to adhere to}} a regular physical activity regime, guidelines must be supplemented with persuasive <b>messages</b> that are disseminated widely. While substantial research has examined effective strategies for disseminating physical activity <b>messages,</b> {{there has been no}} systematic effort to examine optimal <b>message</b> content. This paper reviews studies that evaluate the effectiveness of three approaches for constructing physical activity <b>messages</b> including tailoring <b>messages</b> to suit individual characteristics of <b>message</b> recipients (<b>message</b> tailoring), framing <b>messages</b> in terms of gains versus losses (<b>message</b> framing), and targeting <b>messages</b> to affect change in self-efficacy (i. e., a theoretical determinant of behavior change). Methods We searched the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE and CINAHL databases up to July 2008. Relevant reference lists also were searched. We included intervention trials, field experiments, and laboratory-based studies that aimed to test the efficacy or effectiveness of tailored <b>messages,</b> framed <b>messages</b> and self-efficacy change <b>messages</b> among healthy adults. We used a descriptive approach to analyze emerging patterns in research findings. Based on this evidence we made recommendations for practice and future research. Results Twenty-two studies were identified. Twelve studies evaluated <b>message</b> tailoring. In 10 of these studies, tailored <b>messages</b> resulted in greater physical activity than a control <b>message.</b> Six studies evaluated framed <b>messages.</b> Five of these studies demonstrated that gain-framed <b>messages</b> lead to stronger intentions to be active compared to a control <b>message.</b> Moreover, a gain-frame advantage was evident in three of the four studies that assessed physical activity. Four studies evaluated self-efficacy change <b>messages.</b> The two studies that used an experimental design provide a clear indication that individuals' beliefs can be affected by <b>messages</b> that incorporate types of information known to be determinants of self-efficacy. Overall, strong evidence to support definitive recommendations for optimal <b>message</b> content and structure was lacking. Conclusions Additional research testing the optimal content of <b>messages</b> used to supplement physical activity guidelines is needed. Tailored <b>messages,</b> gain-framed <b>messages,</b> and self-efficacy change <b>messages</b> hold promise as strategies for constructing physical activity <b>messages</b> and should be a focus of future research. </p...|$|R
