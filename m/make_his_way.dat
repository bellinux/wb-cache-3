A plot was hatched to disgrace him and Dunstan was accused of being involved with witchcraft and black magic. The king ordered him to leave the court and as Dunstan was leaving the palace his enemies physically attacked him, beat him severely, bound him, and threw him into a cesspool. He managed to crawl out and <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the house of a friend. From there, he journeyed to Winchester and entered the service of his uncle, Ælfheah, Bishop of Winchester.|$|E

5|$|Orozco {{remained}} unsatisfied {{with the}} political positions he was offered in the Madero government. He became even more angry when Madero asked him to fight Zapata in central Mexico. As a result, in March 1912--less {{than a year after}} the battle of Ciudad Juárez--Orozco formally declared himself in rebellion against Madero. He subsequently supported Victoriano Huerta in his coup d'état against Madero. After Huerta's fall Orozco went into exile in the US and was eventually killed by Texas Rangers while trying to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back into Mexico to start another revolt.|$|E

5|$|When Norway was {{invaded by}} Germany in April 1940, Lie {{immediately}} started organising resistance, {{taking charge of}} free radio broadcasts from various locations in the country. For two months this work kept him in constant movement around Norway, and on 7 June 1940, when King Haakon VII and the government left the country for London, he was in Vadsø, replacing a broken transmitter. At this point further broadcasts became impossible, and Lie had to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> south, through Finland and Sweden, to Oslo. Here he {{became involved in the}} underground labour movement, mainly through printing newspapers and spreading information.|$|E

However, as he got up, he then fell to his knees before collapsing to the ground. He was immediately carried to the stadium's medical room where attempts were made to resuscitate him.|$|E
5|$|After France surrendered, Marcinkus {{managed to}} <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the French colonies in Africa (Morocco and Algeria). He {{decided to go}} to Great Britain and {{continue}} fighting, but the French army's terms of armistice at Compiègne and tensions between Britain and France made this difficult. On 12 August 1940 he was finally demobilized from the French army. Marcinkus and some of his associates concocted a daring plan to commandeer several aircraft without authorization and fly to England. The plan was not executed due to increased security at airfields and other circumstances. He finally received the necessary documents enabling him to go to Britain in autumn of 1940.|$|E

5|$|Having become {{versed in}} Kuba {{language}} and culture, Sheppard took {{a team of}} men {{to the edge of}} Kuba territory in 1892. His original plan was to ask for directions to the next village under the guise of purchasing supplies, but the chief of the village only allowed one of his men to go. Sheppard used a variety of tricks to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> further into the kingdom, including having a scout follow a group of traders and, most famously, eating so many eggs that the townspeople could no longer supply him and his scout was able {{to gain access to the}} next village to find more eggs. Eventually, however, he encountered villagers that would allow him to go no further. While Sheppard was formulating a plan, the king's son, Prince N'toinzide, arrived and arrested Sheppard and his men for trespassing.|$|E
5|$|In July 1914, Cubitt was {{appointed}} Deputy Commissioner and Officer Commanding for the Somaliland Protectorate; after the disastrous Battle of Dul Madoba, the colonial administration {{was seeking to}} restore British control over the inland areas of the Protectorate. Cubitt planned and commanded a series of operations through the winter of 1914-15, destroying several Dervish forts. Shortly after he arrived in Somaliland, the First World War had broken out, and once the winter campaign was over he requested {{to be transferred to}} Europe; the request was granted, but it took until early 1916 for him to be replaced and <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> home. For his services in Africa, he {{was appointed}} a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and a Companion of the Bath, and promoted to brevet Colonel.|$|E
5|$|On 2 February 2005, Hardee's {{body was}} {{recovered}} from Greenland Dock, {{after he was}} reported missing from The Wibbley Wobbley on 31 January; he had been last seen late-night on 30 January. A post-mortem soon confirmed he had drowned. In an inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court on 20 July, Coroner John Sampson recorded a verdict of accidental death. It had been assumed in several reports of his death that, while trying to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> home by dinghy from The Wibbley Wobbley to his houseboat The Sea Sovereign just fifteen yards away across Greenland Dock, Hardee had lost his balance and drowned while drunk. But the Coroner found that, whilst attempting to access The Sea Sovereign from the quayside, Hardee {{had fallen into the}} dock while drunk.|$|E

5|$|On June 6, 1944, and afterward, {{most of the}} American {{airborne}} landings in Normandy {{were flown}} into areas that were not studded with Rommelspargel. Some flights, however, came up hard against the defense. Accompanying the 82nd Airborne Division, Tito Moruza landed on D-Day with orders to don civilian clothing and <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Paris to seize Gestapo papers. His glider hit a wooden pole defense which tore into the three soldiers sitting next to him, mortally wounding them. More casualties were inflicted during delivery of glider infantry reinforcements when some 16–18 gliders landed {{in a field of}} Rommelspargel and the troops that crawled from the wrecked gliders were immediately targeted by German small arms fire. Of 250 troops landing, some 50–60 survived.|$|E
5|$|When Ladislaus of Naples conquered Rome in 1413, John XXIII {{was forced}} to flee to Florence. He was {{compelled}} by Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, to convoke the Council of Constance in 1414, although when the threat to his pontificate and possibly his person became apparent, he fled in 1415. Although he expected his departure would disperse the council, the members of which he called to join him {{under the protection of}} Frederick IV, Duke of Austria, it continued to operate where they were. As John XXIII tried to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> towards the territory of John II, Duke of Burgundy, Frederick IV surrendered him to the custody of Sigismund and the Council, and he was imprisoned by Louis III.|$|E
5|$|According to oral history, Rainilaiarivony {{was born}} on a {{day of the week}} {{traditionally}} viewed as inauspicious for births. Custom in much of Madagascar dictated that such unlucky children had to be subjected to a trial by ordeal, such as prolonged exposure to the elements, since it was believed the misfortune of their day of birth would ensure a short and cursed life for the child and its family. But rather than leave the child to die, Rainilaiarivony's father reportedly followed the advice of an ombiasy (astrologer) and instead amputated a joint from two fingers on his infant son's left hand to dispel the ill omen. The infant was nonetheless kept outside the house to avert the possibility that evil might still befall the family if the child remained under their roof. Relatives took pity and adopted Rainilaiarivony to raise him within their own home. Meanwhile, Rainilaiarivony's older brother Rainivoninahitriniony enjoyed the double privilege of his status as elder son and freedom from a predestined evil fate. Rainiharo selected and groomed his elder son to follow in his footsteps as Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister, while Rainilaiarivony was left to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> in the world by his own merits.|$|E

5|$|Hare was {{released}} on 5 February 1829—his extended stay in custody had been undertaken for his own protection—and was assisted in leaving Edinburgh in disguise by the mailcoach to Dumfries. At one of its stops he was recognised by a fellow-passenger, Erskine Douglas Sandford, a junior counsel who had represented Wilson's family; Sandford informed his fellow passengers of Hare's identity. On arrival in Dumfries the news of Hare's presence spread and a large crowd gathered at the hostelry where he was due to stay the night. Police arrived and arranged for a decoy coach to draw off the crowd while Hare escaped through a back window and into a carriage which {{took him to the}} town's prison for safekeeping. A crowd surrounded the building; stones were thrown at the door and windows and street lamps were smashed before 100 special constables arrived to restore order. In the small hours of the morning, escorted by a sheriff officer and militia guard, Hare was taken out of town, set down on the Annan Road and instructed to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the English border. There were no subsequent reliable sightings of him and his eventual fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The 4e DI {{was ordered}} {{to hold the line}} of the Sambre river. De Hauteclocque was placed in charge of three {{infantry}} battalions. To his dismay, orders came to pull back to the Canal de l'Escaut. From there the 4e DI retreated northward, becoming encircled in the Lille pocket on 28 May. De Hauteclocque received permission to escape through German lines. He attempted to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back to the French lines by pretending to be a civilian refugee, but was apprehended by a German patrol and taken prisoner when they discovered an old military pay receipt. He was taken back to a German command post, where he secretly destroyed the receipt. He convinced a German colonel that he had been wounded in Morocco, suffered from malaria, and had six children, all of which was true, and he was thus exempted from military service, which was false. The Germans let him go. He then {{made his way to the}} Crozat Canal, swam across, and encountered a French patrol.|$|E
5|$|The portal {{takes the}} marine {{directly}} into Hell, where he proceeds to fight {{his way through}} the large number of demons to the Soul Cube, defeating its demonic guardian.

Betruger, however, tells the marine that although the main UAC teleporter has been destroyed, Hell is opening a Hellmouth on Mars, capable of bringing millions of demons to Mars. Further in the Delta Labs, the marine encounters the injured Swann. Swann informs the marine that Kelly has been working with Hell for possibly the whole time, and has been transformed by the demons. Telling the marine that Campbell has gone after Kelly, Swann gives the marine his PDA containing information on the location on the Hellmouth under the surface of Mars and assures him that he will try to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> out of the base alone.|$|E
