5|$|Stegosaurus {{made its}} major public debut as a papier mache model {{commissioned}} by the U.S. National <b>Museum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The model was based on Knight's latest miniature with the double row of staggered plates, and was exhibited in the United States Government Building at the exposition in St. Louis before being relocated to Portland, Oregon for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in 1905. The model {{was moved to the}} Smithsonian National <b>Museum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> (now the Arts and Industries Building) in Washington, D.C. along with other prehistory displays, and to the current National <b>Museum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> building in 1911. Following renovations to the museum in the 2010s, the model was moved once again for display at the Museum of the Earth in Ithaca, New York.|$|E

5|$|Fossils now {{attributed}} to Dimetrodon were first studied by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in the 1870s. Cope had obtained the fossils {{along with those}} of many other Permian tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) from several collectors who had been exploring a group of rocks in Texas called the Red Beds. Among these collectors were Swiss naturalist Jacob Boll, Texas geologist W. F. Cummins, and amateur paleontologist Charles Hazelius Sternberg. Most of Cope's specimens went to the American <b>Museum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> or to the University of Chicago's Walker Museum (most of the Walker fossil collection is now housed in the Field <b>Museum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History).</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1890, Menage {{sponsored}} a scientific {{expedition to the}} Philippines {{in partnership with the}} Minnesota Academy of Natural Sciences. The expedition, led primarily by Dean Conant Worcester and Frank Swift Bourns, collected thousands of specimens of birds and animals; some, such as the Philippine slow loris (Nycticebus menagensis) and the Sulu bleeding-heart (Gallicolumba menagei), were named in honor of Menage.
