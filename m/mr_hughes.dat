50|$|On September 7, 1891, the Los Angeles Board of Education met to, {{among other}} things, select a new board member {{to take the}} place of A.C. Shafer, who had resigned. Seven members of the eight-member board were present, and the first ballot was 3 votes for E.E. Smith, 2 votes for women's activist Caroline Severance and 2 votes for <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hughes.</b> In a second ballot, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hughes</b> {{received}} 4 votes and Smith received 3. Nevertheless, Board President Beal ruled that no election had taken place because the board's rules required five affirmative votes for such a decision, and therefore <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hughes</b> was not seated. The next fortnight <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hughes</b> stayed home and sent an attorney. After hearing a letter from City Attorney Charles H. McFarland that the Hughes appointment was not valid, the board decided by five votes with three abstentions to appoint William W. Hitchcock to Shafer's seat. In October 1891 <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hughes</b> received approval of California Attorney-General William H. H. Hart to file a quo warranto suit against Hitchcock, which would have the effect of ousting him if he could not reply satisfactorily.|$|R

25|$|In 1880 {{the company}} made some trials with a steam tram from Messrs Hughes and Co of Loughborough. On 27 May, at six in the morning, the engine {{was brought to the}} top of Sion Hill outside the general {{cemetery}} where a number of invited guests boarded. The tram proceeded down the steep hill on Derby Road and Chapel Bar to the terminus next to the Exchange. Then the car left the Market Place and made the reverse journey back up the Derby Road hill, stopping to prove that it could start on a steep hill. The tram then proceeded to the Basford Depot and when the flat ground of Radford Road was reached the driver was instructed to increase the speed, and 20 m.p.h. was achieved. The tram reached the Basford Depot in approximately 20 minutes and the trial was judged a success. A further experiment was undertaken on 3 June, to which civic dignitaries including the Mayor, the Town Clerk and various Aldermen were invited, some of whom followed the trial from horse-drawn tram cars. The emission of steam in the Market Place was explained by the manufacturer, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hughes</b> as he had been requested by the authorities to discharge the condensing water outside of the town, so under normal operating conditions, steam would be prevented from escaping in the town.|$|E
