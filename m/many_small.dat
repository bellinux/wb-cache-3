5|$|In the High Middle Ages, {{the county}} was {{relatively}} urbanised by medieval standards, but because towns follow roads and Hertfordshire had <b>many</b> <b>small</b> roads {{rather than a}} few large ones, there was no large conurbation.|$|E
5|$|The Children's Trail lets {{children}} {{get close to}} <b>many</b> <b>small</b> mammals from around the world, including emus, an ocelot, a caracal, siamang gibbons, and golden-mantled tamarins.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenges}} include {{limited access}} to sanitation services, high pollution of water resources, often poor drinking water quality and poor service quality, a fragmentation of executive functions {{at the national level}} among numerous agencies, and a fragmentation of service provision at the local level into <b>many</b> <b>small</b> service providers.|$|E

5|$|The medulla, {{along with}} the spinal cord, {{contains}} <b>many</b> <b>small</b> nuclei involved {{in a wide variety}} of sensory and involuntary motor functions such as vomiting, heart rate and digestive processes.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} {{issue with}} the causeway's identification as a Roman structure {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century was its incorporation of <b>many</b> <b>small</b> bends along its course. Roman military roads are usually straight in both their overall course, and also typically from one vantage point to the next. Both the Foss Way and the Stanegate, roads of established Roman provenance, have sinuous courses similar to Wade's causeway, so the objection is not conclusive.|$|E

5|$|A {{ridge of}} low Jurassic hills {{runs through the}} county, {{separating}} the basins of the Welland and Nene rivers. The county has good communications as it is crossed by two main railway lines and the M1 motorway, and it has <b>many</b> <b>small</b> industrial centres rather than large conurbations. The main architectural feature is its country houses and mansions.|$|E
5|$|Another {{group was}} called Microsauria by Cope in 1868. He {{classified}} Microsauria as a subgroup of Labyrinthodontia, placing <b>many</b> <b>small,</b> amphibian-like animals within it. Among them was Dendrerpeton, once placed in Ganocephala. Dendrerpeton was later placed as a labyrinthodont with other temnospondyls, but confusion existed {{for many years}} over the classification of small amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on fossil}} and {{biological}} evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs, and more specifically, they {{are members of}} Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids, among others. As scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. Recent discoveries in the Liaoning Province of northeast China, which demonstrate <b>many</b> <b>small</b> theropod feathered dinosaurs, contribute to this ambiguity.|$|E

5|$|Bath Township {{is a small}} {{community}} located ten miles (16km) northeast of Lansing, Michigan which contains the unincorporated village of Bath. The area was primarily agricultural in the early 1920s. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, <b>many</b> <b>small</b> one-room schools were closed, where different grades shared the same classroom and teacher. Educators of the era believed that children would receive a better and more complete education if students could attend a single school at one location. The grades could be age-divided into classes, and the facilities could be of a higher quality.|$|E
5|$|Free-fed feral {{cats and}} house cats tend to consume <b>many</b> <b>small</b> meals {{in a single}} day, {{although}} the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured. Although it is not certain, the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.|$|E
5|$|Grilled and barbecued meat {{are common}} in Israeli cuisine. The country has <b>many</b> <b>small</b> eateries specializing in beef and lamb kebab, shish taouk, merguez and shashlik. Outdoor barbecuing, known as mangal or al ha-esh (on the fire) is a beloved Israeli pastime. In modern times, Israel Independence Day is {{frequently}} celebrated with a picnic or barbecue in parks and forests around the country.|$|E

5|$|However, {{languages}} {{differ from}} biological organisms {{in that they}} readily incorporate elements from other languages {{through the process of}} diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, <b>many</b> <b>small</b> languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter {{and the nearby}} Saint-Michel quarter became home to <b>many</b> <b>small</b> jazz clubs, mostly found in cellars {{because of a lack}} of space; these {{included}} the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. They introduced Parisians to the music of Claude Luter, Boris Vian, Sydney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Henri Salvador. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll.|$|E
5|$|Landlords {{generally}} divided their estates {{into smaller}} farms that they rented to tenant farmers. Tenant farmers were generally on one-year leases, {{and could be}} evicted even if they paid their rents. Some of the tenants were large farmers who farmed over , but the majority were much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20km2). <b>Many</b> <b>small</b> farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, {{who worked on the}} land of other farmers. Farmers were an important group politically, having more votes than any other sector of society.|$|E

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>small</b> {{communities}} obtain {{their drinking}} water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step. It {{should be noted}} that unless a high quality source is used, such as secure groundwater, disinfection alone is unlikely to guarantee that drinking water is safe from protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and which require additional removal steps such as filtration.|$|E
5|$|Most impacts in Canada {{occurred}} {{after the hurricane}} transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Cindy brought strong winds and downpours {{along the coast of}} Nova Scotia. <b>Many</b> <b>small</b> vessels sought safety, but the ship Lady Godiva sank near North West Arm; the two people on board were later rescued. No damage was reported on the island itself. In New Brunswick, up to 2 inches (50mm) of rainfall was produced by Cindy, although no damage is known to have been reported.|$|E
5|$|National grids {{are usually}} {{tailored}} towards {{the operation of}} centralised power plants and thus favour their performance. Technologies that do not easily fit into these networks may struggle to enter the market, even if the technology itself is commercially viable. This applies to distributed generation as most grids are not suited to receive electricity from <b>many</b> <b>small</b> sources. Large-scale renewables may also encounter problems if they are sited in areas far from existing grids.|$|E
