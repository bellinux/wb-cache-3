2500|$|Polyploid {{cells and}} organisms are those {{containing}} {{more than two}} paired (homologous) sets of chromosomes. Most species whose cells have nuclei (Eukaryotes) are diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes—one set inherited from each parent. However, polyploidy is found in some organisms and is especially common in plants. In addition, polyploidy occurs in some tissues of animals that are otherwise diploid, such as human muscle tissues. This is known as endopolyploidy. Species whose cells do not have nuclei, that is, Prokaryotes, may be polyploid organisms, {{as seen in the}} large bacterium Epulopiscium fishelsoni [...] Hence ploidy is defined with respect to a cell. Most eukaryotes have diploid somatic cells, but produce haploid gametes (eggs and sperm) by meiosis. A <b>monoploid</b> has only one set of chromosomes, and the term is usually only applied to cells or organisms that are normally diploid. Male bees and other Hymenoptera, for example, are <b>monoploid.</b> Unlike animals, plants and multicellular algae have life cycles with two alternating multicellular generations. The gametophyte generation is haploid, and produces gametes by mitosis, the sporophyte generation is diploid and produces spores by meiosis.|$|E

Factors influencing dihaploid frequencies were studied: genetics of the pollinator effect, genetics of the seed parent effect and interaction between the two effects on dihaploid frequencies. Temperature influences were determined in a growth chamber experiment. The mechanism of dihaploid formation was studied {{with the aid of}} cytological techniques. The pollinator effect was confirmed. Five or more loci were involved and the within-locus interaction was intermediate. High numbers of hybrids had a negative but small effect on numbers of dihaploids. The seed parent effect was also confirmed. The frequency of dihaploids was determined by the sporophyte rather than by the gametophyte of the seed parent. No interaction was found between the pollinator and seed parent effect on the dihaploid frequency. Low temperature had a positive effect on the dihaploid frequency via the pollinator, but no effect was found via the seed parent. Not the 2 n-pollen but the n-pollen proved to be instrumental in dihaploid induction. <b>Monoploids</b> were produced from diploid S. tuberosum and S. verrucosum using several S. phureja genotypes as pollinator. The n-pollen induced the haploids in this case as well. Doubled <b>monoploids</b> were obtained with good female fertility...|$|R

Biotechnological approaches to hasten the process are available including anther culture to halve the genome and protoplast fusion to create hybrids between incompatible partners. We applied these techniques to potato to evaluate their potential for breeding highly heterozygous, cross-pollinating species. Four families of <b>monoploids</b> (2 n= 1 x= 12), developed from diploid hybrids with diverse genomic constitutions but heavily favoring Solanum phureja, a primitive cultivated potato, were used in electrofusion experiments to create intermonoploid somatic hybrids (SH). The “monoploid sieve ” results in the survival of only those gametes free of lethal and deleterious genes but generates sterile sporophytes, necessitating protoplast fusion for SH development. From six intermonoploid electrofusion combinations, 276 plants were regenerated over 6 - 9 months. Fusion conditions were optimized. Ploidy was determined by flow-cytometry and SH confirmed by microsatellite analysis. Field evaluations over three years revealed that intermonoploid SH were inferior to cultivars.

5000|$|In {{some cases}} there is {{evidence}} that the n chromosomes in a haploid set have resulted from duplications of an originally smaller set of chromosomes. This [...] "base" [...] number - the number of apparently originally unique chromosomes in a haploid set - is called the <b>monoploid</b> number, also known as basic or cardinal number, or fundamental number. As an example, the chromosomes of common wheat are believed to be derived from three different ancestral species, each of which had 7 chromosomes in its haploid gametes. The <b>monoploid</b> number is thus 7 and the haploid number is 3 × 7 = 21. In general n is a multiple of x. The somatic cells in a wheat plant have six sets of 7 chromosomes: three sets from the egg and three sets from the sperm which fused to form the plant, giving a total of 42 chromosomes. As a formula, for wheat 2n = 6x = 42, so that the haploid number n is 21 and the <b>monoploid</b> number x is 7. The gametes of common wheat are considered to be haploid, since they contain half the genetic information of somatic cells, but they are not <b>monoploid,</b> as they still contain three complete sets of chromosomes (n = 3x).|$|E
50|$|The common potato (Solanum tuberosum) is {{an example}} of a {{tetraploid}} organism, carrying four sets of chromosomes. The potato plant inherits two sets of 12 chromosomes from the pollen parent, and two sets of 12 chromosomes from the ovule parent. The four sets combined provide a full complement of 48 chromosomes. The haploid number (half of 48) is 24. The <b>monoploid</b> number equals the chromosome number divided by the ploidy level: 48 chromosomes in total divided by a ploidy level of 4 equals a <b>monoploid</b> number of 12.|$|E

50|$|Haploidisation is {{the process}} of halving the {{chromosomal}} content of a cell, creating a haploid cell.

The tribe is subdivided into three subtribes, with one genus, Reynaudia, unplaced (incertae sedis) and probably basal to the other genera. The genus Lecomtella is sometimes included but a study suggested this genus was a distinct clade and best treated as separate tribe, Lecomtelleae.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} on rare occasions for the ploidy to increase in the germline, which can result in polyploid offspring and ultimately polyploid species. This is an important evolutionary mechanism in both plants and animals. As a result, it becomes desirable {{to distinguish between the}} ploidy of a species or variety as it presently breeds and that of an ancestor. The number of chromosomes in the ancestral (non-homologous) set is called the <b>monoploid</b> number (x), and is distinct from the haploid number (n) in the organism as it now reproduces. Both numbers n, and x, apply to every cell of a given organism.|$|E
50|$|Euploidy is {{the state}} of a cell or {{organism}} having one or more than one set of the same set of chromosomes, possibly excluding the sex-determining chromosomes. For example, most human cells have 2 of each of the 23 homologous <b>monoploid</b> chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. A human cell with an extra set out of the 23 normal ones would be considered euploid. Euploid karyotypes would consequentially be a multiple of the haploid number, which in humans is 23. Aneuploidy {{is the state}} where one or more chromosomes of a normal set are missing or present in more than their usual number of copies. Unlike euploidy, aneuploid karyotypes will not be a multiple of the haploid number. In humans, examples of aneuploidy include having a single extra chromosome (such as Down syndrome), or missing a chromosome (such as Turner syndrome). Aneuploid karyotypes are given names with the suffix -somy (rather than -ploidy, used for euploid karyotypes), such as trisomy and monosomy.|$|E
40|$|A three step {{procedure}} for adventitious shoot regeneration on leaf explants of <b>monoploid</b> potato clone H 7322 and a minituber induction procedure on stem segments have been described.

Cytophotometric studies on nuclei of soil grown tubers of tetraploid cv Astarte, of 1 x, 2 x and 4 x adventitious shoots of H 7322, and of diploid H 2578 showed in all cases polyploidization with prominent classes up to 8 C and 16 C. However, nuclei of pith cells of 5 weeks old minitubers which had developed on <b>monoploid</b> H 7322 itself or on 1 x adventitious shoots of H 7322 showed predominantly 1 C and 2 C values. Pith cells of minitubers of <b>monoploid</b> H 7322 were screened, after iodine staining, for the presence of variant cells containing reddish-brown staining (amylose-free) starch. In more than 75 % of the investigated minitubers one or a few of such variant cells were found indicating that such a variation occurs in minitubers of <b>monoploid</b> potato and that this variant character is expressed in cells of vegetative storage organs like potato tubers...|$|E

Additionally, most major genetic mapping and QTL analyses in potato have utilized haploid germplasm to simplify linkage-mapping computations. The accuracy of genetic assumptions concerning the randomness and genetic purity of haploid genomes may directly affect the statistical validity of many results in current potato research. In the present study, AFLP analysis was conducted on two sibling S. phureja ‘BARD 1 - 3 ’ <b>monoploid</b> populations derived by androgenesis in anther culture, and gynogenesis {{through the use of}} a haploid-inducing pollinator, S. phureja ‘IVP 101. ’ Little indication of somaclonal variation and haploid-inducer gene introgression was found in the <b>monoploid</b> band data indicating genomic stability. Segregation of marker alleles that were heterozygous in the parent was distorted from the expected 1 : 1 ratio in both populations, ranging from 35 % in the gynogenic monoploids (GM) to 46 % in the androgenic monoploids (AM). Genetic diversity was more random among the <b>monoploid</b> populations after skewed marker data was removed from phylogenetic analyses. Bilateral and unilateral marker skewness among the monoploids may respectively indicate common and unique segregation distorting loci (SDL) in the haploid genomes.

40|$|AbstractSegment reassortment of {{negative}} strand viruses {{is an important}} mechanism {{for the development of}} new virus strains with altered pathogenicity. This study reports on in vitro generation of reassortants between Andes (ANDV) and Sin Nombre (SNV) viruses. Although they both cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), ANDV is the only hantavirus that has been transmitted from person to person (Enria et al., 1996, Medicina (B Aires) 56, 709; Padula et al., 1998, Virology 241, 323). Following dual infection of cells with ANDV and SNV, 8. 9 % of 337 progeny plaques contained reassortants, of which 66 % were diploid, and 34 % were <b>monoploid.</b> The <b>monoploid</b> reassortants contained the S and L segments of SNV and ANDV M segment. Analysis of replication of the <b>monoploid</b> reassortant indicated its efficiency was similar to ANDV rather than SNV. Results described in this study illustrate the ability to rapidly generate new hantavirus genotypes between genetically unrelated viruses by gene reassortment and provide a tool to dissect the pathogenesis of these important viruses...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria are {{generally}} {{assumed to be}} <b>monoploid</b> (haploid). This assumption is mainly based on generalization of the results obtained with the most intensely studied model bacterium, Escherichia coli (a gamma-proteobacterium), which is <b>monoploid</b> during very slow growth. However, several species of proteobacteria are oligo- or polyploid, respectively. To get a better overview {{of the distribution of}} ploidy levels, genome copy numbers were quantified in four species of three different groups of proteobacteria. A recently developed Real Time PCR approach, which had been used to determine the ploidy levels of halophilic archaea, was optimized for the quantification of genome copy numbers of bacteria. Slow-growing (doubling time 103 minutes) and fast-growing (doubling time 25 minutes) E. coli cultures were used as a positive control. The copy numbers of the origin and terminus region of the chromosome were determined and the results were in excellent agreement with published data. The approach was also used to determine the ploidy levels of Caulobacter crescentus (an alpha-proteobacterium) and Wolinella succinogenes (an epsilon-proteobacterium), both of which are <b>monoploid.</b> In contrast, Pseudomonas putida (a gamma-proteobacterium) contains 20 genome copies and is thus polyploid. A survey of the proteobacteria with experimentally-determined genome copy numbers revealed that only three to four of 11 species are <b>monoploid</b> and thus monoploidy is not typical for proteobacteria. The ploidy level is not conserved within the groups of proteobacteria, and there are no obvious correlations between the ploidy levels with other parameters like genome size, optimal growth temperature or mode of life...|$|E

It is argued that mutation {{as the basis for}} the re-occurrence of wildtype alleles is highly unlikely. The alternative conclusion is reached that the original amylose-free <b>monoploid</b> clone must have been a chimera. Chimerism with wildtype and mutant tissues was actually found in a plant which at a later stage was obtained from the same mutant clone without the use of X-rays.

40|$|Background: Polyploidisation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} mechanisms in the evolution of angiosperms. As in many other genera, formation of polyploids has significantly contributed to diversification and radiation of Knautia (Caprifoliaceae, Dipsacoideae). Comprehensive studies of fine- and broad-scale patterns of ploidy and genome size (GS) variation are, however, still limited to relatively few genera and little is known about the geographic distribution of ploidy levels within these genera. Here, we explore ploidy and GS variation in Knautia based on a near-complete taxonomic and comprehensive geographic sampling. Results: Genome size is a reliable indicator of ploidy level in Knautia, even if <b>monoploid</b> genome downsizing is observed in the polyploid cytotypes. Twenty-four species studied are diploid, 16 tetraploid and two hexaploid, whereas ten species possess two, and two species possess three ploidy levels. Di- and tetraploids are distributed across most of the distribution area of Knautia, while hexaploids were sampled in the Balkan and Iberian Peninsulas and the Alps. Conclusions: We show that the frequency of polyploidisation is unevenly distributed in Knautia both in a geographic and phylogenetic context. <b>Monoploid</b> GS varies considerably among three evolutionary lineages (sections) of Knautia, but also within sections Trichera and Tricheroides, as well as within some of the species. Although the exact causes of this variation remain elusive, we demonstrate that <b>monoploid</b> GS increases significantly towards the limits of the genus’ distribution...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a practical method of breedings corn through the utilization of homozygous lines obtained from the doubling of monoploids will depend upon the obtaining of a reasonably high rate of monoploids from any particular stock, representing desirable gametes for corn production, and on the successful doubling of such monoploids. This study is an investigation of various aspects of these problems. Approximately one hundred twenty thousand individual plants representing the progenies of eighteen crosses of corn were examined for <b>monoploid</b> sporophytes. Monoploids were found to occur at a mean frequency of 0. 82 per thousand seedlings screened. Significant differences {{in the frequency of}} the occurrence of monoploids were found. Delayed pollination and limited agronomic selection did not increase the frequency of monopolidy in the open-pollination variety, Krug, and its derivatives.

40|$|Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is {{a crop of}} {{substantial}} international significance for both food and fuel, however its highly polyploid nature challenges investigation of its genetic composition. Efforts to generate the full sugarcane genome sequence are underway, however in the meantime crop improvement efforts are somewhat limited {{by the lack of}} genome sequence resources available for physiological characterization. Low-coverage survey sequence data was generated and assembled for six sugarcane genotypes representing a range of significant S. spontaneum, S. officinarum, and S. hybrid cultivar accessions from around the world. These data were explored to investigate the composition of repetitive sequences and variations in chloroplast genome sequence, as well as assembled into a conglomerate <b>monoploid</b> genome sequence for polymorphism comparison between the genotypes. Almost half (47 %) of the inter-genomic polymorphisms analysed in these data represented poly-allelic variations which cannot be applied in traditional present/absent marker analysis, suggesting that new approaches are required to better understand and access genetic diversity within the Saccharum genus. These results support previous assertions that S. spontaneum is both less repetitive (62 % repetitive k-mers in Mandalay vs. 65 % in IJ 76 - 514) and more highly polymorphic (17 % poly-alleles in Mandalay vs. 10 % poly-alleles in IJ 76 - 514) than S. officinarum, with S. hybrids being intermediate between the two. However, contrary to previous analysis the <b>monoploid</b> genome size of S. spontaneum does not appear to differ significantly from that of S. officinarum as had been expected.

This paper reviews results obtained in scaling genomic multiples up and down in potato, and relates these manipulations to breeding strategies for the genetic improvement of the cultivated potato. Several ploidy series have been developed, ranging from the <b>monoploid</b> to the hexaploid level. Cultivated tetraploids were scaled down to the diploid and <b>monoploid</b> level by haploidy. Scaling upward was achieved by sexual polyploidisation via 2 n gametes that resulted in triploid, tetraploid, pentaploid, and hexaploid genotypes with a broad genetic base. Altogether, the success of ploidy level manipulations constitutes further proof that sexual polyploidisation {{played an important role in}} the polyploid evolution of Solanum species, and supports the idea that gene flow can be relatively easily accomplished through interploid and bridge crosses...|$|E
