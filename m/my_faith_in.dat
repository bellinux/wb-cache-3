25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, <b>my</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E
500|$|Miller was {{survived by}} his wife, son, daughter, and grandson. Miller married on August 14, 1982. He was quiet and gentle, and was [...] "a modest man, with a self-deprecating sense of humour". Miller {{described}} his own attitude towards music in a 2005 interview: I worked hard to maintain a certain mental and emotional equilibrium. It's mostly due to <b>my</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> the Creator. I don't put all my eggs in that basket of being a rich and famous jazz guy. That allows me {{a certain amount of}} freedom, because I don't have to play music for money. I play music because I love it.|$|E
500|$|The eighth {{track on}} the album is a cover of Bonnie Raitt's [...] "Love Letter" [...] (1989). [...] "The Man with the Child in His Eyes" [...] (1978) was {{described}} as an [...] "ethereal" [...] take on the Kate Bush song. Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone highlighted the original song [...] "5 Minutes Away" [...] as one of Natalie Cole's top ten essential songs, calling it [...] "a wise rumination on love and life accented by dry horns and capped with a rousing call-and-response". The tenth track is the original song [...] "Don't Say Goodnight (It's Time for Love)", written by Cole, Ernie Isley, and Chris Jasper. Cole explained that she included the cover of Des'ree's [...] "You Gotta Be" [...] (1994) as the eleventh song {{on the album}} due to the positive fan response to her prior performances of it; she described it {{as an example of}} her experimentation with [...] "bringing a jazzy flavor to some pop songs". The album concludes with a cover of Sting's [...] "If I Ever Lose <b>My</b> <b>Faith</b> <b>in</b> You" [...] (1993), which emphasizes its spiritual context through the addition of four Beatitudes. An acoustic version of [...] "Lovin' Arms" [...] featuring American blues musician Keb' Mo' was included as a digital bonus track.|$|E

500|$|The poem {{discusses}} {{his understanding}} of nature within the concept of [...] "One Life", an idea that {{is presented as a}} resulting from Coleridge's reflection on his experiences at Clevedon. The conversation poems as a whole are connected to the ideas within The Eolian Harp that deal with understanding the universe. The [...] "One Life" [...] lines added to the 1817 edition interconnect the senses and also connects sensation and experience of the divine with the music of the Aeolian harp. Although the earlier editions do not include the same understanding of perception, there traces of the idea expressed in the earlier editions. Coleridge derived his early understanding from the works of Jakob Böhme, of which he wrote in a 4 July 1817 letter to Ludwig Tieck: [...] "Before my visit to Germany in September, 1798, I had adopted (probably from Behmen's Aurora, which I had conjured over at School) the idea, that Sound was = Light under the praepotence of Gravitation, and Color = Gravitation under the praepotence of Light: and I have never seen reason to change <b>my</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> this respect." [...] Along with this view of sensation, Coleridge adopted Böhme's idea of connecting to God through the will instead of the intellect, and that pantheism should be denied. Coleridge also relies in part on Böhme's understanding of polarity of opposites in his own views of Polar Logic and man's attempt to return to Paradise.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 March 1920, Savarkar {{submitted}} {{his fourth}} mercy petition to the British Government, {{in which he}} stated that [...] "So far from believing in the militant school of the Bukanin type, I do not contribute even to the peaceful and philosophical anarchism of a Kuropatkin [...] or a Tolstoy. And as to my revolutionary tendencies in the past:- {{it is not only}} now for the object of sharing the clemency but years before this have I informed of and written to the Government in my petitions (1918, 1914) about my firm intention to abide by the constitution and stand by it as soon as a beginning was made to frame it by Mr. Montagu. Since that the Reforms and then the Proclamation have only confirmed me in my views and recently I have publicly avowed <b>my</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> and readiness to stand by the side of orderly and constitutional development." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bedridden by illness for {{the last}} two years of his life, Nibley died on 24 February 2005 in his home in Provo, Utah at the age of 94. [...] His son Alex Nibley later edited his World War II memoirs, {{published}} in 2006. [...] He gave the materials for his final book to FARMS in the fall of 2002, which was published in March 2010 as commemoration for what would have been his 100th birthday. [...] Nibley's daughter Martha Beck published Leaving the Saints: How I Lost the Mormons and Found <b>My</b> <b>Faith</b> <b>in</b> 2005, describing her departure from the LDS Church, and claiming in 1990 she had recovered repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse by her father. [...] The allegations received national publicity. Nibley had long been aware of the allegations and denied them. Beck's seven siblings responded saying the accusations were false. Boyd Petersen, Nibley's biographer and son-in-law, also rejected Beck's claims.|$|E
2500|$|Roman Polanski {{gave away}} {{all of his}} {{possessions}} after the murders, unable to bear any reminders of the period that he called [...] "the happiest I ever was in my life". He remained in Los Angeles until the killers were arrested. After, he fled to Europe to evade criminal charges of raping a 13-year-old girl. His 1979 film Tess was dedicated [...] "to Sharon", as Tate had read Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles during her final stay with Polanski in London and had left it for him to read with the comment {{that it would be}} a good story for them to film together. He tried to explain his anguish after the murder of his wife and unborn son in his 1984 autobiography Roman by Polanski, saying [...] "Since Sharon's death, and despite appearances to the contrary, my enjoyment of life has been incomplete. In moments of unbearable personal tragedy some people find solace in religion. In my case the opposite happened. Any religious faith I had was shattered by Sharon's murder. It reinforced <b>my</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> the absurd." ...|$|E

2500|$|IDF {{chief of}} staff (Ramatkal) Shaul Mofaz urged the {{officers}} to speed things up. They asked for twenty-four more hours. Mofaz told reporters that the fighting would be complete {{by the end of}} the week, April 6. In some of the sectors, the forces were advancing at a rate of fifty meters a day. Israeli intelligence assumed that the vast majority of the camp's residents were still in it. Most commanders argued that this obligated a careful advance for fear of striking civilians, and warned that using excessive force would cost the lives of hundreds of Palestinians. Lieutenant Colonel Ofek Buchris, commander of the 51st Battalion, was left in a minority opinion, saying [...] "We're being humiliated here for four days now". When Mofaz instructed the officers to be more aggressive and fire five antitank missiles at every house before entering, one of them contemplated disobedience. Meanwhile, when asked how long he thought his forces could last given the superiority of the Israeli forces, Abu Jandal said: [...] "No. That's not true. We have the weapon of surprise. We have the weapon of honor. We have the divine weapon, the weapon of Allah who stands at our side. We have weapons that are better than theirs. I am the one with the truth, and I put <b>my</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> Allah, while they put their faith in a tank".|$|E

60|$|Mine was no {{uncommon}} experience. I {{had read}} too much positive science and lived too much positive life.
