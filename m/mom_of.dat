Isabella (Alyson Stoner) asks Candace at the Flynn-Fletcher house if Phineas and Ferb are home, but Candace ignores her. Isabella then goes to Phineas with hearts {{in her eyes and}} says her common catchphrase [...] "Whatcha doin'?". She says [...] "Isn't that impossible?" [...] to Phineas and asks him to go swimming with her, but Phineas declines and Isabella leaves. Phineas and Ferb begin working on the coaster.

2500|$|Alexandra, {{the exiled}} Dowager Governess of South Wood, {{is the main}} {{antagonist}} of Wildwood. She is charming and beautiful, and vastly more sophisticated and civilized than her anarchic coyote soldiers she only recently domesticated. In spite of her ruthlessness and murderous intentions, she is a somewhat tragic figure as a grieving mother whose madness is somewhat explained {{by the loss of}} her child. Ellis said, of the illustration of Alexandra holding a knife over Mac, [...] "as a <b>mom</b> <b>of</b> a little kid, just drawing that made my blood run cold." [...] The action of Wildwood is driven by her plot to take revenge on everyone and everything in The Wood, in which she intends to use Prue's brother Mac as a blood sacrifice in a spell to control The Wood's Ivy, which will then grow out of control and consume every living thing in The Wood. The invasive threat of the magical ivy apocalypse that Alexandra plotted in the book is similar to the threat of an [...] "ivy desert" [...] monoculture from invasive English ivy (Hedera helix) in the real Forest Park.|$|E

It has been celebrated every year since. Skenazy also became the host of the reality television show World's Worst Mom on Discovery Life. The 13-episode series features Skenazy visiting extremely anxious parents, including the <b>mom</b> <b>of</b> a 10-year-old who still spoon-fed him, the <b>mom</b> <b>of</b> an 8-year-old who bought him a skateboard but only let him [...] "ride" [...] it on the grass, and the <b>mom</b> <b>of</b> a 13-year-old who still took him into the ladies room. With humor, kindness, and some firmness, Skenazy separated the parents from their children and had the children do some tasks on their own, such as running an errand, or learning, at age 10, how to ride a bike. In the end, 12 of the 13 couples relaxed so much, that they became [...] "Free-Range Parents" [...] themselves. Now Skenazy lectures around the world, including speeches at Microsoft, Audi, The Yale Child Study Center, Wellesley, Barnard, and the Sydney Opera House.|$|E
