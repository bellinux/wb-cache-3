A new series of microwave sweep oscillators has now been designed which incorporates {{a number of new}} conveniences. These oscillators, especially when used with some of the advanced High resolution microwove components developed in the-hplaboratoriesz, make sweep methods more accurate and more than ever. The new sweepers collectively cover the fre-quency range from 1 to 40 gigacycles (kilomegacycles). A major factor in their convenience derives from their use of a p-i-n diode type modulator in the output circuits s of those generators covering the 1 to 12. 4 Gc region. This type of modulator permits the generators to be modulated or leveled with virtually no reaction on the generated carrier frequency, since the voltages and currents in the oscillator tube remain constant. As a result, more accurate frequency specifications are possible in all operating functions...|$|E

40|$|A {{high speed}} quasi-distributed {{demodulation}} method {{based on the}} microwave photonics and the chromatic dispersion effect is designed and implemented for weak fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs). Due {{to the effect of}} dispersion compensation fiber (DCF), FBG wavelength shift leads to the change of the difference frequency signal at the mixer. With the way of crossing <b>microwave</b> <b>sweep</b> cycle, all wavelengths of cascade FBGs can be high speed obtained by measuring the frequencies change. Moreover, through the introduction of Chirp-Z and Hanning window algorithm, the analysis of difference frequency signal is achieved very well.

Therefore, the accuracy of this novel method is greatly improved, and high speed demodulation of FBGs can easily realize. The feasibility and performance are experimentally demonstrated using 105 FBGs with 0. 1 % reflectivity, 1 m spatial interval.

A composite coating {{on the basis of}} a water-based fire-resistant paint filled with shungite nanopowder can be applied onto walls, floors, ceilings and other surfaces in the shielded areas to reduce electromagnetic radiation and simultaneously to ensure fire safety. Shungit is a mineral with multilayer carbon fullerene globules which diameter is 10 – 30 nm. Due to the high conductivity shungite is able to weaken electromagnetic radiation. A coating made of schungite-containing paint on a cellulose substrate was subjected to the open flame under the temperature of 1700 ° C for 3 minutes and 40 seconds.

They have the capability of being used for direct signal reception and ADC at an antenna. A fundamental requirement for these designs is a high-frequency optical pulse train with uniform amplitude and pulse spacing. A mode-locked fiber laser can provide pulse rates and pulse widths suitable for these high bandwidth applications. In this thesis an accurate method for calculating and characterizing with the amplitude and timing jitters of the NPS active mode- locked sigma laser was designed and demonstrated. The method utilizes a wide bandwidth photodetector and a microwave spectrum analyzer to obtain data for analysis. Labview 4. 0 software was used to extract and store the data displayed on the spectrum analyzer.

Results show that the calculation of the laser jitter is not dependent on the upper limit of the noise power integral calculation above 10 kHz; however, the jitter is highly dependent on the value of the lower frequency limit and decreases dramatically as the lower limit is increased. Laser amplitude jitter was found to decrease by 30 % and timing jitter by 0. 85 Ps when the laser was operated with the cw generator instead of the sweep oscillator.

The industrial production of these bacteria {{is carried out}} using known standard biotechnological approaches and equipment. However, the modern requirements to the volumes of their production require {{the development of new}} technologies providing the more intensive growth of bacterial biomass. One of the possible ways to do it is the use of nonspecific stimulators of chemical or physical origin. The stimulating effect of ultrasound on live systems attracts attention of many researchers. Depending on the sonication parameters and conditions, the impact of ultrasound on cell cultures can either stimulate or suppress their life processes. The possibility of the ultrasound stimulation of the biomass accumulation process has been studied for submerged bacterial cultures of Lactococcus lactis VPKM B- 2092, Lactobacillus plantarum VPKM B- 4173, and Propionibacterium acidipropionici VPKM B- 2092. The inoculum with cell contentration of 1 · 108 mL- 1 was sonicated at 880 kHz and energy density varied within 0. 1 - 0. 7 W/cm 3 using a specially designed cuvette, through which the cell suspension was introduced into a fermenter at a rate of 10 mL/s that provided the total sonication time equal to 100 - 120 seconds. As a signal source, a standard therapeutical ultrasound apparatus UZT- 1. 01 F equipped with a <b>sweep</b> <b>generator</b> was used. For all three cultures, the ultrasound stimulation resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} optical density of culture broth comparing to the control and the corresponding increase of the cell concentration. The optimum sonication energy density for the Lactococcus lactis VPKM B- 2092, Lactobacillus plantarum VPKM B- 4173, and Propionibacterium acidipropionici VPKM B- 2092 was equal to 0. 5, 0. 3 - 0. 5 и 0. 3 W/cm 3, respectively. Comparing to the control, the cell count of these strains in the culture broth increased in 28. 6, 9, and 16. 7 times, respectively. Thus, the ultrasound stimulation of inoculum provides a significant increase in the biomass of cells producing lactic and propionic acid that, in turn, increases the economic efficiency of their industrial use.

We also present a detailed calculation of microwave heating from the HFSS parameters and find that 7. 1 % of the incident microwave power contributes to dielectric sample heating. Voltage tunable gyrotron oscillators are proposed as a class of frequency agile microwave sources to generate <b>microwave</b> frequency <b>sweeps</b> required for the frequency modulated cross effect, electron spin inversions, and hyperfine decoupling. Electron spin inversions of stable organic radicals are simulated with SPINEVOLUTION using the inhomogeneous microwave fields calculated by HFSS. We calculate an electron spin inversion efficiency of 56 % at a spinning frequency of 5 kHz. Finally, we demonstrate gyrotron acceleration potentials required to generate swept microwave frequency profiles for the frequency modulated cross effect and electron spin inversions.
