Since the {{purchase}} of the Anvil Hill Coal Mine Xstrata Coal, an Australia-based subsidiary of Xstrata PLC, has come under media scrutiny numerous times in regards to the company's management of the pre-mining stage of the mining project, most notably scrutinised has been the community relations approach of Xstrata Coal towards the local community, with allegations of <b>misleading</b> <b>actions</b> on behalf of the company being cited in the local and regional media, and other regional and local communication channels. This included the setting up of a local action group in opposition to the mine named WAG (Wybong Action Group).|$|E
40|$|A {{deterministic}} learning model {{applied to}} a game with multiple equilibria pro-duces distinct basins of attraction for those equilibria. In symmetric two-by-two games, basins of attraction are invariant {{to a wide range}} of learning rules includ-ing best response dynamics, replicator dynamics, and fictitious play. In this paper, we construct a class of three-by-three symmetric games for which the overlap in the basins of attraction under best response learning and replicator dynamics is arbitrar-ily small. We then derive necessary and sufficient conditions on payoffs for these two learning rules to create basins of attraction with vanishing overlap. The necessary condition requires that pure, uniformly evolutionarily stable strategies are almost never initial best responses. The existence of parasitic or <b>misleading</b> <b>actions</b> allows subtle differences in the learning rules to accumulate...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{complexity}} and system’s theory, {{in this paper}} we try to establish a framework wherein, for the construction of sustainability science, we can legitimaly talk about sustainability. Finding a common ground and shared meanings of the concept of sustainability is, for us, fundamental once, as defined by the German linguist Uwe Poerkse, sustainability too has been converted in what he termed a plastic word. Plastic words have a strong ideological power, but lack a clear meaning. Thus sustainability too has strong positive connotations, but lack each time more a clear denotation and is used to refer to often opposite concepts. To create a sustainability science will only be possible if we manage to give to the concept, within its various contexts and discourses a clear meaning, reducing its ideological connotations to the maximum. It is only in this way that we can reduce the noise which hampers communication, reduces understanding and thus <b>misleads</b> <b>action...</b>|$|R
40|$|Sometimes {{the feeling}} of regret because of haste in making or {{cancelling}} a transaction will cause bad feeling, regret, or guilty feeling. This condition is sometimes used {{by those who have}} stronger position to make certain clauses in a contract which will be favorable for them. Besides that, giving wrong information about an object of a contract will cause the receiver of the information to be wrong in committing himself to a standard contract. Research on khiyar or optional right becomes very important for those who do transaction in a fraudulent contract since they have khiyar (Optional Right) to proceed or to cancel the contract. The research used judicial normative approach which analyzed written laws from literature materials or secondary data and legal references related to khiyar discussed in the research. The data were gathered by conducting library research with documentary study of primary and secondary data so that actual data or comparative data were obtained. A fraudulent contract which can harm one of the parties is a <b>misleading</b> <b>action</b> which intentionally deceives the ignorant partner, either orally or in action; there are also cunning tricks and lies orally and concealing information related to the object of a contract which is intentionally done to conceal the fact about the contract. Therefore, Islamic religion gives the right of akhyar to those who are harmed in the contract in the form of optional right to cancel or to proceed the contract. The parties in dispute because of the fraudulent contract can select reconciliation based on mutual agreement, but they can also select to file a claim to Court to cancel the contract. However, a contract which has fulfilled the requirement will be a valid contract although it is still sinful since it contains fraud in it...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUnfair Commercial Practices Directive {{remains one}} of the most ambitious acts of {{secondary}} legislation adopted in the field of consumer protection over the past decade. This legal instrument seeks to establish a common European understanding of “unfairness” in business-to-consumer legal relations. Hereby Directive introduced a comprehensive regulatory regime applied to all types of commercial activities that can influence the economic behavior of consumers, covering any business-to-consumer commercial practice before, during and after a transaction, thus including marketing, negotiation, sales practices and after-sales conduct. Unfair Commercial Practices Directive into Lithuanian legal system was transposed by adopting a completely new legal act – Law on Prohibition of Unfair Business-to-Consumer Commercial Practices of the Republic of Lithuania. The implementation of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive in Lithuania led to a split-up between misleading business-to-consumer commercial practices and misleading business-to-business advertising regulation regimes. Implementing act among other rules introduced into the national legal system provisions on the prohibition of misleading commercial practices, ensuring that consumers are not misled, thus enabling them to make informed and reasonable choices. The purpose of this article is to examine the norms of national act, implementing the prohibition of misleading commercial practices into the national legal system in the context of implementing provisions of the other Member States and to reveal core national regulation and application problems. Also, having in mind that in the text of the Directive a distinction between <b>misleading</b> <b>actions</b> and misleading omissions is made, it is analyzed whether the clear line between the application of these rules is made in legal practice. In conclusion authors formulate key recommendations for consumer protection institutions and courts, applying the rules on misleading commercial practices...|$|E
40|$|The central {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to investigate whether selected price heuristics are culturally specific or universal. The dissertation?s three experiments explore selected price heuristics in the context of tourism services among samples from the U. S., Korea and China; the U. S. represents an individualist and low context culture, while Korea and China represent collectivist and high context cultures. Study 1 investigated potential tourists? price decisions when confronted with inexpensive functional items (buying a sandwich and a pizza) and an expensive hedonic option (purchasing tickets for a show); in two consuming situations (consuming alone or with another person); in two social group contexts (with an acquaintance or with a family member). The collectivist cultures showed social groups and cultures {{had a significant impact on}} price decisions, although they differed in their reactions when the group was a family member or an acquaintance. Hence, these variables had mixed influence on the U. S. sample?s responses. Study 2 measured the extent to which 9 -ending digits were used in prices by suppliers of five tourism services both within and across the three different cultures represented by New York City, Seoul, and Shanghai. 9 - and 8 -ending prices were dominant in New York City and in Shanghai, respectively, but these culture specific endings were complemented by the universality of the 0 - and 5 -digit endings of prices which were ranked first and second, respectively, in Seoul, second and third in Shanghai, and third and second in New York. Study 3 investigated the relative strength of symbolic meanings of 9 -ending prices (i. e. low quality, enhanced value, discount price, and <b>misleading</b> <b>action)</b> among samples from the U. S., Korea and China, and their effectiveness in influencing tourists' purchases. The analyses found no differences among the three cultures? samples in either their relative importance across cultures, or in the likelihood of tourists selecting 9 -ending rather than even-ending prices when purchasing a sandwich, a pizza or show tickets. In the context of a hotel room, the 9 -ending discount was perceived to be a greater discount than even-ended prices, but its effectiveness could not be explained by the different symbolic meanings associated with 9 -ending prices...|$|R
40|$|Global warming’ {{may be a}} {{familiar}} term, but it is seriously <b>misleading.</b> Human <b>actions</b> are causing a massive disruption to the planet's climate that is severe, rapid, very variable over space and time, and highly complex. The biosphere itself is complex and its responses to even simple changes are difficult to predict in detail. One can likely only be certain that many changes will be unexpected and some unfortunate. Even the simple, slow warming of the climate will produce complex consequences to species numbers and distributions because of how species depend on each other. An alternative approach to worrying about details is to concentrate on understanding the most significant ecological changes, ones that are irreversible — so-called ‘tipping points’. Once such a point has been passed, even if society managed to restore historical climatic conditions, it might not restore the historical ecological patterns. Nowhere is this more obvious than {{in the loss of}} species, for we cannot recreate them. Climate disruptions may cause the loss of a large fraction of the planet's biodiversity, even if the only mechanism were to be species ranges moving uphill as temperatures rise...|$|R

40|$|Fundamental to the successful, {{autonomous}} operation of mobile robots are robust motion control algorithms. Motion control algorithms determine an appropriate action to take {{based on the}} current state of the world. A robot observes the world through sensors, and executes physical actions through actuation mechanisms. Sensors are noisy and can <b>mislead,</b> however, and <b>actions</b> are non-deterministic and thus execute with uncertainty. Furthermore, the trajectories produced by the physical motion devices of mobile robots are complex, which make them difficult to model and treat with traditional control approaches. Thus, to develop motion control algorithms for mobile robots poses a significant challenge, even for simple motion behaviors. As behaviors become more complex, the generation of appropriate control algorithms only becomes more challenging. To develop sophisticated motion behaviors for a dynamically balancing differential drive mobile robot is one target application for this thesis work. Not only are the desired behaviors complex, but prior experiences developing motion behaviors through traditional means for this robot proved to be tedious and demand a high level of expertise. One approach that mitigates many of these challenges is to develop motion control algorithms within a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Here, a behavior is represented as pair...|$|R
40|$|Using {{case studies}} and {{interviews}} with lawyers and representatives in class actions, this article explores the contribution that class actions make to their ostensible beneficiaries. The article first distinguishes the major types of class actions {{in terms of the}} roles of lawyers and class representatives, ranging from very passive representatives to individuals intensively involved with the dispute that gave rise to the litigation. The article next seeks to evaluate the class actions. On the basis {{of the results of the}} class actions, the article finds that class actions cannot be proclaimed major contributors to social change. The focus on results, however, is somewhat <b>misleading.</b> The class <b>action</b> plays a much more significant role through its impact on the parties as litigants and as individuals involved with a dispute. To understand this dimension, which has applications beyond the class action, the article suggests that the dispute transformation perspective should be modified to go beyond the metaphor of a dispute that changes form as it goes through different processes. Disputants in the class action can be thought of as an audience that interprets itself-and is empowered or disempowered-in part by what it learns from watching a legal dramatization of the dispute...|$|R
40|$|International {{headlines}} {{over the}} last few years have been dominated by extreme weather events, and floods have been amongst the most frequent and devastating. These disasters represent high costs and functional disruptions to societies and economies. The consequent breakdown of the economic equilibrium exacerbates the losses of the initial physical damages and generates indirect costs that largely amplify the burden of the total damage. Neglecting indirect damages results in misleading results regarding the real dimensions of the costs and prevents accurate decision-making in flood risk management. To obtain an accurate assessment of total flooding costs, this paper introduces the flood footprint concept, as a novel accounting framework that measures the total economic impact that is directly and indirectly caused to the productive system, triggered by the flooding damages to the productive factors, infrastructure and residential capital. The assessment framework account for the damages in the flooded region as well as in wider economic systems and social networks. The flood footprint builds on previous research on disaster impact analysis based on Input-Output methodology, which considers inter-industry flows of goods and services for economic output. The framework was applied to the 2007 summer floods in the UK to determine the total economic impact in the region of Yorkshire and The Humber. The results suggest that the total economic burden of the floods was approximately 4 % of the region's GVA (£ 2. 7 billion), from which over half comes from knock-on effects during the 14 months that the economy of Yorkshire and The Humber last to recover. This paper is the first to apply the conceptual framework of flood footprint to a real past event, by which it highlights the economic interdependence among industrial sectors. Through such interrelationships, the economic impacts of a flooding event spill over into the entire economic system, and some of the most affected sectors can be those that are not directly damaged. Neglecting the impact of indirect damages would underestimate the total social costs of flooding events, and <b>mislead</b> the correspondent <b>actions</b> for risk management and adaptation...|$|R
