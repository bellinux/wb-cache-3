40|$|Hydrosols {{of silver}} {{nanoparticles}} (AgNPs) prepared {{by reduction of}} AgNO 3 by either NaBH 4 (BH-AgNP hydrosol), or NH 2 OH·HCl (HA-AgNP hydrosol) modified {{by the addition of}} HCl were characterized by SPE spectra (SPE = surface plasmon extinction) and transmission electron microscopy, and their SERS (Surface-enhanced Raman Scattering) activity was tested by measuring the SERS or SERRS (Surface-enhanced Resonance Raman Scattering) spectra of 2, 2 '-bipyridine (bpy) and 5, 10, 15, 20 -Tetrakis(1 -methyl- 4 -pyridinio) - 21 H, 23 H-porphine (H 2 TMPyP) testing adsorbates and by determining of their SERS and SERRS spectral detection limits at λexc = 532 nm. For both types of AgNP hydrosols, {{it was found that the}} addition of HCl and the addition of testing adsorbate leads to an intergrowth of AgNPs and to the formation of their compact aggregates, in combination with the formation of new Ag(0) adsorption sites. The limit of detection in a <b>macrosampling</b> setup was 1 · 10 - 9 M in the system HA-AgNP hydrosol /HCl/bpy and 1 · 10 - 5 M in the system BH AgNP hydrosol/HCl/bpy and, in both causes the Ag(0) -bpy surface complex was detected. About one order of magnitude lower detection limit of bpy in the system with HA-AgNP hydrosol is caused by the efficient intergrowth of AgNP in HA-hydrosol resulting into an efficient formation of "hot [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns the}} structuring of a suitable method {{for the removal}} of oil (Fuel Oil 120 cSt) from traditional bricks and Istrian Stone, materials commonly found amongst embankments and buildings of North Adriatic coastal cities. A cleaning protocol, based upon non-toxic products, was developed in consideration of its compatibility with historical, architectural surfaces. The contamination effects of oil on Istrian stone and fired clay bricks was studied, followed by a range of cleaning treatments using bulk sorbents, surfactant solutions and N,N-dimethyl-octanamide. The application was executed using the products singularly, combined or in succession. The succession of sorbent, solvent and surfactant solution demonstrated good capability of removal and was then applied on <b>macrosamples</b> of brick masonry showing good results...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{specifically}} {{concerned with the}} behaviour of water-repellent mortar specimens and masonry–render systems upon the penetration and crystallization of salt solutions. Portland limestone cement, natural hydraulic lime and Pozzolana lime were admixed with siloxanes and calcium stearates to obtain water-repellent mortars and renders. In order to select the most suitable water-repellent mixtures {{in the presence of}} salt solutions, investigations were carried out upon mono-material mortar specimens and macro-samples (masonry–render systems). Alongside pore structure characterization, the behaviour in connection with water and mechanical properties were determined. In addition, a non-invasive diagnostic methodology is proposed for the study of masonry <b>macrosamples,</b> including thermal imaging, water absorption at low pressure, and sclerometric measurments. The results revealed the difference between the behaviour of the mortar specimens in comparison to the masonry/render systems. Among the mortar specimens, Portland limestone cement mixtures demonstrated better resistance to salt crystallization, whilst those of natural hydraulic lime showed a longer service life, when applied as renders to masonry subjected to rising damp of sodium sulphate solution...|$|R
