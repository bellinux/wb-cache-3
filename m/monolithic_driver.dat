40|$|Experimental {{optimization}} {{of wireless}} protocols and validation of novel solutions is often problematic, due to limited configuration space present in commercial wireless interfaces {{as well as}} complexity of <b>monolithic</b> <b>driver</b> implementation on SDR-based experimentation platforms. To overcome these limitations a novel software architecture is proposed, called WiSHFUL, devised to allow: i) maximal exploitation of radio functionalities available in current radio chips, and ii) clean separation between the logic for optimizing the radio protocols (i. e. radio control) and the definition of these protocols...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{integrated}} {{solution for}} the galvanic isolation between power transistors and their control unit is presented in this paper. This solution {{is based on a}} monolithic integration of a photodetector within a power MOSFET without any modification of its fabrication process. This photoreceiver can be associated with a <b>monolithic</b> <b>driver</b> to drive high side switches. Exhaustive characteristics for several integrated photodetectors are presented and discussed: quantum efficiency, step response, small signal analysis and sensitivity to the High Voltage MOSFET's Drain. The results of this analysis are photoreceivers with a Full Width at Half Maximum above 300 MHz and a responsivity above 0. 15 A/W at a wavelength of 500 nm. This leads to an integrated low power and high bandwidth optical isolation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we propose Violin, a {{virtualization}} framework that allows easy extensions of block-level storage stacks. Violin allows (i) developers to provide new virtualization functions and (ii) storage administrators to combine these functions in storage hierarchies with rich semantics. Violin {{makes it easy}} to develop such new functions by providing support for (i) hierarchy awareness and arbitrary mapping of blocks between virtual devices, (ii) explicit control over both the request and completion path of I/O requests, and (iii) persistent metadata management. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach we evaluate Violin in three ways: (i) We loosely compare the complexity of providing new virtual modules in Violin with the traditional approach of writing <b>monolithic</b> <b>drivers.</b> In many cases, adding new modules is a matter of recompiling existing user-level code that provides the required functionality. (ii) We show how simple modules in Violin can be combined in more complex hierarchies. We demonstrate hierarchies with advanced virtualization semantics that are difficult to implement with <b>monolithic</b> <b>drivers.</b> (iii) We use various benchmarks to examine the overheads introduced by Violin in the common I/O path. We find that Violin modules perform within 10 % of the corresponding <b>monolithic</b> Linux <b>drivers.</b> 1...|$|R
50|$|In <b>monolithic</b> kernels, a <b>driver</b> {{can write}} to any word of memory and thus accidentally corrupt user programs.|$|R
50|$|Device {{drivers and}} kernel {{extensions}} run in kernel space (ring 0 in many CPU architectures), with {{full access to}} the hardware, although some exceptions run in user space, for example filesystems based on FUSE/CUSE, and parts of UIO. The graphics system most people use with Linux does not run within the kernel. Unlike standard <b>monolithic</b> kernels, device <b>drivers</b> are easily configured as modules, and loaded or unloaded while the system is running. Also, unlike standard <b>monolithic</b> kernels, device <b>drivers</b> can be pre-empted under certain conditions; this feature was added to handle hardware interrupts correctly, and to better support symmetric multiprocessing. By choice, the Linux kernel has no binary kernel interface.|$|R
50|$|In <b>monolithic</b> kernels, device <b>drivers</b> {{reside in}} the kernel. Thus, when a new {{peripheral}} is installed, unknown, untrusted code is inserted in the kernel. One bad line of code in a driver can bring down the system.|$|R
40|$|An {{original}} display driver architecture with high-voltage {{driving capability}} and extremely {{low power consumption}} is presented. This new architecture is ideally suited for the <b>monolithic</b> integration of <b>driver</b> circuits for a very wide range of flat panel displays, especially in battery-powered applications...|$|R
50|$|Device drivers obtain kernel {{services}} (such as copying data to users' address spaces) {{by making}} kernel calls. The MINIX 3 kernel {{has a bit}} map for each driver specifying which calls it is authorized to make. In <b>monolithic</b> kernels, every <b>driver</b> can call every kernel function, authorized or not.|$|R
50|$|SkyOS user space lies {{on top of}} a custom, modularized, preemptive-multitasking kernel {{with support}} for common {{features}} like process and thread isolation, memory management/paging, kernel debugging, low-level locking primitives, and real-time PIC/APIC timers. It is a <b>monolithic</b> kernel, with <b>drivers</b> that are dynamically loaded into kernel space via an extension API.|$|R
40|$|APPLICATION NOTE Most PC board mounted relays {{are driven}} by {{microprocessors}} or other sensitive electronic devices. A successful coil drive circuit requires isolation between the relay and the microprocessor circuitry. Effective drive circuits must account for drive current and voltage requirements as well as effective suppression of L di/dt transients which can destroy microprocessor circuits. While {{it is easy to}} over−design an effective drive circuit, today’s designs must be cost competitive. Integrating a <b>monolithic</b> IC <b>driver</b> device into the relay will provide significant value to the system designer. This paper describes the operation of ON Semiconductor’s integrated relay driver products to interface sensitive electronic devices with mechanical relays to accomplish different control/power functions. Important benefits such as PC board space savings and components count reduction are also explained...|$|R
40|$|A {{low cost}} silicon BCD {{technology}} {{in place of}} high cost SOI BCD technology for <b>monolithic</b> integrated EL <b>driver</b> ICs application is put forward. Several key technologies are presented. An advanced SEJTET termination technology was designed instead of the conventional PIOS isolation to obtain smaller chip area and protect HVICs from the occurrence of di/dt effect under PWM operation. Novel VDMOS/Resurf LDPMOS devices were developed compatibly to obtain the lowest Ron,sp, improve silicon utilization, and simplify key process steps...|$|R
40|$|A <b>monolithic</b> {{integrated}} modulator <b>driver</b> with a data {{decision function}} for high-speed optical fiber links is presented. The integrated circuit (IC) was manufactured in a 0. 2 - mu m gate length AlGaAs/InGaAs high electron mobility transistor technology with an fT of 68 GHz.

50|$|The {{fact that}} Linux is a {{monolithic}} kernel {{rather than a}} microkernel was the topic of a debate between Andrew S. Tanenbaum, the creator of MINIX, and Linus Torvalds. The debate, started in 1992 on the Usenet discussion group comp.os.minix, was about Linux and kernel architecture in general. Tanenbaum argued that microkernels are superior to monolithic kernels and that therefore Linux is obsolete. Unlike traditional <b>monolithic</b> kernels, device <b>drivers</b> in Linux are easily configured as loadable kernel modules and are loaded or unloaded while running the system. This subject was revisited on 9 May 2006, and on 12 May 2006 Tanenbaum wrote a position statement.|$|R
40|$|This work {{reports on}} a 600 V GaN-on-Si power {{transistor}} with <b>monolithic</b> integrated gate <b>driver.</b> The circuit is based on Schottky-gate depletion-mode technology and fabricated on a 2 × 3 mm² chip. The push-pull gate driver stage implements a quasi-normally-off pull-up transistor, fabricated with monolithic integrated series-connected Schottky diodes for positive voltage-level shifting in the source path of a d-mode HEMT. The measured gate-source threshold voltage of the fabricated quasi-normally-off pull-up transistor is + 2. 7 V as compared to - 2. 9 V of the normally-on pull-down transistor. Pulsed-IV measurements determine an effective gate driver resistance of around 2. On-wafer measurements of the power transistor show low off-state leakage-currents up to 600 V blocking voltage with high wafer yield and 150 m on-resistance. Finally, inductive-load switching measurements up to 450 V, 14. 3 A show maximum switch node slew-rates during turn-on and turn-off transitions as high as 250 V/ns...|$|R
40|$|Supply modulation, or {{envelope}} tracking (ET), is {{a system}} efficiency improvement technique in radio-frequency (RF) transmitters where a power converter operating as drain supply modulator (DSM) provides an RF power amplifier (RFPA) with time-varying envelope waveforms. DSMs need to have high bandwidth, low tracking error and high efficiency. This thesis focuses {{on the design of}} the DSM using GaN-on-SiC technology for a 20 V ET system with X-band RF transmitter. The signals considered are 20 MHz OFDM and 20 MHz QPSK with 10 W peak output power. The topology chosen is a multi-phase pulse-width modulated (PWM) buck converter. Zero-voltage switching (ZVS) technique is used for high efficiency operation at high switching frequencies. A fourth order output filter design method that supports ZVS operation is proposed to accommodate both high bandwidth and high efficiency. <b>Monolithic</b> gate <b>driver</b> and half-bridge power-stage integration is a key step in addressing challenges in 50 - 100 MHz buck converter design. An analytical loss model is developed and used to optimize the monolithic GaN chips, which are then used to construct high-efficiency, wide-bandwidth synchronous buck converter prototypes implemented as DSMs. The converter prototypes are tested at various duty cycles and output power levels. The loss model and the design optimization results are verified by experimental results. The tradeoffs in multi-phase converter design is also discussed based on a total efficiency optimization method. Several multi-phase converter prototypes are tested, analyzed and compared. The resulting design shows record 97 % efficiency at 10 MHz and 91 % efficiency at 100 ~MHz. Accurate tracking of a 20 MHz LTE (100 RB) envelope signal is demonstrated with 89. 7 % power stage efficiency and 83. 3 % total efficiency. Successful operation of the complete ET transmitter system is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|This VU (volume-unit) meter {{is capable}} of {{monitoring}} and displaying power levels present at the speaker terminals of an stereo audio power amplifier. The levels are displayed in ten discrete steps. This meter is not designed to give an accurate display of the power levels (Kit 73 {{has been designed to}} do this.) It is designed to give an approximate visual indication of the audio power output of each channel. For many situations- disco, parties- this is all which is required: the flashing LED's add atmosphere to the situation. No calibration is required. The kit is constructed on single-sided printed circuit board. It contains two identical circuits, one for each channel of the amplifier. It is based on the LM 3915 IC. Protel Autotrax & Schematic were used to design it. LM 3915. This is a <b>monolithic</b> Dot/Bar Display <b>Driver</b> IC made by National Semiconductor. It takes an analog voltage input on pin 5 then drives 10 LED's providing a logarithmic 3 dB/step analog display. When measuring power, a 3 dB increase means that the power input has doubled. As the power doubles, an additional LED will be lit until the maximum is reached. The display can be bar or moving dot depending on the connection of pin 9 to the positive supply. The LED drive current is regulated which eliminates the need for current limiting resistors. The supply voltage can be between 3 V to 25 V.
