After a 2 -week placebo run-in period, these 2 drugs were compared in a controlled parallel-group study lasting 3 months, involving 53 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (26 assigned to <b>manidipine</b> and 27 to lercanidipine). At the end of the active treatment period, BP was significantly reduced in comparison {{with the end of the}} placebo phase in both the <b>manidipine</b> and the lercanidipine groups, without significant differences between the 2 drugs. Daytime BP was significantly reduced by 5. 5 %/ 5. 6 % with <b>manidipine</b> and by 3. 8 %/ 6. 6 % with lercanidipine, while smaller reductions were seen at nighttime. The smoothness index was the same with both drugs. Unlike lercanidipine, <b>manidipine</b> significantly reduced both basal (- 30 %) and minimal vascular resistance (- 39 %), qualifying it as a potent vasodilator. Despite vasodilation, heart rate was not increased but was even slightly reduced by treatment. Ankle-foot edema was observed with both drugs but was less pronounced with <b>manidipine,</b> probably because of greater postcapillary dilatation.

40|$|This double-blind, multicenter trial {{compared}} antihypertensive efficacy, tolerability, {{and impact}} on {{quality of life}} of <b>manidipine</b> and amlodipine in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Patients were randomly assigned to 48 weeks of once-daily <b>manidipine,</b> 10 - 20 mg, or amlodipine, 5 - 10 mg. Patients who did not respond to treatment after 12 weeks were also given enalapril, 10 - 20 mg, for the study's duration. The main efficacy end point was equivalence in sitting systolic (SiSBP) and diastolic (SiDBP) blood pressure reduction between the two drugs after 8 weeks (per protocol analysis). An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed in all patients with at least one efficacy determination during treatment. Quality of life was assessed by the "Subjective Symptoms Assessment Profile" (SSA-P) and "General Well-being Schedule" (GWBS), after 12 weeks of treatment. SiSBP reduction after 8 weeks was equivalent for <b>manidipine</b> (15. 2 mm Hg, n = 227) and amlodipine (17. 0 mm Hg, n = 219). The corresponding figure for SiDBP was 11. 3 mm Hg for <b>manidipine</b> and 12. 3 mm Hg for amlodipine. In the larger ITT population SiDBP was similarly and significantly reduced by <b>manidipine</b> (from 102 +/- 5 to 88 +/- 9 mm Hg, n = 241) and amlodipine (from 101 +/- 5 to 87 +/- 8 mm Hg, n = 240). Similar results were observed for SiSBP and standing SBP and DBP. Neither drug changed sitting or standing heart rate compared with baseline. SSA-P scores improved with <b>manidipine</b> but not amlodipine. GWBS total and partial scores increased more with <b>manidipine</b> than with amlodipine.

The preparation showed the well-known biphasic response to KCl-induced depolarization. All three calcium antagonists were more potent in inhibiting the second phase (tonic) compared with the first phase (transient) of the effect. The inhibitory concentration of 50 % (pIC 50) values were 6. 92 +/- 0. 24 / 8. 51 +/- 0. 08 (nifedipine, n = 32), 7. 61 +/- 0. 10 / 9. 33 +/- 0. 03 (nisoldipine, n = 28), and 7. 61 +/- 0. 13 / 9. 07 +/- 0. 06 (<b>manidipine,</b> n = 32) for {{the suppression of the}} first and second phases, respectively. In small coronary and renal arteries maximally activated with KCl solution, nifedipine and <b>manidipine</b> concentrations dependently inhibited the calcium concentration response curves. <b>Manidipine</b> was more potent than nifedipine (pIC 50 coronary artery: 9. 26 +/- 0. 14 vs 7. 93 +/- 0. 22; pIC 50 renal artery: 9. 14 +/- 0. 14 vs 7. 77 +/- 0. 21), but both compounds showed the same potency in the two different preparations.

Fourteen-week-old male SHR and age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats were left untreated (control groups). Four additional groups of 14 -week-old SHR were treated for 12 weeks with daily oral doses of 2. 5 mg/kg lercanidipine, 5 mg/kg <b>manidipine,</b> 3 mg/kg nicardipine, or 10 mg/kg hydralazine. These treatments decreased systolic blood pressure values to a similar extent in SHR. Signs of glomerular injury, as characterized by glomerulosclerosis, hypertrophy, and an increased number of mesangial cells, were observed in control SHR. The treatment with CAs improved glomerular morphology and decreased the number of mesangial cells.

40|$|Oxidative stress (OxSt) {{is a major}} {{damaging}} {{factor in}} arterial hypertension and its long-term complications. This is why considerable {{attention is paid to}} the possible effects of antihypertensive drugs on OxSt. <b>Manidipine</b> is a dihydropiridine calcium channel blocker with reported nephroprotective activities, but no information is available on its effect on OxSt and related mechanisms. This study assessed the effect of <b>manidipine</b> on normal subjects' monocyte gene and protein expression of OxSt-related proteins such as p 22 (phox), a NAD(P) H oxidase system subunit, critical in generating O 2 -, and heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), induced by and protective from OxSt, and compared <b>manidipine</b> with the ACE inhibitor captopril and the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, in the presence and absence of sodium arsenite (NaAsO 2) as an inducer of OxSt. Co-incubation of <b>manidipine</b> with NaAsO 2 dose-dependently decreased p 22 (phox) mRNA production from basal: 0. 87 +/- 0. 1 d. u., 0. 69 +/- 0. 06 and 0. 66 +/- 0. 09 at 100, 300 and 500 nM respectively versus 0. 99 +/- 0. 2, P < 0. 04, while HO- 1 mRNA production was increased by the same concentrations of the drug: 0. 87 +/- 0. 1 d. u., 0. 92 +/- 0. 1, 0. 98 +/- 0. 1 respectively versus 0. 63 +/- 0. 07; P < 0. 03.

40|$|Background and objective: Isolated {{systolic}} hypertension (ISH) affects 10 - 20 % of {{the elderly}} population and is strongly related {{to the risk of}} cardiovascular events. Elevated systolic BP values are primarily caused by reduced large vessel compliance with a consequent increase in total peripheral resistance. Vasodilating drugs, such as calcium channel antagonists, have proven to be effective in controlling ISH in elderly patients. This study set out to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of two different calcium channel antagonists, <b>manidipine</b> and amlodipine, administered once daily in elderly subjects with ISH. Methods: In a European, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group study, after a 2 -week placebo run-in period, 195 patients aged ≥ 60 years with ISH received <b>manidipine</b> 10 - 20 mg once daily or amlodipine 5 - 10 mg once daily. Chlortalidone 25 mg once daily could be added to the high dose of test drug in the event of insufficient antihypertensive control. The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of patients with a reduction in office sitting systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 15 mm Hg, measured at trough, at the final visit. Secondary efficacy parameters included: the proportion of patients with a normal sitting SBP value (< 140 mm Hg) at the final visit; a change from baseline to the final visit in mean office trough sitting SBP; a change from baseline to the final visit in the cardiovascular risk score as measured by the INDANA (INdividual Data ANalysis of Antihypertensive intervention trials) project score; the proportion of patients with at least a two-point reduction in the cardiovascular risk score; the percentage of patients requiring upward dose titration and diuretic add-on treatment and the investigator's final judgement. Safety and tolerability evaluations were based on adverse events, ECG and laboratory tests, and clinically relevant reports of abnormalities. Results: In the intention-to-treat population (n = 189), 76 % and 72 % of patients in the <b>manidipine</b> and amlodipine groups, respectively, had a reduction in sitting SBP of ≥ 15 mm Hg (p-value not significant for between-group comparison). The percentage of patients with a normal sitting SBP value was 52 % in the <b>manidipine</b> group and 51 % in the amlodipine group (p-value not significant for between-group comparison). Sitting SBP reductions at the end of treatment were - 19. 5 ± 11. 8 mm Hg in patients receiving <b>manidipine</b> and - 18. 4 ± 11. 1 mm Hg in patients receiving amlodipine. Both treatments induced a small reduction in cardiovascular risk score, with 45 % of patients in both treatment groups having a two-point reduction in the final score. At the final visit, approximately half of the patients in both treatment groups were still being treated with the low dose of one of the test drugs (<b>manidipine</b> 10 mg or amlodipine 5 mg).

Untreated age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats {{were used as}} a reference group. Compounds investigated decreased to a similar extent systolic pressure in SHRs. Increased cardiocyte size (hypertrophy), development of necrosis and fibrosis areas, and increased thickness of coronary arteries with luminal narrowing were observed in control SHRs. Pharmacologic treatment countered hypertension-dependent left ventricle and coronary artery changes in SHRs. <b>Manidipine,</b> amlodipine, and lercanidipine displayed a similar activity, whereas nifedipine and isradipine were less potent. These findings support observations that antihypertensive treatment counters hypertension-related left ventricle and coronary changes. The observation of a different effect of Ca 2 + antagonists tested suggests {{the possibility of a}} more favorable cardiac profile exerted by some dihydropyridines. The evaluation of specific properties of dihydropyridines on hypertensive end-organ damage may contribute to better choices depending on clinical situations...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease {{management}} and prevention represent the leading cost driver in Italian healthcare expenditure. In {{order to reach}} the target blood pressure, {{a large majority of}} patients require simultaneous administration of multiple antihypertensive agents. OBJECTIVE: To assess the economic impact of the use of fixed dose combinations of antihypertensive agents, compared to the extemporary combination of the same principles. METHODS: A cost minimization analysis was conducted to determine the pharmaceutical daily cost of five fixed dose combinations (olmesartan 20 mg + amlodipine 5 mg, perindopril 5 mg + amlodipine 5 mg, enalapril 20 mg + lercanidipine 10 mg, felodipine 5 mg + ramipril 5 mg, and delapril 30 mg + <b>manidipine</b> 10 mg) compared with extemporary combination of the same principles in the perspective of the Italian NHS. Daily acquisition costs are estimated based on current Italian prices and tariffs. RESULTS: In three cases the use of fixed‑dose combination instead of extemporary combination induces a lower daily cost. Fixed combination treatment with delapril 30 mg + <b>manidipine</b> 10 mg induces greater cost savings for the National Health System (95, 47 €/pts/year), as compared to free drugs combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with free drug combinations, fixed‑dose combinations of antihypertensive agents are associated with lower daily National Health Service acquisition costs. [URL] </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hypertension {{markedly}} {{increases the}} already {{high risk for}} cardiovascular complications in patients with diabetes mellitus. Less than one in eight patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes have adequately controlled blood pressure. As a result, antihypertensive combinations are now widely used in management of hypertension associated with diabetes. METHODS: This double-blind study investigated efficacy of a new fixed dose combination of a calcium antagonist, <b>manidipine</b> 10 mg, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, delapril 30 mg, compared {{with a combination of}} an angiotensin receptor blocker, losartan 50 mg, and a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide 12. 5 mg. Patients with hypertension (blood pressure > or = 130 / 80 mmHg) with controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA 1 c < or = 7. 5 %) were randomized to manidipine/delapril (n = 153) or losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (n = 161), administered once daily for 12 weeks. Patients underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitor evaluation at baseline and end of treatment. RESULTS: Mean decreases in 24 -h systolic blood pressure were seen with both manidipine/delapril (- 9. 3 mmHg) and losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (- 10. 7 mmHg) combinations. The mean (95 % confidence interval) treatment difference was - 1. 4 (- 4. 5 / 1. 8) mmHg, demonstrating noninferiority of the manidipine/delapril combination. Reduction in 24 -h diastolic blood pressure (- 4. 6 versus - 4. 5 mmHg) and daytime (systolic blood pressure - 10. 5 versus - 11. 1 mmHg) and night-time (systolic blood pressure - 7. 1 versus - 9. 3 mmHg) blood pressure were also not significantly different between treatments.

40|$|Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is {{a potent}} {{endogenous}} vasodilator in humans, and {{has been reported to}} be localized in peripheral nerve fibers distributed in the cardiovas-cular system. Thus, CGRP is considered as a modulator of peripheral vascular tone. In this study, in order to investigate the pathophysiological role of CGRP in hypertensive dis-eases, plasma CGRP levels (pCGRP) were evaluated in patients with essential hypertension (EHT, n= 31; WHO I-II), primary aldosteronism (PA, n= 13), pheochromocytoma (Pheo, n= 4) and nor-motensive subjects (Control, n= 25), using a sensitive radioimmunoassay previously established in our laboratory. The effects of chronic treatment with Ca?? antagonist (<b>manidipine</b> 20 mg/day) or α?-blocker (bunazosin 3 mg/day) on pCGRP were studied in 11 cases of EHT. pCGRP were also measured after adrenalectomy in 5 cases of PA. EHT showed significantly higher pCGRP compared with Control. Significant positive correla-tions were observed between both systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pCGRP in the combined group of EHT and Control. In 6 EHT, pCGRP decreased significantly after 2 weeks administration of <b>manidipine</b> simultaneously with a marked blood pressure fall. A significant decrease of pCGRP was also observed after 2 weeks treatment with bunazosin in 5 EHT. In secondary hypertension, in spite of their clear differences in humoral factors such as plasma renin activity, plasma cate-cholamine level or plasma aldosterone concentration, both PA and Pheo showed significantly higher pCGRP compared with Control. No significant difference in pCGRP was observed among EHT, PA and Pheo. pCGRP markedly decreased after adrenalectomy accompanied with a significant fall hi blood pressure in PA. Thus, it was suggested in this study that the increased pCGRP observed in EHT, PA and Pheo are a secondary, compensatory reaction to elevated blood pressure...|$|E

40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) is an intricate network composed of {{an array of}} macromolecules capable of regulating the functional responsiveness of cells. Its composition greatly varies among different types of tissue, and dysregulation of its metabolism may contribute to vascular remodeling during the pathogenesis of various diseases, including atherosclerosis. In view of their antiatherosclerotic effects, the role of Ca 2 + channel blockers in the metabolism of ECM was examined. Nanomolar concentrations of the five Ca 2 + channel blockers amlodipine, felodipine, <b>manidipine,</b> verapamil, or diltiazem significantly decreased both the constitutive and platelet-derived growth factor BB-dependent collagen deposition in the ECM formed by human vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. The drugs inhibited the expression of fibrillar collagens type I and III and of basement membrane type IV collagen.

According to Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, initial components were not chemically modified during microencapsulation. X-ray diffraction patterns and differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated that this process led to drug amorphization. In vitro dissolution studies showed that all microparticles prolonged MAN release, mainly which one obtained using PCL that contained 5 % of drug loaded (PCL-M 5). Animal studies demonstrated that formulation PCL-M 5 {{was able to keep}} the variation of mean arterial pressure after phenylephrine administration up to 24 hours.

40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{potency of}} angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (lisinopril and enalaprilat) on the transcription of low density lipoprotein receptor and 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA reductase genes was examined in human vascular smooth muscle cells and {{compared with the}} action of Ca(2 +) -channel blockers (<b>manidipine,</b> verapamil, and diltiazem). Analogous to Ca(2 +) -channel blockers, nanomolar concentrations of enalaprilat or lisinopril stimulated the synthesis of low density lipoprotein receptor mRNA and amplified the transcription induced by recombinant platelet-derived growth factor BB. In contrast to Ca(2 +) -channel blockers, ACE inhibitors did not alter the transcription of the 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA reductase gene. Platelet-derived growth factor BB stimulated the translocation of delta and epsilon isoforms of protein kinase C. Similar to Ca(2 +) -channel blockers, ACE inhibitors reduced the translocation of delta and epsilon isoforms of protein kinase C. Furthermore, ACE inhibitors and Ca(2 +) -channel blockers inhibited platelet-derived growth factor BB-induced transcription of c-fos and c-jun genes.

All samples were analyzed by a liquid chromatography (LC) method. Under these conditions, a significant linear relationship between the absorbed (calculated by deconvolution approach) and dissolved fractions of MAN was obtained (R= 0. 997) and an in vivo-in vitro (IVIV) correlation for this particular formulation containing MAN can be established. Validation parameters for dissolution methodology such as the specificity, linearity, accuracy and precision were also evaluated {{according to the international}} guidelines, giving results within the acceptable range. Therefore, the proposed dissolution conditions can be applied for the simultaneous release analysis of DEL and MAN from the solid dosage form, contributing to the improvement of the quality control of pharmaceutics and minimizing the number of bioavailability studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} {{interaction}} between calcium channel antagonists and grapefruit juice varies widely among drugs. Coadministration of calcium channel antagonists with grapefruit juice can elevate the bioavailability of drugs and alter pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug. A calcium channel antagonist with lower bioavailability {{is likely to be}} more affect-ed by grapefruit juice. The area under the concentration-time curve and peak serum con-centrations of azelnidipine, efonidipine, felodipine, <b>manidipine,</b> nicardipine, nifedipine, nisoldipine, nitrendipine and verapamil are influenced by grapefruit juice. Conversely, pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine and diltiazem are not affected by grapefruit juice. The action of grapefruit juice is rapid, and a single exposure to one glass of juice can usually produce a significant interaction. Furanocoumarins primarily contribute to grapefruit juice-drug interactions in humans. Cytochrome P 4503 A 4 and P-glycoprotein may act in tandem as a barrier to oral delivery of drugs. The main mechanism for en-hanced bioavailability of drugs by grapefruit juice is, presumably, the inhibition of cyto-chrome P 4503 A 4 in the small intestine and only to a minor extent affected by P-glycopro-tein function.

Fourteen-week-old SHR were treated for 12 weeks with a nonhypotensive dose of lercanidipine or with equihypotensive doses of lercanidipine, <b>manidipine,</b> nicardipine, and hydralazine. In control SHR, systolic pressure values were significantly higher in comparison with Wistar-Kyoto rats. Treatment with the low dose of lercanidipine did not reduce systolic blood pressure in SHR, whereas the higher dose of lercanidipine or other compounds tested significantly decreased systolic pressure values. Glomerular hypertrophy accompanied by signs of glomerulosclerosis, increase of mesangial cells, and convoluted tubules degeneration were observed in control SHR. Hypotensive doses of Ca(2 +) antagonists countered glomerular injury, the increase of mesangial cells, the reduction of capsular space, and tubular degeneration. Hydralazine, {{in spite of its}} hypotensive activity, displayed a slight nephroprotective action. The nonhypotensive dose of lercanidipine countered in part glomerular injury, narrowing of capsular space, and tubular degeneration, and decreased mesangial cell augmentation in SHR. These results suggest that treatment with dihydropyridine-type Ca(+ 2) antagonists counters hypertensive glomerular and tubular changes occurring in SHR.

Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) {{were used as}} normotensive references group. Treatment of animals with oral equi-hypotensive doses of the above compounds started at 14 weeks of age and lasted for 12 weeks. Microanatomical analysis was extended to samples of frontal cortex and occipital cortex used as reference tissue. Different compounds investigated decreased to a similar extent systolic blood pressure values {{with the exception of}} nimodipine that in spite of the high dose used exerted a less pronounced hypotensive activity. Morphological changes including reduced thickness of retina and of inner plexiform, outer nuclear and layer of inner and outer segments plus outer limiting layer, and loss of ganglionic neurons were observed. GFAP-immunoreactive astrocyte hypertrophy was also found in control SHR. These phenomena were countered by treatment by treatment with dihydropyridine-type Ca 2 + antagonists {{and to a lesser extent}} by hydralazine. The different Ca 2 + antagonists tested exerted a similar protective effect on retinal, but not on brain neurons. The sensitivity of retina and cerebral cortex to anti-hypertensive treatment may be related to a different density of L-type Ca 2 + channels in structures investigated or to kinetic reasons.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Many adults {{take some}} form of {{medication}} to treat chronic conditions, however {{little is known about}} their effects on embryogenesis and pregnancy. With the increase in fertility problems society is facing and the increase in use of medications, {{it is important to understand}} what effects pharmaceuticals have on the developing embryo to ensure that future generations are not adversely affected by teratogenic compounds that can lead to birth defects. In this study, teratogenicity of anti-diabetic compounds was examined using the in vitro P 19 C 5 embryoid body (EB) elongation morphogenesis model. As the EB model recapitulates key embryological events crucial for body patterning and axis formation, adverse impact of drugs on EB growth and elongation implicates their potential teratogenicity. Of the 31 anti-diabetic compounds examined, 27 decreased EB size and 11 either decreased or increased EB elongation at a given concentration. Morphogenetic impact of four specific anti-diabetic drugs, dapagliflozin, phenformin HCl, <b>manidipine</b> 2 HCl, and resveratrol, was further examined by investigating expression patterns of key developmental regulators. Each drug exhibited a unique effect on gene expression patterns. Notably, dapagliflozin significantly reduced the level of the Wnt 3 gene, a crucial regulator of the primitive streak formation. The Wnt-inhibiting effect of dapagliflozin was also confirmed by the TOPFLASH reporter assay. Furthermore, it was revealed that the drug impact on EB size was likely mediated by adverse effect on cell proliferation. These results suggest that anti-diabetic compounds impact EB morphogenesis by perturbing key developmental regulators, cellular signaling, and proliferation. The present research should lay the foundation for further investigations, including animal and human studies, to determine teratogenicity of specific anti-diabetes medications...|$|E

Study design: This was a multicentre open study, with a two-week placebo run-in period, followed by a 50 -week active treatment period. Three hundred and nine patients with a mean age of 56. 4 years and a sitting (Si) diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥ 95 mm Hg and ≤ 110 mm Hg were enrolled. During the treatment period systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP were assessed by conventional sphygmomanometry. Results: The decreases in SiSBP and SiDBP were clinically relevant after 4 weeks of treatment, with a mean reduction of 16. 6 mm Hg (95 % confidence interval [CI] - 18. 2; - 15) and 9. 3 mm Hg (95 % CI - 10. 2; - 8. 4), respectively. At the end of treatment, SiSBP and SiDBP were significantly decreased by 21. 8 mm Hg [95 % CI - 23. 4; - 20. 2) and 14. 3 mm Hg (95 % CI - 15. 3; - 13. 4), respectively. Pulse pressure (PP) was 61. 4 ± 9. 8 mm Hg at baseline and was reduced to 54. 2 ± 10. 8 mm Hg after the first month of treatment (- 7. 3 mm Hg, 95 % CI - 8. 5; - 6); at 50 weeks of treatment the PP was 54 ± 11 mm Hg (- 7. 5 mm Hg, 95 % CI - 8. 8; - 6. 1). The success rate (reduction of SiDBP ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline or SiDBP ≤ 90 mm Hg) was 86. 4 %, the normalisation rate (SiDBP ≤ 90 mm Hg) was 80. 6 %. Forty-four patients (14. 2 %) reported adverse drug-related events. No clinically significant changes in heart rate, ECG or laboratory tests were found. Conclusion: The fixed combination M+D is effective in reducing blood pressure levels in patients with hypertension and in maintaining the reduction throughout the study period, with a good tolerability profile...|$|E
