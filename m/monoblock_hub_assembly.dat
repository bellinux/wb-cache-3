The analysis model is composed of a part of material defined by two artificial planes of symmetry, which is to reduce computational time taken in simulating the holistic process. Three cases of 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° analysis models for simulating rotary forging processes are studied to validate the present {{finite element analysis}} model. The predictions at their planes of symmetry and mid-planes are investigated and compared with the experiments, revealing that the predictions at the mid-planes are in good agreement with the experiments for all the cases while those at the planes of symmetry are to the contrary.

Lattice formation occurs spontaneously in vitro at low pH and, intracellularly, is triggered by adaptors at physiological pH. To {{begin to understand}} the cellular regulation of clathrin polymerization, we analyzed molecular interactions during the spontaneous <b>assembly</b> of recombinant <b>hub</b> fragments of the clathrin heavy chain, which bind clathrin light-chain subunits and mimic the self-assembly of intact clathrin. Reconstitution of hubs using deletion and substitution mutants of the light-chain subunits revealed that the pH dependence of clathrin self-assembly is controlled by only three acidic residues in the clathrin light-chain subunits. Salt inhibition of <b>hub</b> <b>assembly</b> identified two classes of salt bridges which are involved and deletion analysis mapped the clathrin heavy-chain regions participating in their formation. These combined observations indicated that the negatively charged regulatory residues, identified in the light-chain subunits, inhibit the formation of high-affinity salt bridges which would otherwise induce clathrin heavy chains to assemble at physiological pH. In the presence of light chains, clathrin self-assembly depends on salt bridges that form only at low pH, but is exquisitely sensitive to regulation. We propose that cellular clathrin assembly is controlled via the simple biochemical mechanism of reversing the inhibitory effect of the light-chain regulatory sequence, thereby promoting high-affinity salt bridge formation...|$|R

The hub and tailshaft is a one piece partially forged part which is carburized, heat treated and machined. A single row ball bearing restrains {{each of the eight}} blades in the hub, while the tailshaft secures the propeller to the engine shaft with two cone seats that are preloaded against each other by the Prop-fan retaining nut.

The single row ball bearing retention provides ease of maintenance by allowing individual blade replacement without dissassembly of the hub. It has a through hardened inner race which seats against the aluminum blade shank and an outer race which is integral with the barrel. The outer race area is carburized to achieve the hardness necessary to support the ball loads. The balls are kept from contact with each other by a separator.

40|$|Products of two {{bacteriophage}} T 4 D genes, 26 and 51, both {{known to}} be essential {{for the formation of}} the central hub of the phage tail baseplate, have been partially characterized chemically, and their biological role has been examined. The gene 26 product was found to be a protein with a molecular size of 41, 000 daltons and the gene 51 product a protein of 16, 500 daltons. The earlier proposal (L. M. Kozloff and J. Zorzopulos, J. Virol. 40 : 635 - 644), from observations of a 40, 000 -dalton protein in labeled hubs, that the gene 26 product is a structural component of the baseplate, has been confirmed. The gene 51 product, not yet detected in phage particles, appears from indirect evidence also to be a structural component of the baseplate hub. These current conclusions about the gene 26 and 51 products are based on properties of T 4 mutant particles containing altered gene 26 or 51 products and include (i) changes in heat lability, (ii) changes in adsorption rates, and (iii) changes in plating efficiencies on different hosts, and with the results of previous isotope incorporation experiments indicate that T 4 particles contain three copies of the gene 26 product and possibly one or at most two copies of the gene 51 product. Properties of these mutant particles indicate that the gene 26 product, together with the other hub components such as the gene 28 product, plays a critical role in phage DNA injection into the host cell, whereas the 51 product seems essential in initiating baseplate <b>hub</b> <b>assembly...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{brake disc}} rotor forms pan of a {{foundation}} brake and rotates with the wheel <b>hub</b> <b>assembly.</b> The main {{function of a}} foundation brake is to generate a retarding torque by converting mechanical energy to thermal energy {{by virtue of the}} frictional work done in relative sliding at the rotor-pad interface. In practice, most brake discs arc made from cast iron and in use arc sometimes subjected to high thermal stresses which can lead to permanent plastic deformation and occasionally rotor cracking. The aim of the present work is to investigate the thermal response of such a cast iron brake disc using the finite element (FE) method. One particular existing brake disc design for a medium passenger car was chosen for the investigation. This is a "back-vented" disc designed to minimise disc coning but the present work also includes an investigation of a conventional "frontvented" disc similar in dimension to the back-vented disc but with different detailed geometry. Experimental work was undertaken to derive the rotor material properties in tension and compression as a function of temperature. This data was used to generate suitable FE material model routines which accurately allow for the different temperature-dependent yield properties of cast iron in tension and compression. The modelling work highlights the role of the rotor geometry in controlling the thermal response of the structure but. more importantly, the necessity for an accurate material model is illustrated, particularly with regard to its ability to predict the accumulation of plastic strain which may lead to rotor cracking. Using the most accurate user developed material subroutine, the thermal response of the back-and front-vented disc designs are compared: the back-vented disc suffers lower thermal distortion but at the expense of higher plastic strain accumulation, particularly near the point of attachment of the vanes...|$|R

The wind turbine operates in turbulent windy atmosphere and experiences {{a wide range of}} dynamic loads. Flexible rotor blade and tower adopted requires design consideration {{to keep them out of}} resonance regime. The indigenously developed teetered two bladed downwind turbine has rotor of 45 m diameter placed at the top of 60 m tubular tower with four guy rope support. The modal analysis of the rotor, two blades and <b>hub</b> <b>assembly,</b> was performed with hinged boundary condition at the teeter axis. Modal frequencies of the parked rotor predicted would be used in conjunction with experimental data for validation of the FE model and that of spinning rotor for design. Tower modal frequencies were obtained using tapered beam elements for the tower and a lumped mass for the tower top mass. Guy rope stiffness was estimated using load elongation data obtained on a test specimen and the same was included as spring in the FE model. Campbell diagram were drawn for the rotor and the tower and the risk of resonance build-up by the potential excitations of rotor harmonics was explored. The Campbell diagrams indicated that the tower and rotor natural frequencies were well separated from the potential rotor excitations. Dynamic load monitored on the tower using strain gauge and the visible observation of rotor teeter at low wind speed during the run of prototype reinforces the results of the modal analysis. However dynamic loads during transients of wind turbine operation needs to be monitored and investigated for further improvement towards the smooth operation of the wind turbine as the first prototype was yet to be configured with yaw and teeter dampers...|$|R
40|$|The {{helicopter}} tail shake {{phenomenon is}} an area of great concern to helicopter manufacturers as it adversely affects the overall performance and handling qualities of the helicopter, and the comfort of its occupants. This study is intended to improve the understanding of the unsteady aerodynamic load characteristics triggered by the helicopter main-rotor-hub assembly wake that lead to this phenomenon by experimental and numerical investigations. In this research work, a simplified NASA standard fuselage model was mated to a main-rotor-hub assembly from a remote-control helicopter. Data of pressures and velocities inside the wake, as well as the aerodynamic drag, corresponding to the variations of helicopter’s advance ratios and pylon configurations were captured. This work had gained some useful information towards further understanding of this long running issue, with a potential to minimise the problem. The dynamic analysis, through the power spectral density, root-mean-square and probability density function analyses, was also conducted and had successfully quantified the frequency and unsteadiness of mainrotor- <b>hub</b> <b>assembly</b> wake. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) had also been carried out to model and simulate the wake dynamics, and were successfully validated using experimental results. The Sliding Mesh method was opted to simulate the rotation of main-rotor-hub assembly whilst the aerodynamic flow field was computed using the Large Eddy Simulation equations. As the CFD results were found to be in accordance with the experimental results, a reliable CFD modelling technique for the unsteady wake analysis of the helicopter main-rotor-hub assembly wake has thus been forwarded. Accordingly, this numerical modelling could be used to supplement experimental work. In addition, this research programme had also successfully proposed a modelling technique of simplified helicopter main-rotor-hub assembly viable for unsteady aerodynamic wake studies...|$|R
