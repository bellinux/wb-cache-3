5|$|In recent years, {{the high}} level of bog being {{destroyed}} by cutting has raised environmental concerns. The problem is particularly acute for raised bogs as they yield a higher-grade fuel than blanket bogs. Plans are now in place in both the Republic and Northern Ireland to conserve <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> raised bogs on the island.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Greyhound Lines {{acquired}} two more {{members of the}} National Trailways Bus System. The company purchased Carolina Trailways in 1997, followed by the intercity operations of Southeastern Trailways in 1998. Following the acquisitions, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> members of the Trailways System began interlining cooperatively with Greyhound, discontinued their scheduled route services, diversified into charters and tours, or {{went out of business}} altogether.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} by experiments in Severo Ochoa's laboratory that demonstrated that the poly-adenine RNA sequence (AAAAA...) coded for the polypeptide poly-lysine and that the poly-cytosine RNA sequence (CCCCC...) coded for the polypeptide poly-proline. Therefore, the codon AAA specified the amino acid lysine, and the codon CCC specified the amino acid proline. Using various copolymers <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> codons were then determined.|$|E

Around 30 rebels evaded capture and settled in Portuguese territory near the Nyasaland border.|$|E

Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas.

5|$|During the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s British Railways (Southern Region) {{completed}} its Kent Coast Electrification schemes, {{which meant that}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> services from the station were electrified, including boat trains. Some minor services were withdrawn, and the few remaining steam services, to Oxted and beyond, were replaced by diesel-electric multiple units. Various plans were proposed {{at this time to}} redevelop Victoria, including new offices, hotels and a helicopter station. The last steam service left Victoria on 8 January 1964 to , after which it was replaced by diesel-electric multiple units.|$|E

5|$|This {{island is}} {{unlikely}} to disappear entirely in the near future. The eroded area consisted mostly of loose tephra, easily washed away. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> area is capped by hard lava flows, which are much more resistant to erosion. In addition, complex chemical reactions within the loose tephra within the island have gradually formed highly erosion resistant tuff material, in {{a process known as}} palagonitization. On Surtsey this process has happened quite rapidly, due to high temperatures not far below the surface.|$|E
