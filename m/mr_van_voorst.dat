2500|$|Robert <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> {{states that}} most modern {{scholars}} {{believe that the}} Testimonium is partially authentic, and has a reference to Jesus. However, he states that scholars are divided on {{the tone of the}} original reference and while some scholars believe that it had a negative tone which was softened by Christian interpolators, others believe that it had a neutral tone, in keeping with the style and approach of Josephus regarding the issue. According to <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst,</b> scholars who support the negative reconstruction contend that the reference read something like [...] "source of further trouble in Jesus a wise man" [...] and that it stated [...] "he was the so-called Christ". <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states that most scholars support a neutral reconstruction which states [...] "Around this time lived Jesus, a wise man" [...] and includes no reference to [...] "he was the Christ". <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states that if the original references to Jesus had had a negative tone, the Christian scribes would have likely deleted it entirely. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> also states that the neutral reconstruction fits better with the Arabic Testimonium discovered by Pines in the 1970s. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states that the neutral reconstruction is supported by the majority of scholars because it involves far less conjectural wording and fits better with the style of Josephus.|$|R

50|$|The {{family was}} already noble from {{earliest}} times ("Uradel"). The first documented ancestor is Fredericus van Hekeren van der Ese (in 1295), {{who was an}} adviser to Reginald II of Guelders. His grandson Frederik van Heeckeren van der Eze (1320-ca. 1386) {{was the head of}} the Heeckerens faction during the War of the Guelderian Succession. Through his marriage with Lutgardis <b>van</b> <b>Voorst,</b> whose ancestors owned both the castle Rechteren near Dalfsen as well as the castle Voorst near Zwolle, the surname <b>van</b> <b>Voorst</b> entered the family. In 1432, Frederik's grandson, Frederik van Hekeren genaamd van Rechteren († 1462), married Cunegonde van Polanen. Their son, Zeger van Hekeren genaamd <b>van</b> <b>Voorst,</b> became the ancestor of the present-day family <b>van</b> <b>Voorst</b> tot Voorst. Zeger's brother, Otto van Hekeren genaamd van Rechteren († 1478), became the ancestor of the counts of van Rechteren. During the nineteenth and twentieth century, the family produced several high-ranking officers of the Dutch army, Commissioners of the Queen, diplomats and members of the House of Representatives and Senate. Members carry the title of baron.|$|R

50|$|Originally, Rechteren Castle {{was owned}} by the counts of Bentheim. It is first {{mentioned}} in 1190. In 1315, it became the property of Herman <b>van</b> <b>Voorst.</b> Through inheritances, it became property of the van Heeckeren, that split into the <b>van</b> <b>Voorst</b> en <b>van</b> Rechteren family. The counts of Rechteren inherited the castle, and it is nowadays still the family's property. The castle is not open to visitors.|$|R
5000|$|Allen Kerkeslager {{called the}} book a [...] "marvelous achievement" [...] and commended its clear organization. He criticised <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> for using divergences from the {{canonical}} Gospels as evidence against the historical {{value of the}} New Testament apocrypha, but noted that the author usually offered additional grounds for his conclusions. Darrell L. Bock called the book [...] "an excellent up-to-date survey", [...] "careful and thorough". Helen E. Bond considered <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst's</b> treatment of the New Testament apocrypha particularly strong, while Curt Niccum found his book generally useful but least good on Jewish literature. G. Van Belle criticised <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst's</b> assignment of [...] to the Signs Gospel against the verdict of two authors cited in the book.|$|R

50|$|The {{reinforcements}} {{were sent}} {{in by the}} commander of the Field Army—Baron <b>van</b> <b>Voorst</b> tot Voorst—to stabilise the front. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> also decided to take additional measures. The number of troops at his disposal was very limited because most reserve forces were involved in repelling an airborne attack near The Hague. He could deploy seven battalions: II-11 RI, I-20 RI and five battalions of the newly arrived Brigade B. The safest option was to give up the Stopline and to regroup at a new defensive line, but the Dutch Army lacked the Engineer capacity to quickly create one and thus <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> ordered the forces in the Stopline to recapture the Frontline. A captain from the General Staff sent to the 4th Division—A.H.J.L. Fiévez—drew up an attack plan on the night of 12 May.|$|R
