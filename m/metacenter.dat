50|$|Metacentre is {{determined}} by the ratio between the inertia resistance of the boat and the volume of the boat. (The inertia resistance is a quantified description of how the waterline width of the boat resists overturning.) Wide and shallow or narrow and deep hulls have high transverse <b>metacenters</b> (relative to the keel), and the opposite have low metacenters; the extreme opposite is shaped like a log or round bottomed boat.|$|R
40|$|For some time, the {{designers}} of airplanes {{have begun to}} occupy themselves {{with the question of}} longitudinal stability.

In this study a diagram was constructed from the data of the tunnel tests, which depends neither on the position of the center of gravity nor of the angle of deflection of the elevators. This diagram is constructed by means of straight lines drawn through the <b>metacenters</b> of the complete airplane, in a direction parallel to the tangents to the polar of the airplane relative to a system of axes fixed with reference to the airplane...|$|R
50|$|When {{a vessel}} has {{negative}} metacentric height (GM) i.e., is in unstable equilibrium, any external force {{applied to the}} vessel will cause it to start heeling. As it heels, the moment of inertia of the vessel's waterplane (a plane intersecting the hull at the water's surface) increases, which increases the vessel's BM (distance {{from the center of}} Buoyancy to the <b>Metacenter).</b> Since there is relatively little change in KB (distance from the Keel to the center of Buoyancy) of the vessel, the KM (distance from Keel to the <b>Metacenter)</b> of the vessel increases.|$|E
50|$|Ship {{stability}} {{is an area}} of naval architecture and ship design that deals with how a ship behaves at sea, both in still water and in waves, whether intact or damaged. Stability calculations focus on the center of gravity, center of buoyancy, and <b>metacenter</b> of vessels and on how these interact.|$|E
50|$|Other {{cultures}} stabilized their watercraft {{by filling}} {{the bottom with}} rocks and other ballast. The practice {{can be traced back}} to the Romans, Phoenicians, Vikings and others. Modern ocean liners carry tons of ballast. Naval architects enssure that the center of gravity of their designs remains substantially below the <b>metacenter.</b> The low centre of gravity acts as a counterweight as the craft rotates around its centre of buoyancy, creating a restorative force as the craft deviates from its vertical position.|$|E
5000|$|Ship stability, as it {{pertains}} to naval architecture, has been taken into account for hundreds of years. Historically, ship stability calculations for ships relied on rule of thumb calculations, often tied to a specific system of measurement. Some of these very old equations continue to be used in naval architecture books today. However, the advent of calculus-based methods of determining stability, particularly Pierre Bouguer's introduction of the concept of the <b>metacenter</b> in the 1740'S ship model basin allows much more complex analysis.|$|E
50|$|Intact {{stability}} calculations {{are relatively}} straightforward and involve {{taking all the}} centers of mass of objects on the vessel which are then computed/calculated to identify {{the center of gravity}} of the vessel, and the center of buoyancy of the hull. Cargo arrangements and loadings, crane operations, and the design sea states are usually taken into account. The photo at right illustrates a common misconception about vessels. In fact, {{in the vast majority of}} vessels, the center of gravity is well above the center of buoyancy. The ship is stable because as it begins to heel, one side of the hull begins to rise from the water and the other side begins to submerge. This causes the center of buoyancy to shift toward the side that is lower in the water. The job of the naval architect is to make sure that the center of buoyancy shifts outboard of the center of gravity as the ship heels. A line drawn from the center of buoyancy in a slightly heeled condition vertically will intersect the centerline at a point called the <b>metacenter.</b> As long as the <b>metacenter</b> is further above the keel than the center of gravity, the ship is stable in an upright condition.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{stability}} of a ship {{is largely due to}} freeboard at high rolling angles, she was given a larger metacentric height (the vertical distance between the <b>metacenter</b> and the centre of gravity below it) of around 4.1 ft instead of the 3.6 ft {{of the rest of the}} Royal Sovereigns to make her roll less in rough seas. This had the effect of making her roll period shorter by around 7% compared to her sisters, which in turn made her gunnery less accurate. Bilge keels were fitted in 1894 which improved her maneouverability.|$|E
50|$|In 1735 Bouguer sailed with Charles Marie de La Condamine on a {{scientific}} mission to Peru, to measure {{a degree of}} the meridian arc near the equator. Ten years were spent in this operation, a full account of which was published by Bouguer in 1749, La figure de la terre. In 1746 he published the first treatise of naval architecture, Traité du navire, which among other achievements first explained {{the use of the}} <b>metacenter</b> as a measure of ships' stability. His later writings were nearly all upon the theory of navigation and naval architecture.|$|E
5000|$|The water {{draft of}} a large ship has little direct link with its {{stability}} because stability depends solely on the respective positions of the <b>metacenter</b> of the hull {{and the center of}} gravity. It is also true however, that a [...] "light" [...] ship has quite high stability which can lead to implying too much rolling of the ship (due to memory). A fully laden ship (with a large draft) can have either a strong or weak stability, depending upon the manner by which the ship is loaded (height of the center of gravity).|$|E
50|$|The spreader-bar hammock {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by wooden or metal bars {{at the head}} and foot of the hammock, spreading its width and allowing for easy access for casual use, such as in a backyard. Unfortunately, the spreader bars also make the hammock unsteady since the <b>metacenter</b> of the hammock when sleeping is very high. This style is generally considered less stable and less comfortable for sleeping than other styles. A subset of this style is the single-spreader bar hammock, which uses a spreader bar on only one end and is much more stable. A variation of the single-spreader bar hammock has three attachment points, one at each corner of the spreader bar and one at the non-spreader bar end and is nearly untippable.|$|E
50|$|Instability {{is caused}} by the centre of mass of the ship rising above the <b>metacenter</b> {{resulting}} in the ship tipping on its side or capsizing, which {{is often referred to as}} foundered or foundering. This can lead to a sinking if the openings on the upper side are not watertight at the time of the capsize. To remain buoyant, the hull of a vessel must prevent water entering the large air spaces of the vessel (known as downflooding). Clearly for the ship to float, the submerged parts of the hull will be watertight, but the upper parts of the hull must have openings to allow ventilation to compartments, including the engine room, for crew access, and to load and unload cargo. Large ships are designed with Compartments to help avoid foundering.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{issue with}} Hood {{was that the}} {{stability}} of a ship {{is largely due to}} freeboard at high rolling angles, so she had to be given a larger metacentric height (the vertical distance between the <b>metacenter</b> and the centre of gravity below it) of around 4.1 ft instead of the 3.6 ft {{of the rest of the}} Royal Sovereigns to make her roll less in rough seas. This had the effect of making her roll period shorter by around 7% compared to her sisters, which in turn made her gunnery less accurate. White had purposely selected a high GM to minimise rolling and he did not think that bilge keels were needed. When [...] experienced heavy rolling during a heavy storm in December 1893, which earned the class the nickname Rolling Ressies, her sister ship, , was fitted with bilge keels while still fitting out and conclusively demonstrated their effectiveness during comparative trials. The rest of the ships were fitted with bilge keels in 1894-95.|$|E

40|$|The {{safety of}} vessels {{has been of}} concern to mariners for centuries. Concepts of vessel stability, the {{possibility}} of capsizing, and structural integrity have been recognized by shipbuilders and operators {{from the beginning of}} marine shipping industry. The concepts of <b>metacenter</b> and restoring arm as initial stability criteria for small heel angles and practical methodologies for their evaluation were introduced in 18 th century. The oldest traceable ship safety recommendations were found in the Venetian code of maritime law (13 th century) requesting marking and inspection of the load line mark. After the Titanic tragedy the first International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) took place in 1913 - 1914, but its recommendations on subdivision and damage stability were not adopted until the next SOLAS meeting in 1929. The 1992 report on the ?Herald of Free Enterprise? accident identified and recommended the need for replacement of prescriptive rules with performance based regulations. The UK Marine Safety Agency, in 1993, suggested to the IMO?s Marine Safety Committee (MSC) the concept of formal safety assessment with respect to ship design and operations. The proposition was accepted and FSA became a high priority on the MSC agenda. The Formal Safety Assessment process has been defined by the IMO as: Structured and systematic methodology, aimed at enhancing maritime safety, including protection of life, health, the marine environment and property by using risk analysis and cost benefit assessment. The method is applicable to consider the safety of vessels in a global sense (all systems) or to take into account subsystems or individual aspects of safe operations. It could be applied in situations where risk needs to be reduced but required decisions are not clearly defined and need to be analysed. It can be applied during ship design stages or to analyse single operational aspects of existing vessels. The process can be used to validate existing and/or new regulations developed applying prescriptive or risk based principles. This paper discusses aspects of FSA procedures and its implementation into deployment and validation of new regulations for vessels. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|We present {{preliminary}} results from simulations done on 170 32 3 × 64 lattices at β = 6. 0 using quenched Wilson fermions. This talk {{focuses on the}} Q 2 behavior of the form-factors, extrapolation in quark masses, dependence on renormalization scheme, and comparison with heavy-quark effective theory (HQET). Even though we cannot estimate errors due to quenching and discretization, our {{results are consistent with}} experimental results for D decays. We present results for the Isgur-Wise function and estimate ξ ′ (w = 1) = 0. 97 (6). 1. TECHNICAL DETAILS We briefly mention some details of our analysis to extract the form-factors at Q 2 = 0 relevant to phenomenology. A full analysis will be presented elsewhere [1]. The details of the lattices are contained in the papers on the hadron spectrum [2] [3], and decay constants [4]. Preliminary results on a sub-set of lattices have been presented at LATTICE 94 [5] and DPF 94 [6]. We do not have data to extrapolate to mb or to a = 0, thus our results are relevant for D decays, i. e. D → Klν, D → πlν, D → K ∗ lν, and D → ρlν, calculated at a − 1 = 2. 33 (4) GeV. The decaying D meson is created at rest by using a ⃗p = 0 source. On each lattice we make two measurements by creating the D meson at t = 7 and 57, for a total statistical sample size of 340. The sink for the final state meson is at t = 32 in both cases. The time-slice of the weak operator is taken to vary between 10 ≤ t ≤ 30 and 35 ≤ t ≤ 55 respectively, and the insertion is at 5 lowest values of lattice momenta. The quark propagators are created using a Wuppertal smeared source as described in [2]. In order to isolate the desired matrix element (ME) we construct a ratio of 3 -point to 2 -point correlation functions. We have a choice of using either smeared-smeared (SS) or smeared-local (SL) 2 -point correlation functions. We calculate ∗ Based on talks presented by Tanmoy Bhattacharya and Rajan Gupta.
