40|$|Abstract. When {{providing}} hydrologic indicators {{needed for}} {{hydro power plant}} design, knowledge of <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> flows allows for estimation of majority of indicators. The paper deals with a problem of obtaining <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> flows at the location where flow observation data do not exist. The closest gauge station from the observation network is selected as an analogue location/basin. Since the selected gauge station observation period is rather short, {{the extension of the}} data set is achieved by generating synthetic <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> flow series by the nonlinear correlation method explained within the paper. Attention is paid to finding the best fit for correlation within the observation period. Four segmentation types of the correlation curve of transformed values are studied. Observed data are used for estimation of applied model quality i. e. spatial interpolation of surrounding gauge stations to the analogue station. At the selected hydro power plant location, synthetic series of <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> flow is calculated by scaling series from the analogue gauge station, using basin area ratio as scaling coefficient.

40|$|This {{research}} project introduces {{the analysis of}} the seasonality of high precipitation and high streamflows in Slovenia. A similar project was made a few years ago in Austria. The first part covers the seasonality of annual maximum daily precipitation, maximum <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> precipitation and minimal <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> precipitation. The second part contains {{the analysis of the}} seasonality of maximum annual flood peaks, maximum <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> streamflow and minimal <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> streamflow. The goal of such analysis is to obtain data, which indicates the annual timing of high precipitation, high streamflows and flood occurrence in different regions of Slovenia. The seasonality of minimal <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> precipitation and minimal monthly streamflow indicates the annual timing of meteorological and hydrological drought in Slovenia. All main meteorological and hydrological processes, that cause floods and drought in Slovenia, are presented. A data base of 370 raingauges and 305 streamgauges was formed for the analysis. The used statistical procedure is in detail described and the results are presented on maps. In {{the last part of the}} work, the regression between the used meteorological data and altitude is presented, whereas the used hydrological data is presented in regression with the size of the basin areas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the yearly temporal pattern of fire activity and its relationship to weather in Lebanon during the past decade. The specific objectives were (1) to determine the start, peak and end dates of the fire season and their temporal changes throughout the years, and (2) to evaluate corresponding weather variability and its relationship to changes in fire occurrence and seasonality. First, fire seasonality was determined using fire occurrence data from 2001 to 2011. Second, the de-trended <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> weather variables were studied for correlation with fire occurrence between the earliest starting month and the latest ending month of the determined fire seasons. The results showed that the average length of the fire season was 146. 6 days, the average start date was 14 June, and the average end date was 12 November. Fire occurrence was positively correlated with <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> temperatures and negatively correlated with <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> precipitation and <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> wind speed. The length of the fire season was negatively correlated with mean annual precipitation. In addition, an increasing fire occurrence risk was observed in association with high maximum temperatures and long dry seasons...|$|R
