5|$|A {{low-pass}} filter {{can be implemented}} quite directly from a ladder topology lumped-element prototype with the stepped impedance filter shown in figure 5. The filter consists of alternating sections of high-impedance and low-impedance lines which correspond to the series inductors and shunt capacitors in the lumped-element implementation. Low-pass filters are commonly used to feed direct current (DC) bias to active components. Filters intended for this application are {{sometimes referred to as}} chokes. In such cases, each element of the filter is λ/4 in length (where λ is the wavelength of the main-line signal to be blocked from transmission into the DC source) and the high-impedance sections of the line are made as narrow as the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technology</b> will allow in order to maximise the inductance. Additional sections may be added as required for the performance of the filter just as they would for the lumped-element counterpart. As well as the planar form shown, this structure is particularly well suited for coaxial implementations with alternating discs of metal and insulator being threaded on to the central conductor.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of globalization, {{intensity}} of competition has been increased in world markets. Success of the companies in suchcompetitive environment depend on continuous improving capabilities of meeting the expectations of customers in correct place,time, amount and quality at lower cost. Advanced <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Technologies</b> (AMT) {{are one of the}} most importantdevelopments in product and process technology improvement in intensive competition. Nowadays, it is necessary to useAdvanced <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Technologies</b> that increase the capability of producing and delivering customized products to providelower cost, higher quality products and increased productivity. Ever increasing global competition has increased the interest on application, development and transfer of advancedmanufacturing <b>technologies.</b> While advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> increase companies’ capabilities for lower cost andensure quicker deliveries of customized products, they also help developing new <b>manufacturing</b> strategies. Advancedmanufacturing <b>technologies</b> are commonly expected in manufacturing industry as one of the most important developments inbusiness world. On the other hand, use or transfer of advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> require organizational changes andapplications of connected techniques. Advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> include technologies for product and process development, planning, control andmanufacturing processes as well as the technologies to organize those activities and processes. While computer-controlledmanufacturing tools and machines are called <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies,</b> activities to collaborate manufacturing technologiessuch as Total Quality Management and Just in Time are called management technologies. Technological transformation process,which is used to achieve aims and targets of a business are the indicators of the organizational technologies. In simple terms, thetechniques which are used to transform organizational inputs to outputs are defined as management <b>technologies.</b> Advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> are provide positive values to manufacturing activities by allowing lower cost, moreproductive and affective production, and better quality. Advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> have some tangible and intangibleadvantages. Tangible advantages include decreased inventory level, less space requirement for inventories, faster return of investments, and lower unit cost. Competitive advantage, flexibility, better product quality, and quicker response to customerdemand are some intangible advantages of advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies.</b> Organizational arrangements and advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> can provide competitive advantage over massproduction. Advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> help solving a number of problems in organizations. For instance, use ofcomputer-aided design and computer-aided <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> decrease design and manufacturing times for newproducts. Nevertheless, some difficulties in AMT use and some failures have raised scepticism on the use of advanced manufacturingtechnologies. Recent studies highlight that such failures have not been directly caused by advanced manufacturing technologiesbut because of unsuccessful implementation process to the organizations. In order to take full advantage of advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies,</b> it is important to understand that AMTs are notindividually sufficient and human resources must be adopted to this process. It is also important to recognize that advancedmanufacturing technologies require vast amount of investment so that they can be economically feasible only in higherproduction levels. Therefore, in this study; type, performance, utilization level, and aim of advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> in use havebeen investigated for the industrial establishments in Manisa Organized Industrial Region. Success rate and implementationproblems have been also examined. Participants of the research are the only manufacturing companies in Manisa Organized Industrial Region, and 29 manufacturers have completed the questionnaire. The data has been prepared and analyzed in "SPSS for Windows Version 15. 0. ". The findings of the research suggest the following suggestions:Majority of the participants are deep-rooted SMEs. Half of the participants are exporters and therefore competing ininternational markets. Hence, use of advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> is almost a necessity for those companies. Most of the participants state that there is a strong competition in their industry. Understanding the competitive nature of theindustry show that participants realize that they need to take advantage of advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> in order tostrength their competitive power. Majority of the participants state that they have make-to-order or hybrid manufacturing systems. Such manufacturing systemsrequire flexibility, which is crucial in a highly competitive environment. Participants of the research find themselves in a better position than their competitors in customized manufacturing in termsof reliability and quality. Although most of the participants are SMEs and face difficulties in funding advanced manufacturingtechnologies, such findings highlight that they successfully use AMTs at middle or higher levels. Adoption of advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> has been significantly increased in participant manufacturers. This findingemphasize that in order to be successful in a competitive environment, companies take advantage of advanced manufacturingtechnologies to reduce costs and to increase product quality and productivity. The participants assert that the level of advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> use positively affect the business performance. Thus, it is expected from manufacturing companies to make full advantage of advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> in order toimprove business performance. Participants of the research affirm that they use advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> to improve competitive power, toincrease quality and to reduce costs. Increase in quality and reduce in costs improves competitive power. In fact, the mostimportant reasons to use advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies,</b> reported in the literature, are also increasing quality, reducingcosts and improving competitive power. Lack of educated and qualified personnel is the most important problems about the use of advanced manufacturingtechnologies. Most of the participants state that advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> brings competitive advantage over their competitors. In today’s global competitive environment, use of advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> is crucially important for manufacturingcompanies. Nevertheless, advanced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> can only provide competitive advantages over the competitors if; largescale internal and external structural changes in organization are made, highly qualified employees are employed, existingemployees are trained, and especially full senior management support is provide...|$|R
