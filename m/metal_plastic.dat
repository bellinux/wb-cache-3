25|$|A {{twist drill}} {{is a bit}} with two cut grooves in {{opposite}} sides of a round bar, whereby the twisted bar produces a helical flute in order to drill holes in <b>metal,</b> <b>plastic,</b> or wood. The twist drill was invented by Stephen A. Morse in October 1861 and later patented on April 7, 1863.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} twist drill bit (sold in general {{hardware}} stores) {{has a point}} angle of 118 degrees, acceptable for use in wood, <b>metal,</b> <b>plastic,</b> and most other materials, although it does not perform as well as using the optimum angle for each material. In most materials it does not tend to wander or dig in.|$|E
25|$|Recyclable {{materials}} {{include many}} kinds of glass, paper, and cardboard, <b>metal,</b> <b>plastic,</b> tires, textiles, and electronics. The composting or other reuse of biodegradable waste—such as food or garden waste—is also considered recycling. Materials to be recycled are either brought to a collection center or picked up from the curbside, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials destined for manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|Pesticides, heavy <b>metals,</b> <b>plastics,</b> {{and other}} {{industrial}} and agricultural pollutants {{that do not}} disintegrate rapidly in the environment concentrate in predators such as dolphins. Injuries or deaths due to collisions with boats, especially their propellers, are also common.|$|R

25|$|Rigid {{removable}} {{tanks are}} {{installed in a}} compartment designed to accommodate the tank. They are typically of <b>metal,</b> <b>plastic</b> or fibreglass construction, and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. The aircraft does not rely on the tank for structural integrity. These tanks are commonly found in smaller general aviation aircraft, such as the Cessna 172. Combat aircraft and helicopters generally use self-sealing fuel tanks.|$|E
25|$|Chairs can be {{made from}} wood, metal, or other strong materials, like stone or acrylic. In some cases, {{multiple}} materials are used to construct a chair; for example, the legs and frame may be made from metal and the seat and back may be made from plastic. Chairs may have hard surfaces of wood, <b>metal,</b> <b>plastic,</b> or other materials, or some or all of these hard surfaces may be covered with upholstery or padding. The design may be made of porous materials, or be drilled with holes for decoration; a low back or gaps can provide ventilation. The back may extend above the height of the occupant's head, which can optionally contain a headrest. Chairs can also be made from more creative materials, such as recycled materials like cutlery and wooden play bricks, pencils, plumbing tubes, rope, corrugated cardboard, and PVC pipe.|$|E
25|$|The new layout {{was started}} in 2001, is of a {{double-track}} looped-8 design; but has been built around the walls, with several reversing loops, curved laminate benchwork, more than 2000 linear feet of track, and a scale model of Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. Scenery has been built {{with a mix of}} hydrocal and extruded styrofoam board, and North Coast Engineering (NCE) Digital Command Control has been installed to allow running of multiple trains without the need for complex relay systems. The layout also features working signals that display proper occupancy, as well as scale-sized lighting fixtures for night scenes. Additionally, a new On30 narrow gauge branchline is being constructed {{at one end of the}} layout, with plans to expand it as time and resources allow. Rolling stock is owned by the individual members, with the club jointly owning the layout and control system. This rolling stock represents all periods of history, and is a mixture of brass, bronze, tin, white <b>metal,</b> <b>plastic,</b> resin, wood, paper, cardboard, and die-cast models; most of which has been extensively kitbashed/modified, features custom paint and water-slide decals; and has been weathered to better replicate real-world conditions.|$|E
50|$|Sims Recycling Solutions offers repair, {{refurbishment}} {{and recycling}} services for electronic and electrical goods, such as computers, laptops, televisions, monitors and mobile devices. From the recycling process Sims recovers {{materials such as}} precious <b>metals,</b> <b>metals,</b> <b>plastic</b> and glass.|$|R
50|$|Waste management. All {{organic waste}} is fed to goats {{belonging}} to the Topnaar community. Recyclable waste like glass, <b>metals,</b> <b>plastics</b> and paper are taken to Walvis Bay where they are handed to recycling agencies linked to the Walvis Bay Municipality.|$|R
50|$|Increased {{rigidity}} {{results in}} lower weight: Vault structures provide a multidimensional rigidity {{to the material}} against bending and bulging. Components made e.g. from <b>metal,</b> <b>plastics</b> or fibrous materials can be used - with the same functionality - to save material and weight.|$|R
25|$|A modern beginner's bassoon is {{generally}} made of maple, with medium-hardness types such as sycamore maple and sugar maple preferred. Less-expensive models are also made of {{materials such as}} polypropylene and ebonite, primarily for student and outdoor use; metal bassoons {{were made in the}} past but have not been produced by any major manufacturer since 1889. The bore of the bassoon is conical, like that of the oboe and the saxophone, and the two adjoining bores of the boot joint are connected {{at the bottom of the}} instrument with a U-shaped metal connector. Both bore and tone holes are precision-machined, and each instrument is finished by hand for proper tuning. The walls of the bassoon are thicker at various points along the bore; here, the tone holes are drilled at an angle to the axis of the bore, which reduces the distance between the holes on the exterior. This ensures coverage by the fingers of the average adult hand. Wooden instruments are lined with hard rubber along the interior of the wing and boot joints to prevent damage from moisture; wooden instruments are also stained and varnished. The end of the bell is usually fitted with a ring, either of <b>metal,</b> <b>plastic</b> or ivory. The joints between sections consist of a tenon fitting into a socket; the tenons are wrapped in either cork or string as a seal against air leaks. The bocal connects the reed to the rest of the instrument and is inserted into a socket at the top of the wing joint. Bocals come in many different lengths and styles, depending on the desired tuning and playing characteristics.|$|E
500|$|An underwire bra (also under wire bra, under-wire bra, or underwired bra) is a {{brassiere}} that utilizes a thin, semi-circular {{strip of}} rigid material fitted inside the brassiere fabric. The wire {{may be made}} of <b>metal,</b> <b>plastic,</b> or resin. It is sewn into the bra fabric and under each cup, from the center gore to under the wearer's armpit. The wire helps to lift, separate, shape, and support a woman's breasts. Many different brassiere designs incorporate an underwire, including shelf bras, demi bras, nursing bras, and bras built into other articles of clothing, such as [...] tank tops, dresses and swimsuits.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{lightness}} of plastic versus glass or <b>metal,</b> <b>plastic</b> may reduce energy consumption. For example, packaging beverages in PET plastic rather than glass or metal {{is estimated to}} save 52% in transportation energy.|$|E
50|$|The {{reclamation}} practices used by {{the company}} harvest down to the component level and salvage all reusable materials, such as precious <b>metals,</b> <b>plastic</b> and glass. Repairs are made with refurbished parts wherever possible, and all disposals are performed in an environmentally responsible manner.|$|R

50|$|Most hard, {{non-absorbent}} materials (<b>metals,</b> <b>plastics,</b> etc.) not chemically {{attacked by}} the cleaning fluid are suitable for ultrasonic cleaning. Ideal materials for ultrasonic cleaning include small electronic parts, cables, rods, wires and detailed items, as well as objects made of glass, plastic, aluminium or ceramic.|$|R
2500|$|Earring {{components}} {{may be made}} of {{any number}} of materials, including <b>metal,</b> <b>plastic,</b> glass, precious stone, beads, wood, bone, and other materials. [...] Designs range from small loops and studs to large plates and dangling items. [...] The size is ultimately limited by the physical capacity of the earlobe to hold the earring without tearing. [...] However, heavy earrings worn over {{extended periods of time}} may lead to stretching of the earlobe and the piercing.|$|E
2500|$|When {{eating a}} meal, Inuit place large slabs of meat, blubber, {{and other parts}} of the animal on a piece of <b>metal,</b> <b>plastic,</b> or {{cardboard}} on the floor. From here, anyone in the house is able to cut off a piece of meat. At these meals, no one is obliged to join in the meal; Inuit eat only when hungry. Sometimes, though, meals are announced to the whole camp. A woman does this by the shout of [...] "Ujuk!" [...] which means [...] "cooked meat".|$|E
