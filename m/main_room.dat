5|$|To {{record the}} album, Jackson {{suggested}} a small studio located outside of Washington, D.C. in Silver Spring, Maryland. The sessions {{took place in}} September and October 1973 at Silver Spring's D Sound Studios. According to Scott-Heron, the studio's <b>main</b> <b>room</b> was so small that when the two musicians recorded, Jackson was forced out next to the cooler, playing flute in the studio's hallway while Scott-Heron sang in the <b>main</b> <b>room.</b> However, Scott-Heron felt comfortable in the small studio. Jose Williams was enlisted as the recording engineer for the album. Williams assisted Scott-Heron and Jackson, who were credited for production under the title Perpis-Fall Music, Inc., with production, and he engineered the album's recordings entirely himself.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long <b>main</b> <b>room</b> with two storage and sleeping quarters towards {{the back of the}} house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located {{toward the back of the}} <b>main</b> <b>room,</b> were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
5|$|Hawley's {{first period}} (945–1030) was {{suggested}} by tree ring dates scattered throughout later parts of Chetro Ketl. Archeologists subsequently discovered that her second period (1030–90) structure was built directly over an earlier (990–1030) one-story-tall, two-room-wide row of rooms. Lekson shortened Hawley's second period to 1030–75, and subdivided it into {{at least eight}} different construction events, including the successive additions of upper stories along the <b>main</b> <b>room</b> block, running {{the length of the}} building. After 1075, construction consisted of minor additions and alternations, {{with the exception of a}} row of three large, Chaco-style second- and third-story round rooms that were added to the plaza-facing center of the <b>main</b> <b>room</b> block during 1075–95. Much of the later construction, including the large Chaco-style kivas, was in McElmo style masonry, using shaped blocks of relatively soft tan colored sandstone instead of the previously preferred harder, denser dark brown sandstone, which may have been quarried out in the central canyon after 1075. Chetro Ketl required an estimated 50 million sandstone blocks and more than 500,000 man-hours to complete.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Brown enters another room {{surrounded}} by people in animal heads, and performs the third dance sequence in the video with his backup dancers. Towards {{the end of the}} chorus, Brown and his dancers appear back inside the <b>main</b> <b>room</b> and continue dancing. At one point, the video is slowed down as Brown and his dancers do flips. In other scenes, he is seen dancing alone with a cane in a rain-filled room, wearing white dress pants, a black tank top and a fedora. Brown then splits into three people, comes back together, takes off his shirt and throws it at the camera, causing its lens to crack.|$|E
5|$|After {{releasing}} 12-inch singles on Big Apple, they founded DMZ Records, {{which has}} released fourteen 12"s to date. They also began their night DMZ, held {{every two months}} in Brixton, a part of London already strongly associated with reggae. DMZ has showcased new dubstep artists such as Skream, Kode9, Benga, Pinch, DJYoungsta, Hijak, Joe Nice, and Vex'd. DMZ's first anniversary event (at the Mass venue, a converted church) saw fans attending from places {{as far away as}} Sweden, the United States, and Australia, leading to a queue of 600 people at the event. This forced the club to move from its regular 400-capacity space to Mass' <b>main</b> <b>room,</b> an event cited as a pivotal moment in dubstep's history.|$|E
5|$|Inside, the <b>main</b> <b>room</b> is {{a conference}} room {{on the main floor}} that {{includes}} a large projection system {{that can be used for}} remote feeds, such as from the state capitol across the street. A painting by John Fery is displayed over the fireplace, which the fireplace was part of the original structure in the conference room. The remainder of the interior of the building has a modern look with glass-enclosed offices surrounding an open common area. Artwork owned by the university's Hallie Ford Museum of Art is displayed in this area. The main floor of the three-story building is the second floor, which rests atop the look-out basement. A small meeting room is located above a small portion of the main floor.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} comprises four rooms about {{a center}} hall {{running through the}} house. The <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> are on the south side, with smaller rooms on the north. All of the first floor rooms have wainscoting and fireplaces. The chimney pents serve as closets for the <b>main</b> <b>rooms.</b> The center hall is divided by an arch, with a stair to the rear.|$|R
50|$|No.12 is {{a smaller}} {{building}} {{consisting of two}} <b>main</b> <b>rooms,</b> attic bedroom, and hallway with a pressed metal ceiling {{which leads to the}} rear of the house, where twentieth century kitchen, dining room and bathroom facilities have been added. In 1988 false ceilings were installed in the <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> to accommodate track lighting, and the house was converted into an art gallery, the attic room becoming an artist's studio.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{has four}} <b>main</b> <b>rooms,</b> two with a fireplace. The two <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> have pressed metal ceilings and some original four-panelled doors survive. The attic contains two rooms which {{are lined with}} tongue and groove boarding and which have internal shutters on the windows. A ledged and braced door is between the two rooms. The attic is accessed by a steep central staircase with simple square balusters.|$|R
5|$|The Northern Quarter of Delos {{contains}} the Jewelry Quarter, where older {{structures such as}} workshops and other archaeological remains dating to the 3rd century BC and early 2nd century BC have been discovered. By {{the second half of}} the 2nd century BC these were replaced by private homes built in the most characteristic fashion for Delos: a narrow, rectangular floor plan with a central courtyard, a vestibule service room in the front, and a larger, <b>main</b> <b>room</b> in the rear. The quarter of the House of the Masks is the only area of Delos without this archetypal house plan. Some houses of the Northern Quarter feature mosaic decorations with mythological scenes, including Lycurgus of Thrace and Ambrosia in an upper-story mosaic, as well as Athena and Hermes together with a seated woman in a main-room mosaic.|$|E
5|$|The {{prisoner}} reformer John Howard {{reported in}} 1777 that the gaol was very small, forming a <b>main</b> <b>room</b> with three separate cages running along one side; {{one of these}} cages was reserved for female prisoners. The upper room {{was used as a}} chapel, and food for the inmates was lowered through a hole by the prison gaoler. In 1779, after complaints were made by about the conditions, £500 was granted by Parliament and the gaol was enlarged to comprise a day room and a total of seven cells for male and female prisoners, with accommodation for the prison governor on the first floor. In exchange, the county agreed to take over the maintenance of the gaol. By 1795, Hugh Percy, the 2nd Duke of Northumberland, had become an important local landowner in the region and acquired the rights to the post of constable from the Duke of Cornwall, the then Prince George.|$|E
5|$|As other {{scenes of}} Carey in the latex mini {{and by the}} large red hone prop are interspersed, the club scene alters to a poker table, where Ealy reveals three of his card, '556', {{completing}} four of the seven digits of Carey phone number. The next scene finds Carey sitting on a large pink sofa in an empty room in the club, sporting only a white man's suit jacket and stilettos. As the song reaches the bridge, Carey is shown back in the club's <b>main</b> <b>room</b> dancing, as she leaves a number '4' on a nearby table for the man to find. As Carey once again {{is shown in the}} yellow latex dress, she walks down a small aisle, placing another card with the number '4' into Ealy's jacket pocket, before storming through the club by several followers. As the video ends, the number '555-6464' are shown lying on a small table, while Carey sits on the large pink sofa, and Ealy is seen on the other side gazing at her. The video concludes with Ealy slowly approaching Carey on the large sofa, as she winks and smiles to the camera.|$|E

5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks the cab driver {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks the driver to turn up the air conditioner because he's hot, but the driver turns up the music instead, while wearing a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits the cab and arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside the <b>main</b> <b>room</b> of the club filled with flashing lights and people dancing while wearing animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by flashing lights and speakers in the background.|$|E
5|$|While on the trip, he did {{sketch a}} line of walking wounded, and some prisoners making {{their way to the}} rear from an early morning offensive. This became the basis of the {{painting}} The Harvest of Battle which was the largest single work Nevinson painted. It was completed in February 1919 and Nevinson arranged a 'private view' of the painting in his studio on 2 April for numerous critics and journalists. Whilst this produced some favourable reviews, notably in the Daily Express, it also led to articles claiming that the painting was so grim that it was being withheld from the public. When the painting was shown at the huge The Nation's War Paintings and Drawings exhibition organised by the Imperial War Museum in December 1919 at Burlington House Nevinson was furious to find it had not been hung in the <b>main</b> <b>room</b> but rather in a side gallery. He began a campaign of vilification against all those he held responsible for this insult. Unreasonable as Nevinsons' outrage was it did have consequences; it destroyed his friendship with Muirhead Bone, who had been on the organising committee for the exhibition, made the Imperial War Museum wary of dealing with him, and blinded Nevinson himself to the high esteem in which his war paintings were held.|$|E

25|$|Andrew Carnegie {{was born}} in Dunfermline, Scotland in 1835, in a typical weaver's cottage with only one <b>main</b> <b>room,</b> {{consisting}} of half the ground floor which was shared with the neighboring weaver's family. The <b>main</b> <b>room</b> served as a living room, dining room and bedroom. He was named after his legal grandfather. In 1836, {{the family moved to}} a larger house in Edgar Street (opposite Reid's Park), following the demand for more heavy damask from which his father, William Carnegie, benefited. He was educated at the Free School in Dunfermline, which had been a gift to the town by the philanthropist Adam Rolland of Gask.|$|E
25|$|The {{room where}} the frieze is {{displayed}} was specially constructed {{to be the same}} size as the <b>main</b> <b>room</b> in the Temple of Apollo.

25|$|The {{name of the}} {{settlement}} of Hofstaðir, near Mývatn, and local tradition indicate it {{was the site of}} a hof. The site was excavated by Daniel Bruun in 1908 and again by Olaf Olsen in 1965. Since 1991, the Icelandic Archeological Institute (Fornleifastofnun Íslands - FSI) has re-investigated it; since 2002, in an international investigation under the Landscape of Settlements program. The excavations have uncovered a large longhouse with a small separate room at the north end, 42 meters long overall and 8 meters wide in the main section. It had three small protruding sections, two near the south end and one on the opposite side. There was a fireplace in the center and smaller fireplaces {{at both ends of the}} <b>main</b> <b>room.</b> Animal bones were found all around the inside of the walls in the <b>main</b> <b>room,</b> and a smaller number in the small room. Various associated buildings have also been excavated.|$|E
