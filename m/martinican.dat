5|$|Martinique and Guadeloupe {{are also}} home to their own {{distinct}} folk traditions, most influentially including Guadeloupan gwo ka and <b>Martinican</b> tambour and tibwa. Gwo ka {{is a type of}} percussion music which consists of seven basic rhythms and variations on them. It has been modernized into gwo ka moderne, though traditional rural performances (lewoz) are still common. Tambour and ti bwa ensembles are the origin of several important <b>Martinican</b> popular styles, including chouval bwa and biguine, and also exerted an influence on zouk. Lucian folk music features ensembles of fiddle, cuatro, banjo, guitar and chak-chak (a rattle), with the banjo and cuatro being of iconic importance, and recreational, often lyric song forms called jwé. The French Creole folk music of Dominica is based on the quadrille, accompanied by ensembles called jing ping. Folk storytelling (kont) and songs (bélé) are also {{a major part of the}} country's musical identity.|$|E
5|$|The first {{internationally known}} bands from Dominica were 1970s {{groups such as}} Exile One and Grammacks. These bands were {{the stars of the}} cadence-lypso scene, which was the first style of Dominican music to become popular across the Caribbean. By the 1980s, however, <b>Martinican</b> zouk and other styles were more popular. In 1988, WCK formed, playing an {{experimental}} fusion of cadence-lypso with the island’s jing ping sound. The result became known as bouyon, and has re-established Dominica in the field of popular music.|$|E
25|$|In 1934–36, Dunham {{performed}} {{as a guest}} artist with the ballet company of the Chicago Opera. Ruth Page had written a scenario and choreographed La Guiablesse ("The Devil Woman"), based on a <b>Martinican</b> folk tale in Lafcadio Hearn's Two Years in the French West Indies. It opened in Chicago in 1933, with a black cast and with Page dancing the title role. The next year it was repeated with Katherine Dunham in the lead and with students from Dunham's Negro Dance Group in the ensemble. Her dance career was then interrupted by her anthropological research in the Caribbean.|$|E
50|$|Halfway through Lent, <b>Martinicans</b> take a {{break from}} {{abstinence}} with the one-day holiday Micarême. The one-day mini-Carnival features dances, parties, and similar activities. Afterward, people return to their repentance until Easter begins.|$|R
50|$|As an {{overseas}} départment of France, Martinique's culture is French and Caribbean. Its former capital, Saint-Pierre (destroyed by a volcanic eruption), was {{often referred to}} as the Paris of the Lesser Antilles. Following French custom, many businesses close at midday, then reopen later in the afternoon. The official language is French, although many <b>Martinicans</b> speak a Creole patois. Based in French, Martinique's Creole also incorporates elements of English, Spanish, Portuguese, and African languages. Originally passed down through oral storytelling traditions, it continues to be used more often in speech than in writing.|$|R
5000|$|John Ladhams offers what is {{probably}} the best description of the migration and formation of the current-day Karipúna population. Members of the Arawak, Tupí, and Carib linguistic trunks were in contact with European explorers since the 16th century, and around 1830 to the 1840s, due to the Cabanagem Revolt, a group of Amerindians from the Pará region moved to modern-day Amapá (which was, at the time, claimed by French Guinea) and joined with the present ethnic groups, thus coming into contact with French or Guyanais speakers. Moving between French Guiana and Brazil in hotly contested territory from the Ounary river, to the Oyapock river, and finally towards the Curipi river where the Karipúna now live, these groups were joined by [...] "members of the Palikúr and Galibí tribes, as well as Guianan Creoles, Arabs, Chinese, Europeans, and Brazilians" [...] and eventually settled in the Uaçá area. [...] "These were ‘displaced Brazilians … called Karipúnas’." [...] Furthermore in 1854, due to a gold rush in Approuague, many [...] "coolies, Blacks, Chinese, <b>Martinicans</b> and French adventurers" [...] moved to the Oyapock and Uaçá rivers, where the Karipúna inhabited, further contributing to the broad ethnic mix.|$|R
25|$|The {{school has}} a long-standing {{reputation}} as a training ground {{for men and women}} of letters, and its alumni include novelist and dramatist Jean Giraudoux, many of whose plays among which The Trojan War Will Not Take Place and Amphitryon 38 have become staple elements of the French theatrical repertory and novelist Julien Gracq, particularly renowned for his 1951 novel The Opposing Shore. Jules Romains, the founder of Unanimism, essayists Paul Nizan and Robert Brasillach, novelist Romain Rolland and poet Charles Péguy are a few other examples of major authors who were educated there. The founder of the influential Négritude movement, <b>Martinican</b> poet Aimé Césaire, prepared and passed the entrance exam from the Lycée Louis-le-Grand where he was friends with future President of Senegal and fellow Négritude author Léopold Sédar Senghor, who failed the entrance exam. Around this same period Algerian novelist, essayist and filmmaker Assia Djebar, who would {{become one of the most}} prominent voices of Arab feminism, was a student at the school. Later, Belgian author Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt, author of the 2002 novel Oscar and the Lady in Pink, also did his studies there, as well as literary critics and theorists Paul Bénichou, Jean-Pierre Richard and Gérard Genette. Poet Paul Celan and Nobel Prize in Literature winner Samuel Beckett were both teachers at the school.|$|E

500|$|Calypso is {{most closely}} {{associated}} with the island of Trinidad, but it has spread throughout the Lesser Antilles, and abroad. Similar traditions can be found natively on many of Caribbean islands. Within the Antilles, most of the popular calypso stars have come from Trinidad and Tobago; the majority of the exceptions, such as Arrow from Montserrat, have come from other Anglophone islands. Music author Peter Manuel has argued that, despite the modern Anglophone focus to calypso-like song forms, their origins lie in the [...] "Afro-French creole culture", and notes that the ancestor of the word calypso, cariso, was first used to refer to a <b>Martinican</b> singer.|$|E
2500|$|Although the French Revolution had a {{dramatic}} impact in numerous areas of Europe, the French colonies felt a particular influence. As the <b>Martinican</b> author Aimé Césaire put it, [...] "there was in each French colony a specific revolution, that {{occurred on the}} occasion of the French Revolution, in tune with it." [...] The Haitian Revolution (Saint Domingue) became a central example of slave uprisings in French colonies.|$|E
2500|$|Lacépède {{originally}} {{applied the}} name [...] "lanceheads" [...] {{to all of}} these snakes, which he considered conspecific. Thus, older writings, as well as popular and sometimes scientific writings (including the American Heritage, Merriam-Webster, and New Shorter Oxford dictionaries), still often call them fer-de-lance (French, [...] "iron of the lance"). However, many scientists and hobbyists now restrict this name to the <b>Martinican</b> species, B. lanceolatus. Other common names include American lanceheads and American lance-headed vipers.|$|E
