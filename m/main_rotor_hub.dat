40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} by Hughes Helicopters, Inc. (HHI) for the Applied Technology Laboratory and Aeromechanics Laboratory, U. S. Army Research and Technology Laboratories (AVRADCOM) and the Ames Research Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Results of predesign studies of advanced <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs,</b> including bearingless designs, are presented in this report. In addition, the Government's rotor design goals and specifications were reviewed and evaluated. Hub concepts were designed and qualitatively evaluated in order to select the two most promising concepts for further development. Various flexure designs, control systems, and pitchcase designs were investigated during the initial phases of this study. The two designs selected for additional development were designated the V-strap and flat-strap cruciform hubs. These hubs were designed for a four bladed rotor and were sized for 18, 400 pounds gross weight with the same diameter (62 feet) and solidity (23 inch chord) as the existing rotor on the Rotor Systems Research Aircraft (RSRA) ...|$|R

50|$|A twin-engined {{version of}} the Dauphin, {{designated}} as the Dauphin 2, was announced in early 1973. The first prototype's first flight took place on 24 January 1975; production model deliveries began in December 1978. In comparison with the earlier model, the SA 365 C featured twin 470 kW (630 shp) Arriel 1 turboshafts in a new engine fairing, a Starflex <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> and a higher maximum take-off weight (3400 kg or 7,495 lb). Its Fenestron anti-torque device featured 13 metal blades. Production of both the SA 360 and SA 365 C ceased in 1981, by which time approximately 40 SA 360s and 50 SA 365 C/C1s had been built; both were replaced by the SA 365 N.|$|E
50|$|The {{helicopter}} rotor {{is powered}} by the engine, through the transmission, to the rotating mast. The mast is a cylindrical metal shaft that extends upward from—and is driven by—the transmission. At {{the top of the}} mast is the attachment point for the rotor blades called the hub. The rotor blades are then attached to the hub, and the hub can have 10-20 times the drag of the blade. Main rotor systems are classified according to how the main rotor blades are attached and move relative to the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>hub.</b> There are three basic classifications: hingeless, teetering, and fully articulated, although some modern rotor systems use a combination of these classifications. A rotor is a finely tuned rotating mass, and different subtle adjustments reduce vibrations at different airspeeds. The rotors are designed to operate at a fixed RPM (within a narrow range of a few percent), but a few experimental aircraft used variable speed rotors.|$|E
40|$|A ground {{vibration}} test {{was performed on}} the AH- 64 (Apache) helicopter to determine the frequency response of the airframe. The structure was excited at both the <b>main</b> and tail <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs,</b> separately, and response measurements were taken at 102 locations throughout the fuselage structure. Frequency responses were compared and correlated with results from a NASTRAN finite element model of AH- 64. In addition, natural frequencies and mode shapes were estimated from the frequency response data and were correlated with analytical results...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the {{assessment}} of the capability of controllers based on the combined actuation of flaps and variable-stiffness devices to alleviate helicopter <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> vibratory <b>hub</b> loads. Trailing-edge flaps are positioned at the rotor blade tip region, whereas variable-stiffness devices are located at the pitch link and at the blade root. Control laws are derived by an optimal control procedure based on the best trade-off between control effectiveness and control effort, under the constraint of satisfaction of the equations governing rotor blade aeroelastic response. The numerical investigation concerns the analysis of performance and robustness of the control techniques developed, through application to a four-bladed helicopter rotor in level flight. The identification of the most efficient control configuration is also attempted...|$|R
5000|$|The S-97 design {{includes}} {{variable speed}} rigid coaxial <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> and a variable-pitch pusher propeller, making the S-97 a compound helicopter. Like the X2, it has fly-by-wire control and dynamic anti-vibration actuators {{to cancel out}} shaking. The <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> have hingeless <b>hubs</b> and stiff blades, to improve low-speed handling and efficiency of hover. At high speeds, the close spacing of the hubs reduces drag. The stiff blades allow each rotor to have low lift on the retreating side of its rotor disk (reducing drag), whereas each rotor on a conventional coaxial rotor with [...] "floppy" [...] blades needs nearly equal lift distribution. The propeller relieves the rotor of propulsion, further reducing drag.|$|R

A retractable nosewheel undercarriage is fitted, which gives the S-76A a 6 kn increase in cruising speed; emergency flotation gear can be fitted using helium-filled bags to increase buoyancy {{in the event of a}} forced landing on water. The fuselage of the aircraft is of mixed metal and composites construction; the nose is composed of fiberglass while the cabin primarily employs a light alloy honeycomb structure, the semi-monocoque tailboom is also constructed of light alloy. [...] Two pilots (or a pilot and a passenger) sit side by side in the cockpit, situated ahead of the cabin, which can accommodate a further 12 passengers in three rows of four, or four to eight passengers in more luxurious executive seating.|$|E
40|$|The paper reports {{investigation}} of the aerodynamic performance of different hub fairing shapes and compares them to the baseline hub. The investigation relies on stationary RANS simulation of air flow past the GRC common platform fuselage and a generic <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> in cruise flight at Mach number equal to 0. 204, and - 2. 5 o pitch angle. Modular grids were generated around two fuselage configurations and three <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> shapes. Four different combinations of fuselage and rotor hub grids were generated using Chimera overlapping grid technique. The DLR unstructured RANS solver TAU was applied to predict the aerodynamic loads acting on the different computational configurations.

50|$|The 480 {{fuselage}} {{consists of}} a welded steel-tube framework with aluminum cover and tailcone. The pilot controls the aircraft from the left seat, which is unusual for helicopters.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the method of calculation of the moments about the hinge axis of the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> from the action of aerodynamic and inertial forces generated on the blade. The assumptions were taken that the blades are absolutely rigid and have a rectangular shape in plan view. Flapping motion of blade is described accurately {{up to the first}} harmonic of the Fourier series, inductive speed is considered to be uniformly distributed over the rotor disk. The aerodynamic component of hinge moment is numerical integration of running forces on blade radius taking into account aerodynamic characteristics of the profiles received according to wind tunnel tests at different angles of attack and Mach numbers. The moment from elastic forces is determined for the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> with the lamellar torsion bar. On the basis of the hinge moments values data loads on rotorcraft rotating ring, arising at different azimuthal location of the rotating main rotor blades are calculated. The calculations executed on the example of Mi- 34 helicopter main rotor have shown that average loads in one revolution in the channel of collective pitch control increase in a control path at flying speed. At the same time loads in the channel of longitudinal control make up to 80 % of loads in the channel of collective pitch control, and in the channel oflateral control - to 40 % that will well be coordinated with the provided data of flight tests...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made of {{helicopter}} tail rotor noise, particularly that due to interactions with the wakes of the <b>main</b> <b>rotor,</b> <b>hub,</b> and fuselage, and with the engine exhaust. Both harmonic and broadband noise were analyzed. The disturbed flow into the tail rotor was modeled using combinations of aerodynamic and acoustic flow codes along with some necessary estimates of turbulence properties. Representative calculations show that the main rotor wake is the strongest contributor to both harmonic and broadband tail rotor noise. The fuselage separation wake and the engine exhaust flow are also very important to both harmonic and broadband noise. The hub and hub-shaft wakes are important contributors to the broadband noise only. The tip vortices {{do not seem to}} be important to broadband noise, but their effects on harmonic noise were not modeled accurately enough to draw any conclusions from this study...|$|E

The failure started in proximity of a high stressed area and it propagated quickly in the whole titanium section but without involve the surrounding filament winding graphite, that is a fail safe device.

40|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of {{the helicopter}} rotor {{is one of the}} most elating and exigent tribulations faced by the aerodynamicists today. Study through flow visualization process plays a key role in understanding the airflow distinctiveness and vortex interaction {{of the helicopter}} main rotor blade. Inspecting and scrutinizing the effects of wake vortices during operation is a great challenge and imperative in designing effective rotor system. This study aimed to visualize the main rotor airflow pattern of the Hirobo-FALCON 505 controllable subscale helicopter and seek for the vortex flow at the blade tip. The experimental qualitative data is correlated with quantitative data to perform scrupulous study on the airflow behavior and characteristics along with its distinctiveness spawned by the main rotor blade. Simulation using design software is performed in analogous stipulations to endow with comparability between the flow visualization results. Throughout the blade span several dissimilar flow patterns have been identified.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) is expanding its helicopter research capabilities {{in order to}} facilitate present and future research demands. The rapidly changing needs have already out paced available assets. Therefore it was necessary to design and develop a new remotely piloted helicopter (RPH) that would meet present needs, NOTAR and HHC, and be flexible enough to meet future needs. The research efforts encompassed by this thesis are defining the present needs, investigating what type/size of RPH would fulfill these needs, procuring this asset, and analyzing its capabilities. Based on a defined payload, helicopter trends are analyzed to determine an estimate of the overall RPH size (gross weight) and engine size required. A preliminary design process validates these figures. Choosing to procure an RPH instead of building one, a detailed performance analysis is conducted on the main rotor system. This analysis includes blade vibration analysis, retreating blade stall analysis, and power required analysis. Modification of the RPH's <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>hub,</b> drive train, and landing gear are studied and recommendations presented. This research effort is a continuation of a long- term program to provide NPS with robust assets to support present and future rotorcraft research efforts. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E

Previous research has identified the integrated hub and pylon fairing approach as the most efficient in reducing helicopter drag.

The geometry of the new fairings is described in detail. Test results are presented in the form of plots of the six model forces and moments. The data show that model drag can be reduced by as much as 20 percent by combining a small hub fairing (that has a circular arc upper surface and a flat lower surface) integrated with a nontapered pylon fairing. To minimize drag, the gap between the lower surface of the hub and upper surface of the pylon fairing must be kept to a minimum.
