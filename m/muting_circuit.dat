5000|$|In a color TV waveform, a {{reference}} pulse, called the burst, is transmitted {{along the back}} porch portion of the video signal. If the transmitted signal is monochromatic, then the burst is not transmitted. The color killer is actually a <b>muting</b> <b>circuit</b> in the chroma section which supervises the burst and turns off the color amplifiers if no burst is received (i.e. when the received signal is monochromatic.) ...|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s {{it has been}} {{recommended}} by several authorities including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present. This avoids questionable measurements based {{on the use of}} blank media, or <b>muting</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s various {{writers such as}} Julian Dunn have {{suggested}} that dynamic range be measured {{in the presence of}} a low-level test signal. Thus, any spurious signals caused by the test signal or distortion will not degrade the signal-to-noise ratio. This also addresses concerns about <b>muting</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, {{it has been}} {{recommended}} by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society, that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out to get the noise floor. This avoids questionable measurements based {{on the use of}} blank media, or <b>muting</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This {{specification}} {{is sometimes}} referred to as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) {{in the presence of a}} signal. The label SNR should not be used due to industry confusion over the exact definition. SNR is often used to indicate signal-to-noise ratio, with the noise level being measured with no signal. This can often give an optimistic result because of <b>muting</b> <b>circuits,</b> which <b>mute</b> the noise when no signal is present.|$|R
