5|$|There was a {{post office}} in Meander by 1888, {{probably}} started the previous year. Prior to this there was an unofficial post office, a <b>mail</b> <b>depot</b> run by locals. The post office continued in a separate building until then postmaster, Harold Taylor, retired in 1977. After this post function was a service provided by the local store. There was a manual telephone exchange in the post office building. This was replaced with an automatic exchange in June 1975.|$|E

25|$|Post was {{essential}} for the morale of all troops, and so a post office {{was set up in}} Quebec barracks for the entire Bordon and Longmoor complex. This was moved from the wooden huts to a new brick building in 1908 {{on the far side of}} Camp Road, being renamed Bordon Post Office. The site today is still the location of the local Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>depot,</b> and unified army and civilian post office.|$|E

50|$|By now a {{post office}} had been built at the station, {{relocated}} in 1855 from Henri-Chapelle on instructions from the regional head post office at Aachen. At Herbesthal this quickly became one of Europe's busiest <b>mail</b> <b>depots.</b> In 1890 the postal facilities were relocated to a new purposes built post office building beside the station, which would {{be taken over by}} the Belgian postal administration in 1920. During the 1920s up to 1,000 mail bags were processed here daily, and it was only after the introduction of so-called mobile sorting offices, using dedicated rail-cars, that the postal facilities at Herbesthal station were removed.|$|R

5000|$|In November 1965, {{following}} {{the withdrawal of}} local stopping train services on the lines to West Hartlepool, Durham and [...] (due to the Beeching Axe), passenger trains were concentrated on one island platform {{with access to the}} concourse area by a dual 'one-direction' stairway. The second island platform was given over to the working of parcels traffic as a new parcels office premises was to be built at the North End and brought into use. Prior to this (certainly in 1962/3), the parcels traffic was being dealt with at the North End using the old stables block to the West for deliveries and a similar sized room at the East side for incoming parcels. Parcels traffic at the time included pigeon specials, heavy engineering parts, parcels to Europe, greyhounds to Ireland and the occasional corpse! There was also a parcels clerk at the Brian Mills <b>Mail</b> Order <b>Depot.</b>|$|R
50|$|The current {{station was}} built in 1941 by the Erie Railroad and {{replaced}} an older station {{near the site of}} the current New York State Thruway overpass.

50|$|Syon Park House (demolished in 1953, {{and not to}} be {{confused}} with Syon House itself) housed the 'Syon Park Academy' where the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley was educated between the ages of 10 and 12 before moving on to Eton. A Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>depot</b> stands on the site now. This may also be the site of the dwelling where Pocahontas lived in Brentford End between 1616 and 1617.|$|E
50|$|Shortly before W.W.I, the Post Office Department began {{assigning}} {{railway mail}} clerks to new Transfer Office positions which were established {{at many of}} the larger railroad junction points as well as passenger terminals in larger cities. These transfer clerks supervised mail exchanges between trains, served as the local liaison between the Railway Mail Service and the host railroad, and maintained detailed statistical records which were used to audit railroad charges for mail transportation and car usage. This latter task involved determining the amount of mail in baggage cars or storage mail cars, a unique process of estimating the car area occupied by mail sacks rather than counting individual sacks. Other duties included sorting letters which had been <b>mailed</b> at <b>depot</b> letter boxes and providing a hand-to-hand receipt for registered mail transferred between connecting railway post office routes. Many of the transfer offices had a unique postmark to cancel the mail which was sorted by the office, and these cancellations are still collected by philatelists and postal historians.|$|R

50|$|Brands Hill is {{a village}} in Berkshire, England. It is just on the {{outskirts}} of Colnbrook on the Bath Rd adjacent to the Langley junction of the M4 motorway. It has grown from a few houses and has never been a historical village. There are a few shops, including an M&S/BP petrol station. The former Plough Pub, which was a landmark on the bus routes from Hounslow to Slough, was demolished {{to make way for a}} hotel, The Holiday Inn, a few years ago. Many of the inhabitants work at Heathrow Airport, and the Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>Depot.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is a Correos de Chile {{post office}} staffed {{in the summer}} by a postal worker and by the command of the base in the winter. The office {{receives}} all its mail from Punta Arenas and is the <b>mail</b> <b>depot</b> and relay station for all mail addressed to any Chilean installation on Antarctica in addition to some other foreign facilities. From here it is delivered by hand, plane, or helicopter. The post office is also an attraction for tourists and philately enthusiasts that travel to the town to send postcards and letters with an Antarctic postmark.|$|E
50|$|The {{high-level}} (HL) station {{consists of}} an island platform rebuilt in 1956, with faces as platforms 4 and 5, which are roughly {{at the level of}} Old Oak Lane {{to the west of the}} station, serving the NLL and the West London Line; some trains on the latter reverse in a central turnback siding on the NLL to the east of the station, this opened in 2011. Both platforms have been extended across the DC line to accommodate 4-coach class 378 trains. The HL station previously had a third platform on the eastern side which was used by services to/from Earls Court.There is another turnback siding further east which was previously used; it was laid in the late 1990s to allow Royal Mail trains to reach the Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>depot</b> at Stonebridge Park.|$|E
50|$|The first store {{opened in}} Meander in 1892 on the East Meander Road, and was open until 1902. Different stores in Meander have sold {{a wide variety}} of goods {{over the life of the}} town; some have {{operated}} as petrol stations, butchers and grocers. At least six stores have been open at different times in the town. The only store open in the 21st century opened c.1951 and has run under various owners.There was a post office in Meander by 1888, probably started the previous year.

50|$|At {{her final}} doctor appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a {{sedative}} during an examination and induces the nurse (Vogel's wife) {{to believe that}} he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in a faux ambulance, barely ahead of the real ambulance team. Under cover of night, the trio attempt their exfiltration at Wollankstrasse Station, on a railway line along the sector boundary between East and West Berlin, and next to a <b>mail</b> <b>depot.</b> As they prepare to load Vogel onto the stopped train he suddenly awakens and sounds the horn of the stolen mail van where he is being held, alerting East German guards to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to save the compromised Rachel. The agents are left with no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction.|$|E
5000|$|When Nottingham Victoria {{railway station}} was opened in 1900, the Great Northern had to {{construct}} a new chord line, carried mainly on brick arches and steel girders, {{by means of a}} junction at Trent Lane, east of London Road, to Weekday Cross where it joined the Great Central main line. The new chord line included a station on an island platform reached, by means of a staircase from the booking office on the same approach road to the earlier London Road terminus. To avoid confusion the new station was designated 'High Level' and the old station renamed 'Low Level'. The transfer to Victoria Station gave the Great Northern a prestigious location and avoided their need to reverse trains to and from Grantham, Derbyshire, and north of Nottingham. Passenger services at the low level station were substantially reduced {{with the opening of the}} Victoria station and the last passenger service ran on 22 May 1944. The station however remained open as a <b>mail</b> <b>depot</b> for troops during the Second World War before becoming a parcels depot until the 1970s. Passengers services to the High Level station were withdrawn on 3 July 1967 when the service to Grantham was diverted to Nottingham Midland station. This left the only service using Victoria Station as that to Leicester Central and Rugby Central on the former Great Central route.|$|E
