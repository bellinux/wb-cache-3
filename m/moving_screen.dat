50|$|Following Robert's {{successful}} model, {{built in}} 1798, Saint-Léger Didot insisted that Robert {{apply for a}} patent. Prior to 1798, paper was made one sheet at a time, by dipping a rectangular frame or mould with a screen bottom into a vat of pulp. The frame {{was removed from the}} vat, and the water was pressed out of the pulp. The remaining pulp was allowed to dry; the frame could not be re-used until the previous sheet of paper was removed from it. Robert's construction had a <b>moving</b> <b>screen</b> belt that would receive a continuous flow of stock and deliver an unbroken sheet of wet paper to a pair of squeeze rolls. As the continuous strip of wet paper came off the machine it was manually hung over a series of cables or bars to dry. With Didot's urging, Robert and Didot went to François de Neufchâteau, the Minister of the Interior and applied for a patent. In 1799, the patent (brevet d'invention) was granted by the French Government, for which Robert paid 8,000 francs.|$|E

Authorities responded to the extensive damage and loss of animals by removing the dams and weirs. A proposed series of canals connecting the river with Sydney Harbour was not commenced. A sewage farm operated near the mouth of the river from 1889 to 1916.

50|$|At the time, Laterna magika also {{strove to}} address children, {{first with the}} play Lost Fairy Tale in 1975 and then, most significantly, with Wonderful Circus, premiered in 1977, which has {{remained}} in the repertoire ever since and is the most frequently performed theatre piece in Central Europe. Moreover, Wonderful Circus ushered in Laterna magika's phase as a multi-theme theatre. At the celebration marking two decades of the production's staging, Josef Svoboda said: “The whole intention was centred on a circus theme, with a panoramic <b>moving</b> <b>screen</b> bearing the cinematic image and also representing a circus big-top. This set design serves to render the entire story and principle of Laterna magika.” The production’s creators included the founder of Czech Black Theatre, Jiří Srnec, the designers Zdenek Seydl, Eva and Jan Švankmajer, the choreographers František Pokorný, Vlastimil Jílek and Karel Vrtiška, the musician Oldřich F. Korte, and other artists. At {{the beginning of the}} 1970s, Laterna magika launched permanent collaboration with the cameraman Emil Sirotek. In 2013, the cinematographic material of Wonderful Circus was digitised; to date the production has been performed more than 6,200 times.|$|E
5000|$|Successfully [...] "setting a screen" [...] in {{team sports}} such as {{basketball}} and water polo requires attention to position and timing. An offensive player will first establish position so that his teammate can move toward him. The teammate changes pace and direction, and cuts (moves or dribbles quickly) {{very close to the}} screening player. The defender who is covering the cutter will have to push into the screening player, or divert around, losing a few steps. In basketball and lacrosse, the offensive player setting the pick must remain stationary at the moment of contact with the defender, and allow the defensive player a [...] "reasonable opportunity" [...] to avoid the screen; a screen is illegal if the screener moves in order to make contact, and obtains an advantage; the result is an offensive foul in basketball and a technical foul in lacrosse. There must be illegal contact for a <b>moving</b> <b>screen</b> to be a foul; no illegal contact, no foul, no matter how much moving the screener does. If the screener holds, leans or moves into the defender to cause contact, this will result in a foul on the screener.|$|E

A boiler and boilerhouse would be located nearby to provide power for the hoist, <b>moving</b> <b>screens,</b> jigs, and crushers (although in more modern times this is supplied by electricity), along with an engine house (to house the engine for the hoist), pumps and pumphouse (to supply the coal washing machines with water), and headframe (for the hoist).

5000|$|Villa {{incorporates}} {{many traditional}} Japanese ideas. One example of Katsura's use of traditional ideas is {{its use of}} raised floors with tatami mats covering them. Tatami are mats approximately 3 feet by 6 feet in length that are not only used as the floors of the villa, but are also used to define the dimensions of each individual room and the house as a whole. [...] At Katsura, the mats are used to create the sprawling and pinwheel-like plan that it has today. The terraces and porches created by {{the arrangement of the}} tatami mats provide opportunities to view the landscape and link interior spaces with the outside world. The floors of each building of the site are also raised as well, which originally was derived from vernacular designs for granaries, as well as early imperial palaces. They serve the purpose of both keeping the floor dry while also giving hierarchy to the space. Another classic characteristic that the Katsura Imperial Villa utilizes is the use of screen walls (the shoji and the fusuma). In traditional Japanese Architecture, the shoji and the fusuma are used to separate the spaces created by the tatami mat into the various rooms of the house. The shoji is the generic term for the white and translucent screen door or wall that is reinforced with wooden lattice and can either be stationary, hanging, or sliding. The fusuma is a subcategory of the shoji and it is the white or painted <b>moving</b> <b>screen</b> partition used on the interior of the house. By moving the fusuma, when in conjunction with a stationary shoji, the resident is able to create new rooms within the architecture. For instance by moving one fusuma wall, one could transform two rooms into one large room and a small storage closet. In the Katsura Imperial Villa, the fusuma allows the rooms to change and open up to the natural world with exterior decks becoming extensions of the interior and framing views of the landscape. An example of this type of transformation is the moon viewing platform connected to the Old Shoin. [...] Besides these characteristics, there are many traditional Japanese ideas that are used in the Katsura Imperial Villa, like the decorative alcove (tokonoma), built-in desk (tsukeshoin) and square posts.|$|E

40|$|A. Summary of the results: 1. A {{dramatic}} and very consistent decrease in discrimination performance {{was observed at}} 45 º in all pigeons. 2. On average, birds needed 797 trials to achieve the criterion at 45 º, while up to 45 ° eccentricity, <b>moving</b> the <b>screen</b> by 7 ° required only 217 trials. B. Conclusions: 1. There is no information transfer from the frontal visual field to the lateral visual field. 2. Pigeons cannot generalize information from the tectofugal system into the thalamofugal system. C. Current experiment: We are currently running a second experiment: the screen is situated in the lateral visual field, at 90 º, during the training. After achieving the criterion, we move the screen from lateral to frontal in 7 º steps. Preliminary data indicate {{that there are no}} significant differences in performance while <b>moving</b> the <b>screen</b> from lateral to frontal. Therefore, our findings confirm that pigeons can generalize information from the thalamofugal system into the tectofugal system, but not vice versa...|$|R

40|$|A {{real image}} swept-volume {{volumetric}} display is developed. A piston type <b>moving</b> <b>screen</b> {{is used to}} obtain the desired volume. A commercially available DMD device is used to project 2 D slices of a 3 D frame.

Synchronization between the hardware and the software is achieved via a microcontroller. The overall system is capable of printing 12 3 D frames per second where a 3 D frame consists of 90 2 D slices with a resolution varying from 512 x 512 to 450 x 450 (approx. 20 M voxels per one 3 D frame).

30|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel method for displaying {{data obtained by}} three-dimensional medical imaging, by which the position and orientation of a freely movable screen are optically tracked and used in real time to select the current slice from the data set for presentation. With this method, which we call a “freely moving in-situ medical image”, the screen and imaged data are registered to a common coordinate system in space external to the user, at adjustable scale, and are available for free exploration. The three-dimensional image data occupy empty space, as if an invisible patient is being sliced by the <b>moving</b> <b>screen.</b> A behavioral study using real computed tomography lung vessel data established {{the superiority of the}} in situ display over a control condition with the same free exploration, but displaying data on a fixed screen (ex situ), with respect to accuracy in the task of tracing along a vessel and reporting spatial relations between vessel structures. A “freely moving in-situ medical image” display appears from these measures to promote spatial navigation and understanding of medical data.|$|E

Further results indicate lack of single benchmark of public debt to GDP across all selected countries. Interestingly different countries appear with different optimal values (ranging from 61 to 88 %) of public debt to GDP which may trigger vulnerability to crisis.
