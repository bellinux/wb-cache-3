500|$|Kovalainen's {{failure to}} score, {{combined}} with the two Ferraris making the top three, meant that Ferrari extended their lead over McLaren in the Constructors' Championship from seven to 11points. Massa said Ferrari had succeeded in the race: [...] "I think for the Drivers' Championship it was not fantastic but for the Constructors' it was very good." [...] Kubica's sixth place at the Grand Prix ruled out any chance of claiming the Drivers' Championship.

500|$|Case, who had {{previously}} worked on the soap operas General Hospital and As the World Turns, was cast in August 1994. She was selected {{from a group of}} six other possible recasts after a screen testing with co-star Joshua Morrow, and began airing on September 7, 1994. Initially, Case believed she would only be playing the role for a maximum of six months. Of her casting, she stated: [...] "Not only is this <b>my</b> <b>third</b> soap, but I'm also the third actress {{to play the role of}} Sharon Collins. So, if three times is the charm, this should be it." [...] The actress wanted to [...] "breathe new life" [...] into the role and make it her own. In 2003, Case was off-screen from February 17 to May 1, during contract negotiations. These were resolved that April, when she signed a new contract to remain on the show for another four years, until 2007. Case revealed that while she considered leaving the series, [...] "I would not have been negotiating if I did not want to come back. I've always had a great story to play. I love the way they write Sharon. It was just a matter of hammering out the deal points." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2000, Brooks was {{declared}} bankrupt by the Federal Court in Perth {{after failing to}} repay a 14,941.64 debt to BankWest. In May 2001, the police raided Brooks' Perth home and found a metre-high cannabis plant. Brooks claimed that the plant belonged to a friend, and then {{announced that he would}} be leaving the state. Having moved to South Australia in 2003, Brooks started Local, which he billed as the state's leading lifestyle magazine. The venture was run solely by him and his wife, and was dominated by advertising. Journalist Peter FitzSimons criticised the lack of grammar checking and copyediting, citing a quote from Kieren Perkins, which was rendered thus in the publication: [...] "I was over the moon. Winning is something you strive to do but when I consider all the factors being married two children twenty seven years of age competing in <b>my</b> <b>third</b> Games and I broke fifteen minutes twice in two days it really was quite outstanding and whichever way you cut it Grant Hackett was just the next generation of swimmer [...]" [...] Brooks stood 200cm and weighed 95kg during his career, but {{in the early part of}} the 21st century fought a battle with obesity, after ballooning to 150kg. As of 2007, he had lost substantial weight and fought off his alcohol problems.|$|E

500|$|Despite this, {{shortly after}} the British race McLaren's {{experienced}} team manager Teddy Mayer decided not to continue with Villeneuve for the following year. His explanation was that Villeneuve [...] "was looking as though {{he might be a}} bit expensive" [...] and that Patrick Tambay, the team's eventual choice for 1978, was showing similar promise. Villeneuve was left with no solid options for 1978, although Canadian Walter Wolf, for whom Villeneuve had driven in Can-Am racing, considered giving him a drive at Wolf Racing. Rumours circulated that Villeneuve was one of several drivers in whom Ferrari's team was interested, and in August 1977 he flew to Italy to meet Enzo Ferrari, who was immediately reminded of the pre-war European champion Tazio Nuvolari: [...] "When they presented me with this 'piccolo Canadese' (little Canadian), this minuscule bundle of nerves, I immediately recognised in him the physique of Nuvolari and said to myself, let's give him a try." [...] Ferrari was satisfied with Villeneuve's promise after a session at Ferrari's Fiorano test track, despite the Canadian making many mistakes and setting relatively slow times, and Villeneuve signed to drive for Ferrari in the last two races of the 1977 season and the 1978 season. Villeneuve later remarked that: [...] "If someone said to me that you can have three wishes, my first would have been to get into racing, my second to be in Formula 1, <b>my</b> <b>third</b> to drive for Ferrari..." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} 2000s Pryce starred {{and participated in}} a variety of movies, such as The Affair of the Necklace (2001), Unconditional Love (2002), What a Girl Wants (2003), and Terry Gilliam's aborted project, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. While the success of some of these films was variable, the 2001 London stage {{production}} of My Fair Lady and his portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins was acclaimed by observers. This production turned out to be very stressful for Pryce because Martine McCutcheon, who portrayed Eliza Doolittle, was sick during much of the show's run. McCutcheon was replaced by her understudy Alexandra Jay, who would also fall sick hours before a performance, forcing her understudy, Kerry Ellis, to take the lead. Pryce was understandably upset and on her first night introduced Ellis to the audience before the show by saying [...] "This will be your first Eliza, my second today and <b>my</b> <b>third</b> this week. Any member of the audience interested in playing Eliza can find applications at the door. Wednesday and Saturday matinee available." [...] Pryce ended up dealing with four Elizas during the course of 14 months. Despite the difficulty, the show was nominated for four Laurence Olivier Awards on 2001: Best Actress in a Musical for Martine McCutcheon, Outstanding Musical Production, Best Theatre Choreographer and Best Actor in a Musical for Pryce. Pryce lost to Philip Quast, although ironically McCutcheon won in her category having played fewer performances than any of her understudies. Pryce did express interest in doing My Fair Lady in New York, but when asked if he would do it with McCutcheon he said that [...] "there's as much chance of me getting a date with Julia Roberts as doing My Fair Lady in New York with Martine McCutcheon." ...|$|E
