40|$|Original {{observations}} on meiotic cells in 17 {{species of the}} genus Acantho-phyllum are reported. Of these, the chromosome numbers, for 8 taxa viz, A. laxiusculum, A. heratense, A. caespitosum, A. pachycephalum, A. khuzistan-icum, A. mucronatum, A. verticillatum and A. crassinodum are new obser-vations. The basic chromosome numbers for the genus are x = 14 and x = 15. Three ploidy levels were observed for x = 15, diploidy (2 n = 2 x = 30), tetraploidy (2 n = 4 x = 60) and hexaploidy (2 n = 6 x = 90). Comparison of the morphological characters, chiasma average and chromosome conguration have shown some similarities between three tetraploid species of A. micro-cephalum, A. mucronatum and A. verticillatum and two hexaploid species of A. crassinodum and A. glandulosum. A. caespitosum is quite dierent from the others, especially in chromosome number (n = 14) and the <b>morphology</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflorescence.</b> Therefore, it seems that this taxon should {{be placed in a}} new section.

All <b>inflorescences</b> in Valerianaceae are understood as modifications of one basic form, the thyrse. It is gratifying to note that forms <b>of</b> <b>inflorescences,</b> described in systematical works as for instance 1) capitate or interruptedly spicate (Plectritis), 2) compound dichasium, dichotomous throughout (cymoid Valeriana spp.), or dichotomously branched inflorescence (Valerianella), 3) ‘rispig bis fast trugdoldig’ (Phuodendron), in reality all are variations on one theme, the decussate mono-, to pleiothyrse, i. e. a simple to compound inflorescence with a racemous primary axis and cymous lateral axes. The transformations take place first of all by a favoured development of lateral axes on definite heights of the main axis (‘basi-mesotoner, akrotoner Förderungssinn’) and secondly {{by the number of}} flowers developing and the more or less pronounced tendency to form monochasia. Moreover, different forms such as loose panicles, umbels, glomerules, heads and even nearly simple racemes (Aretiastrum), originate by extension or reduction of axes of some or all orders...|$|R

40|$|Inflorescence and floral {{morphology}} {{and development}} were investigated in Aragoa (Plantaginaceae) and related genera. Each <b>inflorescence</b> <b>of</b> Aragoa is a reduced, axillary raceme, {{on which the}} actinomorphic floral apices generally arise successively. The <b>inflorescences</b> <b>of</b> Aragoa and Plantago are polytelic and lateral. The five sepals emerge from the abaxial to the adaxial side of the floral apex, but at maturity, the calyx is actinomorphic. The four stamens arise simultaneously and before emergence of the petals. The four petals emerge unidirectionally united, but the corolla becomes actinomorphic. Aestivation is cochlear ascendent. The two united carpels initiate simultaneously. The abaxial-adaxial inception of the calyx and corolla during early floral development in genera such as Aragoa, Digitalis, Plantago, and Veronica may indicate that the zygomorphic condition is ancestral in those genera. The tetramerous corolla, which is actinomorphic during middle and late development, {{and the presence of}} four stamens are possible synapomophies of the clade (Aragoa þ Plantago). Pentamery of the calyx and corolla appears to be plesiomorphic in the broader Aragoa- Angelonia clade.

Ferdinand von Mueller described the plant in 1861, thus finally providing the plant with a name.

The accessions from Embrapa Germplasm Bank of Tropical flowers were evaluated for 21 morphological and phenological characteristics and post-harvest longevity.

The plants have slow development as typical from members of this family and and the production of leaves per year ranged between 6. 6 (A. plowmanii) to 10. 5 (A. bonplandii), which might be increased with the improvement of cultivation aspects, with an emphasis on spacing, plant management and fertilization.

40|$|In {{the family}} of Bromeliaceae it is {{established}} that flower induction is promoted by using ethylene or the ethylene precursor 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -caboxylic acid (ACC). However an adequate developmental stage of the plant is required to be susceptive for this flowering treatment. On the other hand younger and hence more compact plants are more desired for marketing. In this paper the possibilities of early flowering induction were investigated. Vriesea ‘Ginger’ plants in different stages of development (15, 18, 22, 30, 38, and 52 weeks of greenhouse growth) were subjected to applications with ethylene or ACC. The minimal age required for both treatments to induce flowering was 18 weeks. This was also reflected in the endogenous ACC evolution in young leaves and meristems from vegetative plants which show a considerable increase from 18 weeks on, suggesting that the plants leave the juvenility status around 18 weeks and become prone to flowering induction. Anthesis took place 124 days after flower induction for all developmental stages and treatments independent of plant age. The <b>morphology</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inflorescence</b> (inflorescence’s height and branch number per plant) was independent of the flower induction treatment but was linked with the developmental stage of the plants {{at the moment of}} induction.

40|$|Summary: Dactylanthus taylorii, a root {{parasite}} in {{the family}} Balanophoraceae, is New Zealand’s only fully parasitic flowering plant. It grows attached {{to the roots of}} a wide range of hardwood trees and shrubs, often in fire-induced secondary forest on the margin of podocarp-hardwood forest. It is inconstantly dioecious with a skewed sex ratio of approximately 5 : 1 male to female inflorescences. The inflorescences, especially the males, contain a large quantity of nectar, up to 1. 6 ml, and can produce 0. 5 ml per day for 10 days. The <b>morphology</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inflorescences,</b> the quantity and chemistry of the nectar, time-lapse video monitoring and other evidence suggest that the Dactylanthus flowers are adapted for pollination by short-tailed bats. Ship rats are also effective pollinators but occasionally destroy the inflorescences. Kiore completely destroyed all the inflorescences observed on Little Barrier Island in 1992 and 1993, although some seed was found there in 1991. Dactylanthus plants have been successfully cultivated by sowing seeds close to the roots of broadleaf plants. Germination was very slow with the highest rates occurring nearly five years after the seed was sown. Further research is needed to clarify the role of fungal hyphae found inside the cells of a young plant and that of the sheath processes which may assist vegetative reproduction. Video monitoring provided evidence that the introduced possum, by browsing the inflorescences, threatens the survival of Dactylanthus at most North Island sites.

40|$|Serotiny is a {{mechanism}} for storing propagules on plants, so that seed dispersal can be maximised {{after the death of}} aerial parts of plants or to take advantage of conditions beneficial to establishment. In fire-prone vegetation, regeneration of new plants after fire is mostly from seeds that are stored in the soil or on the plant. These traits are generally consistent within a genus. However, in Conospermum, a genus of shrubs that mostly occur in fire-prone vegetation and in which most species have soil-stored seeds, two species exhibit an unusual serotinous structure. We examined the <b>morphology</b> and anatomy <b>of</b> <b>inflorescences</b> and infructescences <b>of</b> C. capitatum and C. petiolare that were collected from natural vegetation in south-western Western Australia. Inflorescence and infructescence axes were sectioned and examined microscopically, fresh infructescences were heated in an oven to various temperatures for 2 min and the fruits from them sown in a germination trial. Some fruits were also treated with smoke chemicals. Both species have a low, dense growth form and retain the seed-like fruits in a serotinous structure formed by enlargement of the cortical cells <b>of</b> the <b>inflorescence</b> axis after flowering. The fruits can be effectively released from the plant only if the foliage is removed by a fire. For both species, the infructescence protects the fruits from heat up to 200 °C for 2 min and this is similar to protection afforded by woody cones in other serotinous species. C. capitatum requires either heat or smoke to cue germination, whereas C. petiolare requires no cue, as is found in most other serotinous species. A combination of morphological modification associated with allometry of the whole plant body and physiological changes to germination requirements shows that a series of complex changes may be needed to develop serotiny from non-serotinous antecedents...|$|R
