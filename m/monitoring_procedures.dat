25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the FDA's drug safety <b>monitoring</b> <b>procedures</b> was called into question after several approved drugs were shown to have serious side-effects. In September 2006, an Institute of Medicine report commissioned by the FDA found that its drug safety system is limited by inadequate funding, insufficient regulatory authority, {{and a lack of}} oversight by experts free of pharmaceutical industry ties.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the FDA has {{different}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>procedures</b> for substances {{depending on whether}} they are presented as drugs, food additives, food, or dietary supplements. Dietary supplements are eaten or taken by mouth, and are regulated in United States law {{as a type of}} food rather than a type of drug. Like food and unlike drugs, no government approval is required to make or sell dietary supplements; the manufacturer checks the safety of dietary supplements but the government does not; and rather than requiring risk–benefit analysis to prove that the product can be sold like a drug, risk–benefit analysis is only used to petition that food or a dietary supplement is unsafe and should be removed from market.|$|E

50|$|A process, like a {{class or}} monitor, has local variables, {{procedure}}s, and an initial statement, {{but has no}} procedure entries. The initial statement ordinarily executes forever, calling local procedures, class <b>procedures,</b> and <b>monitor</b> <b>procedures.</b> Processes communicate through <b>monitor</b> <b>procedures.</b> Language rules prevent deadlock by imposing a hierarchy on monitors. But nothing can prevent a monitor from erroneously forgetting to unblock a delayed process (by not calling continue) so the system can still effectively hang up through programming errors.|$|R

2500|$|On March 16, 2010, Time Warner Cable's {{transmission}} of their Kids on Demand and Kids Pre-School on Demand channels on systems in eastern North Carolina {{was interrupted by}} programming from the adult pay television channel Playboy TV for approximately two hours between 6:15a.m. and 8:15a.m./EDT, in which a group of nude women talked and posed in a sexually suggestive manner. This accidental display affected Time Warner's digital cable subscribers in four towns in the system's eastern North Carolina cluster, while other areas displayed a black screen. A Time Warner spokesperson {{said in a statement}} to Raleigh CBS affiliate WRAL, [...] "It was a technical malfunction that caused the wrong previews to be shown on our kids' on-demand channels. Unfortunately it hit at the worst possible time on the worst possible channels." [...] A Time Warner executive said normal <b>monitoring</b> <b>procedures</b> did not take effect because the glitch affected only a few areas.

2500|$|A Zotye M300 EV {{operating}} as a taxicab caught fire in Hangzhou, China, in April 2011. No one was injured {{as the driver}} and two passengers evacuated the electric car in time. Due to the incident, the city authorities decided to halt all electric taxis on safety concerns, 15 of which were M300 EVs out of a fleet of 30 electric taxis. The city's official investigation team found {{the cause of the}} fire was the car's defective battery pack due to lack of quality control during manufacturing. According to the investigation report, the battery pack problems include: leaking of battery cells; damage of the insulation between battery cells and the walls of the aluminum container in which the cells were stacked; short circuits occurred within certain containers and those involving supporting and connecting parts. One of the stronger short circuits ignited the car’s back seats. [...] The lead investigators said that [...] "...in sealing and packing the battery cells, in loading and unloading the battery stacks, insufficient attention had been paid to several safety factors; <b>monitoring</b> <b>procedures</b> had been inefficient or neglected in the process of manufacturing, battery charging/switching, and vehicle driving, failing to detect anomalies." [...] The report added that the battery cells on the car were made by Zhejiang Wanxiang Group.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>procedure</b> {{to detect a}} {{structural}} change from stationary to integrated behavior. When the procedure {{is applied to the}} errors of a relationship between integrated series it thus monitors a structural change from a cointegrating relationship to a spurious regression. The cointegration <b>monitoring</b> <b>procedure</b> is based on residuals from modified least squares estimation, using either Fully Modified, Dynamic or Integrated Modified OLS. The procedure is inspired by Chu et al. (1996) in that it is based on parameter estimation only on a pre-break ``calibration'' period rather than being based on sequential estimation over the full sample. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the procedures under the null, for (fixed and local) alternatives and in case of parameter changes. We also study the finite sample performance via simulations. An application to credit default swap spreads illustrates the potential usefulness of the procedure...|$|R

40|$|This paper shows a {{reliability}} analysis {{evaluation of the}} main frames {{of one of the}} most important Colombian bridges. The evaluation was carried out by employing the following techniques: geometrical detailing, mechanical tests, traffic counting, load deformation tests, structural calibration of the bridge model, instrumentation, electrical monitoring and numerical simulation. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>procedure</b> was implemented by a series of electronic sensors connected to the main frame bridge structure in multiple locations to measure and record data from the strain gages sensors. The purpose for employing the <b>monitoring</b> <b>procedure</b> described above was to compile real-time data to compare them with the design load (C- 40 - 95) established by the Colombian Seismic Code of Bridges Design. Overloads were found in some of the monitored frames. This fact compromises the bridge’s safety and stability and must be controlled immediately. Additionally, probability failure calculations were carried out and the results were that the structure safety ranges that assure stability and a lower risk condition were not found...|$|R
