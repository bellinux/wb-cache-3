In 1986, he appeared in a group show with Peter Halley, Ashley Bickerton, Ross Minoru Laing and Meyer Vaisman at Sonnabend Gallery in New York.

25|$|The third DLC, Painful Memories, was {{originally}} slated to launch in October, but was delayed to December 4, 2012. Four multiplayer maps are included – the Roscoe street subway map {{from the first}} game, the Hoboken dive Marty's Bar, a yacht level called Shoot First, and a Gang Wars map called Canal de Panama. Other additions include the IMG 5.56 and UAR-21 assault rifles, new avatars, and the Hangover Burst which makes enemies spawn with reduced stamina, health and blurred vision. The final DLC, titled Deathmatch <b>Made</b> <b>in</b> <b>Heaven,</b> was released on January 22, 2013. It adds four new multiplayer game modes: a survival mode called Dead Men Walking, Run and Stun, Marked Man and Time Attack, {{as well as a}} single player mini-game called New York Minute Arcade Challenge, which is very similar to the New York Minute minigames from previous iterations in the series. It also adds several new weapons and items, as well as a new Burst called Unstoppable, which adds to a player's defensive ability.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, May made {{significant}} changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist Jamie Moses on board to replace Mike Caswell. The other change made {{was in the}} backing vocals department, when Ryder, Stockley and Thompson were replaced with Catherine Porter and Shelley Preston. On 23 February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting Guns N' Roses and headlining a few dates. The tour would take them through North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. After the tour ended on 18 December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members Roger Taylor and John Deacon to work on tracks that became <b>Made</b> <b>in</b> <b>Heaven,</b> the final Queen studio album. The band took Mercury's solo album demos and last recordings, which he managed to perform in the studio after the album Innuendo was finished, and completed them with their additions both musically and vocally. Work on the album after Mercury's death originally began in 1992 by Deacon and May, but was left until a later date, due to other commitments.|$|E

"Amazing Grace", {{with the}} words written by Newton and joined with [...] "New Britain", the melody most {{currently}} associated with it, appeared {{for the first time}} in Walker's shape note tunebook Southern Harmony in 1847.

There was a rise at the point of confession, as though the author was stepping out into the open and making a bold declaration, but a corresponding fall when admitting his blindness." [...] Walker's collection was enormously popular, selling about 600,000 copies all over the U.S. when the total population was just over 20 million. Another shape note tunebook named The Sacred Harp (1844) by Georgia residents Benjamin Franklin White and Elisha J. King became widely influential and continues to be used.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{application}} of the 3 D cosmic shear method developed <b>in</b> <b>Heavens</b> et al. (2006) and the geometric shear-ratio analysis developed in Taylor et al. (2006), to the COMBO- 17 data set. 3 D cosmic shear {{has been used to}} analyse galaxies with redshift estimates from two random COMBO- 17 fields covering 0. 52 square degrees in total, providing a conditional constraint in the (sigma_ 8, Omega_m) plane as well as a conditional constraint on the equation of state of dark energy, parameterised by a constant w= p/rho c^ 2. The (sigma_ 8, Omega_m) plane analysis constrained the relation between sigma_ 8 and Omega_m to be sigma_ 8 (Omega_m/ 0. 3) ^{ 0. 57 +- 0. 19 }= 1. 06 + 0. 17 - 0. 16, in agreement with a 2 D cosmic shear analysis of COMBO- 17. The 3 D cosmic shear conditional constraint on w using the two random fields is w=- 1. 27 + 0. 64 - 0. 70. The geometric shear-ratio analysis has been applied to the A 901 / 2 field, which contains three small galaxy clusters. Combining the analysis from the A 901 / 2 field, using the geometric shear-ratio analysis, and the two random fields, using 3 D cosmic shear, w is conditionally constrained to w=- 1. 08 + 0. 63 - 0. 58. The errors presented in this paper are shown to agree with Fisher matrix predictions <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>Heavens</b> et al. (2006) and Taylor et al. (2006). When these methods are applied to large datasets, as expected soon from surveys such as Pan-STARRS and VST-KIDS, the dark energy equation of state could be constrained to an unprecedented degree of accuracy.

2500|$|In 1989 the Whitney Museum and its guest curator Marvin Heiferman asked Koons {{to make an}} artwork {{about the}} media on a {{billboard}} for the show [...] "Image World: Art and Media Culture".

Including works with such titles as Dirty Ejaculation and Ilonaʼs *******, the series of enormous grainy photographs printed on canvas, glassworks, and sculptures portrayed Koons and Staller in highly explicit sexual positions and created considerable controversy. The paintings of the series reference art from the Baroque and Rococo periods—among others, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Jean-Honoré Fragonard and François Boucher—and also draw upon the breakthroughs of early modern painters as Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} tabloids put a heavy {{emphasis on}} blood and gore.

[...] Advertisements, which were important for these newspapers, were often for soaps, various creams, ointments, and tonics.
