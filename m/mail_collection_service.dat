A new line was also constructed along Pinnacle Avenue (today known as South Clinton Avenue) in 1892. During this time, the railway experimented with color coding their various routes and painting the trolleys to match. Unfortunately, {{it was impossible to}} keep trolleys in captive service to their assigned route, and the color system was soon abandoned. With all lines electrified by 1894, the last horse car operated in Rochester in 1895.

Beginning in 1909, all <b>mail</b> <b>collection</b> boxes were painted {{a dark green}} to avoid confusion with emergency and fire equipment. [...] Dark green gave way to olive drab green after World War I, when the U.S. Army donated a large supply of olive drab green paint to the Post Office. Olive drab green subsequently became the standard color for all U.S. <b>mail</b> <b>collection</b> boxes until 1955. On 4 July 1955, Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield announced that the Post Office would begin painting all <b>mail</b> <b>collection</b> boxes in red, white, and blue to make them easily identifiable. Subsequently, the Post Office began painting <b>mail</b> <b>collection</b> boxes in red and blue, with white lettering. In 1971 the Post Office (now USPS) changed <b>mail</b> <b>collection</b> boxes to the current USPS Dark Blue with contrasting lettering. The coming of the automobile also influenced U.S. mailbox design, and in the late 1930s, an extension chute or [...] "snorkel" [...] to drive-up curbside collection boxes was adopted.|$|R
