40|$|This {{presentation}} {{will explain}} the invaluable {{research that has}} been performed by the Iowa Department of Transportation regarding the reduction of sediment accumulation in <b>multi-barrel</b> <b>culverts.</b> This promising flume research (IHRB TR- 596) determined that the construction of “wedges” in the flared inlet aprons can replicate the approach channel geometry and minimize the accumulation of sediment in <b>multi-barrel</b> <b>culverts.</b> The wedges have been constructed for a triple RCB along IA 1 in Iowa City for site evaluation since December, 2012. The site is under continuous monitoring for sediment load and discharge to monitor the success/failure of the wedges at a site. A site visit of this important research is planned during the conference...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increased}} interest in constructing Pre-Cast (PC) Twin and Triple Reinforced Concrete Box (RCB) culverts in Iowa due to the efficiency associated with their production in controlled environment and decrease of the construction time at the culvert sites. The design of the <b>multi-barrel</b> PC <b>culverts</b> is, however, based on guidelines for single-barrel cast-inplace (CIP) culverts despite that the PC and CIP culverts have different geometry. There is scarce information for multiplebarrel RCB culverts in general and even fewer on culverts with straight wingwalls as those designed by Iowa DOT. Overall, the transition from CIP to PC culverts requires additional information for improving the design specifications currently in use. Motivated {{by the need to}} fill these gaps, an experimental study was undertaken by IIHR-Hydroscience & Engineering. The goals of the study are to document flow performance curves and head losses at the culvert entrance for a various culvert geometry, flow conditions, and settings. The tests included single-, double- and triple-barrel PC and CIP culverts with two span-to-rise ratios set on mild and steep slopes. The tests also included optimization of the culvert geometry entrance by considering various configurations for the top bevel. The overall conclusion of the study is that by and large the current Iowa DOT design specifications for CIP culverts can be used for <b>multi-barrel</b> PC <b>culvert</b> design. For unsubmerged flow conditions the difference in the hydraulic performance curves and headloss coefficients for PC and CIP culverts are within the experimental uncertainty. Larger differences (specified by the study) are found for submerged conditions when the flow is increasingly constricted at the entrance in the culvert. The observed differentiation is less important for <b>multi-barrel</b> <b>culverts</b> as the influence of the wingwalls decreases with the increase of the number of barrels...|$|R
40|$|Recessed {{culverts}} {{are often}} installed in Minnesota to facilitate aquatic organism passage (AOP) {{by providing a}} natural streambed through the culvert. The least expensive option when installing a recessed culvert is to allow the culvert to fill in with sediment naturally over time; however, previous field studies suggest that in many cases, sediment fails to deposit within the culvert. The objective {{of this research was}} to understand the function of a culvert set below the streambed elevation under various sediment transport conditions. Laboratory experiments were designed to assess the performance of recessed culverts across a range of geomorphic characteristics representative of Minnesota streams. These experiments explored the functionality of a culvert that is prefilled with sediment representative of the stream {{as a part of the}} installation process against one that is empty after installation and assessed the potential for headcutting and downstream degradation. The experiments evaluated the need for artificial roughness installations within recessed culverts in high gradient streams. Three sets of experiments were conducted examining: 1) the effect of sediment grain size, slope, and flow hydrograph on sediment transport through a single recessed box culvert, 2) the effect of bed roughness structures on sediment stability in a single recessed box culvert in high-gradient streams, and 3) the effect of culvert offset and skew on sedimentation in <b>multi-barrel</b> <b>culverts.</b> Minnesota Department of Transportation Research Services & Librar...|$|R
