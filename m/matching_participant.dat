40|$|Abstract—The {{explosive}} growth of mobile-connected and location-aware devices {{makes it possible}} to have a new way of establishing trust relationships, which we coin as spatiotemporal matching. In particular, a mobile user could very easily maintain his spatiotemporal profile recording his continuous whereabouts in time, and the level of his spatiotemporal profile matching that of the other user can be translated into the level of trust they two can have in each other. Since spatiotemporal profiles contain very sensitive personal information, privacy-preserving spatiotemporal matching is needed to ensure that as little information as possible about the spatiotemporal profile of either <b>matching</b> <b>participant</b> is disclosed beyond the matching result. We propose a cryptographic solution based on Private Set Intersection Cardinality and a more efficient non-cryptographic solution involving a novel use of the Bloom filter. We thoroughly analyze both solutions and compare their efficacy and efficiency via detailed simulation studies. I...|$|E

Methods: This project was conducted {{as part of an}} ongoing community-based surveillance study in New York City to identify viral etiologies of acute respiratory infection. In January 2014, following sample collection by trained research assistants, participants with acute respiratory infection from 30 households subsequently collected and returned a self-collected/parent-collected nasal swab via mail. Self/parental swabs corresponding with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction primary research samples were analyzed. Results: Nearly all (96. 8 %, n= 30 / 31) households agreed to participate; 100 % reported returning the sample and 29 were received (median time: 8 days). Most (18; 62. 1 %) of the primary research samples were positive. For eight influenza-positive research samples, seven (87. 5 %) self-swabs were also positive. For ten other respiratory pathogen-positive research samples, eight (80. 0 %) self-swabs were positive. Sensitivity of self-swabs for any respiratory pathogen was 83. 3 % and 87. 5 % for influenza, and specificity for both was 100 %. There was no relationship between level of education and concordance of results between positive research samples and their <b>matching</b> <b>participant</b> swab. Conclusion: In this pilot study, self-swabbing was feasible and valid in a low-income, urban minority population.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of static or dynamic stretching on hip kinematics and kinetics during intermittent sprinting. To achieve this aim, intermittent sprint athletes were asked to complete either a static or dynamic stretch, followed by a repeated-sprint protocol. Hip joint kinematics and performance measures were evaluated during the sprint, including changes that occurred in these variables over the course of the sprint protocol. In addition, hip flexion torque was measured with an isokinetic dynamometer. Ten male (age = 25 ± 2. 3 years, 175 ± 3. 2 cm, 76. 2 ± 2. 7 kg) and female (age = 20 ± 1 years, 166 ± 1. 3 cm, 60 ± 1. 1 kg) recreational soccer players were recruited from the Las Vegas community. Participants reported to the Sports Injury Research Center for data collection on two days separated by at least 48 hours. Before providing consent (IRB Protocol # 724261 - 2), participants were able to ask any questions and familiarize themselves with the isokinetic dynamometer. Data collection consisted of: 1) 5 -minute walking warm up on a treadmill at a preferred speed, 2) baseline hip flexion torque measurements, 3) either a static or dynamic stretch, 4) post-stretch torque measurements, 5) 6 x 20 -meter sprints with 2 minutes rest between each trial, and 6) post-sprint torque measurements. On day two, participants completed the alternate stretch condition (step 3). Hip flexion torque output values extracted using Biodex Software were entered into Microsoft Excel and peak torque values were identified for each measurement period (baseline, post stretch, post sprint) for each condition (dynamic stretch or static stretch). These values were analyzed using a 2 (stretch) x 3 (time), repeated measures factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni adjustment using SPSS for Windows (IBM, v. 22, Armonk, NY). Multiple comparison post-hoc analysis was completed using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA and paired t-tests. Sprint times were recorded during collection and entered into Microsoft Excel, where the average sprint time for each condition was calculated, as well as the time difference between sprints 1 and 6. Two separate paired samples t-tests were completed for average sprint speed and T 1 -T 6 differences for each condition with significance set to α= 0. 05. Hip angular velocity was calculated during the initial swing phase using MaxTRAQ software (Innovision Systems, Inc., Columbiaville, MI). Initial swing was defined as toe-off to maximum knee flexion. These identifying positions were determined using the markers placed prior to data collection. Angular position data for the hip and knee were filtered with a zero lag, low-pass, 4 th order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 12 Hz. From the angular position data, instantaneous angular velocity was calculated for each frame that comprised the initial swing phase of sprints 1 and 6. The length in frames of the phase was normalized by percent, and the phase percent at which peak instantaneous velocity occurred was noted. Paired samples t-tests were completed for both peak instantaneous velocity and percent phase of peak instantaneous velocity for each condition with significance set to α= 0. 05. Results of statistical analysis yielded no significant results. However, angular velocity values and torque measurements were greater following dynamic stretch and sprint times were faster. The lack of statistical significance may be explained by several factors, specifically large variability within a small sample. Future research would benefit by increasing the sample size, <b>matching</b> <b>participant</b> experience and playing level, and potentially increasing the number and length of stretches performed...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The primary {{objective}} was to assess whether patients with knee osteoarthritis and whom undergo arthroscopic meniscectomy have an increased risk for future knee replacement surgery. DESIGN: Data used {{were obtained from the}} Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) study. SETTING: Participants were enrolled, in four clinical centers, between February 2004 and May 2006 and were followed up on an annual basis up to and including 108 -months from enrollment. PARTICIPANTS: 4674 participants (58. 4 % female), aged 45 - 79, of all ethnic groups, who had, and those who were at high risk for developing, symptomatic knee osteoarthritis were included, of which 3337 (71. 4 %) were included in the final follow up visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hazard ratio of knee replacement surgery for participants who underwent arthroscopic meniscectomy during follow up compared to propensity score <b>matched</b> <b>participants</b> who did not undergo arthroscopic meniscectomy during follow up. RESULTS: 335 participants underwent arthroscopic meniscectomy during follow up, of which 63 (18. 8 %) underwent knee replacement surgery in the same knee. Of the 335 propensity score <b>matched</b> <b>participants</b> 38 (11. 1 %) underwent knee replacement surgery during follow up. Results from the Cox-proportional hazards model demonstrated that the hazard ratio of knee replacement surgery was 3. 03 (95 % CI (1. 67 - 5. 26)) for participants who underwent arthroscopic meniscectomy relative to the propensity score <b>matched</b> <b>participants</b> who did not undergo arthroscopic meniscectomy.

However, limited in vivo studies have explored the relationship between current depressive symptoms and cortical Aβ in patients with MCI and AD. Our study, using a large sample of 455 patients with MCI and 153 patients with AD from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiatives, investigated whether current depressive {{symptoms are}} related to cortical Aβ deposition. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale and Neuropsychiatric Inventory-depression/dysphoria. Cortical Aβ was quantified using positron emission tomography with the Aβ probe(18) F-florbetapir (AV- 45). (18) F-florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio (AV- 45 SUVR) from the frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal regions was estimated. A global AV- 45 SUVR, defined as the average of frontal, cingulate, precuneus, and parietal cortex, was also used. We observed that current depressive symptoms were not related to cortical Aβ, after controlling for potential confounds, including history of major depression. We also observed that there was no difference in cortical Aβ between <b>matched</b> <b>participants</b> with high and low depressive symptoms, as well as no difference between <b>matched</b> <b>participants</b> with the presence and absence of depressive symptoms.
