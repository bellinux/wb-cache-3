50|$|The {{metallic}} pinktoe is a tarantula with {{a diagonal}} leg span of approximately 13 - 15 cm. The metallic pinktoe is noted for iridescent sheen, green to dark blue prosoma, {{and the white}} tipped hairs on the opisthosoma. Males and females look the same until the ultimate (final) molt of the males. At this point, males will gain embolus on the pedipalps and tibial apophysis (also called tibial spurs or tibial hooks), used for mating. The <b>metallic</b> <b>pinktoe</b> <b>tarantula</b> is an arboreal species that will often construct a tube web in the tree canopy.|$|E

50|$|The mature <b>pinktoe</b> <b>tarantula</b> has a dark-colored {{body and}} pinkish feet, hence its name. Juvenile specimens, however, have pinkish bodies and dark-colored feet. <b>Pinktoe</b> <b>tarantulas</b> undergo a {{reversal}} in their coloration {{as they approach}} adulthood at 4-5 years. They are sit-and-wait predators, with limited activity.|$|R

50|$|Avicularia avicularia, {{sometimes}} called the <b>pinktoe</b> <b>tarantula,</b> is a species of tarantula native from Costa Rica to Brazil and the southern Caribbean. This species is {{sometimes called}} the Guyana pinktoe, common pinktoe, or South American pinktoe.|$|R

50|$|They {{are known}} to lure in their victims {{through the process of}} stationization, the act of {{remaining}} in a trance-like state until moment of attack. A full grown <b>pinktoe</b> <b>tarantula</b> can grow up to six inches in length. Their first reaction when threatened is usually to run or leap away, but they may react defensively if provoked (as with any theraphosid). Their venom is considered mild, even compared to other new-world tarantulas.|$|R
2500|$|Reaction and {{the degree}} of {{irritation}} to a defensive urticating hair barrage can vary tremendously, based on the species in question. [...] Some, such as those of the Chilean rose tarantula (Grammastola rosea) and the <b>Pinktoe</b> <b>tarantula</b> (Avicularia avicularia), are fairly mild and innocuous to humans. [...] Others, such as those of the Brazilian giant white knee tarantula (Acanthoscurria geniculata), are moderately irritating. [...] Still others, such as the Goliath Birdeater (Theraphosa blondi), are far more severe. [...] These hairs can result in painful rashes, and have been likened to sharp shards of fiberglass.|$|R
5000|$|Avicularia juruensis is {{a species}} of spider in the family Theraphosidae, found in South America (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil). Avicularia urticans was brought into {{synonymy}} in 2017. It has been given the English name Amazonian pink toe spider. Under the synonym Avicularia urticans, it {{is also known as}} the Peruvian <b>pinktoe</b> <b>tarantula.</b> It is a large mygalomorph spider, with a maximum body length over [...] and the longest fully extended leg about [...] Like other species in the genus Avicularia, specimens under this name are sold as pets, although their identity has not been confirmed by taxonomic studies.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>metallic</b> <b>pinktoe</b> {{is often}} kept as a pet and is popular with {{tarantula}} keepers for its metallic hue. Typical care requirements include a [...] tank with 6 - 10 cm of substrate such as peat moss or coco-husk. Since this species is arboreal, height {{is more important}} than floor space, and they should be provided with branches, plants, or cork bark to climb on. They require relatively high humidity and should be provided with an open water dish. Tarantulas are generally offered 1-2 prey items (such as crickets) once weekly, although they can typically survive for several weeks without food.
