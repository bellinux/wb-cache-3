40|$|A {{prominent}} peak in {{the electron}} temperature of the topside ionosphere is observed beneath the <b>magnetospheric</b> <b>cleft.</b> The present study uses DE- 2 data obtained in the Northern Winter Hemisphere to investigate this phenomenon. First, the dependence of the location and magnitude of the temperature peak on the magnetic activity is determined. Next, using a superposed epoch analysis, the mean latitudinal profile of the temperature enhancement is derived. The {{results of the present}} study are compared primarily with those obtained by Titheridge&nbsp;(1976), but also with more recent observations and theoretical predictions...|$|E
40|$|Two rocket experiments, {{performed}} in January 1975, investigated convection of plasma formed by solar photoionization of barium {{injected into the}} northern <b>magnetospheric</b> <b>cleft</b> at 13 km/s upward and parallel to the local geomagnetic field. Plasma convection was demonstrated from the cleft's poleward region, directly into and across the polar cap, and possibly into the convection system of the nightside auroral electrojet; plasma injected centrally within the cleft under quiet magnetic conditions remained in the cleft convection system for at least 22 min and revealed a highly structured E-field over about 600 km of longitudinal extent. Cleft location agreed with that predicted by ionosondes...|$|E
40|$|On Dec. 6, 1974, a Black Brant VD rocket was {{launched}} from Cape Parry, N. W. T., into the dayside <b>magnetospheric</b> <b>cleft.</b> The prime launch criterion was {{the detection of}} 6300 -A emission by two ground-based scanning photometers, but support was provided by two ionosondes. The payload passed through a narrow region of soft electron precipitation, a broader region of enhanced electron densities, and a similarly broad region of O I 5577 -A and 6300 -A emission. At apogee (236 km), the payload had not penetrated into the 5200 -A emission, which had a very sharp equatorward boundary and extended far into the polar cap, presumably {{as a result of}} antisunward convection.

40|$|The auroral O I 7990 -A multiplet {{intensity}} distribution {{has been observed}} {{by means of a}} 2 -m grille spectrometer and a Fabry-Perot interferometer during 1977 and 1982, respectively, in Alaska. Grille spectrometer results indicate a nonstatistical distribution in the excited state, consistent with the preferential scattering of the O I 989 -A EUV emission and in accord with recent radiative transfer calculations. A comparison of O I 7990 -A intensities measured on the nightside with those from dayside <b>magnetospheric</b> <b>cleft</b> aurora shows a cascade contribution to the O I 8446 -A line, and ultimately to the O I 1304 -A transition, that depends on the altitude of the aurora. This is attributed to the greater radiative enhancement of O I 989 -A at low altitude, and the correspondingly enhanced probability for branching from the 3 s-prime to the 3 p level in atomic O...|$|E
40|$|Photometers on the ISIS-II {{spacecraft}} {{provide a}} view of the atomic oxygen 5577 -A and 6300 -A emissions and the N 2 (+) 3914 -A emission detected as dayside aurora in the <b>magnetospheric</b> <b>cleft</b> region. The 6300 -A emission forms a continuous and permanent band across the noon sector, at about 78 deg invariant latitude, with a defined region of maximum intensity that is never less than 2 kR (uncorrected for albedo) and is centered near magnetic noon. There are significant differences in the intensity patterns on either side of noon and their responses to geomagnetic activity. Discrete 3914 -A auroral forms appear within this region at preferred locations that cannot be precisely specified but which tend to the poleward edge of the 6300 -A emission in the evening and the equatorward edge in the morning, where {{the difference between the two}} emissions is greatest. It is concluded that the discrete auroras observed by all-sky cameras in the day sector follow the 6300 -A emission through the cleft region, though a definite cleft boundary is not defined...|$|E
40|$|During December 1974 and January 1975, the {{northern}} <b>magnetospheric</b> <b>cleft</b> was monitored by ionosondes at Cape Parry and Sachs Harbor, Northwest Territories, Canada, {{in support of}} rocket shots into the cleft. Ionograms were taken nominally at 15 -min intervals but as rapidly as two per minute during times of particular interest. Analysis of 5 days of data shows the ionosphere at cleft latitudes to be very complex and dynamic. The ionograms often show considerable structure and can change appearance significantly in a minute or two. The cleft at times appears to move equatorward in response either to a southward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field or to the occurrence of geomagnetic disturbances. This response is {{in agreement with the}} conclusions of previous satellite studies. Behavior contrary to this generalization is not uncommon, however, and therefore it may not always hold on time scales considerably shorter than the satellite orbital period of at least 1 hour. The rate of the cleft's motion may vary from about 0. 05 to 0. 5 deg/min...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{observations}} from the Dynamics Explorer 1 (DE- 1) spacecraft {{have shown that}} the dayside auroral zone is an important source of very low-energy superthermal O^+ ions for the polar magnetosphere. When observed at 2000 - to 5000 -km altitude, the core of the O^+ distribution exhibits transverse heating to energies on the order of 10 eV, significant upward heat flux, and subsonic upward flow at significant flux levels exceeding 10 ^ 8 cm^{- 2 }s^{- 1 }. The term "upwelling ions" has been adopted to label these flows, which stand out {{in sharp contrast to the}} light ion polar wind flows observed in the same altitude range in the polar cap and subauroral magnetosphere. We have chosen a typical upwelling ion event for detailed study, correlating retarding ion mass spectrometer observations of the low-energy plasma with energetic ion observations and local electromagnetic field observations. The upwelling ion signature is colocated with the <b>magnetospheric</b> <b>cleft</b> as marked by precipitating energetic magnetosheath ions. The apparent ionospheric heating is clearly linked with the magnetic field signatures of strong field-aligned currents in the vicinity of the dayside polar cap boundary. Electric field and ion plasma measurements indicate that a very strong and localized convection channel or jet exists coincident with the other signatures of this event. These observations indicate that transverse ion heating to temperatures on the order of 10 ^ 5 K in the 2000 - to 5000 -km ionosphere is an important factor in producing heavy ion outflows into the polar magnetosphere. This result contrasts with recent suggestions that electron heating to temperatures of order 10 ^ 4 K is the most important parameter with regard to O^+ outflow...|$|E
