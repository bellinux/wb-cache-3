5|$|We {{were always}} trying to pry assets out of the Air Force at times and places they didn't want to go. You had to push'em, cajole'em, at times {{threaten}} them... <b>My</b> <b>people</b> were {{always trying to}} corrupt the process because the process itself simply was not structured for our kind of war... It was a continual frustration.|$|E
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to <b>my</b> <b>people,</b> yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E

25|$|This {{country has}} been good to me. It gave me {{everything}} I have. I have never come out for any candidate before but I think Wendell L. Willkie {{will give us a}} square deal.

25|$|Because <b>my</b> <b>people,</b> {{about forty}} {{thousand}} in number, have {{in no way}} been consulted by those, three thousand in number, who claim the right to destroy the independence of Hawaii. <b>My</b> <b>people</b> constitute four-fifths of the legally qualified voters of Hawaii, and excluding those imported for the demands of labor, about the same proportion of the inhabitants.|$|E

25|$|After {{about a year}} {{some trouble}} arose {{between them and the}} Indians, and I took the war path as a warrior, not as a chief. I had not been wronged, but some of <b>my</b> <b>people</b> had been, and I fought with my tribe; for the {{soldiers}} and not the Indians were at fault.|$|E
25|$|Because the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, and an envoy {{commissioned}} by them reported in official documents that my government was unlawfully coerced by the forces, diplomatic and naval, of the United States; that I {{was at the}} date of their investigations the constitutional ruler of <b>my</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

25|$|Because said treaty ignores, {{not only}} the civic rights of <b>my</b> <b>people,</b> but, further, the {{hereditary}} property of their chiefs. Of the 4,000,000 acres composing the territory said treaty offers to annex, 1,000,000 or 915,000 acres has in no way been heretofore recognized as other than the private property of the constitutional monarch, subject to a control in now way differing from other items of a private estate.|$|E

25|$|I didn't write any {{songs in}} Henderson, {{but it was}} there I {{realized}} that experiences I had had, things I had seen and heard could be set down {{in a kind of}} music characteristic of my race. There I learned to appreciate the music of <b>my</b> <b>people</b> … then the blues were born, because from that day on, I started thinking about putting my own experience down in that particular kind of music.|$|E
25|$|It's like St. Patrick's Day. I {{came out}} of respect for what <b>my</b> <b>people</b> are doing, not because I believe it will do any good. I thought it would do some good in the beginning.

25|$|On 18 April 1638 Lilburne was flogged with a three-thonged whip on {{his bare}} back, {{as he was}} dragged by his hands tied {{to the rear of}} an ox cart from Fleet Prison to the pillory at Westminster. He was then forced to stoop in the pillory where he still managed to {{campaign}} against his censors, while distributing more unlicensed literature to the crowds. He was then gagged. Finally he was thrown in prison. He was taken back to the court and again imprisoned. During his imprisonment in Fleet he was cruelly treated. While in prison he however managed to write and to get printed in 1638 an account of his own punishment styled The Work of the Beast and in 1639 an apology for separation from the church of England, entitled Come out of her, <b>my</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
