25|$|Activity theory, in {{contrast}} to disengagement theory, implies that the more active elderly people are, {{the more likely they}} are to be satisfied with life. The view that elderly adults should maintain well-being by keeping active has had a considerable history and since 1972, this has come to be known as activity theory. However, this theory <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> inappropriate as disengagement for some people as the current paradigm on the psychology of ageing is that both disengagement theory and activity theory may be optimal for certain people in old age, depending on both circumstances and personality traits of the individual concerned.

25|$|Naultinus are preyed on by {{a number}} of {{invasive}} mammalian species including cats, rodents (3 species of rat and the house mouse) and mustelids. While the larger predators such as stoats and cats are the normal focus of pest control efforts in New Zealand, it is thought that the effect that smaller predators such as mice and weasels <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> great or even worse. After the removal of mice from Mana Island in the '90s, lizard numbers increased massively – demonstrating that mouse predation does serious harm to native reptile populations. Mice can squeeze into much smaller hiding places to take lizards as prey and they also forage year round, no matter how cold it gets - this is significant because below 5 degrees Celsius lizards become torpid and can't defend themselves against attack. This would mean that Naultinus sheltering from cold weather on the ground at the base of plants or underneath debris would be particularly vulnerable to mouse predation. In addition to being preyed on by certain species of invasive mammals, Naultinus are also preyed on by introduced bird species - mynas have been observed plucking Naultinus from the forest canopy in parts of Northland and magpies have been observed searching scrub canopies in a similar fashion at known Naultinus sites in the South Island.|$|E

Nick lies to Dot that he had promised to send money to Sandy {{on the condition that}} she named their daughter Dorothy after her grandmother, so that Dot will trust him and bond with his daughter; Dot does not know Dotty's real name. After spending the night, Dotty begs Dot to let them stay longer. Dot soon discovers that Nick is unemployed and he and Dotty have been living rough. Nick says he will either put Dotty into care or sell her to Dot. After serious consideration, she buys Dotty to get her away from Nick. Dotty learns that Dot has left all her money to Dotty in her will, and tells Nick. They plan to kill Dot to inherit the money, and trick her into thinking she is suffering from dementia. Eventually, Dotty is told by Nick to give Dot an overdose of her medication, but, Dotty has {{had a change of heart}} and gives the pills to Nick in his beer. When Nick learns of Dotty's double-crossing, he drags her to the café and holds everyone inside hostage. [...] Dotty escapes along with most of the others, but the café explodes, and in the commotion, Nick escapes. Dot suspects Dotty <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> evil as Nick, so plants some tablets on the kitchen table whilst Dotty has her back turned. Dot leaves the room and spies on Dotty, who ignores the tablets.|$|E

2500|$|In sea water, ROS can be {{generated}} through abiotic as well as biotic processes, among which are the radiolysis and photolysis of water molecules and cellular respiration. [...] According to a model proposed by Fan for the prediction of ROS in surface waters, the biochemistry mediated by phytoplankton <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> important {{for the production of}} ROS as photochemistry. Biological ROS is often synthesized in mitochondrial membranes, as well as the endoplasmic reticulum of animals, plants, and some bacteria. In addition, chloroplasts and the organelles peroxisomes and glyoxysomes are also sites for the generation of ROS. [...] The ROS most likely released to the environment are those produced at the cell surface as electrons get [...] "leaked" [...] from the respiratory chain and react with molecular oxygen, O2. [...] The products of this subsequent reduction of molecular oxygen are what are referred to as reactive oxygen species. [...] Thus, the production of ROS is in direct proportion to the concentration of O2 in the system, with increases of O2 leading to higher production of ROS. There are three main reactive oxygen species: the superoxide anion (O2−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (OH•). [...] The superoxide anion is formed directly from the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is then formed from the disproportionation of the superoxide anion. [...] This reaction occurs very quickly in seawater. [...] Next, the reduction of hydrogen peroxide yields the hydroxyl radical, H2O2↔2OH•, which can then get reduced to the hydroxyl ion and water. [...] However, the presence of reactive oxygen species in marine systems is hard to detect and measure accurately, for a number of reasons. [...] First, ROS concentrations are generally low (nanomoles) in seawater. [...] Second, they may react with other hard to identify molecules that occur in low quantities, resulting in unknown products. [...] Finally, they are (for the most part) transient intermediates, having lifetimes as little as microseconds.|$|E
