50|$|Upon {{initiative}} of FSE,a European Supporters Charter Handbook was elaborated {{in consultation with}} European football governing bodies such as UEFA and the European Professional Football Leagues (EPFL), national associations and leagues, the world players’ union FIFPro, fans’ representatives from the FSE <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> <b>representatives</b> of {{institutions such as the}} European Commission and the Council of Europe. According to the chair of the Standing Committee on Spectator Violence of the Council of Europe, Jo Vanhecke, the “process to produce this handbook was in itself a breakthrough. All relevant stakeholders have had an input and discussed the content in an open dialogue, based on principles of mutual respect and equal status". The final document was designed as a practical tool kit to serve clubs and fans and was endorsed by the EU Commissioner for Education and Culture, Androulla Vassiliou and UEFA President Michel Platini.|$|E

50|$|As {{the numbers}} of {{co-operative}} schools and partnerships increased, {{the need for a}} national body to provide a voice for the movement was increasingly clear. In 2009, the Schools Co-operative Society (SCS) was established to fulfil that function, with a <b>membership</b> system <b>and</b> <b>representatives</b> on a national board reflecting the regions.Co-operative trusts are, by definition, autonomous however and {{in many areas of the}} country imaginative and successful work has been in evidence to execute successful work in training, procurement and other activities on behalf of the schools in a particular learning community. In turn, some areas which were early adopters of the model - such as Cornwall, where a majority of the schools became part of an education co-operative over a period of time - have formed clusters and networks where this is appropriate to support greater cohesion and capacity. This of course reflects one of the tenets of co-operatives: co-operation between co-operatives.|$|R
40|$|PurposeTo {{determine}} {{diversity in}} the <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> analyze representation of private practitioners and ethnic and racial minorities/women in senior leadership roles in a regional vascular society. MethodsThe program book distributed at the 2008 annual meeting was used to compile information on membership categories, academic status, gender, and ethnic origin of members. Excluded from further analysis were all but active and senior members (n = 386). Officers for President and current President-Elect (P, n = 31), Secretary (S, n = 10), Treasurer (T, n = 11), and Councilor (C, n = 33) over a 30 -year period were scrutinized for similar information. Members {{were considered to be}} “academic” if they worked full time at an academic medical center or as faculty at a teaching hospital with a vascular fellowship and national recognition. Private practice (PP) or academic practice (AP) was determined by personal knowledge, mailing address, e-mail address, and search engines. Ethnic and racial origin was determined by name, personal knowledge, or a web search. ResultsOf the 386 active and senior members in the society, 86 % were white, 13. 7 % were of various ethnic/racial groups, and 5. 7 % were women. Sixty-eight percent of members were in PP. Female members {{were more likely to be}} in AP compared with male members (68. 1 % vs 29. 6 %, P <. 0002). White males made up 89. 4 % of all officers and 94. 2 % of all senior positions over the 30 years of the society. Seventy officer positions were occupied by those in AP (82. 3 %) vs 15 positions (18 %) for the PP group. For the senior positions, 92. 3 % were from the AP group compared with the 8 % from the PP group. (P <. 0036) White male academics (WMAs) (23. 7 % of membership) occupied 86 % of all senior leadership and 57 % of C positions compared with 13 % and 42 %, respectively, for the rest of the membership (P <. 0041). Of the 33 C positions, 66. 6 % were filled by members in AP. Of these 22 AP Councilors, 11 (50 %) then moved up to senior leadership positions compared with two of 11 (18 %) PP councilors (P =. 07). ConclusionsEthnic and racial minorities and women are under represented in the membership compared with the general population, medical school graduates, and faculty. PPs and non-white male academics are under represented in senior leadership positions. With changing demographics, a predicted shortage of vascular surgeons, the need for role models in leadership positions and a push to culturally competent care, regional and national societies must change course and promote a more diverse <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> <b>representative</b> senior leadership...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Better {{information}} about the cost-benefit of abatement has an ambiguous effect on both the equilibrium <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> on aggregate welfare of an international environmental agreement. Previous papers claim that (complete) learning increases <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> decreases aggregate welfare. That claim is based on analysis of approximations to the relations between a damage parameter <b>and</b> <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> welfare. Those approximations have characteristics not shared by the functions {{they are intended to}} approximate, so conclusions based on the approximations are wrong. The correct result is that complete learning increases <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> welfare when the damage parameter is “very likely to be high”, and the reverse holds when the damage parameter is “very likely to be low”. ...|$|R
