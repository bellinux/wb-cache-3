40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a model that studies the impact of a <b>tightening</b> <b>monetary</b> policy on banking failure in a {{developing}} country. The interest rate on treasury bills is included in the model to measure monetary policy.

40|$|This paper uses 13, 766 firm-year {{observations}} between 2003 and 2013 from China {{to investigate}} the effects of monetary policy on corporate investment and the mitigating effects of cash holding. We find that <b>tightening</b> <b>monetary</b> policy reduces corporate investment while cash holdings mitigate such adverse effects. The cash mitigating role is especially significant for financially constrained firms, non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) and those firms located in a less developed financial market. Cash holding also improves investment efficiency when <b>monetary</b> policy is <b>tightening</b> and <b>tightening</b> <b>monetary</b> policy enhances the ‘cash-cash flow’ sensitivity. Our empirical evidence calls for a critical evaluation on the monetary policies implemented in China which are less effective for state-owned enterprises. It also calls for a necessity for local government to further develop regional financial markets to protect vulnerable businesses, such as non-SOEs and financially constrained firms, from external shocks {{in order to maintain}} their sustainable growth and competitive advantages...|$|R
50|$|<b>Monetary</b> <b>tightening</b> in 2007 was {{complicated}} by the strong inflow of foreign exchange. The National Bank of Moldova increased reserve requirements from 10 to 15 percent, and raised policy interest rates by 2.5 percentage points. Nevertheless, the possibility of second-round effects from the drought, liquidity pressures from growing remittances and FDI, and the continued strong growth in credit and broad money suggest that upside risks to inflation are not yet fully contained.|$|E
50|$|Later, BOJ {{hinted at}} the {{possibility}} of tightening the policy due to inflationary pressures within the domestic economy. Despite leaving the official discount rate unchanged during the summer of 1987, the BOJ had expressed concern over excessive monetary easing, particularly after the money supply and asset prices rose sharply. Nonetheless, Black Monday in the US triggered a delay for the BOJ to switch to a <b>monetary</b> <b>tightening</b> policy. The BOJ officially increased the discount rate on March 31, 1989.|$|E
50|$|By August 1990, the Nikkei {{stock index}} had {{plummeted}} to half its peak {{by the time}} of the fifth <b>monetary</b> <b>tightening</b> by the Bank of Japan (BOJ). By late 1991, asset prices began to fall. Even though asset prices had visibly collapsed by early 1992, the economy's decline continued for more than a decade. This decline resulted in a huge accumulation of non-performing assets loans (NPL), causing difficulties for many financial institutions. The bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble contributed to what many call the Lost Decade.|$|E

50|$|The social {{consequences}} of such economic plan, the PAEG, were negative. Though inflation had been reduced, it was still high for international standards. And {{in combination with the}} wage-freezing policies, it caused Brazilians' real income to fall sharply—by about 25%—from 1963 to 1967. As a consequence, malnutrition and infant mortality rose. The Brazilian industrial elite, too, began to turn on the government; not only it had been hurt by the sudden market opening, but also the <b>monetary</b> <b>tightening</b> applied under the PAEG had dried out credit and induced a recession in output.|$|E
50|$|When Vice President Richard M.

In his book Six Crises, Nixon later blamed his defeat in 1960 in part on Fed policy and the resulting tight credit conditions and slow growth.

50|$|The U.S. Federal Reserve’s <b>monetary</b> <b>tightening</b> in 1988 {{targeted}} the rapid inflation of the 1980s.

The August 6 invasion {{was seen as a}} direct threat to the price stability the Fed sought. In fact, the Council of Economic Advisors published a consensus estimate that a one-year, 50 percent increase in the price of oil could temporarily raise the price level of the economy by 1 percent and potentially lower real output by the same amount.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper studies how U. S. {{monetary}} policy affects global stock prices. We find that global stock prices respond strongly {{to changes in}} U.

50|$|In 1976, Robert Lucas of the Chicago {{school of}} {{economics}} introduced the Lucas critique, which called into question the logic behind Keynesian macroeconomic policy making. The new classical economics became the dominant school in macroeconomics. By the mid-1970s, policy makers were beginning to lose their confidence in the effectiveness of government intervention in the economy. In 1976 British Prime Minister James Callaghan said that the option of “spending {{our way out of}} recession” no longer exists.In 1979, the election of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister brought monetarism to British economic policy. In the US, the Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker adopted similar policies of <b>monetary</b> <b>tightening</b> in order to control inflation.|$|E

The possibility of assistance to the Central Bank of Azerbaijan was also discussed. An agreement was reached to hold Article IV consultations in November 2017. Azerbaijan was included in a 2017 IMF outlook report for the Middle East where the IMF believes economic conditions are gradually improving, {{in part due to}} a preferable environment emerging in the global community. Despite this, progress will be hampered due to a need for these countries to enact some structural reforms and re-evaluating their positions on fiscal matters.|$|E

He blamed the government's [...] "commercial loan theory" [...] of banking for <b>monetary</b> <b>tightening</b> in mid-1929, when the economy was already declining, and then for its passivity during {{the next four years}} in the face of mass liquidations and bank failures. Instead, he advocated control of the money supply to stabilize income and expenditures. In a January, 1932 Harvard memorandum on antidepression policy, Currie and fellow instructors Harry Dexter White and Paul T. Ellsworth urged large fiscal deficits coupled with open market operations to expand bank reserves, as well as the lifting of tariffs and the relief of interallied debts.|$|E

40|$|The {{study used}} a {{structural}} vector autoregressive approach to estimate and quantify the percentage decline in consumption expenditure, {{which can be}} attributed to changes in housing wealth, after <b>monetary</b> policy <b>tightening.</b> The effects are separated using a disaggregated Absa house price data, namely all-size, large-size and medium-size and small-size house prices. The results suggest that {{at the peak of the}} interest rate effects on consumption the combined effect of housing wealth and credit extension changes, following a <b>monetary</b> policy <b>tightening,</b> was a decline of 9. 8 per cent in all-size, 3. 7 per cent in small-size, 4. 7 per cent in medium-size and 5. 3 per cent in large-size houses. The findings indicate heterogeneity in the transmission of interest rate effects operating through housing wealth and the credit channel. Moreover, we reached the same conclusion after modifying the baseline model by adding the restrictions that house price also respond to both aggregate demand and aggregate supply variables. Lastly, the differences between the counterfactual consumption and the baseline consumption responses, provided little support for the assumption that the housing wealth channel is the dominant source of monetary policy transmission to consumption. This paper thus provided an understanding of the indirect channels through which monetary policy influences real variables by focusing on monetary policy transmission to consumption via house prices. We showed interest rate effects, working through both housing wealth and the credit channel, influence real spending. Thus, interest rate effects operating through housing wealth and the credit channel are felt differently by the four house categories. Moreover, the differences between the consumption impulse responses from the counterfactual and baseline scenarios provide little support that combined house wealth and credit effect channels are the dominant sources of monetary policy transmission to consumption. These findings suggest that the direct effects of high interest rates on consumption appear to be more important in transmitting monetary policy to the economy than through the indirect effects. Hence, <b>monetary</b> policy <b>tightening</b> can only marginally weaken inflationary pressures arising from excessive consumption operating through housing wealth and the credit channel. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of trade credit in the {{transmission}} of monetary policy. Most models of the transmission mechanism allow the firm to access only financial markets or bank lending according to some net worth criterion. In our model we introduce trade credit as an additional source of funding. We predict that when <b>monetary</b> policy <b>tightens</b> {{there will be a}} reduction in market and bank lending, and an increase in trade credit. This is confirmed with an empirical investigation of 16, 000 manufacturing firms. ...|$|R
40|$|Following a <b>monetary</b> <b>tightening,</b> {{bank loans}} to {{consumers}} decrease.

In contrast, business loans increase following a <b>monetary</b> <b>tightening.</b> The `perverse' response of business loans cannot be explained by an increase in the demand for funds due to a reduction in real activity. These results are consistent with a change in bank portfolio behaviour in favour of business loans in response to a <b>monetary</b> <b>tightening.</b> ...|$|E
