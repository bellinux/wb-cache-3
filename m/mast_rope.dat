50|$|A Partnership Deal {{was signed}} for the yard in 1853, {{with the firm}} now {{including}} Robert senior and junior, as well as Thompson’s two other sons, Joseph and John. Joseph, however, quickly found himself in charge following the retirement of Robert senior and junior, as well as John, between then and 1860. Already experienced in designing vessels, he devoted his energies to furthering the business, being joined by his own sons, Robert and Joseph, within a few years. The year 1870 was a particular highlight, as it saw the last wooden ship built at North Sands. It was named Peace to commemorate {{the end of the}} Franco-Prussian War. Iron ships were, by now, far more popular and the crafts which had flourished in the days of sail - <b>mast,</b> <b>rope</b> and sail making - were all affected by the steamer age. Thompsons underwent a major overhaul to prepare for metal vessels and in 1871, just after the finishing touches were made, its name was changed to Joseph L Thompson.|$|E

60|$|It was wanton slaughter, and all for woman’s sake. No man ate of {{the seal}} meat or the oil. After a good day’s killing I have seen our decks covered with hides and bodies, {{slippery}} with fat and blood, the scuppers running red; <b>masts,</b> <b>ropes,</b> and rails spattered with the sanguinary colour; and the men, like butchers plying their trade, naked and red of arm and hand, {{hard at work}} with ripping and flensing-knives, removing the skins from the pretty sea-creatures they had killed.|$|R

2500|$|The pirate's {{characteristic}} loot included various ships' cargo like slaves or tobacco. There {{were also}} very unconventional trophies, {{such as the}} wig of a captured captain that the famed pirate Walter Kennedy once took as booty. The most sought after prize that pirates wanted to capture was, unquestionably, a ship, an ocean vessel that pirates could convert to suit their own needs. Pirates would scrape a captured ship for guns, <b>masts,</b> <b>rope,</b> and other supplies that could repair or improve their current vessel. Whereas capturing a ship that was more equipped and more powerful than their current craft was the ultimate prize, the issue was that [...] "the pirate could only capture a prize which his vessel could catch." [...] A faster, larger ship with quality weaponry indicated that the pirate could capture other treasures more easily.|$|R
50|$|Built in 1817, the Mary Russell was a {{small wooden}} brig of 132 tonnes, drawing 13 feet under load, single-decked with beams. That tonnage would make it about 80 feet in length.

2500|$|A boom, in {{the context}} of windsurfing, is a piece of {{equipment}} that attaches to the mast, providing structural support for the sail. It completely encircles the sail, and is designed to be gripped, allowing the sailor to control the sail for normal sailing, and also for almost any type of maneuver (such as gybing, tacking, and waterstarting). Early booms (often called a [...] "wishbone boom" [...] due to their symmetrical shape) were tied on to the <b>mast</b> using <b>rope,</b> but newer booms use a clamp mechanism for attachment.|$|R

5000|$|After France and Spain became {{involved}} in the War of the American Revolution in 1778 Dutch merchants also were heavily involved in trade with these belligerents in goods that the British considered contraband, but that fell outside the narrow definition of that concept in the Anglo-Dutch Commercial Treaty of 1668. This treaty guaranteed Dutch shipping a privileged status and exempted it from trade embargoes enforced by the British Royal Navy as far as non-contraband goods were concerned. A diplomatic conflict between Great Britain now ensued about the interpretation of this treaty and of the definition of [...] "contraband" [...] under it. The British tried to declare naval stores, like ship's timbers, spars, <b>masts,</b> <b>rope,</b> tar and pitch [...] "contraband," [...] against which the Dutch maintained the narrow definition of the treaty as only [...] "arms and munitions." [...] The trade in naval stores was important to France, as her naval construction depended on it. France therefore strongly opposed the tendency of the pro-British Dutch government of stadtholder William V to give in to the British demands and insisted on the Dutch [...] "defending their treaty rights" [...] to the point of selectively using economic sanctions against Dutch cities that supported the stadtholder's policy on this point. In November, 1779, the States-General of the Netherlands therefore directed the stadtholder (as commander-in-chief of the Dutch navy) to offer limited convoy to Dutch merchants. This was a compromise, as it still excluded protection of merchantmen transporting naval stores to belligerents, but it was hoped that other, even more innocent Dutch vessels could be protected from the harassment of the Royal Navy and British privateers in this way.|$|R

I am sure some of us, and myself first among the number, regretted Goguelat. Some were persuaded it was safe, and could prove the same by argument; but if they had good reasons why some one else should make the trial, they had better still why it should not be themselves. Others, again, condemned the whole idea as insane; among these, as ill-luck would have it, a seaman of the fleet; who was the most dispiriting of all. The height, he reminded us, was greater than the tallest ship's <b>mast,</b> the <b>rope</b> entirely free; and he as good as defied the boldest and strongest to succeed.

60|$|Sect. 43. An acre of land, {{that bears}} here twenty bushels of wheat, {{and another in}} America, which, with the same husbandry, would do the like, are, without doubt, of the same natural {{intrinsic}} value: but yet the benefit mankind receives from the one in a year, is worth 5l. and from the other possibly not worth a penny, if all the profit an Indian received from it were to be valued, and sold here; at least, I may truly say, not one thousandth. It is labour then which puts the greatest part of value upon land, without which it would scarcely be worth any thing: it is to that we owe the greatest part of all its useful products; for all that the straw, bran, bread, of that acre of wheat, is more worth than {{the product of an}} acre of as good land, which lies waste, is all the effect of labour: for it is not barely the plough-man's pains, the reaper's and thresher's toil, and the baker's sweat, is to be counted into the bread we eat; the labour of those who broke the oxen, who digged and wrought the iron and stones, who felled and framed the timber employed about the plough, mill, oven, or any other utensils, which are a vast number, requisite to this corn, from its being feed to be sown to its being made bread, must all be charged on the account of labour, and received as an effect of that: nature and the earth furnished only the almost worthless materials, as in themselves. It would be a strange catalogue of things, that industry provided and made use of, about every loaf of bread, before it came to our use, if we could trace them; iron, wood, leather, bark, timber, stone, bricks, coals, lime, cloth, dying drugs, pitch, tar, <b>masts,</b> <b>ropes,</b> and all the materials made use of in the ship, that brought any of the commodities made use of by any of the workmen, to any part of the work; all which it would be almost impossible, at least too long, to reckon up.|$|R

The Greek government used Zappas' money to complete the Gymnasterion, a central gym, in 1878, and to continue the work on the Zappeion exhibition center, which had begun in 1873 and was frequently interrupted. The Zappeion officially opened on October 20, 1888. As in 1875, Fokianos took charge of the sporting events (but did so independently of the earlier Olympic Committee), which were postponed up till April 30, 1889. These Games were not co-ordinated by the Olympic Committee that organised the 1859, 1870, and 1875 Zappas Games, but by Fokianos alone. Thirty athletes competed in a variety of disciplines including discus, pole long leap (over a ditch), weightlifting, <b>mast</b> climbing, and <b>rope</b> climbing among others. All participants were clad alike.|$|R

Here Ulysses would have been drowned, but he caught {{at the root of}} a fig tree that grew on the rock, and there he hung, clinging with his toes to the crumbling stones till the whirlpool boiled up again, and up came the timbers.

40|$|Seismic {{design of}} guyed masts, {{commonly}} used in the broadcasting and telecommunications industries, has not been fully addressed in the United States. There is no specific design code, and only {{a limited amount of}} research has been reported on the subject. This research investigates the behavior of guyed <b>masts</b> incorporating synthetic <b>ropes</b> as guys, with a particular focus on the effect of snap loads on the mast behavior. This is the third phase of a multi-stage project aimed at analyzing the potential for Snapping-Cable Energy Dissipators (SCEDs) to minimize lateral response in structures. A finite element model of a 120 -m-tall guyed mast was developed with the commercial program ABAQUS. The three-dimensional behavior of the mast was observed when subjected to two ground motion records: Northridge and El Centro. Three orthogonal earthquake components were input, two horizontal and one vertical. A series of parametric studies was conducted to determine the sensitivity of the response to guy pretension, which {{is a measure of the}} potential slackness in the guys during response. Additionally, the studies examined the effects of guy stiffness, mast properties, and directionality of input motion...|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} place, {{every bit of}} it was glass, and that was a great wonder of itself; because the <b>masts,</b> yards, and <b>ropes</b> were made to {{resemble}} exactly the corresponding parts of a real vessel that could go to sea. She carried two tiers of black guns all along her two decks; and often I used to try to peep in at the portholes, to see what else was inside; but the holes were so small, and it looked so very dark indoors, that I could discover little or nothing; though, when I was very little, I made no doubt, that if I could but once pry open the hull, and break the glass all to pieces, I would infallibly light upon something wonderful, perhaps some gold guineas, of which I have always been in want, ever since I could remember. And often I used to feel a sort of insane desire to be the death of the glass ship, case, and all, in order to come at the plunder; and one day, throwing out some hint of the kind to my sisters, they ran to my mother in a great clamor; and after that, the ship was placed on the mantel-piece for a time, beyond my reach, and until I should recover my reason.|$|R

2500|$|While yet a young man, Nicholas {{followed}} {{the example of}} his uncle, the abbot, by making a pilgrimage to the birthplace of Christianity—the Holy Land.

When he awoke {{in the morning he}} warned the sailors that a severe storm was coming, but they need not fear, for [...] "God will protect us." [...] Almost immediately the sky darkened and strong winds roared round the ship. The wind and waves made it impossible to keep the ship under control. Even with lowered sails, the sailors feared for their very lives and begged Nicholas to pray for safety. One sailor climbed the main <b>mast,</b> tightening the <b>ropes</b> so the <b>mast</b> would not crash onto the deck.

5000|$|The Dutch Republic had, after {{a period}} of strife {{during the second half of}} the seventeenth century, become a steadfast ally of the Kingdom of Great Britain, {{initially}} (after the Glorious Revolution of 1688) as the senior partner in the alliance, but later in the eighteenth century as the increasingly junior partner. It was bound to Britain by a number of treaties of military alliance (notably those of 1678, 1689 and 1716) which arguably obliged it to offer armed support. On the other hand, it had obtained in the Treaty of Breda and its offshoot, the Commercial Treaty of 1668 (confirmed in the Treaty of Westminster) an important concession from England: the right to transport non-contraband goods in its ships to countries with which Britain was at war, without these goods being subject to seizure by Britain even if they were owned by subjects of belligerent powers (this was usually referred to as the principle of [...] "free ship, free goods"). The concept [...] "contraband" [...] was narrowly defined in these treaties as [...] "arms and munitions." [...] So-called [...] "naval stores" [...] (by which were commonly understood: ship's timbers, <b>masts</b> and spars, <b>rope,</b> canvas, tar and pitch) were not to be considered contraband. [...] This right became important during wars in which Britain was a participant, but the Republic remained neutral, like the Seven Years' War and after 1778 the American Revolutionary War, in which Britain opposed the rebelling American Colonies and their allies, France and Spain. Arguably it exempted Dutch bottoms from inspection by the Royal Navy (or at least from confiscation of the goods in British prize courts), thereby undermining Britain's ability to maintain an effective embargo on the trade of her enemies, especially because Dutch shipping at the time still played a major role in the European carrying trade.|$|R
60|$|The fishers {{had brought}} with them the mast of a boat, and as {{half of the country}} fellows about had now appeared, either out of zeal or curiosity, it was soon sunk in the ground, and {{sufficiently}} secured. A yard across the upright <b>mast,</b> and a <b>rope</b> stretched along it, and reeved through a block at each end, formed an extempore crane, which afforded the means of lowering an arm-chair, well secured and fastened, down to the flat shelf on which the sufferers had roosted. Their joy at hearing the preparations going on for their deliverance was considerably qualified when they beheld the precarious vehicle by means of which they were to be conveyed to upper air. It swung about a yard free of the spot which they occupied, obeying each impulse of the tempest, the empty air all around it, and depending upon the security of a rope, which, in the increasing darkness, had dwindled to an almost imperceptible thread. Besides the hazard of committing a human being to the vacant atmosphere in such a slight means of conveyance, there was the fearful danger of the chair and its occupant being dashed, either by the wind or the vibrations of the cord, against the rugged face of the precipice. But to diminish the risk as much as possible, the experienced seaman had let down with the chair another line, which, being attached to it, and held by the persons beneath, might serve by way of gy, as Mucklebackit expressed it, to render its descent in some measure steady and regular. Still, to commit one's self in such a vehicle, through a howling tempest of wind and rain, with a beetling precipice above and a raging abyss below, required that courage which despair alone can inspire. Yet, wild as the sounds and sights of danger were, both above, beneath, and around, and doubtful and dangerous as the mode of escaping appeared to be, Lovel and the old mendicant agreed, after a moment's consultation, and after the former, by a sudden strong pull, had, at his own imminent risk, ascertained the security of the rope, that {{it would be best to}} secure Miss Wardour in the chair, and trust to the tenderness and care of those above for her being safely craned up to the top of the crag.|$|R
