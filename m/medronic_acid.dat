40|$|OBJECTIVES: Conventional imaging {{methods are}} {{excellent}} for the morphological {{characterization of the}} consequences of osteonecrosis; however, only specialized techniques have been considered useful for obtaining functional information. To explore the affinity of radiotracers for severely devascularized bone, a new mouse model of isolated femur implanted in a subcutaneous abdominal pocket was devised. To maintain animal mobility and longevity, the femur was harvested from syngeneic donors. Two technetium- 99 m-labeled tracers targeting angiogenesis and bone matrix were selected. METHODS: <b>Medronic</b> <b>acid</b> and a homodimer peptide conjugated with RGDfK were radiolabeled with technetium- 99 m, and biodistribution was evaluated in Swiss mice. The grafted and control femurs were evaluated after 15, 30 and 60 days, including computed tomography (CT) and histological analysis. RESULTS: Radiolabeling achieved high (> 95 %) radiochemical purity. The biodistribution confirmed good blood clearance 1 hour after administration. For 99 mTc-hydrazinonicotinic acid (HYNIC) -E-[c(RGDfK) 2, remarkable renal excretion was observed compared to 99 mTc-methylene diphosphonate (MDP), but the latter, as expected, revealed higher bone uptake. The results obtained in the control femur were equal at all time points. In the implanted femur, 99 mTc-HYNIC-E-[c(RGDfK) 2 uptake was highest after 15 days, consistent with early angiogenesis. Regarding 99 mTc-MDP in the implant, similar uptake was documented at all time points, consistent with sustained bone viability; however, the uptake was lower than that detected in the control femur, as confirmed by histology. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Graft viability was successfully diagnosed using radiotracers in severely ischemic bone at all time points. 2) Analogously, indirect information about angiogenesis could be gathered using 999 mTc-HYNIC-E-[c(RGDfK) 2. 3) These techniques appear promising and warrant further studies to determine their potential clinical applications...|$|E
