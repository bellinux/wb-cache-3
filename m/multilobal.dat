40|$|<b>Multilobal</b> fibres are irregularly shaped fibres {{with several}} surface {{channels}} or grooves. Scaffolds created from these fibres have high surface area which may enhance cell density. This study compared the cell growth of dermal fibroblasts and osteoblast-like SaOS 2 cells on <b>multilobal</b> fibre nonwoven scaffolds {{to the conventional}} fibre scaffolds. Cells were cultured on round nylon, trilobal nylon, round polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and <b>multilobal</b> PET scaffolds for 14 days. There were more cells growing on trilobal nylon and PET <b>multilobal</b> scaffolds than their round counterparts. The preference {{to the type of}} <b>multilobal</b> scaffolds was cell dependent. The density of fibroblast increased 37 % on trilobal nylon compared to round nylon scaffolds after 14 days of culture. SaOS 2 cells preferred the <b>multilobal</b> PET scaffolds, exhibiting a 66 % increase in cell number after 14 days of culture. Scaffolds manufactured from <b>multilobal</b> fibres have the ability to accommodate a high number of cells, demonstrating a great potential in tissue engineering applications...|$|E
40|$|<b>Multilobal</b> fibres contain several grooves {{and have}} higher surface area than round fibres. Cell density can be {{enhanced}} when cultured on scaffolds manufactured with <b>multilobal</b> fibres. This study compared the cell growth of dermal fibroblasts and osteoblast-like SaOS 2 cells on polymeric scaffolds produced from <b>multilobal</b> fibres to the conventional round-fibred scaffolds. Cells were cultured on round nylon 6, 6, trilobal nylon 6, 6, round polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and <b>multilobal</b> PET scaffolds for 14 days. There were more cells cultured on trilobal nylon 6, 6 and PET <b>multilobal</b> scaffolds than their round counterparts. Preference {{to the type of}} <b>multilobal</b> scaffolds was cell dependent. Fibroblasts increased by 21. 8  ±  1. 9 fold to 6. 3  ×  105 cells (p <  0. 001) when cultured on trilobal nylon 6, 6 scaffolds while SaOS 2 cells exhibited a 16. 7  ±  2. 8 fold increase (2. 9  ×  105 cells, p <  0. 001) on the <b>multilobal</b> PET scaffolds after 14 days of culture. The ability of <b>multilobal</b> fibres to accommodate large quantities of cells presents an excellent alternative to round fibres as scaffolds for tissue engineering. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Polyacrylonitrile fiber {{is often}} {{difficult}} to wet due to its low surface energy, advanced crystallinity and orientation. The inherent poor absorbency, accompanied by the high build-up of static charges limits its further development. Many methods have been used to improve the poor anti-static property of polymer materials, including the addition of surfactants, blending and copolymerization of hydrophilic monomers, physical modification and chemical oxidation reaction [1 – 4]. For example, physical modification can change the geometry of the fibers from a round shape to other shapes because <b>multilobal</b> cross sections improve the fiber wicking quality. Protein additives can be used for mod-ification of polyacrylonitrile fibers. Hydrophilic and anti-static properties of polymer materials can be improved by grafting hydrophilic monomers into the polymer matrix [5...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a probabilistic model of ul-trasonic range sensors using backpropagation neural networks trained on experimental data. The sensor model provides {{the probability of}} detecting mapped obstacles in the environment, given their position and orientation relative to the transducer. The detection probability {{can be used to}} compute the location of an autonomous vehicle from those obstacles that {{are more likely to be}} detected. The neural network model is more accurate than other existing approaches, since it captures the typical <b>multilobal</b> detection pattern of ultrasonic transducers. Since the network size is kept small, implementation of the model on a mobile robot can be efficient for real-time navigation. An example that demonstrates how the credence could be incorporated into the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the numerical values of the final neural network weights are provided in the Appendixes. Index Terms—Kalman filtering, mobile robots, motion plan-ning, neural networks, sonar navigation. I...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{demonstrated}} that primo vessels (PVs) were distributed {{in different parts}} of the body in mammals, and PVs were also involved in some processes of pathology such as cancer. Whether PVs are intrinsic structures in mammals or not is still ignored. In this study, a peritonitis model rat was induced by i. p. administration of E. coli in rats. PVs were observed in all infected rats, but it appeared less in untreated rats, taking 10. 53 % (4 / 38). In addition, we examined cell types in celiac PVs by fluorescent staining with 4 ′, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) and Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin, as well as immunofluorescent staining with CD 11 b and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), and found the following. (1) The rod-shaped nuclei aligned longitudinally along PVs. (2) DAPI-, phalloidin-, CD 11 b-, and ICAM- 1 -positive labeling coexisted in PVs, suggesting that fibroblasts and leucocytes might be two kinds of cell types in PVs for both infected and control rats. (3) The difference was that numerous cells in PVs of the infected rats contained DAPI-labeled <b>multilobal</b> nucleus and were expressed with CD 11 b- and ICAM- 1 -positive labeling on the cytoplasm and membrane, showing the typical characteristics of neutrophil. (4) The cells in PVs from the untreated rats are those of loose connective tissue. Therefore, it is reasonably considered that PVs from infected rats might be the pathological products which might be involved in inflammation...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of fabricating polypropylene (PP) nanofibers has been explored by using different additives, such as sodium oleate (SO), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS), during melt electrospinning. PP of high melt flow index (1000) was used with PEG and PDMS for {{the reduction of}} the melt viscosity; and it was used with SO for improving the electrical conductivity during melt electrospinning. It was observed that all the additives used in this study helped to reduce the fiber diameter. The most promising additive, SO, was effective in reducing the fiber diameter to the nanometer scale due to the increase in the electrical conductivity. The fiber diameter was decreased by the addition of PEG and PDMS due to the decrease in the melt viscosity. The effect of die shape on the fiber cross-sectional shape was analyzed and an interesting finding is that the die shapes did not {{have an effect on the}} cross-sectional shape of the fibers. That is, irrespective of the die shapes (i. e. trilobal, tetralobal, <b>multilobal</b> and circular) used in this study, the crosssectional shapes of melt electrospun fibers were circular. The distribution of the additives in the fiber was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and was found to be uniform. Tensile tests were performed on single nanofibers with limited success, due to the problems in preparing fiber samples and successfully holding them in the jaws of the testing machine without slippage...|$|E
40|$|We present high spatial {{resolution}} {{observations of the}} dusty core of the Planetary Nebula with Wolf-Rayet central star CPD- 56 ◦ 8032, for which indications of a compact disk have been found by HST/SITS observations. These observations were taken with the mid-infrared interferometer VLTI/MIDI in imaging mode providing a typical 300 mas resolution and in interferometric mode using UT 2 -UT 3 47 m baseline providing a typical {{spatial resolution}} of 20 mas. We also made use of unpublished HST/ACS images in the F 435 W and F 606 W filters. The visible HST images exhibit a complex <b>multilobal</b> geometry dominated by faint lobes. The farthest structures are located at 7 ′′ from the star. The mid-IR environment of CPD- 56 ◦ 8032 is dominated by a compact source, barely resolved by a single UT telescope in a 8. 7 µm filter (∆λ= 1. 6 µm, contaminated by PAH emission). The infrared core is almost fully resolved with the three 40 - 45 m projected baselines ranging from- 5 ◦ to 51 ◦ but smooth oscillating fringes at low level have been detected in spectrally dispersed visibilities. This clear signal is interpreted {{in terms of a}} ring structure which would define the bright inner rim of the equatorial disk. Geometric models allowed us to derive the main geometrical parameters of the disk.

Furthermore, we performed some radiative transfer modeling aimed at further constraining the geometry and mass content of the disk, by taking into account the MIDI dispersed visibilities, spectra, and the large aperture SED of the source.
