40|$|Corruption can impede {{commerce}} and economic development, yet {{it seems to}} be tolerated in many countries. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop and test a model that integrates socioeconomic factors related to corruption. The analysis re-vealed that a negative relationship between economic adversity and wealth was mediated by corruption. Economic adversity was positively related to corruption, and corruption was inversely related to wealth. Uncertainty avoidance moderated the relationship between economic adversity and corruption, whereas power dis-tance and uncertainty avoidance were positively associated with corruption. The implications of these results for enhancing the effectiveness of international agree-ments are discussed. The growth in international trade over the past few decades has raised con-cerns about differing business practices that can impede {{commerce and}} economic development. One such concern revolves around bribery and corruption. Bribery and corruption are thought by many to be an unavoid-able part of international business. Businesspersons from the industrial-ized countries of the West assert that it is impossible to do business in cer-tain parts of the world without paying bribes. Time and again, people seeking to find excuses for paying bribes attribute their actions to local foreign cultures. Although accepting bribes is illegal in virtually all coun-tries and paying bribes is objectionable in virtually all cultures, it is true that business-related bribery seems to be tolerated in some countries more than in others. In a recent speech, then-U. S. trade representative <b>Mickey</b> <b>Kantor</b> (1996) noted that “corruption has existed as long as there have been peopl...|$|E
