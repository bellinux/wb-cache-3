40|$|The {{mechanical}} and acoustic anisotropy of media is a governing {{factor in the}} behaviour of <b>multilayered</b> <b>systems</b> including such media. The understanding of the mechanisms conditioning the dynamic behaviour of <b>multilayered</b> <b>systems</b> is of paramount importance. In particular, the intrinsic anisotropy of poroelastic media presents a potential for the optimal design of systems for multifunctional performances. Indeed, these <b>multilayered</b> <b>systems</b> are bound by stiffness, thermal and acoustic performance constraints in simultaneously. A plane wave method is presented to study the influence of material orientation in the dynamic behaviour of <b>multilayered</b> <b>systems</b> composed of anisotropic poroelastic media. The method is applied to a system composed of an anisotropic open-celled melamine foam core in between two metal sheets. This particular multilayered configuration allows {{to shed light on}} phenomena intrinsic to layers composed of anisotropic poroelastic materials, such as the frequency shift of the fundamental resonance of the panel, or the compression-shear coupling effects taking place in the poroelastic core layers. The latter phenomena is of particular importance, as it is evidenced on the unconventional polarisation of waves in anisotropic poroelastic media. Finally, the method is adapted to the optimisation of <b>multilayered</b> <b>systems</b> for acoustic performance. the design variables are consequently the core material orientations with respect to the global coordinate system. The solutions to the optimisation problem are analysed in terms of dynamic behaviour, thus allowing to correlate acoustic performance of the overall structure, and the response of each individual layer.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a numerical {{analysis for the}} determination of the equivalent thickness of a homogeneous base layer of an unreinforced <b>multilayered</b> <b>system</b> subjected to the repetitive loadings of a constant value. The system demonstrates the same performance as the analogous <b>multilayered</b> <b>system</b> does which contains the geogrid inclusion as reinforcement in the placement of interest of the base layer. The constitutive model adopted in the analysis is the modification of the small displacement theory of elastic continuum. Employing the proposed constitutive model the permanent modulus in each homogeneous isotropic layer of the unreinforced <b>multilayered</b> <b>systems</b> is determined for each sequent loading. It is done by the implementation of the Finite Element Method with respect to spatial variables. The same approach is used in analysis of reinforced <b>multilayered</b> <b>systems</b> in which geogrid is placed.

It has been shown that there is an abrupt transition between these two regimes.|$|E
