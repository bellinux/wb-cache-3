40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} the nexus between the excess of liquidity in the United States and commodity prices over the 1983 - 2006 period. In particular, it assesses whether commodity prices react more powerfully than consumer goods'prices to changes in real money balances. Within a cointegrated vector autoregressive framework, the author investigates whether consumer prices and commodity prices react to excess liquidity, and if the different price elasticities of supply for goods and commodities allow for differences in the dynamic paths of price adjustment to a liquidity shock. The results show {{a positive relationship between}} real money and real commodity prices and provide empirical evidence for a stronger response of commodity prices with respect to consumer goods'prices. This could imply that, if the magnitude of the reaction is due the fact that consumer goods'prices are slower to react, then their long-run value can be predicted with the help of commodity prices.

40|$|Economics Research Paper, no. 02 - 15 This paper utilises an {{approach}} to long run modelling proposed by Pesaran, Shin and Smith (2001) to develop empirically weighted broad monetary aggregates for the Euro area. Two alternative aggregates are derived based upon the long run relationship between the M 3 component assets and nominal income or prices respectively. The empirical results {{do not support the}} use of M 3 as the key <b>monetary</b> <b>indicator,</b> as both aggregates accord a very low, or zero weight, to the broadest of the M 3 component assets. The implied optimal weights are very different from those that would be implied by either simple sum or Divisia aggregation. Furthermore, recursive estimation reveals that the optimal weights do evolve over time in response to financial innovation and changes in wealth holder preferences. This implies that an aggregate such as M 3, with fixed and equal weights of unity on all component assets, may not be a reliable leading indicator for inflation. Out of sample forecasts confirmed that the optimally weighted monetary aggregates have superior predictive content for inflation at longer forecast horizons such as 12 quarters...|$|E

40|$|Scientific {{information}} on the size {{and nature of the}} threat of climate change is needed by politicians in order to weight their decisions. Computerised models are extremely useful tools to quantify the long-term effects of current policies. This paper describes a new modelling approach that allows formulation of industrial energy demand projections consistent with the assumptions for scenario drivers such as GDP and population. In the model, a level of industrial production is used as a key variable, and we define it in physical units, rather than in monetary units. The aim of this research is to increase insights that come with long-term energy demand scenarios. This research clearly shows that physical indicators provide additional insights in scenario analysis. The use of physical <b>indicators</b> instead of <b>monetary</b> <b>indicators</b> seems to affect the energy scenarios significantly. The differences with <b>monetary</b> <b>indicators</b> are larger in developing regions than in OECD regions. We conclude that an integrated energy and materials approach reveals developments that are hardly visible using a monetary approach.

40|$|The natural {{interest}} rate is of great relevance to central banks, {{but it is difficult}} to measure. We show that in a standard microfounded monetary model, the natural {{interest rate}} co-moves with a transformation of the money demand that can be computed from actual data. The co-movement is of a considerable magnitude and independent of monetary policy. An optimizing central bank that does not observe the {{natural interest rate}} can take advantage of this co-movement by incorporating the transformed money demand, in addition to the observed output gap and inflation, into a simple but optimal interest rate rule. Combining the transformed money demand and the observed output gap provides the best information about the natural interest rate.

40|$|The Sustainable Value {{approach}} integrates {{the efficiency}} {{with regard to}} environmental, social and economic resources into a <b>monetary</b> <b>indicator.</b> It gained significant popularity as evidenced by diverse applications at the corporate level. However, its introduction as a measure adhering to the strong sustainability paradigm sparked an ardent debate. This study explores its validity as a macroeconomic strong sustainability measure by applying the Sustainable Value approach to the EU- 15 countries. Concretely, we assessed environmental, social and economic resources {{in combination with the}} GDP for all EU- 15 countries from 1995 to 2006 for three benchmark alternatives. The results show that several countries manage to adequately delink resource use from GDP growth. Furthermore, the remarkable difference in outcome between the national and EU- 15 benchmark indicates a possible inefficiency of the current allocation of national resource ceilings imposed by the European institutions. Additionally, by using an effects model we argue that the service degree of the economy and governmental expenditures on social protection and research and development are important determinants of overall resource efficiency. Finally, we sketch out three necessary conditions to link the Sustainable Value approach to the strong sustainability paradigm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The current {{financial}} crisis has revived the interest for monitoring both monetary and credit developments. Over {{the past two}} decades, consistent with the adoption of inflation targeting strategies by {{a growing number of}} central banks and the development of New Keynesian models for which monetary aggregates are largely irrelevant, money and credit have been progressively neglected in the conduct of monetary policy. A striking exception has been the Eurosystem, which has implemented a strategy known as the "two-pillar monetary policy strategy" giving a prominent role for money. In this paper, we develop a small optimizing model based on Ireland (2004), estimated on euro area data and featuring this two-pillar strategy. We evaluate an ECB-style cross-checking policy rule in a DSGE model with real balance effects of money. We find some evidence that indeed money plays a non-trivial role in explaining the euro area business cycle. This provides a rationale for the central bank to factor in monetary developments but also raises some issues regarding the reliability of M 3 as an appropriate <b>monetary</b> <b>indicator.</b> We find some evidence that the ECB has systematically reacted to a filtered measure of money growth but weak evidence it has reacted more aggressively during excess money growth periods.

40|$|The {{quantity}} and quality of available information {{is one of the major}} constraints for the calculation of the ecological footprint, particularly for sub-national or sub-regional territorial levels. At the national or even regional level, the information that allows for computing the ecological footprint is generally available. However, when trying to calculate the footprint for lower-level territorial realities (e. g., cities or municipalities), this information is insufficient or non-existent. In this article, we propose an indirect method for calculating the ecological footprint of such territorial spaces through Principal Component Analysis. The case study utilises the ecological footprint of Andalusia (a Spanish region) as a starting point for footprint assignment to each of the 771 municipalities included in the Andalusian region. A set of variables related to the consumption levels in these municipalities has been utilised and is expressed in physical units. These variables make it possible to obtain a weighting factor to determine the ecological footprint of each municipality. This procedure also makes it possible to identify which variables or indicators have the greatest impact on the ecological footprint for a given territory. According to the results, the method also shows how inappropriate it is to consider the population as a way to distribute the ecological footprint; there are relevant differences between the weight of the population in municipalities and their generated footprint. There are also significant differences between the magnitude of economic indicators, such as GDP, and the estimated ecological footprint; for municipalities with higher income levels, the ecological impact is more than proportional to the weight of the <b>monetary</b> <b>indicator...</b>|$|E
40|$|The No to {{the euro}} in referendums in Denmark and Sweden has been {{characterized}} as a public rebellion against an elite project and {{a sign of a}} general Euroscepticism among the citizens. However, it is often ignored that support for the euro fluctuates significantly over time in these countries, and hence analysing referendum outcomes simply in terms on static factors will provide only part of the explanation. In contrast to existing studies, this paper provides an analysis of the short-term dynamics in public support for the euro in the period leading up to the referendums. We thus address the question of why public attitudes towards monetary integration vary over time. We argue that {{at least part of the}} answer can be found in exchange rate fluctuations. Existing studies have neglected the fact that the national currency is not only a purely <b>monetary</b> <b>indicator,</b> but also carries symbolic weight. The public is therefore less likely to surrender their national currency when it is strong than when it is weak. They are also less willing to accept a replacement currency (e. g. the euro) when it is seen as weak vis-à-vis other world currencies. Our analysis of the two euro campaigns lends credence to our proposition that exchange rates matter. Moreover, we test impact of exchange rate changes on support of the euro using time series analysis. We find that the rapid fall in the value of the euro vis-à-vis the dollar contributed to the Danish rejection of the euro, whereas the strength of the Swedish currency made the Swedes more reluctant to relinquish their crown...|$|E

This paper is {{a case study of}} the poverty alleviation impacts of microfinance institutions and it contrasts the effects of Grameen Bank and Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) operating in Bangladesh. The case study examines the organisations effects in the 21 st century since most of the reports have compared the effects in the past not reflecting on future conditions. The questions at issue are if Grameen Bank and BRAC can affect the poverty status of its members in a positive way {{and if there is a}} positive effect, which of the approaches are the best to use? To analyse the non monetary dimension, concepts such as health and education has been used as indicators for poverty reduction and the <b>monetary</b> <b>indicator</b> used is income through employment.

The findings of this case study implied that both organisations have positive effects on reducing poverty among its members, but BRAC has the broadest view seeing to all factors investigated and therefore its approach is the best to use. Nevertheless, as previous studies have implied sustainability and cost-effectiveness within the microfinance programme is important for the long-run poverty reduction. Evaluating the economic performance of the two organisations Grameen Bank is more efficient in using its resources than BRAC, but Grameen Bank show a decreasing rate of efficiency while BRAC is improving significantly.

40|$|In an {{economic}} system that aims at sustainable development, material indicators become increasingly {{more important than}} <b>monetary</b> <b>indicators,</b> {{as much of the}} literature now testifies. <b>Monetary</b> <b>indicators</b> are often not able to reveal all the implications and interactions between the biosphere and technosphere. With this in mind, it would therefore be fruitful to combine the Material Flow Analysis (MFA) of {{an economic}} sector with the related Physical Input-Output Analysis. Indeed, MFA is able to acquire data, in physical units, of the input and output of a production chain whilst the Input Output Analysis is able to describe the material flows underlining the relationships, within the technosphere, and between the biosphere and technosphere. A strong relationship therefore exists between the two tools that provide two complementary perspectives of the same phenomenon.
