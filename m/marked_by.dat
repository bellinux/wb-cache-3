5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the period of the wars of {{independence}} itself was <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> a rapid expansion of representative government, for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> militarism {{because of the lack of}} well-defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that they got their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the caudillos, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.|$|E
