5|$|Multiple sclerosis, an {{inflammatory}} process that may produce {{a loss of}} the <b>myelin</b> sheathes which surround the cranial nerves, may cause a variety of shifting symptoms affecting multiple cranial nerves.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack of}} <b>myelin</b> starts {{inflammatory}} processes, which triggers other immune cells {{and the release}} of soluble factors like cytokines and antibodies. Further breakdown of the blood–brain barrier in turn causes a number of other damaging effects such as swelling, activation of macrophages, and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins. Inflammation can potentially reduce transmission of information between neurons in at least three ways. The soluble factors released might stop neurotransmission by intact neurons. These factors could lead to or enhance the loss of <b>myelin,</b> or they may cause the axon to break down completely.|$|E
5|$|To be specific, MS {{involves}} {{the loss of}} oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer—known as the <b>myelin</b> sheath—which helps the neurons carry electrical signals (action potentials). This results in a thinning or complete loss of <b>myelin</b> and, as the disease advances, {{the breakdown of the}} axons of neurons. When the <b>myelin</b> is lost, a neuron can no longer effectively conduct electrical signals. A repair process, called remyelination, takes place in early phases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes are unable to completely rebuild the cell's <b>myelin</b> sheath. Repeated attacks lead to successively less effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons. These scars are the origin of the symptoms and during an attack magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows more than ten new plaques. This could indicate {{that there are a number}} of lesions below which the brain is capable of repairing itself without producing noticeable consequences. Another process involved in the creation of lesions is an abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes due to the destruction of nearby neurons. A number of lesion patterns have been described.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{affects the}} {{peripheral}} nervous system (especially motor nerves) and the central nervous system. Peripheral nervous system effects are more prominent in adults and central nervous system effects are more prominent in children. Lead causes the axons of nerve cells to degenerate and lose their <b>myelin</b> coats.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{can cause}} severe {{damage to the}} brain and kidneys and, ultimately, death. By {{mimicking}} calcium, lead can cross the blood-brain barrier. It degrades the <b>myelin</b> sheaths of neurons, reduces their numbers, interferes with neurotransmission routes, and decreases neuronal growth.|$|E
5|$|Some 400 {{genes are}} {{shown to be}} brain-specific. In all neurons ELAVL3 is expressed, and in {{pyramidal}} neurons NRGN and REEP2 are also expressed. GAD1 essential for the biosynthesis of GABA is expressed in interneurons. Proteins expressed in glial cells are astrocyte markers GFAP, and S100B. <b>Myelin</b> basic protein and the transcription factor OLIG2 are expressed in oligodendrocytes.|$|E
5|$|The nerve {{dysfunction}} in Guillain–Barré {{syndrome is}} caused by an immune attack on the nerve cells of the peripheral nervous system and their support structures. The nerve cells have their body (the soma) in the spinal cord and a long projection (the axon) that carries electrical nerve impulses to the neuromuscular junction where the impulse is transferred to the muscle. Axons are wrapped in a sheath of Schwann cells that contain <b>myelin.</b> Between Schwann cells are gaps (nodes of Ranvier) where the axon is exposed. Different types of Guillain–Barré syndrome feature different types of immune attack. The demyelinating variant (AIDP, see below) features damage to the <b>myelin</b> sheath by white blood cells (T lymphocytes and macrophages); this process is preceded by activation {{of a group of}} blood proteins known as complement. In contrast, the axonal variant is mediated by IgG antibodies and complement against the cell membrane covering the axon without direct lymphocyte involvement.|$|E
5|$|The {{physiological}} {{function of the}} prion protein remains a controversial matter. While data from in vitro experiments suggest many dissimilar roles, studies on PrP knockout mice have provided only limited information because these animals exhibit only minor abnormalities. In research done in mice, {{it was found that}} the cleavage of PrP proteins in peripheral nerves causes the activation of <b>myelin</b> repair in Schwann cells and that the lack of PrP proteins caused demyelination in those cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. The {{underlying}} mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder {{in which the}} body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their <b>myelin</b> insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, surgery or vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of alternative causes, and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. There {{are a number of}} subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve conduction studies, and the presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy.|$|E
5|$|The {{three main}} {{characteristics}} of MS are {{the formation of}} lesions in {{the central nervous system}} (also called plaques), inflammation, and the destruction of <b>myelin</b> sheaths of neurons. These features interact in a complex and not yet fully understood manner to produce the breakdown of nerve tissue and in turn the signs and symptoms of the disease. Additionally, MS is believed to be an immune-mediated disorder that develops from an interaction of the individual's genetics and as yet unidentified environmental causes. Damage is believed to be caused, at least in part, by attack on the nervous system by a person's own immune system.|$|E
5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingomyelin and gangliosides {{are highly}} {{concentrated in the}} brain and support synaptogenesis and myelination. In the central nervous system, sphingomyelin is a key component of the <b>myelin</b> sheath, which insulates axons and supports efficient transmission of nerve impulses. During myelination, nerve axons are wrapped with multiple layers of cell membrane by oligodendrocyte glial cells, a process that accounts for a large portion of brain growth during late gestation and {{the first two years of}} life, but which can also continue up to 5–10 years of age. Meanwhile, gangliosides are concentrated within the brain’s gray matter and constitute approximately 6% to 10% of the total human brain lipid mass. Additionally, gangliosides are enriched at the synaptic membrane of neurons, and are functionally involved in neurotransmission and synapse formation. Brain ganglioside accretion occurs at an accelerated rate in the early years of life, coinciding with the most active period of myelination, axonal outgrowth, and synaptogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Locally, the {{disruption}} of <b>myelin</b> due to the infiltration of T cells and macrophages, results in the phagocytosis of <b>myelin</b> by microglia or macrophages, suggesting that the T cells are presented with <b>myelin</b> lipids by CD1 molecules at sites of inflammation.|$|E
25|$|After barrier {{breakdown}} symptoms may appear, such as swelling. Activation of macrophages and lymphocytes {{and their}} migration across the barrier {{may result in}} direct attacks on <b>myelin</b> sheaths within the central nervous system, leading to the characteristic demyelination event observed in MS. After demyelination has occurred, the degraded <b>myelin</b> sheath components, such as <b>myelin</b> basic proteins and <b>Myelin</b> oligodendrocyte glycoproteins, are then used as identifying factors to facilitate further immune activity upon <b>myelin</b> sheaths. Further activation of cytokines is also induced by macrophage and lymphocyte activity, promoting inflammatory activity as well continued activation of proteins such as matrix metalloproteinases, which have detrimental effect on BBB integrity.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{is a major}} {{component}} in the nervous system and is found in high levels in the <b>myelin</b> sheath in both the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. <b>Myelin</b> is typically composed of about 70 -75% lipids, and sulfatide comprises 4-7% of this 70-75%. When lacking sulfatide, <b>myelin</b> sheath is still produced around the axons; however, when lacking sulfatide the lateral loops {{and part of the}} nodes of Ranvier are disorganized, so the <b>myelin</b> sheath does not function properly. Thus, lacking sulfatide can lead to muscle weakness, tremors, and ataxia.|$|E
25|$|Some {{diseases}} degrade <b>myelin</b> and impair saltatory conduction, {{reducing the}} conduction velocity of action potentials. The most well-known {{of these is}} multiple sclerosis, in which the breakdown of <b>myelin</b> impairs coordinated movement.|$|E
25|$|NI-35 a non-permissive {{growth factor}} from <b>myelin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Demyelination is {{the act of}} demyelinating, or {{the loss}} of the <b>myelin</b> sheath {{insulating}} the nerves. When <b>myelin</b> degrades, conduction of signals along the nerve can be impaired or lost, and the nerve eventually withers. This leads to certain neurodegenerative disorders like multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.|$|E
25|$|Loss of <b>myelin</b> in {{the central}} nervous system is {{considered}} to be a main pathogenic factor. Research uses animal models carrying the underlying mutation for Niemann-Pick disease, e.g. a mutation in the NPC1 gene Niemann-Pick type C disease. In this model the expression of <b>Myelin</b> gene Regulatory Factor (MRF) has been shown to be significantly decreased. MRF is a transcription factor of critical importance in the development and maintenance of <b>myelin</b> sheaths. A perturbation of oligodendrocyte maturation and the myelination process might therefore be an underlying mechanism of the neurological deficits.|$|E
25|$|The {{malnutrition}} many alcoholics suffer deprives them {{of important}} cofactors for the oxidative metabolism of glucose. Neural tissues depend on this process for energy, and {{disruption of the}} cycle would impair cell growth and function. Schwann cells produce <b>myelin</b> that wraps around the sensory and motor nerve axons to enhance action potential conduction in the periphery. An energy deficiency in Schwann cells would account for the disappearance of <b>myelin</b> on peripheral nerves, which may result in damage to axons or loss of nerve function altogether. In peripheral nerves, oxidative enzyme activity is most concentrated around the nodes of Ranvier, making these locations most vulnerable to cofactor deprivation. Lacking essential cofactors reduces <b>myelin</b> impedance, increases current leakage, and slows signal transmission. Disruptions in conductance first affect the peripheral ends of the longest and largest peripheral nerve fibers because they suffer most from decreased action potential propagation. Thus, neural deterioration occurs in an accelerating cycle: <b>myelin</b> damage reduces conductance, and reduced conductance contributes to <b>myelin</b> degradation. The slowed conduction of action potentials in axons causes segmental demyelination extending proximally; this {{is also known as}} retrograde degeneration.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} <b>myelin</b> damage {{resulting from}} B12 deficiency, {{even in the}} presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem. It has been connected to B12 most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a <b>myelin</b> destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal fatty acid synthesis, or it will be incorporated into fatty acids itself rather than normal malonic acid. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into <b>myelin,</b> the resulting <b>myelin</b> will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is subacute combined degeneration of the central nervous system and spinal cord. Whatever the cause, it is known that B12 deficiency causes neuropathies, even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the <b>myelin.</b> <b>Myelin</b> acts as an insulating sheath that surrounds many nerve fibers and increases the speed at which impulses are conducted. When sulfatide is not distributed properly, it can affect the normal physiological conduction of electrical impulses between nerve cells. This then results in demyelination because of the buildup of sulfatide and is the main cause of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy.|$|E
25|$|Autoimmunity {{also affects}} {{sulfatide}} levels. When an enhanced antibody response against <b>myelin</b> lipids occurs, including sulfatide {{in patients with}} multiple sclerosis, the demyelination process is increased significantly. When sulfatide and gangliosides are present, the proliferation or production of Natural Killer-T cells that produce cytokines are activated. However, when CD1d deficient-mice are tested for their response to sulfatide, the same response is not seen, which indicates that in <b>myelin,</b> sulfatide is a glycolipid that possesses immunodominance.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} enable fast and {{efficient}} transduction of electrical signals in the nervous system, certain neuronal axons {{are covered with}} <b>myelin</b> sheaths. <b>Myelin</b> is a multilamellar membrane that enwraps the axon in segments separated by intervals known as nodes of Ranvier. It is produced by specialized cells: Schwann cells exclusively in the peripheral nervous system, and oligodendrocytes exclusively in the central nervous system. <b>Myelin</b> sheath reduces membrane capacitance and increases membrane resistance in the inter-node intervals, thus allowing a fast, saltatory movement of action potentials from node to node. Myelination is found mainly in vertebrates, but an analogous system has been discovered in a few invertebrates, such as some species of shrimp. Not all neurons in vertebrates are myelinated; for example, axons of the neurons comprising the autonomous nervous system are not, in general, myelinated.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of alcoholic polyneuropathy {{is an area}} {{of current}} research. Damage to the nervous system takes place before symptoms appear in individuals, beginning with segmental thinning and loss of <b>myelin</b> on the peripheral ends of the longest nerves. Segmental thinning is the demyelination of axons in small sections at a time. This occurrence increases leakage of an action potential current down the axon, so it is weakest at the peripheral end. Decrease in current causes further thinning of <b>myelin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Axonal {{degeneration}} and regeneration {{are common}} processes in many nerve disorders. As {{a consequence of}} <b>myelin</b> remodeling, the internodal length is known to remain persistently short. Little is known about how neurons cope with the increased number of nodes except {{that there may be}} a compensatory increase in Na+ channels so that the internodal density is restored. Nevertheless, most extant research findings maintain that regenerated axons may be functionally deficient, as the access to the K+ channel under the paranodal <b>myelin</b> may be increased.|$|E
25|$|New York {{researchers}} successfully cure leukodystrophy in mice {{by using}} skin cells to repair damaged <b>myelin</b> sheaths. This treatment may also prove effective in curing human multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Prolactin also stimulates {{proliferation}} of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. These cells differentiate into oligodendrocytes, the cells {{responsible for the}} formation of <b>myelin</b> coatings on axons in the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Some copepods have {{extremely}} fast escape responses when {{a predator}} is sensed, and can jump with high speed {{over a few}} millimetres. Many species have neurons surrounded by <b>myelin</b> (for increased conduction speed), which is very rare among invertebrates (other examples are some annelids and malacostracan crustaceans like palaemonid shrimp and penaeids). Even rarer, the <b>myelin</b> is highly organized, resembling the well-organized wrapping found in vertebrates (Gnathostomata). Despite their fast escape response, copepods are successfully hunted by slow-swimming seahorses, which approach their prey so gradually, it senses no turbulence, then suck the copepod into their snout too suddenly for the copepod to escape.|$|E
25|$|Neuroregeneration {{refers to}} the {{regrowth}} or repair of nervous tissues, cells or cell products. Such mechanisms may include generation of new neurons, glia, axons, <b>myelin,</b> or synapses. Neuroregeneration differs between the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) by the functional mechanisms and especially the extent and speed. When an axon is damaged, the distal segment undergoes Wallerian degeneration, losing its <b>myelin</b> sheath. The proximal segment can either die by apoptosis or undergo the chromatolytic reaction, which is an attempt at repair. In the CNS, synaptic stripping occurs as glial foot processes invade the dead synapse.|$|E
25|$|Possessing the apoE ε4 allele {{has been}} {{associated}} with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. ApoE is a protein that is involved in the transport of many lipids, including cholesterol, and thus, regulates how much sulfatide is in the central nervous system and mediates the homeostasis of the system. It has been found that higher levels of apoE are positively correlated with greater sulfatide depletion. ApoE-associated proteins take sulfatide from the <b>myelin</b> sheath and then degrade sulfatide into various compounds, such as sulfate. When apoE is increased, the amount of sulfatide that is taken from the <b>myelin</b> sheath is also increased; hence, there is more sulfatide depletion.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{is being}} {{investigated}} as potentially beneficial in treating multiple sclerosis, since the characteristic deterioration of nerve <b>myelin</b> insulation halts during pregnancy, when progesterone levels are raised; deterioration commences again when the levels drop.|$|E
25|$|Whatever the {{underlying}} condition for MS is, some damage is {{triggered by a}} CSF unknown soluble factor, which is produced in meningeal areas and diffuses into the cortical parenchyma. It destroys <b>myelin</b> {{either directly or indirectly}} through microglia activation.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide, {{also known}} as 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide, SM4, or sulfated galactocerebroside, is a class of sulfolipids, {{specifically}} a class of sulfoglycolipids, which are glycolipids that contain a sulfate group. Sulfatide is synthesized primarily starting in the endoplasmic reticulum and ending in the Golgi apparatus where ceramide is converted to galactocerebroside and later sulfated to make sulfatide. Of all of the galactolipids that {{are found in the}} <b>myelin</b> sheath, one fifth of them are sulfatide. Sulfatide is primarily found on the extracellular leaflet of the <b>myelin</b> plasma membrane produced by the oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and in the Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. However, sulfatide is also present on the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane of many cells in eukaryotic organisms.|$|E
25|$|In {{the brain}} (type II and III), glucosylceramidase accumulates {{due to the}} {{turnover}} of complex lipids during brain development {{and the formation of}} the <b>myelin</b> sheath of nerves. The exact mechanism of neurotoxicity is not understood, but it is thought to involve a reaction to glucosylsphingosine.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, HIV-1-infected {{patients}} often {{suffer from}} <b>myelin</b> degeneration {{in the central}} nervous system. These patients have elevated levels of sulfatide in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and anti-sulfatide antibodies in the serum. Elevated levels of anti-sulfatide antibodies can cause demyelination. This {{is caused by the}} binding of the anti-sulfatide antibodies {{to the surface of the}} <b>myelin</b> sheath and/or the surface of Schwann Cells, which then activates a complete cascade of demyelination. Also, advanced stage AIDS patients can develop Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). Guillain–Barré syndrome is classified as an acute autoimmune polyneuropathy, which specifically affects the peripheral nervous system of the infected patient. Experimentation has shown that anti-sulfatide autoimmune antibodies may contribute to the development of Guillain–Barré syndrome in AIDS patients as well as the development of peripheral nervous system injury in HIV-1 infected patients.|$|E
25|$|Thin neurons and axons {{require less}} {{metabolic}} expense {{to produce and}} carry action potentials, but thicker axons convey impulses more rapidly. To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction, many neurons have insulating sheaths of <b>myelin</b> around their axons. The sheaths are formed by glial cells: oligodendrocytes in {{the central nervous system}} and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. The sheath enables action potentials to travel faster than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter, whilst using less energy. The <b>myelin</b> sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about 1mm long, punctuated by unsheathed nodes of Ranvier, which contain a high density of voltage-gated ion channels. Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that results from demyelination of axons in the central nervous system.|$|E
