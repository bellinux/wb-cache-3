40|$|The Salmonella microsomal assay {{has become}} an {{indispensible}} tool for the screening of mutagens and carcinogens, particularly when {{a large number of}} samples have to be tested, as in the present context for the screening of air pollution. However, for a more definite identification of potential carcinogens, a verification of the results from bacterial tests has to be performed with a battery of other tests, including point mutations and chromosomal aberrations in eukoaryotic systems. While there is a close qualitative correlation between the mutagenic and carcinogenic property of chemicals, a corresponding quantitative correlation between the mutagenic and carcinogenic potency is not always found.

Strains of S. typhimurium LT 2, TA 100, when exposed to either sodium dichromate or the fumes from the welding of stainless steel, develop colonies whose apparent numbers are directly in proportion to the Cr(VI) content per plate in both cases, over a wide dose range. Replica impressions of the resulting colonies were transferred to Vogel Bonner minimal agar plates and incubated for 48 hr at 37 degrees C. It was then observed that considerable numbers of "false" revertant colonies were obtained at those Cr(VI) doses which resulted in a pronounced toxic effect, albeit with an acceptable level of the bacterial background lawn. No morphological distinction between "true" and "false" revertant colonies could be made. Although it would appear that at low doses (i. e., low toxicity) the true mutagenicity of stainless steel welding fumes can be completely accounted for by the presence of Cr(VI), the dose range over which the mutagenicity assay is reliable cannot be estimated from examination of the background lawn or from an estimate of the degree of survival of the treated cultures.
