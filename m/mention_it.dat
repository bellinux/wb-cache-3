5|$|Following the forfeiture, most of Garmoran {{remained}} with the Scottish crown until 1469, when James III granted Lairdship {{of it to}} John of Ross, the new MacDonald leader, who passed it to his own half-brother, Hugh of Sleat. Clan Ranald objected to the transfer to Hugh, and appear to have retained some level of physical posession, {{regardless of whether they}} any legal authority to do so. The status of Rùm during this period is unclear, as surviving records do not <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> as part of Hugh's possessions.|$|E

50|$|Kontopouli {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 1739, during the Turkish rule, by Pococke as Ontopol. In 1788 Choiseul-Gouffier <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> on his map as a nameless village, and in 1858 Conze <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> as Kondopuli. From the early 19th century, the village developed {{into the main}} village of northeast Lemnos. In 1856, 370 men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 50 paid 11,840 kuruş in order to avoid army conscription, which underlines the importance of the village. Conze <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> as a large, tall and comfortably situated village.|$|R

5|$|Prior to May 18, Kehoe had {{loaded the}} back seat of his truck with metal debris capable of {{producing}} shrapnel during an explosion. He also bought a new set of tires for his truck to avoid breaking down when transporting the explosives.

A neighbor allegedly saw Kehoe carrying objects into the school building at night numerous times but never thought to <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> to anyone.|$|E
5|$|Lundomys molitor {{was first}} {{described}} in 1887 by Danish zoologist Herluf Winge, who reviewed the materials Peter Wilhelm Lund had {{collected in the}} caves of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Winge used four specimens for his description, including two skull fragments and an isolated maxilla (upper jaw) from the cave chamber Lapa da Escrivania Nr.5 and a mandible (lower jaw) from Lapa da Serra das Abelhas, but the latter later {{turned out to be}} from a different species, probably Gyldenstolpia fronto. Lund named the animal Hesperomys molitor and placed it in the same genus (Hesperomys) as what is now Pseudoryzomys simplex and two species of Calomys. Subsequently, it was rarely mentioned in the literature on South American rodents; those authors who did <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> placed it in either Oryzomys or Calomys.|$|E
5|$|Other {{articles}} {{dealt with}} punishing specific persons, foremost among these, Piers Gaveston. Article 20 describes at length the offenses committed by Gaveston; {{he was once}} more condemned to exile and was to abjure the realm by 1 November. The bankers of the Italian Frescobaldi company were arrested, and their goods seized. It was held that the king’s great financial dependence on the Italians was politically unfortunate. The last individuals to be singled out for punishment were Henry de Beaumont and his sister, Isabella de Vescy, two foreigners associated with the king’s household. Though {{it is difficult to}} say why these two received particular <b>mention,</b> <b>it</b> could be related to the central position of their possessions in the Scottish war.|$|E

5|$|Sources {{are silent}} {{regarding}} the events following the first Persian campaign but the silence {{in itself is}} an indication of the peace that prevailed and that the Persians stopped being a threat to the Roman East. The evidence for the second campaign is meager; Zosimus is the only one to <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> specifically. A passage in the Sibylline Oracles is interpreted by Hartmann as an indication of the second invasion. The campaign took place in 266 or 267 and was aimed directly at Ctesiphon; Odaenathus reached the walls of the Persian capital but had to cancel the siege and march north to face the influx of Germanic riders attacking Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|Ever since Joseph Merrick's days as {{a novelty}} exhibit on Whitechapel Road, his {{condition}} {{has been a source}} of curiosity for medical professionals. His appearance at the meeting of the Pathological Society of London in 1884 drew interest from the doctors present, but none of the answers nor the attention that Treves had hoped for. The case received only a brief mention in the British Medical Journal, and the Lancet declined to <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> at all. Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed, and the Elephant Man had moved on. Without Merrick, Treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations. One of the doctors present at the meeting was Henry Radcliffe Crocker, a dermatologist who was an authority on skin diseases. After hearing Treves's description of Merrick, and viewing the photographs, Crocker proposed that Merrick's condition might be a combination of dermatolysis, pachydermatocele and an unnamed bone deformity, all caused by changes in the nervous system. Crocker wrote about Merrick's case in his 1888 book Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment.|$|E
5|$|Opinion amongst modern historians is also split; for instance, Fine {{accepts the}} concept of the Peace of Callias, whereas Sealey {{effectively}} rejects it. Holland accepts that some kind of accommodation was made between Athens and Persia, but no actual treaty. Fine argues that Callisthenes's denial that a treaty was made after the Eurymedon does not preclude a peace being made at another point. Further, he suggests that Theopompus was actually referring to a treaty that had allegedly been negotiated with Persia in 423 BC. If these views are correct, it would remove one major obstacle to the acceptance of the treaty's existence. A further argument for the existence of the treaty is the sudden withdrawal of the Athenians from Cyprus in 449 BC, which Fine suggests makes most sense in the light of some kind of peace agreement. On the other hand, if there was indeed some kind of accommodation, Thucydides's failure to <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> is odd. In his digression on the pentekontaetia, his aim is to explain the growth of Athenian power, and such a treaty, {{and the fact that the}} Delian allies were not released from their obligations after it, would have marked a major step in the Athenian ascendancy. Conversely, it has been suggested that certain passages elsewhere in Thucydides's history are best interpreted as referring to a peace agreement. There is thus no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to the treaty's existence.|$|E
