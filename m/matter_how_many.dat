5|$|Although 0 is {{divisible}} by 2 {{more times}} than any other number, it is not straightforward to quantify exactly how many times that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be {{the number of times}} n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> times it is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. This convention is not peculiar to the 2-order; {{it is one of the}} axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E

By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically.

5|$|Wallace began {{investigating}} spiritualism in {{the summer}} of 1865, possibly at the urging of his older sister Fanny Sims, who had been involved with it for some time. After reviewing the literature on the topic and attempting to test the phenomena he witnessed at séances, he came to accept that the belief was connected to a natural reality. For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some séance phenomena were genuine, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism. It has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier, when his first fiancée broke their engagement, contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism. Other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead Wallace's desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena, both material and non-material, of the natural world and of human society.|$|E

50|$|According to the {{documentary}} hypothesis, {{the first five}} books of the Bible (Pentateuch/Torah), including Genesis, were collated during the 5th century BC from four main sources, which themselves date from no earlier than the 10th century BC. Two of these, the Jahwist, composed in the 10th century BC, and the Priestly source, from the late 7th century BC, make up the chapters of Genesis which concern Noah.

Unemployment, the elder survival, the family planning, the education, the youth problems, the immigrated population are some of the questions posed to the interviewees.

But even by the more limited definition a full examination {{of the history of the}} fantastic in literature is necessary to show the origins of the modern genre. Traditional works contain significant elements which modern fantasy authors have drawn upon extensively for inspiration in their own works.|$|E

The bomber units had been hardest hit having only 232 out of a force of 480 left. The Luftwaffe still held air superiority but clearly its strength was being eroded. The Russian output of aircraft continued unabated—no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> enemy machines were destroyed, more appeared, while its own much smaller losses, particularly among the crews, were becoming serious.

He doesn't believe the question about God's existence should be an opinion held by one group and differently by another no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> demonstrations are made.

25|$|In Pakistan, stamp {{programmes}} are not {{issued in}} advance. Earlier, collectors could almost {{always count on}} stamps being issued {{on at least two}} dates: 23 March and 14 August.

However, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> issues are released, their total cost rarely exceeds Rs. 300/- (approx USD 5). Besides postage stamps and souvenir sheets, the post office also sells first day covers, leaflets with and without stamps on it and postal stationery. Earlier, the post office did not use any specific numbering system but this changed when they started using a rather simple system on their leaflets: xxxx – y where xxxx is the year and y is the issue number within that year. All major catalogues include Pakistani stamps in them. Two local updated catalogues are available, each of which uses its own system of numbering.|$|E
25|$|In {{the western}} part of the country, water {{ownership}} is controlled by the appropriative system. This system states that the owner of a piece of land does not automatically own the rights to water found on that land. Rights to water belong to the first user who puts the water to beneficial use. The first people to become appropriators of the water source have the right to continue using the water in the same quantity as always as long as they continue putting the water to good use. This holds true no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> other people wish to use the water. The latest water appropriator loses all of their water rights before any water rights are taken from the next latest appropriator. The Fort Belknap Reservation in Montana, which had been created by the government in 1888, experienced issues with the appropriative water system when water flow to their reservation was being diverted to settlements of non American Indians.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} her B.A. {{degree from}} Bryn Mawr in 1963, Oughton {{spent the next}} two years in Guatemala with the American Friends Service Committee program (AFSC). Nearly half the women from Oughton's college senior class had gone on to graduate school. Oughton was assigned to Chichicastenango, at that time an isolated Indian market town. Oughton went to Guatemala as a liberal, believing that the problems could be identified and solutions devised and carried out. Eventually, she became a radical, and began to feel an urgency to change everything at once. While there, Oughton worked with young adults and older indigenous people to teach them to read. She helped local Catholic priests implement nutritional programs and edited a left-wing Guatemalan newspaper. Oughton lived in a small house with a dirt floor and a little outhouse. During this time, the questions with which she had struggled with came to a head. Oughton questioned what to do about poverty, social injustice, and revolution in the world. Oughton {{came to the conclusion that}} no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> hours were spent working to feed and educate, there would always be more people than jobs to earn wages, inadequate food supplies, and never enough shelter to protect people from the elements.|$|E
30|$|So far we {{have assumed}} that the {{algorithm}} finds the correct cluster allocation every time (CI[*]=[*] 0). This can be argued by the pigeonhole principle: there are k pigeons and k pigeonholes. In a correct solution, exactly one pigeon (prototype) occupies one pigeon hole (cluster). The solution for this problem can be found by a sequence of swaps: by swapping pigeons from over-crowded holes to the empty ones. It is just a <b>matter</b> of <b>how</b> <b>many</b> trial swaps are needed to make it happen. We do not have formal proof that this would always happen but {{it is unlikely that}} the algorithm would get stuck in sub-optimal solution with wrong cluster allocation (CI[*]>[*] 0).
