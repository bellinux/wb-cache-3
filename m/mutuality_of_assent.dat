50|$|McMichael v. Price, 58 P.2d 549 (OK 1936), {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the Supreme Court of Oklahoma that held that a {{constraint}} on discretion was enough to ensure <b>mutuality</b> <b>of</b> obligation in a requirements contract.|$|R

50|$|The Supreme Court of Oklahoma {{affirmed the}} verdict for the plaintiff. McMichael {{argued that this}} was an illusory promise because it lacked <b>mutuality</b> <b>of</b> {{obligation}} - he contended that the plaintiff could escape all contract liability for simply refusing to sell sand. The court held that the contract did have <b>mutuality</b> <b>of</b> obligation because the contract constrained Price's discretion. Price was required to buy all the sand that he would sell from McMichael, so if he {{wanted to be in the}} sand business he was bound to buy from McMichael. The court noted that Price was an experienced sand salesmen, and that while the parties were in business Price was making a profit.|$|R

These decisions are split on the question <b>of</b> <b>assent,</b> with the former holding that only objective manifestation <b>of</b> <b>assent</b> is required while the latter require at least the possibility <b>of</b> subjective <b>assent.</b>|$|R
