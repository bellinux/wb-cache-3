40|$|Batching of {{concrete}} is generally the proportioning {{of the different}} constituents {{of concrete}} before mixing which could be by weight or volume. Mix design is better to achieve a concrete of desired properties. Standardized Prescribed Concrete (SPC) mix design is mostly adopted in mass concreting to high strength concreting applications in most developing nations. British standards accept volume batching for SPC only in mass concrete (20 MPa) recommended to be batched by weight. Designs batched by volume {{have been identified as}} the most commonly used method in concrete production in Nigeria and most developing nations, especially by medium to small scale construction firms. This research work developed a modified volume <b>batch</b> <b>mix</b> design that will be equivalent to SPC design <b>mix,</b> <b>batched</b> by weight in normal and higher strength concrete. The physical properties of the constituent concrete materials, fine aggregate, 12 mm and 19 mm sized coarse aggregates were determined. The strength of SPC mix of ST 2, ST 4 and ST 5 to British standard were determined when batched by weight and their volume equivalents mix-design batch determined. The strengths of these SPC <b>mixes</b> were <b>batched</b> by volume and their weight equivalent batch-design determined. A relationship was determined between both batching mix-design methods for all the prescribed mixes and strengths using the binder-aggregate and coarse-fine aggregate ratios, such that the preferred weight <b>batching</b> design <b>mix</b> could be achieved by a modified <b>mix</b> design <b>batched</b> by volume. This study concludes that concrete <b>mix</b> design <b>batched</b> by weight is superior to when batched by volume and the desired design batching by weight could be achieved by generating a modified mix-design-batch by volume.

The data were collected in a commercial slaughterhouse and included 93 batches, with a total of 2, 520   animals,  from different regions of South Brazil. After evisceration, the bruises were identified and recorded in  the different carcass regions: hip, round, ribs, forequarter and loin area per animal and batch. The weights of the removed tissue due to bruising was based on the average weights of various samples of bruises according to their degree of severity. Regarding the number of bruises per animal, no differences (P> 0. 05) were observed between genetic groups, however, when comparing the total bruises per batch, differences were observed in all carcass regions, except for the forequarter, with more number of injuries in zebu than in taurine carcasses. The individual assessment showed 86. 2 % (P<. 05) more bruises in the ribs region in horned than in polled animals  carcasses. Horned batches had higher bruises mean  (P<. 05) compared to the polled, with increases of 65. 1; 131. 7 e 132. 8 % in total bruises in the carcass, ribs and forequarter, respectively.
