50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Carl Ross {{extended}} the frozen fish business to become Ross Foods and acquired Youngs shellfish company. In 1956 Ross secured twenty North Sea skippers through acquisition, and {{built up a}} Bird and Cat class North Sea and <b>Middle</b> <b>Water</b> trawler enterprise which went on to acquire the Cochrane yards at Selby. At its peak, the Ross Group owned the largest fishing fleet in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Four major water masses {{originating}} in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans meet in the Norwegian Sea, and the associated currents are of fundamental importance for the global climate. The warm, salty North Atlantic Current flows in from the Atlantic Ocean, and the colder and less saline Norwegian Current originates in the North Sea. The so-called East Iceland Current transports cold water south from the Norwegian Sea toward Iceland and then east, along the Arctic Circle; this current occurs in the <b>middle</b> <b>water</b> layer. Deep water flows into the Norwegian Sea from the Greenland Sea. The tides in the sea are semi-diurnal; that is, they rise twice a day, to a height of about 3.3 metres.|$|E

50|$|Bloodfin tetras are {{typically}} kept in schools {{of five or}} more. They swim mainly in the upper and <b>middle</b> <b>water</b> layers and are highly sociable fishes, mixing well {{with other types of}} tetras and tropical fish in general, so are often kept (like many other tetras) in a community tank. However, they will tend to nip at the fins of fish with long, wavy fins, such as angelfish or guppies. Bloodfin tetras have also been kept in cold-water tanks, provided the temperature does not drop below room temperature. They have been kept in temperatures ranging from 64-83°F. Tetras are adapted to soft, slightly acidic water, and soft water is essential for breeding. Bloodfin tetras can adapt to many water conditions in captivity, if the tap water is dechlorinated.|$|E
50|$|The {{large and}} small gyms, locker rooms, and {{swimming}} pool, {{on the south side}} of the quad, are also original. The big gym, home to basketball, volleyball, badminton, and several families of small birds which build nests in the old lights in the ceiling, received a new paint job in 2006 courtesy of the Don's Club. The pool deck has two pools, the 12-foot diving well and the 6-lane pool, which is 3.5 feet at the ends and 4 in the <b>middle.</b> <b>Water</b> polo cannot be played at Del Mar because of the pool's depth, or lack thereof. There are seven tennis courts, four outdoor basketball courts, two sand volleyball courts that are rarely used, the weight room, a football practice field, a baseball diamond, three softball/baseball fields, and a large field that houses soccer. There is also the Bowl, housing the brand new artificial-turf athletic field and appropriately new rubber track which is used for field hockey, soccer, and football.|$|E
50|$|As a <b>middle</b> <b>water</b> trawler {{she would}} work the North Sea, Faroe Islands and the Norwegian coast, {{although}} {{is capable of}} making trips further north. The larger 'deep water' vessels would commonly take on the hazardous Arctic oceans including Bear Island and Greenland. Ross Revenge, {{better known as the}} radio ship Radio Caroline belonged to the deep water fleet of Ross Trawlers and is still in existence today, preserved in her radio ship form.The smaller vessels of the Ross fleet, designed for waters closer to home, were known as the 'Bird Class' or 'Bird Boats' and were named after birds, for example, Ross Falcon and Ross Mallard.As Ross Tiger was the first of her kind, subsequent Cat Class vessels saw minor alterations to the design. This included slightly extending the bridge top to allow for larger side-light screens and the addition of bobbin derricks to the bridge verandah to assist in working the trawl. Most of the class built after 1958 featured a flat transom, although Ross Jackal of 1960 was given the original rounded transom as seen on Ross Tiger. Despite these few alterations the vessels of the class were, in most respects, identical sisters.Today, what was once the largest fishing port in the world has only a handful of small fishing craft and no deep water fleet.The recent controversial loss of the PS Lincoln Castle gave cause for concern that the town was losing touch with its once Great status, with the Grimsby Telegraph quoting NE Lincs Council as stating 'it would not be right to burden council taxpayers with the bill' to keep the steamer in the town.Fishing the way that Ross Tiger did, the handling of the heavy trawl equipment of a sidewinder, the open decks and low rails and the long hours in the elements gutting fish by hand on deck is thankfully far from the ways of the modern deep sea trawlers of today.The only reminder in Grimsby of what people {{in this part of the}} world did for so long, on this traditional design of trawler, is the uniquely surviving Ross Tiger.|$|E

40|$|Given humankind’s {{ability to}} {{dramatically}} affect the natural systems that support life on our planet, {{what is the}} designer’s role in building empathic consciousness towards our biosphere? Our consciousness is the gestalt effect of what we know, feel, and believe. The built environment is both illustrator and shaper of this shared consciousness. Our attitude toward the biosphere {{is a product of}} the ways the industrial revolution shaped our landscape, economy, social organization, governance, art, and design. This thesis uses a site in Holyoke, Massachusetts (160 <b>Middle</b> <b>Water</b> St.), to test theories about how spaces change the way we think, feel, and act toward our planet. Holyoke, the first planned industrial city in the nation, is a cultural landscape that tells the story of reshaping natural systems for human benefit. The program for the space emerges from the budding creative economy in Holyoke. Specifically, movement artists are using dance to build community, increase health and fitness, and express emotional experience. 160 <b>Middle</b> <b>Water</b> offers a vision for this engagement, connecting dancers to the earth, river, and sky. This thesis builds on the precedents of landscape architects, architects, sculptors, scientists, poets, and ecologists who have shaped our built environment and framed our view of the world.

This bloom was developed with the competition of Chaetoceros debilis and Skeletonema spp. The highest cell density of T. curviseriata, which has reached 1. 27 x 10 (6) cells/dm(3), was found in the surface and <b>middle</b> <b>water</b> layers of Stas ZD, ZB in the East China Sea (27. 22 degrees similar to 29. 48 degrees N, 121. 53 degrees similar to 122. 98 degrees E) in early spring in 2005. During the blooming period of T. curviseriata, the population with high cell density was found in the water area with temperature of 10 similar to 15 degrees C and salinity of 29. 0 similar to 33. 5. The percentage of the predominant species, T. curviseriata, has reached 95. 8 % of total diatom cells at one time in the <b>middle</b> <b>water</b> layer. The morphological characteristics of T. curviseriata, were observed with light microscope (LM) and transmission electronic microscope (TEM). The cells are 5. 0 similar to 12. 6 mu m in diameter, connecting each other by mucilaginous thread to form spiral and curved chains. Description and LM and TEM images of T. curviseriata are presented. T. curviseriata is ecologically characterized by eurythermy and euryhalinity, and its population variation is affected mainly by silicate, the ratios of phosphorus to silicon and nitrogen to silicon.

40|$|Ten marine surface {{samples were}} {{collected}} in Potter Cove, King George Island, Antarctica in austral summer 2010 from water depth from 25 up to 114 m and were counted for recent benthic foraminifera. 27 benthic species were found, which consist of 66, 7 % calcareous and 33, 3 % agglutinated forms. The highest amount of foraminifera per gram was developed at a <b>middle</b> <b>water</b> depth and a middle distance to the glacier. Three Zones with foraminiferal communities were recognized, which characteristics like diversity and occurrence were con- trolled by different environmental factors. The most important influencing factor {{seems to be the}} water depth and the distance to the glacier in contrast to the sediments, which seem not to influence the foraminiferal distribution.

Our technique coarsens the Eulerian fluid grid during the pressure solve, allowing for a fast implicit update but still maintaining the resolution obtained with a large grid. This allows our simulations to run {{at a fraction of}} the cost of existing techniques while still providing the fine scale structure and details obtained with a full projection. Our algorithm scales well to very large grids and large numbers of processors, allowing for high fidelity simulations that would otherwise be intractable...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study {{compared}} various morphological {{characteristics of}} S. hilarii, {{in order to}} verify possible variations {{over the life of}} the fish. It was used individuals collected from the Tietê river basin (sub-basins of Sorocaba, Jacaré Pepira and Corumbataí rivers) and from the Rio Grande basin (sub-basins of Pardo and Mogi Guaçu rivers). For the analysis we used 15 relative values of morphological attributes. Measures of S. hilarii were taken from samples with a range of size ranging between 49 - 430 mm standard length. The relative values were first analyzed by an array of Principal Component Analysis of correlation (PCA). Subsequently the most important attributes of PCA were correlated with standard length, using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The PCA revealed eight most important characteristics, and six showed a significant correlation with standard lengths (relative height, depth ratio, relative area of caudal fin, relative head length, eye diameter relative height and relative mouth height), indicating common variations along the fish&# 8217;s growth besides indicating an adaptation to the conditions of the environment it occupies.

40|$|Multibeam volume {{acoustic}} backscatterimagery and reverberation {{measurements are}} derived from data collected in 200 -m-deep waters in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, with the Toroidal Volume Search Sonar (TVSS), a 68 -kHz cylindrical sonar operated by the U. S. Navy’s Coastal System Station. The TVSS’s 360 -degree vertical imaging plane allows simultaneous identification of multiple volume scattering sources and their discrimination from backscatter at the sea surface or the seafloor. This imaging capability is used to construct a three-dimensional representation of a pelagic fish school near the bottom. Scattering layers imaged in the mixed layer and upper thermocline are attributed to assemblages of epipelagic zooplankton. The fine scale patchiness of these scatterers is assessed with the two-dimensional variance spectra of vertical volume scattering strength images in the upper and <b>middle</b> <b>water</b> column. Mean volume reverberation levels exhibit a vertical directionality which is attributed to the volume scattering layers. Boundary echo sidelobe interference and reverberation is shown to be the major limitation in obtaining bioacoustic data with the TVSS. Because net tow and trawl samples were not collected with the acoustic data, the analysis presented is based upon comparison to previous biologic surveys in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico and reference to the bioacoustic literature...|$|E
