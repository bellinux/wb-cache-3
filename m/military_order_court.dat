5000|$|Punishment for disobedience is {{regulated}} in the Wehrstrafgesetz (military penal law). Germany {{does not have}} any military courts; civilian courts have jurisdiction over military law. Subordinates who do not execute <b>military</b> <b>orders</b> with claim to obedience may be punished with imprisonment up to three years (in cases with [...] "severe consequences" [...] up to five years). [...] "Severe consequences" [...] means that the result of the disobedience either would have grave consequences for the security of Germany or for the combat worthiness of the forces, or that it caused death or severe bodily harm to another person. Insubordination is the oral or physical revolt against <b>military</b> <b>orders</b> or the denial (in spite of repetition) of an order, and may be punished with imprisonment up to three years. In case of an initial revolt against a <b>military</b> <b>order,</b> a <b>court</b> could withhold sentencing if the subordinate executed the order voluntarily and in time afterwards. If subordinates avoided executing orders frivolously, they could also be sentenced to imprisonment up to two years in cases of severe consequences.|$|R

I am glad that, so far as there can be between a young knight and one of middle age, there is a {{friendship}} between us. But see what greater pleasure it would give to my life were you my son, for whom I could lay by such funds as I could well spare, instead of spending all my appointments on myself, and having neither kith nor kin to give a sigh of regret when the news comes that I have fallen in some engagement with the infidels. I often think of all these things, and sometimes talk them over with comrades, and there are few who do not hold, with me, {{that it would be}} far better that we should become a purely <b>military</b> <b>Order,</b> like some of the <b>military</b> <b>Orders</b> in the <b>courts</b> of the European sovereigns, than remain as we are, half monk, half soldier--a mixture that, so far as I can see, accords but badly with either morality or public repute.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1994, the IDF {{issued an}} {{eviction}} order, which provoked tribe members {{to appeal to}} the Supreme Court of Israel which rejected their appeal. Throughout the 1990s there were 100-120 <b>military</b> or <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> for the eviction of al-Jahalin Bedouin. The mass eviction occurred in 1996 when all 4,000 members of ʿArab al-Jahalin tribe were evicted from their encampments. However, in 1998, another appeal resulted in a deal between the Israeli Civil Administration and representatives of 35 al-Jahalin families (about 200 individuals) who were permitted to [...] "lease state lands" [...] that originally belonged to the Palestinian town of Abu Dis. Thus, the village of ʿArab al-Jahalin was founded.|$|R
