25|$|Today Henry Hope is {{best known}} for his summer home, the Villa Welgelegen. Thanks to his command of English, French, and Dutch, he was adept at {{establishing}} far-flung business relationships, and he had many influential friends. He acquired a large art collection and built the villa Welgelegen in Haarlem to house the collection. The villa was erected on the grounds of a former summer home he had acquired in 1769 on the Haarlem border of Heemstede. Building this summer palace, a five-year project, became a summer attraction in its own right, rivaling the neighboring park, Groenendaal, established in Heemstede by his cousin, partner, and neighbor, Jan (John) Hope. In 1781, Henry started receiving uninvited visitors to view the gardens and expansion process. The execution of these ambitious plans did not seem to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>dent</b> <b>in</b> his enormous wealth; in 1782, he purchased Hope Lodge (Fort Washington, Pennsylvania) as a wedding gift for the son of his American cousin, Maria Ellis.|$|E

The songs were co-written with Martin Page. [...] "Citizen Jane" [...] and [...] "Friend of the Flag" [...] were released as singles.

2500|$|With little serious {{record company}} interest, the band took the {{initiative}} and made {{up a handful of}} demos of their latest recording [...] "Firebird Special", sending them out to their favourite record labels. US company Sympathy for the Record Industry were one such label and they immediately issued [...] "Firebird Special" [...] as a 7" [...] single in the USA and followed it up with a full-length CD album [...] "Unsafe.. At Any Speed". The album brought together their last couple of singles with a batch of new recordings and was a hit on the US underground/college circuit. As a result of this modest success, the band played a handful of US gigs but with no UK distribution and an indifferent UK music press, [...] "Unsafe" [...] failed to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>dent</b> <b>in</b> the domestic market. A further single [...] "Ya Just A Little Punk" [...] followed, this time on indie 555 label, but the lack of success and nominal interest from the UK press may have prompted Jack to accept an offer to join The Wedding Present, first on bass and later on guitar.|$|E
