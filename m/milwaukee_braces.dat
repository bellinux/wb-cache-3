The aim of this review is to present appropriate research to collect and evaluate possible in-brace corrections which have been achieved with brace treatment for hyperkyphosis. This paper introduces new methods of bracing and compares the results of these with other successful bracing concepts. Materials and methods 56 adolescents with the diagnosis of thoracic Scheuermann's hyperkyphosis or a thoracic idiopathic hyperkyphosis (22 girls and 34 boys) with an average age of 14 years (12 - 17 yrs.) were treated with the kyphologic™ brace between May 2007 and December 2008. The average Stagnara angle was 55, 6 ° (43 - 80). In-brace correction was recorded and compared to the initial angle using the t-test. Results The average Stagnara angle in the brace was 39 °. The average in-brace correction was 16. 5 ° (1 - 40 °). The verage percentage of in-brace correction compared to the initial value was 36 %. The differences were significant in the t-test (t = 5. 31, p Discussion If we assume that outcome of brace treatment positively correlates with in-brace correction, the treatment should be initiated before the curvature angle exceeds 50 - 55 ° in a growing adolescent. In scoliosis bracing, if the average in-brace correction equals > 15 °, then it is predicted that the result will lead to a final correction. Applying this to hyperkyphosis patients, the average in-brace correction with this brace was also > 15 °. We therefore estimated to achieve a favourable outcome using this brace type (once compliance was attained) especially when comparing the correction effects achieved with this new approach to the correction effects reported upon using the Milwaukee brace. The latter brace has been shown to lead to beneficial outcomes in long-term studies with comparable in-brace corrections. Conclusion Conservative treatment of Scheuermann's hyperkyphosis in international literature is generally regarded as an effective treatment approach. Physiotherapy and bracing are the first-line treatments for this condition. An average in-brace correction of > 15 ° as was achieved using the kyphologic™ brace predicts a favourable outcome. The kyphologic™ brace leads to in-brace corrections comparable to those of the Milwaukee brace, which has previously been shown to provide beneficial outcome in the long-term. A prospective follow-up study seems desirable before final conclusions can be drawn. Future studies should focus more on thoracolumbar and lumbar curve patterns, because these patterns may predict chronic low back pain in adulthood with reduced quality of life of the patients and high costs with respect to medical care and occupational sickness leave. Surgery according to international literature is rarely necessary in this condition. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effectiveness}} of bracing on preventing curve progression in coronal plane for mild and moderate adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients {{has been confirmed}} by previous radiographic researches. However, a hypokyphotic effect on the sagittal plane has been reported by a few studies. A relatively increasing number of AIS patients were noticed to wear {{a new kind of}} elastic orthotic belt for the treatments of scoliosis without doctors' instructions. We postulate the correcting mechanism of this new appliance may cause flattening of the spine. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the effects of this new orthosis on the sagittal profile of AIS patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare the effects of elastic orthotic belt and <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> on the sagittal alignment in AIS patients. Methods Twenty-eight female AIS patients with mild or moderate thoracic curves were included in this study. Standing full-length lateral radiographs were obtained in three conditions: natural standing posture without any treatment, with elastic orthotic belt and with <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace.</b> Thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumber lordosis (LL) and pelvic incidence (PI) were measured and compared between the above three conditions. Results Both elastic orthotic belt and <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> can lead to significant decrease of TK, however, the decrease of TK after wearing elastic orthotic belt is significantly larger than that after wearing <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace.</b> Compared with no treatment, LL was found to be significantly smaller after wearing <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace,</b> however, such significant decrease was not noted after wearing elastic orthotic belt. No significant changes were observed for the PI between 3 conditions.

40|$|Background: Scheuermann's {{disease is}} {{regarded}} as {{the most common cause of}} structural hyperkyphosis within adolescents without any proper treatment. It may lead to progressive deformity and back pain which influences patient's quality of life during adolescence and adulthood. Treatment approach to Scheuermann's kyphosis has not been clearly defined due to its different definitions and obscure natural history. The goal of treatment is not only to prevent progression but also to obtain permanent correction. <b>Bracing,</b> especially <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> and physiotherapy are two of the common nonoperative treatment modalities. Hence, the present study intended to evaluate the effectiveness of <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> on progression control as well as correction of Scheuermann's kyphosis. Materials and Methods: In a retrospective, observational study, all the patients diagnosed with Scheuermann's kyphosis were reviewed in 2003 – 2013, who were treated by <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> at a single center. There was a minimum of 2 -year follow-up after completion of bracing, during which clinical and radiological parameters were identified and recorded. Results: The mean angle of kyphosis in these patients at the presentation was 63. 24 ± 9. 96 and at the end of this study was 36. 5 ° ± 13. 4 ° (P < 0. 001). Moreover, mean improved angle in those patients with < 75 ° of kyphosis was 25. 26 ° ± 7. 78 ° and in those with 75 ° or more than 75 ° of kyphosis was 26. 77 ° ± 19. 76 ° (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Conservative treatment with <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> and physiotherapy was effective in our hand for halting kyphosis progression in 97. 5 % of Scheuermann's kyphosis, which could be advised for cases up to 90 ° of kyphosis before skeletal maturity. As a result, a trial of brace treatment could be recommended in patients with severe kyphosis (up to 90 °) which can open a new insight in conservative treatment of Scheuermann's kyphosis...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> was a {{very common}} brace towards the earlier part {{of the twentieth century}} in the United States. It is a largely {{symmetrical}} brace. The brace is made with a harness-like hip area and metal strips rising to the chin, where a collar is. Between the hips and chin, there are corrective thrusts given with large pads. There is little rotational correction. Today this brace is generally used for very high thoracic curves that are severe and out of range of the Boston. This brace is typically worn 20-23 hours a day.|$|R
50|$|Since {{it lacks}} the metal {{superstructure}} of the <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace,</b> which was the most commonly worn brace until {{the development of the}} Boston brace, the brace is typically not noticeable under clothing. The Boston brace is prescribed for correcting curves in the lumbar or thoraco-lumbar part of the spine. It is designed to keep the lumbar area of the body in a flexed position by pushing the abdomen in and flattening the posterior lumbar contour. Pads are placed at the apex of the curves to provide pressure, and areas of relief from pressure are positioned opposite the curves.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>Brace</b> was {{developed}} by Dr Walter Blount of Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the mid 1940 's as a removable postoperative immobilization device {{for the treatment of}} neuromuscular scoliosis patients. This was quickly adopted as a nonoperative treatment device for idiopathic scoliosis. The first report of its use for this purpose came in 1958 (JBJS 40 A: 511 - 525, 1958). The principle of the brace (cervicothoracic-lumbosacral orthosis, CTLSO) was to apply longitudinal correction between the pelvic girdle (originally made of leather and later thermoplastics) and the neck ring and lateral corrective forces applied to the curve apex via pads attached to a metal superstructure that connected the pelvic girdle to the neck ring. The brace was constructed to flatten the lumbar lordosis and in theory increase the effectiveness of the appropriately place pads. Correction was thought to occur by passive pad pressure on the apex (in the thoracic spine via pressure on the apical ribs) of the curves and actively by the muscles pulling away from the pads. The orthotic was used 23 hours a day and often combined with an exercise program. The main problem with the brace was adherence to treatment. Gradually the <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> gave way to underarm braces (TLSO's) which were thought to have better patient acceptance.

2500|$|Since {{scoliosis}} {{was discovered}} by Hippocrates, physicians and orthopedic surgeons have sought {{to find a cure}} for the condition. In the mid-twentieth century, modern medicine and treatment made it possible to decrease the progression of scoliosis within patients and alleviate the pain they experienced.

New ways were developed to treat scoliosis because the condition was increasingly understood among medical professionals and orthopedic surgeons. These treatments such as bracing and rod insertion into the spine were made possible at the turn of the twentieth century. During this time, many schools subjected their students to physical examinations and posture tests. It was believed that students suffered from negative effects such as poor posture due to hunching over desks for hours in the classroom. Although these screenings were not intended to detect spinal curvature, physicians diagnosed many students with scoliosis. Scoliosis was considered a disease-based condition during the mid-twentieth century caused by tuberculosis or poliomyelitis. These diseases responsible for causing spinal deformities were successfully managed throughout the 1960s due to the distribution of vaccines and antibiotics. Despite the successful management of diseases causing spinal deformity, many patients suffered from scoliosis with no known cause. The unknown cause was eventually determined to be idiopathic scoliosis. Alfred Shands Jr., an orthopedic surgeon, discovered that two percent of patients had non-disease related scoliosis. Idiopathic scoliosis, also known as the [...] "cancer of orthopedic surgery", was determined to be dangerous because there was no current treatment. The condition needed to be detected in patients promptly so treatment could be developed in time to halt its progression. As a result, schools made it mandatory for students to have screenings for scoliosis. Early on, set symptoms could be recognized among the students being tested from ages five to eighteen, but subsequent studies never confirmed them for this age-range. To begin the screenings, children would have their shoulder height, leg length and spinal curvature measurements taken while partially clothed. This was followed with the forward-bend test and bodily comparisons to wall charts that were printed reproductions of the ideal human posture. Unfortunately, these screenings were not always accurate and many students were misdiagnosed because poor posture could often be mistaken for scoliosis. One of the first treatments designed was the <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace,</b> a rigid contraption of metal rods attached to a plastic or leather girdle, designed to straighten the spine. As a result of the constant pressure the brace inflicted on a patients' spine, it was particularly painful and inconvenient to wear due to physical limits it imposed. Wearing the brace was known to cause jaw pain, skin irritation, muscle pain and low self-esteem among patients. The 'Harrington rod' technique was the second major treatment for scoliosis to emerge and became the first significant surgical procedure to manipulate spinal positioning. This treatment was initially developed to treat paralytic scoliosis that resulted from the polio epidemic of the 1950s. The <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> was the only nonoperative and noninvasive alternative to surgery at the time to provide postoperative correction to polio patients. A curve exceeding sixty degrees required the Harrington rod technique, otherwise the <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> was recommended. However, Canadian physician, Elizabeth Wyne, observed that fifty percent of patients wearing the <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> still required surgery later in life. Surgery may straighten the spine however it does not necessarily eradicate a patient of all the pain they suffer from due to scoliosis. Individuals who undergo surgery are left with scars and often have a lack of feeling in their backs to the invasive nature of this treatment. Despite the advancements of scoliosis treatments, yet to be determined is a cure that is reliable, risk-free and that results in few or no consequences for patients.|$|R

40|$|Twenty-seven {{children}} with progressive infantile idiopathic scoliosis have been reviewed after long-term management. Twenty-two children had single thoracic curves which were diagnosed {{at an early}} age and treated in a modified <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> until the age often years when the spine was corrected and fused. The mean correction after operation was 40 per cent ofthe initial degree ofcurvature seen in early childhood before treatment. Solid spinal fusion led to a further moderate loss in correction due to bending of the fusion mass before the spine became stable several years later. Five children had double structural curves and were treated only in a brace. This provided less satisfactory control ofthese curves but because of the minimal cosmetic deformity, extensive spinal fusion was avoided. Infantile idiopathic scoliosis is a structural curve appearing without evident cause in a child before the age of three years (James 1951). Although rare in North America it is not uncommon in Great Britain; in a series of 200 consecutive patients presenting with idiopathic scoliosis at the Edinburgh Scoliosis Clinic between 1968 and 1972, eighty-two were of the infantile variety...|$|R
50|$|Scoliosis, a {{condition}} describing an abnormal {{curvature of the}} spine, may in certain cases be treated with spinal orthoses, such as the <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace,</b> the Boston brace, and Charleston bending brace. As this condition develops most commonly in adolescent females who are undergoing their pubertal growth spurt, compliance with wearing is these orthoses is hampered by the concern these individuals have about changes in appearance and restriction caused by wearing these orthoses.Spinal orthoses may also {{be used in the}} treatment of spinal fractures. A Jewett brace, for instance, may be used to facilitate healing of an anterior wedge fracture involving the T10 to L3 vertebrae. A body jacket may be used to stabilize more involved fractures of the spine. The halo brace is a cervical thoracic orthosis used to immobilize the cervical spine, usually following fracture. The halo brace allows the least cervical motion of all cervical orthoses currently in use; it was first developed by Vernon L. Nickel at Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center in 1955.|$|R
50|$|Back braces {{are also}} {{commonly}} prescribed to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, {{as they may}} stop the progression of spinal curvature in a growing child/adolescent.

Other designs include the <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace,</b> the Charleston bending brace, the Peak Scoliosis Bracing System, and the SpineCor (a soft brace) in the United States, Canada and Europe.

Issues like patient compliance with treatment, psycho-social impact of brace use, and exercise with bracing have been looked at. Quality of Life research has been attempted, but is difficult due to a current lack of instruments. Bracing is the primary treatment for AIS in curves that are considered to be moderate in their severity and are likely due to progress (determined by curve pattern/type and the patient's structural maturity).|$|R

40|$|Although, {{the history}} of {{orthotic}} treatment for idiopathic scoliosis goes back more than fifty years, the mechanism of curve control by spinal orthosis is still controversial. Hypothetical explanations have been provided but few, if any, have been tested clinically. This study aims at the biornechanical evaluation of a spinal orthosis (<b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace)</b> {{in order to improve}} understanding about the mechanism of curves control in orthotic movement. From the results of the study, the change of the interface pressure between the patient's body and thoracic pad, and the tension of the thoracic strap were highly correlated (r = 0. 84) as patients performed different lying postures and daily activities. Lying on the thoracic pad is found to have the highest correctional force among different lying postures that may be favourable for preventing curve deterioration. The findings indicate that an increase in tension of the thoracic strap will increase the interface pressure on the thoracic pad and thus increase the resultant force exerted on the patient's body by the thoracic pad. Care must be taken as an excessive strap tension will increase discomfort and restrict body shifting exercises. The results also suggest that in scoliosis with thoracic lordosis, a short outrigger (small pulling angle of the thoracic strap) should be used as it will decrease the anteriorly directed force component so as to prevent exaggerating the thoracic lordosis...|$|R

Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of bracing on static and dynamic balance control of hyperkyphotic female adolescents. Study Design: Clinical trial. Methods: A force platform was employed to record center of pressure (COP) parameters. Ten adolescents undergoing <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> for hyperkyphosis and 14 normal subjects participated in the study. The COP data were collected with and without brace immediately on first day and after 120 days of continuous brace wear. Results: No significant difference was found in dynamic and static balance tests with and without brace on the first day (P > 0. 05). After 120 days, the values of COP displacement in functional reach to the right and left for the hyperkyphotic adolescents when performing without brace enhanced significantly compared to the first day. The forward reach distance was not significantly different between the normal and hyperkyphotic subjects (P = 0. 361); however, hyperkyphotic participants had significantly smaller reach distance in the functional reach to the right (21. 88 vs. 25. 56 cm) and left (17. 04 vs. 21. 25 cm).

MethodsOne hundred twenty outpatients with mild and moderate adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were randomly divided into a TCM group (TCMG) and a brace group (CG). TCMG patients underwent Daoyin, Tuina, and acupotomology therapies. CG patients were treated with a <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace.</b> Each patient's Cobb angle was measured after 12 and 24 months of treatment, and pulmonary function was determined after 12 months of treatment. Average electromyogram (AEMG) ratio of the surface electromyogram was measured after 6 and 12 months of treatment and followed-up after 18 and 24 months. ResultsThe Cobb angle significantly decreased in both groups after 12 months of treatment compared with before treatment (P 0. 05) after 12 months and 62. 5 % and 34. 7 % (P < 0. 05) after 24 months, respectively. Pulmonary function significantly improved after 12 months in TCMG (P < 0. 05) but significantly decreased in CG (P < 0. 05). The AEMG ratio was significantly lower (P < 0. 01) and tended to remain at 1 after stopping treatment in TCMG, but increased in CG (P < 0. 05).

However, by doing this way, we have to do two surgeries: the first one to lengthen the adductor tendons and the second one to lengthen the femur. If we prefer to do a one step surgery, it is crucial to add an intensive physiotherapy programme, because the progressive hip adduction contracture can easily lead to lateral dislocation of the hip. In order to avoid this complication, one can bridge the hip joint with the external fixator, but there is a neat way to avoid this procedure. Indeed, one can use a circular frame to do the femoral lengthening, and the solution is to use a proximal full ring in order to obtain a Milwaukee effect. This effect is based on the principle of spine auto-elongation with the <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> in scoliosis treatment. Thus, if a beginning of a hip adduction contracture occurs during the lengthening phase, the patient will have a perineal discomfort, and he will have to put his hip in abduction to avoid any contact between the proximal ring and the perineal zone. So, when the patient complaints about that, one can slow the distraction rate and intensify the physiotherapy programme. This procedure can be enough if it is done early, avoiding the likely tenotomy.|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} explore the {{long-term}} outcomes of back and neck pain and functionality in adult females with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), who had been treated with a <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace,</b> in a follow-up study a minimum of 23 years {{after the completion of}} the treatment, using radiological, clinical and socio-demographical data. Thirty AIS patients (scoliosis group-SG), were included in the study based on an extensive search of Pediatric Orthopedics and Traumatology Clinic charts. All treatments were successfully completed between 1974 and 1990. In all cases, scoliosis had not been detected before the age of 10 and was not combined with any major spinal deformities at the time when the brace treatment was implemented. In those patients, the Risser sign 4 and minimum two years post-menarche was defined as a maturity, after that time the brace treatment was completed. Patients were excluded from the study if they, {{at the time of the}} follow-up examinations, suffered from any other disease leading to trunk deformity. Forty patients met the criteria for inclusion, but due to change some personal details, not all of them were contacted. Finally, 30 women returned for a follow-up evaluation. Patients' follow-up period was mean 27. 77 yrs. ± SD 3. 30 (range 23 - 35). Curvature change from the end of the treatment until the present day was mean 9. 1 degrees ± SD 7. 64 (range 0 - 27). A control group of 42 healthy females (healthy controls group-HG) matching the age profile of the patient group was randomly selected for comparative purposes. Both SG and HG completed the Polish versions of the Revised Oswestry Lower Back Pain Disability Index (RODI), the Rolland-Morris Questionnaire (RMQ), the Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale (QDS), the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and the Copenhagen Neck Functional Disability Scale (CNFDS). Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographics and baseline questionnaire scores. To determine if the investigated sample sizes are equivalent, the chi-square test was used. The chi-square test was used to compare qualitative features between persons with scoliosis and healthy controls. In addition, a Mann-Whitney test was utilized to compare differences between both groups in regard to quantitative characteristics. To establish relations between quantitative data such as e. g. age, duration of brace application, apical translation, Cobb angle, and questionnaire results, we used Spearman's rank correlation (marked as rS). To determine dependency between quantitative and qualitative characteristics, e. g. between questionnaire numerical data and marital status, place of residence or curve type, ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test was used. A p< 0. 05 indicates statistical significance. Statistical calculations were performed by Statistica software. In regards to RODI, RMQ, QDS, NDI and CNFDS (both for total scores and particular sub-sections), statistically significant differences (p < 0. 001) between both samples were found, indicating higher levels of pain and neck and lower back pain-related disability among persons with scoliosis. Associations exist between RODI and RMQ (rS = 0. 76) QDS (rS = 0. 70), NDI (rS = 0. 69) and CNFDS (rS = 0. 60). RMQ was associated with QDS (rS = 0. 71) and NDI (rS = 0. 69), whereas QDS correlated with NDI (rS = 0. 80) and CNFDS (rS = 0. 60). NDI was also associated with CNFDS (rS = 0. 81). Persons with scoliosis treated in adolescence with a <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> display significant restrictions in everyday activities, due to lower back pain (LBP) and neck-related disabilities, compared to healthy controls. In addition, back pain is associated with curve progression in long-term follow-up after conservative treatment. Moreover, LBP-related disability coexists with restrictions experienced due to neck pain...|$|R
40|$|Objective 　To {{evaluate}} {{the influences of}} traditional Chinese medicinal combined therapies on pulmonary function and surface average electromyogram (AEMG) ratio in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients. Methods 　One hundred and twenty outpatients with mild and moderate adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were randomly divided into a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) group and a brace group. TCM group patients underwent i) Navigation of the spinal balance (twice a day, 40 min/ time), until to skeletal maturity; ii) Balance manipulation (twice a week, 25 min/time), lasted 12 months; iii) Small needle-knife therapy (once a week, 10 times). The brace group patients were treated with a <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace.</b> The Cobb angle was measured after 12 and 24 months of treatment, pulmonary function was determined after 12 months of treatment, and AEMG ratio of the surface electromyogram was measured 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after treatment, and intergroup comparison was performed. Results 　The Cobb angle significantly decreased in both groups 12 months after treatment (P 0. 05) in the TCM group and brace group, respectively, 12 months after treatment and 62. 5 % and 34. 7 % (P< 0. 05), respectively, 24 months aftertreatment. Pulmonary function was significantly improved 12 months after treatment in TCM group (P< 0. 05) but significantly decreased in brace group (P< 0. 05). The AEMG ratio was significantly reduced (P< 0. 01) and tended to remain at 1 after stopping treatment in TCM group, showed that the muscle imbalance existed {{on both sides of}} the scoliosis, but was adverse in brace group (P< 0. 05), showed that the muscle imbalance aggravated. No side effect of the therapeutic method was found. Conclusions 　The spinal balance therapy based on traditional Chinese medicine theory has excellent therapeutic efficacy and safety, and can significantly ameliorate the imbalance existed {{on both sides of the}} scoliosis, improve lung function index, and have better compliance. The AEMG ratio is a new strategy that could replace radiography in evaluation of therapeutic efficacy and progression in scoliosis, thus avoiding the repeated X-ray exposure to the body.

40|$|In {{recent reports}} 4 'Â°, the {{association}} ofeongenital fusion of the cervical vertebrae with symptoms of nadicuhopathy or myelopathy {{led to the}} idea that the pathogenesis of the neurological deficit is either the spondylosis or the hyper mobility, or both, of the segments adjacent to the fusion. The risk of neuropathy is higher, especially when an un derlying congenital stenosis of the cervical spine is present. We are reporting a case of severe developmental cervical stenosis in a young woman with congenital cervical fusion, to emphasize the importance of recognizing the coexistence of these anomalies. Case Report In November 1982, a twenty-three-year-old white woman first noted the abrupt onset of mid-thoracic pain radiating to both lower extremities. She also had discomfort in both shoulders. Between the ages of seven and fifteen, she had been treated with a <b>Milwaukee</b> <b>brace</b> for a congenital thoracolumbar scoliosis (30 degrees) (Fig. I), which had stabilized and remained unchanged. Prior to the onset of the pain in the back she had no pain in the neck or back, but she had had limitation of motion in the neck since birth. Although she had been told that a vertebral anomaly existed in the cervical and thoracic spine. no mention ofthe Klippel-FeiI syndrome had been made. and no neurological defect had ever been noted. On examination, the neck was shortened and the hairline was low. The motion of the neck was limited to 20 degrees of extension and 40 degrees of flexion. Rotation in either direction was limited by approxi mately 50 per cent. The motor, sensory. and reflex examinations were within normal limits. The muscle bulk in the right lower limb was somewhat diminished as compared with the left, and the right foot was also slightly smaller than the left one. The patient was treated with a soft cervical collar, local heat, bed rest, and anti-inflammatory medications. She had moderate relief of the symptoms. In January 1983. she continued to have pain in the back. and severe pain developed in the right shoulder and right part of the neck. The pain radiated into the right index, long. and ring fingers. The motor and sensory functions were within normal limits, but the right triceps reflex was di minished as compared with the left. With rest, use of a soft collar. an...|$|R
