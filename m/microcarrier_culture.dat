However, to date, there are limited studies examining the effects of changing between adherent, suspension, and microcarrier cultures on glycosylation of the recombinant product (Nam et al. 2008). Furthermore, the few studies performed typically compare <b>microcarrier</b> <b>culture</b> to culture in suspension (Hooker et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2002; Watson et al. 1994), and not to the normal adherent cell culture conditions, and have shown results that seem to be specific to the type of cell, product, and microcarrier used. For example, increased sialylation was found in Cytodex culture for recombinant human tissue kallikrein production (Watson et al. 1994) and in Cytoline culture of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in a fluidized bed bioreactor for interferon-γ production (Hooker et al. 2007), while no differences were found in human recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) produced by CHO cells in fluidized bed bioreactor cultures with Cytoline (Wang et al. 2002).|$|E

Analysis of cell morphology on <b>microcarriers</b> and <b>culture</b> plates at different time points (D 0, D 3, D 10, D 14) during cell culture were performed using scanning electron microscopy and bright field microscopy.

Animal cells take in amphipathic glycosides, which are later glycosylated after assimilation in biosynthetic pathways. Gycosylated glycosides are released outside of cells to the surrounding culture medium. This represents an accessible method of obtaining complex glycosides. Results Vero cells are sensitive to Shiga toxins and are known to express the glycosides globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb 3) and globotetraosyl ceramide (Gb 4) {{on the surface of the}} plasma membrane. By administering amphipathic lactosides to Vero cells, the above mentioned glycolipids could be produced by the action of cellular enzymes. In our study, the optimum conditions (seeded cell number, incubated time period, 12 -azidododecyl lactoside concentration and medium volume) for the production of Gb 3 analogue were investigated. The 87. 9 μg/ 100 mm dish (11. 7 % yield) Gb 3 analogue was produced under appropriate conditions. The large-scale culture of Vero cells using a <b>microcarrier</b> <b>culture</b> method with repetitions produced about 30 mg of the Gb 3 analogue.

However, the development of processes for large-scale generation of human ESCs (hESCs) or their progeny will be necessary before hESC-based therapies become a reality. We hypothesized that microcarrier stirred-suspension bioreactors characterized by scalability, straightforward operation, and tight control of the culture environment can be used for hESC culture and directed differentiation. Under appropriate conditions, the concentration of hESCs cultured in a microcarrier bioreactor increased 34 - to 45 -fold over 8 days. The cells retained the expression of pluripotency markers such as OCT 3 / 4 A, NANOG, and SSEA 4, as assessed by quantitative PCR, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. We further hypothesized that hESCs on microcarriers can be induced to definitive endoderm (DE) when incubated with physiologically relevant factors. In contrast to embryoid body cultures, all hESCs on microcarriers are exposed to soluble stimuli in the bulk medium facilitating efficient transition to DE. After reaching a peak concentration, hESCs in <b>microcarrier</b> <b>cultures</b> were incubated in medium containing activin A, Wnt 3 a, and low concentration of serum.

In a single passage, keratinocytes multiplied 44. 9 -fold in microcarrier-bioreactor culture in 17 days, whereas two-dimensional cultures reached confluence in 9 days and only expanded 7. 4 -fold. Histological characterization of keratinocytes on the microcarriers revealed that the cells were randomly distributed within these porous structures, however, not all pores contained cells.

Well-known in vaccine production, <b>microcarrier</b> <b>culture</b> also has potential for application in other fields. In this work, two types of microcarriers were evaluated for small-scale monoclonal antibody (mAb) production by CHO-K 1 cells. Cultures (5 mL) of microporous Cytodex 3 and macroporous CultiSpher-S carriers were performed in vented conical tubes and subsequently scaled-up (20 mL) to shake-flasks, testing combinations of different culture conditions (cell concentration, microcarrier concentration, rocking methodology, rocking speed and initial culture volume). Culture performance was evaluated considering mAb production and cell growth at the phases of initial adhesion and proliferation. The best culture performances were obtained with Cytodex 3, regarding cell proliferation (average 1. 85 ± 0. 11 x 106 cells/mL against 0. 60 ± 0. 08 x 106 cells/mL for CultiSpher-S), mAb production (2. 04 ± 0. 41 µg/mL against 0. 99 ± 0. 35 µg/mL for CultiSpher-S) and culture longevity (30 days against 10 - 15 days for CultiSpher-S), probably due to the collagen-coated dextran matrix that potentiates adhesion and prevents detachment. The culture conditions of greater influence were rocking mechanism (Cytodex 3, pulse followed by continuous) and initial cell concentration (CultiSpher-S, 4 x 105 cells/mL). Microcarriers proved to be a viable and favorable alternative to standard adherent and suspended cultures for mAb production by CHO-K 1 cells, with simple operation, easy scale-up and significantly higher levels of mAb production.

Perfusion led to 20 % higher cell densities in the standard process with 2 g·L- 1 microcarrier {{in comparison to the}} "repeated batch" process. An increase in microcarrier concentration to 5 g·L- 1 resulted in high cell densities of > 5. 0 · 106 cells·mL- 1 for over three to four days cultivation time. The use of perfusion for virus propagation resulted in high virus titers (107. 5 TCID 50 ·mL- 1) in the bioreactor and a titer of 105. 7 TCID 50 ·mL- 1 in the harvest pool, which exceeds the necessary amount for vaccine production. The results of this work show that perfusion strategies are suitable to simplify and improve this production technology significantly. Now, the whole process can be operated as a closed system, thus fulfilling GMP-requirements in an ideal manner...|$|E
30|$|In a more {{specific}} analysis, the different conditions evaluated for the <b>microcarrier</b> <b>cultures</b> were considered. Rocking speed influences the mAb glycosylation profile, but this effect is highly dependent on the rocking methodology. For example, when using pulse/continuous rocking methodology, 60 [*]rpm enables the production of mAbs {{with lower levels of}} sialylation (reduced S 2 structures) compared to 40 [*]rpm (CY 1 versus CY 3), which are potentially more effective through ADCC. However, using a continuous rocking (CY 2 versus CY 4), these observations are reversed, and 40 [*]rpm (CY 4) appears as the advantageous rocking speed. There seems to be no correlation between these results and the cell concentrations and productivities achieved in these assays (Table[*] 2). Nevertheless, the combination of rocking speed and mechanism should be considered for mAb quality.|$|R
40|$|The first space {{bioreactor}} {{has been}} designed for microprocessor control, no gaseous headspace, circulation and resupply of culture medium, and a slow mixing in very low shear regimes. Various ground based bioreactors {{are being used to}} test reactor vessel design, on-line sensors, effects of shear, nutrient supply, and waste removal from continuous culture of human cells attached to microcarriers. The small (500 ml) bioreactor is being constructed for flight experiments in the Shuttle middeck to verify systems operation under microgravity conditions and to measure the efficiencies of mass transport, gas transfer, oxygen consumption, and control of low shear stress on cells. Applications of <b>microcarrier</b> <b>cultures,</b> development of the first space bioreactor flight system, shear and mixing effects on cells, process control, and methods to monitor cell metabolism and nutrient requirements are among the topics covered...|$|R
40|$|Influenza virus A/PR/ 8 / 34 virus {{propagation}} in adherent Madin-Darby canine kidney {{cells in}} high-density <b>microcarrier</b> <b>cultures</b> is described. To improve virus yields perfusion and repeated fed-batch modes were applied using cell-specific feed rates. Cell densities up to 1. 1 x 107 cells/mL were achieved. Cell-specific virus yields in high-density cultures were at similar level compared to standard, low-density cultivations. In the average 2400 and 3300 virions per cell {{were obtained for}} two variants of the virus strain A/PR/ 8 / 34, PR 8 -NIBSC and PR 8 -RKI, respectively. Maximum virus titer (HA-activity = 1778 HAU/ 100 μL) for virus variant PR 8 -NIBSC was obtained for a cultivation infected before maximum cell concentration was reached.
