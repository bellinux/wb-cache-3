5|$|In the Aegean Sea, Greece has {{allocated}} a {{large area}} {{for the preservation of}} the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> and its habitat. The Greek Alonissos Marine Park, that extends around the Northern Sporades islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation. MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the monk seal preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another monk seal breeding site as a national park, and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme. The legislation in Greece is very strict towards seal hunting, and in general, the public is very much aware and supportive of the effort for the preservation of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of {{the largest}} groups among the {{foundations}} concentrating their efforts towards {{the preservation of the}} <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> is the Mediterranean Seal Research Group (Akdeniz Foklarını Araştırma Grubu) operating under the Underwater Research Foundation (Sualtı Araştırmaları Derneği) in Turkey (also known as SAD-AFAG). The group has taken initiative in joint preservation efforts together with the Foça municipal officials, as well as phone, fax, and email hotlines for sightings.|$|E

5|$|The museum's {{permanent}} display encompasses mineralogical and petrographical collections, {{as well as}} {{a collection}} of animals, the bulk of which dates back to the 19th century. The zoological collection is {{on the second floor of}} the museum. It includes the skeleton of a <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal,</b> a basking shark native to the Adriatic Sea and an Atlantic puffin, a bird today native to the Arctic area, which is believed to have nested in the Adriatic in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|All species {{experienced}} over-hunting by sealers. The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} experienced population drops in the 19th century and during World War II, and the Caribbean monk seal was exploited since the 1500s until the 1850s, when populations were {{too low to}} hunt commercially. The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> has experienced commercial hunting since the Middle Ages and eradication by fishermen. Monk seals have developed a fear of humans, and may even abandon beaches due to human presence. There are currently around 1,700 monk seals in total.|$|E
5|$|Monk seals are {{earless seals}} {{of the tribe}} Monachini. They are the only earless seals found in {{tropical}} climates. There are two genera of monk seals, Monachus and Neomonachus, comprising three species: the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal,</b> Monachus monachus; the Hawaiian monk seal, Neomonachus schauinslandi; and the Caribbean monk seal, Neomonachus tropicalis, which became extinct in the 20th century. The two surviving species are now rare and in imminent danger of extinction. All three monk seal species were classified in genus Monachus until 2014, when the Caribbean and Hawaiian species were placed into a new genus, Neomonachus.|$|E

5|$|The meat, blubber and fur {{coats of}} {{pinnipeds}} {{have traditionally been}} used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for their products, seals and walruses are now protected by international law. The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct in the past century, while the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, and conflicts with local people.|$|E
5|$|Commercial sealing was {{historically}} just {{as important}} an industry as whaling. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal. The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced {{the length of the}} hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and only remains in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{habitat of}} the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> {{has changed over}} the years. Prior to the 20th century, Mediterranean monk seals had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. Since sealing had ended, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for such behavior. More often than not, these caves are rather {{inaccessible}} to humans due to underwater entries, and because the caves are often along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans and the destruction of the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.|$|E

500|$|Monk seals are {{earless seals}} (true seals) {{of the tribe}} Monachini. The tribe was first {{conceived}} by Victor Blanchard Scheffer in his 1958 book Seals, Sea Lions, and Walruses: A Review of the Pinnipedia. There are two genera of monk seals, Monachus and Neomonachus, comprising three species: the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> (Monachus monachus), the Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi), and the Caribbean monk seal (Neomonachus tropicalis), which became extinct in the 20th century. All three monk seal species were classified in genus Monachus until 2014, when comparison of the species' mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA sequences led biologists to place the Caribbean and Hawaiian species in a new genus, Neomonachus.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> has a short, broad, {{and flat}} snout, with very pronounced, long {{nostrils}} that face upwards. The flippers are relatively short, with small slender claws. The monk seal’s physique is ideally suited for hunting its prey: fish, octopus, lobster, and squid {{in deep water}} coral beds. The fur coats of males is generally black, and brown or dark gray in females. Pups are about [...] long and weigh around , their skin being covered by [...] fur, usually dark brown or black. On their bellies, there is a white stripe, which differs in color between the two sexes. This hair is replaced after {{six to eight weeks}} by the usual short hair adults carry.|$|E
50|$|Cabo Blanco, in the Atlantic Ocean, is {{the only}} place in the world where <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> form a true colony. In 1997, two-thirds of the colony died off, but there has been gradual {{recovery}} since.|$|R

50|$|As {{there are}} {{indications}} of small population increases in the subpopulations, as of 2015, the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal's</b> IUCN conservation status has been updated from critically endangered to endangered {{in keeping with the}} IUCN's speed-of-decline criteria, with a recommendation for re-assessment in 2020.|$|R
2500|$|Marine mammals {{include the}} large {{varieties}} of cetaceans including rare and not well-known species (see more {{details in the}} Marine life of the Canary Islands).

2500|$|The Northern Sporades {{are one of}} {{the prime}} {{breeding}} areas of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> (Monachus monachus) an endangered species. The main threat to Monachus monachus is man and his activities. Often deliberately killed or accidentally caught in fishing equipment, its food sources are declining also. In addition, marine pollution and uncontrolled tourism are causing the destruction of The seal's natural habitat. The establishment in 1992 of the National Marine Park of Alonnissos-Northern Sporades was an effort to protect this species by restricting human encroachment on seal breeding areas. Wild land mammals include pine martens (Martes martes), brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) and mice, the southern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), bats and, though declining in numbers, European hares. A mating pair of fallow deer (Dama dama) have been privately reintroduced to the island. [...] A population of feral cats exists in and around areas of human habitation.|$|E
2500|$|Harp seal {{populations in}} the {{northwest}} Atlantic declined to approximately 2 million in the late 1960s {{as a result of}} Canada's annual kill rates, which averaged to over 291,000 from 1952 to 1970. Conservationists demanded reduced rates of killing and stronger regulations to avert the extinction of the harp seal. An endangered seal is the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal.</b> In 1971, the Canadian government responded by instituting a quota system. The system was competitive, with each boat catching as many seals as it could before the hunt closed, which the Department of Fisheries and Oceans did when they knew that year's quota had been reached. Because it was thought that the competitive element might cause sealers to cut corners, new regulations were introduced that limited the catch to 400 seals per day, and 2000 per boat total. A 2007 population survey conducted by the DFO estimated the population at 5.5 million.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal's</b> reproduction. It is {{suggested}} that they are polygynous, with males being very territorial where they mate with females. Although there is no breeding season since births take place year round, there is a peak in October and November. This is also the time when caves are prone to wash out due to high surf or storm surge, which causes high mortality rates among <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> pups, especially at the key Cabo Blanco colony. Pups make first contact with the water two weeks after their birth and are weaned at around 18 weeks of age; females caring for pups will go off to feed {{for an average of}} nine hours. Most individuals are believed to reach maturity at four years of age. The gestation period lasts close to a year. However, it is believed to be common among <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> of the Cabo Blanco colony to have a gestation period lasting slightly longer than a year. <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> generally live to be 25 to 30 years old.|$|R
50|$|A tiny {{colony of}} <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> inhabit the beaches, and since 1990 the islands have been {{constituted}} as a nature reserve for their protection.
