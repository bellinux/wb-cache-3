40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) has {{developed}} a test procedure to compare the initiating strength <b>of</b> <b>detonators</b> by using adjustable-sensitivity liquid explosives. Various tests <b>of</b> <b>detonator</b> strength are currently used by the industry, {{but many of them}} do not quantify the ability <b>of</b> <b>detonators</b> to initiate detonation reactions in an explosive charge. The USBM used mixtures of nitromethane and ethylene diamine, the sensitivity being 'fine-tuned' by 2 -nitropropane. Military standard J- 2, commercial No. 6, and commercial No. 8 detonators were evaluated using three test configurations: (1) axially immersed in the test explosive, (2) tip just touching surface of the explosive, and (3) immersed transversely in the explosive.

50|$|The Swan device has one-point safety {{designed}} {{into its}} structure.

When only one <b>of</b> the two <b>detonators</b> <b>of</b> a Swan device is ignited, the core is imploded into two parts, neither of which achieves criticality.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} have been made to explain the link between altered brain function and schizophrenia. One of the most common is the dopamine hypothesis, which attributes psychosis to the mind's faulty interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>misfiring</b> <b>of</b> dopaminergic neurons.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear part}} <b>of</b> a <b>detonator</b> is usually {{made of a}} rigid but {{malleable}} aluminium alloy, sometimes supported by a relatively soft brass or copper structure to aid in reliably giving a strong and watertight seal without damaging the initiation source. A pair <b>of</b> <b>detonator</b> crimping pliers mate the detonator with the initiation source by allowing the detonator's back end to be inserted into the large hole present when the pliers is in the non-compressed position. When force is applied, the jaws will move closer to each other crimping the neck <b>of</b> the <b>detonator.</b> This shows that the function is just a simple crimping tool, adapted for one specific item.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper studied <b>misfire</b> {{diagnosis}} <b>of</b> {{diesel engine}} based on short-time vibration characters. <b>Misfire</b> <b>of</b> diesel engine was simulated by the vibration monitoring test. Cylinder vibration signal and top center signal were collected under different states. The short-time vibration signal of each cylinder was intercepted {{according to the}} diesel combustion sequence, effective value was calculated, and BP Neural Network model built with this character was used to diagnose diesel misfire. The result shows that this method can locate the misfire cylinder effectively, and it is meaningful for guiding the detection and repair of vehicles...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of a}} new {{materials}} effort, we are exploring the use of sol- gel chemistry to manufacture energetic materials. Traditional manufacturing of energetic materials involves processing of granular solids. One application is the production <b>of</b> <b>detonators</b> where powders <b>of</b> energetic material and a binder are typically mixed and compacted at high pressure to make pellets. Performance properties are strongly dependent on particle size distribution, surface area of its constituents, homogeneity of the mix, and void volume. The goal is to produce detonators with fast energy release rate the are insensitive to unintended initiation. In this paper, we report results of our early work in this field of research, including the preparation <b>of</b> <b>detonators</b> from xerogel molding powders and aerogels, comparing the material properties with present state-of-the-art technology...|$|R

5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} and testing <b>of</b> the critical <b>detonators</b> was shared between Lauritsen's group at Caltech and Robert Henderson's group at Los Alamos. By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 detonators each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box <b>of</b> <b>detonators</b> manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order.|$|R
50|$|Each type <b>of</b> <b>detonators</b> have an instruction/information folder {{written by}} the {{manufacturer}} or the distributor. In it are clear {{instructions on how to}} crimp that specific type/model. Most detonators contain relatively sensitive explosive compound meant to initiate the staged detonation train. Crimping a detonator in the wrong place or with improper tools may cause it to detonate.|$|R
50|$|It {{is rarely}} used alone, but {{primarily}} used in booster and bursting charges of small caliber ammunition, in upper charges <b>of</b> <b>detonators</b> in some land mines and shells, {{and as the}} explosive core of detonation cord.

50|$|A unique {{mechanical}} set-back {{safety on}} the base <b>of</b> the <b>detonator</b> grounds the circuit until the missile has accelerated out of the tube.

50|$|Ordinary {{detonators}} {{usually take}} the form of ignition-based explosives. Whilst they are mainly used in commercial operations, ordinary detonators are still used in military operations. This form <b>of</b> <b>detonator</b> is most commonly initiated using safety fuse, and used in non time-critical detonations e.g. conventional munitions disposal. Well known detonators are lead azide, Pb(N3)2, silver azide (AgN3) and mercury fulminate Hg(ONC)2.|$|R
