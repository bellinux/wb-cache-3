5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans <b>must</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one that is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E
500|$|After Bundy's execution, Ann Rule was {{surprised}} and troubled to hear from numerous [...] "sensitive, intelligent, kind young women", who wrote or called {{to say they were}} deeply depressed because Bundy was dead.

[...] "Even in death, Ted damaged women," [...] Rule wrote. [...] "To get well, they <b>must</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> they were conned by the master conman.

We have been repeatedly telling the current government that instead of engaging the terrorists in dialogue, government should act against these elements. Karachi {{has a number of}} terrorists and it might suffer from a blow back; this should be tackled so Karachi does not have to suffer on account of this." [...] MQM head Altaf Hussain said, [...] "I welcome this operation and I am glad that government is supporting the armed forces, those who have not backed the operation <b>must</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> {{it is a matter of}} national security. I appeal to them to come on same page by setting aside their political compulsions." [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|Lennon stated: [...] "'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine {{that there}} was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is {{virtually}} the Communist manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement." [...] He told NME: [...] "There is no real Communist state in the world; you <b>must</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that.</b> The Socialism I speak about ... not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice ... British Socialism." [...] Ono described the lyrical statement of [...] "Imagine" [...] as [...] "just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people." [...] Rolling Stone described its lyrics as [...] "22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself". Some observers have described the song has having a distinctly anti-religious viewpoint, to the point that some have embraced it as an [...] "atheist anthem".|$|E

2500|$|Comparing {{themselves}} to the reporters who uncovered the Watergate scandal, the authors maintain that only through speculative [...] "synthesis can one discern the underlying continuity, the unified and coherent fabric, which lies {{at the core of}} any historical problem."

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{generalized}} impressions sometimes advanced about the decline and decrease of the Gymnosperms through the enormous {{development of the}} Angiosperms in the Cretaceous and their rapidly accelerated development in the Tertiary, it <b>must</b> be <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> this impression is confusing as far as Coniferales are concerned. It is of course a truism that the Gymnosperms are completely outnumbered in genera and species by the Angiosperms, the latter occupying terrain earlier beset by Gymnosperms. It <b>must</b> be <b>realized,</b> however, <b>that</b> possibly the almost entirely woody Gymnosperms did never {{have the potential for}} producing such immense numbers of genera and species as now found among the Angiosperms. This statement is also valid for the Coniferales...|$|R
2500|$|If {{the ensuing}} years did bring regrets to Melville's life, it is {{impossible}} to believe he would have regretted marrying Elizabeth.

2500|$|Germany, {{which is}} {{involved}} in the UN-mandated International Security Assistance force in Afghanistan and also heads an international effort improving Afghanistan's police force, has suggested that Afghanistan could potentially lose aid or technical support for reconstruction efforts depending on the outcome of Abdul Rahman's case. German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble has stated [...] "I highly support the idea that we make it clear to Afghanistan, in every way possible, that abiding by and protecting human rights, which Afghanistan is obliged to, includes [...] freedom of religion." [...] Schäuble also said, [...] "We contribute a lot to rebuilding Afghanistan and towards its stability, so I truly believe that Afghanistan <b>must</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> we insist upon the freedom of religion.

2500|$|Arar {{settlement}} in Canada does not close the book. It only opens {{a new chapter}} of a book that {{is about more than}} Maher Arar — it is about the erosion of civil and human rights in Canada {{as a result of the}} [...] "War on Terror." [...] The Arar saga brought into focus the unintended victims of draconian laws and policies hastily enacted post 9/11 in Canada and south of the border. It also shed light on the potential of religious and racial profiling inherent in such laws and practices. We can only hope that Arar's second wish which was to [...] "make sure this does not happen to any other Canadian citizens in the future," [...] will also come true. For this to happen, however, more people <b>must</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> due process and fundamental rights must be respected at all times and more so during times of real or perceived crisis when society has a tendency to overreact.|$|E

"the patient's facial {{appearance}} may {{be described}} thus: the nose sharp, the eyes sunken, the temples fallen in, the ears cold and drawn in and their lobes distorted, {{the skin of}} the face hard, stretched and dry, and the colour of the face pale or dusky.… and if there is no improvement within prescribed period of time, it <b>must</b> be <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> this sign portends death." ...|$|R
2500|$|In late February 1938, the {{garrison}} {{commander of the}} Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China released a list of regulations and inducements to encourage foreigners {{to return to the}} Hongkou District to live, shop or do business: [...] "Foreigners returning to districts North of the Creek are especially requested to respect the sentry on point duty at the Garden Bridge and at street corners by giving him a gentle bow, and wishing him 'GOOD MORNING.' Foreigners <b>must</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese soldier doing such duty represents the EMPEROR OF JAPAN." [...] In June 1938 an American physician Dr J.C. Thompson was slapped by Japanese sentries on the Garden Bridge. In early July 1938 bombs were thrown at a Japanese sentry post on the Garden Bridge as part of a co-ordinated attack by Chinese resistance fighters on Japanese businesses. From 20 July 1938, the bridge was again referred to as [...] "The Bridge of Sighs", as a result of handing Jiang Haisheng, a nineteen-year-old student who had been apprehended with a grenade in the International Settlement, to Japanese military authorities at the Garden Bridge. Later that month Miss Dorothea Lintihac was [...] "rough housed" [...] by Japanese sentries because she and her mother crossed the Garden Bridge {{on the wrong side of}} the street to avoid both dangerous traffic and barbwire entanglements. Subsequently, they were arrested and detained later. The British Consul General Herbert Phillips protested the incident and the [...] "increasingly belligerent attitude" [...] of the Japanese sentries.|$|E

5000|$|... (2) The {{development}} of the relative and equivalent forms of value: their interdependence. Here Marx writes about the interrelatedness of the relative form and the equivalent form. He first explains {{that there is a}} correlation between them even though they are polar opposites.

60|$|Hearing {{the beat}} of hoofs behind him, he looked over his {{shoulder}} to see four other troopers closing rapidly down upon him. Clearly he was the object of their attention.

2500|$|However, Piave {{was not at}} all {{pleased by}} this turn of events and felt that an opera based on Hernani could not be staged for reasons of censorship.

Thus he overhears much of the interaction between Elvira and Ernani before finally revealing himself. Verdi <b>must</b> have <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> no king [...] "would ever be allowed to hide in a cupboard", something which Budden notes.|$|R
