40|$|Reliable and {{accurate}} material identification {{is a crucial}} component underlying higher-level autonomous tasks {{within the context of}} autonomous mining. Such tasks can include exploration, reconnaissance and guidance of machines (e. g. autonomous diggers and haul trucks) to mine sites. This thesis focuses on the problem of classification of materials (rocks and minerals) using high spatial and high spectral resolution (hyperspectral) imagery, collected remotely from <b>mine</b> <b>faces</b> in operational open pit mines. A new method is developed for the classification of hyperspectral data including field spectra and imagery using a probabilistic framework and Gaussian Process regression. The developed method uses, for the first time, the Observation Angle Dependent (OAD) covariance function to classify high-dimensional sets of data. The performance of the proposed method of classification is assessed and compared to standard methods used for the classification of hyperspectral data. This is done using a staged experimental framework. First, the proposed method is tested using high-resolution field spectrometer data acquired in the laboratory and in the field. Second, the method is extended to work on hyperspectral imagery acquired in the laboratory and its performance evaluated. Finally, the method is evaluated for imagery acquired from a <b>mine</b> <b>face</b> under natural illumination and the use of independent spectral libraries to classify imagery is explored. A probabilistic framework was selected because it best enables the integration of internal and external information from a variety of sensors. To demonstrate advantages of the proposed GP-OAD method over existing, deterministic methods, a new framework is proposed to fuse hyperspectral images using the classified probabilistic outputs from several different images acquired of the same <b>mine</b> <b>face.</b> This method maximises the amount of information but reduces the amount of data by condensing all available information into a single map. Thus, the proposed fusion framework removes the need to manually select a single classification among many individual classifications of a <b>mine</b> <b>face</b> as the `best' one and increases the classification performance by combining more information. The methods proposed in this thesis are steps forward towards an automated <b>mine</b> <b>face</b> inspection system that can be used within the existing autonomous mining framework to improve productivity and efficiency. Last but not least the proposed methods will also contribute to increased mine safety...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Hyperspectral data {{acquired}} from field-based plat-forms present new challenges for their analysis, particularly for complex vertical surfaces exposed to large {{changes in the}} geometry and intensity of illumination. The use of hyperspectral data to map rock types on a vertical <b>mine</b> <b>face</b> is demonstrated, {{with a view to}} providing real-time information for automated mining applications. The performance of two classification techniques, namely, spectral angle mapper (SAM) and support vector ma-chines (SVMs), is compared rigorously using a spectral library acquired under various conditions of illumination. SAM and SVM are then applied to a <b>mine</b> <b>face,</b> and results are compared with geological boundaries mapped in the field. Effects of changing conditions of illumination, including shadow, were investigated by applying SAM and SVM to imagery acquired at different times of the day. As expected, classification of the spectral libraries showed that, on average, SVM gave superior results for SAM, although SAM performed better where spectra were acquired under con-ditions of shadow. In contrast, when applied to hypserspectral imagery of a <b>mine</b> <b>face,</b> SVM did not perform as well as SAM. Shadow, through its impact upon spectral curve shape and albedo, {{had a profound impact on}} classification using SAM and SVM.

5000|$|In industry, crushers are {{machines}} {{which use}} a metal surface to break or compress materials into small fractional chunks or denser masses. Throughout most of industrial history, {{the greater part}} of crushing and mining part of the process occurred under muscle power as the application of force concentrated in the tip of the miners pick or sledge hammer driven drill bit. Before explosives came into widespread use in bulk mining in the mid-nineteenth century, most initial ore crushing and sizing was by hand and hammers at the mine or by water powered trip hammers in the small charcoal fired smithies and iron works typical of the Renaissance through the early-to-middle industrial revolution. It was only after explosives, and later early powerful steam shovels produced large chunks of materials, chunks originally reduced by hammering in the mine before being loaded into sacks for a trip to the surface, chunks that were eventually also to lead to rails and mine railways transporting bulk aggregations that post-mine face crushing became widely necessary. The earliest of these were in the foundries, but as coal took hold the larger operations became the coal breakers that fueled industrial growth from {{the first decade of the}} 1600s to the replacement of breakers in the 1970s through the fuel needs of the present day. The gradual coming of that era and displacement of the cottage industry based economies was itself accelerated first by the utility of wrought and cast iron as a desired materials giving impetus to larger operations, then in the late-sixteenth century by the increasing scarcity of wood lands for charcoal production to make the newfangled window glass material that had become - along with the chimney - [...] 'all the rage' [...] among the growing middle-class and affluence of the sixteenth-and-seventeenth centuries;and as always, the charcoal needed to smelt metals, especially to produce ever larger amounts of brass and bronze, pig iron, cast iron and wrought iron demanded by the new consumer classes. Other metallurgical developments such as silver and gold mining mirrored the practices and developments of the bulk material handling methods and technologies feeding the burgeoning appetite for more and more iron and glass, both of which were rare in personal possessions until the 1700s. [...] Things only became worse when the English figured out how to cast the more economical iron cannons (1547), following on their feat of becoming the armorers of the European continent's powers by having been leading producers brass and bronze guns, and eventually by various acts of Parliament, gradually banned or restricted the further cutting of trees for charcoal in larger and larger regions in the United Kingdom. In 1611, a consortium led by courtier Edward Zouch was granted a patent for the reverberatory furnace, a furnace using coal, not precious national timber reserves, which was immediately employed in glass making. An early politically connected and wealthy Robber Baron figure Sir Robert Mansell bought his way into the fledgling furnace company wrested control of it, and by 1615 managed to have James I issued a proclamation forbidding the use of wood to produce glass, giving his families extensive coal holdings a monopoly on both source and means of production for nearly half-a-century. Abraham Darby a century later relocated to Bristol where he had established a building brass and bronze industry by importing Dutch workers and using them to raid Dutch techniques. Both materials were considered superior to iron for cannon, and machines as they were better understood. But Darby would change the world in several key ways. Where the Dutch had failed in casting iron, one of Darby's apprentices, John Thomas succeeded in 1707 and as Burke put it: [...] "had given England the key to the Industrial Revolution". At the time, mines and foundries were virtually all small enterprises except for the tin mines (driven by the price and utility of brass) and materials came out of the mines already hammered small by legions of miners who had to stuff their work into carry sacks for pack animal slinging. Concurrently, mines needed drained resulting in Savery and Newcomen's early steam driven pumping systems. The deeper the mines went, the larger the demand became for better pumps, the greater the demand for iron, the greater the need for coal, the greater the demand for each. Seeing ahead clearly, Darby, sold off his brass business interests and relocated to Coalbrookdale with its plentiful coal mines, water power and nearby ore supplies. Over that decade his foundries developed iron casting technologies and began to supplant other metals in many applications. He adapted Coking of his fuel by copying Brewers practices. In 1822 the pumping industries needs for larger cylinders met up with Darby's ability to melt sufficient quantities of pig iron to cast large inexpensive iron cylinders instead of costly brass ones, reducing the cost of cylinders by nine-tenths.
