5|$|A Marvel One-Shot {{featuring}} Peggy Carter was in {{the works}} for some time before Atwell signed on to star in it, reprising her role from the Captain America films. D'Esposito, co-president of Marvel Studios and an executive producer on the feature films, aimed to replicate the period setting of Captain America: The First Avenger, while also giving the short a more modern, superhero feel. The film was a more ambitious production than previous One-Shots, with <b>more</b> <b>action</b> scenes and visual effects required than previously. Several other characters from Marvel Cinematic Universe films also appear, including Cooper reprising his role of Howard Stark.|$|E

Lightsaber combat was {{a challenge to the}} 60-year-old actor, who, like his costars, took fencing lessons. The close-up shots and non-acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid. Advanced fencing and acrobatic stunts were executed by McDiarmid's doubles, Michael Byrne, Sebastian Dickins, and Bob Bowles.|$|E

By September 1917, as reinforcements from New Zealand continued to arrive on the Western Front to replace the casualties lost in the major battles of the previous two years, Allen, still the Minister of Defence, was concerned by the drain on New Zealand's manpower. Allen considered that Australia and Canada were not making their proper contributions to the war effort. In response, Godley pointed out that the Australian divisions had seen <b>more</b> <b>action</b> than the New Zealanders.|$|E
5|$|Abram Lincoln Harris, Jr. (January 17, 1899 – November 6, 1963) was an American economist, academic, {{anthropologist}} and {{a social}} critic {{of blacks in the}} United States. Considered by many as the first African American to achieve prominence in the field of economics, Harris was also known for his heavy influence on black radical and neo-conservative thought in the United States. As an economist, Harris is most famous for his 1931 collaboration with political scientist Sterling Spero to produce a study on African-American labor history titled The Black Worker and his 1936 work The Negro as Capitalist, in which he criticized black businessmen for not promoting interracial trade. He headed the economics department at Howard University from 1936 to 1945 and taught at the University of Chicago from then until his death. As a social critic, Harris took an active radical stance on racial relations by examining historical black involvement in the workplace, and suggested that African Americans needed to take <b>more</b> <b>action</b> in race relations.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil 4 {{redefined the}} {{survival}} horror genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming, thus broadening the gameplay {{of the series}} with elements from the wider action game genre. However, this also led some reviewers {{to suggest that the}} Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror genre, by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established. Other major survival horror series followed suit, by developing their combat systems to feature <b>more</b> <b>action,</b> such as Silent Hill Homecoming and the 2008 version of Alone in the Dark. These changes represent an overall trend among console games shifting towards visceral action gameplay. While working on The Last of Us, Naughty Dog took cues from Resident Evil 4, particularly the tension and action.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} heavy {{media attention}} with over ten television stations and seventy news reporters being represented. The North Carolina Tar Heels jumped {{out to an}} early 197 lead in the first half, before the Jayhawks were able to close the lead before halftime. In the second half, the Jayhawks managed to fully overcome the deficit and take the lead. However, the Tar Heels were able {{to tie the game}} in the final minute, sending the game to overtime. The first overtime saw each team score a basket before time ran out, while the second overtime saw zero points scored due to poor offensive execution on both teams parts. The third overtime saw <b>more</b> <b>action</b> take place, with the Tar Heels winning the game 5453 as Joe Quigg made two free throws in the closing seconds to give the Tar Heels the lead.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Ocean Software ported {{the game}} to home gaming systems, {{including}} the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Due to the hardware limitations of the various systems, the graphics and sounds of the ports differ from the original arcade version. Some home versions use a light gun peripheral to simulate the control scheme of the arcade format. The Sega Master System port uses the Sega Light Phaser accessory. The Amiga and Atari ST versions {{are one of the}} few games to use the Trojan Light Gun. In developing the Amiga conversion, the team video taped the arcade machine in operation as a reference for the graphics, pausing the video at relevant spots to take notes before recreating them. Programmer Damien Stones spent four months on the ZX Spectrum version. He kept the graphical detail of the backgrounds simple to allow for <b>more</b> <b>action</b> in the foreground. Taking into account the system's lower capabilities compared to the arcade hardware, Stones designed {{the game to}} handle a large number of on-screen sprites. In 2005, Space Gun was included in the compilation title Taito Legends for the PlayStation 2, personal computer and Xbox.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Resident Evil 4 {{attempted}} {{to redefine the}} genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming, broadening the gameplay with elements from the wider action genre. Its ambitions paid off, earning the title several Game of the Year awards for 2005, and the top rank on IGN's Readers' Picks Top 99 Games list. However, this also led some reviewers {{to suggest that the}} Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror genre, by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established. Other major survival horror series followed suit by developing their combat systems to feature <b>more</b> <b>action,</b> such as Silent Hill Homecoming, and the 2008 version of Alone in the Dark. These changes were part of an overall trend among console games to shift towards visceral action gameplay. These changes in gameplay have led some purists to suggest that the genre has deteriorated into the conventions of other action games. Jim Sterling suggests that the genre lost its core gameplay when it improved the combat interface, thus shifting the gameplay away from hiding and running towards direct combat. Leigh Alexander argues that this represents a shift towards more Western horror aesthetics, which emphasize action and gore rather than the psychological experience of Japanese horror.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} calm, swift Parliament foundered on {{the rocks}} of {{religious}} conflict. On 27 February James Morice, a Puritan Member of Parliament, proposed two new bills: one against the bishops of the Church of England, and the other against the Court of High Commission. Morice was placed under house arrest, and seven Members of Parliament were later arrested, but the bills remained in Parliament. They were defended by Francis Knollys, {{one of the few}} remaining Puritan Members of Parliament, while other Puritans spat and coughed to drown out speeches by opponents. Coke and Cecil, the government's two strongest defenders in Parliament, made several efforts to put off or end the debate over the bills. Cecil first pointed out that the Queen had forbidden bills on religion; Parliament ignored him, and the bill went ahead. Coke, as Speaker of the House of Commons (whose job was to schedule any bills), conducted a delaying campaign, first suggesting that the bill was too long to be read in the morning and then that it be delegated to a committee; both suggestions were voted down by the Commons. Coke continued talking until the end of the Parliamentary day in a filibuster action, granting a day of delay for the government. Immediately afterwards, Coke was summoned by the Queen, who made it clear that any action on the bills would be considered evidence of disloyalty. The warning was accepted by the Commons, and no <b>more</b> <b>action</b> was taken on the two Puritan bills.|$|E

25|$|Unlike ciprofloxacin, {{levofloxacin}} {{does not}} appear to deactivate the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP1A2. Therefore, drugs that use that enzyme, like theophylline, do not interact with levofloxacin. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, suggesting potential to block the breakdown of warfarin and phenprocoumon. This can result in <b>more</b> <b>action</b> of drugs like warfarin, leading to more potential side effects, such as bleeding.|$|E

25|$|Following Isaiah Berlin, Halsema {{distinguishes between}} {{positive}} and negative freedom. Negative freedom is, according to Halsema, the freedom of citizens from government influence; she applies this concept especially to the multicultural society and the rechtsstaat, where the government should {{protect the rights of}} citizens and not limit them. Positive freedom is the emancipation of citizens from poverty and discrimination. Halsema wants to apply this concept to welfare state and the environment where government should take <b>more</b> <b>action.</b> According to Halsema, GreenLeft is an undogmatic party that has anarchist tendencies.|$|E
