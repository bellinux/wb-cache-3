5|$|In many {{developing}} countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat are <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet {{has been proposed}} as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.|$|E
5|$|A <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> black {{model was}} offered until the {{introduction}} of the unibody aluminum MacBook. The polycarbonate MacBook was the only Macintosh notebook (until the new 2015 model) to be offered in more than one color since the iBook G3 (Clamshell).|$|E
5|$|Besides repúblicas, studio apartments {{are very}} common around the university. While <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than the shared houses, they afford more privacy {{and have more}} {{flexible}} contracts, are well as being furnished.|$|E
30|$|SFFS is <b>more</b> {{computationally}} <b>expensive</b> than SFS [32].|$|R
25|$|The British would wage two <b>more</b> less <b>expensive</b> wars {{against the}} weaker Burmese in 1852 and 1885, and annex Burma by 1885.|$|R
50|$|<b>More</b> {{complicated}} and <b>expensive</b> to manufacture.|$|R
5|$|Each of {{the rooms}} has its own balcony and is {{designed}} in the Beverly Hills Hotel colors of peachy pinks and greens, apricots and yellows. Several of the <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> rooms have private patios, Jacuzzis and their own kitchens.|$|E
5|$|Palladium {{is one of}} {{the three}} most popular {{alloying}} metals in white gold (nickel and silver can also be used). Palladium-gold is <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than nickel-gold, but seldom causes allergic reactions (though certain cross-allergies with nickel may occur).|$|E
5|$|Stephen Fry {{announced}} in October 2009 that ITV was cancelling the series, a fact later {{confirmed by the}} channel, which said that given tighter budgets, <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> productions were being cut.|$|E
50|$|This {{relation}} {{may be used}} {{to generate}} the face lattice of an (n-1)-simplex efficiently, since face lattice enumeration algorithms applicable to general polytopes are <b>more</b> computationally <b>expensive.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cabin {{ejection}} is much <b>more</b> difficult, <b>expensive</b> {{and risky}} to retrofit on a vehicle not initially designed for it. If the shuttle was initially designed with a cabin escape system, {{that might have}} been more feasible.|$|R
50|$|Flame {{treatment}} is faster that corona treatment, but requires <b>more</b> complicated and <b>expensive</b> equipment.|$|R
5|$|The cost of Nevada Solar One is in {{the range}} of $220–250million. The power {{produced}} is slightly <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than wind power, but was less than photovoltaic (PV) power. As photovoltaics became less expensive, some proposed CSP projects have been converted to photovoltaics projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{product of}} a quadruple VAM (vacuum arc melting) process, {{combined}} with hot extruding and different rolling applications is cured using high-pressure, high-temperature gas autoclaving. This produces reactor-grade zirconium that is about 10 times <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than the hafnium-contaminated commercial grade.|$|E
5|$|Tête de nègre ("negro's head"; Boletus aereus), much rarer than B.edulis, is {{more highly}} {{regarded}} by gourmets, and <b>more</b> <b>expensive.</b> Usually smaller than B.edulis, {{it is also}} distinctively darker in colour. It is especially suited to drying.|$|E

50|$|Flight is <b>more</b> energetically <b>expensive</b> {{in larger}} birds, {{and many of}} the largest species fly by soaring and gliding (without {{flapping}} their wings) as much as possible. Many physiological adaptations have evolved that make flight more efficient.|$|R
50|$|If we do {{not know}} the radius of the circle we are trying to locate beforehand, we can use a {{three-dimensional}} accumulator space to search for circles with an arbitrary radius. Naturally, this is <b>more</b> computationally <b>expensive.</b>|$|R
5|$|A related process, {{flux-cored}} {{arc welding}} (FCAW), uses similar equipment but uses wire {{consisting of a}} steel electrode surrounding a powder fill material. This cored wire is <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than the standard solid wire and can generate fumes and/or slag, but it permits even higher welding speed and greater metal penetration.|$|E
5|$|Although Jersey {{does not}} have VAT, the States of Jersey {{introduced}} a goods and services tax (GST) on 6 May 2008, at a standard rate of 3%. The rate was amended to 5% on 1 June 2011. Although GST is at 5%, shopping in Jersey is still far <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than in the UK. Food is not exempt, unlike with VAT.|$|E
5|$|At market, sand whiting is medium priced fish, sold {{fresh or}} frozen; whole and in fillet form. In abundance, sand whiting is {{moderately}} priced, with fillets being slightly <b>more</b> <b>expensive.</b> The recovery rate of fillets from whole fish is about 40%. Sand whiting {{may be used}} as sashimi.|$|E
30|$|Even {{though the}} more {{advanced}} descriptors in the LBP family are <b>more</b> computationally <b>expensive</b> than the basic LBP, they are all computationally inexpensive compared to common filter bank-based texture descriptors such as Gabor filter banks and MR 8.|$|R

30|$|The best {{performing}} interpolation {{methods are}} only slightly <b>more</b> computationally <b>expensive.</b> Lanczos {{stands out as}} it is both the best interpolation method in terms of preserving texture information and faster to compute than the second best interpolation method B-spline.|$|R
5|$|Biofuels {{offer the}} {{prospect}} of real market competition and oil price moderation. According to the Wall Street Journal, crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would {{be as much as}} 25 per cent <b>more</b> <b>expensive,</b> {{if it were not for}} biofuels. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than levodopa.|$|E
5|$|Independent twin sets or {{independent}} doubles {{consists of two}} independent cylinders and two regulators, each with a submersible pressure gauge. This system is heavier, <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> to buy and maintain and <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> to fill than a single cylinder set. The diver must swap demand valves during the dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder. If this is not done, then if a cylinder should fail the diver may end up having an inadequate reserve. Independent twin sets do not work well with air-integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder. The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies. The cylinders may be mounted as a twin set on the diver's back, or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it, and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach.|$|E
50|$|Compared to conventional, single-element {{ultrasonic}} testing systems, PA instruments and probes are <b>more</b> complex and <b>expensive.</b>|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{the cost}} of land cover {{classification}} has been reduced significantly with the reduction of training set definition time. <b>More</b> importantly, <b>expensive</b> field surveys can be avoided for sample labeling, making our method suitable for practical large-scale SAR image understanding.|$|R
5000|$|Outsourcing risks - Although {{outsourcing}} to low-cost {{countries has}} become very popular, it does bring along risks such as language barriers, cultural differences and long lead times. This could make the management of contract manufacturers <b>more</b> difficult, <b>expensive</b> and time-consuming.|$|R
5|$|Iyo Railway {{bus service}} runs {{up and down}} the peninsula, to and from Yawatahama, and offers express buses from Misaki to Matsuyama. However, {{commuter}} buses run infrequently and, due to the length of the peninsula and the scattered nature of the town's neighborhoods, bus travel remains <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> and less convenient than in denser areas. Some tour buses also come across the strait from Kyūshū by ferry.|$|E
5|$|Julian {{supervised}} {{the assembly of}} the plant at Glidden {{when he arrived in}} 1936. He then designed and supervised construction of the world's first plant for the production of industrial-grade, isolated soy protein from oil-free soybean meal. Isolated soy protein could replace the <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> milk casein in industrial applications such as coating and sizing of paper, glue for making Douglas fir plywood, and in the manufacture of water-based paints.|$|E
5|$|Mercury is used {{primarily}} for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications. It is used in some thermometers, especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures. A still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in fluorescent lamps, {{while most of the}} other applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> Galinstan alloy.|$|E
50|$|The sender quickly computes {{the rolling}} {{checksum}} for each chunk in {{its version of}} the file; if they differ, it must be sent. If they're the same, the sender uses the <b>more</b> computationally <b>expensive</b> MD5 hash to verify the chunks are the same.|$|R
25|$|Another way {{of looking}} at it is to {{consider}} the regression line to be a weighted average of the lines passing through the combination of any two points in the dataset. Although this way of calculation is <b>more</b> computationally <b>expensive,</b> it provides a better intuition on OLS.|$|R
50|$|The {{next phase}} was to “paint the canyon with light.” This phase {{took two years}} of planning, {{required}} <b>more</b> people, <b>expensive</b> equipment, and permits from multiple level governmental agencies. The pair lobbied regional environmental groups, the art community, and local public officials for permission and support.|$|R
