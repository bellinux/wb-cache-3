5|$|Beginning about 6:45, {{many members}} of the public began calling NBC network and {{affiliate}} switchboards. Some demanded the game be shown to its conclusion; others wanted to know if Heidi would start on time. These calls jammed the switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to countermand the midweek written orders, but Cline received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, and not knowing of Goodman's approval, Cline <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> Heidi would start on time. The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word cue, to the outraged shock of Ellis and Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation instead saw a little girl on a Swiss mountain and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.|$|E

25|$|One {{field in}} which the Socialist League did have {{practical}} work to do involved the fight for the right of free speech in London during 1885 and 1886. Whereas religious organisations such as the Salvation Army were allowed to preach in the streets, the London Metropolitan Police banned the Socialists from similar activities. Members of the Socialist League and their rivals the SDF simply continued to speak and to incur fines, attracting public attention, until the authorities <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> their prosecution was counterproductive and stopped their interference. Thereafter, public interest in the street meetings rapidly evaporated.|$|E

Musk and then-president and CEO of X.com, Bill Harris, disagreed on this point and Harris left the company in May 2000. In October of that year, Musk <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> X.com would terminate its other Internet banking operations and focus on the PayPal money service. The X.com company was then renamed PayPal in 2001, and expanded rapidly throughout the year until company executives decided to take PayPal public in 2002. Paypal's IPO listed under the ticker PYPL at $13 per share and ended up generating over $61 million.|$|E

50|$|Four Raider battalions served operationally but {{all were}} disbanded on 8 January 1944 when <b>the</b> Corps <b>made</b> <b>the</b> doctrinal <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Raiders had outlived their {{original}} mission.

He is quoted as saying: [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> I didn't care if there was any money in the role or not. I had to find roles that were different from what I had been doing." [...] His turn in Desperate Hours as antagonist showed a darker Morse.

500|$|Differing {{accounts}} exist of who <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> Mussolini {{should be}} summarily executed. Palmiro Togliatti, the Secretary-General of the Communist Party, {{claimed that he}} had ordered Mussolini's execution prior to his capture. Togliatti said he had done so by a radio message on 26 April 1945 with the words: [...] "Only one thing is needed to decide that they [...] must pay with their lives: the question of their identity". He also claimed that he had given the order as deputy prime minister {{of the government in}} Rome and as leader of the Communist Party. Ivanoe Bonomi, the prime minister, later denied that this was said with his government's authority or approval. A senior communist in Milan, Luigi Longo, said that the order came from the General Command of the partisan military units [...] "in application of a CLNAI decision". Longo subsequently gave a different story: he said that when he and Fermo Solari, a member of the Action Party (which was part of the CLNAI), heard the news of Mussolini's capture they immediately agreed that he should be summarily executed and Longo gave the order for it to be carried out.|$|E
500|$|The three sisters, Este Arielle Haim (b. March 14, 1986), Danielle Sari Haim (b. February 16, 1989) and Alana Mychal Haim (b. December 15, 1991) {{were born}} and raised in the San Fernando Valley, California, to a Jewish family. [...] Their Israeli-born father Mordechai ("Moti") and their mother Donna were both musical; though he had been a {{professional}} soccer player in Israel, Moti also played drums, while Donna won a contest on The Gong Show in the 1970s singing a Bonnie Raitt song. While Danielle showed an aptitude for the guitar at a young age, Moti <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> Este would be more suited to the bass, buying her a second hand Fender for $50. The siblings were encouraged to listen to their parents' 1970s classic rock and Americana records and, during their childhood, the family formed a band called Rockinhaim to play cover versions at local charity fairs, with Moti on drums and Donna on guitar. The group played typical wedding band material, including the Beatles' [...] "Get Back", Billy Joel's [...] "You May Be Right" [...] and Van Morrison's [...] "Brown Eyed Girl", but only did free community and benefit gigs at churches, schools and hospitals.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that privity {{is not even}} a {{distinct}} doctrine, but rather simply part of consideration. Consideration is a rule that there must be a [...] "benefit or detriment" [...] involved in any contract, and that this must initially come from the promisee. It is argued that this rule and the doctrine of privity are two ways of saying the same thing - that to say someone is not a party to the contract is the same as saying that they gave no consideration in the initial agreement. This attitude is found in decisions by the Judiciary of England and Wales - in, Tweddle v Atkinson, Crompton and Blackburn JJ <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> they did because the claimant had not provided consideration, and the majority in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd based their judgment on a similar point. It is worth noting, however, that [...] Lord Haldane maintained in his judgement in Dunlop that, independent of consideration, it was a rule in English law that [...] "only a person who is party to a contract can sue on it".|$|E

500|$|Also {{instrumental}} in exposing Eichmann's identity was Lothar Hermann, a half-Jewish German who had emigrated to Argentina in 1938. When in 1956 Hermann's daughter Sylvia began dating {{a man named}} Klaus Eichmann who boasted about his father's Nazi exploits, Hermann alerted Fritz Bauer, prosecutor-general {{of the state of}} Hesse in West Germany. Sylvia, sent on a fact-finding mission, was met at the door by Eichmann himself, who said he was Klaus's uncle. Informed that Klaus was not home, she sat down to wait. When Klaus returned, he addressed Eichmann as [...] "Father". In 1957 Bauer passed along the information in person to Mossad director Isser Harel, who assigned operatives to undertake surveillance, but no concrete evidence was initially found. On 1 March 1960 Harel dispatched to Buenos Aires the Shin Bet chief interrogator Zvi Aharoni, who over the course of weeks of investigation was able to confirm the identity of the fugitive. As Argentina had a history of turning down extradition requests for Nazi criminals, Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> Eichmann should be captured rather than extradited, and brought to Israel for trial. Harel himself arrived in person in May 1960 to oversee the capture. Mossad operative Rafi Eitan was named leader of the eight-man team, most of whom were Shin Bet agents.|$|E
500|$|In Europe in the 1990s, a {{successful}} driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, {{the pinnacle of}} the sport, or to the International Formula 3000 championship. However, Hill {{did not have enough}} sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says [...] "I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first thing was to realise how lucky I was to be driving anything. I <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> whatever I drove I would do it {{to the best of my}} ability and see where it led." [...] He took a one-off drive in the lower level British F3000 championship and shared a Porsche 962 at Le Mans for Richard Lloyd Racing, where the engine failed after 228laps. He also competed in one race in the British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park, driving a Ford Sierra RS500. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and Perry McCarthy. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a Lola chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.|$|E

Robbie said she had [...] "big shoes to fill", but she was honoured to be working on her biggest storyline since she arrived.
