40|$|The innovator's {{choice to}} find the optimal {{financing}} is complex and influenced by his individual requirements as well as SME specific financial constraints in the market. The lack of experience and supply with external sources of finance is a serious inhibiting factor for innovation in SMEs. Data shows that most SMEs are familiar with bank loans but rarely have contact or access to <b>mezzanine</b> and equity <b>capital.</b> Debt capital is not always available, is more expensive for innovative ventures and further weakens the credit rating. Hence, <b>mezzanine</b> and equity <b>capital</b> are often seen as yet underestimated forms of financing. But due to an equity gap in the market, innovative SMEs also struggle to acquire fresh capital in form of equity. While still being negligible small in comparison, crowdfunding attempts to grow into several financial areas and has promising potential to open up new sources of capital for entrepreneurs and innovative SMEs. This paper presents a comparative theoretical study of current financial alternatives with special regard to innovative ventures. It identifies the relevant properties on profound academic literature and the empirical evidence on its fit to innovation financing is reviewed. The paper aims {{to contribute to the}} discussion of financial constraints for innovative SMEs and will give indications for further research. Results show that crowdfunding has distinct advantages in its value creation by the funding community, but is still exceptional in larger innovative projects and may then have high requirements regarding human and capital resources. While traditional forms of financing still have distinct advantages for their own, synergies and combinations with crowdfunding will be discussed based on their individual characteristics. It may be promising to combine traditional and new innovative forms of financing to gain synergy effects and to mitigate information asymmetries for traditional investors. SIN FINANCIACIÓNUE...|$|R

The study covers the history and current state of mezzanine finance in Estonia by interviewing top Estonian financial specialists. The results of the study indicate that the history on the use of mezzanine finance in Estonia has been extremely low even though financial advisers have been offering this type of financial advice for years.

40|$|Most of the {{investments}} in asset classes such as {{real estate and}} private equity (include buyout, <b>mezzanine</b> and venture <b>capital)</b> are made via private partnerships. Measuring performance in these partnerships is important for investment allocation decision {{as well as for}} compensation. The main performance measure that is used in practice is the Internal Rate of Return (IRR). However, it is known that the effective Rate of Return (RoR) experienced by investors differs from IRR. This difference means that the incentives of the asset managers partly differ from the objective of the investors. This article makes two main contributions to the literature on performance evaluation. First, it shows the problems that arise when IRR is used as a performance measure in the context of private partnership investments. It shows that in addition to the well-known pitfalls, IRR leads to a number of issues. First, it provides severely distorted incentives for the timing of cash flows and grouping of funds. Second, it biases upward volatility estimates. Third, at least for venture capital and buyout investments, simple average performance measures are significantly upward biased. Fourth, in a situation where "kick-backs" can happen, the use of IRR provides incentives to alter significantly cash flow amounts. The second contribution is that it describes in details a solution. While it is known that using Modified IRR (labeled MIRR), or, equivalently, Net Present Value, (labeled NPV) largely tackles the well-known pitfalls of IRR, its practical implementation in a private partnership context is not obvious. I show how MIRR can be implemented at the investment level and at the fund level in order to not only tackle the well-known pitfalls of IRR but also provide the right incentives to the fund managers...|$|R
