"It is a dog, {{though not}} of our <b>mountain</b> <b>breed!</b> The mastiffs of the convent {{have failed in}} hospitality, and the poor beast has been driven to take refuge in this retired spot, in waiting for his master, who {{probably}} makes one of the party in the refectory.

The low size, and wild, shaggy, untrained state of the animal, reminded Quentin of the <b>mountain</b> <b>breed</b> of horses in his own country, but this was much more finely limbed, and, with the same appearance of hardiness, was more rapid in its movements. The head particularly, which, in the Scottish pony, is often lumpish and heavy, was small and well placed in the neck of this animal, with thin jaws, full sparkling eyes, and expanded nostrils.|$|E
60|$|While Julian remained, as if spell-bound to his chair, scarce more {{surprised}} at the company in which he found himself, than at the opinions {{to which he was}} listening, another circumstance reminded him that the proper time of his stay at Black Fort had been expended. Little Fairy, the Manx pony, which, well accustomed to the vicinity of Black Fort, used to feed near the house while her master made his visits there, began to find his present stay rather too long. She had been the gift of the Countess to Julian, whilst a youth, and came of a high-spirited <b>mountain</b> <b>breed,</b> remarkable alike for hardiness, for longevity, and for a degree of sagacity approaching to that of the dog. Fairy showed the latter quality, by the way in which she chose to express her impatience to be moving homewards. At least such seemed the purpose of the shrill neigh with which she startled the female inmates of the parlour, who, the moment afterwards, could not forbear smiling to see the nose of the pony advanced through the opened casement.|$|E

60|$|The {{following}} morning, incessant rain till 11 o'clock, {{when the}} sky began to clear, and we walked along {{the eastern shore of}} Ullswater towards the farm of Blowick. The wind blew strong, and drove the clouds forward, {{on the side of the}} mountain above our heads;--two storm-stiffened black yew-trees fixed our notice, seen through, or under the edge of, the flying mists,--four or five goats were bounding among the rocks;--the sheep moved about more quietly, or cowered beneath their sheltering places. This is the only part of the country where goats are now found;[66] but this morning, before we had seen these, I was reminded of that picturesque animal by two rams of <b>mountain</b> <b>breed,</b> both with Ammonian horns, and with beards majestic as that which Michael Angelo has given to his statue of Moses.--But to return; when our path had brought us to that part of the naked common which overlooks the woods and bush-besprinkled fields of Blowick, the lake, clouds, and mists were all in motion to the sound of sweeping winds;--the church and cottages of Patterdale scarcely visible, or seen only by fits between the shifting vapours. To the northward the scene was less visionary;--Place Fell steady and bold;--the whole lake driving onward like a great river--waves dancing round the small islands. The house at Blowick was the boundary of our walk; and we returned, lamenting to see a decaying and uncomfortable dwelling in a place where sublimity and beauty seemed to contend with each other. But these regrets were dispelled by a glance on the woods that clothe the opposite steeps of the lake. How exquisite was the mixture of sober and splendid hues! The general colouring of the trees was brown--rather that of ripe hazel nuts; but towards the water, there were yet beds of green, and in the highest parts of the wood, was abundance of yellow foliage, which, gleaming through a vapoury lustre, reminded us of masses of clouds, as you see them gathered together in the west, and touched with the golden light of the setting sun.|$|E

50|$|The Asturian <b>Mountain</b> <b>breed</b> {{has been}} part of the {{landscape}} and ecosystem of the east of Asturias for a very long time. This breed belongs to an exclusive bovine group in Spain known as the tronco Cantábrico ('Cantabric trunk') that only includes breeds native to northern Spain, the most numerous of which are the Asturian Valley cattle. The Asturian Mountain is a descendant of the eastern Roxa beef cattle group, historically located in Asturias. Consequently, the breed is sometimes referred to as the RAM (Roxa, Asturian Mountain). This group is distinct from the western Roxa cattle, despite evidence of further variability among animals and areas within the population. For centuries, breeders of the eastern Roxa group in the council of Caso and bordering valleys such as Ponga, selected for higher milk yields aimed at cheese production. This selection made a reputation for the bulls from the council of Caso because of their daughters’ higher milk yield, and changed their farms into sire exporters for the whole of the east of Asturias, playing an important part in the fixation of what nowadays we know as the Asturian <b>Mountain</b> <b>breed.</b>|$|E

It has a 10-fold greater incidence in dogs than humans. A hereditary base has been shown in St. Bernard dogs. Spayed/neutered dogs have twice the risk of intact ones to develop osteosarcoma. Infestation with the parasite Spirocerca lupi can cause osteosarcoma of the esophagus.|$|R

5000|$|The Badger Face Welsh Mountain (Welsh Defaid Idloes {{also known}} as Badger Faced Welsh Mountain or Welsh Badger-faced) is a {{distinct}} variety of the Welsh <b>Mountain</b> <b>breed</b> of domestic sheep bred for Sheep farming in Wales. It is a hardy upland breed known for producing {{a high percentage of}} twins and triplets under good conditions. It appears in two sub-varieties of its own: the Torddu ( [...] , [...] "black-bellied"), which has a white fleece with dark face and belly, and the Torwen ( [...] , [...] "white-bellied"), which has a black body with a white belly and white stripes over the eyes. The Torddu is the more common of the two types. In both types, ewes are polled and rams are horned. Although this breed grows wool, it is primarily raised for meat.|$|E
5000|$|Balwen Welsh Mountain sheep {{originate}} from one small area of Wales [...] - [...] the Tywi valley. This area was hit badly {{by the very}} severe British winter of 1946-1947, and the breed was nearly wiped out [...] - [...] only one ram was amongst the survivors. All modern Balwen sheep are therefore presumably descended from this one ram, although {{it is possible that}} some of the ewes may have been in lamb to rams that did not survive the winter. Outcrossing with other types of Welsh Mountain sheep may also have occurred, and this would have increased the genetic diversity of the breed. During the 1950s and 1960s a steady increase took place, and in the 1970s people outside the valley began to take an interest in the breed. The Balwen Welsh <b>Mountain</b> <b>Breed</b> Society was formed in 1985, and numbers are gradually increasing further.|$|E

The fat content of G 1 (5. 18 %) and G 2 (5. 25 %) were significantly higher compared to G 3 (4. 90 %) and G 4 (4. 95 %). Dairy cows fed 0. 5 Kg concentrate attained the highest (P< 0. 05) ash (0. 9 %) followed by G 1 (0. 8 %) and those fed 1. 5 Kg (0. 79 %), which were not significantly different, while G 3 recorded the lowest ash (0. 7 %).

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{evaluate}} reproductive performance of native Hungarian Gyimesi racka (GR) and Romanian Turcana (TA) sheep breeds, belonging to the Central and Eastern European Zackel group. In TA breed the average conception rate was 96. 11 ± 0. 024 %, while in GR it was 93. 29 ± 0. 064 %, {{the differences between the two}} genotypes were significant (p≤ 0. 001). For the prolificacy trait, TA ewes registered an average of 118. 94 ± 0. 051 %, while GR ewes had an average of 105. 78 ± 0. 059 %, differences between the two breeds were significant (p≤ 0. 001). Lamb survival rate from birth to weaning was not affected by the genotype (p≤ 0. 05), with TA lambs having survival rates of 97. 32 ± 0. 019 % and the GR lambs 97. 70 ± 0. 038 %. Differences between reproduction performances of the two related breeds could be caused by the management and rearing practices in the two countries.
