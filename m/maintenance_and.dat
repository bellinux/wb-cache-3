5|$|From {{the late}} 1960s, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} {{of the benefits of}} retaining the canal.

The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for such action, and a visit in 1971 to see the work being done on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal as part of the creation of the Brecon Beacons National Park convinced the Council of the wisdom of such a course of action. By 1974, Higher and Lower Maunsel locks, which are listed buildings, had been refurbished by the British Waterways Board, with funding from the County Council. Funding for towpath <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> weed cutting was also provided.|$|E
