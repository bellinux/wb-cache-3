5|$|On June 26, 2007, Maxwell Football Club {{president}} Ron Jaworski {{announced that}} McCoy {{had been named}} to the preseason watch list for the Maxwell Award. The initial list includes 64 players. The winner {{turned out to be}} Tim Tebow. In their 2007 season preview magazine, CBS Sportsline.com listed McCoy as one of twelve players on the “Heisman Watch”; saying “We were touting him for the Heisman midway through his freshman season until he was injured against Kansas State. Older and stronger, McCoy has an awesome receiving corps to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> the hardware for real.” He {{is also one of the}} 35 quarterbacks placed on the 2007 Manning Award watch list. Further, the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award Watch List added McCoy on August 21, 2007.|$|E
25|$|After Halas resigned, Gibron {{continued}} {{as an assistant}} under new head coach Jim Dooley in 1968. He switched to coaching the defensive line the following year when assistant coach Joe Fortunato resigned and Jim Ringo was hired to coach the offensive line. Dooley, however, was dismissed in late 1971 after three consecutive losing seasons, including a 1–13 record in 1969. Gibron was elevated to head coach the following January and said the team had the talent to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> the NFL championship.|$|E
25|$|As an {{unrestricted}} free agent {{prior to the}} 2003–04 season, Payton, along with Karl Malone, signed with the Los Angeles Lakers to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> their first NBA Championship. Payton started in all 82 games and averaged 14.6 points with 5.5 assists and 1.2 steals but struggled with Lakers coach Phil Jackson's triangle offense, which limited his ball-handling and post-up opportunities. Payton provided offense in games where superstar teammates Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe Bryant could not play due to injury, including a 30-point output in an overtime win against the Cleveland Cavaliers on February 4.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, Miller {{was hired}} as President of the Portland Trail Blazers, {{replacing}} interim president Tod Leiweke. Under Miller's management, the Trail Blazers have positioned themselves to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> respectable <b>run</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> NBA title. Portland has recorded three consecutive trips to the postseason while riding a streak of 159 consecutive sellouts dating back to December 21, 2007.|$|R
25|$|In 2009–10 the Barrie Colts {{celebrated their}} 15th {{season in the}} OHL. The Colts {{attempted}} to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> the Memorial Cup by bringing in proven goal scorers like Bryan Cameron and Luke Pither. They also upgraded their defence by bringing in Nick Crawford, T. J. Brodie and St. Louis Blues draftpick Alex Pietrangelo. Role players like Zac Rinaldo, Matt Kennedy, and goalie Mavric Parks were also traded for before the deadline. All of these trades seemed to have paid dividends as the Colts had a 22-game win-streak, and finished the regular season with an unprecedented record of 57–9–0–2, {{for a total of}} 116 points. Bryan Cameron scored a franchise record 53 goals and the team captured their fourth Emms Trophy for finishing first in the Central Division, and also the franchises first Hamilton Spectator Trophy for finishing first overall in the OHL. Beginning the 2009–10 playoffs the Colts quickly defeated the Sudbury Wolves 4–0 in the Conference Quarter-Finals, before sweeping the Brampton Battalion in the Conference Semi-Finals. In the Conference Finals the Colts finally met some stiff competition but were still able to defeat the Mississauga St. Michael's Majors 4–1 and win the Bobby Orr Trophy. In the J. Ross Robertson Cup finals the Barrie Colts hosted the defending Memorial Cup Champions Windsor Spitfires who the Colts had defeated both times the two teams met in the regular season. The Colts never looked on top of their game, making uncharacteristic defensive mistakes. The Colts were defeated in four games bringing an end to one of the best OHL seasons in history.|$|E
25|$|The {{summer of}} 1998 brought {{an abrupt end}} to the {{championship}} era. Krause felt that the Bulls {{were on the verge}} of being too old and unable to compete. He decided that the team's only choices were to rebuild or endure a slow decline. His plan was to trade away the aging talent and acquire high draft picks while clearing salary cap space to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> several promising free agents in two years' time. After having been vetoed in a previous attempt by owner Jerry Reinsdorf, Krause traded Scottie Pippen for Roy Rogers (who was released in February 1999) and a conditional second-round draft pick from the Houston Rockets. He also decided not to re-sign Dennis Rodman, and traded Luc Longley and Steve Kerr for other draft picks. He hired a new coach, Tim Floyd, who had run a successful program at Iowa State University. Upon Phil Jackson's departure, Michael Jordan made his second retirement official. With a new starting lineup of point guard Randy Brown, shooting guard Ron Harper, newcomer Brent Barry at small forward, power forward Toni Kukoč, and center Bill Wennington, the team began the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. Kukoc led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists, but the team won only 13 of 50 games. The lowest point of the season came on April 10 in a game against the Miami Heat. In that game, the Bulls scored 49 points to set an NBA record for the fewest points in a game in the shot clock era.|$|E

Campbell-Brown had a sizable lead with the inexperienced (at this distance) Jeter the only one to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> serious <b>run</b> <b>at</b> her, but this race being double her normal distance, Jeter couldn't hold it and started to fall back awkwardly.

50|$|Winning {{the double}} {{combined}} with some fine European outings during previous season raised the fans' expectations considerably as they now wanted the existing Red Star squad {{to be kept}} intact (especially Nikola Žigić who reportedly at the time became a target of some high-profile English Premiership clubs) in order to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> serious <b>run</b> <b>at</b> qualifying for the UEFA Champions League. However, the first move came as a complete shock - president Stojković sold goalkeeper Vladimir Stojković to FC Nantes, reportedly for €3 million. Trying {{to deal with the}} angry fan reaction, he attempted to explain that the move had been necessary to cover the club debt that grew to alarming levels following years of mismanagement and unpaid commitments of some key sponsor pool members. The wholesale continued with Nenad Kovačević, Milan Dudić, Haminu Dramani, Aleksandar Luković, and Boško Janković also leaving, but their departures caused comparatively less angry fan reaction. However most were still disappointed to see the winning team disassembled and sold off so quickly.|$|R

30|$|State-based {{schedules}} [7, 8] {{are effective}} in saving system resources for hard real-time systems because of scheduling messages for the average-case rather than the worst-case, and several case studies across different application areas already demonstrate the advantages of this approach including control theory [9], hybrid systems [10], video-on-demand, hierarchical scheduling frameworks [11], and bursty demand models [12, 13]. It is possible to avoid executing the worst-case due {{to the ability of}} making on-the-fly decisions <b>at</b> <b>run</b> time. On the other hand, messages are always scheduled for the worst-case in the traditional static scheme that is TDMA-based and does not allow to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> decision <b>at</b> <b>run</b> time.|$|R
5000|$|On the field, the 2002 Expos {{exceeded}} {{expectations and}} were in playoff contention {{for much of the}} season. Due to their being owned by the other teams, the Expos were caught in a situation where increasing payroll for a last-ditch postseason drive would have required asking their direct competitors for money. Operating under the belief that the Expos were playing their last season in Montreal, Minaya completed a blockbuster trade with the Cleveland Indians in late June to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> final <b>run</b> <b>at</b> bringing post-season success to the city, acquiring Bartolo Colón, one of baseball's top pitchers, in exchange for several star prospects and without increasing payroll. Remembering how the Seattle Mariners had revived a stalled bid for what became Safeco Field with <b>a</b> playoff <b>run</b> in 1995, Minaya believed that if the Expos made the playoffs, the renewed public and private sector support would lead to a viable owner stepping forward who would keep the team in Montreal. Minaya made several smaller moves, but the team lost its early-season momentum; they went seven games under [...]500 in July and August. The Expos finished with an 83-79 record - their first winning season since 1996 - but finished second in the NL East, 19 games out of both the division lead and the wild card.|$|R
5000|$|The Centre is {{featured}} {{as the main}} antagonist in Justice League: The New Frontier voiced by Keith David. This version is a monstrous creature born from the Earth that has {{the appearance of a}} floating island, and developed traits far beyond those of lesser beings. An organic sentient being observed the evolution of dinosaurs, the meteor shower, and the evolution of humans. It saw humans {{as a threat to the}} existence of other species and settled in the Pacific. Over the centuries, it has gained a reputation of an omnipresent spirit with no beginning nor end. Different cultures describe the same legend, the coming of an ominous, all-powerful presence and great suffering. The famous children's author, Theodore Smiesel was overcome by the Centre's telepathy and wrote [...] "The Last Story" [...] describing the Centre. After the book's completion, Smiesel committed suicide. After it rose in 1957, there was a steady rise in the number of related incidents-mass delusions, people hearing voices in their heads and performing violent acts. It came across Paradise Island and attacked the Amazons. Wonder Woman was able to escape and warn Superman before the Centre's arrival offshore. A collective of government officials and superheroes formed a multi-faceted plan to defeat the Centre. While they distract it with explosive payloads from outside and within, the Flash (Barry Allen) would expose it piece by piece with matter shrinking technology created by Ray Palmer. It sensed its end and attempted to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> suicide <b>run</b> <b>at</b> Cape Canaveral. Green Lantern intervened and used his newly-discovered powers to encapsulate the Centre and hurl it into space where its body implodes. The Centre's powers include hovering by means of energy propulsion, controlling its substance to extrude tentacles and spawn giant dinosaurs to attack or defend itself, discharge intense blasts of energy through ports, and use telepathy at vast distances to control minds or use illusions.|$|R

40|$|The economy {{continues}} {{along the}} general trajectory described in recent Surveys. Growth is picking up, led by consumption but restrained by investment. Inflation has fallen well below Bank Indonesia's current target rate. Most {{interest rates have}} followed suit, including key lending rates. Bank lending has been expanding at around 20 % p. a. {{for the past year}} or so, and international portfolio investors are again interested in Indonesia. But a scare in the mutual funds industry and scandals at two state banks remind that trouble still simmers just below the surface in the financial sector. Fiscal policy continues its conservative stance. The government is likely to have achieved its 2003 deficit target, and the budget for 2004 envisages further narrowing of the deficit. Still, the deadline for achieving a modest budgetary surplus has slipped two years, to 2006. Draft amendments to the income tax law foreshadow a probable reduction in corporate tax rates, increases in personal rates, and removal of certain key exemptions. Proposed administrative changes would give tax officials significantly greater powers of investigation and prosecution; observers foresee increased scope for extortion by unscrupulous officials. Monetary policy has become increasingly expansionary, given the central bank's desire to support economic recovery and its success in driving inflation down. This is reflected in quite rapid base money growth and sharp falls in policy interest rates, notwithstanding some efforts by Bank Indonesia to slow their decline. Trade policy has been dominated by increasing signs of resurgent protectionism, including a shift away from a transparent tariff regime to rent-generating systems of licensing. On the political front, opinion polls in advance of the national elections suggest a considerable shift in the parliament, away from PDI-P in favour of Golkar. The size of this shift will be critical in determining the choice of candidates for the subsequent presidential elections. At present, Megawati Sukarnoputri remains the front-runner, but almost any combination of major parties could still form <b>a</b> coalition and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> credible <b>run</b> <b>at</b> the presidency. With elections looming, little further progress can be expected on the economic policy front in 2004. In these circumstances, the focus for progress shifts to a politically independent Bank Indonesia. With strong policies in its areas of responsi-bility—inflation, monetary policy and financial sector development—further progress is achievable even during an election year. This would lay a solid foundation for robust economic recovery, hopefully policy driven by the next administration. ...|$|R
