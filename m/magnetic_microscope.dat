40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{development}} of a scanning <b>magnetic</b> <b>microscope</b> (MM) without appreciable applied forces or magnetic excitations on specimens is presented. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>microscope</b> is intended to measure weak magnetic field distributions near the object surface at micron and sub-micron scales. Specifically, the MM consists of three measurement units with respective output channels. The first channel uses a special fluxgate magnetometer as a field detector, and is designed for magnetic study of a specimen surface at room temperature (T= 300 K), with a magnetic sensitivity of 10 " 9 T, at a spatial resolution of 10 u,m in a scan area of 10 x 10 mm. The second channel uses a HTSC SQUID and a ferromagnetic flux concentrator, and is intended for detailed study of a room-temperature object at the sensitivity of 10 ' 12 T with 0. 1 - 1 Jim resolutions. The third component also uses the SQUID-concentrator combination, but is intended for detailed study of the object at liquid-nitrogen temperature (T= 77 K), covering the area of lOOxlOOjum...|$|E

30|$|In Nojima fault gouge, {{we found}} billow-like wavy folds which {{are similar in}} form to Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instabilities. Scanning <b>magnetic</b> <b>microscope</b> using MI and SQUID sensors {{detected}} the presence of magnetic minerals in the slip zone surrounding the billow-like wavy fold.

BSE observations indicated the billow-like wavy folds consisted of micrometer-sized finely comminuted grains without flow structures associated with melting. These results suggest that fluidization induced by fault rupture and frictional heating was the driving mechanism of fault lubrication.|$|E

30|$|To {{determine}} the {{spatial distribution of}} ferrimagnetic minerals in Nojima fault gouge, we used a custom-made scanning MI <b>magnetic</b> <b>microscope</b> developed by Uehara and Nakamura (2007, 2008). This allows mapping of the two-dimensional vertical component of a magnetic field by documenting dipole-like features with a spatial resolution of 0.4  mm with a magnetic sensitivity of 10  nT (Uehara and Nakamura 2007, 2008). The distance between the MI sensor head and the thin-section sample was about 300  μm. Since the stray magnetic field of fault gouge on thin sections was weaker than the MI sensitivity, the thin-section samples were given isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) at 1  T by pulse magnetizer (Magnetic Measurements MMPM 10) to emphasize the spatial distribution of ferrimagnetic minerals.|$|E

The tip is used to obtain high-resolution domain images of a CoCrPt-SiO 2 /Ru perpendicular recording medium with linear recording densities from 800 to 1000 kfci. Magnetic patterns of 900 kfci, corresponding to a bit size of 28 nm, are well resolved.

The microscope consists of a high-temperature superconductor (HTS) dc SQUID sensor, suspended in vacuum with a self-adjusting standoff, close spaced liquid nitrogen Dewar, X-Y scanning stage and a computer control system.

A high-resolution video telescope and a 1 mum precision z-axis positioning system allow a close positioning of the sample under the sensor.
