5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control {{in order to keep}} its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. It can be very difficult to eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be <b>most</b> <b>effective,</b> though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E

The benefits of large guns over trebuchets– the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> siege engine of the Middle Ages {{before the advent of}} gunpowder– were those of a greater range and power. In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles. By the 1450s guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mehmed II at the Fall of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Bill of Rights was {{submitted}} to the states for ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties.

Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention, which they desired.

3000|$|<b>Most</b> Cost <b>Effective</b> {{scenarios}} (Scenarios 2 A, 4 A and 4 B – Investment and Operational Grants with {{or without}} Price Cap and only operational grant without price cap): The <b>most</b> cost <b>effective</b> scenarios in terms of budget spent per child enrolled {{as a result of}} these policies, are represented by Scenarios 2 and 4 where the operational and investment grants are provided together. When a price cap is introduced, the benefit incidence accrues more to the poor households. Hence Scenario 4 B where operational grants are provided together with investment grants and with a price cap is the most cost-effective and pro-poor scenario in terms of benefit incidence. Overall, these are the <b>most</b> cost <b>effective</b> and hence <b>most</b> recommended scenarios in the simulation – whereby the twin goals of attaining higher capacity and enrollments are also matched with a concern for lower costs per child and a pro-poor distribution.|$|R
