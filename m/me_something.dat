And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give <b>me</b> <b>something</b> (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E

500|$|Murray {{struggled}} with her sexual and gender identity {{through much of}} her life. Her marriage as a teenager ended almost immediately {{with the realization that}} [...] "when men try to make love to <b>me,</b> <b>something</b> in me fights". Although acknowledging the term [...] "homosexual" [...] in describing others, Murray preferred to describe herself as having an [...] "inverted sex instinct" [...] that caused her to behave as a man attracted to women would. She wanted a [...] "monogamous married life", but one in which she was the man. The majority of her relationships were with women whom she described as [...] "extremely feminine and heterosexual". In her younger years, Murray often was devastated by the end of these relationships, to the extent that she was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment twice, in 1937 and in 1940.|$|E
500|$|Barrett, {{along with}} Pink Floyd's managers, Peter Jenner and King, wanted {{to release the}} song as a single in the new year, before being vetoed by both the band and Norman Smith.

[...] When {{compared}} to [...] "Bike" [...] and [...] "The Scarecrow", Jenner said [...] "You think, 'Well, OK, those are all right, but these are powerful disturbing art.' I wouldn't want anyone {{to have to go}} as mad and disturbed as Syd did to get that, but {{if you are going to}} go that disturbed give <b>me</b> <b>something</b> like that. That's great art." [...] Jenner had also called [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] "an extraordinary song, the ultimate self-diagnosis on a state of schizophrenia, [...] the portrait of a nervous breakdown." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1988, Kim Deal of the Pixies and Tanya Donelly of Throwing Muses became {{good friends}} {{when the two}} bands toured Europe together. Deal and Donelly spent time playing guitar and {{drinking}} beer, and shared musical ideas with each other. During the tour, and later in Boston—the hometown of both groups—the two friends often went clubbing together. On one outing at a Sugarcubes concert, dance music was playing between sets, and the two drunkenly decided to write and record some dance songs. They envisioned an [...] "organic dance band" [...] that would consist of Deal on bass, Donelly on guitar, and two drummers; they recorded Donelly's composition [...] "Rise" [...] with Throwing Muses' David Narcizo, and planned to do other originals, {{as well as a}} cover of Rufus and Chaka Khan's [...] "Tell <b>Me</b> <b>Something</b> Good". However, Deal and Donelly eventually decided that their dance music concept was not working well, and did not pursue it.|$|E

500|$|Adamson also {{desired to}} make the film larger in scale; [...] "I've gained {{confidence}} having gone through the first. This time, I {{was able to go}} larger [...] scale, with more extras and bigger battle scenes." [...] Inspired by a passage in the novel where Reepicheep says he would like to attack the castle, a new battle scene in which Peter and Caspian make an attempted raid on Miraz's castle was created. Adamson felt the imagery of mythological Greek creatures storming a castle was highly original. Markus and McFeely used the sequence to illustrate Peter and Caspian's conflict and Edmund's maturity, in an effort to tighten the script by using action as drama. Adamson preferred subtlety to the drama scenes, asking his young male actors not to perform angrily. Adamson copied Alfred Hitchcock by [...] "tell people {{at the end of the}} scene, 'Now just give <b>me</b> <b>something</b> where you're not thinking about anything.' By using it in context, the audience will read an emotion into it." ...|$|E
500|$|Sound collage group Negativland first sampled Reagan {{on their}} 1981 album Points on the {{instrumental}} track [...] "The Answer Is", where the music {{interrupted by the}} president stuttering, [...] "The problem isn't being poor, the problem is, uh... the answer is..." [...] The art rock band 3 Teens Kill 4 sampled Reagan and anecdotes about him in their 1984 song [...] "Tell <b>Me</b> <b>Something</b> Good". In 1985 P-Funk bassist Bootsy Collins and Jerry Harrison from Talking Heads teamed up as the supergroup Bonzo Goes to Washington (named for Reagan's early 1960s films Bedtime for Bonzo amd Bonzo Goes to College) to release a single that heavily sampled the president saying, [...] "My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that outlaws Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes," [...] during a microphone test. German Techno act Moskwa TV sampled the same phrase in the [...] "bombing mix" [...] of their 1985 dance track, [...] "Tekno Talk." ...|$|E
500|$|Will and Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) {{finalize}} their divorce. Attempting to {{deal with}} his sorrow and cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester's (Jane Lynch) incessant bullying, Will seduces Sue with a performance of [...] "Tell <b>Me</b> <b>Something</b> Good" [...] and asks her out on a date, standing her up to humiliate her. Sue withdraws the cheerleading squad from the upcoming Nationals competition and becomes bed-bound. Will sees the negative impact on the cheerleaders and realizes that some of them might lose their college scholarships. Will knows that hurting his nemesis did not make him feel any better, and encourages her to be there for her girls. Sue reenters and wins Nationals, but later gives Will two options: either house her new trophy inside New Directions' choir room, or kiss her. As Will is about to kiss her, Sue backs out and decides she prefers that the trophy be set up in the choir room as a reminder of her superiority.|$|E

500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I can hear you knocking at the front door/ And I know exactly what you came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give <b>me</b> <b>something</b> to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out." [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy" [...] referencing her first singles [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998) and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone (2003) and Circus (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000). The [...] "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" [...] was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.|$|E
500|$|Trescothick {{used the}} {{time to prepare for}} the {{following}} series in South Africa, even took up yoga in attempt to bolster his performances abroad. In December 2004, he made 85 not out against an N.F. Oppenheimer XI in South Africa. A partnership of 152 with Strauss in the opening Test against South Africa was followed by a partnership of 273 in the second, in which they both scored over 130. This was a record opening partnership at Durban and England's first 200 opening stand since Gooch and Mike Atherton in 1991. Before this, the difference between his home and abroad average was over 20, and his third overseas century went a long way to counter this. With regard to his touring difficulties, Trescothick stated [...] "I wouldn't say I've put it to rest, but I've made a big step forward to putting it to rest. It's a mental battle for <b>me,</b> <b>something</b> I have to deal with and work hard to try to understand what is different. He made a further improvement with an even larger score of 180, as England won the fourth Test. After batting slowly with Ashley Giles, the fall of Hoggard's wicket soon afterwards spurred Trescothick to start [...] "unleashing ferocious shots", setting up an unlikely victory with Steve Harmison partnering him. In the matches preceding the 2005 Ashes series, England wrapped up two easy victories against Bangladesh. Trescothick scored 194 in the first Test, and 151 in the second. He also scored 100 not out against Bangladesh in his 100th ODI, surpassing Gooch's record of eight ODI centuries for England.|$|E
