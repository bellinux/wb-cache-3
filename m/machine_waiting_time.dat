40|$|A {{group of}} {{identical}} NC machines, {{laid out in}} a line, manufactures relatively few part types in large batch size. Parts of the same type are processed by the machines simultaneously. The operations on a part are performed by one machine only, using a part type specific tool set. During batch production the tool magazines of the machines contain the same set of tools. If the machine group is provided with an automatic tool transport system then tools can be shared. Therefore, the number of identical tools can be reduced and savings with respect to investment in tools are possible. A disadvantage of tool sharing is that machines might become idle because tools have not arrived in time. Suitable dispatching and scheduling of the tool transportation device can reduce these <b>machine</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>times.</b> In this paper the characteristics of the production situation are examined. The consequences of three tool transport policies with respect to transport time and transport frequency of the transportation device are analyzed.

This queueing system {{consists of an}} upstream batch process machine and a downstream single process <b>machine.</b> The <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> of each job in the downstream queue is constrained by an upper limit. Violation of this upper limit causes scrap of the job. A batch machine poses {{a problem for the}} two-stage system under PQT constraints.

This increases the variance of downstream queue length and the probability of scrap. In this research, we incorporate dynamic programming algorithm in batch process admission control (BPAC) model. The performance of BPAC model is verified by simulation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BPAC model outperforms other methods in every key system performance indices. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the era of}} Cloud Computing, Big Data, and Quantum Physics Simulations, {{data centers}} play in the world ICT {{infrastructure}} a role as big as (sadly) their power consumption. In many cases, a surpris-ing amount of such consumption is due to idle resources, either intro-duced to face workload peaks or leftovers of workload fragmentation. In this context, proactive workload dispatching has the chance to improve the utilization of computing resources, thus reducing the idle time and improving the ability to handle peaks. In this paper, we devise a CP based approach for proactive workload dispatching on the EURORA su-percomputer placed at the CINECA computing center in Bologna. The new system is evaluated on simulated job traces, where it leads to re-markable improvements {{in terms of both}} <b>machine</b> utilization and <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for queued jobs with respect to the currently used dispatcher, i. e., Portable Batch System (PBS). ...|$|R

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. In queuing systems, <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and {{idle time}} are {{considered}} nonproductive since <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> limits opportunities to improve productivity, while idle time creates wasteful operation costs. Bulk cement loading {{process is a}} good example to illustrate the problem in logistics distribution system. Reduction of <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and throughput time of cement trucks in cement loading process requires such additional resources as loading machines and operators, which trade off additional operation costs for cement distributors; however, an abundant number of input resources could create idle time. On the other hand, minimizing the input resources can significantly save costs for entrepreneurs; however, <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and throughput time of trucks could be excessive that limits the number of trips that trucks could travel to transport cement. To maximize utilities of cement trucks and input resources, a trade-off between truck <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and server idle time needs to be resolved. The current practice yields average <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> of 26. 0 minutes per truck and throughput time of 71. 5 minutes per truck. According to the survey conducted by the plant, the current practice reflects the declining in customer satisfaction since the throughput time is high. To say, the current practice causes, on average, 47. 5 minutes of non-productive time per truck, compared to 24. 0 minutes of cement loading time. Consequently, simulations need to be performed for the sake of determining some balance between truck <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and idle time of servers. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} develop a simulation model that maximizes the utilization factor of truck <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and <b>machine</b> idle time in cement loading process. In addition, among the models showing maximum utilization factor, the study aims to pick up the potential model that can reduce truck <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and queue length, with as lowest machine idle time as possible. By using EZStrobe software, the current approach of the cement loading process was simulated based on the data obtained between August 2012 and June 2013. Model validation was performed by comparing results from the process simulation model with the results obtained from statistics to indicate accuracy of the simulation approach before proceeding to making improvements on the model. Various simulation models were developed by adjusting the process and allocating resources to predict total costs, average idle time of loading <b>machines,</b> average <b>waiting</b> <b>time,</b> average queue length, and average throughput time of trucks for each model. Sensitivity analysis were performed to determine the best practice that yields the greatest utilization factor and improve the overall performance of the process by minimizing truck <b>waiting</b> <b>time,</b> queue length, and machine idle time, with reasonable corresponding cost. The research was conducted based on a case study of the cement loading system at Asia Cement Plant by using population data collected during August 2012 -June 2013. The current model and improved simulation models, alongside with their results, were graphically and numerically presented to illustrate potential of the models in terms of maximizing the utilization factor. In addition, in-depth analyses were performed on the raw data to determine appropriate statistical distributions and characteristics for all parameters used in the simulation models...|$|R

We evaluated the effects of such a program in a community with two ED sites. METHODS: Descriptive statistics for <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> of the two sites before and after the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information were used to evaluate the effects of the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information on <b>wait</b> <b>times.</b> Multivariate logistical regression was used to test whether or not individual patients used published <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> to decide which site to visit. RESULTS: We found that the rates of <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> exceeding 4 h, and the 95 th percentile of <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> in the two sites decreased after the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information, even though the average <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> experienced a slight increase. We also found that after controlling for other factors, the site with shorter <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> had a higher likelihood of being selected after the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information, but there was no such relationship before the publication. CONCLUSIONS: These findings were consistent with the hypothesis that the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information leads to patients selecting the site with shorter <b>wait</b> <b>time.</b> While publishing ED <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information did not improve average <b>wait</b> <b>time,</b> it reduced the rates of lengthy <b>wait</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background Developments in the {{manufacturing}} environment such as shifting markets, emerging technologies and increasing competition require fundamental changes. One aspect is {{the integration of the}} activities process planning and process scheduling with the objective to balance resource loading, avoid bottlenecks and lower resource utilization. Method One approach to integrate process planning and scheduling is computer simulation. A manufacturing process of Supreme Precision Manufacturing Co., Ltd. is analysed by the use of a hybrid simulation model. Agent-based modeling and discrete event simulation are combined to investigate the impact of alternating set ups on the process. Different levels of flexibility, different decision criteria and different queuing principles are introduced into the model {{with the use of the}} software AnyLogic. Results The quantitative results show that a dynamic process is able to produce more output with shorter processing times per unit than a static process in the same period. Additionally, the machines in a dynamic process are more utilized and the <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> per unit are shorter. Furthermore, it is more effective to base a decision for or against an alternative machine on the current queue length, rather than the average queue length or the machine utilization, as these processes provide better results in terms of output, processing time per unit, <b>machine</b> utilization and <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> per unit. Last but not least, as soon as some flexibility is intro-duced into the process, a process applying LIFO queuing principles is more efficient than one applying FIFO. Conclusion The results confirm with theoretical goals and objectives of an efficient schedul-ing activity such as minimizing average flow time or maximizing machine utilization as pointed out by Tan and Khoshnevis (2000). However, the results are very case sensitive, which means it is difficult to make general assumptions or conclusions for other manufactur-ing environments or processes based on these results...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: In Spain, {{official}} information on <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for surgery {{is based on}} the interval between the indication for surgery and its performance. We aimed to estimate total <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for surgical procedures, including outpatient visits and diagnostic tests prior to surgery. In addition, we propose an alternative system to manage total <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> that reduces variability and maximum <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> without increasing the use of health care resources. This system is illustrated by three surgical procedures: cholecystectomy, carpal tunnel release and inguinal/femoral hernia repair. Methods: Using data from two Autonomous Communities, we adjusted, through simulation, a theoretical distribution of the total <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> assuming independence of the <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> of each stage of the clinical procedure. We show an alternative system in which the <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> for the second consultation is established according to the <b>time</b> previously <b>waited</b> for the first consultation. Results: Average total <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for cholecystectomy, carpal tunnel release and inguinal/femoral hernia repair were 331, 355 and 137 days, respectively (official data are 83, 68 and 73 days, respectively). Using different negative correlations between <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for subsequent consultations would reduce maximum <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> by between 2 % and 15 % and substantially reduce heterogeneity among patients, without generating higher resource use.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Prior {{research}} shows that clinical demand and supplier capacity significantly affect the throughput and the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> within an isolated unit. However, it is doubtful whether characteristics (i. e., demand, capacity, throughput, and <b>wait</b> <b>time)</b> of one unit would affect the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of subsequent units on the patient flow process. Focusing on cardiac care, this paper aims to {{examine the impact of}} characteristics of the catheterization unit (CU) on the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of cardiac surgery unit (SU). METHODS: This study integrates published data from several sources on characteristics of the CU and SU units in 11 hospitals in Ontario, Canada between 2005 and 2008. It proposes a two-layer <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> model (with each layer representing one unit) to examine the impact of CU's characteristics on the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of SU and test the hypotheses using the Partial Least Squares-based Structural Equation Modeling analysis tool. RESULTS: Results show that: (i) <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of CU has a direct positive impact on <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of SU (Î² = 0. 330, p < 0. 01); (ii) capacity of CU has a direct positive impact on demand of SU (Î² = 0. 644, p < 0. 01); (iii) within each unit, there exist significant relationships among different characteristics (except for the effect of throughput on <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> in SU). CONCLUSION: Characteristics of CU have direct and indirect impacts on <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of SU. Specifically, demand and <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of preceding unit are good predictors for <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of subsequent units. This suggests that considering such cross-unit effects is necessary when alleviating <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> in a health care system. Further, different patient risk profiles may affect <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> in different ways (e. g., positive or negative effects) within SU.
