The Szentendre, Ráckeve and Csepel lines are slated to be merged into {{what is called the}} metro line 5 (North-South Regional rapid railway). The connection will be made by an underground line between the Kaszásdűlő and Lágymányosi bridge stations, and extended in order to reach the center of Pesterzsébet. The Urban and Suburban Transit Association (Városi és Elővárosi Közlekedési Egyesület) has presented a plan to <b>merge</b> <b>line</b> 2 with the HÉV from Gödöllő. The city government did not totally accept the plan, but it still may be built after 2015.|$|E
30|$|We {{recall that}} DAC ’s {{training}} has split the dataset in N partitions and runs a CAP-growth over each partition, thus generating an ensemble of N models. These models are the input {{for the model}} consolidation algorithm (Algorithm 3). We reduce the models by applying, recursively two by two, a function <b>merge</b> (<b>line</b> 3). This function simply makes the union of the rules in the two models (line 8) and, for each set of identical (in the antecedent and consequent) rules found, applies function aggregate (line 11).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a Road Detection and Classification algorithm for Driver Assistance Systems (DAS), which tracks several road lanes and identifies {{the type of}} lane boundaries. The algorithm uses an edge filter to extract the longitudinal road markings to which a straight lane model is fitted. Next, the type of right and left lane boundaries (continuous, broken or <b>merge</b> <b>line)</b> is identified using a Fourier analysis. Adjacent lanes are searched when broken or merge lines are detected. Although {{the knowledge of the}} line type is essential for a robust DAS, it has been seldom considered in previous works. This knowledge helps to guide the search for other lanes, and it is the basis to identify the type of road (one-way, two-way or freeway), as well as {{to tell the difference between}} allowed and forbidden maneuvers, such as crossing a continuous line. ...|$|E

40|$|A global magnetospheric {{model is}} {{described}} {{with a single}} subsolar <b>merging</b> <b>line</b> whose position is determined neither locally by the relative orientations and strengths of the merging fields nor globally by the orientation of a separator line (the governing parameters of most previous models) but by the condition of tangential contact between the external field and the magnetopause. Attention {{is given to the}} case of finite leakage and partial penetration, which distort the IMF into a draped pattern, thus changing the locus of tangency to the sphere. In the special case where the penetrating IMF flux is balanced by an equal amount of earth flux leakage, the tangent <b>merging</b> <b>line</b> bisects the angle between the IMF and earth's northward subsolar field. This result is identical to the local <b>merging</b> <b>line</b> model result for merging fields with equal magnitude. Here, a global flux balance condition replaces the local equal magnitude condition...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} (Crooker, 1979) that the geomagnetic field and the merge at the dayside magnetopause along lines formed by the loci of points where the fields are antiparallel. These antiparallel <b>merging</b> <b>lines</b> curve outward from the cusps, one in each hemisphere. Here a three-dimensional magnetopause model in which the antiparallel <b>merging</b> <b>lines</b> become chains of neutral points is described. The model is constructed by overlapping shielding currents of the geomagnetic field and the IMF in a layer of finite thickness. The global topology of the model explains the observed disappearance of flux-transfer events when the IMF turns northward and the dearth of flux-transfer events in the subsolar region...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the approximation solution method of production rate in merge automatic transfer lines which are installed when L different parts are machined and assembled. In this method, the rate is estimated from the L 2 -stdge series lines into which the <b>merge</b> <b>line</b> is decomposed, so the line machining and assembling any number of parts are analyzed. From the comparison between the solutions obtained by the presented method and the Markov model, {{it appears that the}} error is very small. Furthermore, from the numerical analysis, it is presented that the production capacity of the assembly stage has a larger effect on the rate than that of machining stages, and that the rate is higher when the capacity of the assembly stage is a little larger than that of machining stages than when both stages have equal capacity...|$|E

40|$|In a thin {{elongated}} current sheet, it {{is likely}} that more than one X-line forms and thus multiple magnetic islands are produced. The islands are then subject to merging. By simulating such a case with a two-dimensional full-particle code, we show that a merger forming a large island produces the most energetic electron population in the system. By setting the lateral extent of the simulation box to be as large as ∼ 100 ion inertial lengths, we introduce many (16) small islands in the initial thin current sheet (∼ 1 ion inertial length thickness). Merging of these islands proceeds to leave only two islands in the system. Then, strong electron acceleration is seen upon the final merger that produces the single island in the large simulation box. The most energetic electrons in the system are accelerated at the <b>merging</b> <b>line.</b> The <b>merging</b> <b>line</b> acceleration dominates because the reverse-reconnection facilitating the final merger is in such a strongly driven manner that the associated electric field is an order of magnitude larger than those available upon normal reconnection. Combining the results from additional runs enables us to obtain a scaling law, which suggests a non-negligible role played by <b>merging</b> <b>lines</b> in the observed electron acceleration phenomena...|$|R

40|$|The system size {{dependence}} of electron acceleration during large-scale magnetic island coalescence is studied via a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation. Using a simulation box that {{is larger than}} those used in previous studies, injection by <b>merging</b> <b>line</b> acceleration and subsequent reacceleration inside a merged island {{are found to be}} the mechanisms for producing the most energetic electrons. This finding and knowledge of the reacceleration process enable us to predict that the high energy end of the electron energy spectrum continues to expand as the merged island size increases. Both the <b>merging</b> <b>line</b> acceleration and the reacceleration within a merged island require the island coalescence process to be so dynamic as to involve fast in-flow toward the center of a merged island. Once this condition is met in an early stage of the coalescence, it is likely to stay in the subsequent phase. In other words, if the thin elongated current sheet is initially able to host the dynamic magnetic island coalescence process, it will be a site where repeated upgrades in the maximum energy of electrons occur in a systematic manner...|$|R
