50|$|Steroids seem {{to relieve}} the {{symptoms}} but long term treatment <b>may</b> be <b>required.</b> Other immunosuppressants appear to be less effective. Surgery may be curative in ~40% but a second operation <b>may</b> be <b>required</b> later.|$|R
5|$|Sleep hygiene is {{a central}} {{component}} of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Sleep hygiene recommendations {{have been shown to}} reduce or eliminate the symptoms of insomnia. Specific sleep disorders <b>may</b> <b>require</b> other or additional treatment approaches, and continuing difficulties with sleep <b>may</b> <b>require</b> additional assistance from healthcare providers.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{scientific}} discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides {{in understanding the}} nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. Answers to these <b>may</b> <b>require</b> the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.|$|E
5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns <b>may</b> <b>require</b> prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns <b>may</b> <b>require</b> cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E

5|$|Complicated UTIs {{are more}} {{difficult}} to treat and usually requires more aggressive evaluation, treatment and follow-up. It <b>may</b> <b>require</b> identifying and addressing the underlying complication. Increasing antibiotic resistance is causing concern about the future of treating those with complicated and recurrent UTI.|$|E
5|$|Furry {{conventions}} {{are usually}} run and staffed by volunteers, though venues <b>may</b> <b>require</b> certain activities to be contracted out. Event funding typically relies on convention registrations. Many {{of the larger}} conventions are incorporated as non-profit organizations, usually to achieve tax-exempt status and safeguard the organizers' personal assets - in the US, some are 501(c)(3) charities, while others are registered as recreational clubs. The largest events <b>may</b> <b>require</b> up to a hundred volunteers, not including gofers. Volunteers are thanked for their participation during the closing ceremonies, which are usually well-attended, and often receive T-shirts or other benefits.|$|E
5|$|Infants <b>may</b> <b>require</b> iron {{supplements}} {{if they are}} bottle-fed cow's milk. Frequent blood donors {{are at risk of}} low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{on the law}} in the jurisdiction, the {{prosecution}} <b>may</b> be <b>required</b> to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not entrapped or the defendant <b>may</b> be <b>required</b> to prove that they were entrapped as an affirmative defence.|$|R
5000|$|Justification of {{the budget}} request <b>may</b> be <b>required</b> in writing. In most cases, the manager talks with their {{administrative}} officers about budget requirements. Adjustments to the budget submission <b>may</b> be <b>required</b> {{as a result of}} this phase in the process.|$|R
50|$|A {{marriage}} certificate <b>may</b> be <b>required</b> {{for a number}} of reasons. It <b>may</b> be <b>required</b> as evidence of change of a party's name, on issues of legitimacy of a child, during divorce proceedings, or as part of a genealogical history, besides other purposes.|$|R
5|$|It is {{typically}} thought {{to affect the}} big toe, but it affects {{other parts of the}} feet as well, including the bottom of the foot (plantar surface). The occurrence of purple toe syndrome <b>may</b> <b>require</b> discontinuation of warfarin.|$|E
5|$|Lactic {{acidosis}} {{is initially}} treated with sodium bicarbonate, although high doses are not recommended, as this may increase intracellular acidosis. Acidosis {{that does not}} respond to administration of sodium bicarbonate <b>may</b> <b>require</b> further management with standard hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration.|$|E
5|$|Some {{countries}} closely {{regulate the}} industry (and <b>may</b> <b>require</b> anyone {{working on an}} ambulance to be qualified to a set level), whereas others allow quite wide differences between types of operator.|$|E
50|$|Other {{physical}} feats <b>may</b> be <b>required,</b> such as calisthenics {{and other}} physical tests, such as mud wrestling, forming a human pyramid, or climbing a greased pole. Exposure {{to the elements}} <b>may</b> be <b>required,</b> such as swimming or diving in cold water or snow.|$|R
5000|$|In some high-security environments, one <b>may</b> be <b>required</b> {{to use a}} {{degausser}} {{that has}} been approved for the task. For example, in US government and military jurisdictions, one <b>may</b> be <b>required</b> to use a degausser from the NSA's [...] "Evaluated Products List".|$|R
50|$|While {{gathering}} information, shoppers usually {{blend in}} as regular shoppers {{at the store}} being evaluated. They <b>may</b> be <b>required</b> to take photographs or measurements, return purchases, or {{count the number of}} products, seats, people during the visit. A timer or a stopwatch <b>may</b> be <b>required.</b>|$|R
5|$|Successful birch {{cultivation}} {{requires a}} climate cool enough {{for at least}} the occasional winter snowfall. As they are shallow-rooted, they <b>may</b> <b>require</b> water during dry periods. They grow best in full sun planted in deep, well-drained soil.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{includes}} a healthy diet, salt restriction, and exercise. Bariatric surgery {{may also be}} used to help with weight loss. The medication acetazolamide may also be used along with the above measures. A small percentage of people <b>may</b> <b>require</b> surgery to relieve the pressure.|$|E
5|$|A {{transmission}} line {{is required to}} bring the generated power to (often remote) markets. For an off-shore station this <b>may</b> <b>require</b> a submarine cable. Construction of a new high-voltage line may be too costly for the wind resource alone, but wind sites may take advantage of lines installed for conventionally fueled generation.|$|E
30|$|In the AoS {{group of}} GPU {{implementations}} described above, the data structure for representing 3 D points is not {{forced to be}} aligned. Operations using the misaligned structure <b>may</b> <b>requires</b> much more memory transactions when accessing global memory, and thus decreases the overall efficiency performance (NVIDIA 2015).|$|R

5|$|Because Clumber Spaniels {{are large}} boned and fast growing, they can suffer from {{temporary}} lameness from between six and twelve months of age, with this lameness subsiding when bone growth is complete. Another common condition that the breed suffers from are impacted anal sacs {{and the dog}} <b>may</b> <b>require</b> them to be emptied by a veterinarian. The final common condition that the breed has is heat sensitivity: if Clumber Spaniels are left without shade, they can become uncomfortably hot and dehydrated.|$|E
5|$|Cannabis {{can be a}} {{contributory}} {{factor in}} schizophrenia, potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk. The increased risk <b>may</b> <b>require</b> the presence of certain genes within an individual or {{may be related to}} preexisting psychopathology. Early exposure is strongly associated with an increased risk. The size of the increased risk is not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis. Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses.|$|E
5|$|Drives which encrypt all {{writes on}} the fly can {{implement}} ATA Secure Erase in another way. They simply zeroize and generate a new random encryption key each time a secure erase is done. In this way the old data cannot be read anymore, as it cannot be decrypted. Some drives with an integrated encryption <b>may</b> <b>require</b> a TRIM command {{be sent to the}} drive to put the drive back to its original out-of-box state.|$|E
