40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} integral role <b>manners</b> played in Willa Cather 2 ̆ 7 s life and fiction. She simultaneously longed for and distrusted the social polish of proper <b>manners.</b> Cather understood {{the centrality of}} <b>manners</b> to human relationships, but she also recognized their potential to damage and silence. ^ The first chapter introduces Cather 2 ̆ 7 s life-long engagement with <b>manners.</b> The second and third chapters examine Cather 2 ̆ 7 s childhood scrapbook and her work as {{managing editor of the}} Home Monthly, to identify the prescriptive and conflicting nature of Cather 2 ̆ 7 s early interaction with <b>manners.</b> In The Song of the Lark, the focus of the fourth chapter, Cather addresses <b>manners</b> directly by rewriting the traditional novel of <b>manners,</b> subverting the marriage plot and creating an independent and talented heroine who can learn, interpret, critique, and transform <b>manners</b> to create her own code of behavior. In My Antonia, the subject of the fifth chapter, Cather fully democratizes <b>manners,</b> by inserting the silenced narrative of the hired girls, to produce the American novel of <b>manners.</b> Chapter six presents A Lost Lady as a postscript to Cather 2 ̆ 7 s American novel of <b>manners,</b> exploring what happens when society begins to disintegrate and <b>manners</b> no longer have a foundation to support them. The seventh chapter outlines Cather 2 ̆ 7 s continued engagement with <b>manners</b> in her later novels. ^ After working within the commercial construct of <b>manners</b> in her scrapbook and at the Home Monthly, Cather democratizes <b>manners</b> by rewriting the traditional novel of <b>manners</b> in The Song of the Lark and then creating her own American novel of <b>manners</b> in My Antonia, a version that included both broader opportunities for women and direct participation by all members of society. In A Lost Lady, her postscript to the American novel of <b>manners,</b> Cather points to the redefinition of <b>manners</b> in commercial terms and explores what happens when <b>manners</b> no longer have the society to support them. ...|$|R
