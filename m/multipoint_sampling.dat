40|$|Potential causalities due to {{airborne}} disease {{transmission and}} risk of chem-bio terrorism in commercial airliner cabins can be reduced by fast responses. Fast responses are only possible by using sensors at appropriate locations in the cabins. Cost, size and weight factors restrict the number of sensors that could be installed inside a cabin. Since release locations and seating patterns of passengers can impact airborne contaminant transports, this study first addressed this impact by using a validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program in a four-row mockup of twin-aisle airliner cabin. It was observed that occupancy patterns and release locations have little influence on longitudinal contaminant transports though localized variations of contaminant concentrations may exist. The results show that response time of the sensors is considerably reduced {{with the increase in}} number of sensors. If only a single sensor is available across a cabin cross-section then it should be placed at the middle of the ceiling. A cabin model of a fully occupied twin-aisle airliner with 210 seats was also build to study the diverse contaminant distribution trends along cabin length. The results reveal that seating arrangements can make cross sectional airflow pattern considerably asymmetrical. Similar airflow patterns make the longitudinal contaminant transport in the business and economy classes alike. The presence of galleys greatly affected the longitudinal transport of contaminants in a particular cabin section. The effects due to galleys were less significant if a <b>multipoint</b> <b>sampling</b> system was used. The <b>multipoint</b> <b>sampling</b> system can also reduce the number of sensors required in a cabin...|$|E

Airflow rates between the two zones were measured using a tracer-gas decay technique, and the temperature at the centre of each zone was measured using thermocouples. Zone 1 was heated to various temperatures in the range 18 - 38 Â°C using thermostatically controlled heaters. Zone 2 was unheated. A <b>multipoint</b> <b>sampling</b> unit was used to collect a tracer-gas sample from each zone. The concentration of SF 6 tracer was measured using an infra-red gas analyzer. The heat and mass flow rates between the two zones were calculated from the tracer-gas concentrations and temperature differences.

40|$|Stepwise {{uncertainty}} reduction (SUR) strategies aim at {{constructing a}} sequence of points for evaluating a function[*] f {{in such a way}} that the residual uncertainty about a quantity of interest progressively decreases to zero. Using such strategies in the framework of Gaussian process modeling has been shown to be efficient for estimating the volume of excursion of f above a fixed threshold. However, SUR strategies remain cumbersome to use in practice because of their high computational complexity, and the fact that they deliver a single point at each iteration. In this article we introduce several <b>multipoint</b> <b>sampling</b> criteria, allowing the selection of batches of points at which f can be evaluated in parallel. Such criteria are of particular interest when f is costly to evaluate and several CPUs are simultaneously available. We also manage to drastically reduce the computational cost of these strategies through the use of closed form formulas. We illustrate their performances in various numerical experiments, including a nuclear safety test case.

When daily samples were analyzed, energy expenditure was 2859 ± 453 kcal/d (1 ± SD); when only the first and last time points were considered, the mean calculated energy ex-penditure was not significantly different (2947 ± 430 kcal/d). An analysis oftheoretical cases in which isotope flux is not con-stant indicates that the multipoint method can cause errors in the calculation of average isotope fluxes, but these are generally small. Simulations of the effect of analytical error indicate that increasing the number of replicates on two points reduces the impact oftechnical errors more effectively than does performing single analyses on multiple samples. It appears that generally there is no advantage to collecting frequent samples when the 2 H 215 O method is used to estimate energy expenditure in adult humans. Am J C/in Nuir 1 990; 52 : I 134 - 8.

Knowledge has long been recognized as a crucial competitive tool for organizational survival and competition. Further, business leaders must implement learning into the business for it to grow and survive. Capturing, converting, and integrating knowledge into the business is a requisite for business survival and represents an important line of inquiry. Since 2002, small businesses have accounted for more than 99 % of all businesses and for 63 % of net new jobs between 1993 and 2011. Since 2007, failure rates of small businesses have increased 40 %. In California alone, more than 3 million small businesses exist, contributing 37 % to the California GDP. The current research was used to add to the body of knowledge on learning and survivability using a multisite case study involving specifically small businesses within San Diego County, California, and answered the research question about how small businesses leaders implement a process to capture, convert, and integrate knowledge for the business to survive.

The objectives {{of the study were}} to evaluate the comfort and ventilation conditions produced by a conventional ceiling supply-and-return air distribution system in workstations separated by (1) solid partitions of different height (75 in. [1. 9 m], 65 in. [1. 65 m], 42 in. [1. 1 m], and 0 in. [partitions removed]) and (2) partitions containing a gap positioned {{at the bottom of the}} partition. The project consisted primarily of experiments performed in a full-scale controlled environment chamber (CEC) which a typical modular office environment was set up. The range of partition configurations and environmental parameters investigated included (1) partition height, (2) solid vs. airflow partitions, (3) airflow gap size, (4) supply air volume, (5) supply~room temperature difference, (6) supply diffuser location, (7) heat loud density, (8) workstation size, and (9) cooling vs. heating mode. Under steady-state conditions, multipoint measurements were made of air velocities, air temperatures, and radiant (globe) temperatures to characterize the key environmental variables affecting thermal comfort, and tracer gas methods using <b>multipoint</b> <b>sampling</b> locations were employed to determine the ventilation performance within the test chamber. The results indicated that variations in solid partition height produce only small differences in overall thermal and ventilation performance. Results also showed that while the existence of an airflow opening at the bottom of office partitions can, in some cases, produce slight increases in air velocities near the floor, there are no significant improvements in comfort conditions or ventilation efficiency within the workstations compared to results obtained for solid partitions.

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF AMNA E. ELGUZOULI, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} ZOOLOGY, {{presented}} on May 8, 2012, at Southern Illinois University TITLE: Mitochondrial DNA sequence {{variation in the}} African Armyworm Spodoptera exempta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) MAJOR PROFESSOR: Kamal M. Ibrahim The African Armyworm remains problematic as a serious pest of cereals in sub-Sahara Africa. The population genetic structure of African armyworms was investigated {{to better understand the}} species 2 ̆ 7 population dynamics {{and the extent to which}} the two major outbreak areas in East Africa and Southern Africa are linked by gene flow. Specifically, I characterized the genetic variation of armyworm samples from Tanzania and South Africa and assessed whether the periodic swarming of armyworms homogenizes populations throughout the species range. The variability of a range of mitochondrial genes was screened. A 413 base pair long fragment of the Cytochrome Oxidase I gene (COI), located within positions 1688 to 2175 of the reference locust mitochondrial genome was found to be an ideal marker. This sequence is part of the Folmer region of the COI gene that is used as a 2 ̆ 7 barcode 2 ̆ 7 for all animal taxa. Haplotype diversity was found to be comparable to reports in the Spruce Budworm (Choristoneuru fumiferana), which, like the African armyworm, undergoes sporadic population buildup. The sequences were A+T rich particularly at the first codon position confirming previous findings in other insect species. ii A population genetic analysis of the sequence variation revealed that African armyworm populations are genetically structured and do not form a single panmictic population. Despite the limited sampling in this study, a clear picture of significant genetic separation between Tanzanian and South African armyworm populations has been confirmed. This leads to the conclusion that the extent of mixing resulting from the well documented tracking of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone by outbreak populations does not connect Tanzanian and South Africa armyworm populations. Many rare haplotypes that are one mutation step from one of two common haplotypes were observed; a parsimony based haplotype network supports the hypothesis that these rare haplotype may have arisen during the regional population expansions. However, because the southern and northern regions that were sampled share the same two common haplotypes, neither the phylogenetic trees nor the haplotype networks yielded geographic signal that show where the rare haplotypes may have evolved. The presence of many unique singleton haplotypes, coupled with the pattern of their mismatch distribution, suggests exponential growth of localized armyworm populations. Outbreak populations arise separately in different locations across the species geographic distribution; it appears that the sizes of these populations become large enough for new mutations to produce new variants in each location. The fact that the two commonest haplotypes were present both in South Africa and in Tanzania indicates that some exchange of migrants does take place between the two regions. Alternatively, since the haplotypes that are unique to each region are derived from, and a single mutation step away from, these two common haplotypes, this could indicate that the two common haplotypes were shared in the ancestral populations and that no current gene flow takes iii place. In either case, it is apparent that the periodic swarming of armyworms does not homogenize the entire species range. What are the implications of these findings to the control of armyworm infestations? Armyworm population dynamics in the species 2 ̆ 7 northern range appears to be decoupled from its population dynamics in the south. This implies that this pest 2 ̆ 7 s control strategies need to be region specific. However, this study had only two sampling points. It is plausible that a stepping-stone type of link exists in between and that I have sampled the extreme northern and southern ends of the link. A finer scale, <b>multipoint</b> <b>sampling</b> throughout the species geographic range, preferably during multiple years, is required in order to answer this question unambiguously. This would assist in developing an outbreak early warning system and in determining if multi-region control strategy is warranted. I also draw attention to another caveat to the above conclusions: a significant proportion of the divergence between the two sampling localities is attributable to two rare but highly divergent haplotypes. The possibility of these two haplotypes belonging to another, as yet unknown moth species, has been discussed. In addition to the above insights, this study has assessed the utility of the large number of universal mtDNA primers in the study of armyworm population genetics...|$|E

40|$|In France, as {{in other}} countries, {{there is a need}} to improve {{knowledge}} of greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions from livestock production with various management options. The aim of this study was to quantify the NH 3, N 2 O, CO 2 and CH 4 emissions from two pig solid manure heaps, turned and not turned, in order to examine the effect of turning on gaseous emissions and to obtain additional information about emissions during composting in commercial conditions. The manure produced from the fattening of 72 pigs on straw bedding was divided between two identical heaps and stored outside on a concrete area for three months during autumn 2004. One heap was turned at day 0, 11 and 27. Gaseous emissions (NH 3, N 2 O, CH 4, CO 2, H 2 O) of both heaps, covered for the purpose by ventilated greenhouses, were continuously measured over four periods (57 days in total). The tracer method, using SF 6, was used to measure the ventilation rate in the greenhouses. Concentrations inside and outside the greenhouses (to have a differential) were measured by photoacoustic infrared absorption spectrometry with a gas analyser coupled to a <b>multipoint</b> <b>sampler</b> and closer. Emissions were calculated by combining various flows and differential concentrations and interpolated between the different measuring periods. Results show that emission kinetics were very similar for the two heaps, except after turning, when emissions are given a new impetus. On average, the measured gas emissions for unturned and turned heaps represent a nitrogen loss (mainly in the form of NH 3) of 10. 5 % and 9 % of the initial nitrogen, and a carbon loss (mainly in the form of CO 2) of 24 et 28 % of the initial carbon. For both heaps, N 2 O is the primary greenhouse gas emitted (3 % of the initial nitrogen) and not CO 2 or CH 4. Considering the uncertainty on the measurements and the representativity of the experiment, these results did not show any clear difference between the two heaps. They underlined the relationship between gaseous emissions and the initial product (dry matter > 30 %) and the diversity of the litters, which will be studied on the farm...|$|R

An on-farm instrumentation shelter houses the equipment for measuring pollutant concentrations at representative barn air inlets and outlets, barn airflows, operational processes and environmental variables. Sampling began in July 2007 with data logged every 15 s and 60 s; sampling will continue for 24 months in total. Data are retrieved with network-connected PC, formatted, and validated for calculations of emission rates. A <b>multipoint</b> air <b>sampling</b> system draws air sequentially from representative locations at the barns and delivers it to a manifold from which on-line gas analyzers draw their subsamples. Different size PM including total suspended particulate (TSP), PM 10 and PM 2. 5 are measured in real time using tapered element oscillating microbalances (TEOMs) and a Beta Gage PM analyzer. Mechanically-ventilated barn airflows are estimated by continuously measuring fan operational status and building static pressure, in combination with calibrated curves for each fan’s airflow. Specific processes that directly or indirectly influence barn emissions, including pig activity, manure management/handling and feeding, are measured. Environmental parameters including inside and outside air temperatures and humidity, wind speed and direction, and solar radiation are also monitored.

It {{is one of the most}} frequently diagnosed disorders in childhood, representing a major educational and social problem.

The etiological mechanisms remain elusive, however, despite being the focus of intensive multidisciplinary research. All attempts to map quantitative-trait loci (QTLs) influencing dyslexia susceptibility have targeted specific chromosomal regions, so that inferences regarding genetic etiology have been made on the basis of very limited information. Here we present the first two complete QTL-based genome-wide scans for this trait, in large samples of families from the United Kingdom and United States. Using single-point analysis, linkage to marker D 18 S 53 was independently identified as being one of the most significant results of the genome in each scan (P< or = 0. 0004 for single word-reading ability in each family <b>sample).</b> <b>Multipoint</b> analysis gave increased evidence of 18 p 11. 2 linkage for single-word reading, yielding top empirical P values of 0. 00001 (UK) and 0. 0004 (US).

N 2 O concentrations, representing exposure values, were monitored within proximity to staff with a spectrophotometric acoustic <b>multipoint</b> system. The <b>samples</b> of 45 endoscopic procedures, taken at the breathing area zone of the staff, to more heights and in more sampling points of endoscopy environments analyzed, have detected a mean of 450 ± 347 (standard deviation) ppm of nitrous oxide without scavenging system and a mean of 28 ± 55 ppm with double mask with a demand valve and portable gas evacuation system, significantly different values to the U Mann-Whitney test, with statistical significance p-value < 0. 001.
