40|$|Abstract. New {{feedstock}} formulation for metal {{injection moulding}} (MIM) of Molybdenum High Speed Steel (M 2 HSS) has been developed. The binder is a multicomponent system consisting of major binder paraffin wax (PW), stearic acid (SA) and minor binder polyethelene waste rubber (PEWR). Injection moulding was conducted successfully using a powder loading of 0. 65. Scanning electron micrograph of the green injection <b>moulded</b> <b>part</b> revealed homogenous distribution of the M 2 HSS particles in the wax matrix. Paraffin wax and stearic acid were driven off by immersing the injection <b>moulded</b> <b>part</b> into n-heptane for five hours. Vacuum sintering of the brown parts at a temperature range of 1240 °C- 1280 °C resulted in high quality M 2 HSS parts. The properties of the sintered part such as physical, mechanical and microstructure were studied and discussed to evaluate the influence of waste rubber in MIM of M 2 HSS...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel CAD feature recognition approach for thin-walled injection moulded and cast parts in which moulding features are recognised from a mid-surface abstraction {{of the part}} geometry. The motivation for the research has been to develop techniques to help designers of <b>moulded</b> <b>parts</b> to incorporate manufacturing considerations into their designs early in the design process. The main contribution of the research has been {{the development of an}} attributed mid- surface adjacency graph to represent the mid-surface topology and geometry, and a feature recognition methodology for moulding features. The conclusion of the research is that the mid-surface representation provides a better basis for feature recognition for <b>moulded</b> <b>parts</b> than a B-REP solid model. A demonstrator that is able to identify ribs, buttresses, bosses, holes and wall junctions has been developed using C++, with data exchange to the CAD system implemented using ISO 10303 STEP. The demonstrator uses a commercial algorithm (I-DEAS) to create the mid-surface representation, but the feature recognition approach is generic and could be applied to any mid-surface abstraction.
