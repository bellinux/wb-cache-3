5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E
25|$|However, {{unlike the}} music industry, where modern {{technology}} has allowed a fully professional product {{to be created}} extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment.

25|$|The {{feeling of}} {{cultural}} outrage was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> anti-Semitism as such; or rather, {{it turned into}} anti-Semites, at any rate for the moment, people who normally never expressed such feelings. It was he Jew-as-Iconoclast which aroused the really deep rage... Mahler had begun it; Schönberg carried it on; both were Jews, and they corrupted young Aryan composers like Berg - so the argument went.|$|E

50|$|Lady in the Spa (German:Madame im Strandbad) is a 1929 Austrian silent comedy film {{directed}} by Edmund Hahn and starring Maximilian Kraemer, Betty Bird and Helen von Münchofen.

25|$|The {{internal}} reforms under Khosrow were <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> {{those on}} the exterior frontier. The subsequent reforms resulted {{in the rise of}} a bureaucratic state {{at the expense of the}} great noble families, strengthening the central government and the power of the Shahanshah. The army too was reorganized and tied to the central government rather than local nobility allowing greater organization, faster mobilization and a far greater cavalry corps. Reforms in taxation provided the empire with stability and a much stronger economy, allowing prolonged military campaigns as well as greater revenues for the bureaucracy.|$|E
25|$|Sassoon {{expressed}} his {{opinions on the}} political situation {{before the onset of}} the First World War thus—"France was a lady, Russia was a bear, and performing in the county cricket team was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> either of them". Sassoon wanted to play for Kent County Cricket Club; Kent Captain Frank Marchant was a neighbour of Sassoon. Siegfried often turned out for Bluehouses at the Nevill Ground, Tunbridge Wells, where he sometimes played alongside Arthur Conan Doyle. He had also played cricket for his house at Marlborough College, once taking 7 wickets for 18 runs. Although an enthusiast, Sassoon was not good enough to play for Kent, but he played cricket for Matfield village, and later for the Downside Abbey team, continuing into his seventies.|$|E
25|$|When the {{division}} of Europe into two opposing camps became unavoidable, {{the threat of the}} Soviet Union became <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> concerns over German rearmament. Western Europe therefore sought a new mutual defence pact involving the United States. The United States recognized the growing threat of the USSR and was responsive to this concept. Secret meetings began by the end of March 1949 between American, Canadian and British officials to negotiate such a trans-Atlantic mutual defence pact. Eventually, it would lead to the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) with the North Atlantic Treaty signed in Washington, D.C. in 1949. NATO began forming its own military command structure in 1951, at which time the headquarters, personnel and plans of the WUDO were transferred to Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), and SHAPE took over responsibility for the defence of Western Europe.|$|E

25|$|From late June to mid-July, {{the king}} {{exchanged}} several letters with Hitler who, using an ultimatum-like tone, demanded that Carol make territorial concessions to Hungary and Bulgaria, promising to guarantee Romania's new borders. Gigurtu, accompanied by Manoilescu, met Hitler and Ribbentrop at Berghof on 26 July. The Germans recommended the Romanian side immediately satisfy Hungary's demands through proposals and direct negotiations. The following day, they met Duce Benito Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano in Rome, suggesting that negotiations with Hungary and Bulgaria should start with population exchanges, with the borders adjusted later. A key point of Gigurtu's mandate was {{to convince the}} Germans that Romania considered Transylvania <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> Bessarabia, a position stated by the premier in his August 27 letter to Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Nazi Minister of Foreign Affairs. In the face of pressure and threats from the Axis, separate negotiations took place with Hungary and Bulgaria in August; the former necessitated intervention by Germany and Fascist Italy and resulted {{in the loss of}} Northern Transylvania (see Second Vienna Award), while the latter led to the cession of Southern Dobruja and a population exchange in early September (see Treaty of Craiova).|$|E
25|$|After the battle, Alan Moorehead an Australian war correspondent, visited Nibeiwa {{after moving}} around {{destroyed}} lorries and Bren Carriers, which had run onto mines and past square {{holes in the}} ground, which had been dug for machine-gun posts. Dead lay around the fort and light tanks were at the west wall, where the Maletti Group had made its last stand. Other tanks were inside the camp facing in all directions. The capture of Nibeiwa camp {{cleared the way for}} the next stage of the British attack, when the remaining operational tanks and the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade moved west of the Tummar camps and the 16th Infantry Brigade closed up to the area vacated by the Indian brigade. The Western Desert Force completed the capture of the camps and captured Sidi Barrani, destroying two Italian divisions by 10 December as two more divisions were caught on the Mersa Matruh–Sidi Barrani road and forced to surrender. By the time that Sidi Barrani was captured on 11 December the WDF bag had increased to 38,300 prisoners, 73 tanks and 422 guns for a loss of 133 men killed, 387 wounded and eight missing. On 28 December, planning with photographs from reconnaissance aircraft and night patrol reports began for the capture of Bardia, which would not have the benefit of surprise like the attack on Nibeiwa, which had far less extensive defences and was too far from neighbouring camps to be supported. The defences of Bardia were reminiscent of the defensive structures used in the First World War and British artillery would be <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> at Nibeiwa. The experience of the attack there was important for the plan to use a combination of shock, firepower, tanks and the mobility of the Infantry tanks to break into the port defences.|$|E

After the name reversal, an Embassy spokeswoman said: [...] "our relations are definitely <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> potatoes... and our relations are back on track".|$|E
500|$|In this definition, Durkheim avoids {{references}} to supernatural or God. Durkheim {{argued that the}} concept of supernatural is relatively new, tied to the development of science and separation of supernatural—that which cannot be rationally explained—from natural, that which can. Thus, according to Durkheim, for early humans, everything was supernatural. Similarly, he points out that religions that give little importance to the concept of god exist, such as Buddhism, where the Four Noble Truths are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> any individual deity. With that, Durkheim argues, we are left with the following three concepts: the sacred (the ideas that cannot be properly explained, inspire awe and are considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion), the beliefs and practices (which create highly emotional state—collective effervescence—and invest symbols with sacred importance), and the moral community (a group of people sharing a common moral philosophy). Out of those three concepts, Durkheim focused on the sacred, noting that it is at the very core of a religion. He defined sacred things as: ...|$|E

30|$|Policies {{like the}} {{establishment}} of goals on the percentage of foreign students and recruitment of faculty with international experience have been implemented in many countries simultaneously. Similarly, stimulus to cross-cultural programmes, increasing on the academic mobility and more concerns about content on the curriculum, including intercultural and multicultural education are clear symptoms that these issues are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> today <b>than</b> {{they used to be}} considered a few decades before (Knight 1994).|$|R

2500|$|Another Anglican {{view was}} that of Randall Davidson, Temple's {{eventual}} successor as Archbishop of Canterbury. [...] He stressed [...] "the strength and depth of the Protestantism of England" [...] and regarded other differences with Rome as <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> its views on Anglican orders. This view {{seems to have been}} widely held at the time, judging from the reaction of Cardinal Herbert Vaughan, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster: he was somewhat surprised that the pope's decision was so well received in England.|$|E

2500|$|Capello {{arrived at}} a Real Madrid side in 2006, {{suffering}} {{one of the longest}} spells without a trophy in their history.

He said that results were <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> playing beautifully. He also added that [...] "those days are over". His remit was to bring the title back to Madrid, a task that had been too much for five other coaches since 2003.|$|E
2500|$|By the 16th century, Crawley's {{development}} into {{a thriving}} market village meant that its parish was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> that of Slaugham, and {{the connection between}} their two churches was legally severed.
