5|$|Due to {{the limited}} form of {{judicial}} review available under the ISA, whether a person remains under detention depends largely on the Ministry of Home Affairs. This raises the question quis custodiet ipsos custodes? – who guards the guardians? If preventive detention is applied illegitimately in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> cripples lawful democratic opposition, the absence of judicial review would preclude the exposure of such abuse. It has been submitted that the voice of public opinion is most suited for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Gale married Henrietta Roper, the {{daughter}} of Henry Roper of Cowling, Kent. She died in 1720. They had one son, Roger Henry Gale, {{who was born in}} 1710. Gale himself died on 25 June 1744 at his estates in Scruton, and was buried near the church there. There is no monument in the churchyard, as he stipulated in his will that he be buried in such a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> no one would know exactly where he was buried.|$|E

5|$|Methoxyflurane is an {{extremely}} potent and highly lipid-soluble anesthetic agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times. It is non-flammable, has relatively mild hemodynamic effects, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to rhythm disturbances. It is, however, a significant respiratory depressant. Methoxyflurane has powerful analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric analgesia, in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today.|$|E
5|$|Prions are {{infectious}} agents composed {{entirely of}} a protein material that can fold in multiple, structurally abstract ways, {{at least one}} of which is transmissible to other prion proteins, leading to disease in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> is epidemiologically comparable to the spread of viral infection. Prions composed of the prion protein (PrP) are believed to be the cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) among other diseases.|$|E
5|$|Python allows boolean {{expressions}} {{with multiple}} equality relations in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> {{is consistent with}} general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic ash {{not only}} affects {{in-flight}} operations but can affect ground-based airport operations as well. Small accumulations of ash can reduce visibility, create slippery runways and taxiways, infiltrate communication and electrical systems, interrupt ground services, damage buildings and parked aircraft. Ash accumulation {{of more than}} a few millimeters requires removal before airports can resume full operations. Ash does not disappear (unlike snowfalls) and must be disposed of in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> prevents it from being remobilised by wind and aircraft.|$|E

5|$|After World War I, {{traveling}} {{was once}} again possible for the many young artists who {{had been forced to}} stay home during the six years of war. In 1920, Jolin went on a journey, first to Italy, North Africa and Spain for new international impressions, and then on to India, Africa and the West Indies. In the spring of 1924, Jolin went to Spain with his first wife, Britt von Zweigbergk. Like many other artists he painted the bullfights, but contrary to the strong, and sometimes bloody, bullfight painted by his colleague and close friend Gösta Adrian-Nilsson (GAN), Jolin's works were created in the calm and orderly <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> had earned him his second nickname: Eleganten Einar (Einar, the Elegant).|$|E
5|$|Atchison {{remarked that}} his {{theme for the}} film, deemed an {{inspirational}} film, was about overcoming obstacles despite difficult challenges along the way. He {{also said that he}} wanted to portray African Americans in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> was not stereotypical and tried to show how African American children incorporate some stereotypes. The film alludes to the importance of community as well as to problems black communities face. It also deals with esteem and stigma in school while criticizes the public school system. Cast members said that although the film was aimed at children, they considered it had important lessons for the parents as well.|$|E
5|$|Bartholdi and Laboulaye {{considered}} {{how best}} to express the idea of American liberty. In early American history, two female figures were frequently used as cultural symbols of the nation. One of these symbols, the personified Columbia, {{was seen as an}} embodiment of the United States in the <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> Britannia was identified with the United Kingdom and Marianne came to represent France. Columbia had supplanted the earlier figure of an Indian princess, which had come to be regarded as uncivilized and derogatory toward Americans. The other significant female icon in American culture was a representation of Liberty, derived from Libertas, the goddess of freedom widely worshipped in ancient Rome, especially among emancipated slaves. A Liberty figure adorned most American coins of the time, and representations of Liberty appeared in popular and civic art, including Thomas Crawford's Statue of Freedom (1863) atop the dome of the United States Capitol Building.|$|E

However, they are {{followed}} by Grant, who kills Kerim Bey and a Soviet security officer. Grant pretends to be another British agent and meets Bond. Over dinner Grant drugs Romanova, then overcomes Bond. Bond tricks Grant into opening Bond's attaché case in the <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> detonates its tear gas booby trap, allowing Bond to attack and kill him. Bond and Romanova escape with the Lektor to Venice. Rosa Klebb, disguised as a hotel maid, attempts to steal the Lektor and kill Bond, but ends up being shot by Romanova.|$|E
5|$|During a {{press conference}} about {{the success of the}} recent Pawnee harvest festival, city manager Paul (Phil Reeves) suffers a massive heart attack. Chris (Rob Lowe) accepts an offer to work as acting city manager while Paul recovers from bypass surgery. Chris {{requests}} of Leslie (Amy Poehler) more large-scale ideas to generate revenue, placing pressure on her to follow up the harvest festival, so she organizes a camping trip for the parks department to discuss ideas. Ann (Rashida Jones) feels awkward now that Chris is back; the two previously dated, but Chris broke up with Ann in such a friendly <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> she did not initially realize it was a break-up. Leslie invites Ann to the camping trip to help her feel better.|$|E
5|$|For {{a general}} system, states are {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, {{the effects of a}} single measurement can influence other parts of a system in a <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> is described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization for pure states.|$|E
