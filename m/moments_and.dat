In 2002, the match was ranked at number 15 in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Sporting <b>Moments,</b> <b>and</b> in 2007 Thomas's goal was voted the second {{greatest}} moment in Arsenal's history (second to completing an entire league season unbeaten in 2004). To commemorate the 20th {{anniversary of the}} win, Arsenal's away kit for the 2008–09 season was styled on the same design {{as that of the}} 1988–89 season.|$|E
5|$|The first sixteen {{episodes of}} the season aired on Tuesdays at 9:00pm ET in the United States, after which the series was rescheduled to Thursdays. Overall, the season {{averaged}} about 3.81 million American viewers. The season gained many award nominations, among them two Primetime Emmy Awards for work done on the pilot episode. While some critics {{did not like the}} mostly anthology-like format, others praised the show for the emotional <b>moments</b> <b>and</b> noted the brotherly chemistry between the lead actors.|$|E
5|$|Though Madonna {{is often}} overshadowed by her producers, {{she has her}} <b>moments,</b> <b>and</b> she is never more {{inspired}} than on the so-silly-it's-great 'Impressive Instant', yet another homage to the music that leaves her and legions of followers 'spinning, baby, out of control'. She deserves credit for allowing her latest interpretation of that music to be bent, folded and so lovingly mutilated by her collaborators, and when she chirps, 'I like to singy singy singy/Like a bird on a wingy wingy wingy', I can envision discos from Stockholm to Sacramento going bonkers with her.|$|E

5|$|Union {{announced}} that Soeara Berbisa {{would be released}} {{to coincide with the}} Eid al-Fitr holiday, which began on 22 October 1941, and advertisements for screenings in Medan, in northern Sumatra, date to early November 1941. A review in the Surabaya edition of De Indische Courant, however, indicates that the film had only premiered in the east Javan city on 14 January 1942. That newspaper gave a positive review, describing Soeara Berbisa as a tense film with humorous <b>moments</b> <b>and</b> beautiful scenery. Its review ended with a recommendation that young people and their parents see the film.|$|E
5|$|Jack Verge {{departed}} for England aboard the RMS Mongolia on 25 May 1907, to spend {{three years in}} the UK and Europe undertaking further studies in medicine, while also playing rugby. He was awarded a Fellowship at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and played rugby for Edinburgh University in 1908. Verge's brother, meanwhile, continued to play for University and also played fullback for Metropolitan against the Anglo-Welsh touring team in Sydney on 15 August 1908, which the tourists won 13–16 with a try in the final <b>moments,</b> <b>and</b> against the Ponsonby team on tour from New Zealand in August 1909. On his return from Europe, Verge practised as a doctor in Macquarie Street before joining the army, and did not play competitive rugby again.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Destructoid's Maurice Tan enjoyed the story despite it not adding {{anything to the}} overall experience of Human Revolution and noted that the major choices lacked impact. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found no strong narrative hook, feeling it existed more to plug the main game's narrative gap. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd praised the story for its emotive <b>moments</b> <b>and</b> strong voice acting. Official Xbox Magazines Edwin Evans-Thirlwell found the plot undermined by the villain and some poor dialogue. Tom Francis of PC Gamer, while giving minimal comment on the story as a whole, noted {{that it had a}} strong conclusion.|$|E

5|$|The dipole {{component}} of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14microteslas (0.14G). The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2T·m3 (14μT·R'N3, where R'N is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole <b>moments,</b> <b>and</b> their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune {{may be the result}} of offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{concept was}} listed at No. 46 in Bravo's 100 Greatest Scary Moments, in which Smith {{represented}} the film. The Flight 180 explosion scene {{was included in}} the lists of best fictional plane crashes or disaster scenes by Break Studios, Unreality Magazine, New Movies.net, The Jetpacker, MaximOnline, and Filmsite.org. Filmsite.org also included the plane scene and the deaths of three characters (Tod, Terry, and Ms. Lewton) in its Scariest Movie <b>Moments</b> <b>and</b> Scenes, and all fatalities in its Best Film Deaths Scenes. The demise of Detmer's character entered the listings of the most shocking deaths on film of George Wales and Simon Kinnear of Total Film (No. 29 and No. 10, respectively), Simon Hill of Eat Horror (No. 10), and Dirk Sonningsen of Mania (No. 10).|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, George thinks Liz {{is breaking}} the rules by taking a personal call; he gets angry and wrestles the handset from her. Later, Andy is upset that he listened to Chloe in her final <b>moments,</b> <b>and</b> Liz, {{who has made a}} complaint about George's conduct, tells him that she took a call from an ex-soldier, in tears because his mother committed suicide following the death of her cat. Andy realises that the man's mother is the caller from the previous night. George advises that Andy will not face any repercussions, and asks Andy to help Michael, new to the centre, with his first call. Chloe calls in and speaks to Michael, again claiming that she has taken an overdose. Andy snatches the phone and shouts at Chloe, hanging up on her.|$|E
