The aim of {{this article}} is to analyse the function <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> in relation to musical theory by establishing a parallel between the positions expressed by Schönberg and preceding classical positions, namely Jean-Jaques Rousseau’s definition <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> and Leibniz’s concept of “clear and confused” ideas. Operating in this context, what will be shown is that timbre, according to Leibniz’s description, is a distinguishing, yet undistinguished, quality and that, precisely for this reason, timbre has a limited function in composition...|$|R

In one block of dichotic-listening trials, participants listened for a prespecified target melody, and in a second block they listened for a prespecified target instrument.

This supports the idea of a complementary sex-based pattern of lateralization, with males more strongly lateralized for verbal stimuli and females more strongly lateralized for non-verbal stimuli.

5000|$|Cornelia Fales has {{explored}} {{the ways that}} expectations <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> are learned based on past correlations. She has offered three main characteristics <b>of</b> timbre: <b>timbre</b> constitutes {{a link to the}} external world, it functions as perceptualization's primary instrument and it is a musical element that we experience without informational consciousness. Fales has gone into in-depth exploration of humankind's perceptual relation to timbre, noting that out of all of the musical elements, our perception <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> is the most divergent from the physical acoustic signal of the sound itself. Growing from this concept, she also discusses the [...] "paradox of timbre", the idea that perceived timbre exists only {{in the mind of the}} listener and not in the objective world. In Fales' exploration <b>of</b> <b>timbre,</b> she discusses three broad categories <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> manipulation in musical performance throughout the world. The first of these, timbral anomaly by extraction, involves the breaking of acoustic elements from the perceptual fusion <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> <b>of</b> which they were part, leading to a splintering of the perceived acoustic signal (demonstrated in overtone singing and didjeridoo music). The second, timbral anomaly by redistribution, is a redistribution of gestalt components to new groups, creating a [...] "chimeric" [...] sound composed of precepts made up of components from several sources (as seen in Ghanaian balafon music or the bell tone in barbershop singing). Finally, timbral juxtaposition consists of juxtaposing sounds that fall on opposing ends of a continuum of timbral structure that extends from harmonically-based to formant-structured timbres (as demonstrated again in overtone singing or the use of the [...] "minde" [...] ornament in Indian sitar music). Overall, these three techniques form a scale of progressively more effective control of perceptualization as reliance on the acoustic world increases. In Fales' examinations of these types <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> manipulation within Inanga and Kubandwa songs, she synthesizes her scientific research on the subjective/objective dichotomy <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> with culture-specific phenomena, such as the interactions between music (the known world) and spiritual communication (the unknown world).|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies on}} the {{impression}} <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> have been done and some significant results are clarified about a single tone till the present. However, in actual music, a single tone is not used as it is. In this study, the purpose is that we consider the impression when timbre is performed as music. And furthermore, it examined how {{the difference in the}} impression <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> in music would influence to us as physiology reactions. We created some synthetic sounds that were different types of spectrum structure and applied them to the actual musical piece, the pieces of ‘Lieutenant KIJIE’, which was composed by S. Prokofiev. The Semantic Differential method (SD method) was used as psychologi-cal evaluation, and electroencephalogram (EEG) was taken as physiological evaluation. As a result, there are some significant differences on EEG among the several sounds. Consequently, even if timbre is applied as music, the impression seems to be as same {{as the result of a}} single tone. It turned out that the musical impression greatly de-pended on the difference <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> and the delicate differ-ence in timbre had affected EEG.

40|$|This text {{offers some}} {{principal}} and methodogical issues on studies <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> in words, music and vocal performance. Timbral relationships between word and {{music can be}} conceptualized as a continuum following an fictive axis running from meaning and <b>timbre</b> <b>of</b> words, through <b>melody</b> and music to performance. Sometimes the order might be different, but the ingredients will always be there. To {{get a grip on}} the totality <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> and meaning involved in the songs and performances of one single artist, Swedish balladeer Olle Adolphson, a study was conducted along this research design. The interplay between the inherent timbres in vowel sounds and melody were firstly studied in the songs themselves and relationships were noted that showed signs of systematic appearance. Perspectives from these observations were intergrated with analyzes of timbral bearings on meaning and signification in words and musical settings of a number of songs. Following the axis to performance, aspects <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> were studied with aid of visual representations of the signal as waveforms, melograms and spectograms, verifying observations and as tools for identification and discussion. The study points further towards timbre and emotional cues in vocal performances as signs of individual/envi¬r¬o¬ment interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to draw {{attention}} to the definition <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> as it pertains to the vowels of speech. There are two forms of size information in these “source-filter” sounds, information about the size of the excitation mechanism (the vocal folds), and information about the size of the resonators in the vocal tract that filter the excitation before it is projected into the air. The current definitions <b>of</b> pitch and <b>timbre</b> treat the two forms of size information differently. In this paper, we argue that the perception of speech sounds by humans suggests that the definition <b>of</b> <b>timbre</b> would be more useful if it grouped the size variables together and separated the pair of them from the remaining properties of these sounds. 11 page(s...|$|R
