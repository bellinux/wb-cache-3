The group with lower values for first lower molar occlusal surface area (OSA) corrected for body weight had lower voluntary food intakes (P = 0. 0126). The low OSA group had a greater number of chews per g DM of food ingested (P = 0. 0167), a greater time spent chewing (P = 0. 0476) but a lower number of chews per min than did those with a high OSA (P = 0. 0484). The total number of chews per day was similar for both groups (P = 0. 2011). The number of ruminating chews per day was less for the low OSA group (P = 0. 0377). The group with low OSA values had a larger average particle size in their faeces (P = 0. 0346).

40|$|The {{digestion}} {{of plant}} material in mammalian herbivores basically {{depends on the}} chemical and structural composition of the diet, the mean particle size to which the forage is processed, and the ingesta <b>retention</b> <b>time.</b> These different factors can {{be influenced by the}} animal, and they can presumably compensate for each other. The pygmy hippopotamus, a non-ruminating foregut fermenter, has longer <b>mean</b> <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> than ruminants; however hippos do not achieve higher (fibre) digestibilities on comparable diets, which could be due to ineffective mastication. We performed feeding trials with six pygmy hippos (Hexaprotodon liberiensis) and six banteng cattle (Bos javanicus) on a grass diet. As predicted, both species achieved similar dry matter, organic matter, crude protein and gross energy digestibilities. However, neutral and acid detergent fibre digestibility was lower in pygmy hippos. Apparently, in these species, fibre digestibility was more influenced by particle size, which was larger in pygmy hippos compared to banteng, than by <b>retention</b> <b>time.</b> In spite of their higher relative food intake, the banteng in this study did not have greater relative gut fills than the hippos. Ruminants traditionally appear intake-limited when compared to equids, because feed particles above a certain size cannot leave the rumen.

In total, 54 Saanen goats (18 each of females, castrated males, and intact males) with initial BW 15. 3 +/- 0. 4 kg were used in a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement comprising the 3 sexes and 3 levels of feed restriction (unrestricted/ad libitum, moderate, and severe restriction). Six blocks per sex group, each consisting of 3 goats, were randomly formed and the goats within each block were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 different feed restrictions. The daily amounts of feed offered to animals subjected to moderate and severe feed restriction (approximately 75 % and 50 % of ad libitum rate, respectively) were determined within block based on the DMI by ad libitum fed goats on the previous day. The MRT of particulate matter was determined either using Yb-labeled diet or indigestible NDF (iNDF) determined in situ as markers. <b>Mean</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of the liquid phase was determined by Cr-EDTA. Orthogonal polynomial contrasts {{were used to determine}} linear and quadratic effect of feed restriction, while the effect of sex was compared by Tukey test. The effects of sex and the interaction between sex and feed restriction were not significant on most of variables evaluated. Eating, ruminating, and total chewing time per g DM and NDF intake increased linearly as feed restriction increased (P <= 0. 03). Diet digestibility increased quadratically for DM and OM, and linearly for NDF as feed intake decreased (P <= 0. 03). The MRT of iNDF in the reticulorumen, omasum, abomasum, colon, and total GIT increased linearly with increased feed restriction (P <= 0. 01). <b>Mean</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> in the cecum varied quadratically, being greatest for animals with moderate feed restriction. The MRT of liquid was quadratically (P <= 0. 04) affected by feed restriction in the reticulorumen, cecum, and total GIT, with the greatest MRT observed for animals subjected to moderate feed restriction. In conclusion, the level of feed restriction increased the MRT of particulate and liquid matter.

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) identifies it as a small S-window peak with a <b>mean</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of 4. 59 ± 0. 03 minutes. This study aims at describing the frequency of detection of HbA 2 ' by HPLC in Pakistan and its confirmation at a molecular level. Potential HbA 2 ' cases were identified by a retrospective review of 10186 HPLC chromatograms in year 2006. Prospective samples were collected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, restriction digestion and nucleotide sequencing. Findings One hundred and ninety two potential cases (1. 89 %) of HbA 2 ' were detected on HPLC, having <b>mean</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of 4. 59 ± 0. 05 minutes. Sixty four (0. 6 %) new cases were suspected of having co-existing β-thalassaemia trait when the quantity of S-window peaks was taken into account.

Conclusions It is concluded that diagnosis of HbA 2 ' on HPLC alone is not justified, {{as evidence of the}} presence of this delta chain variant in Pakistani population is yet to be proven. Such small S-window peaks should be either disregarded or confirmed at molecular level, and only then should influence the diagnosis of β-thalassaemia trait.

The method was found to be linear (R 2  >  0.99), precise (RSD <  2.0  %), accurate (recoveries 97.9 – 102.8  %), specific, simple, sensitive, rapid and robust. The validated method can be used in routine quality control analysis of fixed dose combination tablets containing chlorpheniramine maleate, paracetamol and caffeine without any interference by excipients.|$|R
40|$|Objective: A Simple, accurate, {{specific}} and rugged reverse phase liquid chromatographic method {{was developed for}} the simultaneous estimation of Lamivudine, Tenofovir, and Dolutegravir in bulk and tablet dosage form. Methods: A reverse phase gradient program has been developed to separate the all four active ingredients. The ingredients present in different concentrations and chromatographic behavior 0. 05  M Phosphate buffer pH 6. 2  ±  0. 05 adjusted with dilute potassium hydroxide solution, Acetonitrile was used as mobile phase. A gradient programing has been done, on a reverse phase C 18 column (250  ×  4. 6  mm, 5 micron) with a flow rate 1  mL/min, monitored at 260  nm. Results: The <b>mean</b> <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> of Lamivudine, Tenofovir, and Dolutegravir {{were found to be}} 2. 8, 5. 2 and 11. 5  min respectively. Linearity of Lamivudine, Tenofovir, and Dolutegravir was found to be 27 – 162  μg/mL, 27 – 162  μg/mL and 4. 5 – 28  μg/mL respectively. Conclusion: The proposed method was validated in terms of Linearity, Range, Accuracy, Precision, Specificity, Robustness and stability studies and the method is successfully applies to the estimation of Lamivudine, Tenofovir, and Dolutegravir in combined tablet dosage form...|$|R
40|$|Methane (CH 4) {{production}} varies between herbivore species, but {{reasons for}} this variation remain to be elucidated. Here, we report open-circuit chamber respiration measurements of CH 4 production in four specimens each of two non-ruminant mammalian herbivores with a complex forestomach but largely differing in body size, the collared peccary (Pecari tajacu, mean body mass 17 kg) and the pygmy hippopotamus (Hexaprotodon liberiensis, 229 kg) fed lucerne-based diets. In addition, food intake, digestibility and <b>mean</b> <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> were measured in the same experiments. CH 4 production averaged 8 and 72 L/d, 18 and 19 L/kg dry matter intake, and 4. 0 and 4. 2 % of gross energy intake for the two species, respectively. When compared with previously reported data on CH 4 production in other non-ruminant and ruminant foregut-fermenting as well as hindgut-fermenting species, {{it is evident that}} neither the question whether a species is a foregut fermenter or not, or whether it ruminates or not, is of the relevance previously suggested to explain variation in CH 4 production between species. Rather, differences in CH 4 production between species on similar diets appear related to species-specific differences in food intake and digesta retention kinetics...|$|R
40|$|An {{introductory}} look at {{the ecological}} and aquatic systems of the Lake Kariba. A number of ecological characteristics make this tropical man made lake fairly unique compared with the other great lakes on the African continent. The <b>mean</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of the waters is only about 3 - 4 years and {{the bulk of the}} water is lost through hydro-electricity turbines. Being in a tropical area with seasonal rainfalls, the lake experiences annual draw-downs of about 3 m although this is exceeded during periods of drought. Lake Kariba lies over an infertile bedrock and the overall productivity is dependent on nutrient inflow from the catchment (Marshall 1982), so that productivity declines in periods of droughtSwedish Agency For Research Co-Operation With Developing Countries (SAREC...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the use of neutral detergent insoluble nitrogen (NDIN) at a single in situ incubation time point to estimate the undegradable intake protein (UIP) in forages as well as to compare rates of NDIN degradation. Forage samples in Exp. 1 comprised diet samples collected from range and meadow pastures monthly from May through September. In Exp. 2, clipped samples of alfalfa, birdsfoot trefoil, kura clover, and smooth bromegrass, and diet samples of the mixed legume-grass and smooth bromegrass were evaluated. Forage samples were incubated in situ for their <b>mean</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> (MRT) estimated from IVDMD plus a 10 -h passage lag to yield the total MRT (TMRT).

40|$|ABSTRACT Eight rumen-cannulated steers were {{assigned}} to two 4 × 4 balanced Latin squares to evaluate degradability and kinetics of fiber particles from diets based on corn silage and supplements with or without addition of lipids. Dietary treatments were: only corn silage (T 1), corn silage plus concentrate with no added lipids (T 2), corn silage plus concentrate with added soybean oil (T 3), and corn silage plus concentrate containing ground soybean seeds (T 4). Kinetics of gastrointestinal transit of fibrous particles was evaluated based on chromium-mordanted fiber. Events of rumen degradation dynamics of fibrous carbohydrates were quantified using the in situ incubation procedure. The mixed models methodology from SAS was used to fit models and the Tukey {{test was used to}} compare means. The ruminal digestibility of fiber was lower in treatments T 3 and T 4 and, consequently, lower proportions of potentially digestible fraction of standardized fiber and higher proportions of indigestible fraction of standardized fiber for treatments T 3 and T 4 compared with T 1 and T 2 were observed. However, there were no differences in <b>mean</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of the rumen, total <b>mean</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time,</b> mean digestion time, and rumen fill among diets. Animals from T 2, T 3, and T 4 showed higher dry matter intake, organic matter intake, and crude protein intake rates than animals receiving T 1 diet, but there was no effect of the addition of lipid. Treatments did not differ regarding neutral detergent fiber intake. Animals from T 1 had lower crude fat intake than animals from T 2, which showed lower crude fat intake than those from T 3 and T 4. The addition of lipid to concentrate has no effect on passage rate, digestion rate, and intake, when a good quality roughage is used...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A high {{performance}} size exclusion-fluorescence detection (HPSEC-FD) method combined with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) prelabeling was {{established for the}} microanalysis of polysaccharide–protein complexes from longan pulp (LPP). FITC-labeled LPP (LPPF) was fractionated by gel filtration chromatography. The weight-average molecular weight and FITC substitution degree of LPPF were 39. 01 kDa and 0. 20 %, respectively. The HPSEC-FD calibration curves linear over the range of 1 – 200 µg/mL in mouse plasma, spleen and lung samples with correlation coefficients greater than 0. 995. The inter-day and intra-day precisions of the method were not more than 6. 9 %, and the relative recovery ranged from 93. 7 % to 106. 4 %. The concentration–time curve of LPPF in plasma following intravenous (i. v.) administration at 40 mg/kg body weight well fitted to a two-compartment model. LPPF rapidly eliminated from plasma according to the short half-lives (t 1 / 2 α = 2. 23 min, t 1 / 2 β = 39. 11 min) and <b>mean</b> <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> (MRT 0 –t = 1. 15 h, MRT 0 – ∞ = 1. 39 h).
