25|$|The Morning Post was {{designed}} by Henri Julliot to the same principles as the earlier Lebaudy République and Lebaudy Patrie but was larger and faster. The envelope was made of panels of waterproof canvas with two valves at the bottom to allow the hydrogen to be released, either automatically or by hand. An additional <b>manual</b> <b>valve</b> {{on the top of}} the envelope could be used to completely deflate the envelope. Two long quick-release panels were also built into the envelope for emergency deflation. The gas bag had three ballonets, one at the front, one in the centre and one at the rear: the front and rear ballonets could be used to fly the airship up or down. Two centrigual fans were used to inflate the ballonets. Small fixed vertical and horizontal stabilisers were mountes at the rear of the enveleope.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980 was {{launched}} the advertising campaign named “Programma 80”, {{linked to the}} idea of transforming a <b>manual</b> <b>valve</b> into a thermostatic one, thanks to the substitution of the hand-wheel with an automatic head.|$|E
50|$|The {{widely used}} {{reciprocating}} engine typically {{consisted of a}} cast iron cylinder, piston, connecting rod and beam or a crank and flywheel, and miscellaneous linkages. Steam was alternately supplied and exhausted {{by one or more}} valves. Speed control was either automatic, using a governor, or by a <b>manual</b> <b>valve.</b> The cylinder casting contained steam supply and exhaust ports.|$|E

50|$|A basic surface tree {{consists}} {{of two or three}} <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> (usually gate valves because of their flow characteristics, i.e. low restriction to the flow of fluid when fully open).|$|R
50|$|Manually {{operated}} valves {{work with}} simple levers or paddles where the operator applies force {{to operate the}} valve. Spring force is sometimes used to recover the position of <b>valve.</b> Some <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> utilize either a lever or an external pneumatic or hydraulic signal to return the spool.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} {{is very popular}} in the sport of drag racing today, with units equipped with <b>manual</b> <b>valve</b> bodies and transbrakes, {{some of which are}} air shifted. It is also widely used in off-road applications due to its reputation of being nearly indestructible. It does, however, have a reputation of greatly reducing performance as well as fuel mileage, due to the amount of power it requires to operate.|$|E
50|$|Some {{automatic}} transmissions modified or {{designed specifically for}} drag racing may also incorporate a transbrake {{as part of a}} <b>manual</b> <b>valve</b> body. Activated by electrical solenoid control, a transbrake simultaneously engages the first and reverse gears, locking the transmission and preventing the input shaft from turning. This allows the driver of the car to raise the engine RPM against the resistance of the torque converter, then launch the car by simply releasing the transbrake switch.|$|E
50|$|Air pilot control: {{converting}} {{from air}} to oil results in locking of the cylinder. Shifting the four-way valve to either extreme position applies the air pilot through the shuttle valve, holding the two air-operated valves open and applying oil under air {{pressure to the}} corresponding side of the cylinder. Positioning a <b>manual</b> <b>valve</b> to neutral exhausts the air pilot pressure, closing the two-way valves, and trapping oil {{on both sides of}} the cylinder to lock it in position.|$|E
40|$|The beam pipe of the TESLA cryomodule {{is closed}} off by <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> {{on both sides}} of the string of 12 cavities. Compared to the <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> with spring type rf-shield which are {{presently}} used in the linac of the TESLA Test Facility a simplified version will be needed by cost reasons for the TESLA linear collider. Therefore wakefield induced losses for two simplified valve geometries have been studied in detail. Three types of losses are distinguished: transient and resonant losses due to wake fields induced by the valves themselves and losses due to wakes induced in the cavities. The calculations have been done for two different operation modes - linac operation and FEL operation. In addition the transverse kick has been calculated and compared with the strongest kick from a nine cell cavity. The results show, that the losses from a valve with simplified rf-shield are acceptable. 1...|$|R
25|$|Equipment Class 2 has {{redundancy}} so that {{no single}} fault in an active system will cause the system to fail.Loss of position should not occur from a single fault of an active component or system such as generators, thruster, switchboards, remote controlled valves etc., but may occur after failure of a static component such as cables, pipes, <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|Often {{the least}} {{controlled}} factor in an autoclave, the vacuum {{may or may}} not require modulation. In some instances, it is not automated at all and involves little more than a connection to the plant vacuum system, a few <b>manual</b> <b>valves,</b> and a gauge. At the other extreme, the vacuum control system may be considerably more complex than that of the air temperature.|$|R
50|$|Electronic bidets are {{controlled}} with waterproof electrical switches {{rather than with}} a traditional <b>manual</b> <b>valve.</b> There are models that have a heating element which blows warm air to dry the user after washing, that offer heated seats, wireless remote controls, illumination through built in night lights, or built in deodorizers and activated carbon filters to remove odors. Further refinements include adjustable water pressure, temperature compensation, and directional spray control. Where bathroom appearance is of concern, under-the-seat mounting types have become more popular.|$|E
5000|$|The {{contraction}} of the scissor action can be hydraulic, pneumatic or mechanical (via a leadscrew or {{rack and pinion}} system). Depending on the power system employed on the lift, it may require no power to enter [...] "descent" [...] mode, but rather a simple release of hydraulic or pneumatic pressure. This {{is the main reason}} that these methods of powering the lifts are preferred, as it allows a fail-safe option of returning the platform to the ground by release of a <b>manual</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E

50|$|Micro-compounding is {{typically}} performed with a table top, twin screw micro-compounder or -extruder with a working volume of 5 or 15 ml. With such small volumes {{it is almost}} impossible to have sufficient mixing in a continuous extruder. Therefore, state of the art micro-compounders have a batch mode (recirculation) and a conical shape. The L/D of a continuous twin screw extruder is mimicked in a batch micro-compounder by the recirculation mixing time, which is controlled by a <b>manual</b> <b>valve.</b> With this valve the recirculation can be interrupted to unload the formulation in either a strand, or an injection moulder, a film device or a fiber line. Typical recirculation times are 1-3 min, dependent on the ease of dispersive and distributive mixing of the formulation.|$|E
50|$|The {{tank was}} carried via two {{transport}} belts and padded back. It {{was composed of}} two cylinders. Each was divided internally into two parts by a metal diaphragm. The two upper sections were linked together and could hold 6 litres of nitrogen at 20 atmospheres, which acted as a propellant. The lower halves were also connected and contained 12 litres of fuel, a mixture composed of 9 parts diesel oil and 1 part gasoline. Both substances were loaded from special openings on {{the upper end of}} the cylinders, where a <b>manual</b> <b>valve</b> conveyed the liquid nitrogen in the tank to pressurize them at the moment of use. The filler pipe coupling of the lance was located in the lower part of the tank, beside the right cylinder.|$|E

50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigation}} found a gouge in the pipe, probably caused by excavation equipment years earlier; {{in combination with}} brittle pipe material and excessive operating pressures likely led to the rupture. NTSB also found fault {{with the lack of}} automatic or remote-controlled shutoff valves: the <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> were difficult to reach and close, preventing operators from promptly cutting off gas that fueled the fire. Also, NTSB found that Texas Eastern failed to adequately monitor excavation activity on its right of way.|$|R

50|$|BP then {{inserted}} a riser insertion tube into the pipe and a stopper-like washer around the tube plugged {{at the end}} of the riser and diverted the flow into the insertion tube. The collected gas was flared and oil stored on board the drillship Discoverer Enterprise. Before the tube was removed, it collected 924000 gal of oil. On 3 June 2010, BP removed the damaged drilling riser from the top of the blowout preventer and covered the pipe by the cap which connected it to another riser. On 16 June a second containment system connected directly to the blowout preventer began carrying oil and gas to service vessels, where it was consumed in a clean-burning system. The United States government's estimates suggested the cap and other equipment were capturing less than half of the leaking oil. On 10 July the containment cap was removed to replace it with a better-fitting cap ("Top Hat Number 10"). Mud and cement were later pumped in through the top of the well to reduce the pressure inside it which didn't work either. A final device was created to attach a chamber of larger diameter than the flowing pipe with a flange that bolted to the top of the blowout preventer and a <b>manual</b> <b>valve</b> set to close off the flow once attached. On July 15 the device was secured and time was taken closing the valves to ensure the attachment under increasing pressure until the valves were closed completing the temporary measures.|$|E
5000|$|The first monster truck {{ever built}} was {{a pickup truck}} that was {{modified}} with a larger suspension and larger tires. Today, trucks now have custom built tubular chassis, with four-link suspension to provide up to 4-feet of clearance and they also now have fiberglass bodies that go onto the chassis separately and {{are designed to be}} easily removed and easily replaced when damaged. Mounted just behind the driver on most trucks are the engines, which are typically supercharged and run on methanol, an alcohol and corn-based oil, and have displacement up to 575 cubic inches (9.42 L). Axles are mostly taken from either heavy-duty military trucks or road vehicles like school buses, and are modified to have a planetary gear reduction at the hub to help turn the tires. All trucks have hydraulic steering in both the front and the rear (four wheel steering), with the front wheels controlled by the steering wheel and the rear wheels by a toggle switch. The tires are typically [...] "Terra" [...] tires used on fertilizer spreaders, and have measurements of 66″×43″×25″ (1.7×1.1×0.6 m). Most trucks utilize a modified and/or custom designed automatic transmission, such as a Turbo 400, Powerglide, Ford C6 transmission, or a Torque-flite 727. A limited number of trucks utilize a Lenco transmission, which traces its roots to drag racing. Most of the automatic transmissions are heavily modified with transbrakes, <b>manual</b> <b>valve</b> bodies, and heavy duty gear sets. Trucks running a Lenco use a centrifugal clutch as opposed to a torque converter, which are used in automatic transmissions. Lenco transmissions are usually found in two-speed or three speed configurations, and are commonly shifted using compressed CO2.|$|E
40|$|Flushing {{characteristics}} of a tower tank valve flushing system with a 12 -inch-diameter <b>manual</b> <b>valve</b> were determined. Data were obtained using the outside cow alleys in a fourrow freestall barn. The alleys were 12 ft wide and 420 ft long with a 2 % slope. The average flow rate exceeded 8, 000 gallons per minute (gpm) when the average head was above 30 ft and the <b>manual</b> <b>valve</b> opened 80 degrees. Opening the valve to 90 degrees increased the flow rate to over 9, 700 gpm. The velocity of the flushing wave was 8. 5 fpm with a flow depth of 3. 5 in. The estimated wave duration or alley contact time was 14. 6 sec with a 25 - 40 sec release time from the flush tank. The flow rate ranged from 5, 300 gpm to 7, 200 gpm when the average head was between 16 and 28 ft...|$|E

30|$|As a {{blow down}} test is conducted, air flows through a 152.6 [*]mm {{diameter}} pipe, {{which is located}} downstream of the vertical supply tank. A NEWCO N 36726 <b>manual</b> gate <b>valve,</b> a Truline 330 AITFM-CH-SQ pneumatic flow control ball valve, and a Fisher Valves Type 667 -EWT-DVC 6200 pressure regulating valve are located along this pipe.

The pressure regulating valve is controlled by a Fisher FIELDVUE DVC 6200 Digital Valve Controller. The digital valve controller is set to maintain a constant downstream pressure of 413.7 [*]kPa as an individual blow down test is underway. Downstream of the pressure regulating valve, the air flows into the air diverter plenum. Six Kunkle 913 BFEM 03 pressure relief valves provide means to vent over-pressurized air, {{both before and after}} the <b>manual</b> gate <b>valve.</b> Flow static pressure is measured before and after each control valve within the piping system, using both Ashcroft analog pressure gauges and Honeywell FPA 060 -C 860 – 15 digital pressure transducers.|$|R

40|$|Mock circulatory systems (MCS) {{are often}} used for the {{development}} of cardiovascular devices and {{for the study of the}} dynamics of blood flow through the cardiovascular system. However, conventional MCS suffer from the repeatability, flexibility, and precision problems because they are typically built up with passive and linear fluidic elements such as compliance chamber, <b>manual</b> <b>valve,</b> and tube. To solve these limitations, we have developed an impedance simulator, comprised of a feedback-controlled positive displacement pump that is capable of generating analogous dynamic characteristics as the conventional fluidic elements would generate, thereby replacing the conventional passive fluidic elements that often cause problems. The impedance simulator is experimentally proven to reproduce the impedance of the various discrete elements, such as resistance and compliance of the cardiovascular system model, as well as the combined impedances of them...|$|E
