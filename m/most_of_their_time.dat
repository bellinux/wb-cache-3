5|$|Swifts spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in flight. Few {{birds have}} the {{necessary}} speed and agility to catch them, hobbies being the main exception. The nest sites are also usually sufficiently inaccessible to be {{beyond the reach of}} snakes or mammalian predators.|$|E
5|$|The Eisenhowers (especially Dwight in the beginning) spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in a glass-covered porch {{overlooking}} Seminary Ridge. Reading {{and playing}} cards with friends were popular pastimes on the porch, {{it was said}} that he would sit for hours reflecting on his life and legacy.|$|E

50|$|Data-intensive {{computing}} is a {{class of}} parallel computing applications which use a data parallel approach to process large volumes of data typically terabytes or petabytes in size and typically referred to as big data. Computing applications which devote <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> execution <b>time</b> to computational requirements are deemed compute-intensive, whereas computing applications which require large volumes of data and devote <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> processing <b>time</b> to I/O and manipulation of data are deemed data-intensive.|$|R
5|$|Adult solitary wasps spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in {{preparing}} their nests and foraging for food for their young, mostly insects or spiders. Their nesting habits are more diverse {{than those of}} social wasps. Many species dig burrows in the ground. Mud daubers and pollen wasps construct mud cells in sheltered places. Potter wasps similarly build vase-like nests from mud, often with multiple cells, attached to the twigs of trees or against walls.|$|E
5|$|Being highly {{arboreal}} and {{the most}} frugivorous of the lemurs, they thrive only in primary forest with large fruiting trees, where they spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in the upper canopy. By spending {{the majority of their}} time in the crown of tall forest trees, they are relatively safe from predators such as the fossa.|$|E
5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> {{on the forest}} floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers {{are more likely to be}} found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E

40|$|Multimedia {{learning}} {{becomes more}} and more popular all over the world. It has different reasons, for example the development of the technology, people spending <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>times</b> in front <b>of</b> the computer, no need to go to a teacher and nevertheless it is free. The possibilities regarding the materials are numberless. Learning {{with the help of the}} internet provides different advantages and disadvantages for the learners as per age group and level of the learnt language. Bscanglisztik...|$|R

5|$|Few {{months after}} his birth, al-Jamri family {{traveled}} to Najaf, Iraq where his father continued his religious studies. At the time, al-Jamri's family was composed of his parents and his 2-year-old brother Mohammed Jameel. He studied for five years at the Talibiya primary school which was also attended by some Bahrainis such as Sami, the elder son of Isa Qassim. Having no TV at home, al-Jamri and his siblings spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> listening to stories told by their mother or playing with kites outside. At the age of 9, he began practicing Islamic prayers and fasting in Ramadan.|$|E
5|$|In October 1914, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade {{was moved}} by sea to Egypt {{to become part of}} the Force in Egypt {{defending}} the Suez Canal. In the first three years of the war, the soldiers were involved in several small-scale battles connected to the First Suez Offensive, but spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> patrolling in the Sinai Desert and along the west bank of the canal. It was not until November 1917 as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force that the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade was involved in the Third Battle of Gaza. The following year the brigade joined the 5th Cavalry Division when it became the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade and played an active role in the British victory over Turkish forces in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Millipede bodies may be {{flattened}} or cylindrical, and {{are composed}} of numerous metemeric segments, each with an exoskeleton consisting of five chitinous plates: a single plate above (the tergite), one at each side (pleurites), and a plate on the underside (sternite) where the legs attach. In many millipedes, these plates are fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The plates are typically hard, being impregnated with calcium salts. Because they lack a waxy cuticle, millipedes are susceptible to water loss and must spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in moist or humid environments.|$|E

5|$|Not all mating {{takes place}} at the lek, since only a {{minority}} of the males attend an active lek. As alternative strategies, males can also directly pursue females ("following") or wait for them as they approached good feeding sites ("intercepting"). Males switched between the three tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer females were available after nesting had started. Lekking rates were low in cold weather early in the season when off-lek males spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> feeding.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December 1886, munitions {{workers in}} Woolwich, now South East London, formed Arsenal as Dial Square, with David Danskin as their first captain. Named after {{the heart of}} the Royal Arsenal complex, they took the name of the whole complex a month later. Royal Arsenal F.C.'s first home was Plumstead Common, though they spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in South East London playing {{on the other side of}} Plumstead, at the Manor Ground. Royal Arsenal won Arsenal's first trophies in 1890 and 1891, and these were the only {{football}} association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London. In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional.|$|E
5|$|On 21 September 1668, the Royal Charter of 27 March 1668 {{led to the}} {{transfer}} of Bombay from Charles II to the British East India Company for an annual rent of £10 (equivalent retail price index of £1,226 in 2007). The islands were {{handed over to the}} Company on 23 September 1668. Upon {{the transfer}}, Bombay was made subordinate to the Company's settlement in Surat. During 1668–87, the Governors of Bombay, who were also presidents of Surat Council, spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in Surat. During this time, Bombay was administered by a Deputy Governor.|$|E

5|$|Orangutans are {{the most}} {{arboreal}} of the great apes and spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in trees. Their hair is reddish-brown, instead of the brown or black hair typical of chimpanzees and gorillas. Males and females differ in size and appearance. Dominant adult males have distinctive cheek pads and produce long calls that attract females and intimidate rivals. Younger males do not have these characteristics and resemble adult females. Orangutans {{are the most}} solitary of the great apes, with social bonds occurring primarily between mothers and their dependent offspring, who stay {{together for the first}} two years. Fruit is the most important component of an orangutan's diet; however, the apes will also eat vegetation, bark, honey, insects and even bird eggs. They can live over 30years in both the wild and captivity.|$|E
5|$|Producer Yoshinori Kitase and {{director}} Motomu Toriyama have {{explained that the}} objective in mind when designing Final Fantasy X-2 was to embrace the concept of change as the game's theme and establish a more upbeat atmosphere than its predecessor. The reuse of the engine and locations from the original game meant that the team could spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> focusing on the gameplay systems and plot. To portray the drastic change in Spira, the developers excluded summons, redesigned towns, and included vehicles. The low-flying vehicles were added to allow the player quicker access and mobility to the areas that were already available in the previous title.|$|E
5|$|South of {{the church}} stands a cloister {{surrounded}} by ranges of buildings on three sides, the church forming the fourth. As is known, the cloister was {{the heart of the}} abbey, where the monks spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> when not in church, engaged in study, copying books and the creation of illuminated manuscripts. The monks' desks were placed in the north walk of the cloister, and a cupboard for books in current use was carved into the external wall of the south transept.|$|E

After relocating to Salt Lake, Mere learned to write {{in order to maintain}} frequent contact with her children and parents back in Nuhaka.|$|R
50|$|The {{states of}} Jin and Chu were both among the <b>most</b> {{powerful}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time,</b> but while Jin {{was considered a}} legitimate Zhou state in terms of culture and lineage, the state of Chu - whose territory encompassed many non-Chinese cultures in the middle Yangtze River - was considered a half-civilised state at best.|$|R
5|$|The Chili Peppers {{collaborated with}} {{producer}} Rick Rubin for their second record with Frusciante, Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Rubin {{felt that it}} was important to record the album in an unorthodox setting, so he suggested an old Hollywood Hills mansion, and the band agreed. Frusciante, Kiedis and Flea isolated themselves there for the duration of the recording. Frusciante and Flea seldom went outside, and spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> smoking marijuana. Around this time, Frusciante started a side collaboration with Flea and Jane's Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins called The Three Amoebas. They recorded roughly ten to fifteen hours of material, none of which has ever been released.|$|E
5|$|As {{the great}} numbers of troops from both armies gathered, {{it was widely}} assumed in the North {{that this would be}} the battle to end the war. Grant, {{reinstated}} by Halleck at Lincoln's and Stanton's urging, left Fort Henry and traveled by boat up the Tennessee River to rejoin his army with orders to advance with the Army of the Tennessee into Tennessee. Grant's main Union army was located at Pittsburg Landing, while 40,000 Confederate troops converged at Corinth. Brigadier General William Tecumseh Sherman assured Grant that his green troops were ready for an attack. Grant agreed and wired Halleck with their assessment. Grant, whose forces numbered 45,000, wanted to attack the Confederates at Corinth, but Halleck ordered him not to attack until Major General Don Carlos Buell arrived with his division of 25,000. Meanwhile, Grant prepared for an attack on the Confederate army of roughly equal strength. Instead of preparing defensive fortifications between the Tennessee River and Owl Creek, and clearing fields of fire, they spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> drilling the largely inexperienced troops while Sherman dismissed reports of nearby Confederates.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the seven}} books is set {{over the course of}} one school year. Harry struggles with the {{problems}} he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories reach their climax in the summer term, near or just after final exams, when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his followers, the Death Eaters, with the stakes {{a matter of life and}} death – a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books. In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The only exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in which Harry and his friends spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the dénouement.|$|E
30|$|Factor D, {{shown in}} Table  6, {{comprises}} only {{elements of the}} disturbance handler role. There is widespread understanding that small business owner-managers spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> work <b>time</b> in solving problems, which may explain identifying with this role. Owner-Managers are conflict and impasse solvers; {{they are the ones}} that have the authority to get activities going when workers disagree.|$|R
50|$|In school Rosemary and her {{siblings}} were unhappy, as some classmates avoided playing with them. Children from their neighbourhood also avoided them, after being warned not to socialise with {{them by their}} parents. Rosemary and her brothers spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> playing <b>time</b> in an informal settlement within the Kileleshwa Estate where the kids were friendlier and more welcoming.|$|R
50|$|The {{course is}} based at the Townsville Campus {{for the first three}} years. Year 4 is split between Townsville and Cairns. In the final two years <b>of</b> the course, <b>most</b> {{students}} relocate to other teaching sites such as Cairns, Mackay, and Darwin. During these two years students spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> learning <b>time</b> in hospitals and health services.|$|R
