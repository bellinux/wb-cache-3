Aiming to develop a non-clogging <b>microconcentrator,</b> we proposed a new counter-flow concentration unit characterized by the directions of penetrating flows being at an obtuse angle to the main flow, due to employment of streamlined turbine blade-like micropillars. Based on the optimization results of the counter-flow unit profile, a fractal arrangement for the counter-flow concentration unit was developed. A counter-flow <b>microconcentrator</b> chip was then designed and fabricated, with both the processing layer and collecting layer arranged in terms of the honeycomb structure. Visualized experiments using CaSki cell samples on the <b>microconcentrator</b> chip demonstrated that no cell-clogging phenomena occurred during the test and that no cells were found in the final filtrate. The test results show an excellent concentration performance for the <b>microconcentrator</b> chip, while a concentrating ratio of > 4 with the flow rate being below 1. 0 ml/min. As only geometrical structure is employed in the passive device, the counter-flow <b>microconcentrator</b> can be easily integrated into advanced microfluidic systems.

For larger lens sizes, ray tracing calculations can be applied which give ray distributions in agreement with areas of high electric field intensities. Calculations of back focal lengths using ray tracing coincide with results from geometrical optics simulations.

In this study, we present detailed characterization of a corona-based aerosol microconcentration technique developed previously (Diwakar and Kulkarni, 2012). The method involves two coaxial electrodes separated by a few millimeters, one held at a high electrical potential and the other grounded. The particles are collected on the collection (i. e., ground) electrode from a coaxial aerosol flow in a one-step charge-and-collect scheme using corona discharge and electrical precipitation between the two electrodes. Performance of the corona microconcentration method was determined experimentally by measuring collection efficiency, wall losses, and particle deposition density. An intrinsic spectroscopic sensitivity was experimentally determined for the aerosol <b>microconcentrator.</b> Using this sensitivity, we show that corona-based microconcentration is much superior to alternative methods, including filtration, focused impaction using aerodynamic lens, and spot collection using condensational growth.

Aqueous humor and vitreous were obtained from patients with noninflammatory ocular disease {{at the time of}} surgery. Samples were incubated with normal human serum (NHS), and the mixture assayed for inhibition of the classical and alternative complement pathways using standard CH 50 and AH 50 hemolytic assays, respectively. Both aqueous humor and vitreous were fractionated by <b>microconcentrators</b> and size exclusion column chromatography. The inhibitory molecules were identified by immunoblotting as well as by studying the effect of depletion of membrane cofactor protein (MCP), decay-accelerating factor (DAF), and CD 59 on inhibitory activity.

40|$|An {{intracellular}} carbonic anhydrase (CA; EC 4. 2. 1. 1) was purified to homogeneity from a mutant {{strain of}} Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CW 92) lacking a cell wall. Intact cells were washed to remove periplasmic CA and were lysed and fractionated into soluble and membrane fractions by sedimentation. All of the CA activity sedimented with the membrane fraction and was dissociated by treatment with a buffer containing 200 mM KCI. Solubilized proteins were fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, anionic exchange chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The resulting fraction had a specific activity of 1260 Wilbur-Anderson units/mg protein and was inhibited by acetazolamide (50 % inhibition concentration, 12 nM). Final purification {{was accomplished by}} the specific absorption of the enzyme to a Centricon- 10 <b>microconcentrator</b> filter.

40|$|This study {{provides}} important {{information on the}} biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) of three species of tropical bivalves from Peninsular Malaysia and focussed on the accumulation factors of the {{different parts of the}} bivalves. This study found that the different parts of the bivalves could be classified into a few groups, such as macroconcentrator (BSAF> 2), <b>microconcentrator</b> (1 < BSAF< 2) or deconcentrators (BSAF< 1) as proposed by Dallinger (1993). From the results obtained, it was found that Polymesoda erosa is an overall good macroconcentrator (therefore the most potential biomonitor among the three species) for Cd (in all parts, namely muscle, foot, mantle, gill, shell and remainder), followed by Zn (except for shell), Ni, Cu and Pb. For Donax faba, it is a good macroconcentrator for Zn (foot, mantle, gill and remainder), followed by Cu, Cd and Ni. For Gelonia expansa, only 1 - 2 parts were considered as macroconcentrators for the accumulations of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd. Based on the BSAF values, it is suggested that the macroconcentrators found {{in some parts of the}} bivalves, especially in P. erosa, can be particularly useful as potential biomonitors of heavy-metal pollution. Therefore, the present finding should merit further studies using the BSAF values of bivalves as indicators of metal bioavailabilities and contamination in coastal areas of Peninsular Malaysia receiving anthropogenic inputs...|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} of peptide mass fingerprints {{followed by a}} database search is a common tool for the mass spectrometric identification of proteins. To provide a high sensitivity, proteins must be efficiently purified and concentrated prior to enzymatic digestion. Common desalting procedures, like ultrafiltration or dialysis, are very time consuming and work best for high protein concentrations. Another critical point is the proteolysis of the investigated protein, which works efficiently only with concentrated protein solutions. Therefore, efficient concentration and simultaneous purification using solid phase extraction (SPE) will be the method of choice to receive pure and highly concentrated protein solutions prior to enzymatic digestion. In this work, we manufactured magnetic reversed phase particles for the efficient purification and simultaneous concentration of protein samples with volumes up to several millilitres. The SPE procedure was compared with dialysis using commercial available <b>microconcentrators</b> with a cut-off membrane. Due to the magnetic core, each washing and elution step could be performed within 15 minutes. Then, the bound protein was digested directly on the beads, resulting in a remarkable increase of protein detection and better mass structural analysis. Useful MOWSE scores were achieved using bovine serum albumin as a model protein with concentrations as low as 50 ng/ml (720 pM).

Based on the nucleotide sequence of the 16 S rRNA gene of the strain TN 635 (1, 540 pb accession no FN 252881) and the phylogenetic analysis, we propose the assignment of our new isolate bacterium as Lactobacillus plantarum sp.

40|$|The hyaluronan {{receptor}} {{belongs to}} the polymorphic family of CD 44 glycoproteins, which have been implicated {{in a variety of}} cellular functions including adhesion to hyaluronan and collagen, the binding of lymphocytes to high endothelial cells during extravasation, and conferring metastatic potential to carcinoma cells. Here, we demonstrate that the receptor also participates in the uptake and degradation of hyaluronan by both transformed fibroblasts (SV- 3 T 3 cells) and alveolar macrophages. These cells were incubated with isotopically labeled hyaluronan for various periods of time, and the extent of degradation was determined by either molecular-sieve chromatography or centrifugation through Centricon 30 <b>microconcentrators.</b> The macrophages degraded the hyaluronan at a faster rate than the SV- 3 T 3 cells, which may reflect the fact that they contained a greater number of receptors. More importantly, in both cell types, the degradation of hyaluronan was specifically blocked by antibodies directed against the receptor. However, the receptor by itself did not have the ability to degrade hyaluronan, since preparations of SV- 3 T 3 membranes containing the receptor did not break down hyaluronan. Subsequent experiments revealed that macrophages can internalize fluorescein-tagged hyaluronan, and this process was blocked by antibodies against the receptor. Furthermore, the subsequent degradation of hyaluronan was inhibited by agents that block the acidification of lysosomes (chloroquine and NH 4 Cl). Thus, the most likely explanation for these results is that the receptor mediates the uptake of hyaluronan into the cell where it can be degraded by acid hydrolases in lysosomes. The ability of cells expressing the receptor to degrade hyaluronan may be important during tissue morphogenesis and cell migration...|$|R
40|$|For self-sampling or {{collection}} of blood by health personal related to point-ofcare diagnostics in health rooms, it may often be necessary to perform automatic {{collection of}} blood samples. The most important operation {{that needs to be}} done when handling whole blood is to be able to combine automatic sample collection with optimal mixing of anticoagulation liquid and weak xatives. In particular before doing any transport of a sample or point-of-care nucleic acid diagnostics (POCNAD) it is very important to x the gene expression at the time of collection. It is also important to concentrate and separate out the white blood cells of interest from the whole blood before further detection. An automatic sample collection module with a microneedle array in combination with a micromixer is proposed for the blood collection in typical nurse or health rooms. An automatic human blood preparation module is also suggested that could be used for pre-mixing, concentration and lyses. Despite that the concept of microneedle has been intensively studied since several decades ago, the fabrication still remains very challenging. Major challenges concern the high aspect ratio of microneedle structure. In addition, the microneedles have to be su ciently strong to avoid fracture and cracks during practical implementation. The other challenge with small microchannel dimensions on a chip is the lack of turbulences (including fluids that operate with Reynolds number smaller than 2000). Hence a long mixing length is required for good mixing quality. This doctoral thesis focus on the following challenges: (i) design and optimize a continuous concentration and separation unit, (ii) optimize and improve the fabrication process of high aspect ratio metallic microneedle, (iii) develop and investigate the mixing performance of a passive planar micromixer with ellipse-like micropillars, (iv) integrate and demonstrate the pretreatment system. Article I reported the design and optimization of non-clogging counter-flow <b>microconcentrator</b> for enriching epidermoid cervical carcinoma cells. The counter-flow concentration unit with turbine blade-like micropillars were proposed in <b>microconcentrator</b> design. Due to the organization of these micropillar units the functionality cause a unique system of continuous concentration and separation. Due to the unusual geometrical-pro les and extraordinary micro fluidic performance, the cells blocking does not occur even at permeate entrances. The excellent concentration ratio of a fi nal <b>microconcentrator</b> was presented in both numerical and experimental results. Article II proposed a simple and low cost micromixer for laminar blood mixing. The design of micromixer unit was modifi ed from the counter-flow concentration units which mentioned in Article I. The e ciency of the splitting and recombination (SAR) micromixer was examined by theoretical methods, including finite element method and verifi ed by measurement results. Numerical results show that micromixer with ellipse-like micropillars have a well mixing status when its mixing effi ciency is higher than 80 % as Re 6 1. Article III presented that the e ciency of the SAR micromixer for cell lysis. Some bacteria, especially gram-positive, may be diffi cult to lyse with conventional lysis bu er. If the cells are not properly lysed, the quality of the analysis results might suff er. With a splitting and recombination concept, homogeneous mixing can be obtained in short distance. Hence, the quality of the sample after lysis for further process (Nucleic Acid Purifi cation, Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Ampli fication) is also improved. The treatment in the SAR micromixer is comparable lysis by long ultrasound exposure. Hence, SAR micromixer proved to be a good alternative method for cell lysis. Moreover, SAR micromixer has the advantage that it can easily be integrated into an automatic system for lysis and sample treatment. Article IV investigated the mixing performance at the outlet of SAR micromixer. The outlet channel of SAR micromixer was split into four sub-channels. Absorbance testing was used to implement to evaluate the outlet concentration of four subchannels. The homogeneous of fluids are varied with the inlet velocities. Article V presented the optimized fabrication process of the template of extremely long microneedles for blood extraction. Backside lithography with a UVlight source was employed to build the high aspect ratio SU- 8 -based microneedle template. Some major challenges on fabrication process were also shown and discussed in this article. Article VI covers a total process chain from design, fabrication to performance evaluation of the hollow microneedle design. The contribution of this article is a highly applicable theoretical model for the microneedle geometry. The proposed model has been developed to predict the fracture forces.

Extractions with a methanol-water (50 : 50) mixture or 4 -nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline (0. 1 %) in pyridine revealed several radioactive derivatives after TLC and autoradiography, except in the case where the anthraquinone was mixed with sterilized cecal content. Gel permeation on a styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer column of an methanol/water extract of non-sterilized cecal content incubated with [14 C]rhein, showed radioactive deterioration products with a molecular weight higher than rhein anthraquinone. The high molecular weight of some deterioration products was confirmed by an ultrafiltration study where the methanol/water extract was centrifuged on a Centricon- 3 <b>microconcentrator</b> (nominal cutoff: 3000 MW). Aqueous extracts of non-sterilized cecal content incubated with rhein were extracted with chloroform to remove rhein anthraquinone, rhein anthrone and sennidins before being intracecally injected in rats.

Validation of the human immunoturbidimetric assay was performed using a purified canine albumin standarde. Results: Mean CSF total protein was 17. 5 (range 7 - 39) mg/dL. HRE integration profiles were non-interpretable in all unconcentrated specimens. However, clear distinction of the major protein fractions was achieved for all cHRE specimens. CSF albumin levels were measureable in 29 / 30 specimens using immunoturbidimetry. Excellent correlation (Pearson r= 0. 92, p< 0. 001) was found between the two techniques. Conclusion: Immunoturbidimetry and cHRE may be used for routine measurement of CSF albumin. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a dielectrophoresis (DEP) - based microfluidic device with the three-dimensional (3 D) microelectrode configuration for concentrating and separating particles {{in a continuous}} throughflow. The 3 D electrode structure, where microelectrode array are patterned on both {{the top and bottom}} surfaces of the microchannel, is composed of three units: focusing, aligning and trapping. As particles flowing through the microfluidic channel, they are firstly focused and aligned by the funnel-shaped and parallel electrode array, respectively, before being captured at the trapping unit due to negative DEP force. For a mixture of two particle populations of different sizes or dielectric properties, with a careful selection of suspending medium and applied field, the population exhibits stronger negative DEP manipulated by the microelectrode array and, therefore, separated from the other population which is easily carried away toward the outlet due to hydrodynamic force. The functionality of the proposed microdevice was verified by concentrating different-sized polystyrene (PS) microparticles and yeast cells dynamically flowing in the microchannel. Moreover, separation based on size and dielectric properties was achieved by sorting PS microparticles, and isolating 5 lm PS particles from yeast cells, respectively. The performance of the proposed <b>microconcentrator</b> and separator was also studied, including the threshold voltage at which particles begin to be trapped, variation of cell-trapping efficiency with respect to the applied voltage and flow rate, and the efficiency of separation experiments. The proposed microdevice has various advantages, including multi-functionality, improved manipulation efficiency and throughput, easy fabrication and operation, etc., which shows a great potential for biological, chemical and medical applications...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{analysis}} in an on-chip flow cytometry is predictable, which often works with small volumes of reagents. A microfluidic chip {{to mix and}} encapsulate both living cells and drug in picoliter aqueous drops is proposed. By {{the aid of a}} counter-flow unit and a T-junction, this chip can mix cells with drugs, and form them into droplets of liquid in the moving air flow to isolate different trails of samples and keep the cells alive for a fixed time before measuring. Some simulation work was performed for optimizing the chip design. The relation between droplet length and flow rate ratio was found for a frequency in the range of 25 - 100 Hz. The major stability in the droplet formation is reached at Qd/Qc= 1, which correspond to a droplet length of 160 μm. Droplets are separate by 170 μm of air bubbles. The study also proposes an analysis of the pressure variation in water and air inlet during a period of droplet generation. Typically, the pressure over 25 % or 80 % respectively of the max pressure would be reached. The non-clogging counter-flow <b>microconcentrator</b> is used to improve efficiency of mixing. Solutions of water with 0. 3 mol/dm 3 and 0. 15 mol/dm 3 of glucose (respectively 4 % and 2 % glucose in water) were mixed in the tests. For equal flow-rates (25 × 10 - 12 m 3 /s), it reaches a steady-state condition in the outlet with a concentration of 0. 228 mol/dm 3. Since the droplets generator follows the micromixer in the chip, the outlet of micromixer is one of the inlets of the droplets generator. The size of the whole structure is less than 3 mm, which allows them to be easily integrated into a developing flow-cytometry chi...|$|E
