5|$|Kennedy {{earned a}} spot in the 2007 <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bank ladder match by {{defeating}} Sabu in an Extreme Rules match in a February episode of ECW on Sci Fi. At WrestleMania 23, Kennedy won the <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bank ladder match, giving him the right to challenge any World Champion in WWE at any date up until WrestleMania XXIV. Kennedy announced on the April 30 episode of Raw that he would be cashing in his <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bank championship opportunity at WrestleMania 24. On the May 7 episode of Raw, Kennedy, however, lost his <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bank opportunity to Edge, losing mere moments after being struck with a monitor before the match began. Because of the injury Kennedy sustained during his match with Edge, it was revealed that his right triceps muscle tore off the bone and he would be out for a minimum of five to seven months. The injury, however, was not as serious, as the triceps tendon did not tear off the bone but was, in fact, a massive hematoma.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, at the <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bank pay-per-view, The Miz won a <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bank ladder {{match to}} win a {{contract}} for a WWE Championship match that he could utilize at any time {{over the next year}} and became the first performer to win <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bank while being a champion and the second, after Rob Van Dam, to hold a <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bank contract and a title at the same time. Over the next few weeks, The Miz attempted to cash in his <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bank contract on the WWE Champion Sheamus, but was continually interrupted by other wrestlers before the matches could occur, which meant that he retained the contract for future use. Daniel Bryan returned to WWE at SummerSlam, taking The Miz's place on Team WWE, causing The Miz to attack him. This began a rivalry between the two, with The Miz losing the United States Championship to Bryan at the Night of Champions event in September. The following month, Miz defeated John Cena to become the captain of Team Raw, but at the Bragging Rights pay-per-view Team Raw—The Miz (with Alex Riley), R-Truth, John Morrison, Santino Marella, Sheamus, CM Punk, and Ezekiel Jackson—were unsuccessful in defeating Team SmackDown.|$|E
