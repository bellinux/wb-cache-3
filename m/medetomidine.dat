It is important to us a methodical approach to gastro-oesophagoscopy; always start by advancing the scope to the stomach, retroflex the scope completely and check the inner cardiac sphincter for masses. Even a small 1 cm mass in this area can trigger profound vomition. Secondly, when doing oesophagoscopy, consider that you may not (a) have video-recoding facilities and (b) you may need to rescope to assess response to treatment, particularly if this isn’t a good resolution of symptoms, and you may need to check for neoplastic transformation (evidence as ulceration and necrosis of the mass).

40|$|<b>Medetomidine</b> {{proved to}} be an {{effective}} sedative in rainbow trout but not an anaesthetic; its effects were antagonized by atipamezole. The clinical signs of <b>medetomidine</b> sedation were rapid settling {{to the bottom of the}} tank followed by progressive ataxia. The sedative effect was dose-dependent: at 1 mg/litre, 1 of 6 fish rested on its side after 10 min, whereas at 20 mg/litre all 6 rested on their sides. No loss of consciousness occurred. Atipamezole at 6 times the <b>medetomidine</b> concentration antagonized sedation. The average time before fish exposed to <b>medetomidine</b> alone showed avoidance reactions was 10 h, more than 5 times longer than the mean time in fish exposed to <b>medetomidine</b> and then atipamezole. During exposure to <b>medetomidine</b> (5 mg/litre) opercular movement rate decreased from 80 /min to 20 /min. The nature of opercular excursions also changed from being rapid and shallow to slow and deep. Respiratory movements increased after transfer to the bath containing atipamezole. <b>Medetomidine</b> had a marked effect upon skin colour, with fish becoming very pale a few min after exposure. Normal pigmentation was not restored until 4. 5 days after exposure to <b>medetomidine</b> alone, but returned to normal after 10 min exposure to atipamezole solution.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of a medetomidine–midazolam combination on some neurohormonal and metabolic variables in healthy cats. Five cats were used repeatedly in each of 5 groups, which were injected intramuscularly with physiological saline solution (control), 0. 5 mg/kg of midazolam, 40 μg/kg of <b>medetomidine,</b> 80 μg/kg of <b>medetomidine,</b> and 40 μg/kg of <b>medetomidine</b> plus 0. 5 mg/kg of midazolam. Blood samples were taken 10 times over 24 h from a catheter introduced into the jugular vein. Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, glucagon, cortisol, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), norepinephrine, and epinephrine were determined. In addition, the duration of lateral recumbency, rectal temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were examined. The combination of <b>medetomidine</b> and midazolam enhanced the duration of lateral recumbency and reduced the hyperglycemia induced by <b>medetomidine</b> alone. Recovery from hypoinsulinemia induced by the medetomidine–midazolam combination tended to be more rapid than when the same dose of <b>medetomidine</b> was used alone. The decrease in plasma norepinephrine levels induced by <b>medetomidine</b> alone was diminished by the addition of midazolam. Midazolam alone did not significantly change the plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine, or NEFA concentration, but increased the norepinephrine concentration. This study revealed that the combination of <b>medetomidine</b> and midazolam produces minimal neurohormonal and metabolic changes when compared with <b>medetomidine</b> alone in cats...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study we found two agents, the 2 -agonist <b>medetomidine</b> ((±) - 4 -[1 -(2, 3 -dimethylphenyl) ethyl]- 1 H-imidazole) and the 2 -agonist clonidine (2 -(2, 6 -dichloroanilino) - 2 -imidazoline), that specifically and efficiently impede settlement of the barnacle Balanus improvisus, {{one of the most}} serious biofouling organisms in Swedish waters. <b>Medetomidine,</b> but not clonidine, is known to adsorb to solid polystyrene (PS) surfaces in the presence of salt, a feature that is of particular interest in attempts to develop an efficient antifouling surface. We show that <b>medetomidine,</b> but not clonidine, has a significant ability to adsorb to untreated (hydrophobic) PS in two different incubation media: filtered seawater (FSW) and deionized water (mQ). At negatively charged (hydrophilic) PS, <b>medetomidine</b> displays a strong interaction with the surface in both incubation media. At the hydrophilic PS, clonidine also displays a significant interaction with the surface when incubated in mQ and a weaker, but not significant, interaction when incubated in FSW. By studying the effects of time, incubation media, and pH on the adsorption of <b>medetomidine</b> and clonidine, we suggest that <b>medetomidine</b> is associated to hydrophobic PS by means of hydrophobic interactions, while the adsorption of <b>medetomidine</b> and clonidine to hydrophilic PS contains elements of electrostatic interaction. Using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) we detected only weak signals from <b>medetomidine</b> on the hydrophobic PS surfaces, while strong <b>medetomidine</b> signals were observed on hydrophilic PS. This suggests that the adsorbed <b>medetomidine,</b> to a greater extent, desorbed from the hydrophobic rather than from the hydrophilic PS surfaces during exposure to vacuum. The strong surface affinity of <b>medetomidine</b> on both types of surfaces and the preserved antifouling activity are valuable features in designing a marine coating...|$|E
40|$|Correlative {{fluctuations}} in functional MRI (fMRI) signals across the {{brain at rest}} have been taken {{as a measure of}} functional connectivity, but the neural basis of this resting-state MRI (rsMRI) signal is not clear. Previously, we found that the α 2 adrenergic agonist, <b>medetomidine,</b> suppressed the rsMRI correlation dose-dependently but not the stimulus evoked activation. To understand the underlying electrophysiology and neurovascular coupling, which might be altered due to the vasoconstrictive nature of <b>medetomidine,</b> somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and resting electroencephalography (EEG) were measured and correlated with corresponding BOLD signals in rat brains under three dosages of <b>medetomidine.</b> The SEP elicited by electrical stimulation to both forepaws was unchanged regardless of <b>medetomidine</b> dosage, which was consistent with the BOLD activation. Identical relationship between the SEP and BOLD signal under different <b>medetomidine</b> dosages indicates that the neurovascular coupling was not affected. Under resting state, EEG power was the same but a depression of inter-hemispheric EEG coherence in the gamma band was observed at higher <b>medetomidine</b> dosage. Different from <b>medetomidine,</b> both resting EEG power and BOLD power and coherence were significantly suppressed with increased isoflurane level. Such reduction was likely due to suppressed neural activity as shown by diminished SEP and BOLD activation under isoflurane, suggesting different mechanisms of losing synchrony at resting-state. Even though, similarity between electrophysiology and BOLD under stimulation and resting-state implicates a tight neurovascular coupling in both <b>medetomidine</b> and isoflurane. Our results confirm that <b>medetomidine</b> does not suppress neural activity but dissociates connectivity in the somatosensory cortex. The differential effect of <b>medetomidine</b> and its receptor specific action supports the neuronal origin of functional connectivity and implicates the mechanism of its sedative effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>medetomidine,</b> a novel {{antifouling}} candidate, on the burrowing bivalve Abra nitida were studied.

40|$|There {{is sound}} {{evidence}} that <b>medetomidine</b> {{is an effective}} analgesic for acute pain in sheep.

40|$|<b>Medetomidine</b> is a {{relatively}} new sedative analgesic in dogs and cats but some precautions are required when using it. It is a potent α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist and stimulates receptors centrally to produce dose-dependent sedation and analgesia and receptors centrally and peripherally to cause marked bradycardia and decrease the cardiac output. While hypotension occurs frequently, higher doses of the sedative can raise the blood pressure due to an affect on peripheral receptors. Slowing of the respiratory rate is a frequent effect of <b>medetomidine</b> with some dogs showing signs of cyanosis. Other actions that follow <b>medetomidine</b> use are slowing of gastrointestinal motility, hypothermia, changes to endocrine function and, occasionally, vomiting and muscle twitching. The clinical use of <b>medetomidine</b> in dogs and cats is discussed. Recommended dose rates are presented along with precautions that should be taken when it is used alone for sedation, as an anaesthetic premedicant or in combination with ketamine, propofol or opioids. Hypoxaemia occurs frequently in dogs given <b>medetomidine</b> and propofol. The actions of <b>medetomidine</b> can be rapidly reversed with the specific α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, atipamezole, which is an advantage because undesirable and sedative actions of <b>medetomidine</b> can be terminated...|$|E

Blood samples were taken at 10 times during 24 h from a central venous catheter. Plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, cortisol, glucose, insulin, glucagon, and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations were determined.

Urine and blood samples were taken 11 times over 24 h. Both <b>medetomidine</b> and xylazine increased urine production in a dose-dependent manner up to 4 h after injection, but the increase was much less with <b>medetomidine</b> than with xylazine at the tested doses. Urine specific gravity, pH, osmolality, and concentrations of creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) were decreased in a dose-dependent manner with both <b>medetomidine</b> and xylazine.

The effect of a systemic dose of <b>medetomidine</b> (3 /~g/kg), which was previously shown to improve the task performance in old rats, was reversed by an intracortical injection of atipamezole. Lidocaine impaired the DA performance significantly. The results suggest that the beneficial effects of <b>medetomidine</b> on the working memory of old rats are mediated at least partly through the prefrontal cortex...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the cardiovascular {{effects of the}} alpha 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist <b>medetomidine</b> hydrochloride in clinically normal cats. ANIMALS: 7 clinically normal cats. PROCEDURE: Cats were anesthetized with isoflurane, and thermodilution catheters were placed for measurement of central venous, pulmonary, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures and for determination of cardiac output. The dorsal pedal artery was catheterized for measurement of arterial blood pressures and blood gas tensions. Baseline variables were recorded, and <b>medetomidine</b> (20 microg/kg of body weight, IM) was administered. Hemodynamic measurements were repeated 15 and 30 minutes after <b>medetomidine</b> administration. RESULTS: Heart rate, cardiac index, stroke index, rate-pressure product, and right and left ventricular stroke work index significantly decreased from baseline after <b>medetomidine</b> administration, whereas systemic vascular resistance and central venous pressure increased. However, systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial pressures as well as arterial pH, and oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions {{were not significantly different}} from baseline values. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: When administered alone to clinically normal cats, <b>medetomidine</b> (20 microg/kg, IM) induced a significant decrease in cardiac output, stroke volume, and heart rate. Arterial blood pressures did not increase, which may reflect a predominant central alpha 2 -adrenergic effect over peripheral vascular effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} and compare the effects of <b>medetomidine</b> and xylazine on some neurohormonal and metabolic variables in healthy cats. Five cats were used repeatedly in each of 11 groups, which were injected intramuscularly with physiological saline solution (control), 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 μg/kg of <b>medetomidine,</b> and 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg of xylazine. Blood samples were taken over 24 h from the jugular vein for determination of plasma glucose, insulin, cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon, and nonesterified fatty acid concentrations. Both <b>medetomidine</b> and xylazine induced remarkable hyperglycemia that was dose-dependent except for the response to <b>medetomidine</b> from 0 to 3 h. Both agents suppressed epinephrine and norepinephrine release but not in a dose-dependent manner at the tested dosages. Both agents inhibited insulin release and lipolysis, with similar potency, and tended to suppress cortisol release. The glucagon levels did not change significantly in any of the groups. These results suggest that the effects of <b>medetomidine</b> and xylazine on glucose metabolism and catecholamine release may not be due only to the actions mediated by α 2 -adrenoceptors...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to compare the clinical effects and glycemia induced by <b>medetomidine</b> and xylazine in healthy cats and to demonstrate the reversal of the effects by atipamezole. A prospective blinded randomized experimental trial was used with twenty-four healthy adult cats. The animals were allocated into 4 groups of 6 animals each to receive by intramuscular route (IM) : Group M (<b>medetomidine</b> - 50 μg/ kg); Group X (xylazine - 1. 1 mg/kg); Group MA (<b>medetomidine</b> - 50 μg/kg and 60 minutes later atipamezole - 0. 2 mg/kg); Group XA (xylazine - 1. 1 mg/kg and 60 minutes later atipamezole - 0. 2 mg/kg). Rectal temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, electrocardiogram, intraocular pressure, degree of sedation were measured at 0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes, and the serum glucose concentration was measured at 0, 60, 120 and 180 minutes. The xylazine at a dose of 1. 1 mg/kg and <b>medetomidine</b> at a dose of 50 μg/kg (both intramuscular) induced hypothermia, decreased heart rate, respiration and blood pressure and also 1 st-degree A-V block in some cats, but it did not interfere significantly with intraocular pressure. The <b>medetomidine</b> induced a more pronounced hypothermia, sedation and hyperglycemia than xylazine in cats. The atipamezole was an excellent antagonist of the effects induced by <b>medetomidine</b> and xylazine in cats. Also, it did not interfere with the intraocular pressure values...|$|E
