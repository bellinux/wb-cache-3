5|$|The diet of the {{silvertip shark}} {{consists}} primarily of bony fishes, such as grouper, <b>mackerel,</b> <b>tuna,</b> escolars, lanternfish, flyingfish, wrasses, and soles. Eagle rays, smaller sharks, and octopus are occasionally taken. Larger sharks {{tend to be}} more sluggish and take more benthic prey. The differently shaped dentition in their upper and lower jaws allows them to tackle large prey, gripping and sawing off chunks of flesh with violent twists and turns. Silvertip sharks have been observed swimming around the periphery of groups of feeding sharks of other species, occasionally dashing in to steal food. This species often approaches ships, as they are attracted to certain artificial, low-frequency sounds.|$|E

40|$|Present {{status and}} future {{prospects}} of <b>mackerel</b> and <b>tuna</b> fisheries in Bangladesh were assessed during July 2003 -June 2004. The work {{concentrated on the}} fishing gears, length of fishes, total landings and market price of the catch and highlighted the prospects of the fishery in Bangladesh. Four commercially important species of <b>mackerels</b> and <b>tuna</b> viz. Scomberomorus guttatus, Scomberomorus commerson, Rastrelliger kanagurta, and Euthynnus affinis {{were included in the}} study. About 95 % of <b>mackerels</b> and <b>tuna</b> were caught by drift gill nets and the rest were caught by long lines (4 %) and marine set-bag-net (1 %). Average monthly total landing of <b>mackerels</b> and <b>tunas</b> was about 264 t, of which 147 t landed in Cox's Bazar and 117 t in Chittagong sites. Total catches of the four species in Cox's Bazar and Chittagong sites were found to be 956 and 762 t, respectively. The poor landing was observed during January-February and the peak landing was in November and July. Gross market value of the annual landing of <b>mackerels</b> and <b>tunas</b> (1, 718 t) was found to be 1, 392 latch taka. Nevertheless, the <b>mackerel</b> and <b>tuna</b> fisheries in Bangladesh are increasingly contributing to the marine fish production of the country and have very good potential for further expansion for both domestic and export market...|$|R

50|$|The {{syndrome}} {{is named after}} Scombridae family of fish, which includes <b>mackerels,</b> <b>tunas</b> and bonitos, because early descriptions of the illness noted an association with those species; however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have identified other, nonscombroid vectors, such as mahi-mahi and amberjack. Scombroid syndrome can result from inappropriate handling of fish during storage or processing. Cooking the food does not prevent illness, because histamine is not destroyed at normal cooking temperatures.|$|R

40|$|Pelagic fishes are not evenly {{dispersed}} in the oceans, but aggregate at distinct {{locations in}} this vast and open environment. Nomadic {{species such as}} <b>mackerels,</b> <b>tunas,</b> and sharks form assemblages at seamounts (Klimley and Butler, 1988; Fontenau, 1991). Fishermen have recognized this behavior and have placed moorings with surface buoys in deep waters to provide artificial landmarks, around which fish concentrate and are more easily captured. These fish aggregating devices (termed FADs) are common in the tropical oceans (see review, Holland, 1996). In a sense, it may only be the larger size that separates a seamount from a man-made FAD. ...|$|R
