40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between different forms of childhood trauma and eating psychopathology using a <b>multiple</b> <b>mediation</b> <b>model</b> that included emotion dysregulation and dissociation as hypothesised mediators. 142 female undergraduate psychology students studying at two British Universities participated in this cross-sectional study. Participants completed measures of childhood trauma (emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect and physical neglect), eating psychopathology, dissociation and emotion dysregulation. Multiple mediation analysis was conducted to investigate the study's proposed model. Results revealed that the <b>multiple</b> <b>mediation</b> <b>model</b> significantly predicted eating psychopathology. Additionally, both emotion dysregulation and dissociation were found to be significant mediators between childhood trauma and eating psychopathology. A specific indirect effect was observed between childhood emotional abuse and eating psychopathology through emotion dysregulation. Findings support previous research linking childhood trauma to eating psychopathology. They indicate that multiple forms of childhood trauma should be assessed for individuals with eating disorders. The possible maintaining role of emotion regulation processes should also be considered in the treatment of eating disorders...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} found {{a broad range}} of postnatal parental risk factors for the development of internalizing problems in children, but much remained unclear about the influence of prenatal parental characteristics on child internalizing problems. In the current study it is proposed that prenatal maternal (family) stress is associated with postnatal maternal characteristics (i. e. maternal depressive symptoms and maternal parenting stress), thereby posing a risk for the development of internalizing problem scores in young children. First, gender differences on child internalizing problem scores were tested. Furthermore, the moderating role of child gender in the association between prenatal maternal family stress and child internalizing problem scores was examined. Finally, the mediating roles of maternal depressive symptoms and maternal parenting stress in the association between prenatal maternal family stress and child internalizing problem scores were examined in a <b>multiple</b> <b>mediation</b> <b>model.</b> The current study was conducted within the Generation R Study, a population-based cohort from fetal life onwards. Mothers reported on prenatal family stress at 20 weeks of gestation, depressive symptoms at 6 months postpartum, parenting stress at 18 months postpartum, and child internalizing problem scores were measured when the child was 3 years of age. In the present study, 2, 776 families participated. The proposed <b>multiple</b> <b>mediation</b> <b>model</b> was tested using bootstrapping analyses. No significant gender differences were found for child internalizing problem scores. In addition, results showed that child gender did not moderate the association between prenatal family stress and child internalizing problem scores. Furthermore, results supported the proposed <b>multiple</b> <b>mediation</b> <b>model.</b> The association between prenatal maternal family stress and child internalizing problem scores was partly mediated through maternal depressive symptoms and parenting stress. In conclusion, we found that lower levels of family functioning experienced by mothers prenatally placed children at risk of developing internalizing problem scores. In addition, we found that part of this association was explained by maternal postnatal depressive symptoms, and maternal postnatal parenting stress...|$|E

While there is ample evidence pertaining to the role of structural factors in the transmission of HIV-related information, much less is understood about the transmission of accurate and inaccurate information among information sources that Indian adolescents have at their disposal. This dissertation investigated the role of information sources in the transmission of HIV-related knowledge in a nationally representative sample of Indian adolescents who are aware of the disease. A combination of multivariable regression and <b>multiple</b> <b>mediation</b> <b>models</b> examined secondary data from the National Family Health Survey- 3 (2005 - 2006) (N= 35, 603). Results revealed a disproportional reliance on non-reciprocal information sources coupled with an under utilization of reciprocal sources that served as conduits for accurate information. Television was the most common source of information and the most effective in terms of increasing comprehensive knowledge. In contrast, health workers were the least utilized source but the most efficacious at increasing accurate information pertaining to condom availability, mother to child transmission, and the availability of health services. <b>Multiple</b> <b>mediation</b> <b>models</b> also determined that sources of information fully or partially mediated nearly three-quarters of the established relationships between demographic characteristics and HIV-related knowledge.

The present study sought to address this priority by examining whether the extraversion and emotional instability to leisure time exercise relationships were mediated through Elliot's (1999) 2 × 2 achievement goals. MethodsParticipants were 116 female and 97 male volunteers from a Southwestern community (mean age = 37. 21 years, range 24 – 69) who completed measures of extraversion, emotional instability, approach-avoidance achievement goals, and 7 -day recall of leisure-time exercise. <b>Multiple</b> <b>mediation</b> <b>models</b> (Preacher and Hayes, 2008) were run to specifically examine our hypotheses.

Fundamental to gaining an accurate understanding of this issue is to first determine whether {{the most widely used}} process measures assess unique constructs and predict unique variance in pain outcomes. This study examined the associations between the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-SF), and the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ- 8), and determined their unique contributions to the prediction of pain intensity, pain interference, and depression. Methods:A cross-sectional study was conducted with undergraduate students (N= 260) reporting chronic or intermittent pain. Correlations, regression <b>models,</b> and <b>multiple</b> <b>mediation</b> <b>models</b> were performed. Relevant covariates were included. Results:The PCS, FFMQ-SF scales, and CPAQ- 8 were correlated in mostly expected directions, but not so highly as to indicate redundancy. The PCS significantly predicted pain intensity, interference, and depression. The FFMQ-SF Observing and Describing scales predicted pain intensity; Nonreactivity and Nonjudging significantly predicted interference and depression, respectively. The CPAQ- 8 was not a significant predictor in any of the regression models. The PCS was a comparatively stronger mediator than the FFMQ-SF scales in the intensity to interference, and intensity to depression <b>mediation</b> <b>models.</b> Discussion:The findings indicate that pain catastrophizing, mindfulness, and pain acceptance are related, but unique constructs. The PCS and select FFMQ-SF scales were uniquely associated with the criterion measures. However, the PCS emerged as the most robust process, highlighting the importance of targeting this cognitive domain in streamlining pain treatments to optimize outcome...|$|R
40|$|People with {{diabetes}} are at double {{the risk of}} developing depression. Depression is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in people {{with diabetes}}. Levels of A 1 c have been linked to microvascular complications (e. g., retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) as well as depression. The interrelationship between A 1 c, microvascular complications, and depression has not previously been investigated in a comprehensive model, and {{a better understanding of the}} nature of these associations is needed. Preliminary analyses test the assumption that A 1 c mediates the relationship between group assignment in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and microvascular complications. The primary purpose of the study is to examine <b>multiple</b> <b>mediation</b> <b>models,</b> which hypothesize that the severity of microvascular complications mediates the relationship between A 1 c and depressive symptomatology levels. Participants were people with type 1 diabetes (N = 1441) enrolled in the DCCT, a longitudinal randomized controlled trial investigating intensive insulin treatment and diabetes complications, and divided into primary (e. g., no retinopathy) and secondary (e. g., mild retinopathy) cohorts. Biological markers were used to measure A 1 c and microvascular complications. Depressive symptomatology was measured by the depression subscale of the Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised. Simple and <b>multiple</b> <b>mediation</b> analyses were used to test proposed models. A 1 c mediates the relationship between DCCT group assignment and microvascular complications. Microvascular complications partially mediate the relationship between A 1 c and depression for the full sample and secondary cohort. Results support the hypothesis that the severity of microvascular complications, in part, accounts for the association between A 1 c and depressive symptomatology in people with type 1 diabetes...|$|R

Numerous changes occur in attentional processing and affective reactivity across the childbearing period. This review focuses on the definition and methods of measuring attentional processing and affective reactivity. We discuss research studies that have examined the changes in these two processes during the perinatal phases of pregnancy and postpartum, with and without depression and anxiety. We evaluate the importance of using multiple levels of measurement, including physiological and neuroimaging techniques, to study these processes via implicit and explicit tasks. Research that has identified regions of brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging as well as other physiological assessments is integrated into the discussion. The importance of using sophisticated methodological techniques in future studies, such as <b>multiple</b> <b>mediation</b> <b>models,</b> for the purpose of elucidating mechanisms of change during these processes in pregnancy and postpartum is emphasized. We conclude with a discussion of the effect of these processes on maternal psychological functioning and infant outcomes. These processes support a strategy for individualizing treatment for pregnant and postpartum women suffering from depression and anxiety.
