Attempts are occasionally made, e.g. by fashion designers, to promote the acceptance of skirts as everyday wear for men. Cross-dressers have complained that society permits women to wear pants or jeans and other masculine clothing, while condemning any <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> wear clothing sold for women.|$|E
500|$|When {{creating}} the character, Elwes {{did not want}} the character to be looked as [...] "good or bad", even having discussing it with Carter and Frank Spotnitz, another executive producer of the show. The producers and actors have instead labeled him as [...] "ambiguous", and a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> see [...] "evidence through logic" [...] and not superstition. When describing his character to The Hollywood Reporter, Elwes said he [...] "is a guy who is a little more buttoned up, a little more polished; he represents a different kind of FBI." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} was mostly positive. Denise Sullivan of Allmusic praised the song's [...] "gentle vocals and virtuoso guitar" [...] and [...] "haunting middle break which delivers the listener straight {{back to the}} heart of the song once the thunder is finished". Nathan Beckett called it BÖC's [...] "masterpiece" [...] and compared the vocals to the Beach Boys. Writing for PopMatters, James Mann hailed it as a [...] "landmark, genre-defining masterpiece" [...] that was [...] "as grand and emotional as American rock and roll ever got". Pitchfork Media also referred to the song as a [...] "masterpiece". [...] "Extremely poetic" [...] was the verdict of Fountains of Wayne founder Chris Collingwood. [...] "A sad ballad about a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> die with his true love before their love is spoiled by earthly things."' ...|$|E

500|$|Nino, a key villain, {{is portrayed}} by Ron Perlman, {{one of the}} last actors to join the cast. Regarding the casting of Perlman, Refn said, [...] "The {{character}} of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he's done so many great films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be an Italian gangster', and I asked why, and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me." [...] Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is just released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the archetypal character into something more. He said of the role: As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a bad place. By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.|$|E
500|$|Webb {{felt that}} the Lizard was the best villain because, [...] "He's the literal {{embodiment}} of {{the theme of the}} movie, which is we all have a missing piece. He has no arm. Peter has no parents, and he fills that void with Spider-Man." [...] Producer Avi Arad felt likewise, explaining, [...] "ou look at Peter, he misses the parents, [...] Connors has one arm. ...motionally, [...] is a very similar problem. It is a cautionary tale." [...] Webb said that the Lizard [...] "is not the worst villain on the planet. He's not a mustache-twirling guy who wants to terrorize people. He believes he's doing the right thing." [...] Actor Rhys Ifans described his character as a flawed character comparable to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. [...] "Curt Connors is by no means an evil villain," [...] Ifans stated. [...] "He's not like the Batman villains, like the Joker, who are the embodiment of evil. Curtis Connors is a great man who makes a bad decision. ... hat's the whole magic of the Spider-Man idea. These people are the embodiment of our flaws and our desires that lead to tragedy." [...] Ifans described Connors as a force for good throughout his life: [...] "He's a geneticist who wants to help people, like him, who are limbless. In his eagerness to advance that science, he makes a mistake and that's an occurrence we've seen throughout time, sometimes to our benefit, sometimes to our detriment." [...] "...He is a broken <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> fix himself." [...] Ifans added, [...] "I'm not portraying a villain in any sense. Connors does feel cheated by God, and he's looking for answers in science. God seems to intervene." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that despite a [...] "potentially gimmicky tone", the episode provided [...] "a {{lot of fun}} moments along with a little emotional content as well. The show usually balanced sentimentality cleanly, and that occurred here; it avoided becoming too syrupy and featured just enough emotion to make an impact. It also contained some great bits, like Bart and Lisa’s karaoke performance of the 'Theme from Shaft'. It also ended on a hilarious and incisive note." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was the sushi restaurant hostess's [...] "This is our karaoke bar. Now it is empty, but {{soon it will be}} hopping with drunken Japanese businessmen." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Again, a playful dig at racial stereotypes. Homer comes over as a reasonable <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> live his last day in style, and the closing twist is easily as good as the farewells leading up to it." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said that the episode is [...] "rich with sentimentality and Homer's expression of love for his family as he fears that his time is up." [...] He also commented that while all of the chalkboard gags on the show are [...] "funny", this episode [...] "features a true gem" [...] as Bart writes [...] "I will not cut corners" [...] once and then puts ditto marks below. Ed Potton of The Times wrote: [...] "The writers offer black humour by the bucketload, but the grim reality of Homer's fate is never in doubt; his eventual collapse is deeply affecting. A great example of [...] fierce satire being offset by a potent emotional core." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said {{the first half of the}} episode has [...] "fun skewering Japanese restaurants and such, while the second half is reasonably successful at emphasizing character while sustaining the comedy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because {{the poem}} is {{concerned}} primarily with the irregular musings of the narrator, {{it can be difficult}} to interpret. Laurence Perrine wrote, [...] " [...] presents the apparently random thoughts going through a person's head within a certain time interval, in which the transitional links are psychological rather than logical". This stylistic choice makes it difficult to determine exactly what is literal and what is symbolic. On the surface, [...] "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" [...] relays the thoughts of a sexually frustrated middle-aged <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> say something but is afraid to do so, and ultimately does not. The dispute, however, lies in to whom Prufrock is speaking, whether he is actually going anywhere, what he wants to say, and to what the various images refer.|$|E

One day, Tender goes to the mausoleum to steal fake flowers for his employer's garden (a common pastime), and decides to visit Trevor's tomb while he is there. At the tomb, he meets Trevor's sister, Fertility, and they talk. Later that night, Tender has his weekly meeting with his caseworker from the Federal Survivor Retention Program, a government agency that keeps tabs on the survivors of suicide cults. As usual, he asks how many survivors of the Creedish faith there are remaining, and she tells him, [...] "One hundred and fifty-seven survivors. Nationwide." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Ghana (then Gold Coast) {{was under}} colonial rule, a few {{citizens}} {{complained about the}} practice, but the colonial masters turned their heads. [...] They derided him as [...] "the blind <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> help others see". [...] The colonial government did investigate the practice at Atigo shrine near Battor from 1919 to 1924. [...] The investigating District Commissioner, W.

[...] As {{a result of that}} inquiry, shrine slaves held at the Atigo shrine were told they could return home if they wished.

After that, the practice slid back into secrecy and was not brought to the public consciousness again until 1980.|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt {{convened a}} conference of representatives of government, labor, and {{management}} on October 3, 1902. The union considered the mere holding of a meeting to be tantamount to union recognition and took a conciliatory tone. The owners told Roosevelt that strikers had killed over 20 men {{and that he should}} use the power of government [...] "to protect the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> work, and his wife and children when at work." [...] With proper protection, the owner said that they would produce enough coal to end the fuel shortage; they refused to enter into any negotiations with the union. The governor sent in the National Guard, who protected the mines and the minority of men still working. Roosevelt attempted to persuade the union to end the strike with a promise that he would create a commission to study the causes of the strike and propose a solution, which Roosevelt promised to support with all of the authority of his office. Mitchell refused and his membership endorsed his decision by a nearly unanimous vote.|$|E

During a lightning experiment, the orb hurls the boy into the world of Neverwhere, where he transforms into a naked, bald muscle man called Den, an acronym for his earth name, David Ellis Norman. He witnesses a strange ritual, rescuing a nubile young woman who was about to be sacrificed to Uhluhtc. Reaching safety, she introduces herself as Katherine Wells from the British colony of Gibraltar. While she demonstrates her gratitude with sexual favors, they are interrupted by the minions of Ard, an immortal <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> obtain the Loc-Nar for himself. He orders Den to get the Loc-Nar from the Queen, who performed the ritual. Den agrees and infiltrates the palace, but is promptly caught by the Queen, who offers leniency if he has sex with her. He complies distracting the Queen while the raiding party steals the Loc-Nar. Den escapes and races back to rescue Katherine from Ard. Recreating the lightning incident that drew him to Neverwhere, he is able to banish Ard and the Queen. Refusing the opportunity to take the Loc-Nar for himself, Den rides with Katherine into the sunset content to remain in Neverwhere.|$|E
2500|$|Nick Musuraca's {{cinematography}} {{was praised}} in several publications, including The Hollywood Reporter, which called it [...] "very good", and Motion Picture Daily, which also felt his work merited mention. The Film Daily gave By Your Leave a lukewarm review, calling the overall production fair, but applauding {{the work of}} the cast, Morgan in particular, and giving both the direction and photography [...] "good" [...] grades. Motion Picture Daily gave the film a glowing review, saying that this comedy [...] "Straight as a die this one got right over to every funny-bone in the audience ...," [...] and the [...] "picture is as smooth a drawing room farce as has been seen in some time". They applauded the acting of the entire cast, singling out Morgan and Margaret Hamilton, as well as lauding the direction and the dialogue. The Oakland Tribune gave the film a positive review, saying that it would [...] "... rock in gales of laughter the most ennui-ed theater-goer." [...] They especially enjoyed the performance of Morgan, and also gave positive mentions to Margaret Hamilton, Marian Nixon, Glenn Anders, and Neil Hamilton.

2500|$|Scouting for a {{supporting}} cast to play opposite her began. Dan Castellaneta, a relative unknown, {{was asked to}} read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicago's Second City. Castellaneta's portrayal of a blind <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making her laugh. Actress Julie Kavner had co-starred in Brook's spin-off series to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, starring Valerie Harper. Kavner played Harper's younger, socially awkward sister Brenda, a role for which she won an Emmy Award. Kavner {{was at the top}} of the list of people Brooks wanted to be part of the show. Brooks on Kavner: [...] "When somebody's intrinsically funny -- you know, in-their-bones funny -- they never have to work at (being funny), so they're free to work on other things. We were all nuts about her work. She was the person we most wanted to work with Tracey." [...] Actor Sam McMurray read for a guest spot on the show playing William, lover of thirteen-year-old valley girl Francesca's (Ullman) father. McMurray recalling his casting: [...] "The first Francesca sketch, they said, 'Play the guy not so gay.' And I said 'I disagree.' I had a big mouth then -— still do. I said, 'I think he’s more the woman. I think he's more out there.' So I read and I read it big, and they cast me. It was just a one-off, and then we were on hiatus. I did the one week, and I had a friend coincidentally who used to write, a guy named Marc Flanagan, and he was on the show as a staff guy. He called me up and said, 'Did they call your agent?' I said, 'No, why?' He said, 'They wanna make you a regular.'" [...] Another actor who was originally cast for a guest shot which led to becoming a series regular was choreographer Joseph Malone. [...] The show now had its cast.|$|E
