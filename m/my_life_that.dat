5|$|On April 3, 1921, {{while visiting}} friends in Greenwich Village, Hepburn {{discovered}} {{the body of}} her adored older brother, Tom, dead from an apparent suicide. He had tied a sheet around a beam and hanged himself. The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death {{must have been an}} experiment that had gone wrong. The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people. She shied away from other children, dropped out of Oxford School, and began receiving private tutoring. For many years she used Tom's birthday (November 8) as her own. It was not until her 1991 autobiography, Me: Stories of <b>My</b> <b>Life,</b> <b>that</b> Hepburn revealed her true birth date.|$|E

To me, being Jewish means and has always meant being proud {{to be part of a}} people that has maintained its distinct identity for more than 2,000 years, with all the pain and torment that has been inflicted upon it.” Meir strongly identified with Judaism culturally, but when it came to her religious beliefs she was an atheist.|$|E
25|$|When Trotsky was eight, {{his father}} {{sent him to}} Odessa to be educated in a Jewish school. He was {{enrolled}} in a German-language school, which became Russified during his years in Odessa {{as a result of the}} Imperial government's policy of Russification. As Isaac Deutscher notes in his biography of Trotsky, Odessa was then a bustling cosmopolitan port city, very unlike the typical Russian city of the time. This environment contributed to the development of the young man's international outlook. Although Trotsky said in his autobiography <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>that</b> he was never perfectly fluent in any language but Russian and Ukrainian, Raymond Molinier wrote that Trotsky spoke French fluently.|$|E

[...] When Gorriti's work visa expired the following year, however, the Panamanian government refused to renew it, triggering a storm of criticism from international press NGOs and domestic opposition parties. Under pressure, the Pérez Balladares government later relented, and Gorriti's visa was renewed.|$|E

500|$|James Bernardoni {{states that}} the film is [...] "one {{of the very few}} romantic comedy-dramas of the New Hollywood era and one that has rightly taken its place among the {{classics}} of that reverted genre", likening the seriocomic meditation on the couple relationship to George Cukor's Adam's Rib (1949), starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Since its release, other romantic comedies have inspired comparison. When Harry Met Sally... (1989), Chasing Amy (1997), 500 Days of Summer (2009) and Allen's 2003 film, Anything Else, are among them, while film director Rian Johnson said in an interview for the book, The Film That Changed <b>My</b> <b>Life,</b> <b>that</b> Annie Hall inspired him to become a film director. Karen Gillan stated that she watched Annie Hall as part of her research for her lead role in Not Another Happy Ending.|$|E
500|$|Gens' {{wife and}} {{daughter}} at first went to Kaunas but, after {{the formation of the}} ghetto, they returned to Vilnius and lived near the ghetto's perimeter. His wife used her maiden name rather than Gens'. According to Leonard Tushnet, there were unfounded rumors that the couple had divorced. Gens did not refute the rumors, as he thought they would help protect his family. Other sources state that the two were divorced to protect Elvyra and Ada. Elvyra Gens was opposed to her husband taking {{a leading role in the}} government of the ghetto and urged him to [...] "pass" [...] as a Lithuanian. It is not clear exactly why Gens went into the ghetto, but in a letter to his wife, Gens said [...] "This is the first time in <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> I have to engage in such duties. My heart is broken. But I shall always do what is necessary for the sake of the Jews in the ghetto." ...|$|E

500|$|While filming Dark Season, Winslet, aged 15, began {{a romantic}} {{relationship}} with the actor-writer Stephen Tredre, who was 12 years her senior.

Winslet missed the premiere of Titanic to attend his funeral, and described the experience of losing him as [...] "unbelievably heartbreaking". In a 2008 interview, she said that she never got over his death. A year after Treadre's death, Winslet met Jim Threapleton on the set of Hideous Kinky, in which he was an assistant director. They married in November 1998 at her primary school in Reading, and she gave birth to their daughter, Mia, in 2000.

500|$|The Shins {{were not}} truly a band when James Mercer {{composed}} the song, {{and the idea}} of making music his career seemed uncertain. The song's creation was partially a reaction to the music scene in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the band's hometown, which Mercer described as [...] "macho, really heavy, and aggressive." [...] He characterized it as a punk rock-esque move akin to giving the finger to the entire town. The song was born out of frustration regarding his personal life and future. [...] "It's definitely a moment in <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> <b>that</b> sort of angst and confusion about what my future was going to be," [...] he remarked. He described it as a [...] "Saturn return" [...] period of his life, in which he felt he could not relate to anyone in his hometown and his life there had become depressing. He had become a [...] "hermit" [...] working on the band's debut album, Oh, Inverted World, and had lost interest in partying with friends.
