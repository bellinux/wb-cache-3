50|$|<b>Missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>point</b> (MAP or MAPt) is {{the point}} {{prescribed}} in each instrument approach at which a missed approach procedure shall be executed if the required visual reference does not exist. It defines the point for both precision and non-precision approaches wherein the missed approach segment of an approach procedure begins. A pilot must execute a missed approach if a required visual reference (normally the runway or its environment) is not in sight upon reaching the MAP or the pilot decides it is unsafe {{to continue with the}} approach and landing to the runway. The <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>point</b> is published in the approach plates and contains instructions for missed approach procedures to be executed at this point.|$|E
50|$|The crash site, on a 2,300 ft hill, was 1.6 mi {{northeast}} {{of where the}} aircraft should {{have been on the}} inbound course to the NDB. The published NDB approach brings the inbound aircraft down a valley, and has a minimum descent height of 2,150 ft at the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>point</b> (where they should have climbed and turned to the right if the runway was not in view), which is below the elevation of the hills to the north. The runway is at 510 ft MSL. Five other aircraft had landed prior to the CT-43A and had not experienced any problems with the navigational aids. There was no emergency call from the pilots, and they did not initiate a missed approach, even though they were beyond the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>point</b> when they hit the hill at 2:57 PM local time.|$|E
50|$|At 18:56:06 MST, {{the flight}} was cleared for the VOR/DME-C {{instrument}} approach to the airport, whereupon it proceeded to the Red Table VOR, executed a sequence of designated step-down maneuvers and began final approach to the runway. As it continued its descent past the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>point</b> - where the runway must be in sight to continue - the pilots had still not visually located the runway in the increasing darkness and snow showers. At 19:01:57 MST, while in a steep left bank, the aircraft crashed into the terrain, killing all 18 persons on board.|$|E
50|$|The <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> {{procedure}} normally {{includes an}} initial heading or track to follow, and altitude to climb to, typically followed by holding instructions {{at a nearby}} navigation fix. The pilot is expected to inform ATC by radio of the initiation of the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> as soon as possible. ATC may simply acknowledge the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> call or modify the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> instructions, for example, with vectors to another fix. ATC may subsequently clear the flight for another approach at the same airport or clear it to an alternative airport, depending on the pilot's intentions as well as fuel, weather and traffic considerations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Missed</b> <b>approach</b> is a {{procedure}} {{followed by a}} pilot when an instrument approach cannot be completed to a full-stop landing. The instructions for the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> may be assigned by air traffic control (ATC) prior to the clearance for the approach. If ATC has not issued specific instructions prior to the <b>approach</b> and a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> is executed, the pilot must follow the (default) <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedure specified for the approach. Prior to commencing the approach, if the pilot believes that a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> may occur, {{he or she can}} make a specific request to ATC in the event that one occurs. Such a request may include heading and altitude instructions to avoid in-flight delays (such as holds) and efficiently maneuver the aircraft into position for either its next approach or a diversion to an alternate airport.|$|R
5000|$|On 5 January 1989, a Federal Express Cessna 208B Super Cargomaster (registration N945FE) {{executed}} a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> {{but failed to}} do so in accordance with published <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedures, resulting in a collision with trees. The pilot, the only occupant, was uninjured.|$|R
50|$|The GPS {{implementation}} of the non-precision LNAV approach can only be flown if satellite configuration {{at the time of}} the approach will accurately support a full scale course deviation indication of 0.3 nautical miles (about 1800 feet to the left and right or 3600 feet total) starting at the final approach fix and extending all the way to the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>point.</b> If this sensitivity does not occur, the pilot will be notified by the on-board receiver (via RAIM checking) and must not make the descent onto the final leg.|$|E
50|$|A {{middle marker}} {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as an outer marker. It is normally positioned 0.5 to 0.8 nmi km before the runway threshold. When the aircraft is above the middle marker, the receiver's amber middle marker light starts blinking, and a repeating pattern of audible morse code-like dot-dashes at a frequency of 1,300 Hz in the headset. This alerts the pilot that the CAT I <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>point</b> (typically 200 ft above the ground level on the glideslope) has been passed and should have already initiated the missed approach if one of several visual cues has not been spotted.|$|E
5000|$|Generally, if a pilot determines by {{the time}} the {{aircraft}} is at the decision height (for a precision approach) or <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>point</b> (for a non-precision approach), that the runway or its environment is not in sight, or that a safe landing cannot be accomplished for any reason, the landing approach must be discontinued (a [...] "go-around") and the missed approach procedure must be immediately initiated. It is also common for pilots to practice a missed approach as part of initial or recurrent instrument training. In such cases, a pilot may execute multiple instrument approaches in a row, with missed approaches between them.|$|E
5000|$|Manx2 Flight 7100 - Also {{crashed in}} fog after <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the crash, {{according}} to the NTSB, was improper IFR (Instrument flight rules) operation, failure to adhere to instrument approach procedures. The airplane collided with a mountain on a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> to landing, after multiple <b>missed</b> <b>approaches.</b> The weather at the airport was below approach minima with a low ceiling and sea fog.|$|R
50|$|When {{conducting}} an RNP AR <b>approach</b> with a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> less than RNP 1.0, no single-point-of-failure {{can cause the}} loss of guidance compliant with the RNP value associated with a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedure. Typically, the aircraft must have at least dual GNSS sensors, dual flight management systems, dual air data systems, dual autopilots, and a single inertial reference unit.|$|R
50|$|The {{approach}} minimums for LNAV {{approaches are}} {{higher than that of}} ILS approaches, and RNAV approaches that incorporate vertical guidance. Aircraft executing an LNAV instrument approach must descend incrementally rather than follow a fixed glide slope. This is called a 'non-precision' approach to distinguish it from a precision approach in which there is electronic vertical (slope) guidance down to a decision altitude (DA). In the case of the non-precision approach, the aircraft can descend only to what is referred to as a minimum descent altitude (MDA). An MDA segment is flown until the airport is in sight and the pilot can land. If the airport is not in sight by the time the pilot reaches a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>point</b> (MAP) on the MDA, the aircraft must execute a missed approach.|$|E
50|$|A concept {{related to}} the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>point</b> is the visual descent point, or VDP. Determination of its {{location}} {{is done by the}} designers of the instrument approach procedure, but typically this is a point on the final approach course of a non-precision approach, from which the aircraft would be able to continue its descent from the MDA to the runway threshold while maintaining a standard 3° descent angle while being assured obstacle clearance. In other words, usually it is the point (on the profile view of the approach) where a line depicting a 3° descent angle would intercept the horizontal line at the MDA. If the pilot does not have the required visual reference to continue the descent from the MDA at this point, he/she must continue to fly at or above the MDA, and the rapidly steepening descent angle required to complete a successful landing on the runway means that a safe and successful approach becomes less likely.|$|E
50|$|The minimum descent {{altitude}} (MDA) is {{the lowest}} altitude, expressed in feet above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure where no electronic glideslope is provided. Unlike with DH or DA, a missed approach need not be initiated immediately upon reaching the altitude. A pilot flying a non-precision approach may descend to the MDA and maintain it until reaching the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>point</b> (MAP), then initiate a missed approach if the required visual reference was not obtained. An aircraft must not descend below the MDA until visual reference is obtained, and which the aircraft can land while performing normal maneuvers, which differs slightly from a DH/DA in that while the missed approach procedure must be initiated at or prior to the DH/DA, because of its vertical momentum, during a precision approach an aircraft may end up descending slightly below the DH/DA {{during the course of}} the missed approach.|$|E
5000|$|According to the {{official}} investigation report, released on 28 November 2014, the probable cause of the accident was the flight crew's failure to properly execute the published <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedure, {{which resulted in the}} aircraft impacting terrain. A sudden change of weather conditions and an improperly executed published instrument approach necessitated the go-around. [...] The recordings show that the flight crew initiated a right turn according to the lateral <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> trajectory without succeeding in reaching the vertical trajectory. Specifically, the flight crew didn't follow the vertical profile of <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> as the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> altitude was set at 600 ft and the aircraft system went into altitude capture mode. When the flight crew realized that the altitude was too close to the ground, the PF over-reacted, which led to a high pitch attitude of 33°. It then impacted trees. The fuselage struck the bank and plunged into the river.|$|R

50|$|An {{investigation}} into the crash found that the visual flight in weather conditions below minimums. Flight 150 was in a downwind leg as the aircraft was on approach to the airport in fog. It is unknown why the air traffic controller {{did not tell the}} pilots of flight 150 to execute a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> or why the pilots themselves didn't execute a <b>missed</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{reason for}} abandoning the {{approach}} is unknown. Since the meteorological conditions were close to the minimum permitted for an IFR approach, the aircraft would need to approach close to the ECHO 1 approach trajectory. On the aircraft's improper approach, the investigation noted {{that there was a}} low probability that the aircraft could have stabilized its approach in order to land safely. With a wet runway and if the aircraft crossed the threshold at the reference speed, the aircraft would have a 385 m safety margin to land on the wet runway. There was a 2 kn tailwind {{at the time of the}} attempted landing. Additionally, a non-directional radio beacon (NDB) just before the runway (RR NBD) was non-functional on the day of the accident. Because the aircraft did not follow the ECHO 1 approach, it did not pass the only NBD available for determining the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>point,</b> which was SAT NBD. The report concluded that [...] "the fact that the crew did not follow the profile of the ECHO 1 approach, along with their difficulty stabilizing the aircraft on a final approach, and the tail wind component condition may have contributed to their decision to discontinue the approach." ...|$|E
50|$|The Boeing CT-43A {{used for}} this flight was {{formerly}} a T-43A navigator training aircraft that was converted for distinguished visitor travel. The flight was on an instrument flight rules non-directional beacon (NDB) approach, which is a non-precision type of instrument approach, to Runway 12 when it strayed off course. Non-precision approaches are {{those that do not}} incorporate vertical guidance. While NDB approaches are essentially obsolete in the United States, they are still used widely {{in other parts of the}} world. Because of their infrequent use in the United States, many American pilots are not fully proficient in performing them (a NASA survey showed that 60% of American transport-rated pilots had not flown an NDB approach in the last year). The investigation board determined that the approach used was not approved for Department of Defense aircraft, and should not have been used by the aircraft crew. The board determined that the particular NDB approach used required two operating ADFs, the instrument used to fly such an approach, on board the aircraft, but this aircraft only had one ADF installed. To successfully fly the approach, one ADF was required to track the outbound course of 119° from the Kolocep NDB (KLP), while another ADF was required to observe when the aircraft had flown beyond the Cavtat NDB (CV), which marked the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>point.</b> Further, the board noted that the approach was rushed, with the aircraft flying at 80 kn above the proper final approach speed, and had not received the proper landing clearance from the control tower.|$|E
40|$|The task {{involved}} {{the control of}} two simulated aircraft targets per trial, in a 37. 0 -km radius terminal area, by means of conventional radar vectoring and/or speed control. The goal was {{to insure that the}} two targets crossed the <b>Missed</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Point</b> (MAP) at the runway threshold exactly 60 sec apart. The effects on controller performance of the MLS configuration under wind and no-wind conditions were examined. The data for mean separation time between targets at the MAP and the range about that mean were analyzed by appropriate analyses of variance. Significant effects were found for mean separation times {{as a result of the}} configuration of the MLS and for interaction between the configuration and wind conditions. The analysis of variance for range indicated significantly poorer performance under the wind condition. These findings are believed to be a result of certain perceptual factors involved in radar air traffic control (ATC) using the MLS with separation of targets in time...|$|E

50|$|ICAO defines {{decision}} altitude/decision height as {{a specified}} altitude or height (A/H) in the precision approach {{at which a}} <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> must be initiated if the required visual reference to continue the approach has not been established. A decision height (DH) or decision altitude (DA) is a specified lowest height or altitude in the approach descent at which, if the required visual reference to continue the approach (such as the runway markings or runway environment) is not visible to the pilot, the pilot must initiate a <b>missed</b> <b>approach.</b> The specific values for DH and/or DA at a given airport are established with intention to allow a pilot sufficient time to safely re-configure an aircraft to climb and execute the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedures while avoiding terrain and obstacles. A DH/DA denotes the altitude in which a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedure must be started, it does not preclude the aircraft from dipping below the prescribed DH/DA. A decision height is measured AGL (above ground level) while a decision altitude is measured above MSL (mean sea level). They are used for precision approaches.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of {{air traffic controllers}} using a simulated microwave landing system to control the landing of STOL aircraft is investigated. In a series of two experiments, controllers were asked to achieve a 60 -sec separation between targets at the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>point</b> when only two targets were on the simulated radar scope, and {{in the presence of}} 25 targets, with up to 10 on the screen at any one time. In both experiments, the presence of a ground wind is found to degrade separation performance, and an increased work load results in even greater separation variability, as the controllers did not have time to convert aircraft distances into times. In addition, curved courses are found to have an effect on performance. It is thus recommended that {{in order to create a}} practical air traffic control system with separation standards based on time, as in the MLS, controller work loads should be reduced and aircraft positions should be displayed with respect to time rather than distance...|$|E
40|$|The {{document}} {{describes the}} results of the EC 135 R/C flight trials that have been carried out with DLR’s research helicopter FHS, an EC 135, in Bremen. A curved approach procedure has been developed in WP 2. 4 for Bremen airport taking into account the idea of simultaneous non-interfering rotorcraft IFR operations. This concept offers the possibility of allowing individual rotorcraft approaches that do not interfere with standard fixed wing traffic and thus will contribute to increase capacity in terms of airport throughput. Since future ATM operations will be based on 4 D trajectories, rotorcraft IFR operations might as well require 4 D capabilities. A basic requirement for this kind of operation is the rotorcraft’s capability to meet a required time of arrival (RTA) at a given waypoint. The functions developed within OPTIMAL for EC 135 experimental Flight Management System allow flying a time referenced curved approach with an RTA given at the <b>Missed</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Point</b> which has been defined {{at the end of the}} curve. These functions and the design of the procedure itself have been tested in flight trials at Bremen airport. The main objectives were to verify the flyability of the curved approach and to assess the 4 D capability of the experimental FMS functions. SBAS (EGNOS) has been used as primary input to the navigation system. 35 approaches to Bremen under various weather (wind) conditions have been carried out. The curved approaches have been flown with two different guidance concepts: a tunnel display and a bug-PFD-guidance display. All approaches have been flown manually without any SAS assistance or autopilot assistance. With respect to the Flight Technical Error (FTE), the results obtained with the tunnel display are better than those obtained with the bugs guidance concept.
