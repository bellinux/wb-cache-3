5|$|After the American Revolutionary War, {{the brand-new}} United States {{struggled}} to stay financially afloat. National income was desperately needed and most came from tariffs on imported goods. Because of rampant smuggling, the need was immediate for strong enforcement of tariff laws. On 4 August 1790 the United States Congress, urged on by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, created the Revenue-Marine, the forerunner for the United States Coast Guard, {{to enforce the}} tariff and all other maritime laws. Ten cutters were initially ordered. Between 1790 and 1797 when the Navy Department was created, the Revenue-Marine was the only armed <b>maritime</b> <b>service</b> for the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{capture of}} the Harriet Lane {{involved}} also possibly the oldest active combatant of the Civil War. Captain Levi C. Harby of the Texas <b>Maritime</b> <b>Service,</b> 69 years old, was {{in command of the}} Neptune, and was the last to leave that vessel after ramming the Harriet Lane portside. The Neptune was hit by Federal gunners and sank, but the water was shallow enough that Harby and his men could continue firing their guns from her deck. This distraction enabled the Bayou City to carry out the successful starboard attack that captured the Harriet Lane.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the United States <b>Maritime</b> <b>Service</b> {{created a}} Hospital Corps {{similar to the}} U.S. Navy's and sent pursers through this {{hospital}} corpsman training, to serve in a combined administrative and medical role on civilian tankers, freighters, and oilers. Prior to this, there were no competent trained personnel to perform first aid aboard these vessels. The purser-corpsman was trained in anatomy, physiology, pharmacy, clinical laboratory, hygiene and sanitation, emergency treatment, first aid, and nursing. They were taught how to administer injections, treat compound fractures, administer blood plasma, and suture wounds.|$|E

25|$|He {{was born}} in Kimberley, South Africa in 1939. Woodburne's father was a former South African Air Force wartime pilot who farmed near Maclear in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Woodburne was schooled in the Eastern Cape and Swaziland and served in the Naval Gymnasium at Saldanha Bay in 1958. He then joined the Permanent Force and {{enrolled}} for a Bachelor of Military Science (B. Mil) degree studying at both Stellenbosch University and the Faculty of Military Science at the South African Military Academy from 1960 to 1961. He did not graduate and after his time at the Academy he started <b>maritime</b> <b>service</b> on frigates.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Maude Monell donated Vema to the American war effort. The {{vessel was}} put into service as a {{merchant}} marine cadet training ship. The Vema was first put to use patrolling coastal waters for the US Coast Guard. Having lost her glitter, the vessel patrolled coastal waters and later served as a barrack and a training ship for the United States Merchant Marine. Assigned to the US <b>Maritime</b> <b>Service</b> Training Station on Hoffman Island, her sailing area was listed as 14,000 sqf. After the war she was abandoned off Staten Island until Louis Kenedy, a captain from Nova Scotia, salvaged the vessel. LDEO leased the vessel in 1953 and soon bought her for $100,000.|$|E
25|$|While the {{majority}} of American merchant mariners are employed by shipping businesses and accordingly wear either uniforms prescribed by their employers or civilian attire, some officers receive commissions in the United States <b>Maritime</b> <b>Service</b> for federal government duty, such as {{the faculty of the}} United States Merchant Marine Academy and the Military Sealift Command's civilian officers manning non-commissioned United States Naval Ships. These officers wear uniforms and rank insignia adopted from the U.S. Navy, albeit with United States Merchant Marine's own button design, cap device, awards, and decorations. The combination covers these officers are identical to those of naval officer with respect to colors, chinstrap and peak ornamentation. The buttons securing the chin strap to the sides of the band are smaller versions of the buttons worn on their coats. The USMS cap device is a rendering of the Merchant Marine device in gold- and silver-colored metal. Like the device worn by naval officers, it features a silver eagle, with wings outstretched, above a gold shield; the shield, however, is defaced with an anchor and surrounded by a wreath.|$|E

500|$|The {{bones of}} a total of 179 people were found during the {{excavations}} of the Mary Rose, including 92 [...] "fairly complete skeletons", more or less complete collections of bones associated with specific individuals. Analysis of these has shown that crew members were all male, most of them young adults. Some were no more than 11–13 years old, and the majority (81%) under 30. They were mainly of English origin and, according to archaeologist Julie Gardiner, they most likely came from the West Country; many following their aristocratic masters into <b>maritime</b> <b>service.</b> There were also a few people from continental Europe. An eyewitness testimony right after the sinking refers to a survivor who was a Fleming, and the pilot may very well have been French. Analysis of oxygen isotopes in teeth indicates that some were also of southern European origin. In general they were strong, well-fed men, but many of the bones also reveal tell-tale signs of childhood diseases and a life of grinding toil. The bones also showed traces of numerous healed fractures, probably the result of on-board accidents.|$|E
