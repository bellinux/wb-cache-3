25|$|In 2013, a {{group from}} the University of Tokyo {{developed}} cell laden fibers up to a meter in length and {{on the order of}} 100µm in size. These fibers were created using a <b>microfluidic</b> <b>device</b> that forms a double coaxial laminar flow. Each 'layer' of the <b>microfluidic</b> <b>device</b> (cells seeded in ECM, a hydrogel sheath, and finally a calcium chloride solution). The seeded cells culture within the hydrogel sheath for several days, and then the sheath is removed with viable cell fibers. Various cell types were inserted into the ECM core, including myocytes, endothelial cells, nerve cell fibers, and epithelial cell fibers. This group then showed that these fibers can be woven together to fabricate tissues or organs in a mechanism similar to textile weaving. Fibrous morphologies are advantageous in that they provide an alternative to traditional scaffold design, and many organs (such as muscle) are composed of fibrous cells.|$|E
25|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{group of}} researchers led by Prof. Amy Shen, developed a novel cryopreservation method {{that helps to}} protect pancreatic islets from ice damage, and facilitates real-time assessments of cell viability. The novel technique employs a droplet <b>microfluidic</b> <b>device</b> to encapsulate pancreatic islets in hydrogel made of alginate, a natural polymer extracted from seaweed. These capsules have a unique microstructure: a porous network and considerable amount of non-freezable water. Non-freezable bound water does not form ice due to the strong association between water molecules and the hydrogel networks. Hydrogel capsules with large amounts of non-freezable bound water protect the cells from the ice damage and {{reduce the need for}} cryoprotectants—special substances that minimise or prevent freezing damage and can be toxic in high concentrations. The hydrogel capsule allows small molecules, e.g. nutrients and islet secretions, to pass through the membrane easily, but prevents direct contact between implanted cells and host cells and so prevent an attack on transplants by the autoimmune response. The use of a real-time single-islet oxygen sensor – a fluorescent oxygen-sensitive dye in hydrogel capsules allows to use a simple and cheap yet reliable individual-islet-based quality control of viability for the entire islet processing procedure prior to transplantation. Fluorescence indicates whether cells are consuming oxygen and, therefore, are alive and healthy.|$|E

However, reversible <b>microfluidic</b> <b>devices</b> fabricated with current standard procedures can only be used for low-pressure applications. Assembling technology based on glass-PDMS-glass sandwich configuration provides an alternative sealing method for reversible <b>microfluidic</b> <b>devices,</b> which can drastically increase the sealing strength of reversibly adhered devices. The improvement mechanism of sealing properties of <b>microfluidic</b> <b>devices</b> based on the sandwich technique has not been fully characterized, hindering further improvement and broad use of this technique. Here, we characterize, for the first time, the effect of various parameters on the sealing strength of reversible PDMS/glass hybrid <b>microfluidic</b> <b>devices,</b> including contact area, PDMS thickness, assembling mode, and external force. To further improve the reversible sealing of glass-PDMS-glass <b>microfluidic</b> <b>devices,</b> we propose a new scheme which exploits mechanical clamping elements to reinforce the sealing strength of glass-PDMS-glass sandwich structures. Using our scheme, the glass-PDMS-glass microchips can survive a pressure up to 400 kPa, which is comparable to the irreversibly bonded PDMS microdevices.
