However, this method fails if, for instance, the arm has to lift different weights: a greater weight needs a greater force applied for a same error on the down side, but a smaller force if the error is on the upside.

Until the mid 1980s {{this was only}} practical with the brush-type DC motor, although such DC can be supplied from an AC catenary via on-board electric power conversion. Since such conversion was not well developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century, most early electrified railways used DC and many still do, particularly rapid transit (subways) and trams. Speed was controlled by connecting the traction motors in various series-parallel combinations, by varying the traction motors' fields, and by inserting and removing starting resistances to limit <b>motor</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: AC <b>motors</b> (Alternating <b>Current</b> <b>motors)</b> have {{a simple}} {{structure}} and has higher efficiency than the DC <b>motors</b> (Direct <b>Current</b> <b>motors)</b> when operated at high speed. AC motors also provide more durable service with a lower cost compared to DC motors. Besides, AC motors can easily be supplied directly from the grid and therefore they are widely used in industry. However, when it is directly connected to the grid, traditional AC motor gets the better performance only at the speed near the synchronous speed due to its working principle. In some low cost applications where only DC is available, e. g. in electrical vehicles, the usages of AC motor are limited. It is well-known that the variable speed drive offers significant energy savings in an industrial set-up. Thus, by employing variable speed drives in industry, there exists huge scope for energy saving. The vector control scheme can give a swift response since the flux and torque are controlled separately. Here a vector control scheme based on rotor flux of induction motor is developed using MATLAB/Simulink. Keywords:Induction Machine, Vector Control.

2500|$|In newer designs {{controlled}} by a “traction computer,” each engine speed step is allotted an appropriate power output, or “kW reference”, in software. The computer compares this value with actual main generator power output, or “kW feedback”, calculated from traction <b>motor</b> <b>current</b> and main generator voltage feedback values. The computer adjusts the feedback value to match the reference value by controlling the excitation of the main generator, as described above. The governor still has control of engine speed, but the load regulator no longer plays {{a central role in}} this type of control system. However, the load regulator is retained as a “back-up” in case of engine overload.

2500|$|As the {{locomotive}} accelerates, the now-rotating motor armatures {{will start to}} generate a counter-electromotive force (back EMF, meaning the motors are also trying to act as generators), which will oppose {{the output of the}} main generator and cause traction <b>motor</b> <b>current</b> to decrease.

40|$|AC {{induction}} motor speed control has traditionally involved controlling the motor's input {{voltage and frequency}} through use of a three phase pulse-width-modulating (PWM) controlled-voltage inverter, where the inductive motor load acts as an integrating filter to smooth out the <b>motor</b> input <b>currents.</b> This report describes {{the development of a}} novel controlled-current inverter system in which the three phase <b>motor</b> input <b>currents</b> are independently monitored the inverter phases are independently switched to ensure that the three phase <b>motor</b> <b>currents</b> are balanced three phase sinusoids at all times. It is shown that a controlled-current inverter is capable of efficiently controlling an AC {{induction motor}}'s speed and torque through varying the frequency and amplitude of the <b>motor's</b> input <b>currents,</b> respectively. Prototype controlled-current inverter systems have been constructed and extensive testing carried out, with the systems' performance being compared with that obtainable from controlledvoltage inverter systems. It has been found that the controlled-current system results in lower motor losses and much reduced levels of audible motor noise. Since it is intended to develop these prototype designs into commercially viable industrial motor controllers, facilities have been incorporated into the designs that are necessary features of all modern motor controllers which are designed for use in an industrial environment...|$|R
