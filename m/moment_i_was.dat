I Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained {{that the idea of}} filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely, stating [...] "there was one <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in China and I was in this huge suite and I {{looked out the window and}} there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't believe my life... I guess I was a bit lonely and I wanted to talk to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." [...] Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side.

500|$|On 20 August 2009, Villa {{scored in}} his first {{official}} match of the season, a 3–0 Europa League qualifier against Stabæk. He followed this up with two goals against Real Valladolid on 13 September, Villa's first league goals of the 2009–10 season. He scored twice more a week later against former club Sporting Gijón in a 2–2 draw at the Mestalla, where he also performed duties as the team's captain. After the match, Villa hinted towards being unhappy with Unai Emery's managerial decisions, stating, [...] "The approach {{for the second half}} was not right. We relaxed and ended up with the same result as last year. What has happened, has happened, but their goalkeeper was good, unlike our approach, which was not good," [...] however a day later he denied being critical of Emery, pointing out that, [...] "When I talked about the approach, I was referring to the whole team, I spoke {{in the heat of the}} <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> annoyed at the way we lost two points and I said what I thought, but I have clarified everything that needed to be cleared up." ...|$|E
500|$|Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters {{found the}} finale to be [...] "breathlessly paced". However, the writer was also {{dissatisfied}} with the cliffhanger, and hoped that the second season would not increase the series' focus on Veronica's relationships. Hassenger wrote, [...] "so far, the series has eschewed the relationship angst so common in other teen-centric shows; Neptune hearts get broken, yes, but the show never stoops to that will-they-or-won't-they dynamic. Veronica is that rare television character who's too interesting for love triangles." [...] Filip Vukcevic of IGN thought that while {{the resolution of the}} murder was satisfying, it could have been better; [...] "I liked the way everything played out, but I didn't get the Sixth Sense <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hoping for. I wanted the season finale to blow my mind, instead all it got out of me was, 'Ah, I see. That's cool.'" [...] Vukcevic wrote that the pace of the season increased exponentially, and was at its best during the final episode. Both reviewers praised Rob Thomas's use of red herrings. Vukcevic felt that [...] "as the finale approaches you are led to believe that the murderer could be any one of several different people - not any easy thing to pull off convincingly. What makes good TV is audience participation. If you feel for a character or are puzzling out a mystery, you're involved. And when you're involved, you're having a good time." [...] Hassenger cited Lianne, Duncan and Logan as the main red herrings.|$|E

The actress was grateful to Davies for casting her, and joked about the prominence eventually afforded her character: [...] " [...] "For one brief <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the most important woman in the whole of the universe."

2500|$|During {{the later}} 1960s, Nikkatsu began losing its {{audience}} to TV, and its film production dropped. At this time, assistant directors {{moved on to}} TV or non-film work. In order {{to find a new}} audience, Nikkatsu president Takashi Itamochi made the decision to put the company's high production values and professional talent entirely into the [...] "pink-film" [...] (softcore pornographic) industry, which had until then been made by independent and low-budget filmmakers like Kōji Wakamatsu. Many of Nikkatsu's staff either did not return to the studio or left, not wanting to make sex films.

Plummer later told CBC News, [...] "For a <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little bit pissed off.... Because {{it made me feel}} suddenly rather old." [...] However, he admitted firing the gun [...] "frightened" [...] him because [...] "they pack the kick of an elephant" [...] and that he was [...] "terrified" [...] of the dog in the scene. Dean Norris said Plummer used this fear in his performance. The film had a $13 million budget.|$|E
2500|$|In {{connection}} with the remarks from 2002, which were recorded on tape with his knowledge, Ahenakew was later convicted in July 2005 of willfully promoting hatred against Jews. Ahenakew apologized for the remarks, saying they did not represent his beliefs {{and that he was}} [...] "caught up {{in the heat of the}} <b>moment.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> attempting to spark debate on what has been happening to our First Nations people." [...] At his trial, he later recanted his apology and blamed his outburst on his diabetes, some wine and a change in medication, a defense that was rejected by the court and he was subsequently fined $1,000. Despite this, he retained his belief that the Jews started the Second World War. Jewish groups, aboriginals and politicians later called for Ahenakew's membership in the Order of Canada to be revoked. The Governor General revoked Ahenakew's membership shortly after his trial.|$|E

Nevertheless, Jang received several award nominations for her role in the film, and won Best Actress at the 2006 Critic's Choice Awards.|$|E
