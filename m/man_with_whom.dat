5|$|The wolf is {{likened to}} a wicked man who oppresses others. The fox is likened to the devil. The farmer is likened to the godly <b>man,</b> <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> the fiend finds fault. The woods where the wolf was cheated are corrupting goods that man longs to get. The cheese {{represents}} covetousness; the well that contains it is fraud and fantasy, which draws men downwards into hell.|$|E

Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27.|$|E

5|$|As the day {{of their}} May 9, 1840, wedding approached, some family members still looked upon Houston with {{uncertainty}} and were determined to stop what they believed would be a disastrous union for Margaret. She would not be deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> she had fallen in love. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no taste for {{the hustle and bustle}} and preferred the lesser-populated Galveston. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.|$|E

While inside, she accidentally knocks over a candle, which sets fire to the entire house. Susan flees the scene, leaving behind her glass measuring cup. Though wracked with guilt, Susan is relieved to learn that Mike was not the <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> Edie was fornicating.

25|$|In 2001, Sirtis made {{a highly}} publicised {{appearance}} on the long-running British hospital drama Casualty. She played a politician with controversial views on the NHS.

25|$|The {{procedure}} of burying ashes in an urn was still unfamiliar at the time, and his urn was transported in a coffin during the funeral ceremonies. Before the funeral, an estimated 7,000 people filed past his coffin {{during the first}} two hours it lay in state, many of them veterans of the retreat from Mons. Haig, Robertson, Hamilton and Smith-Dorrien (who had travelled from France to pay his respects to a <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> he had clashed badly) were pall bearers at his funeral at Westminster Abbey—the first of a major First World War leader. His ashes were buried at Ripple five days after his death.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving the}} Rank Organisation {{in the early}} 1960s, Bogarde {{abandoned}} his heart-throb image for more challenging parts. He starred in the film Victim (1961), playing a London barrister who fights the blackmailers of a young <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> {{he has had a}} deeply emotional relationship. The young man commits suicide after being arrested for embezzlement, rather than ruin his beloved's career. In exposing the ring of extortionists, Bogarde's character risks his reputation and marriage in order to see that justice is done. Victim was the first British film to portray the humiliation gay people were exposed to via discriminatory law, and as a victimized minority; it is said to have had some effect upon the later Sexual Offences Act 1967 ending the illegal status of homosexual activity.|$|E

25|$|The {{description}} of the young <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> Beineman had last been seen alive was heard by a patrolman named Larry Mathewson, who believed the person described by Mrs. Goshe and others may be one John Norman Collins: a former fraternity member of his who had previously been interviewed but eliminated from police inquiries, and who he had himself seen riding his motorcycle around the Eastern Michigan University campus {{on the afternoon of}} July 23. When Mathewson questioned Collins on July 25 as to his movements two days earlier, he admitted that on the date in question he had been riding his Triumph Bonneville in the vicinity, and that he had stopped to converse with a former girlfriend of his while doing so (the point at which Mathewson had observed him). This former girlfriend was able to provide Mathewson with two recent photographs of Collins. When Mathewson showed these photographs to both Mrs. Goshe and her assistant, Patricia Spaulding, both women were adamant the man in the photographs was the same individual with whom Beineman had last been seen alive.|$|E
25|$|Avitus, at the Visigothic {{court in}} Burdigala, {{declared}} himself Emperor. He moved on Rome with Visigothic support which gained his acceptance by Majorian and Ricimer, commanders {{of the remaining}} army of Italy. This {{was the first time}} that a barbarian kingdom had played a key role in the imperial succession. Avitus's son-in-law Sidonius wrote propaganda to present the Visigothic king Theoderic II as a reasonable <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> a Roman regime could do business. Theoderic's payoff included precious metal from stripping the remaining public ornaments of Italy, and an unsupervised campaign in Hispania. There he not only defeated the Sueves, executing his brother-in-law Rechiar, but he also plundered Roman cities. The Burgundians expanded their kingdom in the Rhone valley and the Vandals took the remains of the Diocese of Africa. In 456 the Visigothic army was too heavily engaged in Hispania to be an effective threat to Italy, and Ricimer had just destroyed a pirate fleet of sixty Vandal ships; Majorian and Ricimer marched against Avitus and defeated him near Placentia. He was forced to become Bishop of Placentia, and died (possibly murdered) a few weeks later.|$|E
