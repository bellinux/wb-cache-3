5|$|<b>Moral</b> <b>rights</b> in United Kingdom law {{are parts}} of {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of {{the author of a}} copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements of copyright. Found in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> are the right to be identified as the author of a work, known as the right of paternity, the right to object to derogatory treatment of a work, known as the right of integrity, the right not to be identified as the author of someone else's work, and the right to privacy. The right of paternity exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E
5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no <b>moral</b> <b>rights.</b> Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} object to false {{attribution}} is {{the oldest of the}} statutory <b>moral</b> <b>rights,</b> originating (albeit in a limited form) in the Fine Arts Copyright Act 1862. Found in Section 84 of the 1988 Act, the {{right to object}} to false attribution allows individuals to avoid being named on works they are not the author of, and applies to literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, as well as films. It only applies to acts of false attribution perpetrated after 1 August 1989, and lasts for 20 years after the death of the person falsely attributed with authorship. It is infringed whenever an individual issues copies of a work to the public, exhibits them in public or broadcasts them with a false attribution.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{discourse}} of the <b>moral</b> <b>right</b> in New Zealand. It critiques the prevailing analysis on the Left, that such a phenomenon can be explained as an effect of class relations. Rather, the <b>moral</b> <b>right</b> must be examined as a form of hegemonic politics working on the terrain of the sex/gender and sexuality systems. The thesis discusses both the conditions that gave rise to the <b>moral</b> <b>right,</b> and the form and content of its discourse. It is argued that the <b>moral</b> <b>right</b> can be understood through the concept of populist moralism. On the basis of this interpretation of the <b>moral</b> <b>right</b> I put forward some suggestions on how the Left should respond to this movement...|$|R

25|$|These {{exclusive}} right of an author on his works {{are limited by}} a number of allowed free uses and one case of a compulsory license (home copying of records).

25|$|Copyright covered literary, musical, dramatic, artistic, and {{photographic}} works. The new law {{recognized the}} <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> of paternity (attribution right) {{and integrity of}} the work. Authors were granted the exclusive rights to reproduce, publish, and distribute a work, to perform dramatic and musical works in public, to record a musical work, and to produce a novel from a dramatic work or vice versa. These rights were automatic, came into existence upon {{the creation of the}} work, and were not subject to any formalities requirements.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} to the debate about <b>moral</b> <b>rights,</b> animal law is now widely taught in law schools in North America, and several prominent legal scholars support the extension of basic legal rights and personhood to at least some animals. The animals most often considered in arguments for personhood are bonobos and chimpanzees. This is supported by some animal rights academics because it would break through the species barrier, but opposed by others because it predicates moral value on mental complexity, rather than on sentience alone.|$|E

25|$|The four plaintiffs {{also went}} to court over this issue in France. Up to 1964, the French {{legislation}} treated both French authors and foreign authors exactly the same; works of both were granted exactly the same copyright protection. In a lawsuit that was ultimately decided by the French Court of Cassation in 1959, the plaintiffs won: {{the court ruled that}} works of foreign authors were entitled to copyright in France, and that the works of these four Soviet composers were thus copyrighted in France. It found their <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> violated and ordered the film to be confiscated.|$|E
25|$|An {{argument}} {{proposed by}} Bruce Friedrich, also a protectionist, holds that strict adherence to veganism harms animals, because {{it focuses on}} personal purity, rather than encouraging people to give up whatever animal products they can. For Francione, {{this is similar to}} arguing that, because human-rights abuses can never be eliminated, we should not defend human rights in situations we control. By failing to ask a server whether something contains animal products, we reinforce that the <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> of animals are a matter of convenience, he argues. He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails on its own consequentialist terms.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{accession}} of the Soviet Union to the UCC in 1973, some Soviet works were copyrighted {{in some other}} countries. One well-known case concerned {{the actions of the}} four Soviet composers Shostakovich, Khachaturian, Prokofiev, and Myaskovsky against the movie company 20th Century Fox. While the U.S. courts dismissed their case in Shostakovich v. Twentieth Century-Fox, the French Court of Cassation in 1959 ruled that works of foreign authors were entitled to copyright in France, and that the works of these four Soviet composers were thus copyrighted in France. It found their <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> violated and ordered the film to be confiscated.|$|E

25|$|The {{copyright}} {{term was}} extended from 25 years to generally 50 years p.m.a. {{for all kinds}} of works, and the law for the first time made explicit that no formalities were required for a work to be copyrighted. Anonymous or pseudonymous works were copyrighted for 50 years since their initial publication, unless the real identity of the author became known during that time and thus 50 years p.m.a. applied. The <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> to authorship, name, and integrity of the work were perpetual; and authors could only transfer usage rights on a work (but not their right to remuneration for such uses, which always remained a personal right of the author).|$|E
25|$|In reality, however, {{this is not}} correct. It is true that Nunó, Henneman and Hill did {{register}} the music with the company BMI (BMI Work #568879), with the Edward B. Marks Music Company as the listed publisher of the anthem. This might be the version that some have suggested is copyrighted in the United States. However, United States copyright law declares the Mexican anthem {{to be in the}} public domain inside the United States, since both the lyrics and music were published before 1909. Furthermore, under Mexican copyright law, Article 155 states that the government holds <b>moral</b> <b>rights,</b> but not property rights, of the national symbols, including the anthem, coat of arms and the national flag.|$|E
25|$|Lithuania {{declared}} {{independence from}} the Russian Empire on February 16, 1918. On June 12, 1920, following the brief Lithuanian–Soviet War, a Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was signed. The Soviet Union recognized Lithuania's independence and its right to the Vilnius Region. The region was fiercely contested with Poland and fell under its control after Żeligowski's Mutiny in October 1920. It was then incorporated into the Republic of Central Lithuania which was a short-lived political entity without international recognition. The region was ceded to Poland in 1922 at the Peace of Riga after the Polish–Soviet War and confirmed internationally by the League of Nations. The Lithuanians refused to recognize Polish control and continued to claim legal and <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> to the region throughout the interwar period. The Soviet Union continued to support Lithuanian claims against sovereign Poland. The Soviets supported as well Lithuania's interests in the Klaipėda Region after the Klaipėda Revolt and signed the Soviet–Lithuanian Non-Aggression Pact in 1926, later extended it to 1944.|$|E
