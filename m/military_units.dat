5|$|Following {{a similar}} form of play to Shogun: Total War, the player builds a dynastic empire in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, {{spanning}} {{the period of}} 1087 to 1453. Gameplay is both strategic and tactical, with strategy played out in turn-based fashion on a province-by-province level, while <b>military</b> <b>units</b> of varying types and capabilities fight {{against each other in}} real time on a 3D battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Mercenaries may aid {{the player}} in their campaigns in the New World. Mercenaries are not trained like {{standard}} units; instead {{they can be}} shipped from the Home City or hired from saloons for much coin, so that only economically powerful players can employ them. Most are powerful, but hiring them does not provide experience points, so mercenaries cannot effectively replace the player's standard army, and can negatively affect a player's economy if used excessively. Incidentally, along with hero/explorer units, Mercenaries were vulnerable to assassin units such as spies, agents and ninjas. In most cases, a selection of Native American tribes populate game maps, and support their own brand of <b>military</b> <b>units</b> that can be trained once an alliance has been formed. Some Native American <b>military</b> <b>units</b> use mêlée weapons, a few use indigenous ranged weapons, such as bows and arrows or atl-atls, while still others adopt ranged European gunpowder weapons. These units usually pertain to the infantry or cavalry classes, but, on maps with water, canoes are also available to the player through the dock.|$|E

5|$|Scholars of {{the late}} army {{have to contend with}} a {{dramatic}} diminution of the epigraphic record in the 3rd and 4th centuries, compared with the 1st and 2nd centuries. diplomas were no longer issued to retiring auxiliaries after 203 (most likely because almost all were already Roman citizens by then). In addition, there was a huge {{reduction in the number of}} tombstones, altars and other dedications by Roman servicemen. Official stamps of <b>military</b> <b>units</b> on building materials (e.g. tiles) are much rarer. But this trend should probably not be seen as indicating a decline in the army's administrative sophistication. Papyrus evidence from Egypt shows that <b>military</b> <b>units</b> continued to keep detailed written records in the 4th century (the vast bulk of which are lost due to organic decomposition). Most likely, the decline in inscriptions is due to changing fashion, in part influenced by the increase in barbarian recruits and the rise of Christianity. The dearth of inscriptions leaves major gaps in our understanding {{of the late}} army and renders many conclusions tentative.|$|E
