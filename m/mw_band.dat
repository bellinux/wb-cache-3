50|$|Lightning {{interferes with}} AM (amplitude modulation) radio signals {{much more than}} FM (frequency modulation) signals, {{providing}} {{an easy way to}} gauge local lightning strike intensity. To do so, one should tune a standard AM medium wave receiver to a frequency with no transmitting stations, and listen for crackles amongst the static. Stronger or nearby lightning strikes will also cause cracking if the receiver is tuned to a station. As lower frequencies propagate further along the ground than higher ones, the lower medium wave (<b>MW)</b> <b>band</b> frequencies (in the 500-600 kHz range) can detect lightning strikes at longer distances; if the longwave band (153-279 kHz) is available, using it can increase this range even further.|$|E

40|$|Exogenous {{addition}} of purified chymase, a rat serosal mast cell (RSMC) chymotryptic enzyme, results in RSMC degranulation at 37 degrees, {{but not at}} 1 degree. Chymase can cause an active site-dependent inducing event at 1 degree such that RSMC degranulation occurs if the cells are later incubated at 37 degrees. RSMC exposed to chymase or other stimuli were surface radiolabelled using 125 I and Iodo-Gen, solubilized with 1 % Nonidet- 40, and the resulting 25, 000 g supernatants analysed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. A 125 I-labelled RSMC membrane protein of approximate 90, 000 MW decreased upon exposure to either chymase or alpha-chymotrypsin (alpha-CT) for 5 min at 37 degrees or to chymase for 60 min at 1 degree. Exposure of RSMC to the secretagogues ionophore A 23187, compound 48 / 80, and anti-IgE for 5 min at 37 degrees resulted in beta-hexosaminidase (a secretory granule enzyme) release, but did not cause a detectable change in the 90, 000 MW surface-labelled protein. Lima bean trypsin inhibitor, which inhibits both the esterase and RSMC degranulation activities of chymase and alpha-CT, prevented {{the disappearance of the}} 125 I-labelled 90, 000 <b>MW</b> <b>band</b> when added with chymase or alpha-CT. Exposure of RSMC to chymase at 1 degree for 0 - 10 min, prior to {{addition of}} LBTI, led to a progressive disappearance of the 90, 000 <b>MW</b> <b>band,</b> which corresponded to the kinetics of priming for subsequent RSMC degranulation at 37 degrees.

The disappearance of the 90, 000 MW determinant in association with chymase-mediated priming for degranulation and the inability of chymase to mediate degranulation of trypsin-treated RSMC, which lack this membrane protein, suggests that it is involved in chymase-mediated RSMC degranulation...|$|E
