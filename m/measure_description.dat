40|$|This paper {{presents}} an unsupervised approach to lexical acquisition with the goodness <b>measure</b> <b>description</b> length gain (DLG) formulated following classic information theory within the minimum description length (MDL) paradigm.

The resultant segments show a nice correspondence to lexical items (in particular, words) in a natural language like English. Learning experiments on large-scale corpora (e. g., the Brown corpus) have shown the effectiveness of both the learning algorithm and the goodness measure that guides that learning. 1.

The Nigerian database was used to analyze intakes from the 2001 Nigerian Food Consumption and Nutrition Survey. The Food Intake Analysis System (FIAS) (developed by The University of Texas School of Public Health and the USDA Agricultural Research Services Food Surveys Research Group) and food and nutrient data from the USDA databases were used to aid creation of foods and recipes specific to Nigeria. USDA data had only 214 of the basic foods reported consumed by Nigerians. Researchers developed food descriptions and nutrient profiles for another 117 foods specific to Nigerian intake. An additional 14 foods were created from ingredients in the USDA database. Complete profiles of 14 nutrients were included for every new food from food composition books and tables. A total of 422 recipes were created from the USDA and Nigerian foods using the nutrient retention factor recipe methodology and the FIAS software. Recipes were kitchen tested to obtain a weight before and after cooking, {{and the weight of}} a typical serving. It was necessary to add <b>measure</b> <b>descriptions</b> and gram weights to 359 USDA and 164 Nigerian foods.

Setting A general teaching hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Method A prospective observational study was performed.

One reminder was sent. Main outcome <b>measure</b> <b>Description</b> of the needs of general practitioners was assessed. For each question and categories of comments frequency tables were made. The Fisher-exact test was used to study associations between the answers to the questions. Results In total, 149 general practitioners (32 %) responded. Most general practitioners (75 %) experienced a delay in receiving discharge medication information and preferred to receive this on the day of discharge. GPs wished to receive this information mainly through e-mail (44 %). There was a significant correlation (P =  0. 002) between general practitioners who wanted to know whether and why medication had been stopped (87 %) and changed (88 %) during hospital admission. The general practitioners (88 %) appreciated pharmacotherapeutic advices from clinical pharmacists.

40|$|Background: {{increasing}} numbers of patients are surviving critical illness, but survival {{may be associated with}} aconstellation of physical and psychological sequelae that can cause on going disability and reduced health-relatedquality of life. Limited evidence currently exists to guide the optimum structure, timing, and content of rehabilitationprogrammes. There is a need to both develop and evaluate interventions to support and expedite recovery during the post-ICU discharge period. This paper describes the construct development for a complex rehabilitationintervention intended to promote physical recovery following critical illness. The intervention is currently beingevaluated in a randomised trial (ISRCTN 09412438; funder Chief Scientists Office, Scotland). Methods: the intervention was developed using the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developingcomplex healthcare interventions. We ensured representation {{from a wide variety of}} stakeholders includingcontent experts from multiple specialties, methodologists, and patient representation. The intervention constructwas initially based on literature review, local observational and audit work, qualitative studies with ICU survivors,and brainstorming activities. Iterative refinement was aided by the publication of a National Institute for Healthand Care Excellence guideline (No. 83), publicly available patient stories (Healthtalkonline), a stakeholder event incollaboration with the James Lind Alliance, and local piloting. Modelling and further work involved a feasibility trial and development of a novel generic rehabilitation assistant (GRA) role. Several rounds of external peer review during successive funding applications also contributed to development. Results: the final construct for the complex intervention involved a dedicated GRA trained to pre-definedcompetencies across multiple rehabilitation domains (physiotherapy, dietetics, occupational therapy, and speech/language therapy), with specific training in post-critical illness issues. The intervention was from ICU discharge to 3 months post-discharge, including inpatient and post-hospital discharge elements. Clear strategies to provide information to patients/families were included. A detailed taxonomy was developed to define and describe the processes undertaken, and capture them during the trial. The detailed process <b>measure</b> <b>description,</b> together with a range of patient, health service, and economic outcomes were successfully mapped on to the modifiedCONSORT recommendations for reporting non-pharmacologic trial interventions. Conclusions: the MRC complex intervention framework was an effective guide to developing a novel post-ICUrehabilitation intervention. Combining a clearly defined new healthcare role with a detailed taxonomy of process and activity enabled the intervention to be clearly described for the purpose of trial delivery and reporting. These data will be useful when interpreting the results of the randomised trial, will increase internal and external trial validity, and help others implement the intervention if the intervention proves clinically and cost effective...|$|E
