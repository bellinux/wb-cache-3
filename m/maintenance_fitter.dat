40|$|ABSTRACT: New {{smartphones}} generation {{provided with}} webcams, tactile screen and internet connection allow adaptation {{of new technologies}} and computer applications {{to this kind of}} devices. Augmented reality technology becomes widespread and more used each time by everyone. Augmented reality (AR) seeks creating virtual objects in user interface which superimpose over the physical environment. Equipment maintenance as well as training tasks are both excellent fields for developing augmented reality applications, in fact, several apps of Augmented Reality have been performed in very specific systems and complex (aircrafts, military equipment [...] .). In this paper our aim is making this technology approachable for applications and tasks quite common to everybody, so two prototypes have been developed: one smartphones-based mobile AR system and another video see-through based AR system which will guide the user step by step through installation of the V-brakes system, change of cartridge shoes and adjustment of tension cable. An easy interface based of several cards containing markers with codified sequences based in 3 D models for performing <b>maintenance,</b> is <b>fitted</b> to the bike handlebars. Usability study results illustrate the feasibility of the prototype in both versions considering use of the smartphone for domestic and user tasks meanwhile virtual glasses are advised for more complex maintenance which may require use of both hands...|$|R

40|$|The Fit {{framework}} {{is a well}} established tool for creating early and automated acceptance tests. Available Eclipse plug-ins like FITpro support for new requirements and new code writing of test data and creation of test stubs quite well. In our project we faced the problem, that a large legacy system should undergo a major refactoring. Before this, acceptance tests had {{to be added to}} the system to ensure equivalent program behavior before and after the changes. Writing acceptance tests manually for existing code is very laborious, cumbersome and very costly. However reverse generation of fit tests based on legacy code is not foreseen in the current Fit framework, and there are no other tools available to do so. So we decided to develop a tool which allows generation of the complete Fit test code and test specification based on existing code. The tool also includes automatic refactoring of test data when refactoring production code and vice versa, when changing the Fit test specification, it also updates production code accordingly. This reduces the <b>maintenance</b> effort of <b>Fit</b> tests in general and we hope, this will help to spread the usage of Fit for acceptance and integration testing even more...|$|R

40|$|Introduction of {{personal}} protective equipment (PPE) {{in the process of}} quantitative exposure and risk assessment should be addressed carefully. PPE which have been designed and manufactured according to CE-criteria and have proved to pass relevant test criteria, can be classified as 'proper functioning'. However, test criteria for PPE are not equal to levels of protection which can be achieved in the workplace, because actual workplace exposure scenarios, <b>fit,</b> <b>maintenance</b> and storage may differ substantially from the test conditions. The proper use of PPE is related to issues which form a part of a PPE-programme. Such a programme should be implemented in a company to ensure selection of proper PPE and information, training and instruction of employees how to wear PPE properly. Assigned protection factors (APFs) for different designs of respiratory protective devices (RPD) have been introduced to quantify effectiveness of RPD in the workplace. Similar APFs are proposed for dermal protection (gloves and clothing). In general biological monitoring studies show lower reduction of internal exposure than estimated by reduction of external exposure. Therefore, conservative estimates of protection by PPE, i. e. the lowest APFs, are proposed for risk assessment purposes if 'proper use of proper functioning' PPE as part of a PPE-programme cannot be demonstrated. © 2001 British Occupational Hygiene Society.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the congruence of an organisation to its intended target markets. It was hypothesised that the internal activities of an organisation are, potentially, structured {{in response to}} its market dynamics with the ultimate aim of achieving the organisational objective(s). Market fit has been conceptualised to represent the fit of an organisation to its operating market environment. The information {{for this study was}} collected from senior marketing decision makers, using a self-administered questionnaire. The sample comprised 216 companies from a mix of industries and organisational sizes in Australia. There is evidence to suggest that the association of market orientation and business performance is inconsistent under different business operating circumstances, due to the exclusion of the influence of key environmental moderators. The model of market fit attempts to overcome this condition. The results suggest that market fit is associated with measures of business performance, and the levels of association are different from those related to the market orientation measures, reflecting the influence of moderators. The categories of environmental moderators contributing at different levels to the market fit measure include: (1) marketing planning, (2) implementation of marketing decisions, (3) market orientation, (4) market strength, (5) generic strategies, (6) organisational culture, (7) familiarity with the marketing audit, and (8) the external environment. The marketing audit procedure has been recommended as a tool to assist with the establishment and <b>maintenance</b> of market <b>fit.</b> The results {{of this study indicate that}} organisational familiarity with, and the conduct of, the marketing audit periodically are low, and that market fit may be a better predictor of business performance, than is market orientation...|$|R
40|$|Background Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease {{accounting}} for 50 – 100 million annual cases globally. Laos and Thailand are countries in south-east Asia where {{the disease is}} endemic in both urban and rural areas. Household water storage containers, which are favourable breeding sites for dengue mosquitoes, are common in these areas, due to intermittent or limited access to water supply. This study assessed the effect of household water management and socio-demographic risk factors on Aedes aegypti infestation of water storage containers. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 239 households in Laos (124 suburban and 115 rural), and 248 households in Thailand (127 suburban and 121 rural) was conducted. Entomological surveys alongside semi-structured interviews and observations were conducted to obtain information on Ae. aegypti infestation, socio-demographic factors and water management. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models {{were used to assess}} risk factors associated with Ae. aegypti pupal infestation. Results Household water management rather than socio-demographic factors {{were more likely to be}} associated with the infestation of water containers with Ae. aegypti pupae. Factors that was significantly associated with Ae. aegypti infestation were tanks, less frequent cleaning of containers, containers without lids, and containers located outdoors or in toilets/bathrooms. Conclusions Associations between Ae. aegypti pupae infestation, household water management, and socio-demographic factors were found, with risk factors for Ae. aegypti infestation being specific to each study setting. Most of the containers did not have lids, larvicides, such as temephos was seldom used, and containers were not cleaned regularly; factors are facilitating dengue vector proliferation. It is recommended that, in Lao villages, health messages should promote proper use and <b>maintenance</b> of tightly <b>fitted</b> lids, and temephos in tanks, which were the most infested containers. Recommendations for Thailand are that small water containers should be cleaned weekly. Furthermore, in addition to health messages on dengue control provided to communities, attention should be paid to larval control for indoor containers in rural villages. Temephos or other immature control measures such as the use of pyriproxyfen, antilarval bacteria, or larvivorous fish should be used where temephos resistance is prevalent. Dengue control is not possible without additional adult mosquito control and community participation...|$|R
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsAllen M. FeatherstoneAs the U. S. {{economy has}} changed, {{the use of}} diesel {{vehicles}} has increased. With this increase, has come {{an increase in the}} demand of highly trained technicians to work on those vehicles. North Arkansas College of Harrison, AR is looking for opportunities to keep its program offerings current with the educational demands of its potential students. During the last few years, North Arkansas College has received requests to start a diesel vehicle maintenance program. This thesis analyzes the feasibility of a diesel vehicle maintenance program at North Arkansas College. To determine the feasibility of such a program, all major aspects of the potential program must be considered and analyzed. The key questions addressed are: what is the interest level in the community for a diesel vehicle maintenance program, what are the major capital costs of starting the program, what would the potential operating budget resemble, and how would the program fit into the current field of area diesel maintenance programs? To study the feasibility of a potential diesel vehicle maintenance program at North Arkansas College, four steps were completed. First, a survey was developed that measured the interest from potential students, prospective employers, and interested community members from the potential market of North Arkansas College. Second, research was done to understand how a potential diesel vehicle <b>maintenance</b> program would <b>fit</b> into the current marketplace of established diesel maintenance programs. This was done by researching and comparing area programs to the type of programs that North Arkansas College offers and the possible model of a potential diesel vehicle maintenance program. Next, research was conducted to estimate the capital costs of starting a diesel vehicle maintenance program, as well as the potential operating budget. This was done by developing blueprints of a potential floor plan, a building to house the program, and the potential areas of study in the program. Based on these blueprints, actual bids and estimates were collected to calculate potential capital and operating costs. Finally, analysis was conducted to determine if the outcomes of a potential diesel vehicle maintenance program would fulfill the mission of North Arkansas College. The analysis of the feasibility of a diesel vehicle maintenance program at North Arkansas College reveals that there is interest from all three parts of the community in starting a diesel vehicle maintenance program. The research also revealed that the program would be a fit in the marketplace if it was an affordable, three semester program that covered the basics of the diesel powered vehicle. Also, research of the potential costs and revenues of the program reveals that the program would be sustainable. Finally, a diesel vehicle maintenance program would have much synergy with the current programs already offered at North Arkansas College. In the end, the results suggest that it is worthwhile to move forward towards starting a diesel vehicle maintenance program...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide food {{production}} {{is done in}} different types of agricultural production systems. The main difference is whether it is an intensive or extensive system. The agave production in Mexico has been developed in these two different ways. Firstly, agave for tequila has been produced in intensive capi-talist systems with large amount of inputs achieving large production. However, this system has caused important environmental and social problems to the local inhabitants. Secondly, agave for mezcal has been produced in extensive systems within a subsistence peasant culture. The main pro-duction system is harvesting wild agave from its natural environment and it achieves very low yields. This system is environmentally compatible and benefits the local inhabitants because it fits into the peasant culture. In this project I compared the sustainability of these systems. I focused on the mezcal production in some communities of Guerrero. The rural situation in this area, as in most rural regions of Mexico, is very problematic. Agricultural production is not profitable for peasants and there is large unemployment. For these reasons, poverty and migration to urban centres increase, and with this, the peasant subsistence culture is lost. However, peasants in these Guerrero communities {{who are involved in}} the mezcal production can support their families by mezcal’s profits {{and at the same time}} produce their own food which enables them to preserve their peasant subsistence culture. Nevertheless, since the agave production is very low, few peasants benefit from the mezcal production. This project aimed to study if the type of agave production system can improve the peasant’s liveli-hood of the region by achieving a sustainable rural development. In order to do this, the agave produc-tion must be increased in a sustainable way and the production system must fits into the peasant sub-sistence culture. There are different types of agave production systems. In this study, I characterized the agave produc-tion systems in two main categories based in the agave density that each system can reach: low den-sity systems and high density systems. The first ones involve harvesting agave from its natural envi-ronment. The yield depends on the agave density in the forest. Nowadays, the density is very low be-cause it has been overharvested in the last decades. However, there are agave planting programmes paid by governmental subsidies to increase the density in the forest. The advantages of these systems are that they preserve the forest and do not involve <b>maintenance</b> labour. This <b>fits</b> into the peasant sub-sistence culture because peasants have time to produce their own food and use other forest’s re-sources. The high density systems achieve very high yields but do not preserve the forest. There are two sys-tems in this category: monocultures and seed spreading system. Monocultures do not fit into the peas-ant subsistence culture because of several reasons. Profits are earned after the harvest (8 - 10 years after planting the agave), it requires large investments for the planting, fertilizers, pesticides, risks for pests are very high and large labour maintenance are required. In contrast, the seed spreading system does fit into the peasant subsistence culture. Profits can be earned every year because a small annual har-vest is possible, risks of pests are smaller, fewer inputs are required and little maintenance labour is necessary. The description and comparison of the production systems showed that there are two potential solu-tions to improve the peasant’s livelihood of the region by achieving a sustainable rural development. Firstly, increase agave in the forest by agave planting programmes. However, governmental subsidies are required. Secondly, change part of the forest into a seed spreading system. The fraction of the for-est with a seed spreading system that gives the same profits as all forest planted with agave is 11 %. The results of this study give insight about the sustainability and suitability to the peasant subsistence culture of the agave production systems in the region. Nevertheless, since this project was based on a literature research, it is necessary that, for further research, implementation of the acquired knowledge is done in the region. ...|$|R
