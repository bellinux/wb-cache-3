40|$|In {{accordance}} {{with the objective of}} the present invention, the active control of unsteady combustion induced oscillations in a combustion chamber fired by a suitable fuel and oxidizer mixture, such as a hydrocarbon fuel and air mixture, is provided by restructuring and moving the position of the <b>main</b> <b>flame</b> front and thereby increasing the transport time and displacing the pressure wave further away from the in-phase relationship with the periodic heat release. The restructuring and repositioning of the <b>main</b> <b>flame</b> are achieved by utilizing a pilot flame which is pulsed at a predetermined frequency corresponding to less than about one-half the frequency of the combustion oscillation frequency with the duration of each pulse being sufficient to produce adequate secondary thermal energy to restructure the <b>main</b> <b>flame</b> and thereby decouple the heat release from the acoustic coupling so as to lead to a reduction in the dynamic pressure amplitude. The pulsating pilot flame produces a relatively small and intermittently existing flame front in the combustion zone that is separate from the oscillating <b>main</b> <b>flame</b> front but which provides the thermal energy necessary to effectively reposition the location of the oscillating <b>main</b> <b>flame</b> front out of the region in the combustion zone where the acoustic coupling can occur with the <b>main</b> <b>flame</b> and thereby effectively altering the oscillation-causing phase relationship with the heat of combustion...|$|E

Present days, advanced efficient emission (NOx, CO and UHC) reduction combustion technologies are acknowledged for using the lean premixed combustion system. To support continuous development of eco-friendly combustion system, a 4 th generation dry low NOx prototype downscaled burner (designed and manufactured by Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery AB) has been researched experimentally and numerically. The research burner has multiple stages, which includes a central Pilot (named as RPL/Rich-Premixed Lean) stages, Pilot stage and Main stage. The RPL combustion chamber holds the primary flame, which produces the temperature and high concentration of radicals. The radicals and hot product {{is reached to the}} forward stagnation point of the <b>Main</b> <b>flame</b> anchoring point. Swirled reactant mixture is delivered to the Main combustion zone and a strong recirculation zone is developed. The recirculated product is moved to the <b>Main</b> <b>flame</b> root and ignites the fresh mixture. The <b>Main</b> <b>flame</b> was visualized by applying Chemiluminescence and 2 D OH-PLIF imaging techniques. Emission measurement was performed to quantify the burner operability and emission competency. Burner stage fuel splits are varied and their effects on flame stability was monitored thoroughly. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis was performed to understand the flow field and compare the experimental results with numerical analysis. CFD simulation can help to identify the approximate NOx formation region and flame locations inside the burner. RPL flow and Pilot fuel split shows significant contribution towards flame stabilization as experienced from experiment and CFD. A high temperature B-type thermocouple was positioned at the liner exit to measure the exhaust gas temperature. Numerical calculation prediction and measured temperatures showed good qualitative agreement. From the present experimental and numerical research, it is evident that the downscaled prototype gas turbine burner demonstrates a wide flame stability for various operating condition.

40|$|The {{trapped vortex}} {{combustor}} concept provides a simple design for flame stabilization by trapping a pilot flame inside a cavity instead of exposing {{it to the}} mainstream. Under some circumstances, the combustor may operate in a high-spinning motion (for example, when it is installed in a spin-stabilized ramjet projectile), in which the spinning rate can {{be as high as}} 30, 000 rpm. The objective {{of this study is to}} numerically investigate the effects of high-spinning motion on the trapped vortex combustor, including the cavity vortex dynamics, fuel-air mixing, and combustion performance. Numerical computations have been performed with the Reynolds stress model for turbulence and the eddy dissipation model for combustion in a rotating reference frame. The results of the spinning trapped vortex combustor show that the Coriolis effects dominate the flow in the cavity whenit is subjectedto ahigh-spinning motion (30, 000 rpm). The vortex breakdowninthe cavity brings strong three-dimensional flow and promotes fuel-air mixing so that a stronger cavity pilot flame is generated. But, the effect of the centrifugal force also generates a short recirculation zone in the main combustor and concentrates the fuel stream on the combustor axis, which in turn impairs fuel-air mixing and leads to a longer <b>main</b> combustor <b>flame...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} a {{miniature}} ramjet combustor using gaseous methane fuel for Mach 2. 5 has been conducted. The main challenges stem mainly from the insufficient space for mixing and burning, short residence time, and the flame stabilization. Impossible utilization of relatively large air-blast fuel injectors provides more difficulties for the design. The trapped vortex combustor, as a novel way of flameholding by trapping the pilot flame inside a cavity instead of exposing it to the mainstream, is selected. Three main parts are studied numerically, which include the cold flowfield characteristics, the fuel-injection schemes, and the overall combustion performance. The {{results show that the}} drag coefficient can helptodetermine the optimum cavity size for trappingastable vortex. Injecting all the fuel inthe cavity always leads to an overly fuel-rich condition, whereas injecting in front of the cavity with a momentum flux ratio q between 0. 61 and 1. 0 can successfully achieve stoichiometric mixing in the cavity. However, compared to nonreacting fuel mixing, the combustion performance is found to be more sensitive to the value of q. Among the cases studied, the one with a small q of about 0. 61 has more intense pilot <b>flames</b> andshorter <b>main</b> combustor <b>flames.</b> The effectsofangled injection, upstream injection location, and the combustor length based on the found q are also investigated...|$|R
