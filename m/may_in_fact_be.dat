5|$|Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) {{can be used}} to biopsy bone lesions, {{once found}} on an X-ray or other scan. Such tests can be vital in diagnosis and can also prevent unnecessary treatment and invasive surgery. Conversely, FNA biopsy of tumors of the parathyroid gland is not recommended for diagnosing parathyroid carcinoma and <b>may</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> harmful, as the needle can puncture the tumor, leading to dissemination and the possible spread of cancerous cells.|$|E
5|$|Sam's slacker boyfriend Ben (Rasmus Hardiker) {{goes through}} {{numerous}} jobs and {{interests in the}} first series, such as taking a circus skills course, and a short-lived shelf-stacking job, however these apparent jobs require a recurring amount of forty pounds (which is gained from Rick through Sam's pleas), which <b>may</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> used to purchase recreational drugs, meaning the jobs and interests may not exist at all.|$|E

5|$|Archaea {{can also}} be commensals, benefiting from an {{association}} without helping or harming the other organism. For example, the methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii {{is by far the}} most common archaean in the human flora, making up about one in ten of all the prokaryotes in the human gut. In termites and in humans, these methanogens <b>may</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> mutualists, interacting with other microbes in the gut to aid digestion. Archaean communities also associate with a range of other organisms, such as on the surface of corals, and in the region of soil that surrounds plant roots (the rhizosphere).|$|E
5|$|Mulder, Scully, Asekoff, and Fazekas are rescued, {{but there}} is no sign of Glaser or the other {{creature}}. Upon leaving the forest, Mulder states that the creature <b>may,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>be</b> an evolved version of the first Spanish conquistadors who had first settled in the forest 450 years before. Although Kinsley finds it ridiculous, Mulder believes that centuries of seclusion could be adequate for such drastic adaptations to happen. Afterwards, Mulder realizes that the creatures presume others' presence in their territory as threatening and rushes to the hotel room where Scully is packing her things. After ascertaining that she is finished packing, he firmly urges her to vacate the room, which she does. The camera then pans under the bed where a pair of red eyes open.|$|E
5|$|Argentodites is a {{possible}} multituberculate mammal from the Cretaceous of Argentina. The single species, Argentodites coloniensis, is known from a single blade-like fourth lower premolar (p4) from the La Colonia Formation, which is mostly or entirely Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) in age. The p4 is 4.15mm long and bears eight cusps on its upper margin and long associated ridges on both sides. The enamel consists of prisms that are completely or partly surrounded by a sheath and that are on average 6.57m apart. Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, who described and named the fossil in 2007, regarded it as a multituberculate, perhaps a cimolodontan—and thus, {{a member of a}} mostly Laurasian (northern) group and an immigrant to Argentina from North America—on the basis of the shape of the tooth and features of its enamel. In 2009, however, two teams argued that Argentodites <b>may</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> close to or identical with Ferugliotherium, a member of the small Gondwanan (southern) group Gondwanatheria; although their relationships are disputed, gondwanatheres may themselves be multituberculates.|$|E

50|$|T.F. O'Rahilly {{speculated that}} Mug Nuadat <b>may</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> have <b>been</b> the god Nuada {{rather than an}} actual {{historical}} person. Equally {{it could be that}} Éogan Mór was the earthly representation of the god.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by Sam Newton that Ecgric <b>may</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> identical to Eni's son Æthelric, whose descendants became kings of East Anglia. Æthelric's son Ealdwulf ruled from about 664 to 713. After Ecgric's death, three other sons of Eni ruled in succession before Ealdwulf, an indication that Raedwald's line was extinct. Æthelric's marriage to Hereswith suggests that {{it was expected that}} he would rule East Anglia and he may have been promoted by Edwin before 632. Æthelric was apparently dead by 647, at which time Anna was already ruling and Hereswith had gone to Gaul to lead a religious life. It has therefore been argued that Æthelric and Ecgric were in fact the same person, a suggestion that is disputed by the historian Barbara Yorke, who notes that the two names are too distinct to be compatible.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that a cycle occurs in which {{volcanic}} activity at the summit is dominant for several hundred years, after which activity shifts to the rift zones for several more centuries, {{and then back to}} the summit again. Two cycles have been clearly identified, each lasting 1,500–2,000years. This cyclical behavior is unique to Mauna Loa among the Hawaiian volcanoes. Between about 7,000 and 6,000years ago Mauna Loa was largely inactive. The cause of this cessation in activity is not known, and no known similar hiatus has been found at other Hawaiian volcanoes except for those currently in the post-shield stage. Between 11,000 and 8,000years ago, activity was more intense than it is today. However, Mauna Loa's overall rate of growth has probably begun to slow over the last 100,000years, and the volcano <b>may</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> nearing the end of its tholeiitic basalt shield-building phase.|$|E
5|$|The Iago sparrow {{was once}} thought to be most closely related to the rufous sparrows, a group of species within the genus Passer which live in similar {{habitats}} on continental Africa. Though the Iago sparrow is closest to the rufous sparrows in appearance, it has a number of crucial differences in morphology and behavior, and is separated by thousands of kilometres. It <b>may</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> more closely related to the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow. In Cape Verde it occurs on all but one island, and on most of them it is quite common. The Iago sparrow occurs in most habitats on available in its range, such as lava plains, rocky hills, and gorges; however, the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow are typically present instead in denser settlements and richer cultivated areas respectively. Because the Iago sparrow is not under any serious threats, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} the dusky shark extends worldwide, albeit discontinuously, in {{tropical}} and warm-temperate waters. In the western Atlantic Ocean, it is found from Massachusetts and the Georges Bank to southern Brazil, including the Bahamas and Cuba. In the eastern Atlantic Ocean, {{it has been reported}} from the western and central Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and possibly elsewhere including Portugal, Spain, Morocco, and Madeira. In the Indian Ocean, it is found off South Africa, Mozambique, and Madagascar, with sporadic records in the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and perhaps the Red Sea. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs off Japan, mainland China and Taiwan, Vietnam, Australia, and New Caledonia in the west, and from southern California to the Gulf of California, around Revillagigedo, and possibly off northern Chile in the east. Records of dusky sharks from the northeastern and eastern central Atlantic, and around tropical islands, <b>may</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> of Galapagos sharks. Mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite evidence suggest that Indonesian and Australian sharks represent distinct populations.|$|E
5|$|While in the tunnels, Melnick gets a burn on {{the back}} of his neck {{suggesting}} a chemical leak. However, the test of the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that the tunnels run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water leakages from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten away like the other man. His condition proves that he did not kill the man and that there <b>may,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>be</b> a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, wrapped in plastic. It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem in the subway.|$|E
25|$|The {{compound}} glycyrrhizin (or glycyrrhizic acid), {{found in}} liquorice, {{has been proposed}} as being useful for liver protection in tuberculosis therapy, but evidence does not support this use, which <b>may</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> harmful.|$|E
