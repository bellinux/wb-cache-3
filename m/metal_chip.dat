50|$|As the MA-5 capsule {{reached the}} Canton Island station, Mercury Control {{realized}} that the attitude control system was malfunctioning. A <b>metal</b> <b>chip</b> in a fuel supply line had caused one of the clockwise roll thrusters to fail. The failed thruster allowed the spacecraft to drift from its normal attitude. This drift caused the automatic stabilization and control system to correct the spacecraft attitude. The spacecraft would swing back into the normal 34-degree orbital attitude, and the sequence would start again. The spacecraft repeated this drift and correction process nine times before retrofire. It did it once more between retrofire and the receipt of the 0.05 g (0.49 m/s²) light telemetry signal. The remaining thrusters used 9.5 lb of fuel to keep the spacecraft properly aligned during the second orbit. Each loss of attitude cost over 1 lb of fuel {{as compared with the}} entire first orbit consumption of only 1.5 lb.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{concerns with}} the <b>metal</b> <b>chip</b> size monitoring method in deep-hole machining process. Monitoring {{and control of}} the chip size and shape is very important in deep-hole machining because a visual monitoring is obstructed by hidden chip passages. Yet, for the process, any chip size which may result in passages clogging will result in a failure of machining process. In this manufacturing process monitoring system, the three principal components for chip status monitoring have been investigated: the sensing chip concentration, the signal processing, and the classification (decision making). A new sensing system and monitoring method have been investigated and proposed for use. An inductive proximity sensor was selected and used for data acquisition (sensing), and a personal computer utilized for signal processing. As a monitoring method, the expert system of deep-hole machining control has been suggested for decision making based on the sensing system signal.

To accomplish this goal we first brainstormed various possible ideas and performed small scale tests the best ones. After further review we determined the best solution to this problem was a design that involved a cycling magnetic backing that would pull steel out of the flow and drop it into a separate bin.

40|$|Modern {{high speed}} {{machining}} {{would not be}} possible without the use of metalworking fluids (MWFs). MWFs perform a number of useful functions like cooling and lubrication. They also assist with <b>metal</b> <b>chip</b> evacuation and short-term corrosion protection. It is estimated that 90 million U. S. gallons of water-soluble MWF concentrate are manufactured annually in the U. S. alone to meet the above needs. MWFs become process effluents when the accumulation of contaminants such as extraneous oil, particulate debris from machining operations, and bacteria negatively impact functionality. One to two billion U. S. gallons of oily wastewater result annually from the use of MWFs. Reducing this environmental footprint has become an important objective for both manufacturers and end-users of MWFs. Oil-containing MWFs are conventionally formulated to be highly stable emulsions. These emulsions are difficult to maintain, recycle, and treat (Byers, 1994). Preliminary work indicated that transiently stable emulsions can provide comparable lubrication, while also potentially being easier to maintain and recycle. They also offer fewer problems for waste treatment than their stable counterparts. This report focuses on a rational approach to designing such transiently stable emulsions by elucidating the important factors affecting lubrication, cooling, and phase separation.

40|$|AbstractMachining cost {{is a most}} {{important}} factor for manufacturing a product. The machining cost for each machine tool is often estimated from {{the total cost of}} a factory according to the conventional method used for industrial management. The total income and expenditure of a factory can be obtained, however the operation status of machine tools is different. That is to say that an accurate machining cost for each part can’t be estimated and then cutting conditions realizing minimum machining cost cannot be discussed before a real machining operation. Hence, an estimation method of machining cost is proposed with using ABC (activity-based costing). The activities related to electric consumption of a machine tool, coolant, lubricant oil, cutting tool and <b>metal</b> <b>chip</b> are considered for total machining cost in this research. Based on the estimation method, the calculation method of cutting conditions achieving minimum machining cost is introduced and discussed. An adequate cutting condition can be obtained by calculating an approximate equation with using least-square method and exploring a cutting condition achieving the minimum machining cost with using iterative calculation in this paper. The feasibility of the proposed estimation method of machining cost and the calculation method of cutting conditions achieving minimum machining cost is demonstrated through some case studies...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effect of three different acids (sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid and nitric acid), on three different clay deposit samples, to recycle used lubricating oil. To achieve this objective, filtration of the used oil was carried out first to remove impurities like: sand, <b>metal</b> <b>chip</b> and other micro impurities using: Buncher funnel, filter papers and vacuum pump. The filtered oil was allowed to settle for twelve hours (12 hrs), before being centrifuged for another 20 mins at 10000 rpm so any particles in the oil can settle and be decanted. Next, the oil was preheated to degrade some additives, which helped to reduce the work load when acid was added. 100 ml of the preheated oil was measured and treated with 10 ml of various acids (Sulphuric acid, Nitric acid and hydrochloric acid) in varied strengths, and then allowed to stand for thirty minutes in a separating funnel before being allowed {{to pass through the}} bed of clay using a vacuum pump. Caustic Soda was then added to the extracted oil to help neutralize the acid in the oil. The resulting oil was slightly dark in colour. Tests carried out were: flash point, cloud point, pour point, viscosity index, sulphur content and water content.

40|$|A new {{approach}} of solid-state direct recycling <b>metal</b> <b>chip</b> was examined scientifically by applying hot press forging process technique. The {{study is to}} determine the effect of different chip sizes (S), pre-compaction cycle (PCC) and holding time (t) on the mechanical and physical properties of the recycled chip of AA 6061 aluminium alloy in hot press forging process. Full-factorial design coupled with response surface methodology (RSM) design was used based on the face centred, central composite design (CCD) to evaluate the effects of three main parameters as mentioned above. The mechanical properties of recycled chips were determined by measuring the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS) whereas the physical properties were studied by examining the microhardness, microstructure, and the relative density of the recycled chip. Finally, both results of mechanical and physical properties of the recycled chips were compared with the original AA 6061 aluminium billet. The experimental results indicates that, hot pressed AA 6061 recycled aluminium alloy using chip size (S=larger), pre-compaction cycle (PCC= 4 times), and holding time (t= 120 minutes) produced the higher value of UTS and YS at 122. 33 MPa and 120. 45 MPa respectively, which is 42 % of as-received billet. It was also found that larger S used with higher number of PPC and longer the t will produce better mechanical and physical properties of the recycled AA 6061 chip where t has most influential effect throughout the process followed by PCC, and S. Those results were supported by RSM optimization technique giving 98 % of desirability index as both solution predicted was close to the experimental value of the reference specimen. Therefore, this study can be used as an alternative technique for recycling aluminium chips instead of conventional method which it has been carried out below the melting phase temperature...|$|E
