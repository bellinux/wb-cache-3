2500|$|McGee has a {{reputation}} for telling tall tales, and there are occasional jokes linking this propensity to his name [...] "Fibber". [...] In the episode [...] "Fibber Changes His Name" [...] (March 25, 1941), he {{goes so far as to}} claim that [...] "Fibber" [...] is his actual given name and not just a nickname. [...] According to McGee, [...] "I was named after <b>my</b> <b>fourth</b> cousin, Walpole J. Fimmer [...]. but the minister who christened me had a cold in his head." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 Sebastian {{gained a}} {{contract}} to release his previous album The Memphis Album in the US. The release was later changed to only include three of the soul cover songs from The Memphis Album, with the other eight tracks being songs which he had recorded for his fifth Australian album. Sebastian stated {{in an interview with}} the Sunday Telegraph, [...] "They were originally just going to release The Memphis Album, but I don't want to be known as a covers artist here. It was all right in Australia, because it was <b>my</b> <b>fourth</b> album, but I want some originals on there." [...] The album was set to be released in mid-2009, under the title Like It Like That.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the {{thinking}} behind titling the album 'Pulse', Braxton explained to UK R writer Pete Lewis – Deputy Editor of Blues & Soul – in May 2010: [...] "It comes from when I got ill. I went into cardic rehab, {{and there was}} this older lady there. She was like 'What are you doing here so young? It must have been your heart. You know what? This is <b>my</b> <b>fourth</b> heart-attack and you're so young, you can't be AFRAID! You can't stop LIVING!'... Then she told me how she'd just got back from holiday with her 40-year-old boyfriend! And because I'd lost hope – the doctors had told me I'd never be able to record again – her conversation was like that heartbeat, that pulse that gave me back the love of life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Misfortune quickly dashed Madetoja's hopes: while {{passing through}} Paris {{on his way}} to Southern France, his suitcase—which {{contained}} the Fourth Symphony's nearly-completed manuscript—was stolen at a railway station in the city; the suitcase was never recovered. With both his inspiration and memory in decline, Madetoja {{does not appear to have}} taken seriously the idea of a reconstruction of the lost score, notwithstanding his (unsuccessful) 1941 application for a stipend to [...] "finish <b>my</b> <b>fourth</b> symphony that is underway". Indeed, when a student of his, , asked whether Madetoja could recreate the symphony, he replied cryptically, [...] "Do you think that I could rewrite something that a thief has taken"? By January 1942, he was hospitalized for alcoholism. During his treatment, Madetoja occupied himself with old issues of Musiikkitieto magazine and, when he came across a story about his time in Runni, he did not recall having composed the Fourth, telling his doctor and friend, Jalmari Lydecken, [...] "I wonder if anything has been written at all"? ...|$|E
2500|$|Cross {{played for}} the St Kilda Saints in Australia as a batsman in the 2008/09 season. He won the prestigious Jack Ryder Medal, {{presented}} to the Player of the Year in the Victorian Premier League. During his stint with the club, Cross scored 541runs {{at an average of}} 41, with a highest score of 111. Although primarily a batsman, Cross occasionally bowled, taking six wickets with best figures of 4/41. He was surprised to receive the award, and said that [...] "This was <b>my</b> <b>fourth</b> spell with St Kilda and each time I've thoroughly enjoyed my cricket. I set myself a challenge this winter of focusing on my batting, improving my technique and doing my best for the club. Everything seemed to click and I was very happy with my own performance and that of the team. My focus now is to continue to do well during Lancashire’s pre-season fixtures, and push for first team selection." [...] Despite his promising winter, Cross was less successful in the 2009 season than desired: he did not play any first-class cricket and scored fewer runs in the one-day competitions than hoped. However, Cross captained Lancashire's secondXI and was a regular in their top order. Under his leadership, the team progressed to the final of the Second XI Championship and the semi-final of the SecondXI Trophy.|$|E
