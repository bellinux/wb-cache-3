5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
25|$|With older {{supercharged}} aircraft, {{the pilot}} must continually adjust the throttle {{to maintain the}} required <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> during ascent or descent. The pilot must also take care to avoid over-boosting the engine and causing damage. In contrast, modern turbocharger systems use an automatic wastegate, which controls the <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> within parameters preset by the manufacturer. For these systems, {{as long as the}} control system is working properly and the pilot's control commands are smooth and deliberate, a turbocharger cannot over-boost the engine and damage it.|$|E
25|$|In {{automotive}} applications, 'boost' {{refers to}} the amount by which intake <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> exceeds atmospheric pressure. This {{is representative of the}} extra air pressure that is achieved over what would be achieved without the forced induction.

25|$|The first CART test session {{began on}} December 19, 2000. Kenny Bräck, a former Indy Racing League driver (who had raced {{previously}} at Texas in the IRL) {{was the first}} driver {{to take to the}} track. The target speeds were set at 225mph. Bräck completed over 100 laps, with a top lap over 221mph. CART chief steward J. Kirk Russell, track officials, Bräck, and Team Rahal expressed satisfaction with the test and the data collected. CART set its rules package for the race as utilizing 37 inHG <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> (down from 40) and installing the Hanford device on all rear wings.|$|E
25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the {{crankshaft}} position, intake manifold temperature, intake <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> (or intake air volume), throttle position, fuel mixture via the oxygen sensor, detonation via a knock sensor, and {{exhaust gas temperature}} sensors. The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|E
25|$|In {{petrol engine}} {{turbocharger}} applications, boost pressure {{is limited to}} keep the entire engine system, including the turbocharger, inside its thermal and mechanical design operating range. Over-boosting an engine frequently causes damage to the engine {{in a variety of}} ways including pre-ignition, overheating, and over-stressing the engine's internal hardware. For example, to avoid engine knocking (also known as detonation) and the related physical damage to the engine, the intake <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> must not get too high, thus the pressure at the intake manifold of the engine must be controlled by some means. Opening the wastegate allows the excess energy destined for the turbine to bypass it and pass directly to the exhaust pipe, thus reducing boost pressure. The wastegate can be either controlled manually (frequently seen in aircraft) or by an actuator (in automotive applications, it is often controlled by the engine control unit).|$|E

40|$|A {{mean value}} {{model of a}} diesel engine with VGT and EGR is {{developed}} and validated. The intended model applications are system analysis, simulation, and development of model-based control systems. The goal is to construct a model that describes the dynamics in the <b>manifold</b> <b>pressures,</b> turbocharger, EGR, and actuators with few states {{in order to have}} short simulation times. Therefore the model has only eight states: intake and exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressures,</b> oxygen mass fraction in the intake and exhaust manifold, turbocharger speed, and three states describing the actuator dynamics. The model is more complex than e. g. the third order model in [12] that only describes the pressure and turbocharger dynamics, but it is considerably less complex than a GT-POWER model or a Ricardo WAVE model. Many models in the literature, that approximately have the same complexity as the model proposed here, use three states for each control volume in order to describe the temperature dynamics. However, the model proposed here uses only two states for each manifold. Model extensions are investigated showing that inclusion of temperature states and pressure dro...|$|R

25|$|After the Lady Be Good was identified, {{parts of}} the plane were {{returned}} to the United States for evaluation. Some parts may be seen today at the National Museum of the United States Air Force. A propeller {{can be seen in}} front of the village hall in Lake Linden, the home of Robert E. LaMotte. The U.S. Army Quartermaster Museum at Fort Lee, Virginia has a collection of personal items, such as watches, silk survival maps, and flight clothing from the crew members who were recovered. Several of these items are on display. An altimeter and <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> gauge were salvaged from the plane in 1963 by Airman Second Class Ron Pike and are on display at the March Field Air Museum just south of Riverside, CA. A Royal Air Force team visited the site in 1968 and hauled away components including an engine (later donated to the US Air Force) for evaluation by the McDonnell Douglas company. Other pieces were stripped by souvenir hunters over the years. In August 1994, the remains of the craft were recovered by a team led by Dr. Fadel Ali Mohammed and taken to a Libyan military base in Tobruk for safekeeping. They are now stored at Jamal Abdelnasser Air Force Base, Libya.|$|E
25|$|Yet the {{majority}} of World War II engines used superchargers, because they maintained three significant manufacturing advantages over turbochargers, which were larger, involved extra piping, and required exotic high-temperature materials in the turbine and pre-turbine section of the exhaust system. The size of the piping alone is a serious issue; American fighters Vought F4U and Republic P-47 used the same engine, but the huge barrel-like fuselage of the latter was, in part, needed to hold the piping {{to and from the}} turbocharger {{in the rear of the}} plane. Turbocharged piston engines are also subject to many of the same operating restrictions as gas turbine engines. Pilots must make smooth, slow throttle adjustments to avoid overshooting their target <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure.</b> The fuel/air mixture must often be adjusted far on the rich side of stoichiometric combustion needs to avoid pre-ignition or detonation in the engine when running at high power settings. In systems using a manually operated wastegate, the pilot must be careful not to exceed the turbocharger's maximum rpm. The additional systems and piping increase an aircraft engine's size, weight, complexity and cost. A turbocharged aircraft engine costs more to maintain than a comparable normally aspirated engine. The great majority of World War II American heavy bombers used by the USAAF, particularly the Wright R-1820 Cyclone-9 powered B-17 Flying Fortress, and Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp powered Consolidated B-24 Liberator four-engine bombers both used similar models of General Electric-designed turbochargers in service, as did the twin Allison V-1710-engined Lockheed P-38 Lightning American heavy fighter during the war years.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{turbocharged}} aircraft climbs, {{however, the}} pilot (or automated system) can close the wastegate, forcing more exhaust gas through the turbocharger turbine, thereby maintaining <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> during the climb, {{at least until}} the critical pressure altitude is reached (when the wastegate is fully closed), after which <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> falls. With such systems, modern high-performance piston engine aircraft can cruise at altitudes up to 25,000 feet (above which, RVSM certification would be required), where low air density results in lower drag and higher true airspeeds. This allows flying [...] "above the weather". In manually controlled wastegate systems, the pilot must take care not to overboost the engine, which causes detonation, leading to engine damage.|$|E
2500|$|A reduced {{density of}} intake air {{is caused by}} the loss of {{atmospheric}} density seen with elevated altitudes. Thus, a natural use of the turbocharger is with aircraft engines. As an aircraft climbs to higher altitudes, the pressure of the surrounding air quickly falls off.

Since atmospheric pressure reduces as the aircraft climbs, power drops as a function of altitude in normally aspirated engines.

50|$|Due to {{the cooling}} {{effect of the}} water, Otto cycle {{aircraft}} engines with water injection {{can be made to}} produce more power through higher charge densities at the time of combustion.

The [...] "boost" [...] is the pressure to which the air–fuel mixture is compressed before being fed through to the engine's cylinders (<b>manifold</b> <b>pressure).</b> Because air pressure and air density decrease with altitude, the efficiency of a piston engine drops because of the reduction in the amount of air that can be drawn into the engine; for example, the air density at [...] is ⅓ of that at sea level, thus only ⅓ of the amount of air can be drawn into the cylinder and only ⅓ of the fuel can be burnt.|$|E

Less than extensive tests were made of the 1820 -G cylinder.

The fuel consumption increased at an increasing rate as the torque was reduced; and, at 45 percent of maximum torque, the fuel consumption was 20 percent higher than at maximum torque when the engines were operating at 70 percent of rated speed. Minimum specific fuel consumption was obtained at the same air-fuel ratio regardless of compression ratio. No improvement in fuel consumption was obtained when mixtures leaner than an air-fuel ratio of 15. 5 were used.

2500|$|The newly fitted Daimler-Benz DB 605A {{engine was}} a {{development}} of the DB 601E engine utilised by the preceding Bf 109 F-4; displacement and compression ratio were increased {{as well as other}} detail improvements to ease large-scale mass production. Takeoff and emergency power of 1,475PS (1,455hp, 1,085kW) was achieved with 1.42atm (42.5 inches/6.17lbs) of boost at 2,800rpm. The DB 605 suffered from reliability problems {{during the first year of}} operation, and this output was initially banned by VT-Anw.Nr.2206, forcing Luftwaffe units to limit maximum power output to 1,310PS (1,292hp, 964kW) at 2,600rpm and 1.3atm <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> (38.9 inches/4.4lbs).
