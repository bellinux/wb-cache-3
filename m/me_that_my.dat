500|$|In May 2015, Hill {{canceled}} her scheduled concert outside Tel Aviv in Israel {{following a}} social media campaign from activists promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign. She {{said she had}} wanted to also perform a show in Ramallah in the West Bank but logistical problems had proved too great. Hill stated: [...] "It is very important to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> presence or message not be misconstrued, or a source of alienation to either my Israeli or my Palestinian fans." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead vocalist Mark Hall {{says that}} [...] "Praise You In This Storm" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's experience with a young girl, Erin Browning. The band made arrangements to meet Erin, who had performed a dance at her public school to one of the band's songs, and her family on Valentine's Day 2004 before one of their concerts. Right around the time the band connected with Erin and her family was when she was found to have cancer. Erin died on November 1, 2004. According to Hall, [...] "Watching [...] walk through this really showed me truth about my worship. Watching her walk through a real storm showed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> worship was extremely situational". Hall began writing the song before Erin's death and told her about it, but was not able to complete it before she died.|$|E

500|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1850, Fuller wrote to a friend: [...] "It has long seemed that in the year 1850 I should stand on some important plateau in the ascent of life... I feel however no marked and important change as yet." [...] Also that year, Fuller wrote: [...] "I am absurdly fearful and various omens have combined {{to give me a}} dark feeling... It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> future upon earth will soon close... I have a vague expectation of some crisis—I know not what". A few days after writing this, Fuller, Ossoli, and their child began a five-week return voyage to the United States aboard the ship Elizabeth, an American merchant freighter carrying cargo that included mostly marble from Carrara. They set sail on May 17. At sea, the ship's captain, Seth Hasty, died of smallpox. Angelino contracted the disease and recovered.|$|E
500|$|Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. Less {{than a month}} later, on 20 June 1837, William IV {{died at the age}} of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. In {{her diary}} she wrote, [...] "I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my {{dressing}} gown) and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I am Queen." [...] Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} after the forfeit, Rainmen guard Joey Haywood recounted that the team had been {{approached}} by an unknown man at their hotel following the brawl. Haywood said, [...] "He was pacing around the lobby on his phone eyeing us. He {{then went to the}} ATM but didn't actually do anything. He went and sat in a parked car out front. We thought something was going to go down, like he was scouting us out." [...] The Rainmen promptly left on the team bus, and it was considered a motive for forfeiting the game. On the morning of May 2, two days after the brawl, Rainmen guard Forrest Fisher wrote on Twitter that he had been kicked out of his apartment without warning. He said, [...] "We were in Toronto Friday morning, and I get a message from the landlord at the apartment I stay at, telling <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> bags have been packed and all of my stuff has been moved to storage." [...] The team management, who were responsible for players' living arrangements, were largely blamed for the affair. The players also claimed that they had not been paid in more than two weeks.|$|E

500|$|Lohan's next {{appearance}} was in Chapter 27 as a John Lennon fan who befriends Mark David Chapman, played by Jared Leto, {{on the day}} he murders Lennon. Filming finished in early 2006, but the film was not released until March 2008 due to difficulties in finding a distributor. In May 2007, the drama Georgia Rule was released. In the film, Lohan portrays an out-of-control teenager whose mother (Felicity Huffman) brings her to the house of her own estranged mother (Jane Fonda). Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Lohan hits a true note of spiteful princess narcissism." [...] During filming in 2006, Lohan was hospitalized, her representative saying [...] "she was overheated and dehydrated." [...] At the time Lohan was going through a breakup with Hard Rock Cafe heir Harry Morton, which contributed to her problems on the set, according to Allure. In a letter that was made public, studio executive James G. Robinson called Lohan [...] "irresponsible and unprofessional." [...] He mentioned [...] "various late arrivals and absences from the set" [...] and said that [...] "we are well aware that your ongoing all night heavy partying is the real reason for your so-called 'exhaustion.'" [...] In 2007, Lohan was cast in the film Poor Things. But in May of that year, she was arrested on a charge of driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} (DUI.) The film's producers initially voiced support, and production was put on hold, as Lohan entered the Promises Treatment Center rehabilitation facility where she stayed for 45 days. She ultimately lost the Poor Things part. In July, less than two weeks out of rehab, Lohan was arrested a second time on charges of possession of cocaine, driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license. In August, Lohan pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cocaine use and driving under the influence and was sentenced to an alcohol education program, community service, one day in jail, and was given three years probation. Lohan released a statement in which she said [...] "it is clear to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> life has become completely unmanageable because I am addicted to alcohol and drugs." [...] The same month she entered the Cirque Lodge Treatment Center in Sundance, Utah for a third stint at rehabilitation, staying for three months until her discharge in October. In November Lohan served 84 minutes in jail. A sheriff spokesman cited overcrowding and the nonviolent nature of the crime as reasons for the reduced sentence.|$|E

2500|$|Brood's outspoken {{statements}} in the press about sex and drug use brought him into the Dutch public arena even more than his music. He was romantically involved with the German singer Nina Hagen, with whom he appeared in the 1979 film Cha-Cha. He is reputed {{to be the subject}} of her song [...] "Herrmann Hiess Er" [...] (English title [...] "Herrmann Was His Name") from the 1979 Unbehagen album, a song about a drug addict. Brood relished the media attention and became the most famous hard drug user in the Netherlands. [...] "It is quite common for an artist to use drugs, but not for him to tell everybody. I admit that it scared <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> popularity could make people start using drugs," [...] he once said in an interview.|$|E

He told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> faults did not offend God." [...] Her spiritual life drew {{more and more on}} the Gospels that she carried with her at all times. The piety of her time was fed more on commentaries, but Thérèse had asked Céline to get the Gospels and the Epistles of St Paul bound into a single small volume which she could carry on her heart. She said, [...] "But it is especially the Gospels which sustain me during my hours of prayer, for in them I find what is necessary for my poor little soul.

2500|$|Like {{the other}} players in the Heartbreakers, Campbell avoids the virtuoso {{approach}} to playing, preferring to have his work {{serve the needs of}} each song. Guitar World magazine noted [...] "there are only a handful of guitarists who can claim to have never wasted a note. Mike Campbell is certainly one of them". He is a highly melodic player, often using two or three-strings-at-a-time leads instead of the more conventional one-at-a-time approach. [...] "People have told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> playing sounds like bagpipes," [...] he muses. [...] "I'm not exactly sure what that means." [...] His estimation of his own style is typically modest: [...] "I don't think people can really top Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton as far as lead guitar goes. I like my playing to bring out the songs." [...] Like Tench, he is heavily involved in constructing the arrangements for the Heartbreakers' tunes. And also like Tench, he prefers rawness to polish in the studio and onstage.|$|E
