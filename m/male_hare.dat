30|$|Studies about hare diet {{have found}} that factors which cause {{variability}} are {{the size of the}} studied area (Karmiris and Nastis 2010, Kontsiotis et al. 2011), the season (Chapuis 1990), and the vegetation of the area studied (Hulbert and Iason 1996; Kontsiotis et al. 2011). Moreover, when stomach contents are analyzed, high individual variability in the diet has been recorded (Katona et al. 2010). However, this variability has been poorly studied, even though differences in diet between sexes and ages are possible. For example, a greater propensity to disperse has been found in young <b>male</b> <b>hares</b> (Avril et al. 2011); males are more active in their movements and with larger home ranges than females (Zaccaroni et al. 2013), and microhabitat use may differ (Litvaitis 1990). The different physiological status between sexes and ages can also influence diet variability (Iason and Waterman 1988).|$|R
60|$|With mammals {{the male}} appears {{to win the}} female much more through the law of battle than through the display of his charms. The most timid animals, not {{provided}} with any special weapons for fighting, engage in desperate conflicts during the season of love. Two <b>male</b> <b>hares</b> have been seen to fight together until one was killed; male moles often fight, and sometimes with fatal results; male squirrels “engage in frequent contests, and often wound each other severely;” as do male beavers, so that “hardly a skin is without scars.”[288] I observed the same fact with the hides of the guanacoes in Patagonia; and on one occasion several were so absorbed in fighting that they fearlessly rushed close by me. Livingstone speaks of the males of the many animals in Southern Africa as almost invariably shewing the scars received in former contests.|$|R
40|$|Use {{of space}} by {{sympatric}} European hares (Lepus europaeus) and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) {{was investigated in}} a coarse-grained environment in the Mediterranean climatic zone of Australia by telemetric methods. There was {{a high degree of}} overlap between rabbits and hares during the day, when both species made use of native vegetation as cover. At night, hares travelled further than rabbits. Well after both species had become active, the hares still spent time in crop and pasture areas utilised by rabbits, although partial avoidance was detected in the periods around dawn and dusk. Rabbit home ranges were c. 10 ha, but at 149 ha mean hare home range area matched the maximum predicted for a herbivorous species of its size. Home ranges of rabbits, and overlap between male rabbits, decreased as succulent green feed became available. Home ranges of hares remained large, and overlap between <b>male</b> <b>hares</b> remained high, irrespective of the availability of green feed. [URL]...|$|R

Cortisol was used in an-imals to measure stress levels. Aims of the study were toascertain if a difference in hair cortisol concentration (HCC) existed between hares raised according to different breedingtechnologies (familiar, semi-industrial, industrial breeding) before transportation and after a pre-acclimatization period,and if a short period of adaptation could reduce the stressstatus. Hair samples were collected from 120 hares from anarea of approximately 13. 5 sp cm from the leftsulcusjugularisby using an electric hair clipper, at day 0 (d 0) andafter 15 days (d 15), and processed by previously establishedprocedures. HCC significantly decreased at d 15 compared tod 0 in all groups. A significant difference in HCC was detectedbetween female hares of the three groups at d 0, between maleand female animals belonging to the industrial group at d 15,between d 0 and d 15 in female hares belonging to the familiar and to the industrial group, and between d 0 and d 15 in <b>male</b> <b>hares</b> belonging to all groups.

40|$|A two - year {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to deter 111 ine the tick fauna of insular Newfoundland and explore their potential as vectors of pathogens to both humans and animals. During 2002 and 2003 seven species of ixodid ticks {{were collected from}} nine hosts (snowshoe hare, Lincoln's sparrow, domestic cat, domestic dog, domestic rabbit, Atlantic puffin, common murre, red fox and human) on the island portion of the province: Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, Jxodes uriae, I muris, I scapularis, 1 ricinus, Dermacentor variabilis and Rhipicephalus sanguineus. The most common species was H leporispalustris with July, August and September being the peak period of activity. Although higher numbers of H leporispalustris were collected from <b>male</b> <b>hares</b> than female hares, {{the difference between the}} number of ticks of each life stage found on each sex was not statistically significant, except for male ticks in 2002. All life stages of H leporispalustris were capable of surviving temperatures as low as 0 °C but none lower than - 5 °C. Another species that showed a seasonal distribution for the females was 1 scapularis. This tick had a bimodal temporal distribution with no ticks recorded during August and September. Four pathogens were tested for: Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Francisella tularensis and vector - borne viruses, but only B. burgdorferi was detected in 16...|$|R

40|$|Three {{different}} dietary {{doses of}} Lippia citriodora natural extract {{were tested in}} order to verify their effect on productive performance and the meat quality of intensively-reared hare (Lepus europaeus Pall.). The 240 day-trial was conducted on 20 <b>male</b> <b>hares,</b> divided into 4 homogeneous groups of 5 animals each. A control group received a basal diet without any supplementation, {{and the other three}} experimental groups received a natural extract of Lippia citriodora, titrated in verbascoside, in the following amounts: 1 g, 1. 5 g and 2 g of natural extract/kg feed in the low (LNE), medium (MNE), and high natural extract (HNE) groups, respectively. Natural extract enhanced the quality of the meat: there was a significant decrease (P< 0. 05) in saturated fatty acids and a significant increase (P< 0. 05) in mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids. The oxidative stability of the meat improved, thus highlighting a possible link between the decrease (P< 0. 05) in TBARS values and an increase (P< 0. 05) in lipid vitamin content. The cholesterol content of the meat decreased markedly (P< 0. 01) after the dietary verbascoside treatment, thus improving the health benefits of the meat. These results clearly show the important role of Lippia citriodora extract, titrated in verbascoside, in improving the quality of the meat of intensively-reared hares. In addition the present paper underlines how the use of natural antioxidant in the animal feeding system may provide healthier and low-oxidized products to the final consumer...|$|R

40|$|Since the mid-seventies, {{a continual}} {{reduction}} of the European brown hare population has been observed in Poland and other European countries. Probably many intercorrelating factors {{play a role in}} this continous reduction. On the one hand, one has to take into consideration the anthropogenetic influences such as intensive agricultural cultivation, environmental pollution, loss of habitat, increased road traffic and hunting as probable reasons for the decrease in population. On the other hand, predators, climatic influences, cyclic fluctuations in population as well as diseases, in particular pseudotuberculosis, pasteurellosis, coccidiosis and European brown hare syndrome, are being discussed as negative influences on the evolution of the hare population. In cooperation with Prof. Z. Pielowski (Czempin Poland) 125 brown hares were shot in Czempin in 1993 / 94. Pathoanatomical, histopathological, virological, bacteriological, parasitological, reproductionbiological, electronmicroscopical and toxicological investigations were conducted to determine the significance of infectious diseases, parasites and harmful substances as factors of influence {{on the development of the}} brown hare population in Czempin. The present study could not ascertain a single cause for the decline of the population. Rather it showed that the decline must be attributed to multifactoral occurrences. The investigations showed that the most significant probable cause for the decrease on the one hand is the European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) : using an ELISA testkit six (7, 6 %) samples were antigen-positive for EBHS virus (EBHSV). In one of these samples caliciviruses could be observed by negative staining electron microscopy. EBHSV antibodies were present in 38 (38 %) of the hares. Pathohistological investigations yielded the following results: in 50 % of the EBHSV antigen-positive and in 29 % of the seropositive hares predominantly periportal hepatitis in the form of small scattered foci of mononuclear cells was found. These results indicate that in all probability EBHS in brown hares in Czempin had a subacute or chronic course of the infection. On the other hand the comparative high level of contamination with cadmium could be equally important to the dynamics of the hare population. In each of the 48 investigated kidneys cadmium was found in concentrations of up to 17, 3 mg/kg FS (fresh substance). Brown hares with a cadmium contamination above average (4, 4 to 17, 3 mg/kg FS) showed a significantly higher incidence of tubulonephrosis than animals with a residue content of cadmium below 4, 4 mg/kg FS. Although these alterations in the kidneys could have resulted from other causes, these findings suggest that chronic damage of the kidneys could have resulted from the cadmium residue content. Further possible factors influencing the development of the hare population were found in the analysis and search for residue contents of organochlorine compounds in 49 liver samples. In some of the cases it appeared that the detected maximum levels of endrin (0, 13 mg/kg FS (fatty substance)), dieldrin (0, 19 mg/kg FS) and heptachlor-epoxid (0, 61 mg/kg FS) could have impaired the health of the affected individuals. It may be critical that some animals were simultaneously high contaminated with HCH, PCBs, heptachlor-epoxid and partly with cadmium, dieldrin and endrin. However the histopathological examination did not reveal any findings wich could definitely be brought into connection with a poisoning by organochlorine compounds. Furthermore, the comparatively high incidence of histological alterations found in the hares (especially interstitial pneumonia, haemosiderosis of spleen and liver, lymphoplasmocytic enteritis and interstitial nephritis) point to a reduced state of health. The present study was not able to substantiate the cause for the alterations observed. In addition, a reduced reproductive capacity in the <b>male</b> <b>hares</b> could be a further reason for the decline of the population. In 35 <b>male</b> <b>hares</b> the motility of epididymal sperms during breeding season (January to September) was investigated. The motility varied between 0 % and 90 %. However, in one-third of the hares the observed motility was below 10 %, wich points to hypokinospermie. The results of the bacteriological and parasitological examinations lead to the interpretation that the typical harediseases (pseudotuberculosis, pasteurellosis, coccidiosis) as well as the contamination with lead and mercury and most of the organochlorine compounds (for example DDT) play a subordinate or insignificant role in the decrease of the harepopulation in Czempin...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pastoral)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. This {{research}} {{attempts to}} determine how gifts of individual believers can enrich the respective gender roles in church and society. Some Pauline writings were studied, {{and in addition to}} Romans 123 - 8, exegesis is also done on other passages (1 Corinthians 121 - 31 and Ephesians 4 : 4 - 16) dealing with the 'body of Christ" (gifts). An exegesis on passages concerning the role of women (gender) (1 Corinthians 11 : 3 - 16, Ephesians 521 - 33, 1 Corinthians 14 : 33 b- 35, I Timothy 28 - 15 and Romans 1631 - 16) in church and marriage follows. By doing this, biblical guidelines are found on how men and women should exercise their gifts in the church. Galatians 328 is found to form the basis for all Pauline writings. Here Paul puts the given fact that "in Christ Jesus" <b>male</b> and female <b>'are</b> one" and therefore equal before God. There still remains a created difference between male and female. Turning to gifts, men and women have equal access to all gifts, but {{the way in which they}} exercise the gifts may have certain nuances. This research attempts to correct the old practice by using Zerfass's method of putting the basis theoretical perspectives into interaction with meta-theoretical perspectives, so that a new practice is developed. This means that a study of other relevant sciences (i. e. Psychology, Sociology, Law, Feminism I Feminist Theology) concerning gifts and gender had to be done. Supplementing this with an empirical study, it is determined how gifts are used among the genders in daily practice. In this way the real experiences of men and women in church are reflected. The research comes to a close when pastoral consequences are drawn, and a strategy for churches is proposed. The finding is that both men and women should take part in the offices of the church, because they are on an equal footing with one another. Doctora...|$|R
