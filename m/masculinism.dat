50|$|Davey’s {{emerging}} {{tendency to}} modify or enlarge his poetics {{with each new}} book or cluster of books became more apparent in his first four poetry books of the 1970s and their differing approaches to a phenomenological prosody. Weeds (1970) is a sequence of one-paragraph prose poems with frequent disjunctions between the sentences. The Clallam (1973) is a narrative of a 1907 British Columbia shipwreck constructed in brief exclamatory sections that recall the abrasive mock narratives of Jack Spicer. King of Swords (1972) retells much of the Arthurian story in contemporary diction to suggest the continuing persistence of that story’s self-destructive <b>masculinism.</b> Arcana (1973) uses longer lines, postmodern indeterminacy and the imagery of the Rider-Waite Tarot deck in purportedly unfinished 'manuscript poems,' each dated and printed within quotation marks. All these books were outside, or alongside, usual Canadian poetry practices. The most visible Black Mountain influence in the latter two books was the medievalism of Robert Duncan, but much differently framed.|$|E

Two arguments are made. First, there will be a coherence between discourse and the program agendas offered at domestic violence shelters, a coherence between discourse or program agenda and organizational variables, and a coherence between discourse or program agenda and funding sources. The most robust empirical finding supported the coherence between a social service discourse and a program agenda based on the logic statements associated with <b>masculinism,</b> liberal individualism and medicalization. The second argument posits functional relationships among discourse, program agenda, the organizational variables and the funding variables. Social service programs were predicted by social service discourse and by federal monies and feminist programs were predicted by the number of women sheltered; social service discourse was predicted by social service programs and feminist discourse was predicted by the number of women sheltered. These findings suggest that some program agendas put in place by domestic violence shelters may actually contribute to <b>masculinism</b> as a cultural practice...|$|E

However, geographic literature on urban exploration has largely ignored the particular {{qualities of the}} urban explorer as a subject and neglected feminist scholarship on embodiment and social difference.

40|$|This is a revisionist {{study of}} Syrian nationalism. At {{the heart of}} this {{intellectual}} enterprise is an examination of the inherent and ingrained masculinist bias. While teasing out this aspect, I enquire about the basis of this prejudice. The masculinist interpretation of nationalism and its dissemination across Syrian society is, I argue, a result of the ideological foundations that took place over half a century (from 1920 to 1970). I seek to explore the status of women through investigating the nexus between the constructions of masculinity and nationalism, grounded in the imaginative anticipation of the nation within its nationalist narrative. The research paradigm underlying this study includes elements from perspectives of historical and comparative approaches, and critique of ideology. By philosophically engaging with the works of three key Baˈathist ideologues, I demonstrate the nature and character of that skewed nationalism. Consequently, this thesis documents the systematic masculinisation of conceptions of nationhood by Syria’s three founding fathers: Sāṭiʿ al-Ḥuṣrī (1879 – 1968), Michel ʿAflaq (1910 – 89) and Zakī al-Arsūzī (1899 – 1968), 1 and how their ideologies impacted later national narratives in the political and cultural contexts. In critically analysing the philosophical origin of Syrian nationalism in the writings of these three Syrian thinkers, the thesis investigates how <b>masculinism</b> is constructed in its narrative, reinforcing boundaries that question national belonging and identity. The thesis uses the phases of Syrian cultural and political nationalism to see how <b>masculinism</b> was further constructed in the early state formation in both the constitutional and legal narratives. It also investigates how the perpetuation of a masculinist ethos, which defines national identity and belonging, was further reflected in the state-consolidation stage through conceptualising nationalist songs as political symbols that designate politics of gender exclusion and inclusion. In so doing, it highlights the role of early Baˈathist theoreticians in perpetuating an ideology based on idealising manhood, hegemony and hierarchy as the basis of national identity. This dominance of masculinised national belonging and membership is intimately linked with the normalisation of militarism that configures men as patriarchal figures and political leaders of both the family and state. More importantly, investigating the process of nation formation in its three stages (theoretical, political and cultural) intersects with the missing representation of women, and this thesis highlights the overlap between this process and the rite of passage to manhood, as the realisation of national consciousness becomes juxtaposed with men’s heroic achievements. Thus, this thesis is about investigating the construction and perpetuation of <b>masculinism</b> in Syrian nationalism...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} the social and environmental problems we face are primarily the result of patriarchal or ‘malestream’ norms. These norms are constructed on hypermasculinist ways of being, thinking and doing that inhibit the growth and development of sustainable principles and practices. Responding to this assertion and {{following in the footsteps}} of deep ecology, social ecology and ecological feminism, the study brings masculinities concerns to the heart of the human/Nature relationship while also bringing concerns for society and the environment to the ways we think about men in the modern West. Further, it argues that if we are to achieve a truly sustainable future, then we must encourage men to reawaken their innate care. The dissertation declares that all men are born good and possess an infinite capacity to care and be caring. It is however recognised that these innate capacities for men to care and be caring are suppressed by ‘men’s oppression’ and that this oppression can prevent men from expressing their fullest humanness to the detriment of all Others and themselves. The dissertation recommends that men develop emotional competencies along with their intellect and intuition in order to authentically nurture the relational space between Others and themselves. Building on feminist care theory, a theoretical framework termed ecological <b>masculinism</b> is introduced, which facilitates modern Western men to care for and be caring towards society, Nature and the self—concurrently. The dissertation constructs a theoretical framework for ecological <b>masculinism</b> that is accompanied by a plurality of ecomasculine praxes. This ecologised masculinities theory and praxes instigates a new conversation in environmental philosophy that facilitates the rise of ‘ecomen’ who serve important roles in forging a deep green future for all of life on Earth...|$|E

This article aims to overcome this dualism by developing a relational, strategic, and discursive understanding of masculinities and focusing on the gendering strategies that create them. These strategies are identified as masculinization of the market and feminization of the state, feminization and racialization of (some) security work, hypermasculinization as a critical or affirmative discourse, romanticizing the autonomous male bond, and militarization of private security. It is argued that private security as well as critical discourses on it integrate business, humanitarian, and militarized masculinities in a way that ultimately legitimizes <b>masculinism</b> an...|$|E

The settings of adventure stories arc cultural spaces in which hegemonic masculinity is mapped and, in some cases, unmapped...|$|E

Accompanying {{this has been a}} proliferation of films, including full-length feature films, which address the topic and have done much to influence public perception of the issue. This paper analyses two of these films which were made for the mainstream US market: Trade and Taken. Both films present a conservative and heteronormative perspective revolving around middle-aged North American law enforcement officers rescuing innocent young girls. Hence, these films participate in the general securitisation of trafficking discourse in which the US has been a leader. In spite of their ostensible concern about the exploitation of women, these films present trafficking mostly as an occasion for the redemption and rehabilitation of the beleaguered white American male, appropriating the problem of trafficking in the service of a US-led neo-imperialism bolstered by <b>masculinism</b> and xenophobia, and implicitly problematising women's independence and justifying the control of their movements and sexuality.

40|$|The underrepresentation and {{misrepresentation}} {{of women}} in United States politics are conditions that have existed for centuries. Women have been underrepresented because of the perceptions <b>masculinism</b> and gender hierarchy have created. These ideologies privilege men and masculine qualities, which puts women at a disadvantage. Research has shown that women are just as successful as men when running for office. Women, however, remain underrepresented primarily because they choose not to run. A few reasons why women choose not to run are that their roles as wives and mothers may interfere with their candidacies {{and they tend to}} have less money, fewer political contacts, and less appropriate employment histories. Aside from women choosing not to run, there are some other reasons why women are underrepresented in United States politics and these are referred to as barriers that need to be overcome. Some of these barriers are social and gendered stereotypes, incumbency, sex discrimination and the political system itself. These barriers pose a problem because they deter women from running for office and they keep the women who run from succeeding.

40|$|This article takes {{cue from}} Sarojini Nadar’s article {{analysing}} the Mighty Men Conference (MMC) in South Africa {{as a case}} study of <b>masculinism,</b> where the author makes some passing comparison between Promise Keepers in America (PKA) and the MMC in South Africa. This article investigates the specific ways in which PKA and MMC are ideologically similar, while also evaluating how their differences accrue dissimilar results with respect to their missions on race reconciliation. The article argues that despite their shared religious similarities as evangelical Christian men’s organisations and perceptions regarding the ‘crisis in/of masculinity’, race discourse plays different roles in the ministries of PKA and MMC. The key observation arising from addressing this discourse is that in the context of PKA, the organisation’s institutional focus on race translates itself into discussions and debates about race reconciliation amongst the various racialised men of the movement as part of the organisation’s work of self-transformation. However, such talk, although present at the individual level to some extent in the MMC, is absent at the institutional level. The absence of such discourse is especially problematic given the visibility of race in public discourse in South Africa, in general, and also points to a masked refusal to give up white male privilege in the post-apartheid public sphere...|$|E
40|$|In {{this chapter}} I will explore the {{implications}} of the definitively Australian style of masculine behaviour called 2 ̆ 7 mateship 2 ̆ 7 for gender relations in Australia. Mateship is part of the Australian male heritage; it originated in colonial days and was glorified in war and sport. The feminist movement in Australia has challenged the dominant form of masculinity inherent in mateship and the basic rationale for gender relations that flow from it. In this context, I will discuss Australian profeminist men 2 ̆ 7 s attempts to challenge patriarchal gender relations and construct non-patriarchal subjectivities and practices. Theorizing about masculinity in Australia has tended to be derivative of overseas literature. This is partly because publishers are looking for overseas markets for their books so they discourage writers on masculinity from grounding men 2 ̆ 7 s practices in a specifically Australian context. While there are benefits in generalizing about western masculinities, such writing misses the uniqueness of the lived experiences of Australian men. It is this uniqueness that I will address in this chapter. As McGrane and Patience (1995 : 15) note, 2 ̆ 7 Australian <b>masculinism</b> has a history of its own that needs to be recognized {{at the same time as}} it can be usefully compared to the masculinisms of similar cultures 2 ̆ 7. <br /...|$|E

The latter is especially strange since Sartre used strongly sexist metaphors and adopted a macho attitude towards women. In her book Hipparchia's Choice, Le Dœuff speaks in this context of "theoretical <b>masculinism.</b> " She convincingly shows in this book that Sartre without using images could not have closed his existentialist philosophy: without the feminine drawback he {{would not have been able}} to explain why man cannot become god. Sartre not only understands gaining knowledge as a rape of a woman he also fears that the possessed feminine (body) could reverse its position from being dominated to the dominating force by appropriating the masculine through slime. In Being and Nothingness Sartre states that "slime is the revenge of the In-itself. A sickly–sweet, feminine revenge.

Sunstein, perhaps unconsciously, recognizes the disruptive power of Catharine MacKinnon 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of pornography, which not only expressly questions male dominance and heterosexuality but also, implicitly, challenges mainstream Constitutional legal scholarship and the academic status quo.

40|$|Gender {{representation}} is a frequently addressed field within media and communication studies {{in general and}} in the subject of TV advertising in particular. Previous research mainly focused on the detection of commonly exploited stereotypes {{that are used to}} portray women and men respectively. Much emphasize has been placed on the relationship between the sexes regarding social roles and professions, embedded in a cultural and ideological context. The purpose of this scientific work however is to examine how the construction of gender stereotypes in media takes place, which practices are used to connote meaning. Using a qualitative method, namely a visual discourse analysis, the aim of the study is to unveil subtle but also obvious symbols and characteristics that are used to represent feminine and masculine traits respectively in order to expand the current body of research. This proceeding marks an approach to have {{a closer look at the}} social interaction of females and males in TV advertisements in order to get an insight in the allocation of power and subsequently, social roles. Four TV advertisements are used as objects of investigation. As a theoretical fundament, the gender theories of sexism, <b>masculinism</b> and feminism are introduced. The findings suggest that the representation of women and men still follows strong patterns of stereotyping, not just on the level of role allocation but also on a behavioral level. However, the study comes to the conclusion that an asymmetric treatment of the sexes is not necessarily the result of gender stereotyping; in the case, both sexes are stereotyped similarly, not depicting either men or women dominating their counterparts in a global context. ...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{critically}} {{responds to}} Judith Halberstam’s concern that studies of masculinities {{are confined to}} boys and boyhood and Angela McRobbie’s despair that the “phallic girl” with her licensed mimicry of <b>masculinism</b> disavows any resistance to regulatory gender/sexual regimes. Inspired by Judith Butler’s notion of performativity and her desire to trouble and undo gender/sex/sexuality binarisms, this chapter queers the field of masculinity/boyhood studies and addresses postfeminist concerns {{about the lack of}} a politics of resistance by foregrounding the seduction of contemporary tomboyism for young tweenage girls in their negotiation of an increasingly (hetero) sexualized girlhood (Mitchell & Reid-Walsh, Seven going on seventeen: Tween studies in the culture of girlhood. New York: Peter Lang, 2005). A central aim of the chapter is to problematize the binary logic of sexual difference that has informed past and current, even queer theorizations of tomboyism by queer(y) ing the ways in which girls’ ditching of or deviation from normative femininity is often theorized as performing masculinity. We argue, following Butler, that interpreting tomboyism as mimesis in this way misses how girls can manipulate norms, exceed them, and rework them and thus “expose the realities to which we thought we were confined as open to transformation” (Butler, Undoing gender. London: Routledge, 2004, p. 217). The chapter concludes by asking what would it mean (theoretically, methodologically, and empirically) to create gender taxonomies that are flexible enough to recognize a more capacious femininity that can embrace subversion and resistance without ejecting such queer performances into the realm of masculinity and thus reproducing dominant discourses of masculinity as “power” and femininity as “lack. ...|$|E

While they’re sometimes presented within a binary scheme opposing <b>masculinism</b> and profeminism, the intervention intends to provide another typology that goes beyond this ideological, non heuristic vision {{in order to identify}} transversalities and the obvious or subtle mechanisms of gender relations and what French speakers call “rapports sociaux de sexe” (Trans. “gendered social relations”). ”Since women can’t achieve equality, the end of male domination and the disappearance of gender without men, and since many of them want {{to put an end to}} soliloquies, this intervention aims at historicizing the critical studies on men, and contextualizing their analytical paradigms. In short, I intend to grasp both convergences and divergences in these analytical frameworks, and to deconstruct the masculine just as feminist women have been doing with "the eternal feminine. "For a long time, while deconstructing the forms of domination that women suffered, gender sociologists, especially feminist sociologists, have been struggling against the androcentrism in social sciences. This androcentrism (what might be called the 1 st degree of androcentrism) made us think of the male as being normal, general, and the female as being particular, specific. Delphy (1998), Devreux (1985), and Guillaumin (1992) have amply demonstrated in their works the epistemological biases of our different disciplines, and their effects. There have not always been two sexes in sociology. Instead, we dealt with, on the one hand, a general being bearing the characteristics of humanity, actually the representative of that humanity, coinciding with male gender, and on the other hand, a specific gendered being, the woman.

40|$|ABSTRACT For {{most of the}} 20 th century {{literature}} and criticism of literature functioned as central engines of cultural change across the western world. This was especially the case in ex-colonial societies like New Zealand where writers and intellectuals frequently {{expressed a desire to}} create sophisticated local cultures which could compete with the foundation societies in Europe. Between 1940 and 1984 New Zealand writers and intellectuals developed a mode of literary criticism which this essay refers to as ‘Literary Critique ’ for this very reason. In the absence of well established cultural traditions and a sense that they had a duty to import and indigenise western intellectual thought in order to further the evolution of New Zealand culture, a series of writers wrote often scathing critiques of their culture, using literature as their point of entry. Post-War New Zealand Literary Critique stands as evidence of a provincial, mascu-line, and angry intellectual culture. KEYWORDS critique • culture • literature • <b>masculinism</b> • modernism • New Zealand • post-modern In The Bookmen’s Dominion, Chris Hilliard points out that ‘[t]he history of creative and intellectual activity is not just the history of great minds’ (Hilliard, 2006 : 120). Social and cultural infrastructures such as writers ’ societies and libraries play a fundamental {{role in the development of}} a literary and intellectual culture, without which ‘great minds ’ could not find an outlet for their writing. His comment is an implicit warning against cultural nationalist claims for intellectual exceptionalism. But New Zealand has never been in danger of claiming intellectual exceptionalism; indeed, New Zealand culture has long been noted for a strong strain of anti-intellectualism and denigration of local intellectual activity. Within this context it is important that we try to identify people who made concerted efforts to bring new ideas into the country and to create a robust intellectual tradition. Their writing represent...|$|E
