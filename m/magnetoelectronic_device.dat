In addition, HHE devices are extremely well-suited to implementing threshold logic circuits, which allows many complex logic functions to be implemented in fewer gates than are required in systems based on AND-OR logic. We present the design of an HHE-based reconfigurable macrocell based on two-level threshold logic that can be configured on a cycle-by-cycle basis while internally storing non-volatile configuration data and computation state. The performance of this macrocell is characterized, and compared to that of competing technologies, showing that it has a significantly better power-delay product when implementing complex functions of many inputs...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The carbon {{nanotube}} is a promising candidate {{as a component}} in nanoscale molecular electronic devices [1 [...] 9].

In addition, metallic nanotubes show extremely high conductivity, and a long mean-free path. Ballistic transport has been observed in nanotubes even at room temperature [4].

40|$|The spin-valve {{transistor}} is a <b>magnetoelectronic</b> <b>device</b> {{that can}} be used as a magnetic field sensor. It has a ferromagnet-semiconductor hybrid structure. Using a vacuum metal bonding technique, the spin-valve transistor structure Si/Pt/NiFe/Au/Co/Au/Si is obtained. It employs hot electron transport across the spin valve (NiFe/Au/Co). The hot electrons are injected into the spin valve across the Si/Pt Schottky diode. After traversing across the spin valve these hot electrons are collected across the Au-Si Schottky diode with energy and momentum selection. The output current is found to be extremely sensitive to the spin-dependent scattering of hot electrons in the spin valve. This gives a magnetocurrent above 200 % in a few oersted of magnetic field at room temperature. The different physical effects which govern the output current of the device are examined by studying different types of spin-valve transistors that have Si/Au, Si/Pt and Si/Co collector Schottky diodes and Si(100) and Si(111) orientations. It has been observed that along with the Schottky diodes the vacuum metal bonding also plays an important role in determining the output current. In addition, it is realized that collector diodes with extremely low leakage currents, are essential in order to observe huge magnetotransport properties at room temperature...|$|E

40|$|Memory and latch {{circuits}} in CMOS systems rely on capacitatively-stored {{charge to}} hold state information. When power {{is removed from}} a chip, this charge quickly drains off, destroying any information that was contained in the chip.

The magnetization direction and coercivity of each individual layer are determined by the deposition process in oblique incidence geometry and can be completely decoupled from neighboring layers. This applies for layers of any ferromagnetic material down to layer thicknesses of a few nm and lateral dimensions of a few 100 nm, enabling the design of efficient and compact <b>magnetoelectronic</b> <b>devices,</b> encompassing precision magnetoresistive sensors as well as layer systems with multiple addressable remanent states for magnetic memory applications...|$|R
