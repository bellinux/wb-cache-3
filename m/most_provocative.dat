5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the <b>most</b> <b>provocative</b> ones.|$|E

In his opinion, Bulgaria doesn't even {{make it to the}} top three of the <b>most</b> <b>provocative</b> countries caricatured by Entropa. The <b>most</b> <b>provocative</b> country is Poland, with the reference to gays. It is followed by the UK (missing) and Slovakia that, according to Mr Černý, is a bubble restricted by Hungary.|$|E

25|$|The {{industrialization}} of the Korean Peninsula {{began with}} the Joseon dynasty (in particular with King, and later Emperor, Gojong) while Korea was still independent but accelerated under Japanese occupation. It {{continues to be the}} subject of controversy between the two Koreas and Japan. The manner of the acceleration of industrialization under Japanese occupation, especially the utilization of industrialization only for the purposes of benefiting Japan, the exploitation of the Korean people in their own country, the marginalization of Korean history and culture, the environmental exploitation of the Korean Peninsula, and its long-term negative repercussions for modern-day North and South Korea are among the <b>most</b> <b>provocative</b> aspects of the controversy.|$|E
25|$|Patrick Henry {{was sworn}} into a sleepy {{session of the}} {{legislature}} on May 20; many of the members had left town. On about May 28, a ship arrived with an urgent letter from Montague: the Stamp Act had passed. On May 29, Henry introduced the Virginia Stamp Act Resolves. The first two resolutions affirmed that the colonists had the same rights and privileges as Britons; the next two stated that taxation should be exacted only by one's representatives. The fifth was the <b>most</b> <b>provocative,</b> as it named the Virginia legislature, the General Assembly, as the representatives of Virginia empowered to tax. Two other resolutions were offered, though their authorship is uncertain. Edmund and Helen Morgan, in their account of the Stamp Act crisis, suggested that Henry acted as he saw the Stamp Act as both a threat to Virginians' rights, {{and an opportunity to}} advance himself politically.|$|E

500|$|Other critics concurred {{that the}} film had artistic merit. [...] "atching Moore's noir tale is like being super-glued to your seat while getting poked in the eye," [...] Chalat-Noaker wrote. [...] "It's both {{fascinating}} and repelling." [...] Stephen Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "one of the strangest and <b>most</b> <b>provocative</b> movies this reporter has seen in eight years attending the Sundance Film Festival". At Indiewire, Eric Kohn wrote that [...] "Moore portrays Disney World as the ultimate horror show [...] and gets the point across in nearly every scene".|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan, {{who felt}} {{the special effects}} were unusual, stated that Spielberg may {{actually}} have done his job in War of the Worlds [...] "better than he realizes", showing how fragile the world is. Turan claimed Spielberg raised a <b>most</b> <b>provocative</b> question: [...] "Is the ultimate fantasy an invasion from outer space, {{or is it the}} survival of the human race?" [...] However, Broomfield Enterprises Dan Marcucci and Nancy Serougi did not share Berardinelli and Turan's opinion. They felt that Morgan Freeman's narration was unnecessary, and that the first half was [...] "great" [...] but the second half [...] "became filled with clichés, riddled with holes, and tainted by Tim Robbins".|$|E
500|$|Modelling atomic {{behaviour}} under incident {{electromagnetic radiation}} using [...] "virtual oscillators" [...] at the absorption and emission frequencies, {{rather than the}} (different) apparent frequencies of the Bohr orbits, led Max Born, Werner Heisenberg and Kramers to explore different mathematical models. They {{led to the development}} of matrix mechanics, the first form of modern quantum mechanics. The BKS theory also generated discussion of, and renewed attention to, difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory. The <b>most</b> <b>provocative</b> element of BKS – that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction, but only statistically – was soon shown to be in conflict with experiments conducted by Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger. In light of these results, Bohr informed Darwin that [...] "there is nothing else to do than to give our revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible".|$|E
25|$|One of Dickinson's {{best known}} and <b>most</b> sexually <b>provocative</b> movie roles followed, {{that of the}} tawdry widow Wilma McClatchie from the Great Depression romp Big Bad Mama (1974) with William Shatner and Tom Skerritt. Although well into her forties at the time, she {{appeared}} nude in several scenes, which created interest in the movie and {{a new generation of}} male fans for Dickinson.|$|R
40|$|Friedrich Kittler {{was one of}} the world’s <b>most</b> influential, <b>provocative</b> and {{misunderstood}} media theorists. His work spans {{analyses of}} historical ‘discourse networks’ inspired by French poststructuralism, influential theorisations of new media, through to musings on music and mathematics. Niall Flynn notes how Kittler himself defied familiar understandings of interdisciplinary research and challenges established research models. The best essays in this volume, Flynn argues, practice the same expanded form of humanities research...|$|R
5000|$|The conference agenda {{addressed}} {{the specifics of}} tactical procedure, allocation of resources and the broader issues of diplomatic policy. The debate and negotiations produced what {{was known as the}} [...] "Casablanca Declaration", and what is, perhaps, its <b>most</b> historically <b>provocative</b> statement of purpose, [...] "unconditional surrender".

500|$|The social {{environment}} {{created by the}} publicity of the Payne Fund Studies and religious protests reached such a fever pitch that {{a member of the}} Hays Office described it as a [...] "state of war". However, newspapers including The Plain Dealer (Cleveland), New Orleans Times Picayune, Chicago Daily News, Atlanta Journal, Saint Paul Dispatch, the Philadelphia Record and Public Ledger, the Boston American and New York's Daily News, Daily Mirror, and Evening Post all lambasted the studies. When discussing the Supreme Court's 1915 decision, film historian Gregory Black argues that the efforts of reformers might have been lessened had [...] "filmmakers been willing to produce films for specialized audiences (adults only, family, no children) … but the movers and shakers of the industry wanted or needed the largest possible market." [...] The <b>most</b> <b>provocative</b> pictures were the most profitable, with the 25% of the motion picture industry's output that was the most sensational supporting the cleaner 75%.|$|E

James Skinner of BBC Music wrote that Loud lacked the [...] "chart-friendly moments" [...] of Rated R and criticized the overtly sexual lyrics which he found [...] "at odds with" [...] the flirtatious appeal for which Rihanna was aiming.

500|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{received}} two reviews in the Journal of Homosexuality, one by David A. Begelman, {{and the other}} by Fritz A. Fluckiger. Begelman gave the book a mixed assessment, calling Tripp a skillful writer who was learned {{on the subject of}} homosexuality, but whose objectivity was nevertheless open to question. Fluckiger gave the book a positive review, calling it [...] "easily the <b>most</b> <b>provocative</b> work on sexuality to have appeared in a long time" [...] and credited Tripp with offering a powerful challenge to established views about homosexuality and showing command of a range of data from many fields. Fluckiger maintained that Tripp offered the most novel account {{of the way in which}} behavioral expression communicates internal states since Charles Darwin's The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), but considered his most original contribution to be his explanation of how erotic feeling depends on [...] "resistance", which might consist of any of several impediments to easy access to sexual satisfaction.|$|E

500|$|Cartoonist Will Eisner (1917–2005) {{first came}} upon the work of Lynd Ward in 1938. [...] Eisner was an early pioneer in the American comic book {{industry}} and saw in Ward's work a greater potential for comics. [...] Eisner's ambitions were rebuffed by his peers, who saw comics as no more than low-status entertainment. [...] Eisner withdrew from the commercial comics industry in the early 1950s to do government and educational work. [...] He returned in the 1970s when the atmosphere had changed and his readers and peers seemed more receptive to his ambitions. [...] In 1978, he began a career of creating book-length comics, {{the first of which}} was A Contract with God; the book was marketed as a [...] "graphic novel", a term that became standard {{towards the end of the}} 20th century. [...] Eisner called Ward [...] "perhaps the <b>most</b> <b>provocative</b> graphic storyteller" [...] of the 20th century. [...] He wrote that Ward's Vertigo (1937) required considerable investment from readers in order to fill in the story between images.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Andy Kellman of Allmusic praised {{the song and}} its memorability, writing Cockiness (Love It),' [...] {{one of the most}} hypnotic and wicked beats of the last decade". Priya Elan of NME described the lyrics [...] "Suck my cockiness, [...] my persuasion" [...] as [...] "cringey", but complimented the song's compositional structure, writing that it provides a [...] "genuine elastic thrill, twisting into all sorts of jaw-dropping musical shapes". Randell Roberts of the Los Angeles Times described [...] "Cockiness (Love It)" [...] and another track from the album, [...] "Birthday Cake", as the [...] "breast and booty" [...] of Talk That Talk but noted that they failed to capture the raunchiness that they set out to achieve. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly also wrote that [...] "Cockiness (Love It)" [...] and [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] were the <b>most</b> <b>provocative</b> songs on the album, describing them as [...] "I-like-it-rough tracks", but criticized them for being album fillers designed to get the listener out of the bedroom and on to the dance floor.|$|E
500|$|Fabric {{shortage}} {{continued for}} some time {{after the end of}} the war. Two-piece swimsuits without the usual skirt panel and other excess material started appearing in the US when the government ordered a 10% reduction in fabric used in woman's swimwear in 1943 as wartime rationing. By that time, two-piece swimsuits were frequent on American beaches. The July 9, 1945, Life shows women in Paris wearing similar items. Hollywood stars like Ava Gardner, Rita Hayworth and Lana Turner tried similar swimwear or beachwear. Pin ups of Hayworth and Esther Williams in the costume were widely distributed. The <b>most</b> <b>provocative</b> swimsuit was the 1946 Moonlight Buoy, a bottom and a top of material that weighed only eight ounces. What made the Moonlight Buoy distinctive was a large cork buckle attached to the bottoms, which made it possible to tie the top to the cork buckle and splash around au naturel while keeping both parts of the suit afloat. Life magazine had a photo essay on the Moonlight Buoy and wrote, [...] "The name of the suit, of course, suggests the nocturnal conditions under which nude swimming is most agreeable." ...|$|E

5000|$|Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, {{particularly}} book V.v, {{has been}} called the <b>most</b> economically <b>provocative</b> analytic writing in ancient Greece. [...] Therein, Aristotle discusses justice in distribution and exchange. Still considering isolated exchanges rather than markets, Aristotle sought to discuss just exchange prices between individuals with different subjective values for their goods. Aristotle suggested three different proportions to analyze distributive, corrective, and reciprocal or exchange transactions: the arithmetic, the geometric, and the harmonic. The harmonic proportion implies a strong commitment to the subjective values of the traders.|$|R

Rihanna's vocal range spans from the low note of E3 to the high note of D5, and the song follows a sequence of Em−Bm−C−Am−Bm as its chord progression. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian commented that [...] "Rude Boy", and the album's previous single [...] "Hard", were the highlights of Rated R, praised the singer's vocal performance in the song, [...] "both of which exploit Rihanna's most appealing vocal style, a sulky, icy, monotone." [...] Michael Menachem of Billboard commented on the lyrical content of the song, and wrote, [...] "with 'Rude Boy', Rihanna delivers her <b>most</b> <b>provocative</b> lyrics and perhaps most authentic-sounding single to date." [...] Menachem also wrote about the song's composition, [...] "Steel drums are a welcome presence on the production, which gives a nod to ska and dancehall.

[...] Lipshutz continued to compare the song's lyrical message to Jeremih's [...] "Birthday Sex". Sam Lansky of MTV Buzzworthy was complimentary of [...] "Birthday Cake", writing, [...] "The only misstep on the album – not because it's not amazing (it is!), but because it's only 78 seconds long. 'Birthday Cake' is more decadent Rihanna filth, this time courtesy of sensual R The-Dream. Have any Rihanna Navy members made an hour-long mix yet?
