5|$|Historically, 4-bit <b>microprocessors</b> were {{replaced}} with 8-bit, then 16-bit, then 32-bit <b>microprocessors.</b> This trend generally {{came to an}} end with the introduction of 32-bit processors, which has been a standard in general-purpose computing for two decades. Not until the early 2000s, with the advent of x86-64 architectures, did 64-bit processors become commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Given Intel's {{history of}} {{disclosing}} details about Itanium <b>microprocessors</b> at ISSCC, this paper most likely refers to Poulson.

5|$|In 2003, AMD {{released}} the Opteron CPU, which implements its own 64-bit architecture called AMD64. Opteron gained rapid acceptance in the enterprise server space because it provided an easy upgrade from x86. Under influence by Microsoft, Intel responded by implementing AMD's x86-64 instruction set architecture instead of IA-64 in its Xeon <b>microprocessors</b> in 2004, {{resulting in a}} new industry-wide de facto standard.|$|E
50|$|However, a 32-bit <b>microprocessor</b> may {{use less}} average power than an 8-bit <b>microprocessor</b> when the {{application}} requires certain operations such as floating-point maththat take many more clock cycles on an 8-bit <b>microprocessor</b> than a 32-bit <b>microprocessor</b> so the 8-bit <b>microprocessor</b> {{spends more time}} in high-power operating mode.|$|R

50|$|NEC {{released}} the μPD707 and μPD708, a two-chip 4-bit <b>microprocessor</b> CPU, in 1971. They {{were followed by}} NEC's first single-chip <b>microprocessor,</b> the μPD700, in April 1972, a prototype for the μCOM-4 (μPD751), released in April 1973, combining the μPD707 and μPD708 into a single <b>microprocessor.</b> In 1973, Toshiba developed the TLCS-12, the world's first 12-bit <b>microprocessor.</b> The project began in 1971, when Toshiba began developing a <b>microprocessor</b> for Ford Motor Company's Electronic Engine Control (EEC) project, which went on to utilize Toshiba's 12-bit <b>microprocessor.</b>|$|R
5|$|Itanium {{is aimed}} at the {{enterprise}} server and high-performance computing (HPC) markets. Other enterprise- and HPC-focused processor lines include Oracle's and Fujitsu's SPARC processors and IBM's POWER <b>microprocessors.</b> Measured by quantity sold, Itanium's most serious competition comes from x86-64 processors including Intel's own Xeon line and AMD's Opteron line. Since 2009, most servers were being shipped with x86-64 processors.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, some of {{the science}} {{instruments}} and components had their own embedded microprocessor-based control systems. The MATs (Multiple Access Transponder) components, MAT-1 and MAT-2, utilize Hughes Aircraft CDP1802CD <b>microprocessors.</b> The Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC) also utilized an RCA 1802 microprocessor (or possibly the older 1801 version). The WFPC-1 {{was replaced by the}} WFPC-2 during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993, which was then replaced by the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) during Servicing Mission 4 in 2009.|$|E
5|$|HP {{believed}} that it was no longer cost-effective for individual enterprise systems companies such as itself to develop proprietary <b>microprocessors,</b> so it partnered with Intel in 1994 to develop the IA-64 architecture, derived from EPIC. Intel was willing to undertake a very large development effort on IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting microprocessor would be used by the majority of enterprise systems manufacturers. HP and Intel initiated a large joint development effort with a goal of delivering the first product, Merced, in 1998.|$|E

They released 386BSD via an anonymous FTP server. The development flow of 386BSD was slow and after a period of neglect, a group of 386BSD users decided to branch out on their own and create FreeBSD so that they could keep the operating system up to date. The first version of FreeBSD was released on November 1993.|$|E

In 2010, {{the two companies}} signed another $250 million deal, which obliged Intel to continue making Itanium CPUs for HP's machines until 2017.

5|$|Because {{microcomputers}} in Japan {{were not}} powerful enough {{at the time}} to perform the complex tasks involved in designing and programming Space Invaders, Nishikado had to design his own custom hardware and development tools for the game. He created the arcade board using new <b>microprocessors</b> from the United States. The game uses an Intel 8080 central processing unit, features raster graphics on a CRT monitor and monaural sound hosted by a combination of analog circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. Despite the specially developed hardware, Nishikado was unable to program the game as he wanted—the Control Program board was not powerful enough to display the graphics in color or move the enemies faster—and he considered the development of the hardware {{the most difficult part of}} the whole process. While programming the game, Nishikado discovered that the processor was able to render the alien graphics faster the fewer were on screen. Rather than design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he decided to keep it as a challenging gameplay mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The {{developer}} of Sabre Wulf, Ultimate Play the Game, {{had a reputation}} for secrecy. The company rarely gave interviews or revealed details about their internal practices or upcoming games. Little is known about their development process apart from that they used Sage IV computers, preferred to develop for the ZX Spectrum's Z80 microprocessor, and often outsourced development for other platforms, such as those that ran 6502 <b>microprocessors.</b> After releasing Atic Atac at the end of 1983, Ultimate went silent until it ran teaser advertisements for Sabre Wulf in April 1984. The company rarely depicted actual gameplay in their advertisements. They had already prepared Knight Lore, the third game in the Sabreman series, in advance of the character's introduction in Sabre Wulf. Ultimate withheld Knight Lore for about a year because they felt Sabre Wulf would not have sold as well once players saw the former's graphical advancements. Knight Lore subsequently became known as a seminal work in British gaming history and an iconic game of the 1980s for its popularization of the isometric platformer format.|$|E

25|$|This period {{also saw}} {{significant}} advances in digital audio technology. Space Invaders in 1978 {{was the first}} game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple chromatic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, though it was dynamic and changed pace during stages. Rally-X in 1980 was the first game to feature continuous background music, which was generated using a dedicated sound chip, a Namco 3-channel PSG. That same year saw the introduction of speech synthesis, which was first used in Stratovox, released by Sun Electronics in 1980, followed soon after by Namco's King & Balloon, which was an early example of multiple CPUs, using two Z80 <b>microprocessors,</b> the second to drive a DAC for speech. Multi-CPUs were used by several arcade games the following year, including Frogger, which used two Z80 <b>microprocessors</b> and an AY-3-8910 PSG sound chip, and Scramble, which used two Z80 <b>microprocessors</b> and two AY-3-8910 sound chips. In 1983, Gyruss, known for its stereo sound and musical score, utilized multi CPUs, which included two Z80 <b>microprocessors,</b> one 6809 microprocessor, and one 8039 microprocessor, along with five AY-3-8910 sound chips and a DAC for the sound. That same year, the Namco Pole Position system used two Z8002 <b>microprocessors</b> and one Z80 microprocessor, along with a Namco 6-channel stereo PSG sound chip for the sound.|$|E
