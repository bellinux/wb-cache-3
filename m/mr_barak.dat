40|$|YOUR correspondent, a {{dedicated}} student {{of letters to}} the papers, {{reached the end of}} his tether again recently, this time at yet another letter of abuse and factual error about the refugees. Racist certainly, and wrong; it should never have been published. It isn’t the first letter that a newspaper should not have published, nor will it be the last. But there is a question here that seems to have escaped notice: why don’t serious newspapers correct errors that appear in published letters? They correct errors that occur elsewhere in the paper. Are letters so unimportant? Of course not. Letter writers in the main are dealing with current affairs, and what they say has an influence. Why else would organisations and individuals try so hard, and sometimes by trickery, to have their letters published? The publicity staff of Sir Robert Askin had more than a thousand letters published by various stratagems while he was premier of New South Wales, according to his then press secretary, Mr Geoffrey Reading. The papers have tightened up since then, but no system is foolproof. The problem about letters is not opinion. The problem is the facts. Any factual errors in a mass-circulation newspaper are horribly magnified by the circulation figures. But I can think of only one notable exception to this special charter that would seem to tolerate errors in published letters, and that is where the risk of a libel writ crops up. Then there may be action. Thus, last March The Sydney Morning Herald acknowledged that some very nasty statements about Mr Chris Corrigan in a letter were untrue, and apologised for publishing it. Well and good. But there are sometimes errors of much greater public consequence that go uncorrected. Yes, on occasion another correspondent will take up the mistake, but that can’t be relied upon to happen, and in any case such a letter may simply be seen by readers as disputatious rather than authoritatively corrective. TO ILLUSTRATE the significance of such errors, here is a particular case. It requires some explanation. It concerns letters about the Israel–Palestine confrontation. These have filled many columns since the meeting at Camp David in July 2000, attended by the (then) Israeli Prime Minister, <b>Mr</b> <b>Barak,</b> and the Palestinian president, Mr Arafat, with President Clinton in America’s usual irreconcilable roles of mediator and supporter of Israel. Camp David of course failed, and this failure to reach agreement has been widely dumped on Mr Arafat. Last December, 18 months after Camp David, the Australian was still describing him as the man who “spurned” a peace agreement at Camp David. As recently as March the Australian, was still pursuing him. But was Mr Arafat the villain? That is how he has been painted by unrelenting Israeli propaganda: a man who rejected an amazingly generous peace offer because his real objective is not a peace treaty between two nations but the destruction of Israel. If the American media had been up to the task, it would have ferreted out the facts at the time. As it is, it has taken a long time for something informed and reliable to register in parts of the mainstream media here. Long enough, it seems, for a myth to have been created, which some people will stick with, regardless. The letters pages have in my view played a significant part in the establishing of this myth. Here is its succinct expression by a correspondent in the Adelaide Advertiser, who referred to Mr Arafat’s “refusal to accept Barak’s offer giving him 98 per cent of what Arafat demanded”. Nonsense, of course, but it was published. A correspondent in the Age says that “Barak’s ‘peace for land’ proposal offered the Palestinians 97 per cent of their land claims [...] including half of the Old City of Jerusalem”. To this a correspondent in the Australian adds as part of the Israeli offer a “limited ‘right of return’ to Palestinian refugees”. A correspondent in the Sydney Morning Herald shakes his head sadly, but seems unaware of the facts: “The Palestinians were offered a state by the UN in 1947 and again by Israel in 2000. It is a great tragedy for the Palestinian people that their leaders were not prepared to accept either. ” The letter writers were hardly alone. In early April, in a public statement, Australia’s Prime Minister left no room for doubt: I remain mortified that a couple of years ago, the offer [of Mr Barak], which was about 80 or 90 per cent of what the Palestinians wanted, was not accepted. The biggest error, mistake [...] the greatest area of condemnation [...] of Arafat was his failure back in the year 2000 to accept the offer Barak was making then. With all the resources available to him, how could Mr Howard be so wrong? AS FAR back as August 8, 2001, Robert Malley, writing in the New York Times under the heading “Fictions About the Failure at Camp David”, exploded what he described as the three most dangerous myths about that failure. As President Clinton’s special assistant for Arab-Israeli Affairs (1998 - 2001), Mr Malley was at Camp David, a member of the small American team. What follows now is a summarised version of his article. Myth One says Camp David was an ideal test of Mr Arafat’s intentions. Not so at all. Mr Arafat believed Camp David premature [...] Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had not sufficiently narrowed the gaps beforehand [...] and he felt isolated from the Arab world and alienated by the close Israeli-American partnership. He believed that <b>Mr</b> <b>Barak</b> was trying to avoid commitments, including a long-postponed Israeli withdrawal from parts of the West Bank and the transfer to Palestinian control of villages adjacent to Jerusalem. Mr Malley himself doubted that a conflict with roots so ancient could ever have been resolved, in the fortnight set aside, without the core issues of territory, refugees, and the future of Jerusalem ever having been discussed previously by the leaders. Myth Two says Israel’s offer met most if not all of the Palestinians’ legitimate aspirations. Well, <b>Mr</b> <b>Barak</b> did go further than any of his predecessors had gone. But to the Palestinians it was no dream offer. Israel was to annex 9 per cent of the West Bank for the settlers; in return, the Palestinians would get land from Israel equivalent to only one-ninth of the territory lost. In Jerusalem, Palestine would have gained sovereignty over many Arab districts of the eastern half, and over the Muslim and Christian quarters of the Old City. But Israel would have sovereignty over some Arab sections of East Jerusalem, and over what Jews know as the Temple Mount and the Arabs as Haram al Sharif, the site of Islam’s third-holiest shrine for the past 1300 years. The Arabs would have only the custody of Haram al Sharif, something impossible for them to accept. 	 For all the importance to Palestinians of the future of the refugees, Israel’s offer spoke only vaguely of a “satisfactory solution”, which led Mr Arafat to fear that he would be asked to swallow an unacceptable last-minute proposal. Myth Three says the Palestinians made no concession of their own. This was quite untrue. They wanted a state based on the 1967 borders, but nevertheless agreed to give up West Bank territory to the settlement blocks. In East Jerusalem, there are Jewish areas that became Israeli-ruled only by conquest in the Six-day War of 1967, and these areas the Palestinians agreed to forgo. They insisted on the refugees’ right of return, but accepted that numbers would be limited in a way that ensured Israel’s demographic and security interests. Mr Malley: “No other Arab party that has negotiated with Israel [...] not Anwar el-Sadat’s Egypt, not King Hussein’s Jordan, let alone Hafez al-Assad’s Syria [...] ever came close to even considering such compromises. ” The measure of Israel’s concessions ought not, Mr Malley wrote, to be how far it has moved from its own starting point; it must be how far it has moved toward a fair solution. In the Malley view, neither Mr Arafat nor <b>Mr</b> <b>Barak</b> met their historic responsibilities at the summit, and Mr Arafat missed some chances. But clearly Mr Malley rejects the propaganda that Mr Arafat any more than <b>Mr</b> <b>Barak</b> was to blame for the outcome. The Malley account is a limited one; {{but the point is that}} he was there. To this one can add something from Palestinian sources. They calculate that Mr Barak’s offer would have left them at the best with 15 per cent of pre-Israel Palestine. At present, the West Bank and Gaza total 22 per cent of the original territory. A generous offer? The notion is absurd. The proposed state of Palestine would have comprised four enclaves, cut up by settlements and by roads for Jews only. Palestine would have been a fragmented state, one in name only, without control over its borders, its air space and its water resources. A generous offer? A new intifada was the desperate sequel. Nevertheless, attempts to reach a settlement did not end with Camp David; some progress seems to have been made later, but no deal was reached before the advent of Mr Sharon brought a sledgehammer to the Palestinian anvil. WHAT has all this to do with letters to the papers? A good deal, really. Letters have been published with false or at best misleading statements about something of high importance. Propaganda has been given a kick along. Should such letters be published? Some people may look on the letters pages as a special case, where readers don’t expect the usual editorial standards. I take the view that in matters of fact there is no room for two editorial standards. Letters editors, good letters editors, need almost superhuman qualities to cope with the great range of affairs that threaten to overwhelm them daily. If they do not have the resources to carry out all the vital checking and liaison work needed, should they not be given them? And if significant errors in letters get into print, should they not be corrected as other errors are, and repetition be avoided? • David Bowman is a former editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald.
