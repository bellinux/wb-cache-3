25|$|Differential item {{functioning}} (DIF), {{sometimes referred}} to as <b>measurement</b> <b>bias,</b> is a phenomenon when participants from different groups (ex gender, race, disability) with the same latent abilities give different answers to specific questions on the same IQ test. DIF analysis measures such specific items on a test alongside measuring participants latent abilities on other similar questions. A consistent different group response to a specific question among similar type of questions can indicate an effect of DIF. It does not count as differential item functioning if both groups have equally valid chance of giving different responses to the same questions. Such bias can be a result of culture, educational level and other factors that are independent of group traits. DIF is only considered if test-takers from different groups with the same underlying latent ability level have a different chance of giving specific responses. Such questions are usually removed {{in order to make the}} test equally fair for both groups. Common techniques for analyzing DIF are item response theory (IRT) based methods, Mantel-Haenszel, and logistic regression.|$|E

40|$|Gas masses tightly {{correlate}} with the virial masses of galaxy clusters, {{allowing for a}} precise determination of cosmological parameters by means of large-scale X-ray surveys. However, according to recent Suzaku X-ray measurements, gas mass fractions, f_gas, appear to be considerably larger than the cosmic mean at the virial radius, R_ 200, questioning {{the accuracy of the}} cosmological parameter estimations. Here, we use a large suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study <b>measurement</b> <b>biases</b> of f_gas. We employ different variants of simulated physics, including radiative gas physics, star formation, and thermal feedback by active galactic nuclei. Computing the mass profiles in 48 angular cones, whose footprints partition the sphere, we find anisotropic gas and total mass distributions that imply an angular variance of f_gas at the level of 30 %. This anisotropic distribution originates from the recent formation epoch of clusters and from the strong internal baryon-to-dark-matter density bias. In the most extreme cones, f_gas can be biased high by a factor of two at R_ 200 in massive clusters, thereby providing a potential explanation for high f_gas measurements by Suzaku. While projection lowers this factor, there are other <b>measurement</b> <b>biases</b> that may (partially) compensate. We find that at R_ 200, f_gas is biased high by 20 % when assuming hydrostatic equilibrium masses, i. e., neglecting the kinetic pressure, and by another ~ 10 - 20 % due to the presence of density clumping. At larger radii, both <b>measurement</b> <b>biases</b> increase dramatically. While the cluster sample variance of the true f_gas decreases to a level of 5 % at R_ 200, the sample variance that includes both <b>measurement</b> <b>biases</b> remains fairly constant at the level of 10 - 20 %. The constant redshift evolution of f_gas within R_ 500 for massive clusters is encouraging for using gas masses to derive cosmological parameters.

5000|$|DIF {{refers to}} {{differences}} in the functioning of items across groups, oftentimes demographic, which are matched on the latent trait or more generally the attribute being measured by the items or test. It {{is important to note}} that when examining items for DIF, the groups must be matched on the measured attribute, otherwise this may result in inaccurate detection of DIF. In order to create a general understanding of DIF or <b>measurement</b> <b>bias,</b> consider the following example offered by Osterlind and Everson (2009). In this case, Y refers to a response to a particular test item which is determined by the latent construct being measured. The latent construct of interest is referred to as theta (θ) where Y is an indicator of θ which can be arranged in terms of the probability distribution of Y on θ by the expression f(Y)|θ. Therefore, response Y is conditional on the latent trait (θ). Because DIF examines differences in the conditional probabilities of Y between groups, let us label the groups as the “reference” and “focal” groups. Although the designation does not matter, a typical practice in the literature is to designate the reference group as the group who is suspected to have an advantage while the focal group refers to the group anticipated to be disadvantaged by the test.3 [...] Therefore, given the functional relationship f(Y)|θ and under the assumption that there are identical measurement error distributions for the reference and focal groups it can be concluded that under the null hypothesis: f (Y = 1 | θ, G = r) = f (Y = 1 | θ, G = f) ...|$|E
