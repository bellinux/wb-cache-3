40|$|Swirling flows {{are widely}} used in fuel burners and combustors to provide a central {{recirculation}} zone which intensifies mixing and stabilizes the flame. In general, in a flow with sufficiently high swirl entering through a sudden expansion, the change of the tangential velocity produces an axial pressure gradient and forms a back flow near the axis which results in a central recirculation zone. In this study, the recirculation zone was measured in an experimental apparatus consisting of a sudden expansion fed by a swirl generator of the axial-tangential type, whose swirl intensity could be varied over a wide range. Three expansion ratios of 2. 813, 2. 0 and 1. 625 were chosen in this experimental work. Velocity components at the inlet and {{at a number of}} stations downstream of the sudden expansion were <b>measured.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiments,</b> <b>the</b> recirculation zone was found to increase with swirl intensities and expansion ratios. Although the recirculating mass flow increases with swirl intensities, the diameter of the recirculation does not change greatly. In order to predict the structure of the central recirculation zone in enclosed swirling flow, a simple mathematical model of the momentum integral type is developed based on assumed velocity profile shapes both at the inlet and at the location of maximum diameter of the recirculation zone. The momentum integral method is used to solve for the recirculating mass flow. To test the model parameters against the measured values, a fitting routine for model velocity profiles is also presented.

A Nicholson-Bailey type model is developed using parameters <b>measured</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiments.</b> <b>The</b> host larvae can dier in the type of competitive behaviour that they exhibit, which can be either of a contest type or of a scramble type. If a bean contains one or more larvae of the contest type, only one of these will survive and any scramble-type larvae in the bean will be killed. If no contest-type larvae are present within a bean, multiple individuals of the scramble type can emerge from a single bean. The model assumes many genotypes, diering in the fraction of ospring of the two types. If a high per capita resource availability is maintained, then the scramble type is selected for, but if resources are limited, then the contest type is selected for.

40|$|The current thesis {{focuses on}} the {{deformation}} behaviour and strain distribution in the microstructure of ductile iron during tensile loading. Utilizing Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and in-situ tensile test under optical microscope, a method was developed to measure high resolution strain in microstructural constitutes. In this method, a pit etching procedure was applied to generate a random speckle pattern for DIC measurement. The method was validated by benchmarking the measured properties with the material’s standard properties. Using DIC, strain maps in the microstructure of the ductile iron were measured, which showed {{a high level of}} heterogeneity even during elastic deformation. The early micro-cracks were initiated around graphite particles, where the highest amount of local strain was detected. Local strain {{at the onset of the}} micro-cracks were measured. It was observed that the micro-cracks were initiated above a threshold strain level, but with a large variation in the overall strain. A continuum Finite Element (FE) model containing a physical length scale was developed to predict strain on the microstructure of ductile iron. The materials parameters for this model were calculated by optimization, utilizing Ramberg-Osgood equation. For benchmarking, the predicted strain maps were compared to the strain maps measured by DIC, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The DIC and simulation strain maps conformed to a large extent resulting in the validation of the model in micro-scale level.

Timber boards from two regrowth trees were taken from Northern New South Wales in Australia, and dried in a lab scale kiln. The pattern of variation within the two trees was similar, such that the diffusion coefficient was strongly correlated with the initial moisture content and basic density. Principal components analysis suggested that the timber boards with low basic densities and high initial moisture contents had higher diffusion coefficients. A potential reason is {{that if there is}} less wood material per unit volume, then this leaves more space for water to occupy, and there is also less resistance for the diffusive transport of moisture.

40|$|Powder mixing {{plays an}} {{important}} role in a number of industries ranging from phar- maceuticals and food to ceramics and explosives. Given its fundamental technological im- portance [1, 2], surprisingly little is known about the basic kinematics of flowing and mixing granular materials. For instance, no theory can suggest the optimal method or time required to mix medicinal powders to a specified uniformity. To suggest why this is so, consider that from a theoretical viewpoint, mixing problems appear complex and unwieldy, while from an applied viewpoint, it is often expedient to focus on the details of particular cases without ever searching for underlying structure. As a step towards uncovering basic principles, it is clearly desirable to identify granular mixing problems admitting clean and focused experi- mentation together with a healthy measure of theoretical tractability. A quasi- two-dimensional disk partially filled with differently colored passive particles and rotating about its axis seems to satisfy these requirements. This geometry could be con- sidered a two-dimensional tube or drum mixer. Because of their industrial use and because they display axial segregation bands, many people have considered three-dimensional tube mixers. To our knowledge only Hogg et al. [3 J have previously considered transverse mixing in the cross-section of a tube. Here we report the results of experiments and a model based only on geometric considerations. Comparison of mixing patterns from experiment and the simulated model shows excellent agreement. Moreover, we can predict with the model and measure mixing rates and (with differently sized particles) demixing rates as a function of the fill level f in the disk. Experimentally, the disk is thin enough for the dynamics to occur in a plane and be visually apparent. The particles are dyed table salt, which are cubes with a mean side length of 0. 5 mm. When we wish to provoke segregation, the particles are a mixture of salt and sugar balls, which have a size ratio of 1 / 5. As the cell rotates, the flat material surface rotates until it reaches an angle Of M 60 &# 0176;, at which point the static equilibrium of the particles fails and an avalanche occurs. After the avalanche the surface returns to its angle of repose 8, M 52 ". The rotation speed is slow enough so that avalanche motion ceases completely before the next avalanche begins. Note that the rotation of the disk is steady, but the motion of the surface, which causes mixing, is iterative. This is important to our being able to reduce the dynamics of the mixing to a map. We call the flow quasi-two-dimensional because, even though individual particles may move between the front and back bounding surfaces as the particles avalanche down the surface, we observe through the front and back glass covers that the macroscopic structures-boundaries, streaks, and core-extend entirely through the material layer. While individual grains in the experiment may take a three-dimensional path during an avalanche, large-scale structures remain planar. 17 The basis of the geometric model is to notice that the angles Of and 8, define a wedge. To the extent that the surface can be considered a straight line, it is the material inside this wedge that the avalanche takes from one side of the container to the other. As a first ap- proximation the motion of grains is modeled as taking the upper surface wedge and flipping it across the center line. The mixing is accomplished by a mathematical map of the wedge into itself. The results to date have used both a random map, i. e. the points in the wedge are rearranged randomly, and a simple deterministic map. Other maps could be devised to more closely probe the mixing dynamics, but the simple random map does a surprisingly good job. The geometric reasoning is not limited to circular domains. Based only on an examination of the geometry of wedges and their intersections, several predictions can be made. (1) Mixing should be faster for lower fill levels for f 1 / 2 +E whose fractional area grows as f 2 and where E is the size of the surface boundary layer. Each prediction of the model is testable and is found qualitatively in the experiments. Mixing rates are determined by tracking the positions of the centroids of the colors. The centroid positions are normalized (for both experiment and computation) to that of the whole material so each centroid starts one unit from the overall center of mass. When the material is perfectly mixed, the color centroids coincide with each other at the origin. The centroids&# 8217; orbits oscillate and decay exponentially. The decay time-constant 7 and oscillation period are measured as a function off. The simulations verify the predictions from geometric reasoning: mixing is fast for lower f and decreases to near zero at f = l/ 2, though the calculated mixing rates are consistently higher than those <b>measured</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiment.</b> As a practical matter we would like to know how efficient a powder mixer a rotating disk might be. The area mixed is A(f), where A is the area of the disk and without loss of generality we may take A = 1. The characteristic mixing time (in units of revolutions) is l/y. The most efficient operation point is that which maximizes rA(f) the area mixed per time. The maximum efficiency measured efficiency of O. $A/revolution occurs around f = 0. 2. The mixing flow in the thin drum is asymmetric with in principle a large number of de- grees of freedom. It is extraordinary that so simple a model based only on geometry does so well. For the subject of granular solids mixing the quasi-two-dimensional mixer is an excel- lent system with which to make precise measurements and physically motivated models...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{established}} a CT experimental method {{for the study}} of the water-oil displacement at pore scale. The microscopic core model made up of reservoir coring materials could truthfully reflect the surface property and pore structure of reservoir rocks. We scanned the core model at different water flooding stages using SkyScan 1174 v 2 CT scanner, and high resolution images were obtained. The present paper adopted a new image segmentation method, which depends on the discriminatory analysis constrained by the measured porosity and oil saturation. This new method improved the accuracy of image segmentation. We utilized the new algorithm to carry out the segmentation of pores and residual oil <b>from</b> <b>the</b> scanning images. The segmentation results were in agreement with those <b>measured</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> core <b>experiments...</b>|$|R

AlSic 132 up to 20 tonn machine capacity {{is used to calculate}} cycle time. There are four machining parameters i. e. melting temperature, Injection pressure, Plunger speed, cooling phase. Different experiments are done based on this parameters. Taguchi orthogonal array is designed with three levels and four process Parameters with the help of software Minitab 15. In the first run nine experiments are performed and Cycle time is calculated. Taguchi method stresses the importance of studying the response variation using the signal–to–noise (S/N) ratio, resulting in minimization of cycle time variation due to uncontrollable parameter. The Cycle time was considered as the quality characteristic with the concept of "the larger-the-better". The S/N ratio for the larger-the-better Where n is the number of measurements in a trial/row, in this case, n= 1 and y is the measured value in a run/row. The S/N ratio values are calculated by taking into consideration with the help of software Minitab 15. The Cycle time values <b>measured</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiments</b> and their optimum value for maximum cycle time. Every day scientists are developing new materials and for each new material, we need economical and efficient die-casting process. It is also predicted that Taguchi method is a good method for optimization of various Diecasing process parameters as it reduces <b>the</b> number of <b>experiments.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> literature survey, {{it can be seen that}} there is no work done on AlSic 132 die-casting process. So in this project the Pressure die casting paramete...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} a {{possible}} {{resolution of the}} famous Ehrenfest paradox [1] is offered. The paradox relates to a spinning disc and the Special Relativity Theory (SRT) applied to it. The resolution of the paradox {{is based on the}} proposition that <b>the</b> paradox results <b>from</b> an incorrect application of SRT to a system that is not in inertial motion. The centrifugal and centripetal forces resulting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rotation are always present and need to be included into considerations. Using the previously derived metric for a centrally gravitating body the effect of the centrifugal and centripetal forces can be included. When this is correctly done no paradox is obtained and it is shown that the spinning disc has flat space-time geometry. <b>The</b> <b>measured</b> data <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiments</b> conducted on such rotating systems are explained by inertial mass increase as described by SRT...|$|R
