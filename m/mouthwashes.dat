5|$|Population {{studies from}} the mid-20th century onwards show topical {{fluoride}} reduces dental caries. This was first {{attributed to the}} conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis, opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds. The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated <b>mouthwashes,</b> gels, foams, and varnishes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} a novel <b>mouthwash</b> comprised of 0. 8 % arginine, PVM/MA copolymer, pyrophosphates, and 0. 05 % sodium fluoride in an alcohol-free base (Pro-Argin™ <b>Mouthwash</b> Technology) to reduce dentine permeability. MethodsHydraulic conductance was used to assess the dentine permeability effects of the arginine <b>mouthwash.</b> Aqueous solutions containing arginine and PVM/MA copolymer were studied in the initial stage of the method development. The acid resistance was tested with a cola drink challenge. Finally, a blinded study was carried out to determine the occlusion of the arginine <b>mouthwash</b> in comparison to a negative control <b>mouthwash.</b> ResultsDentine discs treated with the arginine <b>mouthwash</b> showed an average fluid reduction of 42 %, which was statistically, significantly better than the fluid reduction for the negative control <b>mouthwash.</b> In addition, experiments using simple solutions of arginine and PVM/MA copolymer, alone and in combination, demonstrated that the combination of the two was required to provide a relevant occlusion benefit. Finally, the occlusion provided by the arginine <b>mouthwash</b> was maintained after exposure to an acid challenge. ConclusionThe exclusive combination of ingredients in the arginine <b>mouthwash</b> has been proven to be efficacious in decreasing dentine fluid flow as measured by hydraulic conductance. The new <b>mouthwash</b> works by occlusion, due to the unique combination of arginine, PVM/MA copolymer and pyrophosphates...|$|R

Aim: The aim was to compare the efficacy of 0. 2 % Chlorhexidine <b>mouthwash</b> with 0. 6 % Cranberry <b>mouthwash</b> on Streptococcus mutans. Materials and Methods: This was a double-blind, randomized parallel group clinical trial. Total sample of 50 subjects, aged 18 - 20 years, were randomly divided into two groups, Group A (25) and Group B (25) were given 10 mL of Chlorhexidine <b>mouthwash</b> and Cranberry <b>mouthwash</b> twice daily, respectively, for 14 days each. The plaque samples, which were taken from the subjects on 1 st day and 14 th day, were inoculated on blood agar plates and incubated at 37 ΀C for 24 - 48 h.

25|$|The {{cause is}} uncertain, {{but it is}} thought to be caused by {{accumulation}} of epithelial squames and proliferation of chromogenic (i.e., color-producing) microorganisms. There may be an increase in keratin production or a decrease in normal desquamation (shedding of surface epithelial cells). Many people with BHT are heavy smokers. Other possible associated factors are poor oral hygiene, general debilitation, hyposalivation (i.e., decreased salivary flow rate), radiotherapy, overgrowth of fungal or bacterial organisms, and a soft diet. Occasionally, BHT may be caused by the use of antimicrobial medications (e.g., tetracyclines), or oxidizing <b>mouthwashes</b> or antacids. A soft diet may be involved as normally food has an abrasive action on the tongue, which keeps the filiform papillae short.

2500|$|Conversely, {{some have}} {{suggested}} that medical conditions which cause genuine odor may sometimes be misdiagnosed as ORS. There are a great many different medical conditions which are reported to potentially cause a genuine odor, and these are usually considered according to the origin of the odor, e.g. halitosis (bad breath), bromhidrosis (body odor), etc. These conditions are excluded before a diagnosis of ORS is made. Although there are a multitude of different publications on topics like halitosis, the symptom is still poorly understood and managed in practice. It is recognized that symptoms such as halitosis can be intermittent, and therefore may not be present {{at the time of the}} consultation, leading to misdiagnosis. Individuals with genuine odor symptoms may present with similar mindset and behavior to persons with ORS. For example, one otolaryngologist researcher noted [...] "behavioral problems such as continuous occupation with oral hygiene issues, obsessive use of cosmetic breath freshening products such as <b>mouthwashes,</b> candies, chewing gums, and sprays, avoiding close contact with other people, and turning the head away during conversation" [...] as part of what was termed [...] "skunk syndrome" [...] in patients with genuine halitosis secondary to chronic tonsillitis. Another author, writing about halitosis, noted that there are generally 3 types of person that complain of halitosis: those with above average odor, those with average or near-average odor who are oversensitive, and those with below average or no odor who believe they have offensive breath. Therefore, in persons with genuine odor complaints, the distress and concern may typically be out of proportion to the reality of the problem. Genuine halitosis has been described as a social barrier between the individual and friends, relatives, partners and colleagues, and may negatively alter self-esteem and quality of life. Similar psychosocial problems are reported in other conditions which cause genuine odor symptoms. In the literature on halitosis, emphasis is frequently placed on multiple consultations to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, and also asking the individual to have a reliable confidant accompany them to the consultation who can confirm the reality of the reported symptom. ORS patients are unable to provide such confidants as they have no objective odor.|$|E
