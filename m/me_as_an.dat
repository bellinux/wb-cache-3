500|$|Bono {{described}} 1986 as [...] "an incredibly bad year" [...] for him, {{which was}} reflected in the lyrics.

Bono said, [...] "That's why the desert attracted <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> image. That year was really a desert for us." [...] "With or Without You" [...] was written while he was struggling to reconcile his wanderlust as a musician with his domestic responsibilities.

500|$|After {{she rose}} to {{prominence}} {{with the success}} of her major-label debut Pies Descalzos (1995), Shakira was introduced to Emilio Estefan, the most important producer in the Hispanic market at the time, by her promoter and longtime friend, Jairo Martínez. Estefan was renowned for launching the careers of various Hispanic singers, such as Enrique Iglesias, Thalía, and his wife Gloria Estefan. He decided to work with Shakira as he identified her potential to strongly break into the US Latin market and expand her commercial presence there. One of Shakira's concerns was having creative autonomy over her music. Before signing their contract, the roles and duties were defined. Estefan would be her manager and her executive producer, but she would be in charge of all the material and arrangements and have approval over the final look of the records. She later stated about her producer, [...] "He had a great respect for <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist and trusted me totally on this project". Since then, they started working on Estefan's Crescent Moon Studios in Miami.|$|E
500|$|During {{their writing}} sessions, Malay noticed Ocean's use of gender pronouns in his lyrics, but {{attributed}} it to Ocean's poetic license {{rather than his}} sexuality. In an interview after Ocean's open letter, Malay called him [...] "the new hybrid of what an MC {{used to be in}} the '80s or '90s ... the true storyteller" [...] and said of the lyrics, [...] "I don't think anyone during any given point during the creative process knew what was happening ... when he's singing maybe from a female perspective or whatever, it's a story, it's a world that he created. It's not necessarily his personal—like something that he's experiencing. Maybe it is and it's a metaphor the way he did it". They finished writing Channel Orange in two to three months. Ocean said of the album's development in an interview for Rap-Up, [...] "It succinctly defines <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist for where I am right now and that was the aim. It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness." ...|$|E
500|$|Gul Panag was {{impressed}} with Kukunoor's previous film, Rockford (1999) and her constant correspondence with him fetched her the role of Zeenat. Kukunoor felt that Panag had characteristics of someone who was lean and fit, good height, large frame, and with an appropriate skin tone. After a successful audition, she was chosen for the character that she felt was a difficult one to portray. Critiquing the actress with [...] "I see urgency, pain but no sadness" [...] and [...] "I see anger and vulnerability but no guilt", the director pushed Panag to her limits. She felt that Kukunoor was such a man of conviction that he constantly forgot to eat and this once caused him a stomach infection. Gul Panag, on the other hand, said that her role was very multi-dimensional, multi-layered and hence it was quite tough to play the character. She said that Kukunoor helped her in defining her character with ease and said, [...] "Nagesh looked at the minutest detail and was an immense support to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> actor." [...] However, Dor's executive producer, Elahe Hiptoola lent her voice for Panag in the film.|$|E

In November 2014, Toy Story 4 was confirmed to be in development with Lasseter serving as director. In an interview, Lasseter stated that [...] " [...] {{lot of people in the}} industry view us doing sequels as being for the business of it, but for us, it's pure passion...One of the things that was very important for <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist is to continue directing. When I direct, I get to work with the individual artists, with the animators." [...] In August 2015, at the D23 Expo, Lasseter said that the film would focus on the romance between Woody and Bo Peep.

Hoppus {{was interested in}} {{being a part of}} the record, but DeLonge did not want it to turn into a Blink-182 album. DeLonge contended that the involvement of Barker was to refrain from having to pay a session musician. Regardless, Hoppus felt betrayed and unresolved tension dogged the band until their 2005 breakup. [...] "Nobody talked about it. It was this strange situation that nobody addressed," [...] DeLonge told Blender. Barker felt guilty when he told Hoppus they were going to tour in support of the album: [...] "I felt like I had let him down [...] but he was ultimately more upset at Tom because they had ten years of history together before me." [...] Despite this tension, Hoppus lent vocals to the track [...] "Elevator" [...] and shared early ideas for the next Blink-182 album. In a later Reddit AMA, Hoppus concluded, [...] "The whole situation sucked. But I sang on the track because, at the heart of it, Tom and Travis are my friends.

Gaga began the performance wearing a square-shaped head piece and an all-white cape as pre-recorded boos were quickly replaced by sound of cheers. Gaga then glided across the stage and was assisted by her dancers as she changed into a black sequin leotard and performed the intricate choreography seen in the song's corresponding music video. Throughout the performance she cycled through costumes and wigs she had previously employed throughout her career. She was also dancing with a Jeff Koons blue gazing ball, and had her face painted in the style of the single cover by one of her dancers. She concluded the performance by emerging from behind jungle-like scenery dressed in a seashell bikini ensemble, wearing a bigb londe curly wig and taking a bow. Gaga collaborated with experimental theater director Robert Wilson on the performance. His designed set featured a shimmering white jungle background with letters spelling [...] "Applause" [...] suspended from tree branches. Gaga characterized the performance as: [...] "So beautiful, it is so indicative of <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist. I feel in many ways that the performance is like a giant metaphor for me."

500|$|On September 6, 1956, Raymond {{was killed}} in an {{automobile}} accident in Westport, Connecticut. Driving fellow cartoonist Stan Drake's 1956 Corvette at twice the [...] speed limit, he hit a tree and was killed. Roberts describes in his biography the circumstances {{as a result of the}} weather. Driving in the convertible with its top down, Raymond decided to reach his destination quicker rather than stop to put the top back up when rain started to fall. Drake was thrown clear of the crash, but Raymond, with his seat belt buckled, died instantly. Speculation surrounds the nature of his death, with some, Drake included, believing Raymond was suicidal. Raymond had been involved in four automobile accidents in the month prior to his death, which led Drake to say Raymond [...] "had been trying to kill himself". Author Arlen Schumer ascribes the motive for suicide as being related to Raymond's personal life. Schumer alleges that Raymond had been having affairs, and that his wife was refusing to grant him a divorce. R. C. Harvey is dismissive of this motivation: [...] "Committing suicide strikes <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> odd way for a man of Raymond's sophistication to react to his disappointment in romance". Harvey also notes that no mention of any alleged affairs is made in Tom Robert's biography, [...] "probably out of consideration to Raymond's surviving family". Drake has also been quoted as speculating that Raymond [...] "hit the accelerator by mistake" [...] instead of the brake. Raymond is buried in St. John's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Darien, Connecticut.|$|E
