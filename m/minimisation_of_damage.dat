40|$|Critical infrastructures, usually {{designed}} to handle disruptions caused by human errors or random acts of nature, define assets whose normal operation must be guaranteed to maintain its essential services for human daily living. Malicious intended attacks to these targets {{need to be considered}} during system design. To face with these situations, defense plans must be developed in advance. In this paper, we present a UML profile, named SecAM, that enables the modelling and security specification for critical infrastructures during the early phases (requirements, design) of systems development life-cycle. SecAM endows security assessment, through survivability analysis, of different security solutions before system deployment. As a case study, we evaluate the survivability of the Saudi Arabia crude-oil pipeline network under two different attack scenarios. The stochastic analysis, carried out with Generalized Stochastic Petri nets, quantitatively estimates the <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> attack <b>damages</b> into the crude-oil network...|$|R
40|$|At {{the present}} day, an unparalleled number of {{international}} actors, be it national governments or non-state groups, have acquired or {{are seeking to}} acquire both {{weapons of mass destruction}} and the means to deliver them. Those means of delivery can be Ballistic Missiles that can bridge vast – even intercontinental – distances. The use of Ballistic Missiles with conventional warheads is also an evolving threat as witnessed by the Chinese anti-ship ballistic missile. The defence of land forces and vulnerable areas against short range threats such as rockets, artillery and mortars has also become an increasingly pressing issue, due to the involvement of Western forces in the operations in the Middle–East and Northern Africa. As sophisticated technologies continue to proliferate and the intentions of actors are uncertain, an increasingly complex threat environment emerges, which stresses the importance of Missile Defence. Missile Defence aims at prevention of the launch of missiles, destruction of missiles in flight and <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>damage</b> caused by missiles after impact. Due to the increasing proliferation of missiles, their increasing ranges and the possibility that they possess a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear warhead, Missile Defence remains a topic high on the national and international defence agendas. This book has provided an overview of Missile Defence. It has described the missile threat in some detail, from general characteristics of Ballistic Missiles to their trajectories, warheads and countermeasures. Furthermore, the four pillars of Missile Defence have been presented: – Conventional Counter Force Operations, with the aim of preventing the launch of missiles; – Active Defence, with the aim of destroying the missiles in flight; – Passive Defence, with the aim <b>of</b> minimising the <b>damage</b> <b>of</b> the missiles after impact; – Battle Management, Command Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence and Early Warning, with the aim of supporting the first three pillars...|$|R
40|$|Diet as a {{key factor}} in {{determining}} genomic stability is more important than previously imagined because we now know that it impacts on all relevant pathways, namely exposure to dietary carcinogens, activation/detoxification of carcinogens, DNA repair, DNA synthesis and apoptosis. Current recommended dietary allowances for vitamins and minerals are based largely on the prevention of diseases of deficiency such as scurvy in the case of vitamin C. Because diseases of development, degenerative disease and aging itself are partly caused by damage to DNA it seems logical that we should focus better our attention on defining optimal requirements of key minerals and vitamins for preventing damage to both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. To date, our knowledge on optimal micronutrient levels for genomic stability is scanty and disorganised. However, there is already sufficient evidence to suggest that marginal deficiencies in folate, vitamin B 12, niacin and zinc impact significantly on spontaneous chromosome damage rate. The recent data for folate and vitamin B 12 in humans with respect to micronucleus formation in blood and epithelial cells provide compelling evidence of the important role of these micronutrients in maintenance of genome integrity and the need to revise current RDAs for these micronutrients based on <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> DNA <b>damage.</b> Appropriately designed in vitro studies and in vivo placebo controlled trials with dose responses using a complementary array <b>of</b> DNA <b>damage</b> biomarkers are required to define recommended dietary allowances for genomic stability. Furthermore these studies would have to be targeted to individuals with common genetic polymorphisms that alter the bioavailability of specific micronutrients and the affinity of specific key enzymes involved in DNA metabolism for their micronutrient co-factor. That {{there is a need for}} an international collaborative effort to establish RDAs for genomic stability is self-evident...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Inflammation and oedema of {{the facial}} nerve due to viral {{infection}} by the herpes zoster virus are implicated in the aetiology and clinical manifestation of Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus with facial palsy). Corticosteroids, with their powerful anti-inflammatory effect, have a potential role to play in the reduction or <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> nerve <b>damage</b> when administered together with antiviral therapy, and therefore may improve the outcome for patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of corticosteroids as an adjuvant to antiviral therapy in adult patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus with facial palsy). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to December 2007) and EMBASE (1974 to December 2007), CINAHL (1982 to December 2007), LILACS, KoreaMed, IndMed, PakMediNet, ZETOC, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts (Conference Proceedings Database), ISI Proceedings (Web of Science), the National Research Register (NRR), the UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database (UKCRN), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Research Findings Register (ReFeR) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT). SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials in which corticosteroids (by any route of administration at any dosage) were given as an adjuvant to antiviral agents in the treatment of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and trial quality of the available studies, whether they were published or unpublished. No trials were found and therefore no data were analysed. MAIN RESULTS: This is an empty review as no trials were found that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Since no randomised controlled trials investigating the use of corticosteroids as an adjuvant to antiviral treatment in Ramsay Hunt syndrome were identified, such studies are needed to assess the effects of such therapy...|$|R
40|$|Fire weather {{services}} {{ranging from}} fire weather warnings to special forecasts for hazard reduction burns are important inputs into {{the decision making}} processes of fire management authorities that enable effective decision making at various stages of fire management. For example, fire management authorities can pre-position personnel and equipment to minimise fire damage based on timely and accurate fire weather forecasts and warnings. The socio-economic value or benefit of the forecasts reflects the improvement in economic and related outcomes resulting {{from the use of}} fire weather services. The focus of this study is the socio-economic value or benefit of current and improved fire weather services aimed at prescribed burning in the Victorian region in Australia. The study has three major components. The first relates to the formulation of a conceptual framework to analyse the likely outcomes resulting from the better use of fire weather services in undertaking prescribed burning, and the associated benefits. Depending on the circumstances, these outcomes will relate to improved fuel reduction and reduced incidence of high intensity fires with extensive spread. The associated potential benefits will relate to <b>minimisation</b> or avoidance: <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to timber assets, private property and public infrastructure; of agricultural production losses; o...|$|R

This requires tsunami modelling and simulation of the local effects of the tsunami, mainly the difficult region of the last 100 m water depth to the beach and beyond. It requires the inclusion of turbulent flow and of details of the local seabed, beach, bay area and the local built environment. Perhaps the most difficult aspect is the modelling of the water including all material, such as sand, rock, coral and detritus which is picked up and deposited during the arrival, presence and departure of the tsunami. As open ocean tsunami wave simulation is already complex and difficult the local tsunami effects will be even more, thus requiring large parallel computing facilities.

This paper presents multi-objective optimisation of the CO 2 laser cutting process considering three cut quality characteristics such as surface roughness, heat affected zone (HAZ) and kerf width. It combines an experimental design by using Taguchi’s method, modelling {{the relationships between the}} laser cutting factors (laser power, cutting speed, assist gas pressure and focus position) and cut quality characteristics by artificial neural networks (ANNs), formulation of the multiobjective optimisation problem using weighting sum method, and solving it by the novel meta-heuristic cuckoo search algorithm (CSA). The objective is to obtain optimal cutting conditions dependent on the importance order of the cut quality characteristics for each of four different case studies presented in this paper. The case studies considered in this study are: <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> cut quality characteristics with equal priority, <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> cut quality characteristics with priority given to surface roughness, <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> cut quality characteristics with priority given to HAZ, and <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> cut quality characteristics with priority given to kerf width.

40|$|Quarantine {{pests and}} {{diseases}} represent a significant threat to agricultural and horticultural production worldwide. Currently, it is recognised that {{international trade in}} agricultural products, and especially in plants and plant materials, is a major vector facilitating the spread of quarantine organisms. To provide the adequate level of phytosanitary protection, the responsible agencies should allocate their limited resources in the best way, so that phytosanitary risks associated with imported products are minimised. This is however a challenging task given the constantly growing volumes of imported products, their broad assortment and large number of exporting countries. This paper suggests an optimization framework {{that can be used}} for designing an optimal import inspection policy. A theoretical part of the paper considers the optimisation problem of the quarantine agency which is constructed as <b>minimisation</b> <b>of</b> the economic <b>damage</b> from pest introduction under given constraints. The latter are budget constraints and the acceptable level of risk (ALOR) of a given country. The results of the theoretical part of the paper present the conditions for the optimal allocation of the Agency¿s resources under constraints. In the second part of the paper a quantitative model for optimal allocation of resources for inspecting ornamental plants¿ imports to the Netherlands is presented. The model shows the optimal allocation of inspection resources given the expected phytosanitary risks associated with different commodities. More specifically, the model calculates the optimal inspection time and achieved level of quarantine protection under the varying levels of ALOR representing different risk attitudes of the protecting agencies. To the best of authors¿ knowledge both the setup and the results of the presented model represent a novel contribution in the field of economics of quarantine protection...|$|R
