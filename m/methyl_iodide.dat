40|$|The {{investigations}} {{recorded in}} this thesis relate to a radiochemical study of the fates of iodine atoms recoiling after undergoing radiative neutron capture. Particular attention has been focussed upon mixtures of alkyl iodides, using the 'quasi-stable' fission product (^ 129) I (1. 72 X l 0 (^ 7) y) to fix unequivocally {{the origin of the}} recoil iodine found in the products. Techniques have been developed for the synthesis of <b>methyl</b> and propyl <b>iodides</b> labelled with (^ 129) I on a micro-scale, and mixtures of these with unlabelled alkyl iodides have been irradiated in the Harwell reactor "BEPO". Other irradiations have been made with 14 MeV neutrons from the D+T reaction; with a Ra-ɤ-Be neutron source; and with a 100 curie (^ 60) Co source. Separation (by gas/liquid chromatography) and measurement techniques have also been perfected. From a study of the distribution of the active iodine between <b>methyl</b> and propyl <b>iodides</b> it seems that the recoiling atom is more likely to appear as methyl than as propyl iodide. In the case of (^ 130) I recoils this, ratio is about 3 : 1, for (^ 128) I it is about 1. 8 : 1 and for (^ 126) I (produced by n, 2 n reaction) it is about 2. 2 : 1. The results can only be explained if it is also assumed that about 10 % of the neutron captures (in (^ 129) I) either do not result in bond rupture or lead to an immediate recombination with the residue of the parent molecule.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of diblock ionomers {{consisting of}} non ionic polystyrene blocks and ionic poly(cesium methacrylate), or poly(cesium acrylate), or poly(4 -vinylpyridinium <b>methyl</b> <b>iodides)</b> blocks in solution {{and in the}} solid state is investigated by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). When the polystyrene blocks are kept short, they self-assemble in bulk to form spherical microdomains. Furthermore, the polystyrene segments are highly stretched in the non ionic microdomains, as was also observed previously for the ionic segments of comparable lengths in the ionic microdomains. These findings {{support the hypothesis that}} chain extension in microdomains of diblock ionomers in bulk {{is the result of the}} high surface energy and not of the ionic character of one of the blocks. The presence of spherical ionic domains in diblock ionomers with short ionic blocks is confirmed by electron micrographs. An increasing size of the ionic microdomains for diblocks with a high polydispersity in the ionic chains relative to that in samples of low polydispersity is seen only in samples prepared close to thermodynamic equilibrium, such as casting from a solvent which is good for both blocks. When diblock ionomers of short ionic block lengths are dissolved in a solvent selectively good for the polystyrene block, micelles are formed which consist of ionic cores surrounded by a corona of polystyrene segments swollen by the solvent. The core size depends only on the ionic block length, and varies as the 3 / 5 power of the number of units in the ionic block, as predicted by the star model for block copolymer solutions. The ionic cores have a low polydispersity in sizes. The sizes are independent of the chemical structure, of polymer concentration, of polystyrene block length, and of solvent composition provided it is of low polarity. Water can be solubilized into the ionic cores up to a limit. Aggregation number, surface area per chain and micellar mass can be obtained from the SAXS results. The micelles show a high degree of organization in solution, as evidenced by the presence of a structure peak even at 1 % polymer concentration; up to three peaks are seen for solutions above 2 % polymer concentration.

Steranes, phytane and gammacerane are bound by polysulphide linkages in large amounts (30 % or more) in the immature Vena del Gesso sediment whereas squalane, isorenieratane and C 35 hopane carbon skeletons are hardly bound at all by polysulphide-bonds only. The amounts of polysulphide-bound carbon skeletons are much lower in samples from the Northern Apennines and the Monterey Formation and consist predominantly of n-alkanes.

The prepared films were then placed into relative humidity (RH) levels of 30, 50, and 70  % {{to test the}} moisture stability. The crystal structure, phases, and morphology were investigated with XRD and SEM/EDX. These samples exhibited good stability against long time exposure to moisture for 70  days. The XRD results showed that samples stored at RH 70  % contained {{only a small amount}} of hydrate compound after 70  days storage, while in the sample stored at RH 50  %, the formation of PbI 2 was observed. The sample at RH 30  % manifested almost no change when stored for the same storage period. We attribute the enhanced moisture stability, compared with the spin-coated samples, to a passivated surface of the perovskite film by terpineol which exhibits a hydrophobic moiety. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show that the passivation of surface defect states by the formation of either PbI 2 or hydrated compound leads to prolonged charge carrier recombination times.|$|R
