Learned Hand eventually came to understand the influences of his parents as formative. After his father's death, he looked to religion to help him cope, writing to his cousin Augustus Noble Hand: [...] "If you could imagine one half the comfort my religion has given to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> terrible loss, you would see that Christ never forsakes those who cling to him." [...] The depth of Hand's early religious convictions was in sharp contrast to his later agnosticism.|$|E

500|$|Rowe's {{illness and}} Blanchflower's arrival {{together}} signalled {{the end of}} Ramsey's playing career. Ramsey missed matches during the 1954–55 season through injury, and in April 1955 suffered what he called [...] "a terrible roasting" [...] {{at the hands of}} the Leicester City winger Derek Hogg. After Tottenham ended the season in 16th place, Rowe retired permanently; his deputy Jimmy Anderson took over and appointed Nicholson to his coaching staff. When Ramsey was omitted from a post-season tour of Hungary, despite still being club captain, he realised that his time at Tottenham had come to an end. He had played a total of 250 competitive games for Tottenham in all competitions, across six seasons. [...] "I was 35 years old and obviously concerned about my future," [...] he later wrote. [...] "I really didn't know what was going to happen to me. I knew my days as a player were numbered, and there was only one way things could go for <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> respect—downhill." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his junior}} year, Presley began {{to stand out}} more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew out his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and Vaseline. In his free time, he would head down to Beale Street, the heart of Memphis's {{thriving}} blues scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy clothes {{in the windows of}} Lansky Brothers. By his senior year, he was wearing them. Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Lauderdale Courts, he competed in Humes's Annual [...] "Minstrel" [...] show in April 1953. Singing and playing guitar, he opened with [...] "Till I Waltz Again with You", a recent hit for Teresa Brewer. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: [...] "I wasn't popular in school... I failed music—only thing I ever failed. And then they entered <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> talent show... when I came onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became after that." ...|$|E
500|$|Criss {{discussed}} his personal connection with Blaine {{in an interview}} with Vanity Fair. He explained that he grew up among the [...] "gay community", being with theater performers, so was raised without a concept of sexuality being an issue. Criss stated that, although he identifies as straight, [...] "it really doesn't come into play with <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> role. As an actor, your objective is always to play the scene. And this in case, he happens to be a gay teen." [...] Talk show host and media personality Ellen DeGeneres deemed Blaine [...] "a very confident gay teen, which is something you don't see much on television." [...] However, Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times assessed that [...] "despite the image he projects, he, too, is just a kid trying to figure things out as he goes along." [...] Criss feels that Blaine's confidence is an important aspect of his character, as it is rare for gay teenagers on television to be so [...] "sure of themselves." [...] He hopes that [...] "all the kids struggling with this issue can look to a guy like Blaine and feel [...] by his confidence." ...|$|E

500|$|The relegation of fighter {{units to}} what {{appeared}} to be strategically unimportant ground attack missions led to a crisis in morale that precipitated the so-called [...] "Morotai Mutiny" [...] in April 1945, when eight of Cobby's senior pilots, including Australia's leading ace in the war, Group Captain Clive Caldwell, tendered their resignations in protest. Although one of the [...] "mutineers", Group Captain Wilf Arthur, had earlier voiced his concerns to Cobby and his headquarters staff regarding the efficacy of 1st TAF's tasking, the AOC was taken aback by the resignations. He spoke to the officers individually and as a group, asking them, [...] "Is this something against me, or having a go against <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>this,</b> because if so, if you feel that I have fallen down in my job, I will straight away ask to be recalled," [...] to which they replied, [...] "It {{has nothing to do with}} you." [...] Cobby reported the incident to his immediate superior, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, who informed the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, and the Allied Air Forces Commander, Lieutenant General George Kenney. All made their way to Morotai and interviewed the pilots involved, and all concluded that Cobby should be relieved of his command.|$|E
