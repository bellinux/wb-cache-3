5|$|As {{a result}} of {{relatively}} intense language contact, Central Atlas Tamazight has a large stratum of Arabic loans. Many borrowed words in Berber also have native synonyms, e.g. /lbab/ or /tiflut/ 'door', the latter used more in rural areas. The contact was unequal, as <b>Moroccan</b> Arabic has not borrowed as much from Berber languages, though Berber has contributed to <b>Moroccan</b> and Algerian Arabics' very reduced vowel systems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Aims: To {{test the}} effects of data {{collection}} mode and ethnicity of interviewers on response rates and self-reported alcohol use among second-generation Turks and <b>Moroccans</b> in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Methods: Two hundred and sixty-nine Turks and 271 <b>Moroccans</b> were interviewed face-to-face, and 475 Turks and 482 <b>Moroccans</b> received a mailed questionnaire. Half of the Turks and <b>Moroccans</b> randomly allocated to the interview mode were ethnically matched to the interviewer; the remainder were allocated to a Dutch interviewer. Results: Turks and <b>Moroccans</b> more often responded to a face-to-face interview than to a mailed questionnaire. No effect of ethnicity of interviewer on response rates was demonstrated. With respect to the effects on alcohol reports, Turks and <b>Moroccans</b> tended to report a higher alcohol use in the mailed survey than in the face-to-face interview. They reported significantly more often excessive drinking in the mail survey than in the face-to-face interviews. Ethnicity of the interviewer resulted in Turks and <b>Moroccans</b> reporting a higher prevalence of alcohol use during the previous 6 months when interviewed by a Dutch interviewer compared with an ethnically matched interviewer. Conclusions: Among second-generation Turks and <b>Moroccans,</b> mail surveys seem most suitable to measure mean and excessive alcohol use. However, interviews held by Dutch interviewers {{seem to be the}} mos...|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} of Morocco in 2014 is 33,848,242. The {{overwhelming majority of}} <b>Moroccans</b> are of Berber descent. Some <b>Moroccans</b> identify themselves as Berbers through the spoken language, through a mix of family/tribal/territorial ties or through both. Other <b>Moroccans</b> identify themselves as Arabised Berbers, mostly based on them speaking Arabic or being coerced to speak Arabic and/or {{not being able to}} speak Berber. However, due to Arabisation and its policies, some of them believe they have Arab descent from the Arabian Peninsula or the Levant. Some <b>Moroccans</b> believe themselves to be of mixed Arab-Berber descent or of Arab-Berber-Andalusian ancestry. There are no official figures about the exact ethnic origins of all <b>Moroccans,</b> but the implicitly accepted idea inside and outside Morocco is that <b>Moroccans</b> are essentially mixed Arab-Berbers. However, {{a recent study by the}} National Geographic showed the majority of North Africa are non-Arabs, thus Amazigh.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Moroccan</b> Division Memorial is {{dedicated}} to the memory of the French and Foreign members of the <b>Moroccan</b> Division, killed during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915. The monument was raised by veterans of the division and inaugurated on 14 June 1925, having been built without planning permission. Excluding the various commemorative plaques at the bottom front facade of the memorial, campaign battles are inscribed on the left- and right-hand side corner view of the memorial. The veterans of the division later funded the April 1987 installation of a marble plaque that identified the <b>Moroccan</b> Division as the only division where all subordinate units had been awarded the Legion of Honour.|$|E

Based on data from 213 relatively high educated <b>Moroccans</b> who visit the popular website ‘maroc. nl’, we show that this meta-image can be empirically distinguished from a negative attitude towards outgroups. Experienced socio-economic threat is a main predictor of a negative meta-image. Next, we show with an experiment that <b>Moroccans</b> with a negative meta-image have a stronger intention to vote for the Muslim political party AEL. ...|$|R
