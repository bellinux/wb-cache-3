40|$|Purpose: To {{present a}} patient with acute {{idiopathic}} blind spot enlargement syndrome who had abnormal changes in the outer retinal microstructure limited to areas with reduced responses on multifocal electroretinograms {{as well as to}} the area involving a scotoma. Methods and Results: We report the case of a 44 -year-old man who developed an arcuate scotoma which was associated with a physiological blind spot in the left eye. The ophthalmoscopic, fluorescein angiographic, and full-field electroretinogram findings were normal. The amplitudes of the multifocal electroretinograms were reduced in the area of the scotoma. Optical coherence tomography showed that both the external limiting membrane and the inner and outer segment (IS/OS) line were intact, but that the <b>middle</b> <b>cone</b> outer segment tip line between the IS/OS line and the retinal pigment epithelium was absent in the nasal macular area of the left eye. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the integrity of not only the external limiting membrane and IS/OS line but also the cone outer segment tip line is important for the function of the retina...|$|R

The experimental technique {{is similar to that}} used in stellar speckle interferometry. It is based on the recording and posterior processing of coherent short-exposure images of a small area of the central fovea. By using this optical-digital procedure, we have obtained what are to our knowledge the first objective measurements in vivo of the cone spacing in the human fovea. The reconstruction of the whole spatial information of the cone mosaic would also be possible by further improvements of the technique by subsequent application of image-reconstruction algorithms.

40|$|Uniquely for non-primate mammals, {{three classes}} of cone photoreceptors have been {{previously}} identified by microspectrophotometry in two marsupial species: the polyprotodont fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata) and the diprotodont honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus). This report {{focuses on the}} genetic basis for these three pigments. Two cone pigments were amplified from retinal cDNA of both species and identified by phylogenetics {{as members of the}} short wavelength-sensitive 1 (SWS 1) and long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) opsin classes. In vitro expression of the two sequences from the fat-tailed dunnart confirmed the peak absorbances at 363  nm in the UV for the SWS 1 pigment and 533  nm for the LWS pigment. No additional expressed cone opsin sequences that could account for the <b>middle</b> wavelength <b>cones</b> could be amplified. However, amplification from the fat-tailed dunnart genomic DNA with RH 1 (rod) opsin primer pairs identified two genes with identical coding regions but sequence differences in introns 2 and 3. Uniquely therefore for a mammal, the fat-tailed dunnart has two copies of an RH 1 opsin gene. This raises the possibility that the <b>middle</b> wavelength <b>cones</b> express a rod rather than a cone pigment...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{perform a}} {{detailed}} clinical, psychophysical, and molecular assessment {{of members of}} 4 families with an unusual X-linked cone dysfunction syndrome associated with myopia. PARTICIPANTS: Affected and unaffected members of 4 British nonconsanguineous families. METHODS: Subjects underwent both detailed clinical examination and psychophysical testing. After informed consent was obtained, blood samples were taken for DNA extraction, and molecular genetic analysis was performed. The strategy for molecular analysis was to amplify the coding regions of the long and <b>middle</b> wavelength-sensitive <b>cone</b> opsin genes and the upstream locus control region by polymerase chain reaction and to examine these fragments for mutations by sequencing of DNA. RESULTS: The phenotype was almost identical in all 4 families, consisting of moderate to high myopia, astigmatism, moderately reduced acuity, and normal fundi. Electroretinography showed abnormal cone but normal rod responses. Psychophysical testing showed a selective impairment of long cones in combination with well-preserved <b>middle</b> <b>cone</b> and short cone function. There was no {{evidence to suggest that}} the phenotype was progressive. Molecular analysis of the X-linked opsin gene array in the 4 families indicated that affected males have inherited the same X-chromosome from their mother. In 2 families, a long/middle hybrid gene was detected. In a third family, the commonly described deleterious Cys 203 Arg amino acid substitution was identified in both the long and middle opsin genes. In the fourth family, the only abnormality was absence of a middle opsin exon 2; the cause of the protanopia in this family is uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: The X-linked cone dysfunction syndrome associated with myopia and dichromacy described here has many similarities to Bornholm eye disease, a condition previously mapped to Xq 28. Except for the Cys 203 Arg substitution in one family, no alterations in the opsin gene array were identified that could underlie the cone dysfunction. It is therefore possible that the cone dysfunction may have a genetic origin {{different from that of the}} dichromacy...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} robust search for {{distance}} extrema {{from a point}} to a curve or a surface. The robustness comes from using geometric operations rather than numerical methods to find all local extrema. Tangent cones are used to search for regions where distance extrema conditions are satisfied and patch refinement hierarchically improves the search. Instead of preprocessing and storing a large hierarchy, elements are computed as needed and retained only if useful. However, for spatially coherent queries, this provides a significant speedup.

50|$|Races {{can be done}} in dual format {{where the}} racing is a {{head-to-head}} match, or in a single lane format where the racer is only racing against the clock. There are five types of Slalom race formats: Super Giant Slalom, Giant Slalom, Hybrid Slalom (a.k.a. Special Slalom), Tight Slalom, and Banked Slalom. The Super Giant Slalom, or SuperG, is characterized by fast speeds of 30-40 mph, very long <b>distances</b> between <b>cones</b> (up to 40-50 feet) and run times of around 1 minute. Giant Slalom is similar to SuperG but is typically smaller <b>cone</b> <b>distances,</b> more <b>cones,</b> and is often time run in a single lane format. Hybrid or Special slalom is a combination of Giant Slalom cone spacings of 10-15' and tight cones spacings of 5-7' and is most often run head-to-head. Tight Slalom is characterized by very small cones spacings of 5'-7' and has the highest frequency of turns. Tight slalom skaters will pass through 3-4 cones per second. Banked slalom involves skating through a course on banked walls, such as in a skatepark or in a drainage ditch. Banked slalom is similar to other forms of slalom except that it is almost never head-to-head and the course weaves through a non-level obstacle course, as opposed to a street surface where other forms of slalom are held.|$|R

In transgenic (Tg) swine with a rod-specific (rhodopsin) gene mutation, cone photoreceptor physiology was normal for months but later declined, consistent with delayed cone cell death. Surprisingly, cone postreceptoral function was markedly abnormal when cone photoreceptor physiology was still normal. The defect was localized to hyperpolarizing cells postsynaptic to the <b>middle</b> wavelength-sensitive <b>cones.</b> Recordings throughout postnatal development indicated a failure of cone circuitry maturation, a novel mechanism of secondary cone abnormality in rod dystrophy.
