40|$|Many {{people around}} the world live in {{households}} with multiple generations of related adults (multigenerational households). Amongst certain cultures - in Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe in particular – <b>multigenerational</b> <b>living</b> has formed {{an important part of the}} cultural fabric. But <b>multigenerational</b> <b>living</b> is also an important part of the lives of millions of people in societies where this family arrangement has not traditionally been seen as ‘the norm’. This is the case in Australia, and yet approximately one in five people in Australia currently live in a multigenerational household. While some of these multigenerational households have moved to Australia from countries where <b>multigenerational</b> <b>living</b> is common, many have not. How then do people who live in multigenerational households understand their own experiences of living together, and what might this tell us about changing social expectations regarding the form and role of families in Australia? This paper presents findings of a multi-year research project on multigenerational households in the cities of Sydney and Brisbane in Australia, including a survey of 377 people, 18 follow-up diaries and 21 follow-up interviews to explore this issue. The findings of this research highlight that the stigma associated with living in a multigenerational household in Australia has lessened, and that normalised ideas surrounding the form and function of family are shifting. The paper concludes with a discussion of some potential explanations for this important cultural shift...|$|E
40|$|Multigenerational {{households}} – {{where two}} or more generations of related adults cohabit in the same dwelling – is recognised as a traditional practice amongst many African, Asian, and Eastern and Southern European cultures, yet they are also a significant sub-group {{of the population in}} the western world, including Australia. Much of the existing research into multigenerational households in Australia has focussed on the economic factors that contribute to (and sustain) <b>multigenerational</b> <b>living,</b> including intergenerational wealth transfers, the effect of global economic crises and the retraction of social welfare in many western countries. Little attention, however, {{has been paid to the}} lived, everyday experiences of such a living arrangement. This is an important omission as family structure and living arrangements can have a significant impact on individual wellbeing and quality of life. This paper draws upon the results of a web-based survey (133 responses), 16 diaries and 18 in-depth interviews with multigenerational household members in one major Australian city – Brisbane, QLD – to report on the benefits and challenges experienced by people living in multigenerational households. With the fastest growing multigenerational household population of all of the Australian cities, Brisbane serves as an excellent case study for wider, national considerations. The paper reveals that the benefits and drawbacks of <b>multigenerational</b> <b>living</b> experienced by household members appear to differ depending on the pathways through which they came to live together and the form of their <b>multigenerational</b> <b>living</b> arrangement (adult children yet to leave home, boomeranging post-relationship breakdown, older parents moving in for care etc.). It concludes with a discussion about the implications of these findings for housing and related policies that impact on the quality of life of multigenerational households...|$|E
40|$|At {{the turn}} of the twenty-first century, one-fifth of Australians (4. 3 million people) lived in multigenerational households, a form of {{familial}} living arrangement once common amongst many societies worldwide but now most usually associated with selected Asian, Middle Eastern and Southern European cultures. Recent research on multigenerational households has mainly focussed on the drivers that prompt adult family members to live together in the same household, including cultural expectations, a sense of familial obligation and external shocks like relationship breakdown or loss of employment in later life; few have shed light on the everyday outcomes of such a living arrangement. Most of the limited research to date that has considered the outcomes of <b>multigenerational</b> <b>living</b> predominantly focussed on the financial incentives that certain household members enjoy, especially the financial support the adult children generation receives from their older relatives. Evidence from a current multi-year Australian research project, however, shows that outcomes of <b>multigenerational</b> <b>living</b> are multiple and varied, including a mix of financial, social and spatial outcomes that are experienced both positively and negatively by household members. This paper highlights the findings of this research, which comprised a survey of 377 people from 367 multigenerational households, 22 solicited diaries and 21 follow-up interviews in Sydney and Brisbane. It concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings in the context of structural changes in Australian society and reflections on changing social and cultural views about the family...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{examines}} <b>multigenerational</b> <b>living</b> arrange-ments of white, black, and Latino individuals {{using data from}} the Current Population Surveys. We describe people in multigenerational households as “hosts ” or “guests. ” In terms of resources, guests have no home of their own, whereas hosts maintain an important source of independence. By age, the proportion of adults living as guests peaks in the late twenties, then declines until the late seventies. In contrast, hosting rates peak in the fties. Men have higher guest rates and women have higher host rates at almost all ages. While blacks and Latinos are more likely than whites to live in multigenerational households, those with higher incomes are less likely to live in multigenerational households and if they are living in multigen-erational households {{are less likely to be}} guests, regardless of race-ethnicity. We interpret this as consistent with the assumption that residential inde-pendence is generally preferred. Complex household structures, their determinants and consequences, are impor...|$|E

40|$|Do multigenerational (co-residential) {{families}} have protective effects on elderly health? Demographic literature on aging {{in developing countries}} has started to examine this question as the contours of global population have been undergoing dramatic changes. Nevertheless, the theoretical and empirical literature on the relative benefits for the elderly of residing in <b>multigenerational</b> households versus <b>living</b> alone, have remained remarkably elusive. In part, the empirical inconsistency {{is a result of}} a significant methodological gap in the extant literature: most empirical studies are based on cross-sectional data where the authors have been largely unsuccessful in eliminating explanations based on the possible selection effects. India offers an interesting context to study this relationship as the country experiences a growing elderly population coupled with a severe lack of institutional systems of care for the aged. This dissertation draws data from the India Human Development Survey (2004 - 05) - a nationally representative, multi-topic data set of 41, 554 households. It focuses on the relationship between household composition-whether the elderly are living independently, with children, or with other relatives-and short-term morbidity in the last month. The analysis uses standard multivariate regression models and a relatively unconventional technique-propensity score analysis to account for the endogeneity/selectivity problem. Three particularly salient conclusions are drawn from this research. First, household level analyses using propensity score methods highlight the importance of multigenerational families {{to the health of the}} elderly. These results also suggest health effects of household wealth, urban location, the number of adults in the household, and (male) gender. A second set of analyses show that multigenerational families also spend more on medical care when the elderly do get sick. Moreover the same set of household variables that predict better elderly health (wealth, urbanization, adults, gender) also predict higher medical expenditures. Finally, multilevel analyses, using district-level data from the Census of India (2001), corroborate the "urban advantage" finding and demonstrate that health of the elderly is affected not only by household compositional factors (e. g. living arrangements) but also by the larger context created by urbanization...|$|R
40|$|Non-communicable {{diseases}} (NCDs), including type 2 {{diabetes mellitus}} and cardiovascular diseases pose a grave challenge {{to the health of}} populations. A fourto six-fold increase in risk of NCDs has been documented among South Asians living in the UK, and lifestyle factors, including an unhealthy diet have been implicated. Pakistanis are the largest ethnic minority in Scotland, many of whom still prefer to live together as multigenerational families. The older generation mostly came from Punjab, Pakistan, while subsequent generations were born in Scotland. Research on food and eating practices among Pakistanis living in the UK has tended to focus on individual practices and preferences, has mostly been disease oriented and quantitative in nature, and has lacked the cultural insight needed to inform effective health promotion interventions. This qualitative study aims to fill a gap in the literature by exploring food and eating in multigenerational Pakistani, Muslim families. This study used qualitative interviews informed by the case study approach and an ethnographic perspective. Two or more adult family members of different genders and generations were recruited from eight <b>multigenerational</b> Pakistani families <b>living</b> in Edinburgh. Twenty-three interviews were conducted in total. The data were analysed thematically using the method of constant comparison. The analysis identified distinctive features and commonalities within each generation as well as {{the ways in which the}} preferences and tastes of one generation could influence the food eating by family members belonging to other generations. The older generation exhibited a need to maintain their ethnic identity through eating traditional foods such as salan and roti, and adhered to cultural and religious values and traditions. Their experiences, both before and after migration, influenced their present everyday food and eating. Almost all families had one person from the older generation who had a chronic illness, but the impact of this illness on that person’s diet and the diet of other family members varied. Within the second generation, differences were apparent according to gender and place of birth. Women juggled multiple roles as wives, daughters-in-law and mothers, and were responsible for most of the food-related chores. Preferring traditional meals and prioritising taste over health, Pakistan-born women were more likely to adhere to cultural values in relation to food-related issues than their British-born counterparts. Second-generation women accommodated the wishes of all family members, including husbands, in-laws and children, which constrained food-related decisions and their role as gatekeepers of food. Second-generation men preferred fried meaty dishes over roti and many opted out of family meals by eating food from outside the home. Children were looked after and fed by many members of the family. They often ate five meals daily, along with a variety of snacks. Feeding was seen by women, especially older generation, as a function of nurture, and well fed children as a sign of affluence. This study highlights the issues which influence and inform food and eating practices in multigenerational, Pakistani, Muslim families. It is the first of its kind not only to look at what members of different generations eat, but also how and why they eat it. It offers an insight into how continuities and change in eating practices can co-exist, leading to multiple menus and how individuals are influenced by others when making decisions about everyday foods. A range of factors, including historical experiences, cultural and religious values, familial hierarchy, identity maintenance and attitudes towards health and disease are shown to affect the diet of these individuals, which vary according to gender and generation. It is shown that the gatekeeping function is not solely restricted to second generation women, even though they are primarily responsible for food-related tasks, and multiple gatekeepers exist with varying roles. Generally, the link between food and health was not recognised by participants in this study, although some individuals had made dietary changes for health reasons. It is recommended that health promotion interventions should take into account the way members of the family influence the diet of other family members, rather than restricting the focus to the person with or at risk of a NCD or the cook...|$|R
40|$|<b>Multi{{generation}}al</b> <b>living</b> – {{where more}} than one generation of related adults cohabit in the same dwelling – is recognized as a common arrangement amongst many Asian, Middle Eastern and Southern European cultures, but this arrangement is becoming increasingly familiar in many Western societies.

40|$|Many Pacific Island {{communities}} face {{having to}} leave their homeland to other countries due to effects of climate change, extreme weather events, rising sea levels and the subsequent economic impacts. Tokelau, a country comprised of three small atolls in the South Pacific represents one of these effected communities. The extreme cultural shift from an incredibly isolated and densely populated environment where collective culture, elder governance and <b>multigenerational</b> <b>living</b> thrive, to New Zealand’s capitalist economy and individualistic family living has considerably challenged the traditional Tokelau way of living.

40|$|The global {{trend towards}} city living, {{together}} with population ageing, has precipitated significant economic, social, political and environmental shifts, leading {{to changes in}} family configurations and living arrangements. Some changes {{are directly related to}} family forms, notably delayed childbearing, increasing divorce rates and higher incidences of re-partnering while others are less directly related and include improved employment opportunities for women, delayed retirement and more complex migration patterns both within and between countries. These changes are also happening in highly urbanised Australia. As in many developed countries, the majority of recent Australian housing and urban policies have focussed on responding to the {{rise in the number of}} small and especially single-person households in urban areas. As evidence attests, however, there is also a concurrent, yet largely unrecognised, rise in the number of multigenerational households, households where two or more generations of related adults live in the same dwelling. Between 1981 and 2006 in Australia, the number of people living in a multigenerational household increased by more than 800, 000 (ABS 2011). By 2006, nearly one in four people in metropolitan Sydney (23. 1 %) and Melbourne (22. 9 %) lived in households that comprised two or more generations of related adults. The number of multigenerational households in Sydney alone totalled more than a quarter million in 2006. The share of multigenerational households as a share of all family households has also risen over this period; this is despite the concurrent increase in the number of single-person households and the overall decline in average household size. Recent Australian and international work in this area has focused on delayed home leaving amongst the younger generations (e. g. Alessie et al. 2005; Flatau et al. 2007) and the financial dis-benefits experienced by older generations as a result of this observed increase (e. g. Cobb-Clark and Ribar 2009). Some work also recognises the differences in practice in different contexts, especially the higher incidences of multigenerational households in cultures such as East Asia (Chui 2008; Izuhara 2010), Southern Europe (Billari and Rosina 2005) and the Middle East (Mehio-Sibai et al. 2009) where such household forms are more common. Evidence is also now emerging from countries where such living arrangements, while not traditional, are becoming more prominent (Gee et al. 2003) as well as the “boomerang” phenomenon, where adult offspring return to live in the parental home after periods of independent living (Kaplan 2009). The overwhelming significance of <b>multigenerational</b> <b>living</b> for Australia’s urban population raises two important questions: Who lives in these multigenerational households, and why?

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the topic related to {{the choice of a}} care about a senior. The theoretical part specifies the terms senior and disability and focuses on the issues of a senior and his/her family and the related <b>multigenerational</b> <b>living,</b> family care about seniors, health-social care about seniors and also on specific services for seniors. The empiric part was based on a structured interview, in which 8 multigenerational families living in one household from the Týn nad Vltavou region were addressed. We looked into the opinions of family members and seniors on the possibilities of the care about a senior in the research and consequently we compared their responses. The bachelor thesis reflects the difference between the opinions of seniors and family members with regard to the possibilities of the provision of care about a senior. Care provision in the natural setting is the wish of a senior, but this wish is not always identical with the opinion of a family member. Lack of information among the respondents leads to fears of institutional facilities or incorrect information and notion of the stay in such a facility. The lack of information was also obvious in the instance of the possibility of providing care to a senior when the family members rather showed worries in most cases. The respondents should thus be more aware of the possibilities of the care about a senior to be able to ensure a dignified old age for a senior, lived according to his/her ideas, so that it benefits the whole society...|$|E
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, here is {{the chapter}} 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph: Scholarship on ethnic {{minority}} families and aging has wrestled implicitly or explicitly with the understanding of a theoretical dichotomy not uncommon {{in the field of}} sociology as a whole: the role that culture plays as either an epiphenomenon and/or as an integral element of the social structure. The literature has exposed a series of social and cultural factors that shape the experiences of aging and access to services for older minority elders. Is older African American and Hispanic families’ lower use of nursing homes the result of a cultural preference or of institutional barriers? Are <b>multigenerational</b> <b>living</b> arrangements an expression of an ethnic identity or is this a survival strategy for minority families? These are some of the issues I will be discussing in this chapter. Interpretations of that basic structural versus cultural duality may derive from broader ideological perspectives, such as conservative and progressive leanings, but they may also refl ect a superfi cial framing of the concept of culture in scholarly analyses of ethnic minority families. In his study of the Puerto Rican “underclass,” La Vida, Oscar Lewis articulated the basic tenet of the culture of poverty hypothesis, often employed by conservative pundits: that poor ethnic communities develop a way of life and subculture that is at odds with the mainstream American values of competitive individualism and ultimately reproduces their disadvantageous socioeconomic position (Lewis, 1966). Absent from this perspective, however, are the structural barriers commonly faced by minority individuals and the role that ethnic culture has always played in helping minority and immigrant families adapt to the challenges of living on the margins of American society. When examining differences in the use of elder services by minority elders it is often stated that this {{is the result of a}} cultural preference among many ethnic groups for “taking care of their own,” but many studies are also pointing to factors such as fear of discrimination and quality of formal services as infl uencing families’ caregiving decision...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{urbanization}} of Ethiopian cities, the growing demand for housing in its urban areas has accelerated the development of large-scale housing projects. This has created a challenge for local authorities responsible for their development {{in a relatively short}} period of time. Therefore, current housing development follows the conventional approach where limited building types are developed and replicated with minor modifications to accommodate given site conditions. This strategy has resulted in an environment that is not suitable for the traditional lifestyle of common Ethiopian. Studies show that the lack of social and cultural considerations in the current development has hampered the quality of life of its residents. The research conducted in this paper proposes a holistic approach to large-scale housing development in order to provide optimized solutions for social mix and multi-generation family life style in Ethiopia. The holistic approach is developed within a parametric modeling environment supported by Rhinoceros 3 D & Grasshopper and its plug-ins in order to enhance design feasibility studies. The approach is based upon four major components such as 1) social and cultural factors, 2) a neighborhood model of urban typology, 3) a financial model and 4) a massing study model that delineates the possible building variations. A research project location in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia is selected as a test site for the proposed development strategy. The site is part of a large informal settlement that was demolished and replaced by a typical low-cost housing development composed of four and seven story towers. The goal is to generate an alternative building typology based on the new holistic approach, which meets the social, cultural and economic needs of tenants. Analysis of informal settlements in Addis Ababa has identified <b>multigenerational</b> <b>living,</b> socially and financially mixed communities as important ingredients for building a sustainable community. It was also discovered that semiprivate spaces, circulation paths and scalable housing units as key spatial variables that are necessary for the successful cultivation of these communities. Based upon the analysis of social and cultural factors of given urban district, a neighborhood model is developed from existing site context and defined as a space holder for including various architectural programs such as different unit types (studio, one-bed, two-bed), spatial definitions (private, semiprivate, public), and circulation (vertical and horizontal). The financial model is based on the optimization among the three criteria including market value, construction cost, and government incentives in order to provide tangible benefits for encouraging various income groups to participate in this social mix largescale housing community. The financial model guides the direction of generating massing model variations with the parametric application in the boundary of the neighborhood model in terms of 1) number of units, 2) arrangement of spatial definitions, and 3) configuration of circulation. The direct connection between financial model and massing model within neighborhood boundary condition allows a developer to review design alternatives with changing numbers, at the same time, an architect to understand a financial condition of each alternative with modifying designs...|$|E
