5000|$|In 1923, the Zero Milestone {{was set on}} {{the north}} side of the Ellipse, {{intended}} to be on the same meridian and to be the zero <b>mileage</b> <b>point</b> for all United States roads (but never was). It is a granite pillar about 18 in square and about 3.5 ft tall. NGS gives its longitude as 77°02'11.57375"W (NAD 83) [...] (likely error less than two centimeters).|$|E
50|$|All cards {{accumulate}} <b>mileage</b> <b>points</b> whereas MIC cards can, when registered, also accumulate Tamarun points.|$|R
50|$|However, cards {{issued by}} MIC, once {{registered}} online, can also accumulate Tamarun points through purchases {{paid for with}} the card at participating vendors. Once acquired, Tamarun points can be used at these vendors to make purchases of goods, but unlike <b>mileage</b> <b>points,</b> these points cannot automatically be used as transportation fare.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of point systems for Manaca cards: <b>mileage</b> <b>points</b> and Tamarun points. The point systems vary {{depending}} on the card's maker, either MIC or the Nagoya Transportation Development Organization. The maker of the card is printed {{on the back of the}} card in the bottom left.|$|R
25|$|Before camp {{started in}} 1967, Roberts took a {{contingent}} of the summer camp Scout craft staff on a training hike. George St. Clair led the first group to complete the hike that summer, and two more troops completed the trek that year. Camp sites, <b>mileage</b> <b>points,</b> and GPS coordinates are shown in the table. Each Scout who finished the long hike was awarded the Double Cone Trek patch. The trek, part of the camp's former high-adventure program, is no longer supported.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mileage</b> <b>points</b> are {{accumulated}} {{from spending}} money stored on the manaca card as transportation fare, such as from riding the subway or non-JR trains. These points are calculated each month and {{are sent to}} the [...] "point center" [...] every month on the 10th, they are not automatically credited to the card. In order to use them as fare, they must {{be transferred to the}} card, which can be done at a charging station, ticket machine or ticket window. Despite interoperability with JR Central's TOICA service, points cannot be used for JR train fare and are not accumulated by using JR services.|$|R
50|$|In July 2013, {{the company}} {{declared}} Hyundai Card Chapter 2, a streamlining scheme of its product portfolio. All products were trimmed {{according to the}} two main pillars - <b>point</b> <b>mileage</b> and cashback—and instead the customers were given the choice to use their <b>point</b> <b>mileage</b> and cashback freely if they met with a certain usage standard.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} issue of taxation on customer loyalty programs (so called “mileage programs”). We refer to a case in business practice in order to closely observe {{the appropriateness of the}} current taxation system. The Company addressed (hereafter “Company”) maintains both tax-exempt and taxable operations. The controversy arises when the points earned in the tax-exempt business are exchanged for services, provided by the taxable operations. While it is frequently argued that the transactions of such nature should be taxed, we conclude that they are not liable for taxation based on the related laws and regulations. Offers for free service in discussion contravenes the legally defined range of service provided and what’s more, the points earned do not carry monetary value. Furthermore, the current value-added tax laws confine property liable for taxation to goods under the article No. 48. Also, the revenue from service made by <b>mileage</b> (the <b>points)</b> should be excluded from the tax base according to the reinterpretation of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance Case No. 319 (March 29, 2006) However, here arises the controversy. When points are utilized as a means of payments, they are expected to be subject to taxation. The same logic is to be implemented in the light of tax equality. Meanwhile, once value-added tax is imposed on the revenue made by <b>mileage</b> (the <b>points),</b> it would largely impact the industry offering loyalty programs to its customers. Thus, it is necessary to establish tax laws and regulation...|$|R
50|$|M∙M2∙M3 Edition2, point cards, add extra M <b>point</b> <b>mileage</b> {{according}} {{to the amount of}} money being swiped, on top of the basic mileage accumulated; T3 Edition2 is a travel and mileage card; M CHECK, has a debit function to withdraw from one’s bank account directly upon use while piling M-point mileage; M HYBRID is a hybrid card performing both check card and credit card functions.|$|R
50|$|By 1900, the {{original}} Thousand Mile Tree {{had died and}} it was removed in September of that year. Later modifications to the line reduced the <b>mileage</b> at that <b>point</b> from 1000 miles to 959.66 mi, but in 1982, Union Pacific planted a new tree to commemorate the site. This particular tree stands today within a special fenced enclosure along {{the original}} transcontinental line, where it has grown to over 30 ft tall.|$|R
50|$|Further {{evidence}} of the government's involvement in encouraging western settlement was the publication of The Prairie Traveler, published in 1859, three years before the Homestead Act's passage. Randolph B. Marcy, Captain of the U.S. Army was commissioned by War Department to provide a guide for those moving west. It provided not only <b>mileage</b> and stopping <b>points</b> during travel but also gives advice about what {{to take on the}} journey, how to interact with Native Americans and also how to respond to threatening situations such as encounters with bears.|$|R
40|$|The private motor {{vehicles}} are significantly important {{means of transportation}} in modern lifestyle, however, these also contribute to {{a large proportion of}} the total air pollution and primary energy consumption. In order to develop green transportation system, it becomes imperative to use integrated technologies to achieve reduced emissions and utilize renewable energy. Electric vehicles (EVs) have been considered as one of these technologies to transform the traditional vehicle mix. However, the uptake of EV has been debated on factors like cost, performance (autonomous <b>mileage),</b> charging <b>point</b> infrastructure construction, energy saving, policy and end users’ adaptation. Present study investigates the technology feasibility (which usually refer to EVs’ cost, EV charging, supplier’s customer services quality, EV travel performance) and users’ adaptation of EV in Beijing, which is a key driver for the EV uptake into the Beijing transportation system. The relevant data have been collected and analyzed in the form of questionnaire survey around all of these factors. While considering the user perception and satisfaction, safety of charging and energy bills have also been investigated. According to the data analysis, it has been found the policy of ‘No traffic restrictions for EVs’ (the traffic restrictions means for certain date, from Monday to Friday the {{motor vehicles}} with the last register number of 1 and 6, 2 and 7, 3 and 8, 4 and 9, 5 and 0, are restricted to travel, respectively), the availability of the charging infrastructure and technical support are the most significant factors affecting the users’ opinions on using EVs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Quasi-elastic {{contact method}} {{can be used}} to study the wheel-rail contact {{relationship}} of worn tread. In this paper, wheel-rail contact relationship of standard and worn LMA tread have been calculated under the condition of rigid contact and quasi-elastic contact. By comparing with rigid contact which produces sharp contact points with a large dispersion, quasi-elastic contact results in uniformly smooth contact points without jump, what’s more, it’s more content with the real wheel-rail contact conditions. And also quasi-elastic contact has a significant effect on the worn tread under different operation <b>mileage.</b> Wheel-rail contact <b>point</b> distribution under different mileage is calculated, and according to tread band, a new measurement of wheelset lateral displacement is developed, which provides a simple way to determine the wheel set lateral displacement only by observing and measuring the tread contact band under different operation mileage. The wheel-rail contact relationship calculation method has been used to the real worn wheel profile test process, where the theory analysis results agreed with the real experiment results well to some extent...|$|R
5000|$|We {{have known}} René Menzies {{a long time}} now... It was {{therefore}} {{not much of a}} surprise at 1.30pm on December 31, 1951, just as we had closed for press, to get a 'phone call from René saying he was starting his record at midnight. 'Yes, René,' we said. [...] "Which record?"'Why, of course, the year's mileage record, of course!...' Only four watched that story translated into reality as we saw him off at about twenty past midnight on January 1, 1952. He started without much trade support, but with supreme confidence in his ability to command it as he went along. 'I post my first card from the post office at Marble Arch,' he called out... Since then these cards have showered on our office - there must have been well over 1,000 of them. Each one was signed {{at the start of a}} day's ride, at the 'turn', and again at the finish by anybody who happened to be around (postmen, policemen and pull-up-for-carmen-café workers were the chief witnesses), the <b>mileage</b> at each <b>point</b> being logged according to the speedometer reading.|$|R
