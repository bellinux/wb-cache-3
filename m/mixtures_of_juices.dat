40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that consumption of vegetables and fruits are positively related to lower incidence of several chronic noncommunicable diseases. Although composition of fruit and vegetable juices is {{different from that of the}} edible portion of fruits and vegetables, they contain polyphenols and vitamins from fruits and vegetables. Drinking vegetable and fruit juices is very popular in many countries, and also an efficient way to improve consumption of fruits and vegetables. The studies showed that fruit and vegetable juices affect cardiovascular risk factors, such as lowering blood pressure and improving blood lipid profiles. The main mechanisms of action included antioxidant effects, improvement of the aspects of the cardiovascular system, inhibition of platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory effects, and prevention of hyperhomocysteinemia. Drinking juices might be a potential way to improve cardiovascular health, especially <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> <b>juices</b> because they contain a variety of polyphenols, vitamins, and minerals from different fruits and vegetables. This review summarizes recent studies on the effects of fruit and vegetable juices on indicators of cardiovascular disease, and special attention is paid to the mechanisms of action...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a product {{potentially}} symbiotic by applying vacuum impregnating over Andean blackberry slices immersed in three solutions: a solution of fructooligosaccharides (FOS), natural blackberry <b>juice,</b> and a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> fruit <b>juice</b> and solution <b>of</b> FOS, inoculated with Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 with 109 UCF/mL.

40|$|The {{importance}} of »functional foods« {{in the world}} is increasing, and the procedures for their production are under intense development. The goal {{of this paper is to}} optimise the production of a functional food additive based on beetroot juice (Beta vulgaris L.) using brewer’s yeast autolysate. In order to improve the nutritive properties of the product and to preserve it, the possibility <b>of</b> beetroot <b>juice</b> fermentation using a Lactobacillus species has been investigated. Comparative investigations of three bacteria cultures (L. plantarum A 112, L. acidophilus BGSJ 15 - 3 and L. acidophilus NCDO 1748) during fermentation in two media, beetroot <b>juice</b> and a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> beetroot <b>juice</b> with an autolysate of brewer´s yeast, have been performed. The poorest fermentative activity and growth in both substrates was observed using the L. acidophilus NCDO 1748 culture. The two cultures demonstrated better fermentative activity in the <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> tested substrates, while acidifying activity (production of lactic acid and a decrease in pH) of the L. acidophilus BGSJ 15 - 3 culture was considerably better than that of the L. plantarum A 112 culture. L. plantarum A 112 culture showed better growth than L. acidophilus BGSJ 15 - 3. From the results obtained, it has been concluded that the L. plantarum A 112 and L. acidophilus BGSJ 15 - 3 can be successfully used for fermentation <b>of</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> beetroot <b>juice</b> and brewer’s yeast autolysate in order to obtain a functional food additive...|$|R
