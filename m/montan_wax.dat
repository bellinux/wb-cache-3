The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a [...] "metallic soap", containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, <b>montan</b> <b>wax,</b> stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut [...] "wax" [...] sound discs would {{be placed in a}} vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual [...] "plating" [...] of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, [...] "matrix" [...] or [...] "father". The [...] "father" [...] is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a [...] "mother". Many mothers can be grown on a single [...] "father" [...] before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The [...] "mothers" [...] are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as [...] "sons". Each [...] "mother" [...] {{can be used to make}} many [...] "sons" [...] before deteriorating. The [...] "sons" [...] are then converted into [...] "stampers" [...] by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the [...] "father"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a [...] "son" [...] (for each side), the [...] "father" [...] is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the [...] "two-step process" [...] (as it does not entail creation of [...] "sons" [...] but does involve creation of [...] "mothers", which are used for test playing and kept as [...] "safeties" [...] for electroforming future [...] "sons") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The [...] "sons" [...] made during a [...] "three-step" [...] electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than [...] "fathers".|$|E

Bitumen/wax blends were produced by addition of controlled quantities of different type of wax to a 70 / 110 unmodified bitumen. Five different waxes were used, including synthetic hydrocarbons Fischer-Tropsch <b>wax,</b> <b>Montan</b> <b>waxes</b> and amidic-modified waxes. Blends were subjected to different rheometric and thermal testing to relate their characteristics with those of the wax in temperature ranges of technical interest. It was found that bitumen/wax blends have a peculiar and quite complex mechanical response, connected with the melting/crystallizing properties of the wax and the degree of residual crystallinity into the blend. The effects of wax on the binder rheology were found to be mainly controlled by the compositional characteristics of the wax.

In his quantitative analysis he found that there is just 0.1 % of the whitish to dark yellow wax in sugarcane. [...] In 1909, more than 60 years later, the Frenchman A. Wynberg was granted a patent for the production of sugarcane wax by extracting it out of the bagasse. [...] During World War I, one of the first companies that produced large amounts of sugarcane waxes established in the South African province Natal. Already in 1924, 6000 tons of dark sugarcane wax were produced there. This amount was mainly used for the production of candles for the Russian Orthodox Church. Because of the Russian Revolution and the associated war against the church the consumption of sugarcane wax decreased so much that the company had to be closed. In the following period, sugarcane wax was produced in the USA, mainly in Louisiana where there were up to 22 sugarcane wax producers. Already in 1922, M. Rindl described applications for sugarcane wax in detail, for example as substitute for Carnauba, Bee and <b>Montan</b> <b>waxes.</b>|$|R

Wax treated wood is designed for outdoor use, therefore it is of considerable importance to elucidate the influence of weathering on the photodegradation processes.

In order to test this hypothesis, three types of wax emulsions at two different concentrations were vacuum impregnated into Norway spruce wood specimens: an emulsion of <b>montan</b> <b>wax</b> (LGE), an emulsion of polyethylene (WE 1) and an emulsion of oxidized polyethylene (WE 6) wax.

Chemical and morphological changes at exposed surfaces were also investigated with FTIR spectroscopy and SEM. In parallel, the uptake of wax emulsions and water into the axial surfaces of samples was determined with a tensiometer. The moisture content measurements showed that the best hydrophobic effect was achieved with LGE treated wood, where the lowest colour and FTIR changes were observed as well.

The impact of wax modification on binder, binder/filler mixtures and mastic asphalt was investigated in the laboratory. Wax modified binder properties were determined using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and conventional tests (softening point, penetration, elastic recovery, breaking point, viscosity and storage stability). The bending beam rheometer (BBR) was used for determining low temperature creep compliance and the tensile stress restrained specimen test (TSRST) for determining low temperature fracture. The fatigue cracking behavior of mastic asphalt was investigated using Superpave Indirect Tensile Test (IDT). Based on HMA Fracture Mechanics the influence of wax on the asphalt mixture resistance to fatigue and brittle cracking has been evaluated. The addition of wax to the polymer modified binder resulted in a viscosity reduction at higher temperatures, indicating a possible lower production and laying temperature as compared to asphalt without wax additive. DMA and BBR results showed some increase in stiffness and a more elastic response of the wax modified binder at medium and low temperatures. The TSRST fracture temperature was higher for the mastic asphalt containing wax, indicating a certain negative impact of wax modification. QC 20111208 </p...|$|E

40|$|The current {{interest}} in energy saving asphalt production techniques is great and several new processes {{have been developed}} to reduce the mixing and compaction temperatures for hot mix asphalt. In particular, mastic asphalt products (Gussasphalt) require high working temperatures, and harder requirements concerning bitumen fumes and carbon dioxide emissions have been introduced for such products. Consequently, the need of a new means of producing and placing mastic asphalt at lower temperatures is particularly large. One way of reducing asphalt mixture temperature is by using special flow improving additives like wax. This technique has successively been tried in several studies for polymer modified mastic asphalt used for bridge decks and parking areas in Sweden. However, there still are uncertainties about possible negative impact on crack susceptibility at lower temperatures due to the addition of wax. In this study, 4 % <b>montan</b> <b>wax</b> (Asphaltan A) was used for one particular polymer modified mastic asphalt product. Type and amount of wax additive was selected based on results from earlier studies. The impact on binder, binder/filler mixtures and mastic asphalt from production was tested in the laboratory, focusing on low temperature performance. The bending beam rheometer (BBR) was used for determining low temperature creep compliance and the tensile stress restrained specimen test (TSRST) for determining fracture temperatures. Binder properties were determined using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and conventional tests (softening point, penetration, elastic recovery, Fraass breaking point, viscosity and storage stability). Aging was performed using the rolling thin film oven test (RTFOT) at 200 °C. As expected, the addition of wax to the polymer modified binder showed a viscosity reduction at higher temperatures, corresponding to a similar positive effect of more than 10 °C on production and laying temperature for the mastic asphalt. DMA and BBR results showed some increase in stiffness and a more elastic response of the wax modified binder at medium and low temperatures. The TSRST fracture temperature was 5 °C higher for the mastic asphalt containing 4 % wax, indicating however no dramatic negative impact on crack susceptibility...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{consists of a}} literature review, presented in two papers, and another six papers describing experimental studies {{of the influence of}} different kinds of wax and polyphosporic acid on bitumen and asphalt concrete mixture properties. The literature review should give an extensive description of the field of knowledge concerning wax in bitumen. Effects of wax in crude oil, bitumen and asphalt concrete as well as test methods for studying these effects are described. Theories behind possible mechanisms are also discussed, and commercial wax as additive to bitumen for different purposes included. The experimental parts comprise laboratory studies involving totally five 160 / 220 penetration base bitumens from different sources, two isolated bitumen waxes, five commercial waxes and one polyphosphoric acid. Asphalt concrete slabs, containing base or modified bitumen were prepared and tested. Binder properties were evaluated using different types of laboratory equipment, such as dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), bending beam rheometer (BBR), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), force ductilometer, as well as equipment for determining conventional parameters like penetration, softening point, viscosity, and Fraass breaking point. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC-FID) were used for chemical characterization. The binders were aged by means of the rolling thin film oven test (RTFOT) and pressure ageing vessel (PAV) in combination. Asphalt concrete properties were evaluated at low temperatures using the tensile strain restrained specimen test (TSRST) and creep test at - 25 °C. Dynamic creep testing was performed at 40 °C, as well as complex modulus tests between 0 and 20 °C. Binder test results indicated that the magnitude and type of effect on bitumen rheology depend on the bitumen itself, type of crystallizing fraction in the bitumen and/or type and amount of additive used. Bitumen composition was found to be of decisive importance. Adding polyethylene wax or polyphosphoric acid, especially to a non-waxy 160 / 220 penetration grade bitumen, showed no or positive effects on the rheological behaviour at low temperatures (decrease in stiffness) as well as medium and high temperatures (increase in complex modulus and decrease in phase angle). However, the corresponding positive effects could not be shown in dynamic creep testing (at 40 °C) of asphalt concrete mixtures containing these modified binders. Adding FT-paraffin decreased the physical hardening index for all bitumens. Also polyethylene wax and <b>montan</b> <b>wax</b> showed this effect for some bitumens. Slack wax showed a large increasing effect on physical hardening, and polyphosphoric acid none or a minor negative effect. No correlation between physical hardening index (PHI) and wax content by DSC was found in this study, involving both natural bitumen wax and commercial wax. Addition of the commercial waxes used showed no or marginally positive influence on bitumen ageing properties for the bitumens and test conditions used. Comparing asphalt mixture test results to the corresponding binder test results, the effects on asphalt mixtures from adding commercial wax or polyphosphoric acid were less evident. Significant binder physical hardening by BBR could not be confirmed by TSRST. QC 2010100...|$|E
40|$|Combustion and {{gasification}} under slagging {{conditions are}} {{key aspects of}} the design of modern entrained-flow reactors for thermal conversion of solid fuels, aimed at increasing the overall energy efficiency. In these systems, solid particles migrate toward the reactor walls, due to swirled/tangential flow induced in the reaction chamber and to turbophoresis, generating, thanks to the very high operating temperatures, a slag layer that flows along the reactor internal walls and is drained {{to the bottom of}} the reactor. The recent literature on entrained-flow gasification has addressed the fate of char particles as they impinge on the wall slag layer. Different micromechanical char–slag interaction patterns may establish, depending on the stickiness of the wall layer and of the impinging char particle (namely sticky wallsticky particle, non sticky wallnon sticky particle, non sticky wallsticky particle and sticky wallnon sticky particle regimes). This study aims to contribute to the development of a phenomenological model of the fate of coal/ash particles which considers the establishment of particle segregated phases in the near-wall region of the gasifier. In particular, near-wall phenomena were investigated and mechanistic understanding of particle–wall interaction patterns in entrained-flow gasifiers was pursued using the tool of physical modeling. <b>Montan</b> <b>wax</b> was used to mimic, at atmospheric conditions, particle-wall interactions relevant in entrained-flow gasifiers. As a matter of fact, this wax had rheological/mechanical properties resembling under molten state, those of a typical coal slag and, under solid state, those of char particles. Experiments have been carried out in a lab-scale cold entrained-flow reactor, optically accessible, and equipped with a nozzle whence molten wax atomized into a mainstream of air to simulate the near-wall fate of char/ash particles in a real hot environment. Reactor lengths in the range 0. 1 – 0. 6 m were investigated, while the wax was atomized at a temperature of 100 – 110 °C. The four particle-wall interaction regimes were investigated. Assessment of the flow and segregation patterns was based on direct visual observation by means of a progressive scan CCD video camera, while the partitioning of the wax droplets/particles into the different phases was characterized by their selective collection at the reactor exhaust. Results showed that the particle-wall interaction mechanisms and segregation patterns are deeply affected by the stickiness of both the wall layer and the impinging particle. In particular, the partitioning results of the wax into the lean-dispersed phase and the wall layer indicated that sticky particles mainly adhere on the wall surface, regardless the stickiness of the wall, whereas non sticky particles may rebound, deposit and be resuspended into the main flow upon the impact on a dry wall, depending also from the local hydrodynamic conditions. As regards the interaction of non sticky particles with a sticky wall, the partitioning results lie between those obtained for the other regimes. Moreover, from a phenomenological point of view, particles follow the gaseous streamlines at the center of the duct, as expected in dilute particle-laden flows. On the other hand, the particle flow pattern in the near-wall region is barely influenced by the gas flow, whereas it is strongly affected by particlewall micromechanics, which induces particle segregation and accumulation phenomena. It is possible to conclude that micromechanical interaction of a particle with a sticky wall enhances particle transport to the wall and the tendency to reach a segregation-coverage regime with the formation of a dense-dispersed phase in the near-wall of the reactor. Another kind of experiments was also accomplished, in order to study the micromechanical particle-wall interaction. To achieve this objective, a proper lab-scale apparatus was designed and built up, in which high speed imaging and tracking of wax particles impacted onto a flat surface at near-ambient conditions were carried out. Particle–wall collision was described in terms of normal and lateral restitution coefficients and capture efficiency. The influence of the particle stickiness, impact velocity and angle, and surface properties and structure of the target on the rebound patterns was studied. Results indicated that the elastic–plastic adhesive model provides an adequate representation of the non sticky particlewall collisions. Moreover, the presence of a powder layer on the target favours energy dissipation and accumulation of particles close to the surface. This pattern promotes the establishment of a dense-dispersed phase in the near-wall zone of entrained-flow slagging gasifiers. Increasing the temperature, particles shift from the solid/plastic to the fluid state and the coefficient of restitution drops to vanishingly small values, confirming that deposition is the prevailing phenomenon during the collision of sticky particles on a wall...|$|E
