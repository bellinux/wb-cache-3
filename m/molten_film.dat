30|$|In our study, the {{nitrogen}} gas flow generates extra turbulence in expanding the plasma. As a result, the plasma species experience many collisions with each other, {{resulting in the}} formation of larger droplets. The longer pulse creates high temperature in the target surface, resulting in most of the redeposited droplets being spread into the film before getting cooled down into their original shape using nitrogen gas. There are still chances of forming smaller droplets in the plasma vaporization since plasma species interaction is very random. However, the smaller droplets are most likely to get dissolved into the surface molten layer because of the higher target surface and <b>molten</b> <b>film</b> temperatures. At 428 -fs pulse width, as seen in Figure  5 b, there are a significant number of nanotips growing from the <b>molten</b> <b>film.</b> When the laser pulse width was further increased to 714 fs, {{a very small number of}} nanotips are found to be growing even though it formed from the molten target material, as observed in Figure  5 c. This might be due to the fact that during the 714 -fs pulse interaction with the target surface, a very large amount of molten material is created which gets ejected into the plasma as well as pushed around the drilled hole due to the shock waves in the plasma. As a result, very short nanotips are observed to be growing from relatively large liquid volume of molten glass, as seen in Figure  5 c.|$|E

In this method, liquid metal flew toward a vertical stainless steel rod which was self revolving on its axis. Molten alloy was {{spread around the}} rod surface under the effect of rotating, which caused supercooling and induced nucleation of primary Si particles (PSPs) in the molten metal. This process is called Rotating-Rod Induced Nucleation (RRIN). The influence of rotating speed on the microstructures of the semi-solid slurry was studied. The refining mechanism of PSPs was also analyzed according to the change of the spreading state, the number of PSPs in per unit area (N), {{and the distribution of}} PSPs size under a series of different rotating speeds. The results showed that, the uniform supercooling in the whole <b>molten</b> metal <b>film</b> was obtained under the condition of higher rotating speeds such as 500 and 600 r/min, which promoted nucleation of the PSPs significantly.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{injection}} moulding, {{long glass}} fibre reinforced thermoplastics (LGFT) are an attractive way to produce large parts at low cost. However {{the strength of the}} part depends chiefly on the average fibre length, fibres which are subjected to considerable attrition during processing in conventional three stage screws. In this study, two models of fibre breakage are considered: The first mechanism is specific to plastication during which a fibre anchored at one end in the solid bed is submitted at the other end to the intense shear existing in the <b>molten</b> <b>film,</b> close to the barrel. The thickness of the <b>molten</b> <b>film</b> and the shear stress applied to the fibre vary with polymer viscosity, fibre strength and dimensions, and process parameters. As the melting of the solid bed progresses, more fibres are unlayered and submitted to bending. When the bending stress applied exceeds the fibre strength, the fibre breaks. This results in bimodal fibre length distributions. The sensibility of the model to main processing parameters such as screw rotation, initial fibre length, viscosity, barrel temper-ature and screw geometry is also investigated. The second mechanism addresses the fibre breakage occurring at a later stage in the process, when the screw channel is completely filled with melt. The basis for this {{is to look at the}} fibre as an array of bonded spheres. The flexibility of the fibre model is altered by changing the bending, stretching and twisting strength of the bond connecting adjacent spheres. The motion of the fibre in the flow field is determined by solving the translational and rotational motion equations for individual spheres under hydrodynamic forces and torques exerted on them. Again, the fibre fractures at the bond at which the applied stress exceeds the fibre strength...|$|E

40|$|Laser-Induced Forward Transfer (LIFT) [1] of micro- and {{nano-scale}} droplets is {{a relatively}} well-understood process experimentally [2, 3]. By careful control of the applied laser fluence to just melt through a thin source film (the donor), {{it is possible to}} transfer single droplets of the film to a receiver substrate placed nearby. Such droplets can be micron [2] or sub-micron [3] in diameter and have potential applications in plasmonic devices. The process is inherently complex involving laser-induced phase changes (which may be non-thermal on femtosecond timescales), droplet growth from fluid flow in thin <b>molten</b> <b>films,</b> moving boundaries, and the flight dynamics of the droplet during transfer and upon impact at the receiver. At present, a complete model that encompasses all these different phenomena is still lacking. However, an approximate numerical model of the process would be highly desirable so that the various experimental parameters (laser fluence, donor thickness, donor-receiver separation etc.) can be optimised for minimum droplets sizes and close deposit spacing. One method of modelling highly complex processes is to use cellular automata [4]. In a cellular automaton, the spatial domain is split into a regular grid of cells whose states evolve in time according to a set of rules based on the states of neighbouring cells.

Depending on the process, nanoimprint resists can be classified into two basic categories: thermoplastic polymers[3] or thermal curable materials[4, 5] for thermal-NIL, and UV-curable monomers or oligomers for UV-NIL[6 – 9]. The most commonly used NIL resists in earlier years were thermal plastic polymers, which required high pressure and high temperature so that the mold can be pressed into the <b>molten</b> resist <b>film.</b> Curing of thermal curable resists, although it requires lower pressure, is a time-consuming process due to the low speed of thermal-initiated polymerizations. Recently, UV-NIL has been developed for device fabrication, and it allows for imprinting at a low pressure and room temperature[6, 10, 11]. The process involves pressing a transparent mold into a low viscous photo-curable liquid thin film on a substrate and then solidifying the liquid materials via a UV light irradiation. The liquid resist can automatically fill the recess portions of the features on the mold due to capillary effect. An ideal UV resist usually has low viscosity, low surface tension, good adhesion to the substrate, fast cross-linking speed, high mechanical strength, and high etching resistance after cross-linking.|$|R

A large part of this thesis is devoted to the investigation of the surface and interfacial dynamics of supported single layer polystyrene and bilayer polystyrene/poly(4 -bromo styrene) films using x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS), a recently developed time-resolved coherent scattering technique on high-brilliance third-generation synchrotron radiation facilities. The static properties, such as thickness, surface tension, and interfacial width, can be obtained by conventional reflectivity and static diffuse scattering experiments.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} evolution of pulsed laser-irradiated, <b>molten</b> metallic <b>films</b> has been developed using the lubrication theory. The heat transfer problem that incorporates the absorbed heat from a single laser beam or the interfering laser beams is solved analytically. Using this temperature field, we derive the 3 D long-wave evolution PDE for the film height. To get insights into dynamics of dewetting, we study the 2 D version of the evolution equation by means of a linear stability analysis and by numerical simulations. The stabilizing and destabilizing effects of various system parameters, such as the reflectivity, the peak laser beam intensity, the film optical thickness, the Biot and Marangoni numbers, etc. are elucidated. It is observed that the film stability is promoted for such parameters variations that increase the heat production in the film. Moreover, when the heat conduction in the thin substrate is taken into account, the film with non-zero reflectivity is stable with respect to small perturbations in some interval of the optical thickness parameter. In the numerical simulations the impacts of different irradiation modes are investigated. In particular, we obtain that in the interference heating mode the spatially periodic irradiation results in a spatially periodic film rupture with the same, or nearly equal period. Small values of the capillary number result in ring rupture. The 2 D model qualitatively reproduces the experimental observations to-date and displays some new effects (Phys. Rev.

Numer. Meth. Fluids, 78, 436 – 454. doi: 10. 1002 /fld. 4024, which has been published in final form at [URL] audienceThe polymer cast film process consists of stretching a <b>molten</b> polymer <b>film</b> between a flat die and a drawing roll. Drawing instabilities are often encountered and represent a drastic limitation to the process. Newtonian fluid film stretching stability is investigated using two numerical strategies. The first one is a ‘tracking’ method, which consists of solving Stokes equations in the whole fluid area (extrusion die and stretching path) by finite elements. The interface is determined to satisfy a kinematic equation. A domain decomposition meshing technique is used in order to account for a flow singularity resulting from {{the change in the}} boundary conditions between the die flow region and the stretching path region. A linear stability method is then applied to this transient kinematic equation in order to investigate the stability of the stationary solution. The second method is a direct finite element simulation in an extended area including the fluid and the surrounding air. The time-dependent interface is captured by solving an appropriate level-set function. The agreement between the two methods is fair. The influence of the stretching parameters (Draw ratio and drawing length) is investigated. For a long stretching distance, a critical Draw ratio around 20 delimitating stable and unstable drawing conditions is obtained, and this agrees well with the standard membrane models, which have been developed 40 [*]years ago. When decreasing the stretching distance, the membrane model is no longer valid. The 2 D models presented here point out a significant increase of the critical Draw ratio, and this is consistent with experimental results...|$|R

Interestingly, PVDF-CTFE films with both alpha and beta type crystals gave rise to relatively high remnant polarization of approximately 4 mu C/cm(2) in metal/ferroelectric/metal capacitors regardless of the composition of CTFE. The ferroelectric polarization of a PVDF-CTFE film independent of thermal processing history allowed a wide processing window and easy fabrication protocol, resulting in a nonvolatile ferroelectric field effect transistor memory which exhibited saturated hysteresis loops with the current ON/OFF ratio of approximately 10 (3) at +/- 60 V sweep and reliable data retention.

40|$|Three {{concepts}} of direct absorption receivers for {{concentrating solar power}} (CSP) systems are compared. They are characterized by advantages like simple design, high working temperatures and good storage possibilities leading to a potential reduction of the levelized electricity costs. The design of the first concept, the liquid film receiver, {{is based on a}} face-down cylindrical barrel, whose inner surface is cooled by a directly irradiated <b>molten</b> salt <b>film.</b> Detailed investigations regarding film stability and system management strategies reveal increased receiver efficiency by implementing a slow rotation and inclined receiver walls. The second concept resembles the first one, but instead of molten salt small ceramic particles are used as heat transfer medium. The solar radiation is directly absorbed by a falling particle curtain whereas appropriate recirculation strategies of the particles can lead to high receiver efficiencies for all load conditions. While the above described systems are suitable for the 50 to 400 MWth power range the third concept – also a particle receiver – can be applied in decentralized small-scale CSP plants ranging from 100 kWth to 1 MWth as well as in larger systems with up to 200 MWth. Due to centrifugal acceleration the particles are forced against the cylindrical receiver wall where they form a thin layer which is directly heated up by incoming radiation. The particle retention time and with it the mass flow can be adjusted to all load conditions by regulating the rotation speed. Heliostat field layout calculations for different design power levels were carried out comparing the annual performance and levelized cost of heat for a face-down receiver and a receiver with an optimized inclination angle. Only small differences between both concepts could be noticed. However, simplified assumptions regarding thermal receiver losses were made neglecting e. g. convection losses. Thus, in order to give reliable information about the thermal efficiency of the introduced concepts, computational models considering the main heat loss mechanisms are developed. The models are accompanied by experimental validation and support the numerical findings...|$|R
