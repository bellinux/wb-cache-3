50|$|The Corps of <b>Mounted</b> <b>Guides</b> {{was raised}} in Portugal, the 26 September 1808, to at as guides and ordelies to the British generals and their staff.|$|R
50|$|Initially the Corps {{only had}} a sergeant, a {{corporal}} and 18 troopers. It was commanded from 1808 to 1814 by Major (later LtCol) George Scovell, seconded from the Portuguese Quartermaster-General's Department. Wellington later mentioned that when he took command of the army in April 1809 he formed a Corps of Horsemen then he denominated the Corps of <b>Mounted</b> <b>Guides</b> which was placed {{under the command of}} an officer of the British Quartermaster-General's Department.|$|R

The bolt's guide rails are shaped downward to drive the locking lever into engagement with the locking shoulder, which is also riveted to the side plates. The rear of the receiver has been reinforced and slotted to accept the butt-stock.|$|R

In the 1812-1814 campaigns the Corps of <b>Mounted</b> <b>Guides</b> was increasingly tasked with transmission of despatches, and also became more involved in provost duties. This corps is somewhat hard to classify as it was not listed on the official establishment of either the Portuguese Army or the official establishment of the British Army.

50|$|Differences in the Japanese {{block to}} Mexican are also present. The Mexico blocks (all DEs except {{those found in}} the S series) {{implemented}} a distributor and oil pump drive similar to the L series; from the crank nose.

The crank rides on individually capped bearings with a slightly smaller diameter than the Japanese block, with shorter, slightly lower compression pistons in cylinders that have thicker walls than the Japanese DE.

40|$|Abstract—The {{new concept}} of two–dimensional (2 D) image {{processing}} implementation for auto-guiding system {{is shown in}} this paper. It is dedicated to astrophotography and operates with astronomy CCD guide cameras or with self-guided dual-detector CCD cameras and ST 4 compatible equatorial mounts. This idea was verified by MATLAB model, which {{was used to test}} all procedures and data conversions. Next the circuit prototype was implemented at Altera MAX II CPLD device and tested for real astronomical object images. The digital processing speed of CPLD prototype board was sufficient for correct equatorial <b>mount</b> <b>guiding</b> in real-time system.

50|$|On July 17, 2010, the Houthis warned {{on their}} website that the {{government}} was preparing for another offensive against the Houthis. They said the government had been digging trenches from the Sana'a to Sa'ada. They claimed the army was trying to amass servicemen in villages and that soldiers in Amshia Bsfian region were creating an army stronghold on <b>Mount</b> <b>Guide.</b> The report came as the Yemeni government blamed Houthi fighters for recent ethnic clashes which had killed 11 people, including two soldiers, and for the kidnapping of two people in a market. The Houthis have denied these allegations and have claimed that it was the work of the government.|$|R
5000|$|A rather unusual {{feature of}} Outwars {{is that the}} legs and the torso can be {{controlled}} separately. This extra function can however be disabled by reconfiguring the controls. Furthermore, as in many shooters, the player can switch between a variety of weapons. Outwars accomplishes this feature in {{a departure from the}} norm; it is possible to map each of the weapons available to the player to individual keys on the keyboard or joystick. This enables players to fire weapons concurrently rather than consecutively as in a traditional shooter. (For example, the shoulder <b>mounted</b> <b>guided</b> missiles, hand-held pulse rifle, and remote-detonation mine can all be fired at the same time.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Standard {{armament}} {{consists of}} two remote-controlled Mk 38 Mod 2 25 mm chain guns and six crewed M2 [...]50 caliber machine guns. Depending on mission needs, gun mounts can hold M240 machine guns, M134 miniguns, and Mk 19 grenade launchers. The Mark VI is equipped with the MK50 Gun Weapon System (GWS), a shipboard version of the vehicle-mounted M153 CROWS remote turret that enables crewmen to use its camera and gun from the operator's station below deck. It is also planned to <b>mount</b> <b>guided</b> missiles such as the BGM-176B Griffin. Armor plating, able to withstand small-arms fire, is around key elements such as the engines and fuel tank.|$|R

5000|$|The main gun {{armament}} {{was five}} dual-purpose 5 inch/38 caliber (127 mm) guns in single <b>mounts,</b> <b>guided</b> by a Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System, including a Mk 12 fire control radar and a Mk 22 height-finder (both {{replaced by the}} circular Mk 25 radar postwar) linked by a Mark 1A Fire Control Computer and stabilized by a Mk 6 8,500 rpm gyro. Ten 21 in torpedo tubes were fitted in two quintuple centerline mounts, firing the Mark 15 torpedo. Initial designed anti-aircraft armament was a quadruple 1.1"/75 caliber gun mount and six [...]50 caliber machine guns; however, as the attack on Pearl Harbor had shown the need for increased light AA weapons, later ships were typically fitted with two twin 40 mm Bofors mounts plus seven single 20 mm Oerlikon weapons. Anti-submarine armament was initially two depth charge racks at the stern, augmented by up to six K-gun depth charge throwers as the war progressed.|$|R

The MOF comprises a sodium vapor cell in a kilogauss-level magnetic field between crossed polarizers {{and has a}} very narrow transmission profile at the sodium D- 2 resonance of approximately 0. 008 nm. Our observations were made with the 1. 5 m Kuiper telescope on Mt. Bigelow, AZ, which has a separately <b>mounted</b> <b>guide</b> star laser projecting a circularly polarized single-frequency beam of approximately 6. 5 W at 589. 16 nm.

Measurements of the guide star were made {{on the morning of}} 2016 March 24 using an imaging camera focused on the beacon and looking through the full aperture of the telescope. The guide star flux was estimated at 1. 20 x 10 (6) photon/m(2) /s while at approximately 45 minutes after sunrise, the sky background through the MOF was 1100 photon/m(2) /s/arcsec(2).
