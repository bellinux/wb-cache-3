5|$|Nurkse {{emphasised}} that Keynesian theory shouldn't {{be applied}} to underdeveloped countries because they don't face a lack of effective demand {{in the way that}} developed countries do. Their problem is to do with a lack of real purchasing power due to low productivity levels. Thus, merely increasing the supply of <b>money</b> <b>will</b> not expand the market but will in fact cause inflationary pressure.|$|E

5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of <b>money</b> <b>will</b> only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} in Marysville fell through, ISC courted another site, this time south of Bremerton National Airport in Bremerton, WA just across Puget Sound from Seattle. Although like the Marysville {{proposal}} the proposal in Bremerton {{was to be}} partially funded with public money, the <b>money</b> <b>will</b> not come directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes, in a scheme {{similar to the one}} used to fund Kansas Speedway. Also like the Marysville proposal, the Bremerton track would be publicly owned and leased to ISC for three races per year. ISC's current proposal was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers and citizens, but the company has promised to present an improved offer for early 2007.|$|E

Riding on Ruben James 2, a gelding from Germany she had only known for ten months, she scored 73.650 percentage points. Two days later, on 4 September, she scored 79.000 in the Individual Freestyle Test (class Ia) which brought her a silver medal. Her wins brought her prizes of $50,000 (for her bronze medal) and $100,000 (silver) from the SNPC's Athletes Achievement Awards scheme, again leading to comments about the stark difference between the cash prizes that Olympic and Paralympic medallists receive. Twenty per cent of the prize <b>money</b> <b>will</b> {{be paid to the}} Singapore National Paralympic Council for training and development. For her achievements, Tan won The Straits Times newspaper's Star of the Month for September, and was conferred a Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Star) by the President on 11 November 2012.|$|E
5|$|Over £840 {{million in}} cash from more than 100 UK local {{authorities}} was invested in Icelandic banks. Representatives from each council met {{to try to persuade}} the Treasury to secure the money {{in the same way that}} customers' money in Icesave was fully guaranteed. Of all the local authorities, Kent County Council has the most money invested in Icelandic banks, currently £50 million. Transport for London, the organisation that operates and coordinates transport services within London, also has a large investment at £40 million. Local authorities were working under government advice to invest their money across many national and international banks as a way of spreading risk. Other UK organisations said to have invested heavily include police services and fire authorities, and even the Audit Commission. It is hoped that about one-third of the deposited <b>money</b> <b>will</b> be available fairly rapidly, corresponding to the liquid assets of the UK subsidiaries: liquidation of other assets, such as loans and offices, will take longer.|$|E
