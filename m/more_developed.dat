5|$|The red fox is {{considered}} a more specialised form of Vulpes than the Afghan, corsac and Bengal foxes {{in the direction of}} size and adaptation to carnivory; the skull displays much fewer neotenous traits than in other species, and its facial area is <b>more</b> <b>developed.</b> It is, however, not as adapted for a purely carnivorous diet as the Tibetan fox.|$|E

The lower reaches of the watershed are the most heavily urbanized, while the upper reaches are still largely rural. This has been the case as early 1893.

5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, in the <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> {{parts of the}} world, animals are often intensively managed; dairy cows may be kept in {{zero-grazing}} conditions with all their forage brought to them; beef cattle may be kept in high density feedlots; pigs may be housed in climate-controlled buildings and never go outdoors; poultry may be reared in barns and kept in cages as laying birds under lighting-controlled conditions. In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family run farms where livestock graze outside {{for much of the}} year, silage or hay is made to cover the times of year when the grass stops growing, and fertiliser, feed and other inputs are bought onto the farm from outside.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{working on}} Oblivion focused on {{providing}} a tighter storyline, with fewer filler quests and <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> characters. The developers {{sought to make}} information in the game world more accessible to players, making the game easier {{to pick up and}} play. Oblivion features improved AI (courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary Radiant AI), improved physics (courtesy of the Havok physics engine), and impressive graphics, taking advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines like high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the creation of Oblivions terrain, leading to landscapes that are more complex and realistic than those of past titles, with less of a drain on Bethesda's staff.|$|E

5|$|Hergé's {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been cited as far <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> than the central character, each imbued with strength of character and depth of personality, which has been {{compared with that of}} the characters of Charles Dickens. Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.|$|E
5|$|I-590 {{begins at}} a semi-directional T {{interchange}} with I-390 {{in the town}} of Brighton, a southern suburb of the city of Rochester. The route heads east from the junction, passing under South Clinton Avenue (which passes through the east half of the interchange but does not connect to either freeway) and traveling east through open fields to its first interchange (a diverging diamond interchange) at South Winton Road. Here, the surroundings rapidly change from fields to densely populated residential areas as it passes through a <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> section of Brighton. As it approaches NY31 (Monroe Avenue) at exit2, I-590 turns a full 90 degrees to the north. Past NY31, I-590 runs through the former Erie Canal and Rochester Subway bed.|$|E
5|$|In God Speaks, Meher Baba {{describes}} {{the journey of}} the soul from its original state of unconscious divinity to the ultimate attainment of conscious divinity. The whole journey is a journey of imagination, where the original indivisible state of God imagines becoming countless individualized souls which he likens to bubbles within an infinite ocean. Each soul, powered {{by the desire to}} become conscious, starts its journey in the most rudimentary form of consciousness. This limitation brings the need of a <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> form to advance it towards an increasingly conscious state. Consciousness grows in relation to the impressions each form is capable of gathering.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{availability}} {{and quality of}} health care is better in Antananarivo than elsewhere in Madagascar, although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> countries. One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical technicians and specialists are trained there. Neonatal and antenatal care is significantly better in Antananarivo than elsewhere on the island. Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, {{the high cost of}} health care places it beyond the reach of most residents of Antananarivo. Pharmaceuticals are imported, making them particularly unaffordable; traditional herbal medicines remain popular and are readily available in local markets frequented by most of the population.|$|E
5|$|In {{promoting}} the series, both Piper and Eccleston stressed Rose's heroic characteristics whilst Davies highlighted {{her down to}} earth qualities and quintessential Britishness. Critical reaction noted that the character was <b>more</b> <b>developed,</b> independent and equal to the Doctor than previous companions had been, whilst the character's overall role in the narrative {{of the first two}} series was praised. However, reaction to the character's 2008 return was more mixed. Piper won numerous awards for her portrayal of Rose—including two National Television Awards—and since her initial role in the series, the character has ranked highly in numerous 'best companion' polls. After leaving as a series regular, Piper experienced success in other high-profile roles as an actress which has been partly attributed to her performances in Doctor Who.|$|E

5|$|Males {{without them}} {{are known as}} unflanged males in {{contrast}} to the <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> flanged males. The transformation from unflanged to flanged can occur very quickly. Unflanged and flanged males have two different mating strategies. Flanged males attract oestrous females with their characteristic long calls. Those calls may also suppress development in younger males. Unflanged males wander widely in search of oestrous females and upon finding one, will force copulation on her. While both strategies are successful, females prefer to mate with flanged males and seek their company for protection against unflanged males. Resident males may form consortships with females that can last days, weeks or months after copulation.|$|E
5|$|Metroid II is an action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the protagonist Samus Aran on the fictional planet SR388. In this side-scroller, players advance through the game by using Samus' weapons to kill a fixed number of Metroid creatures. The player is given a detector that displays the number of Metroids remaining in the area. Once all the creatures are eliminated, an earthquake occurs and the planet's lava levels decrease, allowing Samus to travel deeper through its tunnels. The Metroid creatures are encountered in different evolution stages of their development cycle: original, Alpha, Gamma, Zeta and Omega. The <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> the organism is, the stronger its attack. Metroid II features save modules located around the planet, which allow players to save their progress and continue in another session.|$|E
