40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a router {{that uses a}} shared input queue and distributes traffic over multiple output ports. Though such an architecture {{is subject to the}} Head-of-the-Line (HOL) blocking problem, it is very attractive when the router supports both load balancing over alternate paths and QoS. Therefore, in this work, we consider per-flow (or destination) queueing which (1) eliminates the need to further consider per-flow queueing at the individual destination ports therefore avoids the HOL blocking problem and (2) achieves QoS. We model a single traffic class at a routing node as it passes through a single-shared-input and then assigned to two-output ports that lead to alternate paths to the same destination. We assume that the remainder of the network transit delay beyond the router are different for both paths. Therefore our routing policy reduces the end-to-end delay by favoring the faster path by assigning packets to the higher-delay path only if the input queue length exceeds a given threshold  . We generalize the model by permitting the output port that leads to the slower path to represent a <b>multichannel</b> <b>link</b> group (e. g., multiple parallel wavelengths on the same optical fiber). We model our system as a two-dimensional Markov chain and use matrix geometric techniques to solve for its stationary probabilities...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel class of Nash {{problems}} for Cognitive Radio (CR) networks composed of multiple primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) wherein each SU (player) competes against {{the others to}} maximize his own opportunistic throughput by choosing jointly the sensing duration, the detection thresholds, and the vector power allocation over a <b>multichannel</b> <b>link.</b> In addition to power budget constraints, several (deterministic or probabilistic) interference constraints can be accommodated in the proposed general formulation, such as constraints on the maximum individual/aggregate (probabilistic) interference tolerable from the PUs. To keep the optimization as decentralized as possible, global interference constraints, when present, are imposed via pricing; the prices are thus additional variables to be optimized. The resulting players' optimization problems are nonconvex and there are price clearance conditions associated with the nonconvex global interference constraints to be satisfied by the equilibria of the game, which make {{the analysis of the}} proposed game a challenging task; none of classical results in the game theory literature can be successfully applied. To deal with the nonconvexity of the game, we introduce a relaxed equilibrium concept, the Quasi-Nash Equilibrium (QNE), and study its main properties, performance, and connection with local Nash equilibria. Quite interestingly, the proposed game theoretical formulations yield a considerable performance improvement with respect to current centralized and decentralized designs of CR systems, which validates the concept of QNE.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} {{the application of}} constrained coding to 40 -Gb/s dispersion-managed single-channel optical communication systems limited by intrachannel four-wave mixing (IFWM). It is shown that when transmitted sequences obey the socalled (2, ∞) constraint, runlength-limited codes can be designed to not only suppress ghost pulse formation but also improve the data rate {{by as much as}} 50 % without increasing the transmission bandwidth. Since IFWM is a highly pattern-dependent effect, coding schemes with certain characteristics are preferable. Two different codes with simple encoding and decoding algorithms are constructed, and their performance is analyzed and compared to that of a realistic benchmark system. One of the codes turns out to be consistently better than the other due to its superior statistical properties. The qualitative conclusions are confirmed by numerical simulations. An extension of the method to <b>multichannel</b> <b>links</b> is also considered, and similar gain in data rate is demonstrated.

40|$|We {{study the}} utility of dynamic {{frequency}} agility in realworld wireless sensor networks. Many view such agility as essential to obtaining adequate reliability in industrial environments. We quantify the actual utility by identifying the two facets of connectivity graph that yield potential benefits called <b>Multichannel</b> <b>Links</b> (MCLs) and <b>Multichannel</b> Triangles (MCTs), study how frequently these occur empirically and determine whether multihop provides a comparable solution without the complexity of switching channels. We examine connectivity graphs of live networks over each 802. 15. 4 channel and find that MCLs and MCTs are extremely rare in practice. Almost no MCLs are found in any connectivity graph while MCTs occur between 0 - 200 parts per million (ppm). Furthermore, we show that MCLs are rarely important for routing while each MCT has a singlechannel routing solution. We also find that there are channels that are always good for connectivity and offer comparable routing costs, with respect to transmission count, in comparison to multichannel communication. Thus, the justification for channel agility in industrial environments applies in the absence {{but not in the}} presence of multihop routing...|$|R

A direct detected broadband <b>multichannel</b> SCM <b>link</b> composed of a state-of-the-art optical IQ modulator and five quadrature phase-shift keyed (QPSK) subcarriers per optical channel is presented, showing that a suppression ratio of 20 dB obtained directly with the modulator produced a penalty of 2 dB in overall performance, due to interference between adjacent optical channels...|$|R
40|$|Experiments are {{reported}} in which two channels are simultaneously amplified by an optical amplifier. The crosstalk is investigated. The experiments reveal nonlinear distortions in the amplification. The generated crosstalk may become a serious problem in <b>multichannel</b> transmission <b>links.</b> Semiconductor laser amplifiers are expected {{to play an important}} role in future communications. Recently several experiments on amplifiers with reduced facet reflectivity were reported. This amplifier type exhibits a smooth gain spectrum with a superimposed 'ripple' caused by the residual Fabry-Perot resonator. Its gain characteristic is strongly affected by the optical input signal, especially near saturation. For instance, an increase of the optical input signal reduces the carrier density in the active region by stimulated emission, and thus changes the complex refractive index. This affects the gain and shifts the residual Fabry-Perot modes towards longer wavelengths...|$|R
