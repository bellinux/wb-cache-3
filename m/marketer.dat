On the pace laps, Johnson, after changing his engine, and teammate Earnhardt, who had to move to a back-up car, had to fall behind all the other drivers in the event after doing major changes during practice. At the start, Newman was the leader going through the first corner, but on the same lap Menard, with pushing assistance from Martin, passed him. On the second lap, the first caution was given because Newman spun sideways in the second turn but avoided impacting the wall. During the caution, he drove to pit road for a pit stop.|$|E

40|$|Green {{marketing}} has {{an important}} role to play in supporting sustainable development. <b>Marketers</b> have a vital responsibility to communicate on relevant products and services, creating awareness on environmental issues among consumers. They could also play a role in promoting sustainable consumption. However, previous research has also suggested that, as yet, green marketing and indeed marketing’s broader influence on attitudes towards sustainability, are yet to be fully mobilised. Considering the important role of <b>marketers</b> in achieving sustainable development, this research focuses on <b>marketers</b> and studying what the attitude of <b>marketers</b> regarding sustainability and green marketing actually is. Additionally, given the extensive research on consumer markets, this research contributes to the less studied context of industrial business to business (B 2 B) marketing. Also, given the inadequate attention on green marketing in developing countries, this research focused on <b>marketers</b> from India and compared their attitudes with <b>marketers</b> from Australia, a developed country. The research used Q methodology, including Q sorts, Q analysis and interpretation, to elicit and analyse the attitudes and viewpoints of <b>marketers</b> towards sustainability and green marketing. The research revealed B 2 B <b>marketers</b> have three predominant attitudes towards green marketing – those who show an interest in green marketing and actively use it, those who show an interest in green marketing, but are unable to use it in practice and those who are not interested in green marketing. The findings revealed several constraints which prevent <b>marketers</b> from using green marketing. The findings also revealed various similarities attitudes of <b>marketers</b> from developing and developed countries, such as the existence of highly interested <b>marketers.</b> At the same time, some differences were also evident where <b>marketers</b> with altruistic values were found only from the developing country and was absent in the <b>marketers</b> from the developed countr...|$|R

However, no significant differences are found on the relativistic dimension of moral philosophy. Also, American <b>marketers</b> are found to have higher ethical perception than Middle-Eastern <b>marketers.</b> Finally, contrary to our hypothesized direction, some support is found to indicate that Middle-Eastern <b>marketers</b> are more likely to have higher corporate ethical values than American <b>marketers.</b> Implications of the findings are discussed.

5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{an update}} to the SEOC Act, the Child Protection Act of 1984, made {{it illegal to}} {{purchase}} pornographic materials depicting minors through the mail, or possess them, {{on the grounds that}} it encouraged child sexual abuse. While popular with voters, civil liberties advocates warned that the expanded scope of these laws could result in prosecutions of entirely innocent people who had little or nothing to do with the child-porn industry, such as parents taking photos or videos of their children in the nude. Nevertheless, investigators forged ahead and had, by the mid-1980s, shut down almost all domestic child-porn production.

As a result of James' endorsement money and NBA salary, he has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes. In 2013, he surpassed Kobe Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million. In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones. In 2015, he was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson, and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi).

The data was collected on a Likert-scale and was analysed using a quantitative methodology (descriptive statistics followed by Distribution Fitting Algorithm). The main finding of this research was that <b>marketers</b> are using the more traditional set of metrics such as sales, sales trends, market share and market trends. <b>Marketers</b> are not using the more advanced set of metrics such as brand equity, customer equity and customer lifetime value. Overall the findings indicated that <b>marketers</b> are not linking their activities to overall company performance. <b>Marketers</b> are aware of the benefits of measuring marketing performance but may lack the analytical skills required to utilise the more advanced metrics. <b>Marketers</b> need to link their activities to company performance {{in order to get the}} credibility they deserve in the boardroom.

40|$|Abstract: We review {{explanations}} for two controversial vertical restraints {{commonly used in}} gasoline marketing: price zones and territorial restrictions. After {{a discussion of the}} relevant empirical and theoretical economics literature, we consider procompetitive and anticompetitive theories behind the practices. Price zones may be one part of a complicated relationship between gasoline <b>marketers</b> and retailers that facilitates efficient risk-sharing, provides optimal incentives for <b>marketers</b> and retailers, and allows <b>marketers</b> to react more quickly to changes in localized retail competition. Alternatively, if gasoline <b>marketers</b> have substantial market power, price zones may facilitate coordination or help deter entry. Territorial restrictions may prevent inefficiencies in distribution and reduce free-riding on investments <b>marketers</b> make in developing networks of retail stations. At the same time, territorial restrictions help <b>marketers</b> maintain price zones (with the same welfare implications), and may, if <b>marketers</b> have substantial market power, facilitate coordination.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} the compliance of <b>marketers</b> of agrochemicals with the approved and banned cocoa pesticides in selected cocoa producing states of southwest Nigeria. Primary data was collected {{through the use of}} structured questionnaire administered to randomly selected agrochemical <b>marketers.</b> All the <b>marketers</b> (100 %) were aware of the recently banned cocoa pesticides, however, majority still have the pesticides in stock. About 70. 6 % of the <b>marketers</b> in Osun state and 58. 8 % in Ogun state stated that they did not receive information on the banned pesticides from government agencies but through other channels. More than half of the <b>marketers</b> (52. 9 % in Ogun, 55 % in Kwara and 47. 1 % in Osun) strongly disagreed that government should place a ban on pesticides. Availability of banned pesticides in their stock, insufficient information from the concerned government agricultural agencies, and fear of short supply of approved pesticides are among the reasons proffered by the <b>marketers</b> for not supporting the ban of pesticides. Relevant government regulatory agencies should conduct a comprehensive inventory of pesticides offered for sale by the <b>marketers</b> of agrochemicals. There should be massive public awareness programme, and well-coordinated association for all the <b>marketers</b> of agrochemicals.
