40|$|Improved {{permanent}} magnets {{are essential for}} emergent applications in electronic and electric devices. Different {{attempts have been made}} to produce nanoscale anisotropic rare-earth magnetic powder based on Nd-Fe-B material. Recently, high energy surfactant assisted ball milling has been proven to be an effective technique to produce anisotropic hard magnetic Nd-Fe-B nanoparticles. In this paper we are presenting our experimental results on high energy ball milling in planetary mill "Puverisette 7 premium line" from "Fritsch". Except milling material, there are several variables which influence the milling process for the selected mill type. They are: mechanical properties of the milling media material (bowls, balls, etc.), ball-to-powder ratio (BPR), extent of filling of the <b>milling</b> <b>bowl,</b> milling atmosphere, milling speed and duration, and type of solution and surfactant for wet milling. We are going to give influence of all these parameters on obtained NdFeB magnetic materials with nanosized dimensions starting from Nd 2 Fe 14 B HDD (Hydrogenated Disproportionated Desorbed) material.

30|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to extend the possibilities of the above-mentioned NCM production method owing {{to the use of}} a planetary-type ball mill for production of precursors. Another {{objective of}} this study is analysis of nanocomposite structure formation mechanisms and influence of the structure features on the physicomechanical properties of the produced materials. We have chosen to employ such a mill for obtainment of precursors because powder grains are not only ground in the mixing process of the composite components in the mill but also their physicochemical characteristics become altered as well. When powders are treated in the mill, particles of the material being ground collide multiple times with other particles, with the grinding balls and the walls of the <b>mill’s</b> <b>bowls.</b> The particles become mechanically activated, their reactivity is raised and even poorly soluble components become mutually mechanically alloyed owing to these collisions at high acceleration values of the bowls. Effectiveness of treatment of powders in such mills depends on a number of performance characteristics of these mills. These include, in the first place, power of a mill, design features, etc. Some authors [3, 4] believe that effectiveness of a mill operation is mainly determined by absolute particle production rates, while others assign primary importance to other technical characteristics: volume of the bowl, diameter of the grinding balls, material of the balls, spinning rates of the drum plate and the <b>mill’s</b> <b>bowl,</b> ratio of those rates, etc. It is evident that all these characteristics are directly linked to the accelerations (g) affecting the material in the <b>mill’s</b> <b>bowls</b> and this is the parameter that needs {{to be taken into account}} in solving the assigned tasks. The value of g does not exceed 20 g for commonly used mills. In this situation, the material needs to undergo many hours of treatment to achieve an effect on the material being ground [5 – 8]. In our study, the planetary mill used to produce the precursors is capable of acceleration up to 50 g. This has enabled us to reduce the time needed for treatment of the powders and to improve its effectiveness for achievement of high physicomechanical properties of NCM.|$|R
40|$|Pulverised coal {{preparation}} system (Coal mills) {{is the heart}} of coal-fired power plants. The complex nature of a milling process, together with the complex interactions between coal quality and mill conditions, would lead to immense difficulties for obtaining an effective mathematical model of the milling process. In this paper, vertical spindle coal <b>mills</b> (<b>bowl</b> <b>mill)</b> that are widely used in coal-fired power plants, is considered for the model development and its pulverised fuel flow rate is computed using the model. For the steady state coal mill model development, plant measurements such as air-flow rate, differential pressure across mill etc., are considered as inputs/outputs. The mathematical model is derived from analysis of energy, heat and mass balances. An Evolutionary computation technique is adopted to identify the unknown model parameters using on-line plant data. Validation results indicate that this model is accurate enough to represent the whole process of steady state coal mill dynamics. This coal mill model is being implemented on-line in a 210 MW thermal power plant and the results obtained are compared with plant data. The model is found accurate and robust that will work better in power plants for system monitoring. Therefore, the model can be used for online monitoring, fault detection, and control to improve the efficiency of combustion. ...|$|R

30|$|In Pulverized {{fuel boiler}} system, {{powdered}} coal {{is used for}} combustion, out of which 2 % is nearly of +  30 microns size and 70 – 75 % is below 75 microns. A different variety of coal {{can be used in}} these types of boilers. In pulverized boilers, coal is reduced to a fine powder with the help of grinding mills and projected into combustion chamber with the help of hot air current. Pre-heated air from PA fan helps the coal to flow from the <b>bowl</b> <b>mill</b> to the boiler. A fire ball is created when the coal is fired inside the furnace where the temperature rises up to 1300 – 1700  °C. About 90 % of the coal power plants use these types of boilers for power generation [4, 23]. Small proportion of wood, biomass and agricultural materials can also be used as fuel in pulverized fuel boilers [24].|$|R
50|$|Currently, a lot {{of waste}} ends up in {{incineration}} plants or is dumped to landfill. Depending on the region, waste collection systems have advanced to separate collections for recycling, which allows easier production of refuse-derived fuel. The technology consists {{of a number of}} different treatment stages, depending on the input waste streams. The waste streams are typically purified, with recyclables being collected and sorted out of the waste streams. The waste is dried if necessary. The material is shredded to the required size and turned into , with a diameter of approximately 8mm. Terms of calorific value, ash content, chlorine contact and moisture content are important to rate the quality of the pellets. The calorific value is comparable with (and sometimes higher than) a few types of coal. The percentage of biomass is fairly high as well; it is more than 50%. Because it is in pellets, Subcoal shows hydrophobic behaviour and does not dissolve when the moisture content is increased, which is important when considering external storage. Subcoal is mostly dosed as a ground (pulverized) fuel. Subcoal is commercially used via various grinding media (direct firing); via a hammer mill (12 tonnes per hour), air-rotor mill (6 tonnes per hour) and via a <b>bowl</b> <b>mill</b> (4 tonnes per hour). Cement manufacturers, lime producers and energy providers spray the Subcoal powder with coal powder into their kilns.|$|R

He finished the 2013/14 domestic Sheffield Shield season as the leading wicket taker for the NSW Blues, just edging out Western Australia's Jason Behrendorff. He was picked on the 2014 tour of the UAE to play Pakistan. Kerry O'Keefe (no relation) said at the time:It is a reward for some of the stuff he has done over the past two years. His numbers are undeniable so they obviously misread him somehow. They have been forced to pick him as he has kept putting them in the book...

50|$|Major {{equipment}} like boiler, turbine, auxiliaries like BFP, CEP, PA fans, <b>bowl</b> <b>mills</b> etc. were {{supplied by}} BHEL. In coal handling plant, major equipment like {{primary and secondary}} crusher were supplied by TRF and wagon tippler was supplied by Heavy Engineering Corporation (HEC). Since commissioning none of the unit could deliver the desired level of generation for various reasons. Some {{of the main reasons}} were problem in the boiler, turbine, mill and other unit auxiliaries and also in the coal handling plant. During July 2002, the plant was running at a very low PLF of 4.6%, very high auxiliary power consumption of 22.68% very high specific oil consumption of 59.12 ml/kwhr and height specific coal consumption of 0.85 kg/kwhr with a coal of GCV 3500 Kcal/kg. None of the units could deliver the required level of generation and the maximum PLF of the plant in the last twenty years of operation has been only 24.23%. As a result, the station had to be shut down. It had been found that although it was technically feasible to renovate the existing units of BTPS, {{it would not have been}} economically viable as the tariff works out to about Rs 3.16 per unit after carrying out R&M at an estimated cost of about Rs 7 billion. Hence, capital grant/viability gap funding of Rs 3.5 billion would have to be provided to bring down the tariff to an acceptable level of Rs 2.50 per unit. The alternative is NTPC's proposal to set up a new 750 MW (3 X 250 MW) Thermal Power Station at the same location, at a total project cost of approximately Rs Rs 44.9624 billion based on third quarter 2006 price level. The power station would be based on Fuel Gas Desulphurization (FGD) technology due to high sulphur content of Assam coal, involving additional cost of Rs 0.5 crores/MW approximately.|$|R
