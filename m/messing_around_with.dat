500|$|According to Coldplay drummer Will Champion in a fan mailout, [...] "Lost!" [...] {{had been}} {{developed}} long before the band began recording tracks for their fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, and was not getting into completion. Champion recalls, [...] "I {{was starting to get}} into using a particular drum programming programme. I was <b>messing</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> that and I built this beat up from scratch.... Then Chris overheard it and played 'Lost!' over the top of it." [...] Martin revealed that the song's drumbeat took inspiration from Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", which was one of Champion's favourite songs at that time.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{were written}} with Hoppus and DeLonge going into {{separate}} rooms—Hoppus writing the choruses and DeLonge writing the verses. The two {{had not spoken}} {{to each other about}} the lyrics ahead of time, {{and it turned out that}} the two had both written about sex. When put together, the song represents the lustful side of sex during the verses, the passionate side in the bridge and the romantic side in the chorus, creating a juxtaposition between both voices. It has been interpreted as a description for failed romance, one that [...] "illustrates a scenario of lust, ambivalence and regret." [...] For Barker, the song's drum track was [...] "super in respect to John Bonham. [...] We were kind of <b>messing</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> the verse. It’s like, 'Well, I want to do a four-bar drum intro and just see how it works for the song.' And we never second-guessed it. We were like, 'That sounds rad.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been <b>messing</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Wild Night", {{a hybrid of}} R, soul and country music influences, which {{utilizes}} a moderate 4/4 time signature and features the lead guitar playing of Ronnie Montrose. The song's intro was created, according to Montrose, [...] when [...] "One afternoon I was <b>messing</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> {{what is now the}} intro on the record, [...] stopped me and ... said ' ... that thing you just played ... that's the intro, don't forget it'". This guitar driven intro in Clinton Heylin's opinion made it one of Morrison's most memorable singles. [...] "Wild Night", which has been described by biographer Ken Brooks as [...] "a great start to the album", was first recorded after the Astral Weeks sessions in Autumn 1968 and was re-recorded numerous times before its eventual release on Tupelo Honey. Morrison recalled during an interview that the song was originally [...] "a much slower number, but when we got to fooling around with it in the studio, we ended up doing it in a faster tempo." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pour Me", {{the last}} soft {{song on the}} album, is a dark ballad that has been often {{compared}} to Eminem's [...] "Stan". Johnny3Tears stated that, [...] "We were <b>messing</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> chord progressions and that came out like a more major chord style than we were used to it. It's melodic and poppy sounding. We're talking about drinking obviously because all of us sometimes drink too much. It's one of those basic every day things that people go through but they don't know how to voice it or others around them don't know to voice it. It's almost like you're looked down upon, but no one actually talks about it." [...] "Tendencies", which is the closing track for the standard edition of the album, is a high tempo alternative metal song about murder. Johnny3Tears said, [...] "When we wrote Tendencies, I {{wanted to make a}} song that kids would just go nuts to when we played it. Kids start moshpits at our shows. Not every song we have is the best mosh song, so I wanted to make a song kids could go crazy for." ...|$|E

2500|$|A rematch {{between the}} two fighters was {{described}} (in 2009) as being [...] "much anticipated", but has failed to eventuate.

I don't want to be <b>messing</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> no contenders." [...] The rivalry continued into 2012 with Green stating: [...] "He won the fight on the night but since then he's avoided the immediate rematch clause" [...] and [...] "Most people in Australia know that that victory is pretty shallow, as far as him fighting a dehydrated, starving ghost" [...] (referring to the considerable weight drop Green undertook for the fight with Mundine).|$|E
2500|$|... "Just My Imagination" [...] was {{the result}} of {{one of the few times}} that Whitfield relented and {{produced}} a ballad as a single for the group. Whitfield and Strong wrote the song in 1969, but with the Temptations' psychedelic soul singles consistently keeping them in the US Top 20, Whitfield and Strong decided to shelve the composition and wait for the right time to record it. In late 1970, the Temptations' single [...] "Ungena Za Ulimwengu (Unite the World)", a psychedelic soul song about world peace, failed to reach the Top 30, and Whitfield decided to record and release [...] "Just My Imagination" [...] as the next single. He approached Barrett Strong, and asked him to pull out [...] "that song we were <b>messing</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> a year ago... because I'm going to record it today." [...] Except their late 1960s duets with Diana Ross & the Supremes, the Temptations had not released a single that was not based in psychedelia since [...] "Please Return Your Love to Me" [...] from The Temptations Wish It Would Rain in 1968.|$|E
2500|$|The witness {{tampering}} {{charges were}} based on text messages Ravi sent to Wei, in which he tried to persuade her not to contradict what he had told police.

[...] Wei responded [...] "Omg dharun why didnt u talk to me first i told them everything". According to a prosecution expert witness, Ravi deleted almost 100 text messages between him and Wei and another high school friend, whom he had invited to view Clementi's second encounter with his guest. A key aspect of the prosecution's evidence tampering charge was Ravi's deletion of two potentially incriminating postings: one on Twitter on September 19 in which he wrote that his roommate was [...] "making out with a dude. Yay", and one on September 21 in which he told his iChat followers [...] "dare you to video chat me" [...] {{during the time of}} Clementi's tryst. He replaced the latter post with one that said [...] "don't you dare video chat me" [...] {{at the time of the}} tryst, stating that the first message was a draft.

A year after they broke up, the girl started dating another guy, much to Pugh's annoyance. It [...] "just ate at me so hard" [...] and as a result Pugh wrote [...] "Honestly". While the band were working on [...] "Honestly" [...] Pugh thought that [...] "it just wasn't quite sounding right" [...] and instead lifed the vocal track from the demo on to the album version. [...] "It matched up perfectly, which was sweet!" [...] explained Pugh. [...] "Burn This City" [...] is about the band getting out of town and having other people telling them they couldn't. [...] "Save Us" [...] was the first piano song Pugh wrote. The melody for the song came from Pugh <b>messing</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> a piano at Pepper's house.

2500|$|A {{majority}} of the band's previous material was written by former guitarist Ryan Ross. For Vices & Virtues, Urie had [...] "to step up and take the reins lyrically," [...] which he regarded as having not much experience in prior. The biggest inspiration for lyricism was keeping busy and going out, instead of locking themselves in and writing. Urie has regarded the lyrics as very honest and straightforward, as well as very fantastical with elements of storytelling. Urie explained [...] "We were so self-conscious about everything, hyper-aware of what we’re doing, that when we’re writing I go, [...] "Okay, I don’t {{want this to be}} Barry Manilow’s [...] "Mandy", but I want it to be as romantic and cute ...’ There’s a lot of that fighting within yourself. But it ended up being great, and I’m glad {{that we were able to}} figure out what we wanted to write about." [...] The lyrics also reflect the confusion after the departure of Ross and Walker. The sessions with Feldmann at his home studio led to experimentation with new sounds. [...] "We really loved Paul Simon and got into using marimbas and string instruments," [...] explains Urie. [...] "We ended up buying some synths and <b>messing</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> them. It was two kids in a candy store… and we listened to Arcade Fire's The Suburbs on repeat for me for the past… well, since it came out [...]" ...|$|E
