We also propose a simpler SIRoptimized Group LPIC scheme where the interfering users are ordered based on their SIRs and the strongest (in terms of SIR) among them are cancelled; {{the number of such}} strongest users to cancel is determined by optimizing the corresponding SIR expression. We show that the proposed SIR-optimized Group LPIC schemes perform better than the conventional LPIC scheme (where all the interfering users are cancelled) as well as the matched filter (MF) detector (where none of the interfering users are cancelled), under near-far as well as non-near-far scenarios.

Germans succeeded in driving the Ottomans. When the war spread with the Ottoman Empire’s entry into the war, Germany took a breath in Europe. Thanks to the newly emerging fronts Ottoman forces drew many Russian and British Colonial divisions on its own divisions. Accumulation of the British divisions in Egypt; reinforcement of fronts emerged in Gallipoli, Palestine and Iraq; and opening a second front to Russia was by courtesy of the Ottomans. This was providing strategic advantage to the Germans. And the Entente powers saw German defeat completing the containment after the Ottoman Empire out of war.

40|$|Abstract. Using a {{calculus}} {{of variations}} approach, we determine {{the shape of a}} typical plane partition in a large box (i. e., a plane partition chosen at random according to the uniform distribution on all plane partitions whose solid Young diagrams fit inside the box). Equivalently, we describe the distribution of the three different orientations of lozenges in a random lozenge tiling of a large hexagon. We prove a generalization of the classical formula of MacMahon for the number of plane partitions in a box; for each of the possible ways in which the tilings of a region can behave when restricted to certain lines, our formula tells the number of tilings that behave in that way. When we take a suitable limit, this formula gives us a functional which we must <b>maximize</b> <b>to</b> determine the asymptotic behavior of a plane partition in a box. Once the variational problem has been set up, we analyze it using a modification of the methods employed by Logan and Shepp and by Vershik and Kerov in their studies o...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} an MIMO {{precoding}} and postcoding transceiver to achieve data secrecy at the physical layer. When full channel state information (CSI) of the legitimate receiver {{is known to}} the transmitter, the proposed precoder can simultaneously <b>maximize</b> <b>to</b> receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and attain secrecy. When only partial CSI is available, a modified Lloyd algorithm is proposed to construct codebooks for quantizing the precoder. As will be explained in this paper, {{the use of the}} proposed codebooks does not affect the secrecy of the proposed system. In addition, we propose a low-complexity postcoder to compensate the SNR loss when full CSI is not available. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed system is analyzed from the view points of both recovery rate and secrecy. Based on the analyzed results, we show how to achieve full recovery rate and perfect secrecy for the proposed system. Finally, simulation results corroborate the theoretical results, and show that the proposed system enjoys different advantages when different recovery algorithms are used.

40|$|Divide and {{recombine}} (D 2 ̆ 6 R) is {{a statistical}} {{framework for the}} analysis of large complex data. The data are divided into subsets. Numeric and visualization methods, which collectively are analytic methods, are applied to each subset. For each analytic method, the outputs of the application of the method to the subsets are recombined. So each analytic method has associated with it a division method and a recombination method. Here we study D 2 ̆ 6 R methods for likelihood-based model fitting. We introduce a notion of likelihood analysis and modeling. We divide the data and fit a likelihood model on each subset. The fitted model is characterized by a set of parameters much smaller than the subset data size, but retains as much information as possible about the true subset likelihood. Analysis of subset likelihoods and their fitted models consists of visualizations on an appropriate scale and region. These visualizations allow the analyst to verify the choice and fit of the model. The fitted models are recombined across subsets to form a model of the the all-data likelihood, which we <b>maximize</b> <b>to</b> obtain a likelihood modeling estimate (LME).
