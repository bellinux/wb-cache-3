50|$|The first Chevrolet {{engine to}} use 4-bolt mains was the 1967 Chevrolet Camaro. Chrysler and Ford {{employed}} Y-blocks, {{meaning that the}} block skirts extended below the centreline of the crankshaft. The main bearing caps could then be fixed with an additional cross-bolt, which was a horizontal bolt going into or through the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mark IV engines saw {{extensive}} {{application in}} Chevrolet and GMC medium duty trucks, {{as well as}} in Blue Bird Corporation's All American and TC/2000 transit buses (the latter up until 1995, using a 427 with purpose-built carburetor). In addition to the 427, a 366-cubic-inch (6.0 L) version was produced for the commercial market. Both the 366 and 427 commercial versions were built with a raised-deck, four-bolt <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> cylinder to accommodate an extra oil control ring on the pistons. Unfortunately, the raised deck design complicated the use of the block in racing applications, as standard intake manifolds required spacers for proper fit. Distributors with adjustable collars that allowed adjustments to the length of the distributor shaft also had to be used with 366 and 427 truck blocks.|$|E

50|$|A 4-bolt main {{refers to}} the number of bolts {{attaching}} the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> to the block of an internal combustion engine. Four bolt mains are considered much stronger for high performance use than a 2 bolt main. Using 4 bolts to secure the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> reduces the amount of flex within the crankshaft as compared to 2 bolts.|$|R
50|$|The balance shafts are {{relocated}} {{from the}} cylinder block to oil pan module. The two-piece steel-aluminum oil pan features in-pan integrated oil-pump assembly {{driven by the}} balance shaft with a shorter inverted-tooth chain. Other improvements include inverted-tooth chain driving the camshaft, forged steel crankshaft, cast aluminum bedplate with <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> inserts made of iron, high-pressure fuel rail with rubber-isolated assembly, acoustically shielded plastic cover for the intake manifold, and structurally enhanced aluminum camshaft cover and front cover. These improvements helped reduce noise intensity by 40% compared to the 2.4 L engine and change the noise signature into a higher frequency above 2,000 Hz. The engine also uses a variable-displacement oil pump and an actively controlled thermostat. Direct injection reduces emissions by 25%, while continuous cam phasing {{eliminates the need for}} an EGR system. Maximum engine speed is listed at 7000 RPM.|$|E
50|$|The VG {{engine family}} {{consists}} of V6 piston engines designed and produced by Nissan for several {{vehicles in the}} Nissan lineup. The VG series started in 1983 becoming Japan's first mass-produced V6 engine. VG engines displace between 2.0 L and 3.3 L and feature an iron block and aluminum heads. The early VG engines featured a SOHC arrangement with 2 valves per cylinder. A later revision featured a slightly different block, and a DOHC arrangement which utilized 4 valves per cylinder and Nissan's own version of variable valve timing for a smoother idle and more torque at low to medium engine speeds. The block features a single piece <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>cap.</b> The production blocks and production head castings were used successfully in the Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo and NPT-90 race cars which won the IMSA GT Championship {{three years in a}} row.|$|E
40|$|The {{studies on}} the cause of fault at machine {{elements}} and materials have been explained by many authors already. But, the studies of actual machine parts {{under the influence of}} dynamic load are rare explained. Here the studies of breakage in main bearing siud at diesel engine are achieved and its solutlhn is proved. The results are summarized as follows: 1. The insufficient rigidity of engine bed is most cause of breakage in main bearing studs at diesel engine. 2. Seconrlly, the main bearing stud suffered severe load by the weak structure of <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> and therfore the better type of structure is recommended by the writer. 3. Tightness of main bearing is important too. The maximum tensile stress of main bearing studis about 2 times in comparison with one of the other studby fault of tighting and its value indicates about 28 kg/㎟. ディーゼル機関に於て主軸受スタッドの切損を屡々見受ける。この切損の特徴として，その装着位置からして早期発見が仲々むつかしく従って慨事故を発見した時は主軸受メタルの焼付・亀裂又はクランクジャーナル部の偏摩粍等を併発している事が多く，甚だしきに至っては機関台床亀裂等の大事故を起し機関再選転を不能ならしめた例もある。筆者の過去数年間に互る調査結果より推察すると，概切損事故の特色は機関主軸受NO・としてクランク両・端側の主軸受（例えば 7 シリンダ機関ではNO・ 1 及 8 主軸受）には事故皆無であり，切損の過半数は中央主軸受（ 7 シリンダ機関ではNO・ 4 及 5 主軸受）に発生している事である。尚スタッドの切損個所としてはスタッド植込部からが殆んどである。此等の調査結果を本稿中の表- 1 に示してある。主軸受スタッド切損に就て調査研究並びにこれに基ずく実験を行い，その原因を究明し得たのでその対策と併せて茲に発表する...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis was {{performed}} at Scania CV AB in Södertälje at the engine development department, NMKA and at Scania Latin America in Sao Paolo, Brazil. Scania {{is a global}} company with operations in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Australia. Scania is the world’s third largest manufacturer for heavy trucks and heavy bus segment. The constant development of new design solutions demands more stable mounting in Scanias production. Assemblies with new screw joints with different parameters affect {{the value of the}} clamping force for the joint and consequently the final product. It is critical that the screw joint has the right clamping force to assure that it fulfils its purpose. Large deviations can result in total loss of clamping force and engine breakdown. The purpose with this master thesis was to find the most important factors that affect the clamping force and form the basis of how different screw joints should be handled. Knowledge about Scania screw joints were collected by working in the production, observing drawings, a thorough literature study and by interviewing representatives from different departments. The problems regarding screw joints were found to be rather different at the departments and the problems had been an issue {{for a longer period of}} time. The mapping of screw joints resulted in a number of interesting screw joints with different kinds of problems. A discussion about the interesting screw joints was held in order to select joints to take a closer look at. By focusing on area of interest, area of responsibility and resources, five screw joints were selected, rocker arm shaft, <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>cap,</b> connecting rod and the oil sump in both aluminum and steel. The chosen screw joints represented specific types of screw joints on which the chosen parameters were tested. The important parameters that were tested are driver speed, friction and settlement. The equipment that was used throughout the work was the Ultrasonic, which measures the length of a screw with ultrasound. The authors feel that the equipment has given reliable results and that it has been easy and convenient to use during the tests since time consuming strain gages were avoided. The test results shows that the speed of the nut runner has a great influence on the clamping force and torque. Depending on the nut runner and which kind of screw joint that is examined the clamping force and torque varies. The friction affects the result of the tightening substantially, especially when tightening by torque. If torque and angle tightening is used it is an advantage to keep the initial torque as low as possible but high enough to keep the surfaces tight together before applying the angle. The test results regarding settlement show that the settlement is extremely dependent on the ingoing parts in the screw joint. Parameters such as screw and clamped parts affect both the tightening procedure and degree of settlement. The authors recommendations are that a decision has to be made about what information is important for each department. Furthermore, as the tightening procedure is really important for the final clamping force it is advisable to decide which department that is responsible of making the correct tightening parameters of a specific screw joint in the production. Hopefully this master thesis has woken an interest which in the future can make a difference for an even more stable production and in the end an even better quality at Scania CV AB.

There were also many differences between the racing Hemi's and the street Hemi, including {{but not limited to}} compression ratio, camshaft, intake manifold, exhaust manifold. Some 1960s NASCAR and NHRA Hemi engines featured magnesium cross-ram intake manifolds and magnesium oil pans in an attempt to reduce the massive weight of the overall engine, along with chain-driven internal dry-sump oil systems. Today, aftermarket blocks, heads, intakes, rods and pistons are usually made of aluminum.|$|R
2500|$|The engines {{featured}} a large diameter lightweight flywheel at the rear, enclosed {{in a cast}} housing. Engine oil was picked {{up from the bottom}} of the crankcase and slung into a reservoir at the top. [...] From there it was gravity fed, via a gallery high on the right side of the engine block, to the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>caps,</b> and then to the connecting rod journals by centrifugal effect of the turning crankshaft. [...] The <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> were ball bearings and were splash fed. [...] Engine oil from the gallery was also supplied to the 1 : 2 reduction gearbox at the front. This drove the four-bladed propeller at one half engine speed, and the single camshaft was splined into the rear of the short propeller shaft. [...] This arrangement meant that no mechanical oil pump was needed.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{retained}} {{from the}} W-series design were the race-proven Moraine M400 aluminum bearings first {{used in the}} 409, {{as well as the}} highly efficient [...] "side oiling" [...] lubrication system, which assured maximum oil flow to the main and connecting rod bearings at all times. Later blocks intended for performance use had the main oil gallery moved up to the cam bearing bore area and provided [...] "priority main" [...] oiling, improving the oil system even further. These features, along with the robust crankcase design, sturdy forged steel crankshaft and massive four-bolt <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> used in the high performance versions, resulted in what many have considered to be the most rugged and reliable large displacement automotive V8 engine design of all time.|$|R
