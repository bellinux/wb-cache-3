Utilizing the difference of the pixel numbers of adjacent columns, each pixel in a column was inserted to the corresponding adjacent column. Then, the plain image could be stretched to a line. Finally, the line was folded over to the cipher image. Utilizing two different <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>fold,</b> the study designed four maps for permutation.

We study this problem in infinite-dimensional case, when a countable number of roots of characteristic equations tend to an imaginary axis. Under these conditions, we built a special non-linear partial differential equation, which plays the role of a quasinormal form, i. e, it defines the dynamics of the original boundary value problem with the initial conditions in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the equilibrium state. The modified Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation and the Korteweg de Vries Burgers (KdVB) one are quasinormal forms depending on the parameter values. Under some additional assumptions, we apply the procedure of renormalization to the obtained boundary value problems. This procedure leads to an infinite-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. We describe a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>folding</b> this system in the special boundary value problem, which is an analogue of the normal form.

40|$|The {{ability to}} fold and unfold large sensor {{structures}} in space using hinges {{is important for}} space-based sensor technology. Tape spring hinges have become common in deployable space structures due to simplicity, repeatability and unique folding properties. The mechanical response of these hinges (moment-curvature, energy stored etc.) is important in ensuring safety, deployment accuracy as well as optimizing cost of the structure. In an effort {{to learn more about}} the folding and deployment properties, finite element software, Abaqus™, was used to analyze a hinge using multidirectional bending. The analysis involved large deformation (rotation through 180 degrees), nonlinear geometric loading. In order to increase confidence in the analysis procedures, a study was conducted on how the type and size of elements affects stability and buckling of a simply-supported plate. In order to fold a tape spring, a specified length of the middle segment of the hinge was first flattened, so the initial curvature about the long axis of the hinge was removed. This minimizes the moment of inertia and hence stiffness allowing it to be folded. With the middle segment flattened, the hinge was subjected to opposite-sense bending about the hinge’s short axis (axis perpendicular to the length of the tape spring). In addition to providing the needed mechanical response, the study allowed investigation into the optimum <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>folding</b> a hinge. Energy stored during folding and unfolding could be evaluated which allows the designer to determine adequate passive damping to obtain necessary post-deployment stability and pointing accuracy.

40|$|Sequences having zero {{correlation}} {{zones are}} of vital importance in applications, for example, wireless communications and quasi-synchronous CDMA systems. In this thesis, we construct new near perfect sequences of odd and even lengths, {{and those of}} odd lengths are constructed here, for the first time. Near perfect sequences are a special category of zero correlation zone sequences. Near perfect sequences over roots of unity have many potential applications, in cellular communication systems, radar, position sensing and ultrasonic imaging. Our contribution consists of three parts. Part I: First, we provide a method of constructing new near perfect sequences of odd lengths, over the roots of unity. We use a completely orthogonal pair of sequences and a shift sequence obtained by folding a binary M-sequence of length 2 ^ 2 J- 1, row-wise, into a (2 ^J- 1) ×(2 ^J+ 1) array for J≥ 2. We provide many examples of near perfect sequences of odd lengths, illustrating our construction. We prove our main result, that near perfect sequences over the m^th roots of unity, m any odd prime, can be constructed for unbounded lengths. These lengths guarantee arbitrarily long zero correlation zones. Global Position Sensing (GPS) uses sequences of lengths approximately equal to 2 ^ 40. Our method {{can be used to}} construct new near perfect sequences of similar lengths, with very large zero correlation zones, since our construction produces near perfect sequences of unbounded lengths. To examine the universality of our construction, we perform an exhaustive computer search of near perfect sequences of length 15. We found that, of all sequences obtained, one third of the sequences were equivalent to our constructed sequences. We classify these sequences into three types. We also present a variation of our first construction of near perfect sequences. We obtain shift sequences by the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>folding</b> M-sequences of length 2 ^ 2 J- 1, diagonally (rather than row-wise) into arrays with co-prime sizes. Part II: Next, we construct new near perfect sequences of even lengths, by concatenating two distinct near perfect sequences of the same odd length, under some given conditions. Part III: Finally, we examine some cross correlation sequences of some of our near perfect sequences of odd lengths. We find that, for each of our new near perfect sequences, say, s, the cross correlation between s and s^* is also near perfect...|$|E
40|$|Fold recognition, {{assigning}} novel proteins to known structures, {{forms an}} important component of the overall protein structure discovery process. The available methods for protein fold recognition are limited by the low fold-coverage and/or low prediction accuracies. We describe here a new Support Vector Machine (SVM) -based method for protein fold prediction with high prediction accuracy and high fold-coverage. The new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>fold</b> prediction with high fold-coverage was developed by training and testing on a large number <b>of</b> <b>folds</b> in order to make the method suitable for large scale fold predictions. However, presence of large number <b>of</b> <b>folds</b> in the training set made the classification task difficult as a consequence of increased complexity involved in binary classifications of SVMs. In order to overcome this complexity we adopted a hierarchical approach where fold-prediction is made in two steps. At the first step structural class of the query is predicted and at the second step fold is predicted within the predicted structural class. This decreased the complexity of the classification problem and also improved the overall fold prediction accuracy. To the best of our knowledge this is the first taxonomic fold recognition method to cover over 700 protein-folds and gives prediction accuracy of around 70 % on a benchmark dataset. Since the new method gives rise to state of the art prediction performance and hence can be very useful for structural characterization of proteins discovered in various genomes...|$|R

40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología Molecular. Fecha de lectura: 12 - 12 - 2012 Thermostability is {{a desired}} property for many biotechnological applications of enzymes {{because it allows}} an increase in their half-life at the working temperatures and produces a concomitant increase in the stability against organic solvents and detergents. Thermostable enzymes from thermophilic microorganisms are well adapted to such conditions, but not are always available or fulfill {{the role that the}} industry or specific applications require, leading to the development of methods to select thermostable variants from enzymes of mesophilic origin. Some of these methods rely on the deep knowledge of the structure-function relationships of the enzyme to design modifications that increase the thermostability. In other cases the methods of “directed evolution” mimics nature by selecting for a specific property (thermostability) among a high variety of random or semi-random mutants generated by in vitro or in vivo procedures. In directed evolution, the success of the selection depends on the capability to select over a huge amount of variants, and require either robotic system for the analysis of individual variants, or intermediate enrichment selection procedures to decrease the burden of selection. In this Thesis, we have applied the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>folding</b> interference at high temperature in a thermophilic host (Thermus thermophilus) to select thermostable variants of two very different enzymes, a DNA polymerase form bacteriophage φ 29, and the esterase I from Pseudomonas fluorescens (PFEI). The method is based on the expression in the thermophilic host of fusions between the target protein (N-terminal) and a thermostable kanamycin nucleotidyl transferase (C-terminal) as selectable reporter. In {{the first part of the}} experimental work, we isolated T. thermophilus deletion mutants defective in a major LonA-like protease, and checked their suitability as selection host, leading us to conclude that this protease is highly relevant to avoid toxicity of the fusions. In the second and third experimental sections, we isolated “folding-reinforced” mutants of the exonuclease and polymerase domains of the DNA polymerase of F 29 and explained on structural ground their effects on stability. In the final experimental section, we went through the isolation of thermostable variants of the PFEI, and also were able to explain most of the observed effects on structural models. Some of the mutations obtained with both proteins are likely susceptible of patent protection. General conclusions about what can be expected for the general application of this method to isolate thermostable variants of any protein are discussed...|$|E

For secondary structure formation of a selected peptide, RN 24, the structures and dynamics produced by this method agree well with corresponding experimental results. Three most populated conformations are observed, including hairpin, -sheet and -helix. The energetic barriers separating these three structures are comparable to the kinetic energy of the atoms of the peptide, implying that the transition between these states can be easily triggered by kinetic perturbations, mainly through electrostatic interactions between charged atoms. Transitions between -helix and -sheet should jump over at least two energy barriers and may stay in the energetic trap of hairpin. It is proposed that the structure of proteins should be jointly governed by thermodynamic and dynamic factors; free energy is not the exclusive dominant for stability of proteins...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Protein folding rate is an {{important}} property of a protein. Predicting protein folding rate is useful for understanding protein folding process and guiding protein design. Most previous <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> predicting protein <b>folding</b> rate require the tertiary structure of a protein as an input. And most methods do not distinguish the different kinetic nature (two-state folding or multi-state <b>folding)</b> <b>of</b> the proteins. Here we developed a method, SeqRate, to predict both protein folding kinetic type (two-state versus multi-state) and real-value folding rate using sequence length, amino acid composition, contact order, contact number, and secondary structure information predicted from only protein sequence with support vector machines. Results We systematically studied the contributions of individual features to folding rate prediction. On a standard benchmark dataset, the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>folding</b> kinetic type classification is 80 %. The Pearson correlation coefficient and the mean absolute difference between predicted and experimental folding rates (sec - 1) in the base- 10 logarithmic scale are 0. 81 and 0. 79 for two-state protein folders, and 0. 80 and 0. 68 for three-state protein folders. SeqRate is the first sequence-based method for protein folding type classification and its accuracy <b>of</b> <b>fold</b> rate prediction is improved over previous sequence-based methods. Its performance can be further enhanced with additional information, such as structure-based geometric contacts, as inputs.
