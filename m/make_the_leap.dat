500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{said that}} with the album, Madonna began {{her career as a}} disco diva, in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of. In the {{beginning}} of the 80s, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop, and according to him, Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music, utilizing her charisma, chutzpah and sex appeal. Erlewine claimed that Madonna [...] "launched dance-pop" [...] and set the standard for the genre for the next two decades. The staff of Vice magazine stated that the album [...] "drew the blueprint for future dance-pop." [...] Rolling Stone ranked the album at number 50 on [...] "The 100 Best Albums of the Eighties" [...] list, writing: [...] "Indeed, initial response to Madonna gave no indication of the mania to follow. It took {{a year and a half}} for the album to go Gold. But its assured style and sound, as well as Madonna's savvy approach to videos, helped the singer <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> from dance diva to pop phenom, and it pointed the direction for a host of female vocalists from Janet Jackson to Debbie Gibson." ...|$|E

He later declared [...] "it was my great ambition to be introduced to [...] after I jumped off Clifton Bridge in honour of her Jubilee". On the morning of June 21, he prepared to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> but was prevented by a toll collector on the bridge. The following evening, at 7 PM, the same toll collector recognised him and alerted police, who argued that allowing him to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> would be akin to standing idly by as someone threw themselves {{in front of a}} tram-car. They then arrested him on a charge of attempted suicide. Although accompanied by friends willing to pay a bail, this was refused and he remained imprisoned in Horfield Prison until the 30th, then [...] "discharged...upon furnishing sureties that he would make no further effort to jump from the bridge". Unable to raise both a ₤200 bail and two [...] "sureties" [...] of ₤100, he spent a month in prison and planned to attempt the bridge again after a six-month good behaviour bond expired in December.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Lloyd Webber {{contacted}} Cameron Mackintosh, the co-producer of Cats and Song and Dance, {{to propose}} a new musical.

2500|$|As a young man, Wardell studied {{under the}} Gothic {{architect}} Augustus Pugin. Pugin became {{his friend and}} mentor, and was to inspire him not only in architecture but also in his religious convictions. Mixed in the artistic and literary circles of London, he fell in with the philosophies of the Oxford and Cambridge movement, which taught (amongst other things) that Gothic architecture, as symbolized by the great medieval cathedrals of England, was the only form of architecture worthy of God and fostered a spirituality that {{made it easier to}} communicate with God. In 1843 Wardell made the then conventionally unusual decision to convert from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism, adopting the motto [...] "Inveni Quod Quaesivi"( [...] "I have found that which I sought"). This would have been a very difficult decision to make at the time; while Catholics were not actively persecuted in Britain at the time, there was still open discrimination against the faith in certain political and business quarters. The leader of the Oxford movement, John Henry Newman, did not himself <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> of faith until 1845.|$|E

2500|$|In this battle, the {{two factors}} {{combined}} {{to give a}} glimpse of what would end the Plains Indians way of life since horses had made them true nomads. [...] Although the “Comanche” had always been a nomadic people, it was the horse that transformed them into a true nomad culture, and a very warlike one. [...] In the Journal of American History Pekka Hämäläinen [...] estimates, as do most military historians and cultural anthropologists, that it was around 1700 that the Comanche got access to a sufficient number of Spanish horses {{that they were able to}} <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> from dog and human assisted nomadic hunter-gatherer to a true nomad culture. [...] The effects of this transformation were radical. [...] Because they were the first Plains tribe to fully incorporate the horse into their way of life, and into their way of making war, they were far and away the best at it [...] [...] Though it was rare, the only successes the Spanish ever had in battle with the Comanche were on occasions that they were able to take them by surprise. [...] However, since the Comanche became classic horse nomads, this was never easy to do. [...] It was only when the Rangers had adopted classic Comanche tactics of cold camps, forced marches, and use of scouts were they able to alter the dynamic of nomad cavalry attacking fixed settlements. [...] At Little Robe Creek, they in large part succeeded in surprising the Comanche.|$|E

The problem with this question {{is that there is}} no specific income at which a person <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> from being not rich to being rich.

The ground was about thirty feet below, and at a like distance from the building was a wall fully twenty feet high, constructed of polished glass about a foot in thickness. To a red Martian escape by this path would have appeared impossible, but to me, with my earthly strength and agility, it seemed already accomplished.

60|$|On {{this day}} the run was not less {{exciting}} than usual. The horses were placed as nearly abreast {{as possible and}} the starter gave an Indian yell. Then followed the cracking of whips, the furious pounding of heavy hoofs, the commands of the contestants, and the yells of the onlookers. Away they went at a mad pace down the road. The course extended a mile straight away down the creek bottom. The first hundred yards the horses were bunched. At the ditch beyond the creek bridge a beautiful, clean limbed animal darted from among the furiously galloping horses and sailed over the deep furrow like a bird. All recognized the rider as Alfred Clarke on his black thoroughbred. Close behind was George Martin mounted on a large roan of powerful frame and long stride. Through the willows they dashed, over logs and brush heaps, up the little ridges of rising ground, and down the shallow gullies, unheeding the stinging branches and the splashing water. Half the distance covered and Alfred turned, to find the roan close behind. On a level road he would have laughed at the attempt of that horse {{to keep up with}} his racer, but he was beginning to fear that the strong limbed stallion deserved his reputation. Directly before them rose a pile of logs and matted brush, placed there by the daredevil settlers who had mapped out the route. It was too high for any horse to be put at. With pale cheek and clinched teeth Alfred touched the spurs to Roger and then threw himself forward. The gallant beast responded nobly. Up, up, up he rose, clearing all but the topmost branches. Alfred turned again and saw the giant roan <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> without touching a twig. The next instant Roger went splash into a swamp. He sank to his knees in the soft black soil. He could move but one foot at a time, and Alfred saw at a glance he had won the race. The great weight of the roan handicapped him here. When Alfred reached {{the other side of the}} bog, where the bottle was swinging from a branch of a tree, his rival's horse was floundering hopelessly in the middle of the treacherous mire. The remaining three horsemen, who had come up by this time, seeing that it would be useless to attempt further efforts, had drawn up on the bank. With friendly shouts to Clarke, they acknowledged themselves beaten. There were no judges required for this race, because the man who reached the bottle first won it.|$|E
