All the situations it collects represent the state-of-the-art of existing PV installations all around Europe. They show how the different parts of an installation can be implem ented properly or not. The aim of this manual is to represent a reference text which can help any PV actor (installers, <b>electricians,</b> <b>maintenance</b> operators, owners, etc.) not only to check and improve an already existing installation but will also, and mainly, avoid the previously known bad practices {{for the construction of a}} new PV installation. Thus, solving a priori the known errors, new PV installations will be more reliable, efficient and cost-effective and can recover the initial investment in a shorter time. The manual is going to be free available in the PVCROPS website in several languages...|$|R
