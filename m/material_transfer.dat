25|$|Plans {{were made}} for a {{parallel}} subway line even before the NYW's abandonment; a 1929 expansion plan included a line along Morris Park Avenue, Wilson Avenue and Boston Road to Baychester Avenue, fed by the IND Second Avenue Line. When the IND Concourse Line was being built, the City, {{as part of the}} 1929 expansion plan, planned the line to be extended further east via Burke Avenue and Boston Road to Baychester Avenue. However, due to the Great Depression, money for the line ran out, and as a result the integration of the NYW line was seen as a cheaper way to serve the Northeast Bronx. In 1939, after abandonment, the plan was to integrate the former NYW to Dyre Avenue into the IRT system branching off the IRT Pelham Line as the Westchester and Boston Line. It was later decided to only utilize the line north of the East 180th Street station, even though the line continued to the Harlem River Terminal paralleling the New Haven Railroad right-of-way. However, a track connection to the New Haven Railroad (NHRR) was built in 1955 for equipment and <b>material</b> <b>transfer</b> and interchanges, including new car deliveries. The R17s were delivered via this connection in 1955, and the R33/R36s were delivered via the connection in February 1964.|$|E
2500|$|This type of {{thickness}} variation has many causes, {{but there are}} three primary mechanisms which contribute the most to the propagation of disc {{thickness variation}}s connected to uneven pad transfer. The first is improper selection of brake pads for a given application. Pads which are effective at low temperatures, such as when braking {{for the first time}} in cold weather, often are made of materials which decompose unevenly at higher temperatures. This uneven decomposition results in uneven deposition of material onto the brake disc. Another cause of uneven <b>material</b> <b>transfer</b> is improper break in of a pad/disc combination. For proper break in, the disc surface should be refreshed (either by machining the contact surface or by replacing the disc as a whole) every time the pads are changed on a vehicle. Once this is done, the brakes are heavily applied multiple times in succession. This creates a smooth, even interface between the pad and the disc. When this is not done properly the brake pads will see an uneven distribution of stress and heat, resulting in an uneven, seemingly random, deposition of pad material. The third primary mechanism of uneven pad <b>material</b> <b>transfer</b> is known as [...] "pad imprinting." [...] This occurs when the brake pads are heated to the point that the material begins to break-down and transfer to the disc. In a properly broken in brake system (with properly selected pads), this transfer is natural and actually is a major contributor to the braking force generated by the brake pads. However, if the vehicle comes to a stop and the driver continues to apply the brakes, the pads will deposit a layer of material in the shape of the brake pad. This small thickness variation can begin the cycle of uneven pad transfer.|$|E

We find that a persistent accretion disk is formed around the neutron star in both cases. The circularization radius of the <b>material</b> <b>transferred</b> via Roche lobe overflow is larger {{than that of the}} <b>material</b> <b>transfered</b> from the Be disk. Thus, the growth of the accretion disk in the former case becomes significantly slower than in the latter case. In both cases, the mass accretion rate is very small and varies little with orbital phase, which is consistent with the observed X-ray behaviour of Be/X-ray binaries with circular orbits (e. g.
