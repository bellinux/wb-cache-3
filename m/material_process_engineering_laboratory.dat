40|$|Abstract This thesis {{describes}} part of {{the work}} that has been done in the Chemical <b>Process</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>Laboratory</b> of the University of Oulu to systematize conceptual process design. The aim has been to develop a design methodology, i. e. how process design is done, based on a carefully elaborated concept analysis. The starting point has been that all the knowledge related to process design, i. e. not only the procedural knowledge related to the design activity itself, but also the declarative knowledge related to the design target (process) and the environment (project) in which the design is done, should be systematized. The process design methodology can be represented within a single formalism by treating the activity, target and resources as structural parts of the project object. In that case, each design decision becomes properly constrained by the goal and the resources available, and is also stored together with the domain knowledge on which the decision was based. This holistic approach was adopted when the phenomenon driven process design methodology was built to systematize chemical process development while simultaneously supporting creativity. This thesis concentrates on knowledge generation activity as {{part of the}} phenomenon driven process design methodology. A brief description of the generic chemical process object model is presented, after which {{the focus is on the}} design activity and the strategy of design. The phenomenon driven process design of an MTBE production process is described as an illustration of the methodology. It is shown how combinations of reaction and separation, such as reactive distillation, evolve naturally during a design project. For the evaluation of attainable state distributions, which is an important design task implied by the methodology, a robust method was developed to solve the modified MESH equations of reactive distillation. The method was also applied when developing a rigorous calculation method for the determination of minimum energy demand of multicomponent distillation...|$|R
40|$|The misapplication of QbD for {{purposes}} {{for which it}} was not intended for is unwise andlikely to be counterproductive. It would be a shame if, by virtue of such misapplication, the QbD paradigm were to be maligned or abandoned, because there is no denying that it does bring added value to pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. Ill-conceived and/or improper application of QbD, including any that treat pharmaceutical processes as “modular” and being totally mathematically patterned, must be curbed. The proper application of QbD to establish and optimize the ‘design space’ of thoughtfully developed (i. e. grounded in a sufficient knowledge and understanding of physical and organic chemistry, <b>materials</b> science, <b>process</b> <b>engineering</b> together with experience and judgement) formulations and processes should be increased, so that its full potential may then be realized...|$|R
