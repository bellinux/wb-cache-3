40|$|On {{the level}} of {{quality of life in}} the cities, street crimes play a {{relevant}} role because the safety of citizens is involved. It is a world wide problem that is now increasing in relation to a number of factors, among them the new migrations, {{the level of}} <b>maintenace</b> of the towns, the level of community policing. The terminology of street crimes is commonly referred to minor crimes such as vandalism, graffiti, theft, robberies, fights, but the usually open the street to heavier crimes, from drug dealing and prostitution and so on. From the second half of last century (Shaw, McKay) it is accepted that a poor town level, lack of services and <b>maintenace,</b> are good incentives to street crimes. In 1982 Kelling e Wilson wrote a famous paper about “broken windows” where they offer the theory that a broken window is an evidence of lack of interest for the neighborhoods thus inducing a criminal mind to act incorrectly. The solution is of course a town designed on the basis of crime prevention through environmental design, and on this direction are acting some towns, for a limited part of them, due to the costs of the intervention.

In this particular study, the traditional ”compiler ” ap-proach in Java is compared to the ANTLR ”compiler generator”.

40|$|The {{control system}} for the SPS-BA 6 cooling towers station is {{considered}} in order to introduce {{the concept of a}} multivariable process. Multivariable control means the <b>maintenace</b> of several controlled variables at independent set points. In a single-variable system, to keep the single process variables within their critical values is considered a rather simple operation. In a complex multivariable system, the determination of the optimal operation point results in a combination of all set values of the variables. Control of a multivariable system requires therefore a more complex analysis. As the solution based on a mathematical model of the process is far beyond acceptable complexity, most mathematical models involve extensive simplifications and linearizations to optimize the resulting controllers. In this report the author will demonstrate how fuzzy logic might provide elegant and efficient solutions in the design of multivariable control based on experimental results rather than on mathematical models. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} in more electric aircraft {{to achieve a}} higher cost benefit, resulting from the reduction of weight and maintenance effort, is the total electrification of the primary flight control system by the application of electro-mechanical actuators (EMAs). As these aircraft systems are designed as fail-operational, failures of a single system have to be unlikely. However, EMA have a significant risk to jam that can be mostly traced back to failures of mechanical components. Regular inspections and scheduled maintenance are generally well-established practices to prevent failures. However, unpredictable failures results in unscheduled <b>maintenace</b> activities that causes high costs. Therefore, the future perspective focusses on on-condition maintenance. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} to present an algorithm that detects bearing faults early, by using a vibration-based condition monitoring method. It shows a diagnosis automation concept, the principle of its implementation and the validation result. It proposes an application for flight control EMAs aiming to replace regular inspection activities and to improve maintenance planning...|$|E
40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we present}} an algorithm for using possibly inaccurate knowledge of model derivatives {{as a part}} of the training data for a multilayer perceptron network (MLP). In many practical process control problems there are many well-known rules about the effect of control variables to the target variables. With the presented algorithm the basically data driven neural network model can be trained to comply with these a priori rules, making the models more correct and decreasing the amount of required training data. Since the training of the rules is based on statistical error minimization, the rules may be numerically inaccurate or contradictory. This makes the collection and <b>maintenace</b> of the rule bases much less expensive than in rule based expert systems. Currently we are incorporating the derivative based training into a commercial neural network process control tool. 1 Introduction One of the most important traits of neural networks is generality.

40|$|Masonry arch bridges {{constitute}} {{a significant proportion}} of European road and rail infrastructures. Most of them are well over 100  years old and are supporting traffic loads many times above those originally envisaged. The inherent variation in their constituent materials, the traditional design criteria and methods used for their construction, their deterioration over time caused by weathering processes and the development of other defects, significantly influence the mechanical response of these historic structures. A deep understanding on the numerous factors that affect the structural behaviour of masonry arch bridges and on the analysis methods to assess the life expectancy of such bridges and inform maintenance and strengthening strategies is essential. This paper provides a critical review of the experimental studies that have been carried out and of the assessment approaches that have been developed in the last three decades to these aims.

40|$|AbstractMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that codes protein {{subunits}} {{essential for}} the <b>maintenace</b> of mitochondrial ATP synthesis system acquires mutations {{at a much higher}} rate than that in nuclear DNA. Recent study has revealed that somatically acquired mutations such as deletions in mtDNA are caused mainly by oxygen free-radical damage. Cumulative accumulation of these somatic mutations during the life of an individual causes bioenergetic deficit leading to cell death and normal ageing. The base-sequencing of the entire mtDNA from 48 individuals revealed that germ-line point mutations accelerate extensively the somatic oxygen free-radical damage and the deletions leading to generation of more than a hundred kinds of mtDNA minicircle. These accelerated somatic mutations are expressed as premature ageing of the patients with degenerative diseases. Comprehensive analyses of the entire mtDNA, including the total base-sequencing and the total deletion correlating with oxygen free-radical damage, has revealed a clear relationship between the genotype and its phenotype, such as the severity of clinical symptoms and the survival time of the patients. Extensive generation of mtDNA minicircles caused by the oxygen free radical implies a close relation between the redox mechanism of ageing and the programmed cell-death machinery...|$|E
