25|$|<b>Markhor</b> are {{potential}} prey for snow leopards, brown bears, lynx, jackals, and golden eagles. While not directly causing their endangerment, the already small population of <b>markhor</b> is further threatened by their predation. Hunting for meat {{as a means}} of subsistence or trade in wildlife parts adds to the growing problem for wildlife managers in many countries. Poaching, with its indirect impacts as disturbance, increasing fleeing distances and resulting reduction of effective habitat size, {{is by far the most}} important factor threatening the survival of the <b>markhor</b> population. The most important types of poachers seem to be local inhabitants, state border guards, the latter usually relying on local hunting guides, and Afghans, illegally crossing the border.

25|$|The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources has {{classified}} the <b>markhor</b> as {{an endangered}} species, meaning {{it is in}} danger of facing extinction in the near future if conservation efforts are not maintained. There have been different estimates as to how many markhors exist but a global estimate put the number at less than 2,500 mature individuals. There are reservations in Tajikistan to protect the markhors. In 1973, two reservations were established. The Dashtijum Strict Reserve (also called the Zapovednik in Russian) offers <b>markhor</b> protect across 20,000 ha. The Dashtijum Reserve (called the Zakasnik in Russian) covers 53,000 ha. Though these reserves exist to protect and conserve the <b>markhor</b> population, the regulations are poorly enforced making poaching common as well as habitat destruction. Although markhors still face ongoing threats, recent studies have shown considerable success with regards to the conservation approach. The approach began in the 1900s when a local hunter was convinced by a hunting tourist to stop poaching markhors. The local hunter established a conservancy that inspired two other local organizations called Morkhur and Muhofiz. The two organizations expect that their conversations will not only protect, but allow them to sustainability use the <b>markhor</b> species. This approach has been very effective compared to the protect lands that lack enforcement and security. In India, the <b>markhor</b> is a fully protected (Schedule I) species under Jammu and Kashmir’s Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1978.|$|E

25|$|Within Afghanistan, the Astor <b>markhor</b> {{is limited}} to the east in the high and mountainous monsoon forests of Laghman and Nuristan. In India, this {{subspecies}} is restricted to a portion of the Pir Panjal range in southwestern Jammu and Kashmir. Throughout this range, Astor <b>markhor</b> populations are scattered, starting east of the Banihal Pass (50km from the Chenab River) on the Jammu-Srinagar highway westward to the disputed border with Pakistan. Recent surveys indicate it still occurs in catchments of the Limber and Lachipora Rivers in the Jhelum Valley Forest Division, and around Shupiyan to the south of Srinagar. In Pakistan, the Astor <b>markhor</b> there is restricted to the Indus and its tributaries, {{as well as to the}} Kunar (Chitral) River and its tributaries. Along the Indus, it inhabits both banks from Jalkot (Kohistan District) upstream to near the Tungas village (Baltistan), with Gakuch being its western limit up the Gilgit River, Chalt up the Hunza River, and the Parishing Valley up the Astore River. It has been said to occur on the right side of the Yasin Valley (Gilgit District), though this is unconfirmed. The flare-horned <b>markhor</b> is also found around Chitral and the border areas with Afghanistan, where it inhabits a number of valleys along the Kunar River (Chitral District), from Arandu on the west bank and Drosh on the east bank, up to Shoghor along the Lutkho River, and as far as Barenis along the Mastuj River. The largest population is currently found in Chitral National Park in Pakistan.|$|E

Four species of ungulates native to India and China reside in this exhibit. They are blackbuck, mouflon, Himalayan tahr and takin. The Metro Richmond Zoo {{is one of the}} few zoos in the United States to have takin on display, as it is considered a national treasure in China and receives the same protection as the giant panda. The exhibit opened in 2003. On June 6, 2017, five <b>markhors</b> were added to the exhibit.|$|R
25|$|The diet of {{the snow}} leopard varies across its range and with the time of year, and depends on prey availability. In the Himalayas, it preys mostly on bharals (Himalayan blue sheep), but in other {{mountain}} ranges, such as the Karakoram, Tian Shan, Altai and Tost Mountains of Mongolia, its main prey consists of Siberian ibex and argali, a type of wild sheep, although the latter has become rarer in some parts {{of the snow}} leopard's range. Other large animals eaten when available can include various types of wild goats and sheep (such as <b>markhors</b> and urials), other goat-like ruminants such as Himalayan tahr and gorals, plus deer, red panda, wild boars, and langur monkeys. Smaller prey consists of marmots, woolly hares, pikas, various rodents, and birds such as the snow cock and chukar.|$|R
40|$|A {{pneumonia}} outbreak {{reduced the}} numbers of a wild population of endangered <b>markhors</b> (Capra falconeri) in Tajikistan in 2010. The infection was diagnosed by histologic examination and bacteriologic testing. Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum was the sole infectious agent detected. Cross-species transmission from domestic goats may have occurred. Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum and M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae are closely related subspecies of the M. mycoides cluster (1). Whereas M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae is the etiologic agent of contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP), a severe and typically lethal respiratory disease, M. capricolum subsp. capricolum infection is usually not fatal and instead results in chronic inflammation {{in a variety of}} organs, including joints, udder, eyes, and lungs (2). M. capricolum subsp. capricolum infection occurs worldwide and appears widespread but has rarely been found in species of small ruminants other than domestic goats and, more occasionally, sheep (2, 3). This lack of evidence may be partially because few studies have applied sensitive molecular techniques for its detection in nondomestic ruminants (2, 3). Domestic goats can carry M. capricolum subsp. capricolum asymptomatically, notably in the ea...|$|R

5000|$|The {{biosphere}} reserve {{is home to}} the largest area of juniper forest (Juniperus excelsa) in Pakistan, covering about 110,000 hectares. It is believed that the forest is the second largest {{of its kind in the}} world. The juniper species found there are of global significance because of their advanced age and slow growth rate. In fact, the junipers of Ziarat are among the oldest living trees in the world. Although no dendrological study has yet been conducted, according to one estimate, the age of a mature tree in Ziarat can exceed 5,000 years. Local people refer to the trees as [...] "living fossils". Their remarkable longevity allows research on past weather conditions in the region, making the species of particular significance for studies on climate change and ecology.The juniper forest ecosystem of Ziarat provides a habitat for endangered wildlife species and supports a rich variety of plant species. Because of the ecosystem's biodiversity, various parts of it have been designated protected areas, including wildlife sanctuaries and game reserves. The mountain ranges, including the Khilafat Hills, consist of a core habitat that reportedly hosts several globally important wild species, among them <b>markhors,</b> urials, black bears and wolves. The forest also serves as a habitat for a number of other animals: Afghan pikas, foxes, jackals and several species of migratory birds. However, anthropological factors such as illegal hunting, human habitations and livestock grazing have encroached on the wildlife habitats, leading to their fragmentation. The human population, distributed across various sub-tribes and clans, is concentrated in valleys, although small settlements are visible on mountain slopes. There are over 100,000 people living within or in close proximity to the {{biosphere reserve}}, most of whom are agropastoralists. Almost 40 percent of the population migrates for three to four months during the winter to abodes in Harnai.Livestock was formerly the primary source of livelihood in the reserve. Today, it has been displaced by the development of agriculture and, in particular, the promotion of horticultural crops such as apple and cherry orchards.|$|R
25|$|<b>Markhor</b> are {{adapted to}} mountainous terrain, {{and can be}} found between 600 and 3,600 meters in elevation. They {{typically}} inhabit scrub forests made up primarily of oaks (Quercus ilex), pines (Pinus gerardiana), and junipers (Juniperus macropoda). They are diurnal, and are mainly active in the early morning and late afternoon. Their diets shift seasonally: {{in the spring and summer}} periods they graze, but turn to browsing in winter, sometimes standing on their hind legs to reach high branches. The mating season takes place in winter, during which the males fight each other by lunging, locking horns and attempting to push each other off balance. The gestation period lasts 135–170 days, and usually results in the birth of one or two kids, though rarely three. <b>Markhor</b> live in flocks, usually numbering nine animals, composed of adult females and their young. Adult males are largely solitary. Adult females and kids comprise most of the <b>markhor</b> population, with adult females making up 32% of the population and kids making up 31%. Adult males comprise 19%, while subadults (males aged 2–3 years) make up 12%, and yearlings (females aged 12–24 months) make up 9% of the population. Their alarm call closely resembles the bleating of domestic goats. Early in the season the males and females may be found together on the open grassy patches and clear slopes among the forest. During the summer, the males remain in the forest, while the females generally climb to the highest rocky ridges above.|$|E
25|$|The BBC One TV series Planet Earth had {{a segment}} on snow leopards. The series {{took some of}} the first video of snow leopards in the wild, and also {{featured}} a snow leopard hunting a <b>markhor.</b> The episode Mountains of Planet Earth II, aired in November 2016, featured the rather violent mating fights of snow leopards, as well as a snow leopard's chuffing and wailing.|$|E
25|$|Fecal {{samples taken}} from <b>markhor</b> and {{domestic}} goats {{indicate that there}} is a serious level of competition for food between the two species. The competition for food between herbivores is believed to have significantly reduced the standing crop of forage in the Himalaya-Karkoram-Hindukush ranges. Domestic livestock have an advantage over wild herbivores since the density of their herds often pushes their competitors out of the best grazing areas. Decreased forage availability has a negative effect on female fertility.|$|E
25|$|Snow leopards are {{carnivores}} {{and actively}} hunt their prey. Like many cats, {{they are also}} opportunistic feeders, eating whatever meat they can find, including carrion and domestic livestock. They can kill animals two to four times their own weight, such as the bharal, Himalayan tahr, <b>markhor,</b> argali, horse, and camel, but will readily take much smaller prey, such as hares and birds. They are capable of killing most animals in their range with the probable exception of the adult male yak. Unusually among cats, snow leopards also eat {{a significant amount of}} vegetation, including grass and twigs. Snow leopards will also hunt in pairs successfully, especially mating pairs.|$|E
25|$|Until 1978, the Kabul <b>markhor</b> {{survived in}} Afghanistan {{only in the}} Kabul Gorge and the Kohe Safi area of Kapissa, and in some {{isolated}} pockets in between. It now lives the most inaccessible regions of its once wider range {{in the mountains of}} Kapissa and Kabul Provinces, after having been driven from its original habitat due to intensive poaching. In Pakistan, its present range consists only of small isolated areas in Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province and in Dera Ghazi Khan District (Punjab Province). The KPK Forest Department considered that the areas of Mardan and Sheikh Buddin were still inhabited by the subspecies. At least 100 animals are thought to live on the Pakistani side of the Safed Koh range (Districts of Kurram and Khyber).|$|E
25|$|Although the Bukharan <b>markhor</b> (Capra falconeri heptneri) {{formerly}} {{lived in}} most of the mountains stretching along the north banks of the Upper Amu Darya and the Pyanj Rivers from Turkmenistan to Tajikistan, two to three scattered populations now occur in a greatly reduced distribution. It is limited to the region between lower Pyanj and the Vakhsh Rivers near Kulyab in Tajikistan (about 70”E and 37’40’ to 38”N), and in the Kugitangtau Range in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan (around 66’40’E and 37’30’N). This subspecies may possibly exist in the Darwaz Peninsula of northern Afghanistan near the border with Tajikistan. Before 1979, almost nothing was known of this subspecies or its distribution in Afghanistan, and no new information has been developed in Afghanistan since that time.|$|E
25|$|Prey {{animals in}} India include chital, sambar, muntjac, mouse deer, swamp deer, wild boar, gaur, water buffalo, banteng, cattle, nilgai, goats, Indian hares, Himalayan field rats and langurs. There is one {{record of a}} pack {{bringing}} down an Indian elephant calf in Assam, despite desperate defense of the mother resulting in numerous losses to the pack. In Kashmir, they prey on <b>markhor,</b> and thamin in Myanmar, Malayan tapir, Sumatran serow in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, and Javan rusa in Java. In the Tien Shan and Tarbagatai Mountains, dholes prey on Siberian ibexes, arkhar, roe deer, maral and wild boar. In the Altai and Sayan Mountains, they prey on musk deer and reindeer. In eastern Siberia, they prey on roe deer, Manchurian wapiti, wild pig, musk deer, and reindeer, while in Primorye they feed on sika deer and goral, too. In Mongolia, they prey on argali and rarely Siberian ibex. Like African wild dogs, but unlike wolves, dholes are not known to attack people. Dholes eat fruit and vegetable matter more readily than other canids. In captivity, they eat various kinds of grasses, herbs and leaves, seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill. In summertime in the Tien Shan Mountains, dholes eat large quantities of mountain rhubarb. Although opportunistic, dholes have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calves. Livestock predation by dholes {{has been a problem}} in Bhutan since the late 1990s, as domestic animals are often left outside to graze in the forest, sometimes for weeks at a time. Livestock stall-fed at night and grazed near homes are never attacked. Oxen are killed more often than cows, probably because they are given less protection.|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{authors have}} {{postulated}} that the <b>markhor</b> is the ancestor of some breeds of domestic goat. The Angora goat has been regarded {{by some as}} a direct descendant of the Central Asian <b>markhor.</b> Charles Darwin postulated that modern goats arose from crossbreeding <b>markhor</b> with wild goats. Evidence for markhors crossbreeding with domestic goats has been found. One study suggested that 35.7% of captive markhors in the analysis (ranging from three different zoos) had mitochondrial DNA from domestic goats. Other authors have put forth the possibility of <b>markhor</b> being the ancestor of some Egyptian goat breeds, due to their similar horns, though the lack of an anterior keel on the horns of the <b>markhor</b> belies any close relationship. The Changthangi domestic goat of Ladakh and Tibet may derive from the <b>markhor.</b> The Girgentana goat of Sicily is thought to have been bred from <b>markhor,</b> as is the Bilberry goat of Ireland. The Kashmiri feral herd of about 200 individuals on the Great Orme limestone headland of Wales are derived from a herd maintained at Windsor Great Park [...] belonging to Queen Victoria.|$|E
2500|$|In British India, <b>markhor</b> were {{considered}} to be among the most challenging game species, due to the danger involved in stalking and pursuing them in high, mountainous terrain. According to Arthur Brinckman, in his The Rifle in Cashmere, [...] "a man who is a good walker will never wish for any finer sport than ibex or markhoor shooting". Elliot Roosevelt wrote of how he shot two <b>markhor</b> in 1881, his first on 8 July, his second on 1 August. Although it is illegal to hunt <b>markhor</b> in Afghanistan, they have been traditionally hunted in Nuristan and Laghman Provinces, and this may have intensified during the War in Afghanistan. In Pakistan, hunting <b>markhor</b> is legal as part of a conservation process, expensive hunting licenses are available from the Pakistani government which allow for the hunting of old markhors which are no longer good for breeding purposes. In India, it is illegal to hunt <b>markhor</b> but they are poached for food and for their horns, which are thought to have medicinal properties. <b>Markhor</b> have also been successfully introduced to private game ranches in Texas. Unlike the aoudad, blackbuck, nilgai, ibex, and axis deer, however, <b>markhor</b> have not escaped in sufficient numbers to establish free-range wild populations in Texas.|$|E

The fur of the lower legs is black and white. <b>Markhor</b> are sexually dimorphic, with males having longer hair on the chin, throat, chest and shanks. Females are redder in colour, with shorter hair, a short black beard, and are maneless. Both sexes have tightly curled, corkscrew-like horns, which close together at the head, but spread upwards toward the tips. The horns of males can grow up to [...] long, and up to [...] in females.

Destitute of beauty but not without use, the scaly ant-eater is frequently seen; but the most common of all the beasts is an odious species of large lizard, nearly three feet long, which resembles a flabby-skinned crocodile and feeds on carrion. Domestic fowls, goats, sheep and oxen, with the inevitable vulture, and an occasional eagle, complete the fauna.|$|E
