500|$|In April 2002, Hewson {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} of an effort which {{delivered}} over a million postcards demanding that the facility be shut down; recipients included British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prince Charles, and Norman Askew, head of British Nuclear Fuels Limited. (The message to the first said, [...] "Tony, look <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and tell me I'm safe.") She personally delivered a giant postcard to Blair at 10Downing Street. The Shut Sellafield Campaign had its postcards stocked in Superquinn and Dunnes Stores supermarkets, and Hewson publicly engaged Tesco when they refused to do the same. The campaign was backed by celebrities, including Ronan Keating and Samantha Mumba, and Hewson made many newspaper and radio appearances on its behalf. It was the first prolonged exposure Hewson had to the public eye, after two decades of mostly being focused upon maintaining her privacy. Her continued activism also meant that she too would not always be around for the couple's children.|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Jim Parsons {{noted the}} writers' response, but added that, in his opinion, Sheldon [...] "couldn't display more traits" [...] of Asperger's.

He also stated that [...] "the way [...] brain works, it's so focused on the intellectual topics at hand that thinking he's autistic is an easy leap for people watching the show to make".|$|E

[...] He was then told about the fire, but he denied having {{anything}} to do with it, claiming that he was not near the farm when the blaze occurred. A youth, John Solyem, was brought forward. He said that he had been watching the Gunness place and that he saw Lamphere running down the road from the Gunness house just before the structure erupted in flames. Lamphere snorted to the boy: [...] "You wouldn't look <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and say that!" ...|$|E
