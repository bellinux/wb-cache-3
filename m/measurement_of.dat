Blood tests in general aim to measure thyroid function or determine the cause of thyroid dysfunction.

40|$|Two <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> A and B {{are carried}} out one after the other. The <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> A are {{controlled}} by the parameter λ_A in the Kraus operator, where the <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> B are controlled by the parameter λ_B. Strong measurements imply that the parameters in the Kraus operators approach infinite large values while weak measurements {{are carried out}} when the parameters approach zero. Here we prove that by repeating on the two successive <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> A and B then: (1) Average over all <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> A is invariant <b>of</b> the <b>measurement</b> strength parameters λ_A and λ_B. It implies that all surprising results obtained in weak <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> A are washed out when the average is taken. (2) If the operators Â and B̂ commute then the mean value of B as obtained by taking {{the average of the}} results for B over all <b>measurements</b> is invariant <b>of</b> λ_A and λ_B. Moreover it is exactly equal to the expectation value of B̂ as expected for strong <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> B. (3) If Â and B̂ do not commute and another condition given in this paper is satisfied then the mean value of the results obtained for B depends on the value of λ_A and not on the value of λ_B. An illustrative possible experiment to show the effect of the strength <b>of</b> the <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> A on the results obtained for the <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> B is given...|$|R

50|$|Absolute {{scales are}} used when precise values {{are needed in}} {{comparison}} to a natural, unchanging zero point. <b>Measurements</b> <b>of</b> length, area and volume are inherently absolute, although <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> distance are often based on an arbitrary starting point. <b>Measurements</b> <b>of</b> weight can be absolute, such as atomic weight, but more often they are <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> the relationship between two masses, while <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> speed are relative to an arbitrary reference frame. (Unlike many other measurements without a known, absolute minimum, speed has a known maximum and can be measured from a purely relative scale.) Absolute scales {{can be used for}} measuring a variety of things, from the flatness of an optical flat to neuroscientific tests.|$|R

5|$|Voyager 1s mission {{included}} a flyby of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which {{had long been}} known to have an atmosphere. Images taken by Pioneer 11 in 1979 had indicated the atmosphere was substantial and complex, further increasing interest. The Titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to Saturn compromising observations, and approached to within , passing behind Titan as seen from Earth and the Sun. Voyager's <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the atmosphere's effect on sunlight, and Earth-based <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> {{its effect on the}} probe's radio signal were used to determine the atmosphere's composition, density, and pressure. Titan's mass was also measured by observing its effect on the probe's trajectory. Thick haze prevented any visual observation of the surface, but the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the atmosphere's composition, temperature, and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on the surface.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} of quantum {{mechanics}} is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which forbids the simultaneous <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the position and momentum of a particle along the same direction.
