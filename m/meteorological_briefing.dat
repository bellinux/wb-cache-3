The {{data showed that}} a huge, cloud mass with very low cloud base, transited through Kinshasa Terminal Area from North East Direction, affected Kinshasa Airfield, before moving away in South West direction. Kinshasa meteorological observers, not being equipped with weather radar, {{were not aware of}} the approach of this severe weather system. On the day of the accident, before departing from Kinshasa, the crew were given a thorough <b>meteorological</b> <b>briefing</b> by the PAE provided service. After completing the Kinshasa – Kisangani sector, the crew were provided another weather update, including being provided latest satellite imagery of the weather en route to Kinshasa.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the development of}} a database of high-impact weather events that occurred in Greece since 2001. The selected events are related to the occurrence of floods, flash floods, hail, snow/frost, tornados, windstorms, heat waves and lightning with adverse consequences (excluding those related to agriculture). The database includes, among others, the geographical distribution of the recorded events, relevant <b>meteorological</b> data, a <b>brief</b> description of the induced impacts and references in the press. This paper further offers an extensive analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution of high-impact weather events for the period 2001 – 2011, taking into account the intensity of weather conditions and the consequent impact on the society. Analysis of the monthly distribution of high-impact weather events showed that they are more frequent during October and November. More than 80 people lost their lives, half of which due to flash floods. In what concerns the spatial distribution of high-impact weather events, among the 51 prefectures of the country, Attica, Thessaloniki, Elia and Halkidiki were the most frequently affected areas, mainly by flash floods. Significant was also the share of tornados in Elia, of windstorms in Attica, of lightning and hail events in Halkidiki and of snow/frost events in Thessaloniki...|$|R
40|$|Snow cover {{appears as}} a key {{indicator}} in climate change, {{and the ability to}} remotely measure the physical properties of snow is of vital importance. Current model-based approaches used to interpret satellite and airborne data need much stronger experimental confirmation. PolInSAR is a promising emerging technique for the measurement of snow depth. It exploits the polarisation dependence of scattering mechanisms to estimate scattering phase centre heights, which can be extrapolated to retrieve snow depth. Both modelling work and previous experimental campaigns indicate that the X and Ku-bands are particularly suited for retrieving the physical properties of a snow pack as they are sensitive to both the surface and volume characteristics. However, no comprehensive assessment of the operational potential and limitations of PolInSAR are yet available for snow. This work investigates the conditions under which PolInSAR produces accurate results with respect to snow parameters such as structural features and metamorphic state, as well as technical sensor specifications. A field study of the PolInSAR X- and Ku-band response of alpine snow was carried out with the UK’s Ground-Based SAR (GBSAR) system in a measurement campaign in the Austrian Alps during early 2007. Complementary detailed snow state and structural parameters were also recorded, as well as environmental <b>meteorological</b> data. A <b>brief</b> outline of the experimental technique is presented, and an example of an interferometric product...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePOLDER is a CNES {{instrument}} {{on board}} NASDA's ADEOS polar orbiting satellite, which was successfully launched in August 1996. On October 30, 1996, POLDER entered its nominal acquisition phase and worked perfectly until ADEOS's early {{end of service}} on June 30, 1997. POLDER is a multispectral imaging radiometer/polarimeter designed to collect global and repetitive observations of the solar radiation reflected by the Earth/atmosphere system, with a wide field of view (2400 km) and a moderate geometric resolution (6 km). The instrument concept is based on telecentric optics, on a rotating wheel carrying 15 spectral filters and polarizers, and on a bidimensional charge coupled device (CCD) detector array. In addition to the classical measurement and mapping characteristics of a narrow-band imaging radiometer, POLDER has a unique ability to measure polarized reflectances using three polarizers (for three of its eight spectral bands, 443 to 910 nm) and to observe target reflectances from 13 different viewing directions during a single satellite pass. One of POLDER's original features is that its in-flight radiometric calibration does not rely on any on-board device. Many calibration methods using well-characterized calibration targets {{have been developed to}} achieve a very high calibration accuracy. This paper presents the various methods implemented in the in-flight calibration plan and the results obtained during the instrument calibration phase: absolute calibration over molecular scattering, interband calibration over sunglint and clouds, multiangular calibration over deserts and clouds, intercalibration with Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (OCTS), and water vapor channels calibration over sunglint using <b>meteorological</b> analysis. A <b>brief</b> description of the algorithm and of the performances of each method is give...|$|R
