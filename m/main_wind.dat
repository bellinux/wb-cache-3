6000|$|Nor, alas, is the Du Chatelet {{relation}} itself so celestial {{as it once}} was. Madame has discovered, {{think only}} with what feelings, that this great man does not love her as formerly! The great man denies, ready to deny on the Gospels, to her and to himself; and yet, at bottom, if we read with the microscope, there are symptoms, {{and it is not}} deniable. How should it? Leafy May, hot June, by degrees comes October, sere, yellow; and at last, a quite leafless condition,--not Favonius, but gray Northeast, with its hail-storms (jealousies, barren cankered gusts), your <b>main</b> <b>wind</b> blowing.

60|$|Now {{in the big}} {{silence of}} the snow is born, perhaps, not {{a little of that}} New England {{conscience}} which her children write about. There is much time to think, and thinking is a highly dangerous business. Conscience, fear, undigested reading, and, it may be, not too well cooked food, have full swing. A man, and more particularly a woman, can easily hear strange voices--the Word of the Lord rolling between the dead hills; may see visions and dream dreams; get revelations and an outpouring of the spirit, and end (such things have been) lamentably enough in those big houses by the Connecticut River which have been tenderly christened The Retreat. Hate breeds as well as religion--the deep, instriking hate between neighbours, that is born of a hundred little things added up, brooded over, and hatched by the stove when two or three talk together in the long evenings. It would be very interesting to get the statistics of revivals and murders, and find how many of them have been committed in the spring. But for undistracted people winter is one long delight of the eye. In other lands one knows the snow as a nuisance that comes and goes, and is sorely man-handled and messed at the last. Here it lies longer on the ground than any crop--from November to April sometimes--and for three months life goes to the tune of sleigh-bells, which are not, as a Southern visitor once hinted, ostentation, but safeguards. The man who drives without them is not loved. The snow is a faithful barometer, foretelling good sleighing or stark confinement to barracks. It is all the manure the stony pastures receive; it cloaks the ground and prevents the frost bursting pipes; it is the best--I had almost written the only--road-maker in the States. On the other side it can rise up in the night and bid the people sit still as the Egyptians. It can stop mails; wipe out all time-tables; extinguish the lamps of twenty towns, and kill man within sight of his own door-step or hearing of his cattle unfed. No one who has been through even so modified a blizzard as New England can produce talks lightly of the snow. Imagine eight-and-forty hours of roaring wind, the thermometer well down towards zero, scooping and gouging across a hundred miles of newly fallen snow. The air is full of stinging shot, and at ten yards the trees are invisible. The foot slides on a reef, polished and black as obsidian, where the wind has skinned an exposed corner of road down to the dirt ice of early winter. The next step ends hip-deep and over, for here an unseen wall is banking back the rush of the singing drifts. A scarped slope rises sheer across the road. The wind shifts a point or two, and all sinks down, like sand in the hour-glass, leaving a pot-hole of whirling whiteness. There is a lull, {{and you can see the}} surface of the fields settling furiously in one direction--a tide that spurts from between the tree-boles. The hollows of the pasture fill while you watch; empty, fill, and discharge anew. The rock-ledges show the bare flank of a storm-chased liner for a moment, and whitening, duck under. Irresponsible snow-devils dance by the lee of a barn where three gusts meet, or stagger out into the open till they are cut down by the <b>main</b> <b>wind.</b> At the worst of the storm there is neither Heaven nor Earth, but only a swizzle into which a man may be brewed. Distances grow to nightmare scale, and that which in the summer was no more than a minute's bare-headed run, is half an hour's gasping struggle, each foot won between the lulls. Then do the heavy-timbered barns talk like ships in a cross-sea, beam working against beam. The winter's hay is ribbed over with long lines of snow dust blown between the boards, and far below in the byre the oxen clash their horns and moan uneasily.|$|E
50|$|A {{split-phase}} motor has {{a secondary}} startup winding that is 90 electrical {{degrees to the}} <b>main</b> <b>winding,</b> always centered directly between the poles of the <b>main</b> <b>winding,</b> and connected to the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> {{by a set of}} electrical contacts. The coils of this winding are wound with fewer turns of smaller wire than the <b>main</b> <b>winding,</b> so it has a lower inductance and higher resistance. The position of the winding creates a small phase shift between the flux of the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> and the flux of the starting winding, causing the rotor to rotate. When the speed of the motor is sufficient to overcome the inertia of the load, the contacts are opened automatically by a centrifugal switch or electric relay. The direction of rotation is determined by the connection between the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> and the start circuit. In applications where the motor requires a fixed rotation, one end of the start circuit is permanently connected to the <b>main</b> <b>winding,</b> with the contacts making the connection at the other end.|$|R

50|$|The motor which {{drives the}} fan {{and the oil}} pump is usually a {{capacitor}} start motor. It is a vortex shortage tank motor because it also contains a short cage or cage holds. The difference with a three-phase motor is in the stator. Where the vortex power motor has three coils aligned at 120° in the stator, the capacitor start motor holds one <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> and one auxiliary winding aligned at 90°. The phase shift of 90° between the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> and the auxiliary winding is achieved by a connected capacitor which feeds the auxiliary winding and is connected on the single-phase AC mains. The capacitor will achieve a phase shift of 90° between the main and the auxiliary winding, producing an acceptable initial torque. This motor is intended for continuous operation.|$|R

50|$|The {{captain of}} a steam ship {{naturally}} chooses the shortest route to his destination. Since a sailing ship is usually pushed by winds and currents, its captain {{must find a}} route where the wind will probably blow in the right direction. Tacking, i.e. using contrary wind to pull (sic) the sails, was always possible but wasted time because of the zigzagging required, and this would significantly delay long voyages. The early European explorers were not only looking for new lands. They also had to discover the pattern of winds and currents that would carry them where they wanted to go. During the age of sail winds and currents determined trade routes and therefore influenced European imperialism and modern political geography.

The aim of the auxiliary winding is to create the rotating electromagnetic field when the machine is started-up and is afterwards turned off, generally through the centrifugal switch coupled together with the shaft of the machine rotor.

For this purpose, two different kinds of windings were carried out and simulated, with the proposal to obtain some benefits.

50|$|After {{the end of}} the Würm Ice Age (about 9650 BC) {{the water}} level of Lake Constance was at about 405 m above the current sea level, or about 10 metres above the present level. Back then, the Seerhein valley was {{submerged}} and Lake Constance was a single lake. Deep erosion of the Rhine then lowered the lake to its current level (about 395 m). The Seerhein valley fell dry; the Upper and Lower were Lake separated, and the Seerhein emerged as the connection between the two lakes. The course of the present Seerhein may well correspond to the location of the current in the days when Lake Constance was a single lake. The former extent of the lake is indicated by typical lake deposits; in the Seerhein valley, such deposits are found all over the valley floor. These lake sediments usually have a thickness of 0.2 to 2 metres, near the Seerhein up to 13 metres. In the western part of today's depression, the surf of the lake formed many beach ridges perpendicular to the <b>main</b> <b>wind</b> direction (southwest); ridges in the Wollmatinger Ried are still well preserved. Besides the described main elements (Würm moraine, Ice Lake sediments, Lake deposits, including the beach ridges), Pleistocene talus and Holocene alluvial fan are found in Seerhein basin.|$|E
5000|$|Analytical studies, {{performed}} on the rock by the Curiosity rover in October 2012, suggest the Jake M rock is an igneous rock but found to be high in elements consistent with feldspar, such as sodium, aluminum and potassium, and lower concentrations of magnesium, iron and nickel than other such rocks previously found on Mars. [...] The mineral content and elemental abundance indicates Jake M rock may be a mugearite, a sodium rich oligoclase-bearing basaltic trachyandesite. Igneous rocks similar to the Jake M rock are well known but occur rarely on Earth. On Earth, such rocks form when magma, usually found in volcanoes, rises to the surface, cools and partially solidifies with certain chemical elements, while the warmer liquid magma portion becomes enriched with the left-behind elements. By remarkable coincidence, the Martian locality Glenelg is also {{the name of a}} small settlement in north-west Scotland that is 25 km east of type locality for mugearite at Mugeary on the island of Skye. The Jake M rock is a ventifact with a volcanic fabric. Its pyramidal shape was formed by eolian drifted grains of sand. The little cavities on its surface were formed by the blast-effect, which is caused by different flow dynamics at the micro-relief. On the surface one could see the marks of the <b>main</b> <b>wind</b> direction, by which Jake M was formed. On September 27, 2013, NASA scientists reported that Jake M rock was a mugearite and very similar to terrestrial mugearite rocks.|$|E

50|$|A {{capacitor}} with {{a relatively}} low capacitance, and relatively high voltage rating, is connected in series with the start winding and remains in the circuit during the entire run cycle. Like other split-phase motors, the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> is used with a smaller start winding, and rotation is changed by reversing {{the connection between the}} <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> and the start circuit. There are significant differences, however; the use of a speed sensitive centrifugal switch requires that other split-phase motors must operate at, or very close to, full speed. PSC motors may operate within a wide range of speeds, much lower than the motor's electrical speed. Also, for applications like automatic door openers that require the motor to reverse rotation often, the use of a mechanism requires that a motor must slow to a near stop before contact with the start winding is re-established. The 'permanent' connection to the capacitor in a PSC motor means that changing rotation is instantaneous.|$|R

40|$|Making {{the simple}} model {{test of the}} full circle typed sprinkler, I found that the {{phenomenon}} of the high distribution parts took place at right angles to the <b>main</b> <b>wind</b> direction passing through the nozzle at the wind speed of about 2 - 3 m/sec. In order to make this growth mechanism clear, I made a sprinkling test with a main nozzle which was the motive power of a sprinkler. Comparatively high distribution parts grew {{on both sides of the}} <b>main</b> <b>wind</b> direction passing through the nozzle at the wind speed of 1 m/sec and a horseshoe-shaped equal distribution line appeared in the sprinkler distribution chart. Besides the dent was found to be divided into two parts at right angles to the <b>main</b> <b>wind</b> direction, with the increase of the wind speed. Considering the sprinkler distribution chart of the main and the sub nozzles, their influences from the wind were proved to be canceled each other. After all the wind was the main cause of the growth of the high distribution parts. In view of the nozzle the jet water of the main nozzle was most effected by the wind, and the important factor of the growth of the high distribution parts. Carrying out the sprinkling test of right angle range with the part circle typed sprinkler which has never been experimented yet and especially examine the influence of the wind, I could make its characteristic clear. Next I carried out the experiment of this sprinkler together with the full circle typed one and proved that it secured a pretty good charactor of equality even at the wind of 3 m/sec as I mentioned above I studied the sprinkling characteristic of the sprinklers unlike in the quality of jet water and the type...|$|E
