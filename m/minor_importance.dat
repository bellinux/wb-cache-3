5|$|In 1892 Piłsudski {{returned}} from exile {{and settled in}} Adomavas Manor near Teneniai (now in Šilalė district). In 1893 he joined the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) and helped organize its Lithuanian branch. Initially he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible internationalism he remained a Polish nationalist. In 1894, as its chief editor, he began publishing an underground socialist newspaper, Robotnik (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers, and, initially, a typesetter. In 1895 he became a PPS leader, and took the position that doctrinal issues were of <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> and that socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology, since that combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.|$|E
5|$|Once a vote occurred, and {{a measure}} passed, {{he could do}} nothing, since his promise to {{physically}} interpose his person against the senators was now meaningless. In addition, during a couple of instances {{between the end of}} the Second Punic War in 201 BC {{and the beginning of the}} Social War in 91 BC, although they had no legal power to do so, several Consuls were known to have vetoed acts of the Senate. Ultimately, if there was no veto, and the matter was of <b>minor</b> <b>importance,</b> it could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands. If there was no veto, and the matter was of a significant nature, there was usually a physical division of the house, where senators voted by taking a place on either side of the chamber.|$|E
5|$|In {{their native}} habitat, all Amylostereum species have a <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> as forest pests. The {{infestation}} through wood wasps does not assume greater dimensions and is, {{compared with other}} pests, almost insignificant. The infection rates are even lower during sexual reproduction via fruit bodies, as the wasps do not {{play a part in}} the process. Furthermore, the Amylostereum fungi are alone often incapable of infesting healthy trees. They thus mostly act as saprobiontics. Pine monocultures in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America were shown to be susceptible to the Sirex woodwasp (Sirex noctilio), which was introduced there and which is associated with A.areolatum. The wasp's phytotoxic secretion, its larvae and the fungus combine very effectively with each other and contribute to forest decline rates of up to 80%. This is mainly owing to the poor water and nutrient supply of the trees, which can poorly reconcile the drought stress caused by infestation. S.noctilio was detected in North America in the 2000s (decade); in Canada alone, the total economic loss to the forestry industry caused by the Sirex–Amylostereum symbiosis could be as high as $254 million per year for the next 20 years.|$|E

25|$|In essence, {{the main}} {{characteristic}} of this formative period {{is the assumption}} by the community of a larger authority {{at the expense of}} the elites, reflected in the <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> of prestige items production, while the collective invested important resources and labour in the communal spaces and defences.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} of <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> to local {{fisheries}} throughout its range, {{and is also}} considered a good game fish, especially in larger sizes. The species is rarely targeted by anglers though, due to its comparative rarity. The fish also fetches high prices at market, unlike many {{other members of the}} Carangidae.|$|E
25|$|The bumpnose trevally, Carangoides hedlandensis (also {{known as}} the bumpnose {{kingfish}} and onion kingfish) is a species of relatively small inshore marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The bumpnose trevally is fairly common in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-west Pacific region, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan and Samoa in the east. It is a small species by carangid standards, reaching a maximum known length of 32cm, and can be distinguished from the similarly shaped Carangoides armatus by a distinct 'bump' on the snout, which gives the fish its common name. The species inhabits coastal waters, often living along bays and beaches, where it takes shrimp, small crabs, and juvenile fish as prey. The bumpnose trevally is of <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> to fisheries throughout its range, taken by hook and line, trawls, and seine nets. It is also of <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> to anglers, taken by baits from beaches and piers, and is considered a modest table fish.|$|E

25|$|Long {{before the}} war was over, privateering could be evaluated, and clearly it was of <b>minor</b> <b>importance.</b> Only a handful of vessels fell victim, and these were {{balanced}} by losses of the privateers themselves. Two attempts at privateering on the west coast, the J. M. Chapman Plot {{and that of the}} Salvador Pirates resulted in capture and trials for piracy.|$|E
25|$|Several other isomers of {{anthraquinone}} are possible, {{including the}} 1,2-, 1,4-, and 2,6-anthraquinones. They are of comparatively <b>minor</b> <b>importance.</b> The term {{is also used}} in the more general sense of any compound that {{can be viewed as}} an anthraquinone with some hydrogen atoms replaced by other atoms or functional groups. These derivatives include substances that are technically useful or play important roles in living beings.|$|E
25|$|The longnose {{trevally}} is of <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> to fisheries {{throughout its}} range, taken by hook and line, bottom trawls, gill nets and {{various types of}} trap. It is usually sold fresh, and is often not distinguished from other species of carangid. The species is occasionally caught by boat anglers, as well as beach fishermen on the South African coast. They take small baits and are considered good for eating.|$|E

25|$|Although Athens and Attica {{were also}} ethnically Ionian, the Ionic order was of <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> in this area. The Temple of Nike Aptera on the Acropolis, a small amphiprostyle temple {{completed}} around 420 BC, with Ionic columns on plinthless Attic bases, a triple-layered architrave and a figural frieze, {{but without the}} typical Ionic dentil, is notable. The east and north halls of the Erechtheion, completed in 406 BC, follow the same succession of elements.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-six of {{the fifty}} broad {{mangrove}} types {{found in the}} world grow well in the Sundarbans. The commonly identifiable vegetation that grow in the dense mangrove forests at the Sundarbans are salt water mixed forest, mangrove scrub, brackish water mixed forest, littoral forest, wet forest and wet alluvial grass forests. The Bangladesh mangrove vegetation of the Sundarbans differs greatly from other non-deltaic coastal mangrove forests and upland forests associations. Unlike the former, the Rhizophoraceae are of <b>minor</b> <b>importance.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dietary {{factors such}} as spice consumption, were {{hypothesized}} to cause ulcers {{until late in the}} 20th century, but {{have been shown to be}} of relatively <b>minor</b> <b>importance.</b> Caffeine and coffee, also commonly thought to cause or exacerbate ulcers, appear to have little effect. Similarly, while studies have found that alcohol consumption increases risk when associated with H. pylori infection, it does not seem to independently increase risk. Even when coupled with H. pylori infection, the increase is modest in comparison to the primary risk factor.|$|E
50|$|The {{yellowtail}} trumpeter is of <b>minor</b> commercial <b>importance</b> {{throughout its}} range, caught with handlines, seines, and other inshore fishing gear.

50|$|The bulk of its diet {{includes}} zooplankton, insects, crustaceans, algae, and detritus. It is of <b>minor</b> commercial <b>importance,</b> {{primarily in}} China, {{where it is}} canned. In Hong Kong, it is not favored as a table fish because the flesh is unpalatable and very bony.|$|R
25|$|In 1521 Luther was outlawed at the Diet of Worms. But the Reformation spread rapidly, {{helped by}} the Emperor Charles V's wars with France and the Turks. Hiding in the Wartburg Castle, Luther {{translated}} the Bible from Latin to German, establishing {{the basis of the}} German language. A curious fact is that Luther spoke a dialect which had <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> in the German language of that time. After the publication of his Bible, his dialect suppressed the others and evolved into what is now the modern German.|$|E
25|$|The blacktip {{trevally}} is of <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> {{to commercial}} fisheries throughout its range, taken by hook and line and various netting methods, {{from where it}} is sold fresh, salted or dried at market. The species is considered a good gamefish and can be taken by fish or squid baits as well as various patterns of lure and fly. When taken from the water, the fish often 'grunt' in similar manner to a young pig. They are considered an excellent table fish despite being {{known to be a}} host to parasitic infection in some regions.|$|E
25|$|Rockwell {{transferred}} {{from high school}} to the Chase Art School at the age of 14. He then went on to the National Academy of Design and finally to the Art Students League. There, he was taught by Thomas Fogarty, George Bridgman, and Frank Vincent DuMond; his early works were produced for St. Nicholas Magazine, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) publication Boys' Life, and other youth publications. As a student, Rockwell was given small jobs of <b>minor</b> <b>importance.</b> His first major breakthrough came at age 18 with his first book illustration for Carl H. Claudy's Tell Me Why: Stories about Mother Nature.|$|E
