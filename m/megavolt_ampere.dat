40|$|With the {{deregulation}} of electrical energy production and distribution, says Boldea (Polytechnical Institute, Timisoara, Romania) producers {{are looking for}} ways to tailor their electricity for different markets. Variable-speed electric generators are serving that purpose, up to the 400 <b>megavolt</b> <b>ampere</b> unit size, in Japan since 1996 and Germany sin...|$|E
40|$|A {{morphological}} decimation {{technique has}} been proposed and implemented to analyze the available power transfer capability in a transmission power network. The method creates a graphical image of the power network with thickness of the lines proportional to their respective rated <b>megavolt</b> <b>ampere</b> (MVA) capacity. Based on ac load flow solution, another image was created to represent the power flow in Megawatt (MW) between the buses. Proper scaling procedure has been discussed {{for the construction of}} graphical images. The novelty of this research lies in the application of mathematical morphological techniques for decimating the created images. The image created for the MW capacities of the power lines were decimated into categories and grouped into different colors for better visualization. The multi-color image is superimposed on the input image which is created for the MVA capacity of the network. The proposed method has been tested on an IEEE test system. The results from the present approach can help the planner and operator in a power station, to get a better visualization of the power network. This is the first time this kind of multi-color visualization is presented and {{it can be used to}} find the optimal path for power transfer from one bus to another...|$|E
50|$|Each turbine {{is rated}} at 339 MW at a 137 m {{head and a}} speed of 133.33 rpm. The {{generators}} are rated at 370 <b>megavolt</b> <b>amperes</b> (MVA), which is increased to 390 MVA in the winter.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} 3 -D model for calculating {{magnetic}} fields {{in a power}} transformer and the effective parameters (inductance and resistance) of its windings. The transformer is representative of large transformers with power ratings ranging from hundreds of kilovolt amperes to hundreds of <b>megavolt</b> <b>amperes.</b> The model accounts for anisotropic frequency-dependent properties of the laminated transformercore and eddy currents in the steel sheets. We discuss {{the results of the}} calculations performed in the frequency range 10 Hzâ€“ 10 MHz, and show that the largest variations of both the magnetic field and parameters of the windings take place at frequencies below 10 kHz and, at frequencies higher than 1 MHz, the magnetic core does not significantly affect the variation of the effective parameters...|$|R
