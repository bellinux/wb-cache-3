25|$|Operating systems {{targeting}} Java <b>ME</b> <b>have</b> {{been implemented}} by DoCoMo {{in the form}} of DoJa, and by SavaJe as SavaJe OS. The latter company was purchased by Sun in April 2007 and now forms the basis of Sun's JavaFX Mobile. The company IS2T provides a Java ME virtual machine (MicroJvm) for any RTOS and even with no RTOS (then qualified as baremetal). When baremetal, the virtual machine is the OS/RTOS: the device boots in Java.|$|E
25|$|The {{platform}} {{uses the}} object-oriented Java programming language. It {{is part of}} the Java software-platform family. Java ME was designed by Sun Microsystems, acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010; the platform replaced a similar technology, PersonalJava. Originally developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 68, the different flavors of Java <b>ME</b> <b>have</b> evolved in separate JSRs. Oracle provides a reference implementation of the specification, but has tended not to provide free binary implementations of its Java ME runtime environment for mobile devices, rather relying on third parties to provide their own.|$|E

500|$|Many Democrats were incensed at McCarthy's {{attack on}} the State Department of a Democratic administration, and had hoped to use the {{hearings}} to discredit him. The Democratic chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Millard Tydings, {{was reported to have}} said, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>have</b> him [...] for three days in public hearings, and he'll never show his face in the Senate again." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{the mid-1990s}} Kirchherr and {{business}} partner Krüger have operated the K photography shop in Hamburg, offering custom vintage prints, books and artwork for sale. K periodically helps arrange Beatles' conventions and other Beatles' {{events in the}} Hamburg area. She has no children, and now lives alone: [...] ""My [...] marriage ended in 1985... I regretted I had no children. I just couldn't see <b>me</b> <b>have</b> [...] any. But now I am pleased when I see the situation the world is in. I live alone and am very happy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Blow" [...] {{was written}} by Kesha {{alongside}} Klas Åhlund, Lukasz Gottwald, Alan Grigg, Benjamin Levin and Max Martin. Production of the song was completed by Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Benny Blanco and Kool Kojak. According to Kesha the line [...] "We’re taking over" [...] is representative of herself and her fans, which she explained during an interview with Beatweek Magazine, [...] "I love that I say ‘we’re taking over’ in it because my fans and <b>me</b> <b>have</b> started a cult. We’re misfits of society but we’ve banded together and we’re starting a revolution. We are taking over. So get used to it." ...|$|E

500|$|On December 16, 1956, American Broadcasting Company {{president}} Oliver E. Treyz announced Aubrey {{would immediately}} become the network's head of programming and talent. [...] ABC, the weakest {{of the three}} networks, was a perennial also-ran with a weak roster of affiliates and programs, something comparable to {{the early days of}} the Fox Network. Aubrey later said [...] "at that time, there was no ABC. The headquarters was an old riding stable. But I went because [...] Leonard Goldenson in effect said, 'Look, I don't know that much about TV, I'm a lawyer.' And he let <b>me</b> <b>have</b> autonomy." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after Stefani joined No Doubt, she and bandmate Tony Kanal began dating: {{she stated}} {{that she was}} heavily {{invested}} in that relationship. Stefani commented that [...] "...all I ever did was look at Tony and pray that God would let <b>me</b> <b>have</b> a baby with him." [...] During this time, the band almost split up because of the failed romantic relationship between Stefani and Kanal. Kanal ended the relationship. Their break-up inspired Stefani lyrically, and many of Tragic Kingdoms songs, such as [...] "Don't Speak", [...] "Sunday Morning", and [...] "Hey You!", chronicle {{the ups and downs}} of their relationship.|$|E
500|$|James was {{the first}} {{documented}} African-American woman {{to come to the}} Utah Territory as a Mormon pioneer. [...] The family's first years in the valley were difficult: they lived in poverty and often did not even have the barest essentials for survival. Nevertheless, James exhibited remarkable charity and strength of character. In 1849, Eliza Lyman, a neighbor of hers, had no food to sustain her and her children until the harvest after she sent her husband on a mission to California. She records that [...] "Not long after Amasa had gone, Jane James, the colored woman, let <b>me</b> <b>have</b> two pounds of flour, it being half of what she had." ...|$|E

500|$|Her first project {{there was}} to reprise her role as Clear Rivers in the sequel to Final Destination {{entitled}} Final Destination 2. In an interview with IGN, Larter explained her return to the franchise: [...] "When New Line {{asked me to come}} back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and let <b>me</b> <b>have</b> some input, and it was really terrific." [...] The film made US$90 million worldwide, to a mixed critical reception. A year later, Larter served as an associate producer of and starred in the thriller Three Way, and in 2005, she appeared in the independent political thriller Confess, and had a role in the romantic comedy A Lot Like Love, starring Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher.|$|E
500|$|In 1879, Sullivan, Gilbert and Carte were in {{the midst}} of a legal battle with the former {{directors}} of the Comedy Opera Company, which had produced H.M.S. Pinafore. Sullivan wrote to Hollingshead, saying: [...] "You once settled a precedent for me which may just at present be of great importance to me. I asked you for the band parts of the Merry Wives of Windsor... and [...] said, 'They are yours, as our run is over....' Now will you please let <b>me</b> <b>have</b> them, and the parts of Thespis also at once. I am detaining the parts of Pinafore, so that the directors shall not take them away from the Comique tomorrow, and I base my claim on the precedent you set." ...|$|E
500|$|Chan's {{character}} has also {{come under fire}} for [...] "nuggets of fortune cookie Confucius" [...] and the [...] "counterfeit proverbs" [...] which became so widespread in popular culture. The Biggers novels did not introduce the [...] "Confucius say" [...] proverbs, which were added in the films, but one novel features Chan remarking: [...] "As all those who know <b>me</b> <b>have</b> learned to their distress, Chinese have proverbs to fit every possible situation." [...] Huang Yunte gives as examples [...] "Tongue often hang man quicker than rope," [...] "Mind,like parachute, only function when open," [...] and [...] "Man who flirt with dynamite sometime fly with angels." [...] He argues, however, that these [...] "colorful aphorisms" [...] display [...] "amazing linguistic acrobatic skills." [...] Like the African American [...] "signifying monkey," [...] Huang continues, Chan [...] "imparts as much insult as wisdom." ...|$|E

500|$|The Manfred Symphony {{would cost}} Tchaikovsky more time, effort and soul-searching than {{anything}} else he would write, even the Pathetique Symphony. It also became the longest, most complex work he had written up to that point, and though it owes an obvious debt to Berlioz due to its program, Tchaikovsky {{was still able to}} make the theme of Manfred his own. Near the end of seven months of intensive effort, in late September 1885, he wrote Balakirev, [...] "Never in my life, believe <b>me,</b> <b>have</b> I labored so long and hard, and felt so drained by my efforts. The Symphony is written in four movements, as per your program, although—forgive me—as much as I wanted to, I {{have not been able to}} keep all the keys and modulations you suggested ... It is of course dedicated to you".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava, who directed Beyoncé's videos, [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Baby Boy". The video is inspired by the dancing of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in the 1953 musical comedy film, The Band Wagon and has a Studio 54 style. Paired with Usher, Beyoncé dances seductively and flirts with him to portray a naughty girl. She {{felt that they were}} a [...] "perfect match" [...] for the dancing scenes in the video. According to Usher, the video is a homage to classic [...] "ultimate entertainers"; including dancers, singers and actors. He further talked about the collaboration on the video, saying, [...] "Beyoncé and <b>me</b> <b>have</b> been talking about doing a record together. She reached out to me and said she had an idea and really wanted me to be the lead in her video... I was like, 'Well let me hear the idea.' It sounded like something totally different than what had been on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{protagonist of}} the prior film, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), was killed {{off-screen}} in the film. Rumors indicated that Sawa had a contract dispute with New Line concerning the deduction of his salary; however, Perry resolved {{the issue with}} the statement that [...] "it had everything to do with narrative, and nothing to do with money or Devon’s unwillingness to come back." [...] Despite this, New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers. [...] "When New Line asked me to come back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and let <b>me</b> <b>have</b> some input, and it was really terrific," [...] Larter revealed. Larter indicated that Clear [...] " [...] gotten to a hardened place and tucked herself inside because she has felt so much pain in her life. By having herself committed to a mental hospital, she has created a safehouse so that Death can't get her." [...] Tony Todd also resumed his character as mortician William Bludworth. [...] "It’s the same character that we saw before that the audience loved," [...] Ellis expressed.|$|E

500|$|On May 29, Conley {{was interviewed}} for four hours. His new {{affidavit}} said that Frank told him, [...] "he {{had picked up}} a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something." [...] Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two {{had returned to the}} office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>have</b> that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens." [...] Conley's affidavit concluded, [...] "The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help me out and I decided to tell the whole truth about this matter." [...] At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.|$|E
500|$|The track [...] "Old Age", whose organ intro was {{featured}} on the band's cover of [...] "Credit In The Straight World" [...] from Live Through This, was revealed to have originally written by Kurt Cobain; Love stated in a 1997 interview that [...] "Old Age" [...] was [...] "partly someone else's composition. It's something somebody {{had a little bit}} of and I said 'let <b>me</b> <b>have</b> the rest of it' and I wrote this thing in it and tried to make it goth. I found it, wrote it, and recorded it the same night." [...] It was later revealed that a version of the song was recorded by Nirvana during the Nevermind (1991) recording sessions, but Cobain threw the song out, later giving the melody to Love, who rearranged musical pieces and rewrote the lyrics. Two live cover versions were included on the album: [...] "Season of the Witch" [...] by Donovan, and [...] "He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)", which was written by Carole King and recorded by The Crystals in the 1960s. Love referred to it as a [...] "feminist anthem" [...] after performing it during MTV Unplugged in 1995.|$|E
500|$|The two Dudley {{brothers}} {{were on the}} closest personal terms and Ambrose said of Robert: [...] "there is no man [...] knoweth his doings better than I myself", while Robert's recurrent phrase about Ambrose was: [...] "him I love as myself". Elizabeth, who liked Warwick, loved to joke that he was neither as graceful nor as handsome as his brotherand stouter as well. Lacking a grand London residence of his own, Warwick had his suite of rooms in the palatial Leicester House: [...] "the Lord of Warwick's bedchamber, the Lord of Warwick's closet, the Lord of Warwick's dining parlour". In the administration of their lands the brothers shared their estate managers and lawyers, while their local affinities consisted of the same gentry families. Privately, they were [...] "almost inseparable", passing time together whenever possible. When Robert Dudley had incurred the Queen's wrath while serving in the Netherlands as Governor-General in 1586, Ambrose wrote to him: [...] "if I were you ... I {{would go to the}} furthest part of Christendom rather than ever come into England again. ... Let <b>me</b> <b>have</b> your best advice what is best for me to do, for that I mean to take such part as you do." ...|$|E
