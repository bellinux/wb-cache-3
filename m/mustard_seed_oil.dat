50|$|The {{traditional}} {{sources of}} fatty alcohols {{have largely been}} various vegetable oils and these remain a large-scale feedstock. Animal fats (tallow) were of historic importance, particularly whale oil, however {{they are no longer}} used on a large scale. Tallows produce a fairly narrow range of alcohols, predominantly C16-C18, the chain lengths from plant sources are more variable (C6-C24) making them the preferred source. The alcohols are obtained from the triglycerides (fatty acid triesters), which form the bulk of the oil. The process involves the transesterification of the triglycerides to give methyl esters which are then hydrogenated to give the fatty alcohols. Higher alcohols (C20-C22) can be obtained from rapeseed oil or <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil.</b> Midcut alcohols are obtained from coconut oil (C12-C14) or palm kernel oil (C16-C18).|$|E

40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay for {{the detection}} of mustard protein was developed. The assay is based on a polyclonal antiserum directed against a mixture of mustard proteins raised in rabbits. The assay has a detection limit of 1. 5 ppm (milligrams per kilogram) and is suitable {{for the detection of}} traces of mustard protein in mustard seed-derived flavoring ingredients. Limited cross-reactivity testing showed that no other plant proteins reacted significantly. From the animal proteins tested, only milk showed some cross-reactivity. With this sensitive assay, it was shown that refined <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> produced by steam distillation does not contain detectable amounts of mustard protein. <b>Mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> is used as a flavoring in very low quantities, typically between 40 and 200 mg/kg. Thus, 100 g of a food product flavored with 200 mg of <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> per kg containing < 1. 5 mg of protein per kg would represent an amount of mustard seed protein of < 30 ng. Taking into account the published literature on allergic reactions to the unintended ingestion of mustard, this conservatively low calculated level indicates that it is unlikely that food products containing <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> as a flavoring ingredient will elicit an allergic reaction in mustard-allergic individuals.

40|$|High erucic <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common liquid cooking oil in India and Nepal. Roasting of seed prior to oil {{extraction}} is a common practice in these areas. This study was carried out to evaluate the oxidative stability of the roasted <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil.</b> At first, a potent radical scavenger formed during seed roasting was isolated and identified based on NMR, MS, UV and fluorescence spectra. The compound was found to be 2, 6 -dimethoxy- 4 -vinylphenol (also known as canolol) and was confirmed by chemical synthesis. The compound was isolated for the first time from roasted high erucic <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil.</b> It was previously observed in the roasted low erucic mustard and rapeseed oil. Furthermore, the oxidative stability of the different <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> samples collected from Nepalese market was evaluated. The different samples showed varying degree of oxidative stability and some samples were remarkably stable even for 2 months at 50 oC (dark). The differences in the oxidative stability among samples were only slightly correlated with the concentration of radical scavengers. Further study revealed that browning reaction markers (absorbance at 330 to 430 nm and fluorescence emission at 450 nm after excitation at 350 nm) showed high correlation with the oxidative stability. The browning reaction products were lipophilic, which indicated the possible involvement of lipids in the Maillard type reactions. The phospholipids content showed high correlation with both the browning reaction markers and the oxidative stability. This showed that the presence of phospholipids along with its possible browning reaction products (mainly due to amino group containing phospholipids) during heat treatments could play important synergistic role with canolol and tocopherols on the oxidative stability of the roasted <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare the fatty acid composition of commercially available edible oils derived from certified organic and conventional agricultural methods. A total of 59 certified organic and 53 conventional oils were purchased from retail markets in Sydney, Australia. Organic and conventional products were matched for comparison according to the description of production methods, labelled total fat content, brand name (wherever possible), and country of origin. Total fat was extracted and the fatty acid composition of the oils was determined by gas chromatography. No consistent overall trend of difference in the fatty acid composition was observed between organic and conventional oils. Saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids were all significantly different between types of oil (P < 0. 001 in all three), and each had significant interaction between type and production method (P = 0. 002, P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 001, respectively) indicating that organic and conventional oils differed in these components in an inconsistent fashion. Despite this, there were large differences particularly between MUFA and PUFA components in specific pairs of oils, especially in sunflower and <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oils.</b> The absence of an overall difference in the fatty acid composition of organic and conventional oils does not support the tenet that organic foods are of a higher nutritional quality than their conventional counterparts. 5 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This PhD thesis {{contributes}} {{to a better understanding}} of the chemistry of mustard and rapeseed oils in the field of authenticity, formation of antioxidants during roasting and their effects on the oil oxidative stability. At first, a chemometric methodology based on Monte Carlo simulation was developed to evaluate the authenticity of mustard and rapeseed oils. In the second part, the isolation of a potent radical scavenger, canolol, from the roasted <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> was carried out and its identity was confirmed via spectrometric data (NMR, UV, MS) and chemical synthesis. Canolol was found to be formed during seed roasting by decarboxylation of sinapic acid. In the third part, the oxidative stability of roasted and unroasted mustard seed oils collected from the Nepalese market was evaluated. Furthermore, the effects of seed roasting on the oxidative stability of mustard and rapeseed oils was investigated. These studies showed that canolol could play an important role in the oxidative stability of roasted rapeseed oil; in contrast, it could only play a limited role in the much higher oxidative stability of roasted <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil.</b> In fact, the oxidative stability of roasted <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> was mainly correlated with the phospholipid content and the Maillard type browning reaction products formed during roasting. At last, the Maillard type reactions involving phospholipids and their antioxidant potential were evaluated in a model system containing phosphatidylethanolamine and glucose. The reaction products not only increased the oil oxidative stability but also increased the stability of tocopherol and plastochromanol- 8 during oil storage. The occurrence of such reactions in an apolar medium was demonstrated by identifying some of the reaction products by liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF MS). Such antioxidants could find a wide application in different food products...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to explore the {{possible}} mechanisms behind the high oxidative stability of roasted <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil.</b> A potent radical scavenger formed during mustard seed roasting was isolated and identified based on nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet and fluorescence spectra. The compound {{was found to be}} 2, 6 -dimethoxy- 4 -vinylphenol (canolol) and was confirmed by chemical synthesis. The oxidative stability of the sixteen different crude roasted <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> samples collected from the Nepalese market was evaluated by monitoring the peroxide value (PV) and conjugated diene (CD) during storage at 50 oC (in dark). These samples showed a wide variability in the oxidative stability. Some of the samples were shown to be highly stable even after 69 days of storage reaching PV less than 9 meq oxygen/kg fat. The oxidative stability of the different samples (PV after 40 days of storage (PV 40) as an index) was not significantly correlated (p > 0. 05) with both the sum of the tocopherols and canolol content of the oil and the total radical scavenging activity of the oil using the DPPH assay. On the other hand, the PV 40 was negatively correlated with the absorbance at 350 nm (p < 0. 001), fluorescence (excitation at 350 nm and emission at 440 nm) (p < 0. 001), phospholipid content (p < 0. 001), pyrrolized phospholipid content (p < 0. 01) and canolol content (p < 0. 01). Moreover, phospholipid content, fluorescence, pyrrolized phospholipid content and absorbance at 350 nm were highly positively correlated (p < 0. 001) with each other. The phospholipids and its Maillard type browning reaction products together with canolol were primarily responsible for the high oxidative stability of the roasted <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> samples...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} special {{aspects of}} accumulation of inorganic elements including heavy metals in seeds {{of white and}} black mustard to be grown for obtaining drugs. Methods. Field experiments, microwave digestion, ICP-MS and statistical analysis. Results. The content of inorganic elements including heavy metals was determined in the seeds of white and black mustard grown in Kiev Oblast. It was revealed that {{during the growing season}} plants of white mustard were able to accumulate such elements as aluminum, barium, strontium, zinc in seeds in concentrations that exceed their content in black mustard seeds, while compounds of calcium, cesium, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium in a greater degree were accumulated in black mustard seeds. Conclusions. As legal and regulatory documents for important chemical elements don’t contain the maximum permissible limits of their content in medicinal plants, it would make sense to launch a comprehensive research with the involvement of specia­lists of relevant profiles in order to establish such a gradation. Plants of white and black mustard in Kiev Oblast have accumulated high levels of such metals as Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Sr, Zn that exceed the known limits of accumulation, indicating a partial contamination of soils in the region.
