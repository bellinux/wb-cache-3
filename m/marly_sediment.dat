40|$|International audienceAims In eroded {{lands of}} the French Southern Alps, burial of early {{established}} seedlings under <b>marly</b> <b>sediment</b> weakens the effect of vegetation on soil stabilization and sediment trapping. Therefore, this protective role is largely dependent on species ' resistance to burial, and the understanding of species ' tolerance to this environmental disturbance is highly valuable for basic knowledge on plant succession and for ecological restoration purposes. Methods The response of five woody species with contrasting ecological requirements and natural habitats—three tree species, Pinus nigra, Robinia pseudoacacia and Acer campestre, and two shrubs, Ononis fruticosa and Hippophae rhamnoides—to experimental burial under <b>marly</b> <b>sediment</b> was studied. Seedlings were exposed to three burial levels : no burial (control), partial burial (50 % of seedling height) and complete burial (100 % of seedling height). Burial tolerance was evaluated based on seedling survival, height and biomass. Biomass allocation to shoots and roots and soluble sugar and starch contents in roots and stems were measured to identify plant traits that determine species response to burial. Important Findings All species survived partial burial but only A. campestre seedlings emerged from complete burial. Tree species were more tolerant to burial and buried plants showed no significant differences with control. The two shrubs were found less tolerant and buried plants showed slower growth than controls. The results showed that species response {{was not related to}} initial soluble and starch content in roots and stems, but instead to biomass allocation pattern flexibility.

40|$|Hydroclastite {{beds are}} {{interbedded}} with pillow lavas in an overturned section exposed near Acicastello, on the Ionian coast of Sicily. Two distinct hydroclastite facies are recognized {{in a continuous}} 15 -m section in a cliff face overlying pillow lavas. The first, an hyaloclastite facies, comprises black hyaloclasts and pillow fragments, many of which retain a partial pillow shape and glassy rim, in a matrix of smaller, partially devitrified and palagonitized hyaloclasts. Beds of this facies are predominantly inversely graded, exhibit both matrix and clast support, and commonly contain outsize clasts {{at or near the}} bed top. Beds of the hyaloclastite facies beds are interpreted as the deposits of noncohesive submarine debris flows transporting fragments formed primarily by cooling-contraction granulation. The second, a pillow-fragment breccia facies, forms wedge-shaped beds that are interbedded with the hyaloclastite facies. Pillow-fragment breccias comprise non-graded breccias of basalt blocks that formed by spalling of joint blocks from pillow lavas. Beds of this facies are clast-supported and contain a matrix of <b>marly</b> <b>sediment.</b> This facies formed by accumulation of pillow fragments along the sides of pillow-lava ridges, creating wedges of talus which interfinger with the debris-flow deposits of the hyaloclastite facies...|$|E

40|$|Excellent {{exposures}} of Miocene seep-carbonates {{enclosed in}} marine <b>marly</b> <b>sediments</b> (Vicchio outcrops {{in the northern}} Apennines, Italy) offer the opportunity to highlight {{the evolution of a}} fossil seep ecosystem and the response of benthic communities to high-stressed environmental conditions. For this purpose, seep-related facies and molluscs within carbonate bodies have been studied, coupled with benthic foraminiferal assemblages and carbon and oxygen isotopes in the enclosing marls. The integrated planktonic foraminiferal and calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy has allowed us to constrain the seepage within well-calibrated bioevents and to stress the relationships with paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic variations during the middle Miocene in the Mediterranean area. Our biostratigraphic data indicate that the onset of the seepage approximates the Mi 3 b cooling event (13. 82 Ma) and the seepage system lasts for 400 kyr. The evolution of the Vicchio cold-seep system passes through four phases: (1) The onset of the seepage, characterized by a pervasive flow of methane-rich fluids, is inferred by δ 13 C depletion of <b>marly</b> <b>sediments</b> and by prevailing benthic foraminifera indicative of suboxic conditions at the sea-floor. (2) The methane flow becomes focused causing the precipitation of wide pinnacle-like carbonate bodies which contain giants lucinids. Enclosing marls indicate well-oxygenated conditions, possibly enhanced by paleoceanographic variations connected to the Mi 3 b cooling event. (3) The appearance of the vesicomyid Christineconcha cf. C. regab and the absence of lucinids in seep-carbonates suggest stable methane-rich fluid emissions; higher flow rates locally favoured the flourishment of bacterial mats. Benthic foraminifera show abundance peaks of organic matter depending taxa. (4) The reduced intensity of methane-rich fluid flows favours the precipitation of stratiform carbonate bodies along strike; the macrofauna is characterized by the presence of both Vesicomyidae and giant lucinids. Foraminiferal assemblages in the enclosing marls indicate the restoration of well-oxygenated conditions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNew {{investigations}} in the Neogene Boudinar basin (Morocco) provide {{new information about}} the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) and Zanclean reflooding {{in the southern part}} of the Alboran realm (westernmost Mediterranean). Based on a new field, sedimentological and palaeontological analyses, the age and the geometry of both the Messinian erosional surface (MES) and the overlying deposits have been determined. The MES is of late Messinian age and was emplaced in subaerial settings. In the Boudinar basin, a maximum of 200 m of Miocene sediments was eroded, including late Messinian gypsum blocks. The original geometry of the MES is preserved only when it is overlain by late Messinian continental deposits, conglomeratic alluvial fans or lacustrine <b>marly</b> <b>sediments.</b> These sediments are interpreted as indicators of the sea-level fall during the MSC. Elsewhere in the basin, the contact between late Messinian and early Pliocene deposits is a low-angle dipping, smooth surface that corresponds to the early Pliocene transgression surface that subsequently re-shaped the regressive MES. The early Pliocene deposits are characterized by: (i) their onlap onto either the basement of the Rif chain or the late Miocene deposits; (ii) lagoonal deposits at the base to offshore marls and sands at the top (earliest Pliocene; 5. 33 – 5. 04 Ma interval; foraminifer zone PL 1); (iii) marine recovery occurring in the 5. 32 – 5. 26 Ma interval; and (iv) the change from lagoonal to offshore environments occurring within deposits tens of metres thick.

We identified four main correlative events, primarily controlled by synsedimentary tectonics, sediment input and climate cooling: 1) a Burdigalian tectonic phase determined the onset of shelfal sedimentation in wedge-top areas and is correlated with an important episode of fluid expulsion in <b>marly</b> <b>sediments</b> of the inner foredeep (Croce di Moggiona seep-carbonates); 2) the decrease of shelfal carbonate production and the increase of detrital input in the Early Langhian correspond with a second important episode of seepcarbonate precipitation in the inner foredeep (Castagno d'Andrea); 3) {{the demise of the}} carbonate shelf and the coeval expulsion of methane-rich fluids in the inner foredeep (Vicchio and M. Citerna seepcarbonates) at the Langhian/Serravallian boundary approximate the Mi 3 b cooling event. The lower temperatures, associated with increased siliciclastic weathering, led to the crisis of shallow-water carbonate production whereas the pressure drop due to the eustatic fall may have triggered the gas-charged fluid expulsion; 4) the tectonic-related uplift of frontal sectors of the wedge-top basin led to the wide erosion of the Burdigalian-Langhian carbonates and caused the precipitation of authigenic seepcarbonates (Deruta seep) both in the slope and the adjacent foredeep...|$|R

A combination of the recorded stratal organization {{with the results of}} spectral analyses performed on CaCO 3 data and faunal signals shows a dominance of the classic Milankovitch periodicities as modulating forcing of the studied succession. The application of band-pass filters allowed us to select the different Milankovitch frequencies (precession, obliquity and short- and long-eccentricity) from the original faunal and geochemical signals and to compare them with the same components of the astronomical curve. The reliability of the short-term astronomical tuning has been tested by using the larger-order cyclicity (100 - 400 kyr) as control. The good match of the different records with the selected insolation curve is consistent with the results of the cross-spectral analysis showing high coherency values in all the considered frequency bands. The calibration provided astronomical ages for the sedimentary cycles and consequently for all the bioevents recorded in the section. In particular, an age of 13. 59 Ma has been obtained for the last occurrence (LO) of Sphenolitus heteromorphus, at present considered the best bioevent useful for recognizing the Langhian/Serravallian boundary.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a subvolcanic {{intrusion}} on its host rocks in the Priego de Córdoba area (SE Spain) was studied by optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. The intrusion of a laccolith of stratiform dolerite in partially consolidated <b>marly</b> <b>sediments</b> at quite shallow depths below the ocean floor {{took place during the}} intracontinental rifting phase of the Subbetic zone of the Betic Cordilleras. In the first stage, contact metamorphism caused the crystallization of calc-silicate consisting of grossular andradite garnet, diopside, vesuvianite and titanite for which the upper temperature limit was 500 °C. Phyllosilicates are found in a network of veins cross-cutting the carbonate and calc-silicate matrix, indicating their formation during a process of hydrothermal alteration superimposed on the contact aureole. In the area closest to the subvolcanic rocks, saponite is the main phyllosilicate although some dispersed chlorite is found. In the zone furthest from the contact, corrensite together with saponite and beidellitic smectites were observed. The presence of low-temperature phases (saponite) in the area closest to the laccolith reveals the evolution of the hydrothermal system toward cooler conditions. In the early stage, the circulation of a hot hydrothermal fluid caused the crystallization of chlorite in the area surrounding the subvolcanic body and corrensite in the more distal area, which might have begun even during the contact metamorphism stage. A cooling phase followed, resulting in the crystallization of saponite in the host rocks, and the crystallization of dioctahedral and trioctahedral smectites inside the subvolcanic body.

50|$|The Lias {{started with}} a {{transgression}} that {{is more important than}} the advances of the Muschelkalk and Keuper seas. Its total thickness varies between 150 and 400 m. The sea level kept rising during the Hettangian and fossiliferous limestones were deposited; this trend reversed later on into a regression leaving evaporites (rock salt and anhydrite with some calcareous interlayers). At the edge of the basin and in the eastern Pyrenees, argillaceous limestones and banded dolomites with layers of anhydrite settled out; the dolomites transformed upon dissolution of the anhydrite into monogenic breccias. The regression continued during the Lower Sinemurian, sedimenting intra- and supra-tidal banded limestones and dolomites. In the Upper Sinemurian (Lotharingian), more open-marine conditions established themselves due to a renewed sea-level rise; in deeper parts of the basin, fossiliferous limestones developed, whereas, on high ground, oolithic limestones accumulated. The Middle Lias (Pliensbachian) started off transgressive as well with fine-grained detrital, limey to <b>marly</b> <b>sediments</b> (ferruginous oolites, fossiliferous limestones and marls) that change over to marls. In the eastern Pyrenees, pyrite-bearing claystones formed due to a badly oxygenated environment; they contain a very diverse fauna of ammonites belonging to the French southeastern domain, whereas the ammonite population on the Atlantic side is rather monotonous. During the Upper Lias (Toarcian), the sea reached a high stand, continuing with the fine-grained detrital sedimentation and depositing black pelagic marls (marnes noires and schistes esquilleux). Towards the end of the Lias, regressive tendencies again became noticeable.|$|R

(2003). We submit data demonstrating that these conclusions are incorrect. Ricetto is clearly pyrometamorphic, as described by Capitanio et al. (2001, 2004). Colle Fabbri is clearly an igneous outcrop as described in Stoppa (1988). It is quite different in scale, field relationships, and chemistry, and thus Ricetto is irrelevant to its petrogenesis. The sediment mixing model of Melluso et al. (2003) does not relate to the Colle Fabbri field data. Furthermore, the Ricetto Miocene flysch country-rock and the Colle Fabbri enclosing Pliocene clays were not analyzed by Melluso et al. (2003).

(2003, Tables 3 4) and a 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratio of 0. 51213 for Apennine shales (op. cit. p. 1297) fails to account for the Colle Fabbri samples, which remain well clear of the hypothetical mixing line.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{boundary}} {{interval between}} the Cenomanian and Turonian {{stages of the}} Upper Cretaceous shows a positive xcursion in the carbon isotopic composition of organic matter and carbonate in many epicontinental nd oceanic sections of the Atlantic-Tethyan realm. Some of the studied epicontinental sections contain an excursion in the manganese content of carbonates coincident with the shift in carbon isotopic values. In a key reference section at Pueblo, Colorado, the stratigraphic position and magnitude of the manganese excursion are described {{with respect to the}} carbon isotopic excursion. Coincident excursions in manganese contents and carbon isotopic values are verified for a section in Normandy, France. The depositional setting for these two sections is persistently to intermittently well oxygenated with the accumulation ofinterbcdded chalky and <b>marly</b> <b>sediments.</b> No shift in manganese values was detected through the isotopic excursion in a section from northern Nebraska, where fossils are preserved only as bedding-plane impressions due to extensive arly diagenetic dissolution of carbonate. The carbon-isotopic and manganese excursions begin at the same stratlgraphic position, but manganese contents return to back-ground values within {{the lower half of the}} carbon-isotopic excursion. The relative timing and duration of these signals suggest the existence of a large manganese r servoir that was rapidly mobilized. Transfer of manganese from deep-sea oxides (Mn *+) to epieontinental carbonates (Mn 2 +) is inferred to have occurred uring expansion of oceanic oxygen-minimum zones with associated changes in redox gradients and boundaries.

Results of our study indicate that the stratigraphic horizon bearing seep-carbonates is constrained by two planktonic foraminiferal events, the Acme End (AE) of Turborotalita cf. T. quinqueloba (13. 75 Ma) and the Acme 1 Beginning (A 1 B) of Paragloborotalia siakensis (13. 32 Ma), encompassing about 400, 000 years. The AE of T. cf. T. quinqueloba approximates the mid-Miocene global cooling event (Mi 3 b), {{as defined by the}} δ 18 O maxima (13. 78 Ma). The glacio-eustatic sea level drop associated with this cooling event is estimated to be approximately 60 m. Assuming that the highest rates of glacio-eustatic sea level fall coincide with δ 18 O maxima, the timing of the seepage onset (at about 13. 75 Ma) is concomitant with the phase of sea level-lowering. The ascent and emission of methane-rich fluids may have been triggered by pressure drop due to the eustatic fall associated with the Mi 3 b event. The moderate intensity of fluid expulsion is suggested by the lack of brecciation, by the scarcity of detrital particles in the carbonates and by the pervasive occurrence of carbonate in the enclosing marls. This type of seepage differs from focused fault-confined fluid flows, typical of other tectonically controlled Apenninic seep-carbonates. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Therefore there is potential for research into known but previously undescribed Croatian mid-Miocene marine diatomites from the perspective of their potential as proper DE that could be mixed with plant extracts as a new formulation for grain storage protection. The marine diatomites belong to the Paratethyan near shore environment, deposited in the upwelling zone during a mid-Miocene temperate climate. Palaeontological, mineral and geochemical analyses were done on ten promising <b>marly</b> <b>sediments</b> from 26 outcrops and one borehole from the North Croatian Basin. The most important ingredient of diatomaceous sediments is silica (biogenic opal-Aand SiO 2 bound in other silicate minerals including quartz, clay minerals, micas, etc.). The amorphous silica content of the tested Croatian diatomites is relatively low (< 50 %) in comparison with the Celatom® MN 51 standard (medium to high efficient DE) (73. 6 %), nevertheless they show insome part even slightly better efficacy against insects. It seems that the enhanced content of smectite in diatomaceous sediments also influences increased absorption of DE. Based on palaeontological results, the most efficient diatomites from the Podsusedsko Dolje and Markuševec (Medvednica Mt.) consist of the mid-sized planktonic Coscinodiscus group of species whereThalassionema nitzschioides dominate and is positively correlated with their absorption. The usage of Boströms’ standard formula for getting opal-A from geochemical data was abandoned because of negative results and the modified Murdmaas’ formula for hemipelagic sediments was applied.

Within-suite chemical and isotopic variations are interpreted in terms of open system differentiation processes held responsible for enrichment {{in a number of}} trace elements and for radiogenic Sr observed in both Procida and Ventotene volcanic sequences. Conversely, trace element contents and Sr-Nd-isotopic compositions of the least-evolved among the investigated samples are thought to reflect source region characteristics with only negligible crustal contamination of the primary magmas. The data support an origin from distinct source regions for the primary magmas. In the case of Ventotene, the source would have been asthenospheric and/or lithospheric mantle with features similar to transitional mid-ocean ridge basalts (T-MORB), modified by enriching agents made up mainly of subducted slab-released components coming from <b>marly</b> <b>sediments</b> (about 7 %) similar to cherts from Tuscan Apennines plus a limestone contribution. In the case of Procida, the source would have been asthenospheric and/or lithospheric mantle with a slightly more enriched T-MORB-like feature with respect to Ventotene, modified by slab-derived enriching agents, likely represented by a small amount of sediments (about 2. 5 %) of oceanic nature (mostly terrigenous/pelagic).

Thus, a sharp heterogeneity exists in the mantle beneath the Campanian Region.

40|$|Reaction path modelling, {{coupled with}} preparatory inverse modelling, {{was applied to}} test this model’s ability to {{reproduce}} the wide compositional range of ground waters circulating in a restricted area in Piedmont, Italy. This approach {{is based on the}} assumption that the chemistry of groundwater evolves through a series of partial equilibria with secondary minerals until it reaches its final composition. PHREEQC (Purkhurst and Appelo, 1999) and EQ 3 / 6 (Wolery and Daveler, 1992) software packages were used to effect simulations. Reaction-path modelling was performed in time mode, taking into account the different rates of dissolution of each dissolving mineral. Data from literature regarding the kinetic parameters of dissolving minerals and the mineralogical composition of the host-rock were used. The results of the reaction-path modelling show that the composition of the analysed water samples was adequately reproduced, notwithstanding the hydrogeological complexity of the studied area. Modelling results provided very different water compositions as an effect of the chemical maturity, the physico-chemical parameters (fCO 2, fO 2, and temperature) and the variable amounts of gypsum among dissolving rock-forming minerals, which occur in Miocene levels of the sedimentary sequence. Further variability is related to the occasional contribution of brackish waters trapped in euxinic <b>marly</b> <b>sediments,</b> locally sealed by overlying clays, that have assumed an artesian character. The composition of some of the water samples can only be predicted by simulation runs performed at a temperature higher than that of the outlet (40 °C).

The same area has recently been affected by moderate seismicity, which has been accompanied by changes in either the temperature or chemistry, or both, of the ground waters.

40|$|In the Pliocene, the paleogeography {{of central}} Crete {{consisted}} {{of a number of}} basins which were filled by predominantly <b>marly</b> <b>sediments.</b> In the sedimentary sequence numerous laminated sapropelic intercalations can be observed. At a higher stratigraphic level diatomaceous laminites appear. From field data and sediment analyses we have inferred a shallowing for this sequence. Correlation of the individual strata shows that sapropelic laminites and diatomites were formed simultaneously. Turbidity-controlled differences in primary production are considered to be responsible for the simultaneous formation of both lithology types. Thickness of the sapropels is determined primarily by the amount of clastic input; in diatomites thickness depends on different rates of production of siliceous micro-organisms. The benthonic foraminifera from the sediment successions were subjected to a quantitative study. On the basis of R-mode statistical analyses we can divide the benthonic fauna into a group with preference for the homogeneous sediments, a laminite-bound group and a group with an intermediate position. The statistical analyses suggest the existence of a stagnation gradient for the depositional environments of the successive laminites. At the extreme end of this gradient the autochthonous fauna is replaced by allochthonous benthonic elements. It can be demonstrated that the degree of stagnation during each period of laminite formation differed from basin to basin and was at its maximum in relatively shallow environments. A stagnation gradient seems to be of little value for the homogeneous sediments. Here, minor faunal changes can be attributed to shallowing and the development of better nutrient conditions. From distributional, sedimen,tary and faunistic evidence it is concluded that the Pliocene periods of stagnation are best expressed in a marginal setting. Periodically increased run-off seems to provide the most likely explanation for the origin of the Pliocene laminated sediments. Low saline land-derived waters caused the termination of the vertical circulation. In addition, such waters brought nutrients into the marine realm, giving rise to enhanced production in surface waters...|$|R

This time interval is useful to investigate the oceanographic evolution of the (paleo) Mediterranean after the interruption of communications between the Mediterranean and Indo-Pacific areas. This important paleogeographic event, estimated at about 16 Ma by Johnson (1985) and at about 14. 5 Ma by Woodruff and Savin (1991), represented the first step of a progressive oceanographic evolution of the Tethys region water masses towards present Mediterranean conditions. A comparison of long-term planktonic and benthic d 18 O trends suggests that the intermediate outflowing Mediterranean water (proto-MIW), originated in the surface eastern zone of upper Langhian lower Serravallian (paleo) Mediterranean, had hydrographic and hydrodynamic features similar to those of the present Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW). Focusing our attention on benthic species which can be considered the best recorders of variation of proto-MIW production, we elaborated benthic data by Q-mode varimax principal factor analysis. Spectral analysis was carried out only on two factors which have a clear paleoecological significance: Factor 1 (loaded by Cibicidoides ungerianus and Siphonina reticulata) indicative of oxic bottom waters and Factor 2 (loaded by Bulimina elongata group) indicative of oxygen stressed conditions. Results of these analyses show that Factor 1 and Factor 2 curves are respectively in and out of phase with maxima of the eccentricity (100 and 400 kyr). Factor 1 is interpreted as a tracer of high production of proto-MIW, during periods of high eccentricity and, probably, precession minima, characterized by coldest winter seasons. These results point out a direct link between selected benthic species, long term astronomical forcing, and deep water response and provide an useful tool for astronomical calibration of geological time and paleoceanographic reconstructions...|$|R
40|$|The upper Sinemurian to Pliensbachian {{series of}} the Lusitanian Basin (Portugal) {{correspond}} to <b>marly</b> limestone <b>sediments</b> rich in benthic and nektonic macrofauna. This sedimentary record includes several intervals of organicrich facies, which are particularly well developed in the western sectors of the basin. They correspond to grey and dark marls locally showing strong lamination (black shale type) and are {{recognized as one of}} the most important potential oil source rocks. This study shows the vertical and lateral distribution of these organic-rich intervals, supported by over 550 total organic carbon (TOC) determinations. The results presented reveal two important intervals, with several black shale occurrences, in the Oxynotum(?) –Raricostatum (Polvoeira Member of Água de Madeiros Formation) and at the top of the Ibex-upper part of Margaritatus zones (top of the Vale das Fontes Formation), showing in the distal (western) sectors up to 22 % and 15 % TOC, respectively. TOC values decrease progressively towards the proximal sectors, the youngest organic-rich interval being the most expressive at the basin scale. This lateral TOC distribution, the facies stacking patterns and the decrease observed in benthic macrofauna confirm that these intervals are related to 2 nd-order transgressive phases. 2 nd-order regressive phases, developed during the uppermost Raricostatum and Spinatum zones respectively, show lower TOC values. TOC distribution combined with other stratigraphic and sedimentological parameters enabled seven facies maps to be created for the time interval studied. At the regional scale, this study shows for the first time the good similarity between the upper Sinemurian-Pliensbachian sedimentary successions of the Lusitanian and Basque- Cantabrian basins...|$|R
40|$|The {{examination}} of about eighty exposures of lucinid deposits of the Apennine chain based on new field analyses and previous data, and the compositional study {{of one hundred}} samples representative of the different geological settings in which lucinid assemblages are found, enable us to distinguish four types of deposits. Type 1 and type 2 are primary (autochthonous) deposits whereas type 3 and type 4 are secondary (allochthonous) deposits. Type 1 deposits consist of marly-calcareous and calcarenitic lenses or columnar bodies, jammed with articulated lucinid-like shells, usually belonging to oligotypic communities and grading into the surrounding pelitic sediments. Most of the samples are made of homogeneous micrites, biomiocrites and fossiliferous micrites, containing variable amounts of biogenic particles, chiefly planktonic foraminifera. Type 2 deposits {{are made up of}} lucinid shells, either isolated or associated with a more diverse fauna, in mudstones, marls, arenitic and calcareous marls. Type 3 deposits are constituted of carbonate olistoliths enclosed as blocks within chaotic horizons in turbiditic and hemipelagic formations of the Miocene foredeep. Type 4 deposits are represented by coquina debris, isolated articulated or disarticulated shells in resedimented arenites, calcarenites, carbonate breccias with biogenic debris. Samples of secondary deposits show a noticeable variety of lithologies and textures and are very heterogeneous even at the microscopic scale. The most common lithotypes include fine to medium grained arenites characterized by a loosely detrital fabric and by a pervasive micrite cement. Fossiliferous micrites and biomicrites with brecciated textures are common. The detrital framework show striking similarities to the composition of the host turbidites. Carbonate intraclasts and clasts deriving from lithotypes of the ligurian domain are present. Most of the type 1 and 3 deposits are strongly 13 C depleted and are interpreted as chemosynthetic communities (chemoherms), with authigenic carbonate deposition related to methane-rich fluid venting. Type 1 deposits occur only in thick pelitic sediments belonging to the satellite (Termina Formation of the epiligurian sequence) and to the foredeep basins (Vicchio and Letto Marls). Type 2 deposits are instead related to normal marine conditions, whereas the type 4 could have their source from all the other types of deposits. Secondary lucinid deposits occur {{in a wide range of}} different tectonic setting, from backland to foreland, with a concentration in the middle Miocene foredeep. The secondary lucinid deposits of the foredeep turbidites evidenced several different grades of allochthony and multiple provenances. Lucinid deposits in the Marnoso-arenacea turbidites show evidence of a moderate reworking, probably from the enclosed pelitic horizons or from adjacent slope pelites. The source of the oldest chemoherms seems to be represented by the Vicchio Marls, whereas isolated shells and coquina debris in resedimented beds of the minor basins and Cervarola foredeep probably originate from satellite basins or from methane-derived biological communities located in fine-grained horizons no longer preserved. The peculiar brecciated structures observed in many lucinid chemoherms are probably the result of a number of superimposed processes, involving fluidization of sediments and reworking for gravity mass transport. Mud diapirism and/or injection, related to overpressuring of sediments due to methanogenic fluid venting, could account for the formation of the brecciated structures resembling those related to gravity flow processes. Fluidization of sediments may also represent an important mechanism able to increase the instability of pelitic <b>marly</b> <b>sediments,</b> thus favouring gravity slumping processes...|$|R
40|$|Some Internal Units of {{the western}} Alpine peri-Mediterranean orogenic system (Betic Cordillera, Calabria-Peloritani Arc) point out to a complex Alpine tectono-metamorphic {{evolution}} followed by an exhumation phase. Before {{the onset of the}} Alpine compressive tectonics, the rocks of these units belonged to the margins of a microcontinent, the Mesomediterranean Microplate, originated, together with the main plates, following the break-up of Pangaea. To these units, characterized by similar tectono-sedimentary evolution, belongs the Alì-Montagnareale Unit of the Peloritani Mountains (NE Sicily), where the Internal Units of the Sicilian sector of the Maghrebian Chain crop out. The Alì-Montagnareale Unit appears within two small tectonic semi-windows, under the phyllites of the Mandanici-Piraino Unit, and it proves to be formed by three groups of anchimetamorphic formations. The Lower Group is made up of two Upper Permian?-Upper Triassic siliciclastic formations, which grade into each other and which were deposited in alluvial environments. This group is followed by the Intermediate Group, consisting of Middle?-Upper? Triassic formations, indicating deposition in an evaporitic coastal plain evolving to a marine carbonate platform. The Upper Group consists of a Pliensbachian formation, made up of pelagic calcilutites with added carbonate turbiditic beds, followed by a prevailingly marly formation with strata of silicified limestones and episodic calcareous re-sediments. In this latter formation, the finding of Jurassic fossils and Globuligerina oxfordiana, which occurs up to the Valanginian, indicate that the stratigraphic succession spans from the late Early Jurassic to the Late Jurassic and probably reaches the Early Cretaceous. The stratigraphic units are generally separated by tectonic contacts which act as preferential detachment surfaces during compressive and exhumation tectonic phases. The tectonic elision of more or less large intervals of the original stratigraphic succession is diffuse in both tectonic windows. The succession of the Alì-Montagnareale Unit testifies to extensional tectonics, which in Middle-Late Triassic determined the evolution of sedimentation from continental to evaporitic and neritic environments, and, since the Early Jurassic, to calcilutite and <b>marly</b> pelagic <b>sediments</b> with added calcareous re-sediments. This sedimentary evolution records the break-up of Pangaea and the successive opening of oceanic basins. A similar tectono-sedimentary history may be recognized in many other Internal Units of the Alpine peri-Mediterranean Chains...|$|R
40|$|The sandfraction of the {{sediment}} was analysed in five cores, taken from 65 m water depth {{in the central}} and {{eastern part of the}} Persian Gulf. The holocene marls are underlayn by aragonite muds, which are probably 10 - 11, 000 years old. 1. The cores could be subdivided into coarse grained and fine grained layers. Sorting is demonstrated by the following criteria: With increasing median values of the sandfraction - the fine grained fraction decreases within each core; - the median of each biogenic component, benthonic as well as planktonic, increases; - the median of the relict sediment, which in core 1179 was carried upward into the marl by bioturbation, increases; - the percentages of pelecypods, gastropods, decapods and serpulid worms in the sandfraction increase, the percentages of foraminifera and ostracods decrease; - the ratios of pelecypods to foraminifera and of decapods to ostracods increase; - the ratios of benthonic molluscs to planktonic molluscs (pteropods) and of benthonic foraminifera to planktonic foraminifera increase (except in core 1056 and 1179); - the ratio of planktonic molluscs (pteropods) to planktonic foraminifera increases; - the globigerinas without orbulinas increase, the orbulinas decrease in core 1056. Different settling velocities of these biogenic particles help in better understanding the results : the settling velocities, hence the equivalent hydrodynamic diameters, of orbulinas are smaller than those of other globigerinas, those of planktonic foraminifera are smaller than those of planktonic molluscs, those of planktonic molluscs are smaller than those of benthonic molluscs, those of pelecypods are smaller than those of gastropods. Bioturbation could not entirely distroy this "grain-size-stratification". Sorting has been stronger in the coarse layers than in the finer ones. As a cause variations in the supply of terrigenous material at constant strength of tidal currents is suggested. When much terrigenous material is supplied (large contents of fine grained fraction) {{the sediment}}ation rates are high: the respective sediment surface is soon covered and removed from the influence of tidal currents. When, however, the supply of terrigenous material is small, more sandy material is taken away in all locations within the influence of terrigenous supply. Thus the biogenic particles in the sediment do not only reflect the organic production, but also the influence of currents. 2. There is no parameter present in all cores that is independently variable from grain size and can be used for stratigraphic correlation. The two cores from the Strait of Hormus were correlated by their sequences of coarse and fine grained layers. 3. The sedimentation rates of terrigenous material, of total planktonic and benthonic organisms and of molluscs, foraminifera, echinoids and ophiuroids are shown in table 1 (total sediment 6. 3 - 75. 5 cm/ 1000 yr, biogenic carbonate 1. 9 - 3. 6 cm/ 1000 yr). The sedimentation rates of benthonic organisms are nearly the same in the cores of the Strait of Hormus, whereas near the Central Swell they are smaller. In the upper parts of the two cores of the Strait of Hormus sedimentation rates are higher than in the deeper parts, where higher median values point to stronger reworking. 4. The sequence of coarse and fine grained intervals in the two cores of the Hormus Strait, attributed to variations in climate, as well as the increase of terrigenous supply from the deeper to the upper parts of the cores, agrees with the descriptions in the literature of the post Pleistocene climate as becoming more humid. The rise of sea level is sedimentologically not measurable in the <b>marly</b> <b>sediments</b> - except perhaps for the higher content of echinoids in the lower part of core 1056. These may be attributed to the influence of a migrating wave-base. 5. The late Pleistocene aragonite mud is very fine grained (> 50 %< 2 p) and poor in fossils (0. 5 - 1. 8 %) biogenic particles of total sediment. The sand fraction consists almost entirely of white clumps, c. 0. 1 mm in diameter (1177), composed of aragonite needles and of detrital minerals with the same size (1201). The argonite mud was probably not formed in situ, because the water depth at time of formation was at most 35 m at least 12 m. The sorting of the sediment (predominance of the fine grained sand), the absence of larger biogenic components and of pellets, c. 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm in diameter, which are typical for Recent and Pleistocene locations of aragonite formation, as well as the sedimentological conditions near the sampling points, indicate rather a transport of aragonite mud from an area of formation in very shallow waters. Sorting as well as lenticular fabric in core 1201 point to sedimentation within the influence of currents. During alternating sedimentation - and reworking processes the aragonitic matrix was separated from the silt - and sand-sized minerals. The lenses grade into touches because of bioturbation. 6. In core 1056 D 2 from Hormus Bay the percentages of organic carbon, total nitrogen and total carbonate were determined. With increasing amounts of smaller grain sizes the content of organic matter increases, whereas the amount of carbonate decreases. The amounts of organic carbon and of nitrogen decrease with increasing depth, probably due to early-diagenetic decomposition processes. Most of the total nitrogen is of organic origin, only about 10 % may well be inorganically fixed as ammonium-nitrogen. In {{the upper part of the}} core the C/N-ratio increases with increasing depth. This may be connected with a stronger decomposition of nitrogen-containing organic compounds. The general decrease of the C/N-ratios in the lower part of the core may be explained by the relative increase of inorganically fixed ammonium-nitrogen with decreasing content of organic matter...|$|R
40|$|The Scaglia Toscana {{represents}} a stratigraphic unit {{belonging to the}} Tuscan Domain of the Northern Apennines. Such a stratigraphic unit results lithologically heterogeneous, and is representative of {{a very long time}} span (from the Early Cretaceous to the Oligocene) during which very important geological events took place, such as the convergence and collisional events giving rise to the edification of the Northern Apennines orogene. We have studied several key outcrops of the Scaglia Toscana exposed in the Rapolano Terme area (Southern Tuscany, Northern Apennines) in order to contribute to the reconstruction of the depositional setting and palaeogeographical features of a sector of the Tuscan Domain from the Cretaceous to the Early Miocene, and to hypothesise a possible geodynamic evolution. The Scaglia Toscana exposed in the Rapolano Terme area has been deeply investigated through lithostragraphic and biostratigraphic analyses mainly carried out in three key areas indicated in the fig. 1 : 1) the Podere Cetinaia-Podere Monte Petroso section; 2) the Podere Le Rossole section; and 3) the Modanella-Podere Campo d’Aia section. From the top (represented by the overlying Macigno Fm) to the bottom (Maiolica Fm) we have recognized three litostratigraphic units: 1) Claystones and calcarenites (Argilliti e calcareniti di Dudda), containing lenses of nummulite bearing calcarenites and calcirudites («Nummulitico», Calcareniti di Montegrossi). The thickness ranges from 50 to 100 m; Middle-Late Eocene. 2) Silty marls and claystones (Marne siltose ed argilliti marnose rosse di Podere Le Rossole) comparable for the age and stratigraphic position with the Marne del Sugame described in the Chianti Mts. The thickness does not exceed 10 m; Early-Middle Eocene. 3) Argilliti di Brolio consisting of three lithofacies: BRLa - manganesiferous radiolarites (thickness from 5 to 10 m); BRLb - siliceous siltstones (thickness of about 10 m); BRLc - red marly clays (thickness from 6 to 8 m); Albian-Turonian. The boundary separating the Argilliti di Brolio from the overlying Marne siltose ed argilliti marnose rosse di Podere Le Rossole is representative of a time gap about 7 Ma long (from 40 to 47 Ma). According to CANUTI & MARCUCCI (1967) we exclude the emersion during this time span, but we support for: i) the reduction of the sedimentation and/or; ii) submarine erosion induced by tectonic instability. Such possible hypotheses can be confirmed {{by the fact that the}} gap affects different stratigraphic horizons of the Argilliti di Brolio, and the sedimentation of the Marne siltose ed argilliti marnose rosse di Podere Le Rossole started diachronically. The sedimentary environment of the Marne siltose ed argilliti marnose rosse di Podere Le Rossole is pelagic-hemipelagic, characterised by Foraminifera bearing <b>marly</b> and pelitic <b>sediments.</b> The occurrence of thin bedded calcarenites indicates the formation of a turbidite system, mainly carbonate. Such a turbidite system typifies the overlying succession: the Argilliti e calcareniti di Dudda with interbedded Nummulites bearing calcarenites and calcirudites (Calcareniti di Montegrossi). The stratigraphic contact between the Argilliti e calcareniti di Dudda and the Marne siltose ed argilliti marnose rosse di Podere Le Rossole lithostratigraphic units is gradual and continuous, and is characterized by the frequency and thickness increase of the turbite beds, as well as by the progressive appearance of the reddish color, moreover characterizing the overlying Marne siltose ed argilliti marnose rosse di Podere Le Rossole. The sedimentological features of the Argilliti e calcareniti di Dudda suggest a radical change of the sedimentary environment. In fact, the hemipelagic sediments were substituted by the turbidite systems. The turbidites are characterized by graded beds containing Eocene planktonic Foraminifera indicating an intrabasinal reworking of penecontemporaneous sediments. Contrarily, the calcarenites of the upper part of the succession are characterized by Cretaceous planktonic Foraminifera being bioclasts indicating an extrabasinal origin. This is indicative for the development of a carbonate turbidite system fed by Cretaceous sediments. The uppermost part of the succession is newly typified by the occurrence of calcarenite beds with intrabasinal Eocene planktonic Foraminifera. Such a lithological assemblage and palaeontological containts became a recurrent feature for the overlying Nummulites bearing calcarenites and calcirudites («Nummulitico», Calcareniti di Montegrossi). Furthermore, these latter are characterized by Eocene benthonic Foraminifera suggesting the development of one or more lobes of a submarine fan channels fed by carbonate platforms. The Nummulite bearing calcarenites are characterized by a trend thinning-fining upward, and gradually pass to the Argilliti e calcareniti di Dudda, indicating the deactivation of the lobe fan system. Such a succession passes to the Macigno siliciclastic sandstone (Macigno Fm). In sum, we hyphotesise that the embryonal foredeep system of the Northern Apennines could be developed since the Middle-Late Eocene with the activation of a carbonate turbidite system (Argilliti e calcareniti di Dudda plus the Nummulites bearing calcarenites) successively evolved in a siliciclastic turbidite system represented by the Macigno Fm. The sedimentary gap recorded within the Scaglia Toscana succession could indicate the records of the beginning of the tectonic activity which affected the Tuscan Domain for a long time, related to the development of the Northern Apennines foredeep system...|$|R
40|$|Sixty {{exposures}} of lucinid deposits ("calcari a Lucina" of the literature) {{in different}} depositional and tectonic settings {{of the northern}} Apeninnes, from backland (satellite and minor basins) to foredeep (turbidites and closure deposits) and foreland (Sicily), were studied and, in many cases, reinterpreted in the field. Field and compositional data show that lucinid deposits include not only peculiar carbonate blocks, but a variety of lithologies and fossil assemblages: micritic limestones, marly limestones, mudstones, marls and arenitic marls, fine to coarse-grained arenites, fine to coarse-grained calcarenites, carbonate monomictic and polymictic breccias and microconglomerates. The fossil content is not only adscribable to the genus Lucina, but more generally to lucinids or other bivalves. Lithological and compositional characters are mainly controlled by the depositional and tectonic setting. Lucinid deposits from satellite basins and foredeep slope sediments show evidences of primary deposition while those included in foredeep turbidite deposits are clearly reworked. In some cases only isolated shells are reworked. Primary lucinid deposits occur as: - type 1) marly-calcareous and calcarenitic lenses or column-like bodies, crowded with articulated specimens usually representing the dominant fauna of an oligotypic community; these lenses are often clustered but not related to a precise stratigraphic level and they gradually pass to the host <b>sediments</b> (<b>marly</b> mudstones); - type 2) isolated specimens or associated with a dense high diversity fauna in mudstones, marls, arenitic and calcareous marls. Secondary lucinid deposits occur as: - type 3) carbonate olistoliths crowded with articulated or disarticulated specimens associated with an oligotypic fauna; they are usually enclosed within chaotic horizons made up of intraformational slumps, ligurian-subligurian olistostromes, ligurian-epiligurian olistoliths, resedimented arenitic beds and polymictic breccias, intercalated in turbiditic formations; - type 4) coquina debris, isolated articulated or disarticulated shells, (in few cases associated with abundant fauna from shelf areas) in resedimented arenites, calcarenites, carbonate breccias with biogenic debris (debrites). Most of the type- 1 and type- 3 deposits are strongly 13 C depleted, and are interpreted as chemosynthetic communities (pseudobioherms) with authigenic carbonate deposition related to methane-rich fluid vents. Petrographic data show that {{the composition of the}} siliciclastic fraction present in lucinid deposits is consistent with the composition of the host deposits. Lucinid deposits included in the foredeep turbidites of the Marnoso-arenacea and Cervarola Formations display a wide variety of textures and lithologies. Most of the samples are characterized by a sort of "chaotic" texture with an abundant terrigenous fraction associated with micritic intraclasts and planctonic foraminifera. The interstitial fraction is made of micrite, but microspatic to spatitic calcite cements and patchy poikilotopic calcite are also present. The composition of the terrigenous fraction shows a great similarity with the composition of the including turbidites, thus indicating only an intrabasinal reworking of lucinid deposits. In primary, non reworked lucinid deposits of the epiligurian (Termina Formation) and slope sediments (Vicchio and Letto Marls) the terrigenous fraction is absent or very scarse and fine-grained. Samples show more homogeneous textures and lithologies, mainly represented by micritic to biomicritic limestones; planctonic foraminifera are abundant. Detrital carbonate clasts of ligurian affinity are sometimes present in epiligurian lucinid outcrops. According to this study, primary pseudobioherms occur only in epiligurian and foredeep closure pelitic sediments, rich in organic matter. Lucinid deposits in the Marnoso-arenacea and Cervarola foredeep turbidites show evidence of a moderate reworking probably from adjacent slope pelites. Reworking processes are then related to the advancement of the deformational front, as indicated by slumps and olistostromes. Only lucinid deposits located {{at the top of the}} thrust belt front (satellite basins) or in mudstones marking the closure stage of the foredeep could have the possibility to be preserved as primary deposits, whereas most of the slope sediments, which represent the main source of secondary lucinid deposits, is reworked and resedimented in the turbiditic units. This is due to foredeep instability phenomena, probably heralding the tectonic events. On the other hand the cold seepage could have lowered the sediment shear strenght and opened the way to foredeep instability which in turn could let the gases out more easily. We hypothesize that the source of the oldest pseudobioherms is represented by the Vicchio Marls, whereas isolated shells and coquina debris in resedimented beds of the minor basins and of the problematic Cervarola-Falterona Formation of the Modena-Bologna Apennine, are probably originated from satellite basins or from faunal communities (methane related ?) located in pelitic horizons no more preserved. Confirming this hypothesis, two pelitic horizons bearing methanogenic lucinid blocks are still preserved in the inner Marnoso-arenacea. A comparison between lucinid concentration peaks (Serravallian-Tortonian and Tortonian-Messinian boundaries) and the neogenic tectonic events of the Apenninic chain do not show any particular relation. No direct connection between fracture planes and the irregular disposition of the non reworked lucinid deposits seems to be evident. Thus further studies are necessary in order to better understand the relations between the advancement of the thrust belt front and fluid escape. Isotopic, sedimentological, stratigraphycal and structural data seem to support that biogenic methane is likely to have been the main source for primary pseudobioherms and related carbonate deposits. The gas could have a shallow origin in local pockets from biodegradation of trapped organic matter. Lucinid pseudiobioherms grew in different open marine environment, from outer shelf to deep basins and do not characterize a precise paleogeographic or paleotectonic setting. Petrographic data also suggest to correlate the Castel Guerrino unit to the Marnoso-arenacea Formation and to interpret the middle Miocene Cervarola Formation of the Modena-Bologna Apennine as a minor foredeep basin (internal part of the Marnoso-arenacea Formation ?) ...|$|R
