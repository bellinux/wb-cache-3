40|$|The {{prospects}} of using nuclear energy in Saudi Arabia for desalination and {{electric power generation}} represent a challenging engineering problem. Three specific issues have been considered for a dual-purpose plant, namely: (1) Impact of the availability and reliability of the desalination plants, (2) Integration of the desalination and power production stages, and, (3) Safety considerations of dual systems;The operational history data of the Jeddah desalination plants are studied, to determine the reliability of a multi-stage flash (MSF) desalination plant and of a reverse osmosis plant (RO);MSF plant performance, operation conditions, and the most common causes of deviation from plant performance standards are presented. Actual operation data from an MSF plant are analyzed. Potential problem areas and critical components are identified, and failure rates are estimated;Fault tree techniques are used for major systems in both MSF and RO plants, and a quantitative evaluation is performed using PREP-KITT computer codes to assess the probability of failure of the MSF and RO plants. The results of such studies showed that the major contributors of unavailability are pump failures, screen failures, pipe leakages, <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valve</b> failures, and tube leakages. Recommendations for improving the reliability of MSF systems are given;The reliability and operational experience of the RO plant are analyzed, {{and the results of}} the RO plant availability analysis are given for four cases of operation in which failure contributors are membrane fractures, pump failures, diesel engine failures, and pipe leakages;The analysis of the operation history of both desalination plants revealed some very important factors which have been considered. The implications of dual-purpose nuclear desalination plants are discussed for technical, safety, and operational aspects of these plants. Also, the schemes of integration of nuclear steam supply systems with the MSF plant are presented. A comparison of RO and MSF processes {{from the point of view}} of reliability, safety, and compatibility with nuclear power as an energy source is presented. Finally, the overall availability of nuclear desalination plants is estimated based on actual data from operating experience...|$|E

For pipes which inject {{water into the}} containment, two safety-related check valves are generally used in lieu of <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves.</b> These valves must be tested regularly as well to ensure they do indeed seal and prevent leakage even against high reactor pressures.|$|R

By physically blocking incorrect operations, valve interlocks enforce such sequences, rather than interfering with them. Valve interlocks are permanently mounted to manual and <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> and the closure door. The interlocks block operation of a valve or door, unless the appropriate keys are inserted.|$|R

40|$|Safety related <b>valves</b> such as <b>Motor</b> <b>Operated</b> <b>Valves</b> (MOV), Air <b>Operated</b> <b>Valves</b> (AOV) or Check Valves (CV) play an {{important}} role in nuclear power plant. Functioning of these valves mainly aim at emergency reactivity control, post-accident residue heat removal, post-accident radioactivity removal and containment isolation when a design basis accident occurred. In order to maintain these valves under operable conditions, an Inservice Testing Program (IST) is defined for routine testing tasks based on the ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code section XI code requirements. Risk based Inservice Testing Programs have been studied and developed extensively in the nuclear energy industry since the 1990 s. Risk Based evaluations of IST can bring positive advantages to the licensee such as identifying the vulnerability of the system, reducing unnecessary testing burden, concentrating testing resources on the critical pass oriented valves and saving plant's personnel dose exposure. This risk evaluation is incorporated with quantitative and qualitative analyses to the <b>Motor</b> <b>Operated</b> <b>Valves</b> under current Inservice Testing Program for PWR nuclear power plant in Taiwan. With the outcome of the risk classifications for the safety related MOVs through numerical or deterministic analyses, a risk based testing frequency relief is suggested to demonstrate the benefits received from the risk based Inservice Testing Program. The goal made of this study, it could be as a reference and cornerstone for the licensee to perform overall scope Risk-Informed Inservice Testing Program (RI-IST) evaluation by referring relevant methodologies established in this study.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The current {{method of}} {{determining}} component failure rates for probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) {{in the nuclear}} industry {{is to take the}} total number of failures divided by the time over which the failures occurred. The method proposed in this study is the reliability growth method and involves taking into account the fact that the amount of failures per additional year of operation generally decreases yearly because the operational staff becomes familiar with the equipment. The reliability growth method will result in lower component failure rates which when used in PRA studies could result in a lower core melt frequency value. The component failure rate would be expected to be higher in the early stages and should gradually decrease as time goes on. This study will compare the final core melt frequency of the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant using both methods. The Nuclear Power Reactor Data System (NPRDS) data base from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) was used in this study. The components which were examined for the reliability growth method are <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves,</b> service water pump/motors and emergency diesel generator air chargers. These data were screened to ensure that only true failures were reported. A comparison was made of the overall core melt frequency between the conventional failure rate method and reliability growth method for the <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves.</b> The overall core melt frequency was decreased by 1. 8...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{nuclear power}} plants, both newly {{designed}} generation 3 and existing generation 2 reactors, {{make use of}} passive safety systems for significant and measurable improvements in safety and reliability. Medium Pressure Safety Injection System (MP-SIS) in Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant is a typical and very important nuclear safety passive system. This paper discusses the reliability of MP-SIS {{on the basis of}} Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) with unavailability and Minimal Cut Set (MCS) calculated as two important indicators. The result illustrates that the passive MP-Safety Injection Tank barely contributes to the system’s unavailability and human interactions with Manual <b>Valves</b> and <b>Motor</b> <b>Operated</b> <b>Valves</b> have great negative impact on the reliability...|$|R

Some ball valves are {{equipped}} with an actuator that may be pneumatically, hydraulically or <b>motor</b> <b>operated.</b> These <b>valves</b> can be used either for on/off or flow control. A pneumatic flow control valve is also equipped with a positioner which transforms the control signal into actuator position and valve opening accordingly.|$|R
40|$|<b>Motor</b> <b>Operated</b> <b>Valves</b> (MOVs) are {{electro-mechanical}} components used to isolate, divert, or introduce fluid flow. The use of {{microprocessor relays}} for actuator motor electrical protection within {{nuclear power plants}} {{is the focus of}} this thesis and is implemented by providing a new and enhanced protection scheme that provides the adequate conservatism necessary to ensure valve operation while still maintaining electrical safety and continued operational availability. The comprehensive protection scheme is designed around an advanced microprocessor relay that has the ability to simulate the thermal overload conditions of a <b>motor</b> <b>operating</b> into a destructive thermal region. Through laboratory testing, the validity of this new protection scheme is tested using a simulation of common MOV degradations. Finally, this thesis addresses the design from a licensing basis perspective that follows Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) guidance on the use of MOV thermal overload protective devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{unavailability}} of standby {{safety system}} components due to failures in {{nuclear power plants}} is considered to involve a time independent and a time dependent part. The former relates to the component`s unavailability from demand stresses due to usage, and the latter represents the component`s unavailability due to standby time stresses related to the environment. In this paper, data from the nuclear plant reliability data system (NPRDS) were used to partition the component`s unavailability into the contributions from standby time stress (i. e., due to environmental factors) and demand stress (i. e., due to usage). Analyses are presented of <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> (MOVs), <b>motor</b> driven pumps (MDPs), and turbine driven pumps (FDPs). MOVs fail predominantly (approx. 78 %) from environmental factors (standby time stress failures). MDPs fail slightly more frequently from demand stresses (approx. 63 %) than standby time stresses, while TDPs fail predominantly from standby time stresses (approx. 78 %). Such partitions of component unavailability have many uses in risk informed and performance based regulation relating to modifications to Technical Specification, in-service testing, precise determination of dominant accident sequences, and implementation of maintenance rules...|$|R
40|$|Common-cause failure (CCF) {{events can}} {{significantly}} impact {{the availability of}} safety systems of nuclear power plants. For this reason, the International Common Cause Data Exchange (ICDE) project was initiated by several countries in 1994. Since 1997 it has been operated within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) /Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) framework and has successfully been operated over six consecutive terms (the current term being 2015 – 2017). The ICDE project allows multiple countries to collaborate and exchange CCF data to {{enhance the quality of}} risk analyses, which include CCF modeling. As CCF events are typically rare, most countries do not experience enough CCF events to perform meaningful analyses. Data combined from several countries, however, have yielded sufficient data for more rigorous analyses. The ICDE project has meanwhile published 11 reports on the collection and analysis of CCF events of specific component types (centrifugal pumps, emergency diesel generators, <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves,</b> safety and relief valves, check valves, circuit breakers, level measurement, control rod drive assemblies, and heat exchangers) and two topical reports. This paper presents recent activities and lessons learnt from the data collection and the results of topical analysis on emergency diesel generator CCF impacting entire exposed population...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{models in the}} {{literature}} that have been proposed in the last decades aimed at assessing the reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) of safety equipment, many of them {{with a focus on}} their use to assess the risk level of a technological system or to search for appropriate design and/or surveillance and maintenance policies in order to assure that an optimum level of RAM of safety systems is kept during all the plant operational life. This paper proposes a new approach for RAM modelling that accounts for equipment ageing and maintenance and testing effectiveness of equipment consisting of multiple items in an integrated manner. This model is then used to perform the simultaneous optimization of testing and maintenance for ageing equipment consisting of multiple items. An example of application is provided, which considers a simplified High Pressure Injection System (HPIS) of a typical Power Water Reactor (PWR). Basically, this system consists of motor driven pumps (MDP) and <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> (MOV), where both types of components consists of two items each. These components present different failure and cause modes and behaviours, and they also undertake complex test and maintenance activities depending on the item involved. The results of the example of application demonstrate that the optimization algorithm provide the best solutions when the optimization problem is formulated and solved considering full flexibility in the implementation of testing and maintenance activities taking part of such an integrated RAM model.

40|$|Some <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> {{now have}} higher torque switch {{settings}} due to regulatory requirements to ensure valve operability with appropriate margins at design basis conditions. Verifying operability with these settings imposes higher stem loads during periodic inservice testing. These higher test loads increase stresses {{in the various}} valve internal parts which may in turn increase the fatigue usage factors. This increased fatigue is judged to be a concern primarily in the valve disks, seats, yokes, stems, and stem nuts. Although the motor operators may also have significantly increased loading, they are being evaluated by the manufacturers and are {{beyond the scope of}} this study. Two gate valves representative of both relatively weak and strong valves commonly used in commercial nuclear applications were selected for fatigue analyses. Detailed dimensional and test data were available for both valves from previous studies at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. Finite element models were developed to estimate maximum stresses in the internal parts of the valves and to identity the critical areas within the valves where fatigue may be a concern. Loads were estimated using industry standard equations for calculating torque switch settings prior and subsequent to the testing requirements of USNRC Generic Letter 89 [...] 10. Test data were used to determine both; (1) the overshoot load between torque switch trip and final seating of the disk during valve closing and (2) the stem thrust required to open the valves. The ranges of peak stresses thus determined were then used to estimate the increase in the fatigue usage factors due to the higher stem thrust loads. The usages that would be accumulated by 100 base cycles plus one or eight test cycles per year over 40 and 60 years of operation were calculated...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} of the Space Shuttle bipropellant reaction control system engine technology contract and the scheduled contract effort are presented herein. The requirements included an engine concept scalable from 400 to 1100 lbf, with a 100 mission life employing N 2 O 4 /MMH propellants. Emphasis is placed on reusability and minimum post-flight servicing. The engine components are reviewed and their selection is supported by tradeoff analyses, thrust chamber firing test data, materials test data, and metallurgical evaluations. The materials test data indicate that the proposed silicide coated columbium chamber and uncoated columbium injector have the potential of meeting the mission life requirements. The engine valve trade studies resulted {{in the selection of}} a torque <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> bipropellant <b>valve</b> configuration.

40|$|We {{report a}} newly {{developed}} water sampler WHATS (Water and Hydrothermal-fluid Atsuryoku Tight Sampler), for collecting seafloor venting gas-rich fluid (or gas itself) at in situ pressure (Atsuryoku means pressure in Japanese). It consist of four 150 cm 3 stainless steel sample cylinders, eight ball valves, a motor-driven arm, a rail, a peristaltic pump, and a flexible Teflon tube {{connected to a}} titanium inlet tube. The motor-driven arm on the rail can open {{one of the four}} cylinders. Then, by pumping out pure water that has filled the cylinder, we can introduce sample fluid into the cylinder. After completely replacing the pure water with sample fluid, the valves {{at both ends of the}} cylinder are tightly closed by moving the motor-driven arm again. At this stage, the next cylinder becomes to be ready for next sampling. We can take maximum 4 different gas-tight samples in series. Whole operation can be arranged inside the submersible cabin. Use of only one <b>motor</b> to <b>operate</b> <b>valves</b> makes the sampler small, light (28 kg in water), and easy to handle. With the sampler, we can collect almost uncontaminated sample because we pump fluid slowly (120 cm 3 /min.) into the cylinder using the peristaltic pump. To date, the sampler has been used for ca. 40 dives of shinkai 2000 and shinkai 6500 with the success rate of more the 90 %. We also evaluate the safety factors in handling highly pressured samples. We conclude that the sampler can be used to the depth of 3, 000 m...|$|R
40|$|The {{functions}} of the ECCS accumulators are to supply water to the reactor vessel during the blowdown phase of a {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA), to provide inventory to help accomplish the refill phase that follows thereafter, and to provide Reactor Coolant System (RCS) makeup for any LOCA that reduces RCS pressure to below the accumulator pressure. The blowdown phase of a large break LOCA is the initial period of the transient during which the RCS departs from equilibrium conditions, and heat from fission product decay, hot internals, and the vessel continues to be transferred to the reactor coolant. The blowdown phase of the transient ends when the RCS pressure falls to a value approaching that of the containment atmosphere. In the refill phase of a LOCA, which immediately follows the blowdown phase, reactor coolant inventory has vacated the core through steam flashing and ejection out through the break. The core is essentially in adiabatic heatup. The balance of accumulator inventory is then available to help fill voids in the lower plenum and reactor vessel downcomer so as to establish a recovery level {{at the bottom of the}} core and ongoing reflood of the core with the addition of safety injection (SI) water. The accumulators are pressure vessels partially filled with borated water and pressurized with nitrogen gas. The accumulators are passive components, since no operator or control actions are required in order for them to perform their function. Internal accumulator tank pressure is sufficient to discharge the accumulator contents to the RCS, if RCS pressure decreases below the accumulator pressure. Each accumulator is piped into an RCS cold leg via an accumulator line and is isolated from the RCS by a <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> isolation <b>valve</b> and two check valves in series...|$|R
40|$|The "Live Loading " of valve packing {{has been}} the topic of many {{articles}} and papers {{over the past few}} years. It has been highly recommended by some, and claimed to have no value by others. The truth is both statements can be correct. It all depends on the individual application. The problem is determining if a valve is a candidate for "Live Loading". In most cases this can be decided by answering a few questions! Is it a packed valve?! Does the valve cycle frequently?! Is it <b>motor</b> <b>operated?!</b> Is the <b>valve</b> difficult to get at?! Is the valve subject to high temperatures & pressures?! Is the valve in a critical application?! Does the valve have a history of packing leaks?! Does the valve have to be monitored under the new EPA regulations? If the answer to the first question and any of the others is yes, there is a good possibility that the valve in question is a candidate for live loading. Many different packing materials can and have been live loaded, but since the graphite based materials are the most commonly used in live load applications, the data referred to has been based on these materials. To understand how live loading works, let's first look at how belleville springs work, what live loading is, and when live loading can be used...|$|R
