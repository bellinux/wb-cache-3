5|$|The {{first and}} largest glacier was the Sherwin or Pre-Tahoe glacier, which eroded the upper Merced {{watershed}} {{to an extent}} close to its present form. Three stages followed during the Wisconsinian glaciation; these were the Tahoe, Tenaya and Tioga stages, of which the Tioga was the smallest. The Tioga glacier left {{at the mouth of}} Yosemite Valley a rocky moraine. This moraine was actually one of several moraines deposited by the four glaciations, which include <b>Medial</b> <b>Moraine</b> and Bridalveil Moraine. After the Tioga Glacier retreated this moraine formed a lake that flooded nearly the entire valley. Gradual sedimentation filled Lake Yosemite, creating a broad and flat valley floor. Sediments of glacial origin continued to travel down the Merced River following then, helping to form the flat floor of the Central Valley.|$|E

50|$|Till is the {{material}} that makes up ground, lateral and (not always present) <b>medial</b> <b>moraines.</b> Ground moraine consists of material that was once beneath the glacier and was transported by it and deposited across wide areas of the former glacier bed. The lateral moraines comprise that eroded material which is carried along {{at the sides of}} a glacier. A lateral moraine that is no longer being actively added to with glacial material because the glacier has retreated for climatic reasons, is known as a flank moraine. In the Alps the remaining flank moraines were usually formed during the Little Ice Age in medieval times. They lie several metres higher than the present glacier surface and extend far beyond the present glacier snouts. <b>Medial</b> <b>moraines</b> are formed when the lateral moraines of two glaciers are combined when they flow together.|$|R
50|$|Large {{amounts of}} rock debris are carried on, in, {{and beneath the}} ice as the glaciers move downslope. Lateral moraines are created as debris accumulates as low ridges of till that ride {{along the edge of}} the moving glaciers. When lateral moraines {{adjacent}} to each other join, they create <b>medial</b> <b>moraines,</b> which are also carried down on the surface of the moving ice.|$|R
50|$|Till is {{deposited}} at {{the terminal}} moraine, along the lateral and <b>medial</b> <b>moraines</b> {{and in the}} ground moraine of a glacier. As a glacier melts, especially a continental glacier, large amounts of till are washed away and deposited as outwash in sandurs by the rivers flowing from the glacier, and as varves (annual layers) in any proglacial lakes which may form.|$|R
50|$|A <b>medial</b> <b>moraine</b> is a {{ridge of}} moraine that {{runs down the}} center of a valley floor. It forms when two glaciers meet and the debris on the edges of the {{adjacent}} valley sides join and are carried on top of the enlarged glacier.

5000|$|Surges in Svalbard {{typically}} exhibit different behavior. Svalbard surges {{are typically}} associated with slower onset with an acceleration phase, rising to a maximum velocity which is typically slower (up to four or five meters per day) than Alaskan surges, {{and a return to}} quiessence often taking years.

50|$|Moraines can be {{classified}} either by origin, location {{with respect to a}} glacier or former glacier, or by shape. The first approach is suitable for moraines associated with contemporary glaciers—but more difficult to apply to old moraines, which are defined by their particular morphology, since their origin is debated. Some moraine types are known only from ancient glaciers, while <b>medial</b> <b>moraines</b> of valley glaciers are poorly preserved and difficult to distinguish after the retreat or melting of the glacier.|$|R

50|$|A moraine is any glacially formed {{accumulation}} of unconsolidated glacial debris (regolith and rock) {{that occurs in}} both currently and formerly glaciated regions on Earth (i.e. a past glacial maximum), through geomorphological processes. Moraines are formed from debris previously carried along by a glacier and normally consist of somewhat rounded particles {{ranging in size from}} large boulders to minute glacial flour. Lateral moraines are formed {{at the side of the}} ice flow and terminal moraines at the foot, marking the maximum advance of the glacier. Other types of moraine include ground moraines, till-covered areas with irregular topography, and <b>medial</b> <b>moraines</b> which are formed where two glaciers meet.|$|R
2500|$|Glacial moraines {{are formed}} by the {{deposition}} of material from a glacier and are exposed after the glacier has retreated. [...] They usually appear as linear mounds of till, a non-sorted mixture of rock, gravel and boulders within a matrix of a fine powdery material. Terminal or end moraines are formed at the foot or terminal end of a glacier. Lateral moraines are formed {{on the sides of}} the glacier. <b>Medial</b> <b>moraines</b> are formed when two different glaciers merge and the lateral moraines of each coalesce to form a moraine in the middle of the combined glacier. Less apparent are ground moraines, also called glacial drift, which often blankets the surface underneath the glacier downslope from the equilibrium line.|$|R
50|$|Holyoke Glacier, which {{heads in}} a large cirque and is fed by two glaciers from a small cirque on the south, has two weak <b>medial</b> <b>moraines</b> {{extending}} from spurs between its south tributaries. There are no lateral moraines, {{but there are a}} few morainic patches along the terminus. The glacier is longer than Barnard Glacier, and extends out over the lip of its hanging valley. In 1910, the glacier nowhere extended to the borders of its barren zone, and the mature spruce forest between the small terminal barren zone and the fiord demonstrates that it has not extended beyond this barren zone for a century or more. No distinct signs of recent advance were seen. The cliff glaciers on the ledges south of Holyoke Glacier present no unusual features.|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} view {{of primary}} community assembly is that colonisation by plants is essential before invertebrates can establish. It has been recognised, however, that invertebrates can establish before plants, {{and that they}} may be important in the first steps of community assembly. Plant succession is well studied but assembly of invertebrates and how their dispersal abilities affect the community assembly has, so far, gained less attention. The thesis adresses the questions: Does isolation decrease the rate of community assembly? Do invertebrates use corridors to direct their dispersal? What are the food resources of predators on new land? Is the assembly of communities more controlled by dispersal or the environment? Communities were studied along chronosequences on recently emerged nunataks (ice-free land in glacial areas) in Iceland. Each nunatak has a community assembly that starts with long distance dispersal from other terrestrial environments. This allowed a study on both local community and food web assembly, and on the effect of geographical isolation on this process. To determine ways of dispersal, invertebrates were collected on the glacier, lowland and on <b>medial</b> <b>moraines.</b> <b>Medial</b> <b>moraines</b> form corridors of debris on the glacier that stretch from the nunataks to the lowland. They directed the dispersal of flies that were moving over the glacier, to the nunataks and down to the lowland. When the rate of the community assembly on the nunataks was compared with that of non-isolated areas, no difference was observed. This indicates that isolation is not restricting the rate of community assembly, at least not of the first colonisers. Environmental gradients thus have a strong effect on the assembly of communities, compared to dispersal constraints. However, dispersal may restrict the colonisation of larger invertebrates, which are not as widespread on the nunataks. The first colonisers are small invertebrate predators and detritivores and when plants start to establish, more trophic groups can be added to the food webs, like herbivores and their predators. More invertebrates arrived at the nunataks than established and these may make up {{an important part of the}} food web, especially where primary productivity is lacking. By using the technique of stable isotopes, it was shown that early colonising predators feed on prey that is of a geographically distant origin. Perhaps, some of the predators are of a distant origin themselves. This thesis shows that dispersal abilities of many invertebrates is large and isolated areas are therefore not always as isolated as we may think...|$|R
