But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E

500|$|The entire sub-plot {{featuring}} Susanne Modeski {{caused a}} minor continuity error {{that had to}} be retconned.

During the filming of [...] "Unusual Suspects"—an episode that would largely feature Byers feeling a romantic connection to Susanne—Harwood removed his wedding ring, deducing that in 1989, when the episode took place, Byers had not been married yet.
