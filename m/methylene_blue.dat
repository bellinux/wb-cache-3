5|$|In 1891, Paul Guttmann and Ehrlich {{noted that}} <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> {{had a high}} {{affinity}} for some tissues and that this dye had a slight antimalarial property. <b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> and its congeners may act by preventing the biocrystallization of heme.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} supportive; gastric {{decontamination}} with activated charcoal {{may be beneficial}} if medical attention is sought {{within a few hours}} of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous <b>methylene</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E
5|$|Some {{bacteria}} produce intracellular nutrient storage granules {{for later}} use, such as glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates. Certain bacterial species, {{such as the}} photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vacuoles, vesicles which they use to regulate their buoyancy—allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. The gas vacuoles are freely permeable to gas. Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artefacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Inclusions {{are considered to be}} nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate. These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> or toluidine blue.Microcompartments are widespread, membrane-bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes. Carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved in carbon fixation. Magnetosomes are bacterial microcompartments, present in magnetotactic bacteria, that contain magnetic crystals.|$|E
25|$|In {{surgeries}} such as sentinel {{lymph node}} dissections, <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> {{can be used}} to visually trace the lymphatic drainage of tested tissues. Similarly, <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> is added to bone cement in orthopedic operations to provide easy discrimination between native bone and cement. Additionally, <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> accelerates the hardening of bone cement, increasing the speed at which bone cement can be effectively applied. <b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> is used as an aid to visualisation/orientation in a number of medical devices, including a Surgical sealant film, TissuePatch.|$|E
25|$|A color {{reaction}} in an acidified, aqueous <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> solution containing chloroform can detect anionic surfactants {{in a water}} sample. Such a test is known as an MBAS assay (<b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> active substances assay).|$|E
25|$|It {{can also}} be used as an {{indicator}} to determine whether eukaryotic cells such as yeast are alive or dead. The <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> is reduced in viable cells, leaving them unstained. However dead cells are unable to reduce the oxidized <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> and the cells are stained blue. <b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> can interfere with the respiration of the yeast as it picks up hydrogen ions made during the process.|$|E
25|$|In biology <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> {{is used as}} a dye for {{a number}} of {{different}} staining procedures, such as Wright's stain and Jenner's stain. Since it is a temporary staining technique, <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> {{can also be used to}} examine RNA or DNA under the microscope or in a gel: as an example, a solution of <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> can be used to stain RNA on hybridization membranes in northern blotting to verify the amount of nucleic acid present. While <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> is not as sensitive as ethidium bromide, it is less toxic and it does not intercalate in nucleic acid chains, thus avoiding interference with nucleic acid retention on hybridization membranes or with the hybridization process itself.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> {{has been}} used as a placebo; {{physicians}} would tell their patients to expect their urine to change color and view this as a sign that their condition had improved. This same side effect makes <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> difficult to test in traditional placebo-controlled clinical studies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> {{adsorption}} {{is reported}} in g/100g (range 11–28 g/100g).|$|E
25|$|Potential {{mediators}} include natural red, <b>methylene</b> <b>blue,</b> thionine and resorufin.|$|E
25|$|The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) of <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> is methylthioninium chloride.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> value {{reflects}} {{the amount of}} clay minerals in aggregate samples.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> {{combined}} with light {{has been used}} to treat resistant plaque psoriasis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> {{has been}} studied as an {{adjunctive}} medication inthe treatment of bipolar disorder.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> after {{the reaction of}} hydrogen sulfide with dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and iron(III) at pH0.4–0.7 is used to determine by photometric measurements sulfide concentration in the range 0.020 to 1.50mg/L (20ppb to 1.5ppm). The test is very sensitive and the blue coloration developing upon contact of the reagents with dissolved H2S is stable for 60min. Ready-to-use kits such as the Spectroquant sulfide test facilitate routine analyses. The <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> sulfide test is a convenient method often used in soil microbiology to quickly detect in water the metabolic activity of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). It should be observed that in this test, <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> {{is a product of}} reaction and not a reagent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> {{is used in}} {{endoscopic}} polypectomy as {{an adjunct}} to saline or epinephrine, and is used for injection into the submucosa around the polyp to be removed. This allows the submucosal tissue plane to be identified after the polyp is removed, which is useful in determining if more tissue needs to be removed, or if there has been a high risk for perforation. <b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> is also used as a dye in chromoendoscopy, and is sprayed onto the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract in order to identify dysplasia, or pre-cancerous lesions. Intravenously injected <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> is readily released into the urine and thus can be used to test the urinary tract for leaks or fistulas.|$|E
25|$|Genetically induced chronic {{low-level}} methemoglobinemia may {{be treated}} with oral <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> daily. Also, vitamin C can occasionally reduce cyanosis associated with chronic methemoglobinemia but has no role in treatment of acute acquired methemoglobinemia. Diaphorase normally contributes {{only a small percentage}} of the red blood cell's reducing capacity, but can be pharmacologically activated by exogenous cofactors (such as <b>methylene</b> <b>blue)</b> to 5 times its normal level of activity.|$|E
25|$|Blue urine can {{be caused}} by the {{ingestion}} of <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> (e.g., in medications) or foods or beverages with blue dyes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{literature}} has reported {{the use of}} <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> as an adjunct {{in the management of}} people experiencing vasoplegic syndrome after cardiac surgery.|$|E
25|$|Some carbons have a {{mesopore}} (20 Å to 50 Å, or 2 to 5nm) structure which adsorbs medium size molecules, {{such as the}} dye <b>methylene</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|E
25|$|Studies have {{indicated}} that Scolymus might {{be used for the}} bio-removal of cadmium, with the highest concentration measured over 50μg/g dry weight, and of <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> and Eriochrome Black T.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> was {{identified}} by Paul Ehrlich about 1891 {{as a possible}} treatment for malaria. It disappeared as an anti-malarial during the Pacific War in the tropics, since American and Allied soldiers disliked its two prominent, but reversible side effects: turning the urine blue or green, and the sclera (the whites of the eyes) blue. Interest in its use as an anti-malarial has recently been revived, especially due to its low price. Several clinical trials are in progress, {{trying to find a}} suitable drug combination. According to studies on children in Africa, it appears to have efficacy against malaria, but the attempts to combine <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> with chloroquine were disappointing.|$|E
25|$|There is {{tentative}} {{clinical evidence}} and good theoretical {{evidence of the}} benefit of lipid emulsion in severe overdoses of CCBs. <b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> may {{also be used for}} those with low blood pressure that does not respond to other treatments.|$|E
25|$|A {{traditional}} {{application of}} <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> is the intravital or supravital staining of nerve fibers, an effect first described by Paul Ehrlich in 1887. A dilute {{solution of the}} dye is either injected into tissue or applied to small freshly removed pieces. The selective blue coloration develops with exposure to air (oxygen) and can be fixed by immersion of the stained specimen in an aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate. Vital <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> was formerly much used for examining the innervation of muscle, skin and internal organs. The mechanism of selective dye uptake is incompletely understood; vital staining of nerve fibers in skin is prevented by ouabain, a drug that inhibits the Na/K-ATPase of cell membranes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> {{is also a}} {{photosensitizer}} used {{to create}} singlet oxygen when exposed to both oxygen and light. It is used in this regard to make organic peroxides by a Diels-Alder reaction which is spin forbidden with normal atmospheric triplet oxygen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> is a {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), and if infused intravenously at doses exceeding 5mg/kg, may precipitate serious serotonin toxicity, serotonin syndrome, if combined with any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other serotonin reuptake inhibitor (e.g., duloxetine, sibutramine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, imipramine).|$|E
25|$|A Phase 3 {{clinical}} trial of LMTM (TauRx0237 or LMT-X), a derivative of <b>methylene</b> <b>blue,</b> {{failed to show}} any benefit against cognitive or functional decline in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. Disease progression for both the drug and the placebo were practically identical.|$|E
25|$|For skin or eye exposure, the {{affected}} area is flushed with saline. For inhalation, oxygen is administered, bronchodilators may be administered, {{and if there are}} signs of methemoglobinemia, a condition that arises when nitrogen-based compounds affect the hemoglobin in red blood cells, <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> may be administered.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1876 by Heinrich Caro. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. In the United States, a 50mg vial costs about 191.40 USD. In the United Kingdom, a 50mg vial costs the NHS about £39.38.|$|E
25|$|Since its {{reduction}} {{potential is}} similar to that of oxygen and can be reduced by components of the electron transport chain, large doses of <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> are sometimes used as an antidote to potassium cyanide poisoning, a method first successfully tested in 1933 by Dr. Matilda Moldenhauer Brooks in San Francisco, although first demonstrated by Bo Sahlin of Lund University, in 1926.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of a strong reducing agent, such as ascorbic acid, to a sulfide-containing solution is sometimes used to prevent sulfide oxidation from atmospheric oxygen. Although it is certainly a sound precaution for the determination of sulfide with an ion selective electrode, it might however hamper {{the development of the}} blue color if the freshly formed <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> is also reduced, as described here above in the paragraph on redox indicator.|$|E
25|$|Inclusions are {{considered}} to be nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate. These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> or toluidine blue.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include headache, vomiting, confusion, {{shortness}} of breath, {{and high blood}} pressure. Other side effects include serotonin syndrome, red blood cell breakdown, and allergic reactions. Use often turns the urine, sweat, and stool blue to green in color. While use during pregnancy may harm the baby, not using in methemoglobinemia is likely more dangerous. <b>Methylene</b> <b>blue</b> is a thiazine dye. It works by converting the ferric iron in hemoglobin to ferrous iron.|$|E
25|$|MacConkey agar is a {{selective}} and differential medium used {{to differentiate between}} Gram-negative bacteria while inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. The addition of bile salts and crystal violet to the agar inhibits the growth of most Gram-positive bacteria, making MacConkey agar selective. Lactose and neutral red are added to differentiate the lactose fermenters, which form pink colonies, from lactose nonfermenters that form clear colonies. An alternative medium, eosin <b>methylene</b> <b>blue</b> serves a similar purpose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylene</b> <b>blue,</b> {{also known}} as methylthioninium chloride, is a {{medication}} and dye. As a medication, it is mainly used to treat methemoglobinemia. Specifically, {{it is used to}} treat methemoglobin levels that are greater than 30% or in which there are symptoms despite oxygen therapy. It has previously been used for cyanide poisoning and urinary tract infections, but this use is no longer recommended. It is typically given by injection into a vein.|$|E
