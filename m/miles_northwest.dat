5|$|M-106 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan in and {{near the city of}} Jackson. M-106 travels in a southwest-to-northeast direction from Jackson to Gregory at a junction with M-36 just a few <b>miles</b> <b>northwest</b> of Hell. The highway was first designated in 1928 running north out of downtown Jackson. It connected U.S. Highway12 (US12) to the state prison and Bunkerhill Road. A pair of changes in the early 1930s resulted in the extension eastward to Gregory. From the 1960s until {{the early years of the}} 21st century, a section of M-106 in downtown Jackson was routed along one-way streets.|$|E
5|$|At Taejon, the {{battered}} 24th Infantry Division {{was ordered to}} make a stand. The 34th Infantry also moved {{to the city to}} oppose the North Korean forces, which assaulted it head-on while attempting to flank and cut off retreat from the rear. Dean began ordering elements of the division, including much of his headquarters, to retreat via train to Taegu, although he remained behind. By this time, several M24 Chaffee light tanks had been sent to reinforce the division from A Company of the 78th Tank Battalion. Regardless of the additional tanks, on 20 July, North Korean armored units pushed American forces back from Taejon Airfield, several <b>miles</b> <b>northwest</b> of Taejon, overwhelming the last American units defending the Kum River and forcing the remnants of the division into Taejon itself. At this point the city was surrounded and North Korean troops began setting roadblocks along the roads out of the city.|$|E

5|$|The Camp Chapman {{attack was}} a suicide attack by Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi against the Central Intelligence Agency {{facility}} inside Forward Operating Base Chapman on December 30, 2009. FOB Chapman is located near the eastern Afghanistan city of Khost, which is about 10 <b>miles</b> <b>northwest</b> of the border with Pakistan. One of the main tasks of the CIA personnel stationed at the base was to provide intelligence supporting drone attacks against targets in Pakistan. Seven American CIA officers and contractors, an officer of Jordan's intelligence service, and an Afghan working for the CIA were killed when al-Balawi detonated a bomb sewn into a vest he was wearing. Six other American CIA officers were wounded. The bombing was the most lethal attack against the CIA in more than 25 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} from Alford {{to the heart}} of London in 1605 when Anne was 15, where her father was given the {{position}} of vicar of the Church of Saint Martin's in the Vintry. Here his expression of puritan views was tolerated, though somewhat muffled, because of a shortage of pastors. Marbury took on additional work in 1608, preaching in the parish of Saint Pancras, several <b>miles</b> <b>northwest</b> of the city, travelling there by horseback twice a week. In 1610, he replaced that position with one much closer to home and became rector of Saint Margaret's on New Fish Street, only a short walk from Saint Martin in the Vintry. He was at a high point in his career, but he died suddenly at the age of 55 in February 1611, when Anne was 19 years old.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to active service, the ship spent several months training officer cadets in the Baltic before serving as artillery {{support for the}} retreating German Army on the Eastern Front. After the German collapse in May 1945, she was surrendered to the British Royal Navy before being transferred to the US Navy as a war prize. After examining the ship in the United States, the US Navy assigned the cruiser to the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll. Having survived the atomic blasts, Prinz Eugen was towed to Kwajalein Atoll, where she ultimately capsized and sank in December 1946. The wreck remains partially visible above the water approximately two <b>miles</b> <b>northwest</b> of Bucholz Army Airfield, {{on the edge of}} Enubuj. One of her screw propellers was salvaged and is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial in Germany.|$|E
