5|$|Low-tech {{communication}} {{aids are}} defined as {{those that do not}} need batteries, electricity or electronics. These are often very simple communication boards or books, from which the user selects letters, words, phrases, pictures, and/or symbols to communicate a message. Depending on physical abilities and limitations, users may indicate the appropriate <b>message</b> <b>with</b> a body part, light pointer, eye-gaze direction, or a head/mouth stick. Alternatively, they may indicate yes or no while a listener scans through possible options.|$|E

25|$|Seurat however, elected not to {{make the}} real or {{imagined}} plight of the suburban workers his concern, instead portraying the labouring class and petit-bourgeoisie of Asnières and Courbevoie with dignity, and in a scene of lazy leisure.

25|$|As their {{communities}} grew, {{women and men}} shared leadership of the Shaker communities. Women preached and received revelations as the Spirit fell upon them.

25|$|Finally {{the deal}} was agreed, and Drake promised to spare what {{remained}} of the town and sail away from it if the ransom was paid promptly. Drake sent a delegation to the Spanish camp with a <b>message</b> <b>with</b> a black boy freed from slavery who had recently joined the English. The Spanish however thinking this as an insult stabbed and killed him which infuriated Drake so much that he had many Spaniards deliberately executed until the murderer was found dead or alive. The Spanish complied and bought the man to justice by hanging him in front of the city. The ransom was finally paid during the last days of January.|$|E
25|$|PGP {{supports}} {{message authentication}} and integrity checking. The latter {{is used to}} detect whether a message has been altered since it was completed (the message integrity property) and the former {{to determine whether it}} was actually sent by the person or entity claimed to be the sender (a digital signature). Because the content is encrypted, any changes in the message will result in failure of the decryption with the appropriate key. The sender uses PGP to create a digital signature for the <b>message</b> <b>with</b> either the RSA or DSA algorithms. To do so, PGP computes a hash (also called a message digest) from the plaintext and then creates the digital signature from that hash using the sender's private key.|$|E

25|$|These {{requests}} {{started a}} conflict between the French government and the Tunisian national movement, especially as party officials undertake a major action {{across the country to}} raise the people's awareness of their <b>message.</b> <b>With</b> the worsening of the economic crisis, Peyrouton wanted to avoid turmoil as the Neo Destour wanted an uprise of the population living in hard conditions. Thus, he responded with a series of measures destined to intimidate the movement. The repression that started was more and more violent: Peyrouton prohibited any nationalist and left wing newspaper, such as Tunis socialiste, L'Humanité and Le Populaire, on September 1, 1934. On September 3, raids were carried out as major party leaderships were arrested, that was both Destours and the communist party. They were placed under house arrest then sent to the military camp of Bordj le Bœuf, in the far South of Tunisia, before being freed two years later with the arrival of Resident-general, Armand Guillon.|$|E
25|$|It is 1972 and {{the message}} from the Andromeda Nebula has stopped transmitting. Fleming {{has been able to}} {{determine}} the correct formula to counteract the effects of the enzyme and save Dawnay. Fleming, Dawnay, Reinhart, and Judy now agree that Andromeda must be stopped – however, the military now has control over the project. Andromeda tries to kill Fleming but fails; she confesses to Fleming that she is a slave of the computer, which is working to take over humanity. Fleming gains entry to the computer room where he takes an axe to the machine, destroying it. Now free of the machine Andromeda is able to access the safe that contains the copies of the original <b>message</b> <b>with</b> the instructions for building the computer which she burns so that the machine cannot be rebuilt. She flees with Fleming to one of the islands near the base. Pursued by soldiers, they hide in a series of caves on the island. However, Andromeda is apparently killed when she falls into a deep pool. The dejected Fleming is brought back to Thorness by the soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Hermes was recommissioned on 7 May {{and loaded}} two unknown {{aircraft}} on 5 July, making nine flights with them before 14 July. For the trials she initially used a Borel Bo.11 and a Short Folder, but the Borel was damaged {{in a storm}} and replaced by a Caudron G.2 amphibian. This latter aircraft took off successfully while the ship was moving on 28 July, but the take-off platform only {{seems to have been}} used twice during this time. During the manoeuvers, she simulated a reconnaissance Zeppelin for the Red Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral John Jellicoe. The Folder could only a small wireless transmitter because of weight limits and it would be launched to search for search for enemy ships and report back to Hermes which would retransmit its <b>message</b> <b>with</b> its more powerful transmitter. The aircraft made a total of about 30 flight before 6 October. The tests showed that aircraft required radio transmitters to usefully perform reconnaissance, that sustained use of aircraft at sea was possible and that handling aircraft aboard ship and on the sea imposed their own set of requirements that could not be met by converted land-based aircraft.|$|E
