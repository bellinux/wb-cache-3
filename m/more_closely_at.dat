5|$|Two {{days after}} Brierre's death, the detectives have made little {{progress}} on their lead about Kaja, the victim's abusive ex-boyfriend. Ballard and Gharty suggest they look <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> Felix Wilson and his son, Hal (Jeffrey Wright), because Brierre had sex {{before her death}} and knew few men socially besides them. Pembleton and Gee, who are both very respectful of Felix Wilson's contributions to the African American community, dismiss the suggestion; Gee refuses to even ask the Wilsons to submit a blood and hair sample. The next day's Baltimore Sun runs {{a story about the}} investigation into Kaja, which Pembleton believes was leaked to the press by Gee in order to distance the Wilsons from the crime. Ballard and Gharty question Hal, who denies having sex with Brierre after tough questions from Gharty. After the interview, Gharty tells Ballard that Pembleton and Gee are obstructing the investigation to protect a rich and respected black family.|$|E

25|$|To look <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> this issue, Saffran Aslin and Newport {{conducted}} {{another study}} in which infants underwent the same training with the artificial grammar but then were presented with either words or part-words rather than words or nonwords. The part-words were syllable sequences composed of the last syllable from one word and the first two syllables from another (such as kupado). Because the part-words had been heard during the time when children were listening to the artificial grammar, preferential listening to these part-words would indicate that children were learning not only serial-order information, but also the statistical likelihood of hearing particular syllable sequences. Again, infants showed greater listening times to the novel (part-) words, indicating that 8-month-old infants were able to extract these statistical regularities from a continuous speech stream.|$|E

25|$|During 1932-33 Attlee flirted with, {{and then}} drew back from radicalism, {{influenced}} by Stafford Cripps {{who was then}} on the radical wing of the party, he was briefly {{a member of the}} Socialist League, which had been formed by former Independent Labour Party (ILP) members, who opposed the ILP's disaffiliation from the main Labour Party in 1932. At one point he agreed with the proposition put forward by Cripps that gradual reform was inadequate and that a socialist government would have to pass an emergency powers act, allowing it to rule by decree to overcome any opposition by vested interests until it was safe to restore democracy. He admired Oliver Cromwell's strong-armed rule and use of major generals to control England. After looking <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, and even his former colleague Oswald Mosley, leader of the new blackshirt fascist movement in Britain, Attlee retreated from his radicalism, and distanced himself from the League, and argued instead that the Labour Party must adhere to constitutional methods and stand forthright for democracy and against totalitarianism of either the left or right. He always supported the crown, and as Prime Minister was close to King George VI.|$|E

500|$|While most of {{the early}} reviewers of the Rights of Men, {{as well as most}} of Wollstonecraft's early biographers, criticized the work's emotionalism, and {{juxtaposed}} it with Burke's masterpiece of logic, there has been a recent re-evaluation of her text. Since the 1970s, critics who have looked <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> both her work and Burke's, {{have come to the conclusion}} that they share many rhetorical similarities, and that the masculine/logic and feminine/emotion binaries are unsupportable. Most Wollstonecraft scholars now recognize it was this work that radicalized Wollstonecraft and directed her future writings, particularly A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. It is not until after the halfway point of Rights of Men that she begins the dissection of Burke's gendered aesthetic; as Claudia Johnson contends, [...] "it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of Rights of Men she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career." ...|$|E

The Kalman gain is the relative weight given to the measurements and current state estimate, and can be [...] "tuned" [...] to achieve particular performance. With a high gain, the filter places more weight on the most recent measurements, and thus follows them more responsively. With a low gain, the filter follows the model predictions <b>more</b> <b>closely.</b> <b>At</b> the extremes, a high gain close to one will result in a more jumpy estimated trajectory, while low gain close to zero will smooth out noise but decrease the responsiveness.|$|E

2500|$|By November 1941, many of {{the initial}} assembly-line {{challenges}} had been met, which freed up time for the engineering team to tackle the problem of frozen controls in a dive. Lockheed had a few ideas for tests that would help them find an answer. The first solution tried was the fitting of spring-loaded servo tabs on the elevator trailing edge designed to aid the pilot when control yoke forces rose over , {{as would be expected}} in a high-speed dive. At that point, the tabs would begin to multiply the effort of the pilot's actions. The expert test pilot, 43-year-old Ralph Virden, was given a specific high-altitude test sequence to follow and was told to restrict his speed and fast maneuvering in denser air at low altitudes, since the new mechanism could exert tremendous leverage under those conditions. A note was taped to the instrument panel of the test craft underscoring this instruction. On 4 November 1941, Virden climbed into YP-38 #1 and completed the test sequence successfully, but 15 minutes later was seen in a steep dive followed by a high-G pullout. The tail unit of the aircraft failed at about [...] during the high-speed dive recovery; Virden was killed in the subsequent crash. The Lockheed design office was justifiably upset, but their design engineers could only conclude that servo tabs were not the solution for loss of control in a dive. Lockheed still had to find the problem; the Army Air Forces personnel were sure it was flutter and ordered Lockheed to look <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> the tail.|$|E
