40|$|The {{protocols}} {{presented here}} enable <b>the</b> proper <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latest-generation <b>instruments</b> for measuring <b>the</b> apparent optical properties (AOPs) <b>of</b> aquatic ecosystems. <b>The</b> protocols {{are designed for}} the Hybrid Sensors for Environmental AOP Sampling (HySEAS) class of instruments, but are applicable to <b>the</b> community <b>of</b> practice for AOP measurements. The protocols are organized into eleven sections beyond an introductory overview: a) cables and connectors, b) HySEAS instruments, c) platform preparation, d) instrument installation, e) cable installation, f) test deployment, g) test recovery, h) maintenance, i) shipping, j) storage, and k) smallboat operations. Each section concentrates on documenting how to prevent the most likely faults, remedy them should they occur, and accomplishing both with <b>the</b> proper application <b>of</b> a modest set of useful tools. Within the twelve sections, there are Socratic exercises to stimulate thought, and {{the answers to these}} exercises appear in Appendix A. Frequently asked questions (FAQs) are summarized in a separate section after the answers to the exercises in Appendix B. For practitioners unfamiliar with the nautical terms used throughout this document plus others likely encountered at sea, an abbreviated dictionary of nautical terms appears in Appendix C. An abbreviated dictionary of radiotelephone terms is presented in Appendix D. To ensure familiarity with many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tools that are presented, Appendix E provides a description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tools alongside a thumbnail picture. Abbreviated deployment checklists and cable diagrams are provided in Appendix F. The document concludes with an acknowledgments section, a glossary of acronyms, a definition of symbols, and a list of references...|$|R
