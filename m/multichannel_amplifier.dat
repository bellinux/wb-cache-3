40|$|Gastrointestinal (GI) {{motility}} is well organized. GI muscles act as {{a functional}} syncytium to achieve physiological functions {{under the control of}} neurones and pacemaker cells, which generate basal spontaneous pacemaker electrical activity. To date, it is unclear how spontaneous electrical activities are coupled, especially within a micrometre range. Here, using a microelectrode array, we show a spatio-temporal analysis of GI spontaneous electrical activity. The muscle preparations were isolated from guinea-pig stomach, and fixed in a chamber with an array of 8 × 8 planar multielectrodes (with 300 μm in interpolar distance). The electrical activities (field potentials) were simultaneously recorded through a <b>multichannel</b> <b>amplifier</b> system after high-pass filtering at 0. 1 Hz. Dihydropyridine Ca 2 + channel antagonists are known to differentiate the electrical pacemaker activity of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) by suppressing smooth muscle activity. In the presence of nifedipine, we observed spontaneous electrical activities that were well synchronized over the array area, but had a clear phase shift depending on the distance. The additional application of tetrodotoxin (TTX) had little effect on the properties of the electrical activity. Furthermore, by constructing field potential images, we visualized the synchronization of pacemaker electrical activities resolving phase shifts that were measurable over several hundred micrometres. The results imply a phase modulation mechanism other than neural activity, and we postulate that this mechanism enables smooth GI motility. In addition, some preparations clearly showed plasticity of the pacemaker phase shift...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of multiple sclerosis {{is the result}} of complex interactions between environmental factors, genetic factors that determine individual disease susceptibility, and immunological and physiological characteristics of the patient. multiple sclerosis treatment requires obtaining information about the main pathological processes, therefore, the evaluation of biochemical, immunological, and genetic markers of such processes, and not just clinical indicators, can become the basis of improved approaches for diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. Polymorphism of the disease-associated genes is considered as one of the key factors in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis, capable of influencing the risk of development, clinical manifestations and nature of the course of the disease, treatment response. The HLA genes polymorphism was found {{to be the most important}} and playing an essential role in the {{development of}} autoimmune diseases. There are data on the population characteristics of these types of polymorphisms, which require conducting relevant research in Ukraine and its regions to identify relevant genetic markers. The aim of the study was to provide a comparative clinical and immunological characteristic of multiple sclerosis patients in the northeastern region of Ukraine, depending on the presence of the disease-associated HLA-DR polymorphism. Materials and methods. 39 patients with multiple sclerosis, inhabitants of Kharkiv and Kharkiv region, were examined, of which 7 men and 32 women of medium age of 33. 7 ± 7. 7 and 42. 1 ± 11. 9 years, respectively; control group was consisted of 27 practically healthy persons of both sexes with an average age of 30. 1 ± 8. 2 years. Clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis patients included the determining the form and the actual type of the disease, its duration, and disability assessment based on the EDSS scale. The rate of the disease progression was determined as the ratio of the EDSS score to the duration of the disease. Biological material was blood and buccal epithelium samples from multiple sclerosis patients and practically healthy people. In addition to assessing the clinical status of the patients, design of the study also included evaluation of the systemic immunity indicators, levels of nonspecific and antinuclear antibodies in the serum, and analysis of HLA polymorphism, in particular, detection of the HLA-DR 15 haplotype for its specific marker SNP rs 9271366. Isolation of high molecular DNA was performed on a magnetically sensitive sorbent using the NeoPrep 100 DNA Magnet kit (NeoGene, Ukraine). SNP polymorphism rs 9271366 A/G was typed by the allele-specific amplification method with subsequent electrophoretic detection of the results. Primer selection was performed using the method by Liu Jing et al. (2012) adding a mismatch in the third position at the 3 ’ends. The primers MS 92 АF 5 `-CACGTAATATAA-ATGGTTGCAAAGGA- 3 `, MS 92 GF 5 `-CACGTAATATAAATGGTTGCA-AAGGG- 3 ` and MS 92 R 5 ` AACCCTGATGTAACAGA(C/T) CTCTA- 3 ` (Eurofins Genomics), as well as Taq-mut polymerase (Liteh, Russian Federation), were used in the study. The amplification was performed on the <b>multichannel</b> <b>amplifier</b> Tercyc (Russian Federation). Amplification mode: denaturation at 96 °C for 3 minutes and 35 cycles that included denaturation at 95 °C for 30 seconds, annealing at 58 °C for 30 seconds, and synthesis at 72 °C for 30 seconds. The length of the amplicon was 233 bp. Electrophoresis was performed in 2 % agarose gel in TAE buffer. Electrophoregram analysis was carried out on transilluminator UVT 1 (Biocom, Russian Federation). Serum IgM, IgG, IgA levels were evaluated by ELISA using a test system by NPL Granum (Ukraine) and the immunoassay analyzer Stat-Fax 303 (USA). The determination of peripheral blood lymphocytes subpopulations was carried out using the test systems by NPL Granum, Ukraine in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Circulating immune complexes in serum were evaluated by selective precipitation of antigen complexes with 3. 5 % PEG- 6000 solution (AppliChem GmbH, Germany). The content of lymphocytotoxic autoantibodies was determined by a lymphocytotoxic macrotest. The complementary activity of the blood serum was evaluated by means of 50 % of sheep erythrocytes hemolysis in the presence of homologous antibodies. The statistical treatment was performed using STATISTICA 11. 0 (StatSoft, Inc). To determine the reliability of the differences between the indexes in the studied samples, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney's criterion was used, while the Student's T-criterion was used for the normal distribution. Results. At the stage of clinical examination of multiple sclerosis patients, 25 patients (64. 1 %) were diagnosed with RRMS, 4 patients (10. 3 %) with PPMS, and another 10 persons (25, 6 %) with SPMS. The familial form of the disease was established in 11 cases (28. 2 %), in 28 cases (71. 8 %) the form of the disease was classified as sporadic. The average disease duration of the examined persons was 10. 16 ± 9. 57 years. The disability score assessed according to the EDSS scale was 3. 54 ± 1. 67 points; the rate of progression of the disease was 0. 93 ± 1. 26 and 0. 83 ± 0. 85 points, respectively. Analysis of the HLA polymorphism indicated that the disease-associated (minor) allele G SNP rs 9271366 was present in 43. 6 % of the subjects examined (haplotype AG, G+ group), and another 56. 4 % of the patients were homozygous by the major allele A (haplotype AA, G- group). The form of the disease, the EDSS score, and the rate of the disease progression in the examined patients did not have association with the allele G SNP rs 9271366. Patients with familial and sporadic forms of multiple sclerosis did not have significant differences in immune status and clinical indicators. The average EDSS score was 3. 45 ± 1. 95 points in G+ patients and 3. 65 ± 1. 26 points in G- patients and the rate of disease progression was 0. 83 ± 0. 85 points and 0. 93 ± 1. 26 points, respectively. The study of cellular immunity indicators revealed a decrease in relative number of CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes in multiple sclerosis patients compared to that in control group, and it was more pronounced in subjects with the presence of the SNP rs 9271366 minor allele. The relative content of CD 4 + cells was 28. 00 ± 3. 45 % in heterozygous patients, 30. 94 ± 4. 42 % in patients homozygous for allele A, in the control group 42. 3 ± 1. 8 % (p< 0. 05), and the CD 8 + cells content was 18, 55 ± 4. 08 %, 20. 65 ± 3. 52 % and 29. 4 ± 2. 2 %, respectively (p< 0. 05). At the same time, the reduction in the relative number of CD 4 + lymphocytes was observed in 90. 9 % of G+ patients, and in 64. 7 % cases in G- patients (p< 0. 05). Decreased CD 8 + lymphocyte content was also more common in patients with G+ (77. 3 % of cases) than in G- (41. 2 % of cases), p< 0. 05. Acute inflammatory process was determined in 38. 5 % of patients with multiple sclerosis, as evidenced by an elevated IgM level in 20. 5 % of cases, as well as an increase in complement activity in 62. 5 % of subjects. The levels of lymphocytotoxic autoantibodies in patients with multiple sclerosis were significantly higher compared to the control group (18. 33 ± 3. 67 % of subjects and 5. 82 ± 3. 12 % of subjects, respectively, p< 0. 05), and the levels of circulating immune complexes were elevated in 10. 3 % of patients. The study of the levels of antinuclear antibodies in multiple sclerosis patients revealed a diagnostically significant levels of antibodies to native DNA found in 92. 3 % of the cases, including all G + patients and 83. 3 % of G- patients. In this case, 16. 7 % of patients homozygous for allele A and 14. 3 % heterozygous patients were also positive for the presence of antibodies to denatured DNA. Similar results were also obtained concerning the presence of antibodies to formalinized DNA - 16. 7 % positive results in G- patients and 28. 6 % in G+ patients (p< 0. 05). At the same time, elevated levels of antibodies to native, denatured, and formalinized DNA were determined predominantly in patients with SPMS and PPMS (15. 4 % of the number of examined patients). The elevated levels of antinuclear antibodies may indicate an unfavorable course of the disease or its transition to the active phase. Conclusion. In the surveyed multiple sclerosis patients from the northeastern region of Ukraine, the prevalence of SNP rs 9271366 and its association with a decrease in the relative number of CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells against the background of elevated levels of antinuclear and lymphocytotoxic antibodies were detected...|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} the {{multichannel}} amplifer (MCA) has brought with it strigent intermodulation distortion (IMD) requirements. This thesis explores the issue of thirdorder intermodulation distortion (/M 3) in M C A ’s from two seperate viewpoints. Firstly, the prediction of IM 3 levels in MCA’s is investigated and a novel software based prediction tool is presented. The amplifier {{is viewed as a}} black-box nonlinear circuit and is characterised by carrying out an IMD test using 3 tones of equal amplitude. Then, by using the Volterra-series approach and linear interpolation, an IM :i prediction can be made for an arbitrary number of input tones of different amplitudes. To demonstrate and verify the capability of this technique predicted and measured results are compared for single and cascaded stages. Secondly and finally, a novel amplifier configuration which reduces these IM 3 levels and simultaneously improves the overall efficiency of the M C A is presented. This approach uses a scaled version of the extracted envelope of the mult-tone signal to actively bias the amplifier. This technique is of paramount importance in <b>multichannel</b> power <b>amplifier</b> (MCPA) design where an increase in linearity is usually achieved by a decrease in efficiency. Practical results are presented which illustrate the effectiveness of this technique...|$|R
40|$|Mode-locked {{semiconductor}} lasers are compact pulsed sources with ultra-narrow pulse widths {{and high}} repetition-rates. In order {{to use these}} sources in real applications, their performance needs to be optimised in several aspects, usually by external control. We experimentally investigate the behaviour of recently-developed quantum-dash mode-locked lasers (QDMLLs) emitting at 1. 55 μm under external optical injection. Single-section and two-section lasers with different repetition frequencies and active-region structures are studied. Particularly, {{we are interested in}} a regime which the laser remains mode-locked and the individual modes are simultaneously phase-locked to the external laser. Injection-locked self-mode-locked lasers demonstrate tunable microwave generation at first or second harmonic of the free-running repetition frequency with sub-MHz RF linewidth. For two-section mode-locked lasers, using dual-mode optical injection (injection of two coherent CW lines), narrowing the RF linewidth close to that of the electrical source, narrowing the optical linewidths and reduction in the time-bandwidth product is achieved. Under optimised bias conditions of the slave laser, a repetition frequency tuning ratio > 2 % is achieved, a record for a monolithic semiconductor mode-locked laser. In addition, we demonstrate a novel all-optical stabilisation technique for mode-locked semiconductor lasers by combination of CW optical injection and optical feedback to simultaneously improve the time-bandwidth product and timing-jitter of the laser. This scheme does not need an RF source and no optical to electrical conversion is required and thus is ideal for photonic integration. Finally, an application of injection-locked mode-locked lasers is introduced in a <b>multichannel</b> phase-sensitive <b>amplifier</b> (PSA). We show that with dual-mode injection-locking, simultaneous phase-synchronisation of two channels to local pump sources is realised through one injection-locking stage. An experimental proof of concept is demonstrated for two 10 Gbps phase-encoded (DPSK) channels showing more than 7 dB phase-sensitive gain and less than 1 dB penalty of the receiver sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Personnel {{working in}} a {{confined}} environment can be exposed to hazardous gases, and certain gases can be extremely dangerous even in concentrations as low as a few parts per billion. Nanosensors can be placed in multiple locations over a large area, thus allowing for more precise and timely detection of gas leaks. ASRC Aerospace and its research partners are developing nanosensors to detect various gases, including hydrogen, ammonia, nitrogen tetroxide, and hydrazine. Initial laboratory testing demonstrated the capability to detect these gases in concentrations lower than parts per million, and current testing is evaluating sensitivity at concentration levels three orders of magnitude lower. Testing and development continue to improve the response and recovery times and to increase {{the sensitivity of the}} devices. The development team is evaluating different coatings and electrodes to determine the optimum configuration for detecting and identifying a variety of gases. The small footprint of the nanosensors allows several devices to be placed into a single substrate. Each sensor is responsive in a different way to different gases. Embedding multiple devices into a single substrate results in better reliability and less frequent calibrations. The use of different coatings for individual elements of a multichannel sensor allows different gases to be identified. The sensor system is implemented by the use of a custom <b>multichannel</b> signal conditioner <b>amplifier</b> built on a small multichip module.

40|$|X-ray {{astronomy}} {{is gaining}} importance for studying X-ray space {{sources such as}} single and binary stars, neutron stars, supernovae and black holes. Due to atmospheric absorption, X-ray telescopes must operate in space on satellites. Among the causes limiting the resolution of modern telescopes are distortions in mirrors shape. An innovative approach for X-ray mirrors aims at correcting the shape errors by means of piezo-ceramic actuators glued {{to the back of}} the mirrors, thus creating an “active mirror”. In order to test the viability of shape correction, we fabricated [1] a prototype of a thin glass active mirror, sized 20 cm x 20 cm with a 400 um thickness (Fig. 1). The mirror can allocate up to 25 piezo actuators connected to the external driving electronics by means of conductive paths, created on the back of the mirror by metal evaporation followed by a microlithographic process for selectively etching the metal. We also designed and built [2] a modular <b>multichannel</b> voltage <b>amplifier</b> (Fig. 2), driving up to 16 piezo actuators. At beginning we considered several high voltage monolithic operational amplifiers (OP AMP), capable of managing the specified output voltages (± 70 V). However all of them had to be ruled out due to their high quiescent currents, giving around 0. 35 W power dissipation per channel. So we used a different approach. Each channel consists of two stages (Fig. 3). The first stage is a conventional OP AMP, powered by a ± 12 V dual supply. It drives in push-pull the control LED’s of two high voltage optocouplers (TLP 627 by Toshiba), whose output transistors are connected in series between the ± 70 V dual supply. It recalls a “totem pole” configuration, where the two optocouplers act as pull-up and pull-down devices. As the OP AMP driving stage operates at low voltages, its power consumption is quite low. Moreover, the output stage, based on optocouplers, has a very low bias current (around 0. 1 mA), giving a power consumption of about 15 mW per channel. The voltage feedback, derived from the output voltage, guarantees the desired signal amplification and linearity. The amplifier has an overall voltage amplification of 11 and a bandwidth limited to 100 Hz, adequate to the typical control signals used to drive the piezo actuators, which are generated by an external 16 channels, 16 bit resolution, USB digital to analog converter. The amplifier also includes a “high voltage“ power supply, based on a micropower isolated flyback converter (LT 8300 by Linear Technology). Using a dual output transformer with a 1 : 5 : 5 winding ratio, it produces a ± 70 V dual voltage output starting from a single 12 V supply, with a nominal maximum output current of 4 mA. The whole 16 channels piezo driver thus only needs a ± 12 V supply. Thanks to the adopted strategies, the total power consumption for the 16 channel voltage amplifier has been measured to be within 0. 5 W...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Pathological {{oscillations}} in {{the beta}} frequencies (8 - 30 Hz) {{have been found}} in the local field potentials of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and non-human primate models of PD 1. In particular, these synchronizations appear in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a common target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for medically intractable PD 2. DBS and dopamine replacement therapy have been shown to reduce these oscillations and ameliorate the motor symptoms of PD. To better understand the origin and mechanisms of these synchronizations, we performed in vitro multielectrode recordings from the rat basal ganglia that support the detection of synchronous activity from numerous neurons. Methods: 300 - 400 μm basal ganglia slices were obtained from Wistar rats (postnatal days 15 - 60) using a vibratome and warmed up to room temperature in a holding chamber. The slices were transferred onto a 3 D multielectrode array (Ayanda Systems) for recording and continuously perfused with carbogenated artificial cerebral spinal fluid at 36 °C. Neural signals were measured and filtered with a 60 channel <b>amplifier</b> (<b>Multichannel</b> Systems GmbH) and visualized in LabView. Action potentials were detected from the extracellular signal using a 5 standard deviation voltage threshold and sorted into different neuronal units using principal component analysis. Further signal analysis was performed in Matlab to analyze the neuronal firing patterns and measure the extent of synchronous firing. Results: Our preliminary results identified three distinct firing patterns in the STN and substantia nigra. Most neurons exhibited regular spike trains (60 %) while others were random (30 %) or bursty (10 %). The addition of dopamine however reduced the percentage of cells with bursty and random firing patterns. Additionally, we found a very low incidence of synchronizations. Taken together, these results form the basis with which to compare firing patterns in an animal model of PD. Conclusions: Multi-electrode array recordings from the basal ganglia can reveal changes in their neurophysiological properties and measure the amount of synchronization between different neurons. We intend to use this technique to investigate pathological firing patterns in the basal ganglia in a rotenone rat model of PD. Using a combination of chemical and electrical stimulation, we will explore contributions from different nuclei of the basal ganglia to the network behavior. This would allow us to build more realistic models of the basal ganglia and lead to better therapies for PD...|$|R
