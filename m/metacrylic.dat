The basic physics of positronium, positron and their interactions with matter are discussed, {{as well as the}} equip-ment required for a PAS experiment. A specific example, namely the grafting of low density polyethylene (LDPE) with acrylic acid (AA) and <b>metacrylic</b> acid monomers is used to illustrate the use of PAS for characterizing complex polymeric systems.

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{synthesis}} of new monomers on the basis of cyclic and heterocyclic acetylene alcohols. New monomers obtained by interaction chloride of <b>metacrylic</b> acid with the corresponding alcohols. Synthesized methacrylic esters of cyclic and O,S,N- containing heterocyclic acetylene alcohols, are defined by their physical-chemical properties, set the structure of the methods of IR, the DMR-spectroscopy. Thanks to the presence of several reactive centers (double, triple) communications and content of cyclohexane, piran, thiopiran, piperidino groups, these connections can be important convenient objects of study of chemical transformations and obtaining on their basis of a number of promising substances. </p...|$|E
40|$|Dielectric barrier {{discharge}} (DBD) -based plasma deposition at atmospheric pressure, using glycidyl methacrylate (GMA, <b>metacrylic</b> acid-[2, 3 -epoxy-propyl ester]) as {{a prototype}} precursor {{was investigated in}} order to evaluate the applicability of dielectric barrier discharges to obtain plasma polymers {{with a high degree}} of structural retention of the starting precursor. Using pulsed excitation of the discharge, up to about 90 % of the epoxy groups of GMA can be retained in plasma polymers obtainable at deposition rates in the order of 3 - 5 nm/s. Preliminary investigations of the mechanism of film formation under pulsed plasma conditions indicate that the reaction of intact monomer molecules with surface radicals generated during the pulses play a prominent role...|$|E
40|$|Polymeric {{nanoparticles}} {{obtained from}} synthetic polymers such as copolymers of methacrylic acid, acrylic esters or <b>metacrylics,</b> {{have been widely}} used in pharmaceuticals for encapsulation of drugs. These nanoparticles have the advantages of drug protection, controlled release, improved bioavailability and lower toxicity, resulting in greater comfort to patients and compliance to the treatment. The production of nanoparticles (nanospheres and nanocapsules) by polymerization of monomers is reviewed and discussed in this article, highlighting the technological parameters that affect the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, e. g. drug solubility, phase volume, pH of polymerization, molecular weight and monomer concentration, and the nature and concentration of the surfactant...|$|R

40|$|Phase-Transfer Catalysis (PTC) {{technology}} {{is used in}} the commercial manufacture and also in pollution mitigation treatment processes. In the paper is demonstrated the synthesis of esters of acrylic and <b>metacrylic</b> acids, which have wide applications in the industry for the synthesis of unique polymeric materials, by phase transfer catalysis method. It is necessary to notice that the synthesis of acrylic acids in PTC medium is more important because that compounds are more sensitive at acidic and basic conditions. Here is shown that the offered method has more advantages in comparison with the traditional methods. PTC is characterized by a higher degree of conversion of raw materials into useful products, smaller material and power resources consumption. The offered method for acrylic ester synthesis in comparison with the traditional methods has more advantages: higher process rates, mild reaction conditions, allowing lower energy costs, the complete elimination of hazardous and dangerous organic solvents, all leading to a sharp reduction of air pollution, and volume of generated wastewaters...|$|E
40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{the development of}} molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for the selective extraction of dimethoate (dmt) and deltamethrin (dm) from food matrices. To achieve this goal, the non-covalent methodology has been applied for the preparation of MIPs using <b>metacrylic</b> acid (MAA) as a functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) as cross-linkers in order to evaluate {{the influence of the}} nature of the cross-linker on the efficiency and selectivity of those MIPs for the target pesticides. Non-imprinted polymers (NIPs), which do not contain template, have been also prepared in parallel with the MIP synthesis using the same synthetic protocol to assess the specificity of the interactions. Chemical and physical characterization was carried out using conventional techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Morphological characterization of MIPs and NIPs has been also performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to assess the polymer’s surface topography. The performance of each polymer was evaluated by conducting binding property measurements, namely imprinting factor determinations and adsorption studies using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop novel colon-specific drug {{delivery}} systems with pH-sensitive swelling and drug release properties. Methacrylic-type polymeric prodrugs with different content levels of 5 -amino salicylic acid (5 -ASA) were synthesized by free radical copolymerization of <b>metacrylic</b> acid (MAA), polyethylene glycol monomethacrylate (PEGMA), and a methacrylic derivative of 5 -ASA (methacryloyloxyethyl 5 -amino salicylate [MOES]). The copolymers were characterized, and the drug content of the copolymers was determined. The effect of copolymer composition on the swelling behavior and hydrolytic degradation was studied in simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 1. 2) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH 7. 2). The swelling and hydrolytic behavior of the copolymers was dependent on the content of MAA groups and caused a decrease in gel swelling in SGF or an increase in gel swelling in SIF. Drug release studies showed that increasing content of MAA in the copolymer enhances the hydrolysis in SIF but has no effect in SGF. The results suggest that hydrogen-bonded complexes are formed between MAA and PEG pendant groups and that these pH-sensitive systems could be useful for preparation of a controlled-release formulation of 5 -ASA...|$|E
30|$|Eudragit (Eu) S 100 is an anionic {{copolymer}} {{derived from}} <b>metacrylic</b> acid and methyl metacrylate (1 : 2). It is non-soluble in acids and water, {{while it is}} soluble in a pH 7 solvent or higher alkaline circumstance (Higashi et al. 2015; Sharma et al. 2016). Eu polymers are nontoxic and food-grade polymers (Gibson et al. 2006; José 2006; Thakral et al. 2013). This material can help medicines to protect GI conditions and reach the colon, {{so it can be}} used as a secondary coverage for strengthening the microencapsulation as well as assuring targeting the release of probiotics in the colon, which is their major and functional place. Eu coating of chitosan capsules strengthens the beads and prevents the release of bacteria in the stomach. This improvement of bead’s stability may increase the count and viability of bacteria in the beads during GI lumen (Badhana et al. 2013; Boeris et al. 2009; Quan et al. 2008; Yoo et al. 2011). One important benefit of nanoparticles instead of Eu powder is the establishment of a thin nanosize layer around the beads. This very thin layer may improve the resistance of beads without enlarging the size of them (Pandey et al. 2016; Patel et al. 2015; Pourjafar et al. 2016; Yoo et al. 2011).|$|E
