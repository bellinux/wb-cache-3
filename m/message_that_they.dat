5|$|Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) {{continues}} to struggle in deciphering an encrypted Starfleet <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> previously obtained through the Hirogen relay system (""). Neelix (Ethan Phillips) returns to Voyager with a guest, Arturis (Ray Wise), {{who helped him}} obtain supplies. Arturis learns of the encoded message and offers to help decrypt it. He is successful, and finds that the message is from Starfleet Command, with a nearby set of coordinates where their means of getting back home can be found. Though {{the rest of the}} crew is elated at this news, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) remains cautious, given that the Borg have never been able to assimilate Arturis' species. Voyager arrives at the provided coordinates to find an unmanned Starfleet vessel, the Dauntless, of unknown design. Aboard, they find the ship uses quantum slipstream technology, which will allow them to arrive back in the Alpha Quadrant within a few months.|$|E

In addition to checking on Direction Island, there was also the potential that Emden and Königsberg had been operating together and that the second ship would approach to recover the attack party from the island, or go after the troop convoy; consequently, Sydney could not render assistance to Emdens survivors until such threats had passed. It was too late to make a landing on Direction Island, so the cruiser spent the night patrolling the islands, and approached the wireless station the next morning. On arrival, the Australians learned that the Germans had escaped the previous evening in a commandeered schooner.

In secrecy he also developed a plan with a consortium of Nantes privateers, funded by exiled Scots bankers and pawning of his mother's jewelry. They fitted out the 16-gun privateer Du Teillay and a ship of the line the Elisabeth and set out from Nantes for Scotland in July 1745 on the pretence that this was a normal privateering cruise, leaving a personal letter from Charles to Louis XV of France announcing the departure and asking for help with the rising. The Elisabeth, carrying weapons, supplies and 700 volunteers from the Irish Brigade, encountered the British Navy ship HMS Lion and with both ships badly damaged in the ensuing battle the Elisabeth was forced back, but the Du Teillay successfully landed Charles with his seven men of Moidart on the island of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides on 2 August 1745.|$|E

After JR awakens from his coma, Bianca becomes upset when she sees him, going into a fit of grief and attacking him for killing Marissa. Bianca leaves Pine Valley telling everyone she is going away for work, but she is shown visiting her sister Kendall, who appears to be ill.|$|E

Sayid plans to use black smoke as a signal, saying that [...] "this time, they will know that we are coming", a reference to the attacks in the first-season finale. When the boat reaches the Others' camp, Sayid finds it to be deserted. Meanwhile, Michael, Jack, Sawyer, Hurley and Kate engage in a gun battle with some Others that were following them, and Sawyer kills one. Jack confronts Michael about leading the group into a trap, and Michael confesses to the murders of Ana Lucia and Libby. They realize that Michael has led them to a location other than the beach, ruining their former plan to meet up with Sayid. There, they see a large pile of pneumatic tubes, suggesting that the reports sent out from the [...] discovered in the episode [...] "?" [...] had never been read. Shortly after the discovery of the tube pile, they hear whispers, and suddenly Sawyer, Kate, and Jack are incapacitated by electric darts. The hostages, bound and gagged, are brought to a dock, where it appears that the Others are led by Henry Gale (Michael Emerson). Gale keeps his bargain with Michael, returning his son, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), to him and giving them an old fishing boat with instructions to sail on a heading of 325 degrees until they are rescued. Michael threatens Henry that he could tell the outside world of the island's location. Henry responds by telling him that it wouldn't matter as they {{would not be able to}} find the island, should they return. He also gives Michael a counter-threat: if he did tell people of the island's location, people would know what he did to get his son back. Michael reluctantly accepts but asks who Henry and his people are, to which Henry responds [...] "We're the good guys, Michael". Michael uses the boat to get him and Walt off the island. Hurley is then released and sent back to the other survivors with a <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are to stay away from the Others' part of the island.

40|$|Obesity {{results from}} a complex {{interaction}} between diet, physical activity, and the environment. The {{purposes of this study}} were to identify behaviors associated with resilience to childhood obesity, and to compare the sensitivity of the Figure Rating Scales (FRS) in reflecting Body Mass Index (BMI). Fifty health professionals in nutrition and 35 low-income, parent-and-child pairs completed the study. Children aged 6 - 11, perceived as “normal-weight” by their parents, were recruited. Five children had a measured BMI above the 85 th percentile. Using a picture-sort method, each participant responded to a series of questions about 13 childhood obesity-related messages. Results included comparison between health professionals, parents, and children about 1) familiarity toward each message, 2) frequency in following the recommendation, 3) perception of ease for others to follow, and 4) perception of effectiveness to help prevent childhood obesity. Health professionals and parents had similar familiarity regarding all 13 messages. However, in terms of practicality, health professionals and parents differed significantly in eight <b>messages</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> reported “always taught/followed,” seven <b>messages</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> “sometimes taught/followed,” and two <b>messages</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> “seldom or never taught/followed. ” In most messages, children’s observation about what the family followed differed from what parents reported following. In terms of ease for others to follow “Watch portion sizes” and “Tell children to eat all of the meal before getting dessert,” health professionals and parental perception differed significantly. In terms of effectiveness in childhood obesity prevention, health professionals and parents agreed on 12 of 13 messages. Health professionals did not find message “Tell children to eat all of the meal before getting dessert” to be effective in preventing childhood obesity, whereas parents did. FRS and measured BMI were significantly correlated among health professionals (r= 0. 75), parents (r= 0. 72), and children (r= 0. 53 for children ages 8 - 11, r= 0. 64 when a mother selected a silhouette for her child). For different subgroups, parent-and-child silhouette selection was closely correlated (r= 0. 84). However, correlation between child’s BMI percentile and silhouette was nonsignificant in most subgroups (r= 0. 47). In conclusion, FRS was effective among adults and older children (aged ≥ 8) in reflecting BMI but not among younger children (aged 6 - 7) ...|$|R
