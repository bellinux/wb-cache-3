50|$|Adam Stoltman {{wrote for}} the New York Times that in Fault Lines:Through a series of {{haunting}} architectural and landscape scenes of Turkey's rush toward modernization - and the resulting tension between the secular and the modern - <b>George</b> <b>Georgiou</b> has visually {{put his finger on}} a kind of listless alienation which at times can seem to pervade globalized society.|$|R

6000|$|Five minutes afterward, the {{carriage}} which <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> had engaged {{arrived at the}} door. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and the children came down the stairs. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George,</b> {{as soon as he}} reached the lower hall, inquired,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo did so. He {{followed}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> down {{stairs to}} the door, and they both got into a small carriage which <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> had waiting there and drove away together towards <b>Mr.</b> <b>George's</b> hotel.|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{pointed it}} out to <b>Mr.</b> <b>George.</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> {{said it was a}} cardinal's carriage.|$|R
60|$|It is one <b>Mr.</b> <b>George,</b> it appears. Without other {{announcement}} or ceremony, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> walks in.|$|R
60|$|The {{commissioner}} {{knocked at}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>George's</b> {{door at the}} time appointed. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo were both ready. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> counted out the fifteen guilders on the table, and James put them in his pocket. The party then set out.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>George</b> {{liked and}} admired Lucinda. Now, when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>George</b> liked and admired any person, {{it was a}} matter of {{necessity}} with her to impart her opinions to the most convenient confidant. In this case it was Romney Penhallow to whom <b>Mrs.</b> <b>George</b> remarked sweetly: ...|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{he looked}} into <b>Mr.</b> <b>George's</b> face, and waited to see if <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> had any {{objection}} to his going.|$|R
60|$|So Henry {{assisted}} Rollo to dismount, {{and then}} adjusted the stirrups to <b>Mr.</b> <b>George's</b> use, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> mounted into the saddle.|$|R

60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> acceded to this proposal. The {{raspberries}} {{were two}} groschen a basket. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> gave Rollo the money, and Rollo, going forward with it, bought the raspberries, {{and he and}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> ate them up together. They served the double purpose of a punishment for the offence, and of a dessert for the dinner.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo took a cab {{and rode}} towards the city. Just after passing Temple Bar, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> {{got out of the}} cab and went into an office. Rollo got out too, and amused himself walking up and down the sidewalk, looking in at the shop windows, while <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> was doing his business.|$|R
60|$|Having {{cast his}} sharp eye all about it, Mr. Bucket {{returns to his}} chair next his friend <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and pats <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> affectionately on the shoulder.|$|R
60|$|MENTEITH. To be sure, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George.</b> (He goes out. Third cravat a success. Re-enter MENTEITH.) He says, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George,</b> {{that he has}} {{an errand}} from Miss Musgrave.|$|R
6000|$|The officer, {{finding the}} {{carriages}} generally full, said to <b>Mr.</b> <b>George,</b> in French, [...] "Wait a moment, sir." [...] So <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> {{said to the}} rest of the party-- ...|$|R
60|$|One morning while <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo {{were taking}} breakfast {{together}} {{in the dining room}} of the hotel, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> remarked that he had received some news that morning.|$|R
6000|$|Philippe {{then asked}} if the party would stop on the way and go down into Herculaneum. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> said that they would. Philippe then went on with his calculation, {{and when it was}} {{finished}} he presented it to <b>Mr.</b> <b>George.</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> wrote a heading to it, and then read it as follows, except that I give the amounts in American money:-- ...|$|R
60|$|But I {{must go back}} to <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo. The coachman {{stopped at}} a large hotel, {{fronting}} upon this square. On inquiring at the bureau, (on the continent of Europe they call an office a bureau) <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> found that all the rooms were occupied except one large apartment, of four rooms. This was, of course, more than <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> wanted.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo had no baggage, {{except a}} valise which they carried {{with them in}} the carriage. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> took this valise up and stepped down upon the platform.|$|R
60|$|In {{about half}} an hour Rollo came up and told <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> that the dinner was ready. So <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> went down into the coffee room, Rollo showing him the way.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Parkman seemed {{extremely}} {{unwilling to}} allow <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> {{to pay any}} thing at all; but <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> insisted upon it, and so the bill was paid by a joint contribution.|$|R
60|$|So <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo walked on, {{and about}} half an hour {{afterwards}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> engaged lodgings in a place near the junction of the Strand with Charing Cross, called Northumberland Court.|$|R
6000|$|When <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo {{reached their}} hotel, and had got fairly {{established}} in their room, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> took his cane {{and prepared to}} [...] "go exploring," [...] as he called it.|$|R
60|$|So, taking <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> by the hand, he led {{him along}} {{to the brink of}} the pier. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> looked over, and saw the steamer lying at rest in its muddy bed below.|$|R
60|$|While <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo were at {{the table}} {{drinking}} their coffee, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> asked Rollo what he supposed the porter meant {{by saying that the}} eleven o'clock boat was a tidal boat.|$|R
6000|$|So <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and the {{children}} got into the carriage, the driver holding {{the door open for}} them as they did so. As the driver was about to shut the door, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> said,-- ...|$|R
