They were in close negotiations with what would become Oneworld, but pulled out in the last minute. There were two main concerns: the first was that Maersk would have to become a franchise partner of British Airways, and that they had already started negotiating with SAS.|$|E

500|$|As the {{previously}} prolific band were unusually quiet, the UK music press began to speculate. Melody Maker {{calculated that the}} total recording cost had come close to £250,000; however, McGee, Green, and Shields dispute this. Shields argued that that estimated cost (and Creation's near-bankruptcy) was a myth exaggerated by McGee because the Creation owner [...] "thought it would be cool." [...] According to Shields, [...] "The amount we spent nobody knows because we never counted. But we worked it out ourselves just by working out how much the studios cost and how much all the engineers cost. 160 thousand pounds was the most we could come to as the actual money that was spent." [...] In Green's opinion, the Melody Maker's estimate erred on the low side, by £20,000. He said, [...] "Once you'd even got it recorded and mixed, {{the very act of}} compiling, EQ-ing, etcetera took weeks on its own." [...] In a December 1991 interview, Shields said that most of the money claimed to have been spent on the album was simply [...] "money to live on" [...] over three years, with the album itself only costing [...] "a few thousand". He also claimed that the album represented only four months work over two years. Shields later said that most of the money spent was the band's own money, and that [...] "Creation probably spent fifteen to twenty thousand pounds of their own <b>money</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> and that's it. They never showed us any accounts, and then they got bought out by Sony." ...|$|E
500|$|Musician and ambient music pioneer Brian Eno has {{praised the}} album and said, {{regarding}} the song [...] "Soon", that [...] "t {{set a new}} standard for pop. It's the vaguest music ever {{to have been a}} hit." [...] Robert Smith of The Cure discovered Loveless after a period of almost exclusively listening to [...] "disco, or Irish bands like the Dubliners" [...] as a means of avoiding his contemporaries, and said, [...] " [...] was the first band I heard who quite clearly pissed all over us, and their album Loveless is certainly one of my all-time three favourite records. It's the sound of someone [...] who is so driven that they're demented. And the fact that they spent so much time and <b>money</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> is so excellent." [...] Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins told Spin, [...] "It's rare in guitar-based music that somebody does something new [...] At the time, everybody was like, 'How the fuck are they doing this?' And, of course, it's way simpler than anybody would imagine." [...] Trey Anastasio of jam band Phish believed that [...] "Loveless [...] the best album recorded in the '90s", and wanted his band to cover the album in its entirety for a Halloween show. Robert Pollard of indie rock band Guided by Voices acknowledged the album as a source of inspiration, noting, [...] "Sometimes when I want to write lyrics, I'll listen to Loveless. Because of the way the vocals are buried, you can almost listen to the songs as if they're instrumental pieces." [...] Loveless has also been said by Jim DeRogatis to have been a considerable influence on British band Radiohead.|$|E

They also praised Coleman's performance as [...] "explosive and mouth-gapingly compelling" [...] and summarised the episode as [...] "grown-up sci-fi at its best".|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Mark Walport, the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser {{and head}} of the Government Office for Science, had this to say: [...] "My view scientifically is {{absolutely}} clear: homoeopathy is nonsense, it is non-science. My advice to ministers is clear: that there is no science in homoeopathy. The most it can have is a placebo effect – it is then a political decision whether they spend <b>money</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> or not." [...] His predecessor, John Beddington, referring to his views on homeopathy being [...] "fundamentally ignored" [...] by the Government, said: [...] "The only one [...] I could think of was homoeopathy, which is mad. It has no underpinning of scientific basis. In fact, all the science points {{to the fact that it}} is not at all sensible. The clear evidence is saying this is wrong, but homoeopathy is still used on the NHS." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Witham Navigation {{was soon}} needing repairs, and the commissioners asked John Rennie for advice in 1802. His report, {{published}} in 1803, included recommendations to demolish High Bridge {{so that a}} waterway [...] wide could be built under a new bridge, and improvements to the Fossdyke costing £12,260. Neither action was followed. The Fossdyke was difficult to maintain, because much of it ran through sand and quicksand. The situation was more complex, {{because it had been}} leased to the Ellisons for three generations, and Richard Ellison III was not keen to spend any <b>money</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Income from tolls would have more than covered repairs, but there was little that could be done. A challenge to the legality of his lease was considered in the 1820s, but was not thought likely to succeed. He died in 1827, and Humphrey Sibthorp, his niece's husband, who was a proprietor on the River Witham, took over responsibility for it. He asked Isambard Brunel to survey it, and although he did so in 1833, no improvements were made.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, Murdoch {{entered the}} British {{newspaper}} market with his {{acquisition of the}} populist News of the World, followed in 1969 with {{the purchase of the}} struggling daily broadsheet The Sun from IPC. Murdoch turned The Sun into a tabloid format and reduced costs by using the same printing press for both newspapers. On acquiring it, he appointed Albert 'Larry' Lamb as editor and – Lamb recalled later – told him: [...] "I want a tearaway paper with lots of tits in it". In 1997 The Sun attracted 10 million daily readers. In 1981, Murdoch acquired the struggling Times and Sunday Times from Canadian newspaper publisher Lord Thomson of Fleet. Ownership of The Times came to him through his relationship with Lord Thomson, who had grown tired of losing <b>money</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> as a result of much industrial action that stopped publication. In the light of success and expansion at The Sun the owners believed that Murdoch could turn the papers around. Harold Evans, Editor of the Sunday Times from 1967, was made head of the daily Times, though he stayed only a year amid editorial conflict with Murdoch.|$|E

2500|$|Brennan (who was now {{a senior}} at Homestead) did not have plans to attend college, and was {{supportive}} of Jobs {{when he told her}} he planned to drop out of Reed because {{he did not want to}} spend his parents' <b>money</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> (neither her father nor Jobs's adoptive parents had gone to college). He continued to attend by auditing classes, including a course on calligraphy taught by Robert Palladino, but since he was no longer an official student, Brennan stopped visiting him. Jobs later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented near the Reed campus, but she refused. He had started seeing other women, and she was interested in someone she met in her art class. Brennan speculates that the house was Jobs's attempt to make their relationship monogamous again. In a 2005 commencement speech for Stanford University, Jobs states that during this period, he slept on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returned Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple. In that same speech, Jobs said: [...] "If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts." ...|$|E
