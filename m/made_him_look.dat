His gaze into TV cameras <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> helpless. When attacked, e.g. in election campaigns, he became a good fighter. But in general he was no great orator, his speeches were lengthy and verbose. Additionally, the catholic with his Palatinate dialect, a folksy man who had culture but was simply no intellectual - to North German journalists (like from the important newspapers made in Hamburg) he just felt foreign, more than any previous CDU chairman.|$|E
25|$|An {{unintended}} {{consequence of the}} attack on Melo was that Paraguay declared war on Brazil in late 1864. The Paraguayans invaded the provinces of Mato Grosso (present-day Mato Grosso do Sul) and Rio Grande do Sul. José Luís served in the Siege of Uruguaiana which resulted, in September 1865, in the surrender of an entire Paraguayan army which had taken the Brazilian town of Uruguaiana. On 22 March 1866, José Luís was given command of the 2nd cavalry division, a part of the 1st army corps. He fought in the Battle of Estero Bellaco on 2 May and in the First Battle of Tuyutí on 24 May. At Tuyutí José Luís was shot in the face with the bullet's trajectory entering one cheek and exiting through the other. He was left with hideous scars that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like he had a grim smile in his face. Tall and lean, José Luís seemed unpleasant at first glance, an impression that the disfigurement only worsened. He was actually a kind and warm person, according to historian Gustavo Barroso, who as commander knew how to impose a strict discipline without hurting the pride of his subordinates.|$|E
25|$|His career skyrocketed when Kido {{magazine}} {{named him}} the Number One Young Player. His power and composure shone through his strong endgame. He barely lost {{out in the}} final of the 22nd Nihon Ki-In Championship to Eio Sakata after making a critical mistake that led to his resignation. This loss fueled him to take the 12th Asahi Pro Best Ten undefeated, which <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> incredibly powerful, as all the opponents were 9-dan. The victory made him the youngest title holder ever in Japan. He lost {{in the second round of}} the 30th Honinbo preliminary to Toshihiro Shimamura 9-dan. Even though he had a second chance to take the match against Masao Kato—due to a triple ko—he still lost. He was on a roll in the 1st Tengen league, until he was defeated by Shuzo Ohira. He didn't get far in the rest of the tournaments that year. His spirits were high after he was promoted to 7 dan in late October, only to be crushed a month later when his teacher, Kitani, died. His record was a formidable 39 wins and 16 losses for the year.|$|E

500|$|Following the game, Burrows accused Auger {{of having}} a {{personal}} vendetta against him for a play against the Predators the previous month that had <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> bad. After Burrows had been hit into the boards by Nashville forward Jerred Smithson during a game on December 8, 2009, Auger assessed Smithson with a five-minute major and a game misconduct. However, the league later rescinded because it was believed Burrows had embellished injury. Burrows claimed that Auger told him before the January 11 game: [...] "you made me look bad [...] so I'm {{going to get you}} back tonight." [...] He went on to tell reporters that Auger [...] "should stay out {{for the rest of the}} year making calls like that ... We just blew two points because of his officiating tonight." ...|$|E

500|$|As each {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} new characters, the writers {{were able to}} attract actors {{who might have been}} unwilling to commit to an entire series. [...] "Nana's Party" [...] featured Claire Skinner as Angela, who is hosting a party. Pemberton and Shearsmith lived close to Skinner, but they had not properly met. She was one of several members of the cast of the film Life Is Sweet (others being Alison Steadman and Jane Horrocks) who have starred in Inside No. 9. Skinner enjoyed the [...] "funny" [...] script and her [...] "nice" [...] character. Eve Gordon (trained at the Nottingham Television Workshop) starred as Angela's daughter Katie, and Pemberton starred as Angela's husband Jim. Pemberton and Shearsmith suggested that Pemberton's costume <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Mr Chow Mein, a Benny Hill character.|$|E
500|$|The Persona 3 protagonist was {{the first}} {{character}} Shigenori Soejima designed for the game. Early designs of the character <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> mature and collected since the artist viewed him as a [...] "cliche cool guy." [...] Soejima took longer to design the protagonist than any other character as the game's other characters would be made to complement his design. In Art of Persona 3, Soejima remarked that [...] "Initially, he looked more honest, like an ordinary, handsome young man. But, I worked to achieve greater ambiguity in his expression." [...] He further noted that the character managed to have a [...] "hidden coolness." [...] In retrospect, {{he found that the}} character was not ambiguous enough and thus when creating the [...] protagonist, Soejima made Yu Narukami with the idea that his entire personality be decided and portrayed by the player's in-game actions and decisions.|$|E
500|$|Prior to his {{involvement}} in Re:Zero, illustrator Shinichirou Otsuka worked on video games, which led him to draw the backgrounds first when illustrating the series. [...] After reading the web novel, he submitted a number of character designs for the major characters to Ikemoto. [...] 's initial design <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like a delinquent, with Otsuka later describing it as [...] "not {{the face of a}} boy in his teens", leading Ikemoto to request that the character be [...] "more friendly and less fierce" [...] so that the audience could empathize with him during emotional scenes. [...] Originally, 's character design appeared extremely plain, so a number of features were added to make her more interesting. [...] Ikemoto specified that she must fit the [...] "archetypal heroine" [...] mold. Rem and Ram also underwent significant changes from the first draft: their original designs lacked the characteristic hair parts, and their maid uniforms were longer and more [...] "traditional".|$|E

500|$|In 1962, Steiger {{appeared}} on Broadway in Moby Dick—Rehearsed, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, {{as well as}} playing a detective searching for a scientist's (Alan Ladd's) mugger in Philip Leacock's 13 West Street for Columbia Pictures. Steiger {{played the role of}} a destroyer commander in the large ensemble cast of The Longest Day, which included John Wayne, Richard Todd, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Sean Connery and Henry Fonda. According to co-star Richard Burton, Steiger had admitted to him that he was in financial trouble at the time and had had a face lift, which Burton thought <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like [...] "one half of a naked ass-hole". The following year, Steiger played ruthless Neapolitan land developer and city councilman Edoardo Nottola, who uses his political power to make personal profit in a large scale suburban real estate deal, in Francesco Rosi's Italian production, Hands over the City (1963). According to biographer Francesco Bolzoni, Rosi had cast Steiger in the Italian language film because he had wanted [...] "a rich interpreter of great capacity" [...] in the part of the land developer.|$|E
500|$|Lucas based the CGI on the {{character}} as he originally appeared in Return of the Jedi. In this film, Jabba the Hutt is an immense, sedentary, slug-like creature designed by Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic Creature Shop. Design consultant Ralph McQuarrie claimed, [...] "In my sketches Jabba was huge, agile, sort of an apelike figure. But then the design went into another direction, and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature." [...] According to the 1985 documentary From Star Wars to Jedi, Lucas rejected initial designs of {{the character}}. One made Jabba appear too human—almost like a Fu Manchu character—while a second <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> too snail-like. Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two, drawing for further inspiration on an O'Galop cartoon figure flanking an early depiction of Bibendum (also known as the [...] "Michelin Man"). Return of the Jedi costume designer Nilo Rodis-Jamero commented, My vision of Jabba was literally Orson Welles when he was older. I saw him as a very refined man. Most of the villains we like are very smart people. But Phil Tippett kept imagining him {{as some kind of}} slug, almost like in Alice in Wonderland. At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like a slug that's smoking. I kept thinking I must be really off, but eventually that's where it led up to." ...|$|E
500|$|Just {{over two}} weeks after the convention, it was {{revealed}} that Eagleton had been hospitalized and received electroshock therapy for [...] "nervous exhaustion" [...] and [...] "depression" [...] several times during the early to mid-1960s (years later, Eagleton's diagnosis was refined to bipolar II disorder). McGovern initially supported Eagleton, in part because he saw parallels with his daughter Terry's battles with mental illness, and on the following day, July 26, stated publicly, [...] "I am 1,000percent for Tom Eagleton and have no intention of dropping him from the ticket." [...] Though many people still supported Eagleton's candidacy, an increasing number of influential politicians and newspapers questioned his ability to handle the office of vice president and, potentially, president or questioned the McGovern campaign's ability to survive the distraction. The resulting negative attention – combined with McGovern's consultation with preeminent psychiatrists, including Karl Menninger, as well as doctors who had treated Eagleton – prompted McGovern to accept, and announce on August 1, Eagleton's offer to withdraw from the ticket. It remains the only time a major party vice-presidential nominee has been forced off the ticket. Five prominent Democrats then publicly turned down McGovern's offer of the vice presidential slot: in sequence, Kennedy again, Abraham Ribicoff, Humphrey, Reubin Askew, and Muskie (Larry O'Brien was also approached but no offer made). Finally, he named United States Ambassador to France Sargent Shriver, a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy. McGovern's 1,000 percent statement and subsequent reneging <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> both indecisive and an opportunist, and has since been considered one of the worst gaffes in presidential campaign history. McGovern himself would long view the Eagleton affair as having been [...] "catastrophic" [...] for his campaign.|$|E
