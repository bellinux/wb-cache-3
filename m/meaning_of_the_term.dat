5|$|In the {{clinical}} sense, a disorder {{is a condition}} requiring treatment as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. There {{is a lack of}} consensus about the precise <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> 'attachment disorder' although there is general agreement that such disorders only arise following early adverse caregiving experiences. Reactive attachment disorder indicates the absence of either or both the main aspects of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure. This can occur either in institutions, or with repeated changes of caregiver, or from extremely neglectful primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs after the age of 6 months. Current official classifications of RAD under DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 are largely based on this {{understanding of the nature of}} attachment.|$|E
25|$|This general, non-specific, <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Amesha Spenta {{also has}} an {{equivalent}} in the Vedic Sanskrit Vishve Amrtas, which is the collective term for all supernatural beings (lit: 'all immortals').|$|E
25|$|Three-dimensional space (also: 3-space or, rarely, tri-dimensional space) is a {{geometric}} {{setting in}} which three values (called parameters) are required to determine the position of an element (i.e., point).

25|$|The <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> {{is quite}} {{different}} from that implied in partnership, and it is because of the potential for confusion between the two that widespread use of 'business partner' has been discouraged at times in the past.|$|E
25|$|Independently, {{as a third}} <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term,</b> {{the shape}} of the Airy disk {{resulting}} from the wave diffraction on a circular aperture is sometimes also denoted as the Airy function (see e.g. here). This kind of function is closely related to the Bessel function.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{conventionally}} known continents, {{the scope and}} <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> continent varies. Supercontinents, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than one craton or continental core. These have included Laurasia, Gondwana, Vaalbara, Kenorland, Columbia, Rodinia, and Pangaea.|$|E

25|$|Urban-type {{settlement}} extends {{far beyond}} the traditional boundaries of the city proper in a form of development sometimes described critically as urban sprawl. Decentralization and dispersal of city functions (commercial, industrial, residential, cultural, political) has transformed the very <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> and has challenged geographers seeking to classify territories according to an urban-rural binary.|$|E
25|$|Decibels {{are still}} the {{commonly}} used units to express ratios {{in a number of}} fields, even when the original <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> is obscured.

25|$|Early old {{age is a}} {{pleasant}} time; children are grown, retirement from work, time to pursue interests. Many people are also willing {{to get involved in}} community and activist organizations to promote their well-being.

25|$|Italy ceded Dodecanese islands to Greece {{with the}} 1947 Treaty of Paris. Article 14 enumerates the islands to be {{transferred}} to Greek sovereignty, and states that adjacent islets are {{to be transferred}}. Turkish and Greek sides dispute the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term.</b> Turkey claims that Imia/Kardak does not fit into the definition stipulated by the Article 14 of the treaty.|$|E
25|$|The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association {{argued that}} the court should look beyond mere {{dictionary}} definitions of “sewer” to examine the legal <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> {{in the specific context}} of how that term is used in Proposition 218. The Association also observed that numerous California statutes differentiated between storm drainage and sewerage systems, including a specific statute that legally authorizes many local governments to levy fees and charges for storm drainage or sewerage systems.|$|E

25|$|The <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> {{feral cat}} varies between professions and countries, and is {{sometimes}} used interchangeably with other {{terms such as}} free-roaming, street, alley, or community cat. Some of these terms are also {{used to refer to}} stray cats, although stray and feral cats are generally considered to be different by rescuers, veterinarians, and researchers. Stray cats are socialized cats who no longer live in homes, but could potentially be successfully reintroduced to a home environment.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein also ponders the {{possibility}} of a language that talks about those things that are known only to the user, whose content is inherently private. The usual example is that of a language in which one names one's sensations and other subjective experiences, such that the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> is decided by the individual alone. For example, the individual names a particular sensation, on some occasion, 'S', and intends to use that word to refer to that sensation. Such a language Wittgenstein calls a private language.|$|E
25|$|The seven-member {{committee}} {{drafted a}} definition which preserved Pluto’s status by only requiring a planet to be (1) {{large enough to}} assume hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly round shape) and (2) orbiting a star without itself being a star. This proposal was criticized by many for weakening the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term.</b> The eventual definition adopted by the IAU added an additional requirement, that a body must have cleared its neighborhood of all other sizable objects, language that Gingerich was “not at all pleased” with.|$|E

25|$|The {{terms are}} found in synagogue {{inscriptions}} in Aphrodisias. Judging from the distinctions in the Book of Acts {{it is thought that}} they did not become ger tzedeks, which required circumcision, although the evidence across the centuries varies widely and the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> may have included all kinds of sympathetic Gentiles, proselytes or not. There are also around 300 text references (4th century BCE to 3rd century CE) to a sect of Hypsistarians, some of whom practiced Sabbath and which many scholars see as sympathizers with Judaism related to God fearers.|$|E
25|$|The Siachen Glacier, {{though a}} part of the Kashmir region, was not officially demarcated on maps {{prepared}} and exchanged between the two sides in 1947. As a consequence, prior to the 1980s, neither India nor Pakistan maintained any permanent military presence in the region. However, Pakistan began conducting and allowing a series of mountaineering expeditions to the glacier beginning in the 1950s. By the early 1980s, the Government of Pakistan was granting special expedition permits to mountaineers and United States Army maps deliberately showed Siachen as {{a part of}} Pakistan. This practice gave rise to the contemporary <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> oropolitics.|$|E
25|$|The <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> {{geometry}} in {{the context}} of Minkowski space depends heavily on what is meant by the term. Minkowski space is not endowed with a Euclidean geometry, and not with any of the generalized Riemannian geometries with intrinsic curvature, those exposed by the model spaces in hyperbolic geometry (negative curvature) and the geometry modeled by the sphere (positive curvature). The reason is the indefiniteness of the Minkowski metric. Minkowski space is, in particular, not a metric space and not a Riemannian manifold with a Riemannian metric. However, Minkowski space contains submanifolds endowed with a Riemannian metric yielding hyperbolic geometry.|$|E
