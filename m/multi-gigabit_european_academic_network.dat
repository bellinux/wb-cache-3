40|$|The energy {{consumption}} of backbone networks has risen exponentially {{during the past}} decade with the advent of various bandwidth-hungry applications. To address this serious issue, network operators are keen to identify new energy-saving techniques to green their networks. Up to this point, the optimization of IGP link weights has only been used for load-balancing operations in IP-based networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel link weight setting algorithm, the Green Load-balancing Algorithm (GLA), which is able to jointly optimize both energy efficiency and load-balancing in backbone networks without any modification to the underlying network protocols. The distinct advantage of GLA is that it can be directly applied on top of existing link-sleeping based Energy-aware Traffic Engineering (ETE) schemes in order to achieve substantially improved energy saving gains, {{while at the same time}} maintain traditional traffic engineering objectives. In order to evaluate the performance of GLA without losing generality, we applied the scheme to a number of recently proposed but diverse ETE schemes based on link sleeping operations. Evaluation results based on the <b>European</b> <b>academic</b> <b>network</b> topology GÉANT and its real traffic matrices show that GLA is able to achieve significantly improved energy efficiency compared to the original standalone algorithms, while also achieving near-optimal load-balancing performance. In addition, we further consider end-to-end traffic delay requirements since the optimization of link weights for load-balancing and energy savings may introduce substantially increased traffic delay after link sleeping. In order to solve this issue, we modified the existing ETE schemes to improve their end-to-end traffic delay performance. The evaluation of the modified ETE schemes together with GLA shows that it is still possible to save a significant amount of energy while achieving substantial load-balancing within a given traffic delay constraint. © 2014 Elsevier B.

50|$|During the 1990s, the {{so-called}} national networks for science, {{research and education}} were established {{in the majority of}} European countries, the aim of which was to serve the specific needs of scientific and academic communities. The beginning of <b>academic</b> <b>networks</b> in the Czech Republic dates back to 1991, when a mainframe computer was installed in the computing centre of the Czech Technical University, which was then connected to the EARN (<b>European</b> <b>Academic</b> Research <b>Network)</b> <b>academic</b> <b>network.</b> The transfer speed was 9.6 kbit/s, {{and it was the first}} opportunity to access the global network infrastructure from the country. In 1992, the transfer speed doubled and was divided into two independent channels. One channel continued to be used for the EARN network, and the other one was used for the Internet. The Czech Republic was officially connected to the Internet on 13 February 1992. The academic community showed a huge interest in being connected to the network. Representatives of universities and institutes of the Academy of Sciences met to discuss the technical solutions for the network that would be used to connect their institutions. The result was a project called FESNET (Federal Education and Scientific NETwork), which was supported by the Department of Education. After the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the CESNET project was modified, and the CESNET network was put into operation at the beginning of 1993. From 1992 to 1999 CESNET supported a commercial network, but this activity was sold in early 1999 and from that time CESNET was fully focused on academic networking.|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the major expense of {{improving}} the Eastern European telecommunications infrastructure - - {{hundreds of billions of}} dollars over at least a decade - - <b>academic</b> <b>networks</b> provide an interim capability for researchers that is quite promising. Since Western European nations have been successfully using these robust, low unit cost networks for over a decade, the major development and implementation expense can be considered amortized, allowing new network users the combined advantage of rapid connection and outstanding support service from the vast network of competent, experienced users. The perspective offered is one of examining the unit cost of such network services, rather than the more amorphous value structures frequently used in assessing progress of a new technology in a developing country. With the unit cost criterion as a basis, the use of existing <b>academic</b> <b>networks,</b> especially the <b>European</b> <b>Academic</b> Research <b>Network</b> (EARN), is shown to be in the range of one tenth to one hundredth the cost per transmission of fax, telephone or cable and far below the cost per message of the mail system. Transmissions arrive at their destinations in minutes or less. The favorable cost of these communications systems can be given greater leverage by the providing of value added services that provide users with a broad range of help, particularly in the context of training and integration with the hundreds of other networks beyond EARN, making it possible to link to hundreds of thousands of researchers in over sixty countries of the world for a few cents per transmission. To operationalize the perspective offered, actual data from Czechoslovakia are included showing exponential rises in both the user population and the volume of message traffic in and outside the country. Finally, a test case is suggested, that of Romania, a country that has not entered the international network process yet, but which could quickly achieve the described benefits after a short period of using value added services...|$|R
