40|$|Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, or histiocytic necrotising {{lymphadenopathy}} {{of unknown}} aetiology, is a rare, benign and self-limiting cause of lymphadenopathy often involving the cervical nodes, and rarely presenting with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. We present a 26 -year-old Caucasian male, who presented with right iliac fossa pain and low grade pyrexia, mimicking acute appendicitis. He underwent a laparatomy and an extended right hemi-colectomy for a caecal mass.

40|$|Backgrounds/Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{abdominal}} sonographic features of patients with <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymphadenitis</b> versus sonographic features of the asymptomatic children, in order to identify diagnost ic criteria for <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymphadenitis.</b> Patients and Methods: Ultrasound data from 113 children with acute abdominal pain whose suspected sonographic diagnosis was mesenteric adenitis or ileitis was inspected in a child hospital in March 2004 to March 2005. The fina l diagnoses were established after patient management and follow-up. As for the control group, a hundred asymptomatic children were referred from health centers or kindergartens. Results: No para-aortic lymphadenopathy was found in any of the subjects from the study and the control groups. The number of enlarge d mesenteric lymph nodes observed in symptomatic children was significantly greater than the figure in asymptomatic children (P 0. 0001). The highest rate of sensitivity was seen with the presence of RLQ lymphadenopathy (94. 7 %) and the highest rate of specifici ty was seen with the presence of lymphadenopathy in two or three areas of LUQ or mi d-abdomen together; lymphadenopathies larger than 6 mm in RLQ; presence of more than 4 lymph nodes (with any size) in a sonographic image from RLQ; or thickening of terminal il eum more than 8 mm (92 %- 100 %) in the diagnosis of <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymphadenitis.</b> Conclusion: In children with acute abdominal pain due to causes such as appendicitis which cannot be confirmed by ultrasound and the f indings consist of only enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (&# 8805; 4 mm) and/or mural thickening of the terminal ileum (&# 8805; 8 mm), the probable diagnosis would be mesenteric adenitis-ileitis and surgery is not required; but close observation is recommended...|$|E
40|$|A {{serotype}} 4 {{a strain}} of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis lacking the virulence plasmid pYV (pYV- strain) was isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes but not from the stool or the appendix of a 10 -year-old girl with a diagnosis of acute <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymphadenitis.</b> Microscopically, reticulocytic abscess and lymphadenitis were persent in the enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Antibody against the isolate was detected in the serum. The isolate was negative {{for the presence of}} plasmid pYV and plasmid pYV-mediated properties, including autoagglutination and calcium dependency, but was positive for chromosome-mediated properties, including invasion into HeLa cells and tissues of mice and the Serény test. Mice were orally infected with this pYV- strain, and rapid elimination from the intestine occurred 14 days later. Hence, the potential to inhibit the phagocytosis encoded by plasmid pYV was lacking. As the pYV- strain was recovered from the mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen, the invasiveness was encoded by chromosomal genes. The count of the pYV- strain in the mesenteric lymph nodes increased to 10 (4. 6) cells per g within 4 days. These findings suggest that pYV- Y. pseudotuberculosis was the causative agent of acute <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymphadenitis</b> in the absence of gastroenteritis...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{possibilities}} of ultrasonography {{in the diagnosis}} of intussusception in children and disinvagination by hydroechocolonoscopy have been studied. The {{study was conducted in}} 2014 – 2015 at the Children’s Regional hospital of Tver. The age of children varied from 3 months up to 12 years. The disease duration before admission was 3 – 63 hours. The X-ray study confirmed the intussusception in all patients. In all cases, <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymphadenitis</b> was revealed. Of 28 children, disinvagination was sucsessfuly performed with an aid of hydroechocolonoscopy in 26 (92. 8 %) patients. In 2 cases (7. 2 %), we failed to eliminate intussusception and children underwent the surgery. Three patients had recurrence; re-elimination of intussusception with hydroechocolonoscopy was performed. No complications were observed after disinvagination. Conclusion: The use of ultrasound in the diagnosis and treatment of intussusception eliminates radiation exposure, and allows the cause of intussusceptions to be determined as well. Disinvagination with hydroechocolonoscopy is technically simple, highly effective and safe.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Transmissible ileal {{hyperplasia}} (TIH) was experimentally induced in weanling hamsters, and {{the development}} of lesions was characterized. Ileal lesions developed in two phases: a hyperplastic phase which was detected by Day 10 and an inflammatory phase which began by Day 20. Hyperplasia began as focal lengthening of villi with expansion of crypt-type epithelium onto villus walls. Diffuse hyperplasia of distal ileum developed; dilated, tortuous crypts penetrated subjacent supporting tissues; but metastases were not seen. Inflammation began in association with focal or segmental necrosis of crypt epithelium, and crypt abscesses developed. Severe pyogranulomatous inflammation of the ileal wall, focal peritonitis, <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymphadenitis,</b> and portal hepatitis were common in advanced lesions. Development of ileal lesions was closely correlated with accumulation of particulate antigen, detectable by immunofluorescence, in the cytoplasm of mucosal epithelial cells.

40|$|Plasmid-free {{strains of}} Yersinia pseudotuberculosis induce {{aggregation}} of human platelets in vitro. It appears that {{this phenomenon is}} mediated by invasin (Inv), a 103 -kDa outer membrane protein that permits bacteria to penetrate mammalian cells, since (i) an isogenic inv-deficient mutant failed to aggregate platelets compared with the parental strain; (ii) a monoclonal antibody directed against invasin inhibited platelet aggregation; (iii) Inv ' Escherichia coli HB 101 promoted platelet aggregation. Platelet receptors for invasin were identified by using a panel of anti-platelet glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies in a bacterial adhesion assay. We found that bacteria bind to platelet membrane glycoproteins Ic and Ila. Electron microscopic study of bacterium-platelet interactions also revealed that bacteria expressing invasin attach to and are phagocytized by thrombocytes, in contrast to inv-deficient bacteria, indicating that these anucleated cells are able to internalize bacteria in vitro after specific interaction with invasin.

Epidemiologically, whereas episodic acquisition of atypical strains by hospitalized patients is indicative of nosocomial transmission, in the present series sporadic isolations over a 4 -year period, mainly from ambulatory patients, suggest an occult reservoir in the community serviced by The Mount Sinai Hospital.
