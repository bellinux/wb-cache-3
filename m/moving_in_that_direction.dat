500|$|Toward {{the last}} years of his reign Władysław IV sought to enhance his {{position}} and assure his son's succession by waging a war on the Ottoman Empire, for which he prepared, despite the lack of nobility support. To secure this end the King worked on forming an alliance with the Cossacks, whom he encouraged to improve their military readiness and intended to use against the Turks, <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>direction</b> of cooperation further than his predecessors. The war never took place, and the King had to explain his offensive war designs during the [...] "inquisition" [...] sejm of 1646.

2500|$|The {{reason why}} the object does not fall down when {{subjected}} to only downward forces is a simple one. [...] Think about what keeps an object up after it is thrown. [...] Once an object is thrown into the air, there is only the downward force of earth’s gravity that acts on the object. [...] That {{does not mean that}} once an object is thrown in the air, it will fall instantly. [...] What keeps that object up in the air is its velocity. [...] The first of Newton's laws of motion states that an object’s inertia keeps it in motion, and since the object in the air has a velocity, it will tend to keep <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In mammals, {{inhalation}} at rest {{is primarily}} due to the contraction of the diaphragm. This is an upwardly domed sheet of muscle that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. When it contracts the sheet flattens, (i.e. moves downwards as shown in Fig.7) increasing {{the volume of the}} thoracic cavity. The contracting diaphragm [...] pushes the abdominal organs downwards. But because the pelvic floor prevents the lowermost abdominal organs <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>direction,</b> the pliable abdominal contents cause the belly to bulge outwards to the front and sides, because the relaxed abdominal muscles do not resist this movement (Fig.7). This entirely passive bulging (and shrinking during exhalation) of the abdomen during normal breathing is sometimes referred as [...] "abdominal breathing", although it is, in fact, [...] "diaphragmatic breathing", which is not visible {{on the outside of the}} body. Mammals only use their abdominal muscles only during forceful exhalation (see Fig.8, and discussion below). Never during any form of inhalation.|$|E

60|$|We {{were glad}} to find at Noacolly that our {{observations}} on the progression westwards of the Burrampooter (see chapter xxvii) were confirmed {{by the fact that}} the Megna also is gradually <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>direction,</b> leaving much dry land on the Noacolly side, and forming islands opposite that coast; whilst it encroaches on the Sunderbunds, and is cutting away the islands in that direction. This advance of the fresh waters amongst the Sunderbunds is destructive to the vegetation of the latter, which requires salt; and if the Megna continues its slow course westwards, the obliteration of thousands of square miles of a very peculiar flora, and the extinction of many species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else, may ensue. In ordinary cases these plants, etc., would take up their abode on the east coast, as they were driven from the west; but such might not be the case in this delta; for the sweeping tides of the east coast prevent any such vegetation establishing itself there, and the mud which the eastern rivers carry down, becomes a caking dry soil, unsuited to the germination of seeds.|$|E

Two hundred Boers had also been reported <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>direction.</b> Presently came the sound of distant musketry--not so very distant either. Everyone pricked up his ears. Two miles away to the left was a green hill broken by rocky kopjes. Looking through my glasses I could see ten or twelve riderless horses grazing.

Suddenly one galloped away madly, and even at the distance it was possible to see the cloud of dust from pursuing bullets. A straggling column of Boers was trekking away across the plain back to their main position. Then came reports and rumours. 'Ambuscaded the Dutchmen--shot 'em to bits--some of them cut off--come and bag the lot.' Behind the rumours Barnes, adjutant of the Imperial Light Horse, joyful, with a breathless horse; he explained how they had seen two hundred Boers moving towards distant hills, to make sure of their line of retreat by the Acton Homes road into the Free State; galloped to cut them off; reached the hills first, with just five minutes to spare; dismounted, commanding the road, and waited.|$|E
