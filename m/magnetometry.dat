5|$|The first {{investigation}} of the chapel ruins, supported by the National Trust, was conducted by the local history group {{in the winter of}} 1998–99. This survey was conducted under a licence from English Heritage that allowed access but did not permit excavation, so it relied on height measurements, geophysics (resistivity, and <b>magnetometry)</b> and molehill sampling. The area surveyed was 100m long and 40m wide (109yd by 44yd). The <b>magnetometry</b> failed to detect the subterranean features of the chapel, but did show an unexpected linear anomaly, related to buried ironwork from wartime defences. The resistivity survey clearly showed the larger room, but barely detected the smaller, suggesting that it had less substantial foundations, was probably less well-constructed, and possibly later in date.|$|E
5|$|With {{sites such}} as Danebury {{where there is no}} modern {{habitation}} or built environment, extensive excavations can be undertaken to establish the general layout. The modern settlement of Mellor extends over the Iron Age hill fort, which restricts archaeological investigation. A geophysical survey was performed to establish the extent of the settlement; methods such as <b>magnetometry</b> and ground-penetrating radar were successful in identifying the eastern and northern sections of the ditch encircling the site. Excavations have been concentrated around the Old Vicarage. By 2004 there were 43trenches, 14trial trenches, and 17test pits. The investigation of the site has revealed two ditches. While the external ditch encloses a larger area, it has smaller dimensions than the internal ditch.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a {{realignment}} of the Glaven channel {{meant that}} the Eye would be left unprotected {{to the north of}} the river, and would eventually be destroyed by coastal change. It was decided that the only practical course of action was to investigate the site while it still existed, and a preliminary evaluation was carried out in 2003 as preparation for a full survey in 2004–05. The surveyed area covered 10ha (25acre), significantly more than the 0.4ha (1acre) of the 1998 investigations. 50 trenches were excavated in a herringbone pattern outside the buildings, each 50m long and 1.80m wide (194 by 5.9ft), and six trenches of varying dimensions were created inside the chapel. The latter equated in total area to two of the standard trenches. The geology was investigated with eight boreholes, and geophysics (<b>magnetometry</b> and metal detection) were used to locate subsurface anomalies.|$|E
25|$|A {{geophysical}} {{survey was conducted}} {{in the interior of}} Buckland Rings in 1993 using <b>magnetometry.</b> However, geological conditions at the site for magnetic detection of archaeology were discovered to be poor and features such as posthole structures were undetectable. The survey was able to trace the course of the missing defences, locate the position of Hawkes's excavations, and partially define the entrance features. Evidence of settlement activity, however, was inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|Broadly {{there have}} been three {{distinct}} levels of archaeological research into the site. The first of these is evaluation excavations conducted by Philip Rahtz (1956), Trent & Peak Archaeology (1991) and archaeological television programme Time Team (2011). The second of these were geophysical surveys, which took place under Masters (2004) and Gaunt (2010). Masters surveyed limited sections of the site using both <b>magnetometry</b> and resistivity; Gaunt surveyed the entirety of Castlefield using resistivity.|$|E
25|$|A <b>magnetometry</b> {{survey of}} the {{interior}} of the hillfort in 2010 revealed over 400 circular anomalies of uncertain purpose (maculae) distributed across the fort, although there were fewer around the south-east. Their size and number, as well as finds from similar features in previous excavations, suggests they may have been storage pits. The survey also discovered curved features that probably indicate the presence of roundhouses. They were grouped close to the ramparts on the north, west, and south sides. There are signs of post-medieval quarrying outside the main entrance to the fort. Outside the hillfort were more curved anomalies, suggesting roundhouses in a settlement beyond the ramparts. It was surrounded by a ditch.|$|E
500|$|There is {{only limited}} {{evidence}} for use after the 17th-century desertion, including a 19th-century tobacco pipe and some Victorian glassware. [...] A wartime barbed wire fence {{ran through the}} ruins, and was detected by excavation and <b>magnetometry.</b> Other modern finds included a gin trap, bullets and other small metal objects.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>magnetometry</b> {{survey in}} 1997 {{revealed}} two entrances (at {{the southeast and}} southwest) and found {{evidence to suggest that}} the site had a thriving Iron Age settlement. Bronze Age and Roman pottery has also been found at the site.|$|E
2500|$|Remote sensing or Marine Geophysics is {{generally}} carried out using equipment towed from a vessel {{on the surface}} and therefore does not require any one, or any equipment to actually penetrate to the full depth of the site. [...] Sensitive sonar, especially side-scan sonar or multi-beam sonar may be used to image an underwater site. [...] <b>Magnetometry</b> can be used to locate metal remains such as metal shipwrecks, anchors and cannon. [...] Sub-bottom profiling utilizes sonar to detect structures buried beneath sediment.|$|E
2500|$|Resistivity and <b>magnetometry</b> surveys {{undertaken}} {{during the}} 1980s revealed four magnetic anomalies within {{the centre of}} the circle, possibly representing [...] "pits related in some way to local ground surface undulations and the presence of localised burning." [...] Lambrick noted that similar features could be found within the stone circles of Mayburgh, Stenness and Balbirnie, suggesting that it was a possible original prehistoric feature, although accepted that it could equally be the result of refuse deposited in the Romano-British period or tree-planting holes. Meanwhile, archaeological excavation also revealed that there was [...] "no indication" [...] of there being [...] "a substantial ditch" [...] either inside or outside the bank on which the stones were positioned.|$|E
2500|$|John Michell ( [...] ; 25 December 1724 – 29 April 1793) was an English clergyman {{and natural}} philosopher who {{provided}} pioneering insights {{in a wide}} range of scientific fields, including astronomy, geology, optics, and gravitation. Considered [...] "one of the greatest unsung scientists of all time", he was the first person known to propose the existence of black holes in publication, the first to suggest that earthquakes travel in waves, the first to explain how to manufacture artificial magnets, and the first to apply statistics to the study of the cosmos, recognizing that double stars were a product of mutual gravitation. He also invented an apparatus to measure the mass of the Earth. [...] He has been called both the father of seismology and the father of <b>magnetometry.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Further {{excavations}} were {{undertaken in}} 1967 when an area [...] was excavated within {{the northern part}} of the hillfort with the intention of investigating pit-like features identified in the 1960 <b>magnetometry</b> survey. Finds from the twelve pits consisted of Iron Age and Roman pottery, animal bones, and charcoal. The layer of topsoil above the pits produced Roman pottery and some Roman coins from the 3rd and 4thcenturies. The 1960 survey again guided the excavations of 1970 and 1971 when several trenches totalling an area of [...] were dug in the interior near the rampart on the north side of the site. A trench was dug across the rampart to provide a cross-section. Despite multiple excavations, the results have generally been poorly published and as a result the hillfort remains little understood.|$|E
50|$|Faraday force <b>magnetometry</b> {{uses the}} fact that a spatial {{magnetic}} field gradient produces force that acts on a magnetized object, F=(M⋅∇)B. In Faraday Force <b>Magnetometry</b> the force on the sample can be measured by a scale (hanging the sample from a sensitive balance), or by detecting the displacement against a spring. Commonly a capacitive load cell or cantilever is used because of its sensitivity, size, and lack of mechanical parts. Faraday Force <b>Magnetometry</b> is approximately one order of magnitude less sensitive than a SQUID. The biggest drawback to Faraday Force <b>Magnetometry</b> is that it requires some means of not only producing a magnetic field, but also producing a magnetic field gradient. While this can be accomplished by using a set of special pole faces, a much better result can be achieved by using set of gradient coils. A major advantage to Faraday Force <b>Magnetometry</b> is that it is small and reasonably tolerant to noise, and thus can be implemented {{in a wide range of}} environments, including a dilution refrigerator. Faraday Force <b>Magnetometry</b> can also be complicated by the presence of torque (see previous technique). This can be circumvented by varying the gradient field independently of the applied DC field so the torque and the Faraday Force contribution can be separated, and/or by designing a Faraday Force Magnetometer that prevents the sample from being rotated.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic torque <b>magnetometry</b> can be {{even more}} {{sensitive}} than SQUID <b>magnetometry.</b> However, magnetic torque <b>magnetometry</b> doesn’t measure magnetism directly as all the previously mentioned methods do. Magnetic torque <b>magnetometry</b> instead measures the torque τ acting on a sample’s magnetic moment μ {{as a result of}} a uniform magnetic field B, τ=μ×B.A torque is thus a measure of the sample's magnetic or shape anisotropy. In some cases the sample's magnetization can be extracted from the measured torque. In other cases, the magnetic torque measurement is used to detect magnetic phase transitions or quantum oscillations. The most common way to measure magnetic torque is to mount the sample on a cantilever and measure the displacement via capacitance measurement between the cantilever and nearby fixed object, or by measuring the piezoelectricity of the cantilever, or by optical interferometry off the surface of the cantilever.|$|E

50|$|SQUIDs are {{a type of}} {{magnetometer}} {{used both}} as survey and as laboratory magnetometers. SQUID <b>magnetometry</b> is an extremely sensitive absolute <b>magnetometry</b> technique. However SQUIDs are noise sensitive, making them impractical as laboratory magnetometers in high DC magnetic fields, and in pulsed magnets. Commercial SQUID magnetometers are available for temperatures between 300 mK and 400 kelvins, and magnetic fields up to 7 tesla.|$|E
50|$|Optical <b>magnetometry</b> {{makes use}} of various optical {{techniques}} to measure magnetization. One such technique, Kerr <b>Magnetometry</b> {{makes use of}} the magneto-optic Kerr effect, or MOKE. In this technique, incident light is directed at the sample’s surface. Light interacts with a magnetized surface nonlinearly so the reflected light has an elliptical polarization, which is then measured by a detector. Another method of optical <b>magnetometry</b> is Faraday Rotation <b>Magnetometry.</b> Faraday Rotation <b>Magnetometry</b> utilizes nonlinear magneto-optical rotation to measure a sample’s magnetization. In this method a Faraday Modulating thin film {{is applied to the}} sample to be measured and a series of images are taken with a camera that senses the polarization of the reflected light. To reduce noise, multiple pictures are then averaged together. One advantage to this method is that it allows mapping of the magnetic characteristics over the surface of a sample. This can be especially useful when studying such things as the Meissner Effect on superconductors. Microfabricated optically pumped magnetometers (µOPMs) can be used to detect the origin of brain seizures more precisely and generate less heat than currently available superconducting quantum interference devices, better known as SQUIDs. The device works by using polarized light to control the spin of rubidium atoms which can be used to measure and monitor the magnetic field.|$|E

50|$|Roy {{graduated}} from Seton Hall College in 1937 with a Physics degree. He was trained in <b>Magnetometry</b> by the Carnegie Institution. He served as Geophysicist and Magnetologist on the MacGregor Arctic Expedition July 1, 1937 through October 4, 1938. He {{was a member}} of the United States Antarctic Service Expedition (Byrd's third expedition) 1939 through 1941 where he worked at West Base on <b>magnetometry,</b> aurora studies and seismology in the Rockefeller Mountains where a peak bears his name.|$|E
50|$|Pulsed Field Extraction <b>Magnetometry</b> {{is another}} method {{making use of}} pickup coils to measure magnetization. Unlike VSMs where the sample is {{physically}} vibrated, in Pulsed Field Extraction <b>Magnetometry,</b> the sample is secured and the external magnetic field is changed rapidly, for example in a capacitor-driven magnet. One of multiple techniques must then be used to cancel out the external field from the field produced by the sample. These include counterwound coils that cancel the external uniform field, and background measurements with the sample removed from the coil.|$|E
