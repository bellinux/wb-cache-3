An {{overload}} limiter is used {{to prevent}} its overturning accident during an operating of a <b>movable</b> <b>crane.</b> Recently the indirectly measuring method, which measures hoisting load and overturning moment of overload limiter, demands instead of the existing method, which measures only hoisting load. The indirectly measuring method is how to conduct the hoisting load and overturning moment as measuring the load of hydraulic cylinder for a luffing driving of boom. So {{we need to develop}} the many-angular pin type load cell with the measuring angle of ± 10 degree instead of the existing load cell with the measuring angle of ± 2 degree. In this study we conducted the finite element analysis in order to evaluate the effect of the aspect ratio of measuring cross section on the measuring limit of the load cell to develop the many-angular pin type load cell. For this investigation, the aspect ratio of measuring cross section and load applying angle were adopted as design parameters and the stresses of measuring part were evaluated for each parameter...|$|E
40|$|Ventspil Free Port Authority has {{commissioned}} {{the design of}} a new berth capable of hosting post Panamax vessels and having a retaining height of 18. 5 m. In proximity of the quay wall two sewage pipes lay {{on the bottom of the}} Venta River’s bed, which need to be combined into one single conduit with a diameter of 900 mm. In proximity of the quay wall the already existing movable Bridge on the River Venta is positioned perpendicularly to the quay wall’s center line. The final project is composed mostly of three parts: the design of the berth and of the pipeline, the analysis of the interaction between the quay wall and the conduit, the analysis of the interaction between the quay wall and the bridge’s foundation. Chapters 2, reports all boundary conditions such as water and ground levels, design vessels, hydraulic and morphological conditions, topographic and meteorological boundaries. Chapter 3 deals with the soil interpretation procedure, showing different available methods and adopted ones. The soil parameters such as angle of internal friction, dry and saturated weight and soil stiffness are obtained. Chapter 4 and 5, present different types of quay walls such as gravity walls, piles quay walls and open berth structures. By performing a Multi Criteria Analysis a choice of the most suitable berth is obtained. Chapter 6 - 8, deal with the load analysis of the quay wall. In particular chapter 6 deals with the estimation of the quay wall’s foundation reaction forces due to loads such as the concrete weight, soil weight, traffic and cargo yard load, crane, fender and ice load. Chapter 7 analyzes in particular the spreading pattern of the <b>movable</b> <b>crane</b> load on the quay wall. Chapter 8 considers the load combination on the quay wall. The design of the foundation elements of the quay wall such as the steel Combi-wall and the concrete bearing piles is performed according to different methods in chapter 9 and 10. The most suitable and most conservative one is found to be the Koppejan method. Negative skin friction effects are also included in the design of the bearing piles. The design of the Combi-wall is determined by adopting Blum’s method of fixed point. Chapter 11 deals with the design of the anchor wall and of the anchor rods. Chapter 12 estimates the construction costs of the quay wall, which amount to ca. 30. 000 Euros per running meter. The overall stability of the quay wall is determined by adopting a 2 D Plaxis model of the berth as reported in Chapter 13. Chapter 14 deals with the design of the pipeline and interaction between the quay wall’s foundation elements and the pipe. By means of a 2 D Plaxis analysis, the soil stress increment on the pile is determined. The effects of the quay wall’s deformations on the pipe are found to generate an increase of soil stresses around the pipe’s shell of ca. 25 KPa. Least but not last the interaction between the quay wall and the Bridge’s foundation is determined. The Bridge’s foundation is in fact influenced by the deformation of the quay wall and by the dredging of the pocket in front of the quay wall. Analysis is performed by using Plaxis 3 D. Results show negligible or small effects on the Bridge’s foundation in the order of 1 cm displacement of the Bridge’s foundation. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
50|$|Elbląg {{is not a}} deep-water port. The {{draft of}} vessels using its {{waterways}} must be no greater than 1.5 m by law. The turning area at Elbląg is 120 m diameter and a pilot is required for large vessels. Deep water vessels cannot manoeuvre; in that sense, Elbląg has become a subsidiary port of Gdańsk. Traffic of smaller vessels at Elbląg is within the river and very marginal, while larger vessels cannot reach the open Baltic Sea because the channel, once built in East-Prussia {{to go through the}} peninsula, has belonged to Russia since 1945. The city features three quay complexes, <b>movable</b> <b>cranes,</b> and railways.|$|R

50|$|The south quay of {{the dock}} was entirely {{equipped}} for coal export, with seven coal hoists, with capacity of 400 tons per hour. Extensive sidings were built mainly to the south {{of the dock}}, with inbound storage available for 8,000 (loaded) coal wagons, and outbound storage for 3500 wagons. The northwestern arm was initially built as a timber pond, with adjacent rail sidings. Coal hoists were hydraulically powered, supplied by gravity sidings carried across sidings by ferro-concrete bridges built by the Yorkshire Hennebique Contracting Company (Leeds). Six of the hoists were supplied by W.G. Armstrong Whitworth and Company; the seventh, a movable hoist was supplied by Tannet, Walker and Company (Leeds). The north quay of the southwestern arm was used for pig iron handling, and was equipped with ten <b>movable</b> <b>cranes</b> from Armstrong Whitworth of lifting capacity of 5 or 3 tons, and a fixed crane with lifting capacity of up to 50 tons. Further cranes from Cowans, Sheldon and Company (Carlisle) were supplied for the transit sheds.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the early}} {{concerns}} of the growing station was that the Army would make claims on its property. Because of their facilities, as wharves, cranes, artesian wells, and coal supplies, many requests {{were made by the}} Army for their use. By February 1901, the Army had made application for the privilege of establishing on Navy docks <b>movable</b> <b>cranes</b> for handling coal and other stores, a saluting battery and a flag staff on the naval reservation, and an artesian well of its own. All these requests were rejected by the Bureau of Equipment on the theory that, once granted, they [...] "will practically constitute a permanent foothold on the property, and end in dividing it between the two Departments, or in the entire exclusion of the Navy Department on the ground of military expediency as established by frequency of use." [...] However, the Army Depot Quartermaster at Honolulu contracted for the sinking of an artesian well on the Naval Station with the Commandant's approval, who, in turn, acted on a recommendation of the Bureau of Yards and Docks. The flow of water obtained amounted to over 1.5 million gallons per day, sufficient for all purposes of the Army and Navy. The Bureau of Equipment felt that its word of caution was justified when the Depot Quartermaster in 1902 {{let it be known that}} any water used by the Navy from the artesian well was [...] "only given by courtesy of the Army".|$|R
5000|$|In the 1950s, the Maritime Administration instituted the Liberty Ship Conversion and Engine Improvement Program, {{which had}} a goal to {{increase}} the speed of Liberty ships to , making them competitive with more modern designs, as well as gaining experience with alternate propulsion systems. Four ships were converted in the $11 million program. [...] The SS Benjamin Chew had its existing condensers modified and a new superheater and geared turbine installed to give the ship 6,000 shp, up from 2,500. The SS Thomas Nelson had its bow lengthened, diesel engines installed in place of the original steam engine, and <b>movable</b> <b>cranes</b> outfitted in place of the original cargo handling gear. The GTS (Gas Turbine Ship) John Sergeant had its bow extended, and its steam engine replaced with a General Electric gas turbine of 6,600 shp, connected to a reversible pitch propeller via reduction gearing. John Sergeant was considered overall to be a success, but problems with the reversible pitch propeller ended its trial after 3 years. The GTS William Patterson had its bow extended and its steam engine replaced with 6 General Electric GE-14 free-piston gas generators, connected to two reversible turbines and capable of 6,000 shp total. William Patterson was considered to be a failure as reliability was poor and the scalability of the design was poor. [...] All four vessels were fueled with Bunker C fuel oil, though John Sergeant required a quality of fuel available at limited ports and also required further treatment to reduce contaminants. [...] Three were scrapped in 1971 or 1972 and the diesel-equipped Thomas Nelson was scrapped in 1981.|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the dynamic {{behavior of a}} container crane under seismic loads accurately, the contact state between the wheels and the rails or the ground that significantly affect the seismic response of the structure must be considered elaborately. This paper proposes a modeling method based on the theory of contact and friction for simulating the nonlinear seismic response of large and flexible structure for a jumbo <b>movable</b> container <b>crane,</b> including the contact problem regarding the wheels attached {{to the bottom of}} its legs and the rails on which they ride. These models are used to perform extensive dynamic time-history analysis in order to find out their nonlinear dynamic behavior under various excitation modes. It is found that the presented numerical modeling method simulates the nonlinear seismic response of a container crane quite well. Notably, it can verify and expand our understanding of the seismic behaviors by evaluating response performance for other large seaport cranes...|$|R
