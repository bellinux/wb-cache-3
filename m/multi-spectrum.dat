40|$|The {{major sources}} of {{fluorine}} in the stratosphere are CFC- 11 and CFC- 12. Photolysis of these compounds leads to release of chlorine atoms, while the fluorine is, in a first step, present {{in the form of}} carbonyl compounds like COClF and COF 2. Their further photolysis liberates fluorine atoms, which are quickly converted to HF. Given its long life time, COF 2 is the second stratospheric fluorine reservoir. The first COF 2 vertical distributions were derived from occultation measurements performed by the ATMOS instrument during the SPACELAB- 3 Space Shuttle mission in 1985. The Canadian FTIR spectrometer ACE-FTS, onboard the SCISAT- 1 satellite, is the first instrument since the last ATMOS flight in 1994, to record COF 2 vertical profiles from space. All these observations show that, at mean latitudes, COF 2 concentration is maximum between 30 and 35 km. Several COF 2 IR absorption lines located either in the so-called InSb (1 - 5 µm) and MCT (2 - 16 µm) spectral ranges can be used to determine its total column from ground-based FTIR observations. In this context, several studies concerning the evolution of COF 2 total column above various stations were published during the nineties.

40|$|Mutual {{information}} (MI) {{has shown}} promise {{as an effective}} stereo matching measure for images affected by radiometric distortion. This {{is due to the}} robustness of MI against changes in illumination. However, MI-based approaches are particularly prone to the generation of false matches due to the small statistical power of the matching windows. Consequently, most previous MI approaches utilise large matching windows which smooth the estimated disparity field. This paper proposes extensions to MI-based stereo matching in order to increase the robustness of the algorithm. Firstly, prior probabilities are incorporated into the MI measure in order to considerably increase the statistical power of the matching windows. These prior probabilities, which are calculated from the global joint histogram between the stereo pair, are tuned to a two level hierarchical approach. A 2 D match surface, in which the match score is computed for every possible combination of template and matching window, is also utilised. This enforces left-right consistency and uniqueness constraints. These additions to MI-based stereo matching significantly enhance the algorithm’s ability to detect correct matches while decreasing computation time and improving the accuracy.

In the present study, the images which are 1 036 pixels in vertical direction by 1 384 pixels in horizontal direction with 24 -bit depth were captured using a red (R) waveband, near infrared (NIR) waveband and green (G) waveband multi-spectral digital imager. The three wavebands of image (red, green and NIR) can be composed into one image which contains more information than images captured by ordinary digital cameras, and the NIR image can catch more information than visible spectrum. NIR waveband images were decomposed to 16 subbands using three wavelet packet multi-resolution. Because the main feature of texture information is concentrated on the middle frequency, the 8 subbands of middle frequency were selected to calculate entropy, and the entropy of three wavebands of original image was calculated at the same time. Eighty images (twenty for each category) were used for calibration set and eighty images (twenty for each category) were used as the prediction set. Then the rice categories were classified by SVM.

40|$|The Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) {{instrument}} {{is the only}} satellite-borne sensor in operation that uses both thermal (TIR) and near-infrared (NIR) channels to estimate CO profiles. With more than 15 years (2000 to present) of validated multispectral observations, MOPITT provides the unique capability to separate CO in the lowermost troposphere (LMT, surface to 3  km (∼  700  hPa)) from the free-tropospheric abundance. To extend this record, a new, hyper-spectral approach is presented here that will provide CO data products exceeding the capabilities of MOPITT by combining the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR, equivalent to the MOPITT NIR) channels from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to be launched aboard the European Sentinel 5 Precursor (S 5 p) satellite in 2016 and the TIR channels from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite.

CO profiles are retrieved from a single-footprint, full-spectral-resolution CrIS transect over Africa on 27 – 28 August 2013 coincident with significant biomass burning. Comparisons of collocated CrIS and MOPITT CO observations for the LMT show a mean difference of 2. 8 [*]±[*] 24. 9  ppb, which is well within the estimated measurement uncertainty of both sensors. The estimated degrees of freedom (DOF) for CO signals from synergistic CrIS–TROPOMI retrievals are approximately 0. 9 in the LMT and 1. 3 above the LMT, which indicates that the LMT CO can be distinguished from the free troposphere, similar to MOPITT multispectral observations (0. 8 in the LMT, and 1. 1 above the LMT).

40|$|Image {{registration}} {{is a fundamental}} problem {{that can be found}} in a diverse range of fields within the research community. It is used in areas such as engineering, science, medicine, robotics, computer vision and image processing, which often require the process of developing a spatial mapping between sets of data. Registration plays a crucial role in the medical imaging field where continual advances in imaging modalities, including MRI, CT and PET, allow the generation of 3 D images that explicitly outline detailed in vivo information of not only human anatomy, but also human function. Mutual Information (MI) is a popular entropy-based similarity measure which has found use in a large number of image registration applications. Stemming from information theory, this measure generally outperforms most other intensity-based measures in multimodal applications as it does not assume the existence of any specific relationship between image intensities. It only assumes a statistical dependence. The basic concept behind any approach using MI is to find a transformation, which when applied to an image, will maximise the MI between two images. This thesis presents research using MI in three major topics encompassed by the computer vision and medical imaging field: rigid image registration, stereo vision, and non-rigid image registration. In the rigid domain, a novel gradient-based registration algorithm (MIGH) is proposed that uses Parzen windows to estimate image density functions and Gauss-Hermite quadrature to estimate the image entropies. The use of this quadrature technique provides an effective and efficient way of estimating entropy while bypassing the need to draw a second sample of image intensities (a procedure required in previous Parzen-based MI registration approaches). It is possible to achieve identical results with the MIGH algorithm when compared to current state of the art MI-based techniques. These results are achieved using half the previously required sample sizes, thus doubling the statistical power of the registration algorithm. Furthermore, the MIGH technique improves algorithm complexity by up to an order of N, where N represents the number of samples extracted from the images. In stereo vision, a popular passive method of depth perception, new extensions have been pro- posed in order to increase the robustness of MI-based stereo matching algorithms. Firstly, prior probabilities are incorporated into the MI measure to considerably increase the statistical power of the matching windows. The statistical power, directly related to the number of samples, can become too low when small matching windows are utilised. These priors, which are calculated from the global joint histogram, are tuned to a two level hierarchical approach. A 2 D match surface, in which the match score is computed for every possible combination of template and matching windows, is also utilised to enforce left-right consistency and uniqueness constraints. These additions to MI-based stereo matching significantly enhance the algorithms ability to detect correct matches while decreasing computation time and improving the accuracy, particularly when matching across <b>multi-spectra</b> stereo pairs. MI has also recently found use in the non-rigid domain due to a need to compute multimodal non-rigid transformations. The viscous fluid algorithm is perhaps the best method for re- covering large local mis-registrations between two images. However, this model can only be used on images from the same modality as it assumes similar intensity values between images. Consequently, a hybrid MI-Fluid algorithm is proposed to compute a multimodal non-rigid registration technique. MI is incorporated via the use of a block matching procedure to generate a sparse deformation field which drives the viscous fluid algorithm, This algorithm is also compared to two other popular local registration techniques, namely Gaussian convolution and the thin-plate spline warp, and is shown to produce comparable results. An improved block matching procedure is also proposed whereby a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) sampler is used to optimally locate grid points of interest. These grid points have a larger concentration in regions of high information and a lower concentration in regions of small information. Previous methods utilise only a uniform distribution of grid points throughout the image...|$|R
40|$|Field {{images are}} {{becoming}} more frequently used for sensing the crucial properties of the crops in Precision Agriculture. Some of them contain distortions {{that need to be}} removed before further analysis. Data from images, such as the coordinates of the crops, also need specific algorithm to be extracted. For these purposes, two computer vision algorithms were developed for pre-processing the field images from two monocular vision systems. One algorithm was used for a tower remote sensing system data pre-processing for image distortion removal and the mosaic to generate geo-referenced images. The other was for the image data interpretation used for the vision system of a field robot. Satellite and aerial remote sensing systems are the two major platforms for collecting remote sensing images for agriculture. However, due to the critical drawbacks of these systems, such as low spatial and temporal resolution, a tower remote sensing system with a 360 -degree rotatable camera on the top has been established in the experiment field to obtain the <b>multi-spectra</b> images for monitoring the status of the plants. In this research, the geo-reference and image mosaic algorithms were developed for data acquisition. While taking remote sensing images of the field, the camera will turn 360 o horizontally and 90 o vertically. This creates the difficulty of geo-reference because different images have different distortions. Therefore, traditional ways of geo-reference, such as using Ground Control Points (GCP), are no longer appropriate. A three-axis digital compass was used to provide the absolute orientation of the camera, which can be used to geo-reference a single image. The calibration of both camera and compass was introduced, and necessary parameters for geo-reference were estimated. Based on the angles, positions and optical parameters of the camera, a transformation from the image coordinate system to the ground coordinate system was introduced. After the transformation, the performance of the geo-reference method was evaluated with data from a Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) to assure the accuracy. Since there are not enough features in the field, the algorithm of the image mosaic for the tower system is based on geographical information rather than features. Moreover, comparing to aerial and satellite systems, the images from a tower remote sensing system have usually 10 to 15 times larger pitch angles that result in large geometric distortion. Thus further processing is needed to remove distortion. The algorithm firstly used coordinate transformation to compute top-view coordinates of all pixels in the image. The new coordinates were used for reorganizing the pixels. Due to the large geo-metric distortion, the Pixel Combination was applied. After computing the top-view image, global alignment was applied to generate an initial image mosaic. This global alignment method was based on the geographical information of each image, which allows a pixel-level mosaic, without limitation of detection of feature points. The mosaic image was then improved by local alignment. In local alignment, the movement of each pixel was computed by an optical flow method. For covering the entire field, seventy-one images were taken for the Energy Farm near the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The accuracy of the image mosaic was tested using several markers in the field. The other algorithm of computer vision is the image data interpretation of a vision system. A monocular vision system for a field robot was developed to replace a former binocular stereo vision system. With this system, the 3 D coordinates of plants can be geometrically estimated. Many approaches of monocular stereovision use mirrors and prisms to convert monocular images to binocular ones. However, the high frequency encoder on the robot makes it possible that without any optical accessories, one camera can still recover the 3 D coordinates of the object, due to the availability of real time velocity measurement. The camera installed on the robot functions similarly to the tower camera, which can transform the coordinates in the image frame to the ground frame. Therefore, the monocular vision system is able to estimate the relative position of a plant in front of the robot. Furthermore, with the velocity of the robot detected, the vision system can even recover the height of the plant. The robot has an encoder installed that can measure the real-time speed of the robot. With this information, the displacement between two images can be obtained, thus the height of the plant can be estimated. Therefore, with this method, the 3 -D geometric information of a plant can be obtained. Two types of experiments [...] laboratory test and field test [...] were conducted for evaluating accuracy. After the experiments, the results from both tests were compared to address the possible sources of errors. Compared to the ideal environment in a lab, the outdoor conditions could decrease the system???s performance. However, the final results show that the method has the ability to provide relatively accurate measurement...|$|R

40|$|The {{exploration}} of Venus {{in the context}} of comparative planetology and solar system research is an important key to understand crucial aspects of planetary evolution, geology, and climate. Sufficient information can only be gained by applying a long-term remote sensing observation strategy. Early missions to Venus established some basic information about atmospheric and surface features, but only since ESA’s Venus Express (VEX) mission is orbiting the planet, the first global database for systematic atmospheric and surface studies became available. It brings Venus back into the focus of {{exploration of}} the terrestrial planets after a period of more than 20 years. The Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) on Venus Express, after six years in a polar Venus orbit, provided an enormous amount of new data and a four-dimensional picture of the planet (2 D imaging + spectral dimension + temporal variations). The spectral dimension permits a sounding at different levels of the atmosphere from the ground up to the thermosphere. The planned work focuses on the investigation of temperature fields, cloud composition and altitude distribution, and trace gas concentrations in the atmosphere of Venus. Studies will be mainly performed on the nightside of the planet where the narrow atmospheric window emissions are not obscured by the more intense solar radiation reflected by the clouds. The resulting multi-dimensional maps of atmospheric state parameters will be used to calculate atmospheric net fluxes, heating and cooling rates, and the radiative energy balance of the middle and lower atmosphere of Venus, and to produce required input data for global circulation models. The quantification and elimination of atmospheric impact factors on surface emissivity retrievals are additional important components of this work. The construction of emissivity maps and specification of local emissivity variations will allow of acquire clues on different soil compositions that enable statements about the geologic development of the planet. Recently by the authors newly developed and verified radiative transfer models and special algorithms, which simultaneously use information from different atmospheric windows for each individual spectrum (multiwindow application), can be improved to a large extent by adaptation of new <b>multi-spectrum</b> retrieval techniques (<b>multi-spectrum</b> application) and by the utilization of all available a priori information on surface and atmospheric parameters. In combination with new developments for sophisticated data calibration and pre-processing of VIRTIS-M-IR data this will seriously enhance the accuracy of retrieved atmospheric and surface parameters. The paper will discuss the capability of the new <b>multi-spectrum</b> retrieval technique as well as the main scientific objectives of the planned work on global atmospheric and surface features of Venus...|$|E
