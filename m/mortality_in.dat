5|$|Coyotes rarely kill healthy adult red foxes, {{and have}} been {{observed}} to feed or den alongside them, though they often kill foxes caught in traps. Coyotes may kill fox kits, {{but this is not}} a major source of <b>mortality.</b> <b>In</b> southern California, coyotes frequently kill gray foxes, and these smaller canids tend to avoid areas with high coyote densities.|$|E
5|$|However, {{since this}} initial skepticism, {{biologists}} {{have come to}} a consensus that declines in amphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity. This consensus emerged with {{an increase in the number}} of studies that monitored amphibian populations, direct observation of mass <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> pristine sites that lacked apparent cause, and an awareness that declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature.|$|E
40|$|In situ {{controlled}} systems {{based on}} PVC cages {{surrounded by a}} net mesh and buried in sand were designed to determine the causes of important <b>mortalities</b> <b>in</b> producing locations of carpet shell clam, Ruditapes decussatus, in two important production areas of Galicia (NW Spain). The pathogenic status of the clam populations (focusing mainly on Perkinsus sp. and clam haplosporidian) as well as changes in water temperature and salinity were recorded. Sampling was conducted during {{a short period of}} time when high <b>mortalities</b> were present <b>in</b> the two locations and in a 1 -year study when no important mortalities were registered. We found that the environmental conditions and not the presence of pathogens seemed to be related to <b>mortalities</b> <b>in</b> the study. Our results suggest that <b>mortality</b> rates, especially <b>in</b> natural beds, can emerge from a complex synergy of different factors. Moreover, we propose in situ controlled systems based on PVC cages as a useful method to control infaunal bivalve <b>mortalities</b> <b>in</b> natural beds.

5|$|Red foxes {{are still}} widely persecuted as pests, with human-caused deaths {{among the highest}} causes of <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> the species. Annual fox kills are: UK 21,500–25,000 (2000); Germany 600,000 (2000–2001); Austria 58,000 (2000–2001); Sweden 58,000 (1999–2000); Finland 56,000 (2000–2001); Denmark 50,000 (1976–1977); Switzerland 34,832 (2001); Norway 17,000 (2000–2001); Saskatchewan (Canada) 2,000 (2000–2001); Nova Scotia (Canada) 491 (2000–2001); Minnesota (US) 4,000-8,000 (average annual {{trapping}} harvest 2002-2009); New Mexico (US) 69 (1999–2000).|$|E
5|$|Some {{antioxidant}} supplements may promote {{disease and}} increase <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> humans under certain conditions. Hypothetically, free radicals induce an endogenous response that protects against exogenous radicals (and possibly other toxic compounds). Free radicals may increase life span. This increase may be prevented by antioxidants, providing direct evidence that toxic radicals may mitohormetically exert life extending and health promoting effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} a Whippet is large and slow beating, often being arrhythmic or even {{intermittent}} when the animal is at rest. This sometimes causes concern to the owner, or to the vet not experienced with the breed. Whippets will, however, demonstrate a regular heartbeat during exercise. In a health survey conducted by The Kennel Club cardiac problems were shown to be the second leading cause of <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> Whippets.|$|E
50|$|The molting in {{crustaceans}} is an endocrine-controlled process. In {{the marine}} penaeid shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, exposure to endosulfan resulted increased susceptibility to acute toxicity and increased <b>mortalities</b> <b>in</b> the postmolt {{stage of the}} shrimp.|$|R

5|$|The {{life span}} of {{peregrine}} falcons in the wild is up to 15.5years. <b>Mortality</b> <b>in</b> the first year is 59–70%, declining to 25–32% annually in adults. Apart from such anthropogenic threats as collision with human-made objects, the peregrine may be killed by larger hawks and owls.|$|E
5|$|There are no interventional {{studies that}} {{directly}} show mortality benefit of cholesterol lowering in FH. Rather, evidence of benefit {{is derived from}} a number of trials conducted in people who have polygenic hypercholesterolemia (in which heredity plays a smaller role). Still, a 1999 observational study of a large British registry showed that <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> people with FH had started to improve in the early 1990s when statins were introduced.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings {{in an attempt to}} estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E

40|$|Mass <b>mortalities</b> <b>in</b> bivalve {{populations have}} long been of {{particular}} concern, especially when the species supports a commercial fishery or is of conservation interest. Here we consider the evidence of mass mortalities of the edible cockle, Cerastoderma edule (L.). Through {{the construction of a}} conceptual model eight potential factors (or groups of factors) which may cause mass mortalities are identified and reviewed. These include: food limitation; density; oxygen depletion and organic loadings; temperature and salinity; parasites, pathogens and commensals; toxicants and other persistent pollutants; predation, and changes in sediment, suspended solids, topography and bathymetry. The interplay between factors in recognized and discussed based on evidence mainly from the published literature relating to temperate edible cockle beds. Anecdotal evidence is also reported from a structured survey of site-specific evidence provided by fisheries managers in England and Wales. Case studies from the UK and Europe indicate that there is often no single, clear generic cause of mass <b>mortalities</b> <b>in</b> cockle populations. The importance of linked site-specific scientific investigations and laboratory-based experiments to fill the gaps in our current understanding of mass <b>mortalities</b> <b>in</b> bivalve species is highlighted as necessary to take account of both local extrinsic and intrinsic factors...|$|R
40|$|Changes <b>in</b> <b>mortality</b> {{behavior}} <b>in</b> 1950 s- 1970 s pose a fluctuation of Czech population's mortality {{trend and}} still {{have an impact on}} current level of life expectancy. The thesis focuses on <b>mortality</b> process <b>in</b> that period from cross-sectional and longitudinal approach and tries to identify how the mortality changes affected age intervals older than 30 and influenced cohorts which were in these age intervals in observed period. In the thesis Arriaga's decomposition method was used for quantification of <b>mortality</b> changes <b>in</b> particular age intervals and their affect on changes of life expectancy. The obtained results show that mostly age groups older than 60 were more sensitive to mortality fluctuations...|$|R
5|$|As {{with most}} small birds, <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> {{the first year}} of life is high, but adults aged three to four years are {{regularly}} recorded, and the record is more than seven years. Eggs, chicks and fledglings of this ground-nesting species are taken by stoats, weasels and crows such as the European magpie, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey, particularly the sparrowhawk. Small birds are also {{at the mercy of the}} weather, particularly when migrating, but also on the breeding and wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 about 289,000 women (800 per day) in {{the world}} died due to pregnancy-related causes, with large {{differences}} between developed and developing countries. Maternal <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> western nations had been steadily falling, and forms the subject of annual reports and reviews. Yet, between 1987 and 2011, maternal <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> the United States rose from 7.2 to 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, this {{is reflected in the}} Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR). By contrast rates as high as 1,000 per birth are reported {{in the rest of the}} world, with the highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which account for 86% of such deaths. These deaths are rarely investigated, yet the World Health Organization considers that 99% of these deaths, the majority of which occur within 24 hours of childbirth, are preventable if the appropriate infrastructure, training, and facilities were in place. In these resource-poor countries, maternal health is further eroded by poverty and adverse economic factors which impact the roads, health care facilities, equipment and supplies in addition to limited skilled personnel. Other problems include cultural attitudes towards sexuality, contraception, child marriage, home birth and the ability to recognise medical emergencies. The direct causes of these maternal deaths are hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, sepsis and unskilled abortion. In addition malaria and AIDS complicate pregnancy. In the period 2003–2009 hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, accounting for 27% of deaths in developing countries and 16% in developed countries.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, a {{wide variety}} of causes have contributed to the condor's decline. Its low clutch size (one young per nest), {{combined}} with a late age of sexual maturity, make the bird vulnerable to artificial population decline. Significant past damage to the condor population has also been attributed to poaching, especially for museum specimens, lead poisoning (from eating animals containing lead shot), DDT poisoning, electric power lines, egg collecting, and habitat destruction. During the California Gold Rush, some condors were even kept as pets. The leading cause of <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> nestling condors is the ingestion of trash that is fed to them by their parents.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with any condition that could {{increase the risk of}} lactic acidosis, including kidney disorders (arbitrarily defined as creatinine levels over 150 μmol/l (1.7mg/dl),), lung disease and liver disease. According to the prescribing information, heart failure (in particular, unstable or acute congestive heart failure) increases the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin. A 2007 systematic review of controlled trials, however, suggested metformin is the only antidiabetic drug not associated with any measurable harm {{in people with}} heart failure, and it may reduce <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> comparison with other antidiabetic agents.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{threatened}} by humans indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting {{is a significant}} cause of <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> seals and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include California sea lions, Hawaiian monk seals, northern fur seals and brown fur seals. Pinnipeds are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are {{near the top of}} food chains and have large reserves of blubber. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers, decreased reproductivity and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. Other man-made threats include habitat destruction by oil and gas exploitation, encroachment by boats, and underwater noise.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{estimate}} {{the extent to}} which the changes in the main cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, smoking, and serum cholesterol concentration) can explain the observed changes <b>in</b> <b>mortality</b> from stroke <b>in</b> Finland during the past 20 years. DESIGN [...] Predicted changes <b>in</b> <b>mortality</b> from cerebrovascular disease mortality were calculated by a proportional hazards model from data obtained in cross sectional population surveys in 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, and 1992. Predicted changes were compared with the observed changes <b>in</b> <b>mortality</b> statistics. SETTING [...] North Karelia and Kuopio provinces, Finland. SUBJECTS [...] 16, 741 men and 16, 389 women aged 30 - 59 randomly selected from the national population register, of whom 14, 054 men and 14, 546 women participated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Levels of risk factors and predicted and observed changes <b>in</b> <b>mortality</b> from cerebrovascular disease.
