5|$|The {{wreck of}} Rusalka was {{claimed to have}} been found by divers of the Soviet EPRON salvage agency in 1932, but they <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to salvage it. EPRON's {{location}} does not match that of the ship as discovered in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Frith {{had been}} {{listening}} to music from other cultures, particularly Eastern Europe since the mid-1970s. He <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to notate what he heard, but absorbed it and let it find its way later into his own music. On Gravity Frith mixed up all these different musical styles to make new songs out of them.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 James {{wrote an}} account of the operation, {{entitled}} I Was Monty's Double (published in the United States as The Counterfeit General). The British government <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to stop publication, and in 1958 the book was adapted into a film of the same name. James starred, both as himself and Montgomery, alongside John Mills as an intelligence agent.|$|E

50|$|Jeremy Stephens missed {{weight on}} his first attempt, coming in 3.5 lbs {{overweight}} at 149.5 lbs. After having <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> to cut further, he was fined 20 percent of his fight purse, which went to Dennis Bermudez.|$|R
50|$|This {{statement}} was {{widely seen as}} a triumph for Abbas, as many commentators view it as contradictory to his 14 April 2004 letter. The Bush administration <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> to clarify any perceived discrepancies between the two statements.|$|R
5|$|A midget or fleet {{submarine}} attack. Extensive searches {{immediately following}} the sinking had failed to detect any enemy submarine, and the Allies had <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> at claiming the enormous propaganda value of sinking a capital ship in her home anchorage; consequently, this possibility was quickly discounted. Eyewitnesses also spoke of a reddish-brown fireball, which indicated a magazine explosion; this was confirmed during exploration of the wreck by divers.|$|E
5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E
5|$|Douglas called Downey's {{departure}} {{in favor}} of the publisher a cheap gimmick and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to reach a rapprochement with the senator, who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick leave from Congress for several months. The change in opponents was a mixed blessing for Douglas; it removed the incumbent from the field, but deprived her of the endorsement of the Daily Newsâ€”one of the few big city papers to consistently support her.|$|E
50|$|Royston Wee missed {{weight on}} his first attempt at the weigh ins, coming in at 137 lbs and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> to cut further. Instead, he was fined 20 percent of his fight purse, which went to Ning Guangyou.|$|R
50|$|Maximo Blanco missed {{weight on}} his first attempt at the weigh-ins, coming in at 148.5 lbs. After having <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> to cut further, he was fined 20 percent of his fight purse, which went to Mike De La Torre.|$|R
50|$|Ray Borg missed {{weight on}} his first attempt at the weigh-ins, coming in at 126.75 lbs. After having <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> to cut further, he was fined 20 percent of his fight purse, which went to his {{opponent}} Geane Herrera.|$|R
5|$|The soldiers, most {{of their}} {{equipment}} missing, <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> at further delaying actions, and were unable to communicate with other units because their radio equipment had been lost. As they were retreating, an American aircraft accidentally strafed the column, injuring one South Korean soldier moving with them, further demoralizing the soldiers. The 34th Infantry Regiment began {{to set up a}} new line south of Chonan by nightfall, even though many of its men no longer had equipment to fight with.|$|E
5|$|The {{task force}} sailed on to Euboea, {{and to the}} first major target, Eretria. The Eretrians <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to stop the Persians from landing or {{advancing}} and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days, the Persians attacked the walls, with losses on both sides; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed {{the city to the}} Persians. The city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to Darius's commands, the Persians enslaved all the remaining townspeople.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin {{ultimately}} {{put into}} Leyte Gulf and dropped anchor there on 13 June for repairs and replenishment. Three weeks later, on 1 July, the battleship and her escorts sailed once more for Japanese home waters for carrier air strikes on the enemy's heartland. Nine days later, carrier planes from TF 38 destroyed 72 enemy aircraft {{on the ground}} and smashed industrial sites in the Tokyo area. Wisconsin and the other ships <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> whatsoever to conceal the location of their armada, {{due in large part to}} a weak Japanese response to their presence.|$|E
50|$|Promotional {{newcomer}} Lewis Gonzalez missed {{weight on}} his first attempt at the weigh-ins, coming in 3 lbs overweight at 174 lbs. After having <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> to cut further, he was fined 20 percent of his fight purse, which went to Leandro Silva.|$|R
50|$|The lighter, smaller Ming ships became {{grounded}} {{several times}} more during the battle, {{due to their}} attempts to encircle the Han ships and to board their enemies' ships; the Han intentionally kept to the deeper waters and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> of boarding attacks.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, when Romania, {{aided by}} Nazi Germany, {{for the first}} time in history took control of Transnistria, it <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> to annex the {{occupied}} territory and considered it a temporary buffer zone between Greater Romania and the Soviet front line.|$|R
5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} {{party of}} 30 men was sent {{out from behind}} the third stone wall to see if the British would try and flank the American position. The party ran into the British, who had continued to advance, and they fell back to the stone wall. The Americans behind the wall fired one volley before Glover gave the order to retreat. The Americans retreated across a bridge over the Hutchinson stream, their retreat covered by the 150 men of the 14th Continentals who engaged in an artillery duel with the British. Howe camped on a hill {{on the opposite side of}} the stream but <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to cross the stream.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's assassin Godse <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> {{to escape}} and {{was seized by}} the witnesses. He was arrested. In the weeks that followed, his {{collaborators}} were arrested as well. Godse was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha. They were tried in court at Delhi's Red Fort. At his trial, Godse did not deny the charges nor express any remorse. According to Claude Markovits, a French historian noted for his studies of colonial India, Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacence towards Muslims, holding Gandhi responsible for the frenzy of violence and sufferings during the subcontinent's partition into Pakistan and India. Godse accused Gandhi of subjectivism and of acting as if only he had a monopoly of the truth. Godse was found guilty and executed in 1949.|$|E
5|$|The reason no {{successful}} rescue {{was ever}} effected {{lies in the}} remoteness of the Hebrides from the anglophone world in the early 18th century. No reliable naval charts of the area became available until 1776. Without local assistance and knowledge, finding a captive in this wilderness would have required a significant expeditionary force. Nonetheless, the lack of action taken by Edinburgh society in general and her children in particular to retrieve {{one of their own}} is remarkable. The Kirk hierarchy, for example, <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to contact her or convey news of her condition to the capital, yet they could easily have done so. Whatever the call of morality and natural justice may have suggested, John Chiesley's daughter evidently did not command a sympathetic audience in her home town.|$|E
50|$|Francisco Trevino missed {{weight on}} his first attempt at the weigh ins, coming in at 160 lbs. He was given {{additional}} {{time to make the}} weight limit, but <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> to cut further. Instead, he was fined 20 percent of his fight purse, which went to Sage Northcutt.|$|R
50|$|Randa Markos missed {{weight on}} her first attempt at the weigh ins, coming in at 117.5 lbs. She was given {{additional}} {{time to make the}} weight limit, but <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> to cut further. Instead, she was fined 20 percent of her fight purse, which went to Jocelyn Jones-Lybarger.|$|R
50|$|James East, in his sixties, <b>made</b> <b>no</b> further <b>attempt</b> {{to return}} to elected office.|$|R
5|$|The {{task force}} then sailed around Euboea {{to the first}} major target, Eretria. According to Herodotus, the Eretrians were divided amongst {{themselves}} as to {{the best course of}} action; whether to flee to the highlands, or undergo a siege, or to submit to the Persians. In the event, the majority decision was to remain in the city. The Eretrians <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to stop the Persians landing, or advancing, and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days the Persians attacked the walls, with losses on both sides; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the Persians. The city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to Darius's commands, the Persians enslaved all the remaining townspeople.|$|E
5|$|Violence {{reached a}} peak on 12 August 1969, {{culminating}} in the Battle of the Bogsideâ€”a three-day pitched battle between residents and the RUC. On 14 August units of the British Army were deployed {{at the edge of}} the Bogside and the RUC were withdrawn. The Derry Citizens Defence Association (DCDA) declared their intention to hold the area against both the RUC and the British Army until their demands were met. The British Army <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to enter the area. The situation continued until October 1969 when, following publication of the Hunt Report, military police were allowed in.|$|E
5|$|After Richard's death, King John of England {{failed to}} {{effectively}} defend Normandy against Philip's ongoing campaigns between 1202 and 1204. ChÃ¢teau de Falaise fell to Philip's forces, {{as well as}} castles from Mortain to Pontorson while Philip simultaneously besieged Rouen, which capitulated to French forces on 24June 1204, effectively ending Norman independence. Philip laid siege to ChÃ¢teau Gaillard, which was captured after a long siege from September 1203 to March 1204. As Philip continued the siege throughout the winter and King John <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to relieve the castle, {{it was only a}} matter of time before the castellan was forced to capitulate. The main source for the siege is Philippidos, a poem by William the Breton, Philip's chaplain. As a result, modern scholars have paid little attention to the fate of the civilians of Les Andelys during the siege.|$|E
2500|$|Delaware never {{produced}} a full regiment for the Confederacy, but neither did it emancipate slaves as did Missouri and West Virginia. District of Columbia citizens <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> to secede {{and through the}} war years, referendums sponsored by President Lincoln approved systems of compensated emancipation and slave confiscation from [...] "disloyal citizens".|$|R
60|$|Once, {{towards the}} end of February, Mrs Buggins seduced her lodger down into her parlour in the area, and Miss Mackenzie thought she {{perceived}} that something of the old servant's manners had returned to her. She was more respectful than she had been of late, and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> at smart, ill-natured speeches.|$|R
5000|$|Although Southcott had {{admitted}} at trial that it <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> {{to purchase a}} comparable property, one can argue that a complete failure to make any efforts to mitigate is tantamount to that type of admission. Either way, damages for breach of contract {{continue to be the}} only remedy that the buyer should expect.|$|R
5|$|At this {{juncture}} Richard saw Henry at some distance behind his main force. Seeing this, Richard decided {{to end the}} fight quickly by killing the enemy commander. He led a charge of mounted men around the melee and tore into Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800â€“1000knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends. Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer Sir William Brandon in the initial charge and unhorsed burly John Cheyne, Edward IV's former standard-bearer, with {{a blow to the}} head from his broken lance. French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to engage in combat himself.|$|E
5|$|Disgruntled, Mau began {{recruiting}} for a coup, targeting KhÃ¡nh, who {{had been}} moved to the I Corps in the far north of South Vietnam to keep him far away from Saigon. KhÃ¡nh <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to hide his annoyance at not being given a more important job, and had long been regarded as an ambitious and unscrupulous officer by his colleagues. Mau persuaded the junta to install Thi as KhÃ¡nh's deputy in I Corps. He tricked the junta by telling them that as KhÃ¡nh had played a large part in putting down the 1960 coup attempt, Thi would still be harboring resentment. According to Mau, Thi would thus be an ideal mechanism for keeping the disliked KhÃ¡nh in check. Privately, Mau predicted that Thi would act as a bridge between him in Saigon, and KhÃ¡nh in Huáº¿. He was correct in thinking the 1960 conflict would be irrelevant as allegiances shifted over time and that the pair would work together for their current aims.|$|E
5|$|Sailing from Rodriguez on 22 November, the 70 {{vessels of}} the {{invasion}} fleet reached Grand Baie on 29 November. The French <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to resist the landing either at sea or on land and Keating was able to rapidly advance on the capital, hastily mobilised militia units falling back before the British advance. On 30 November, Keating crossed the RiviÃ¨re du Tombeau after the militia garrison withdrew and in the evening his forward units were skirmishing with Decaen's garrison of Port Napoleon {{a few miles from}} the capital. The following morning, Decaen's field commander, EdmÃ©-Martin Vandermaesen made a stand, forming a line on a rise outside the town that blocked Keating's advance. Engaging the centre, Keating used his superior numbers to outflank and defeat the French garrison and Port Napoleon fell. A ceasefire was agreed on 2 December and the following day Decaen surrendered, although he and his men were repatriated to France with their standards and personal weapons.|$|E
50|$|Many of Kurt's {{friends and}} family have {{supported}} the suicide verdict. Bandmate Krist Novoselic has strongly voiced his opinion that Kurt killed himself. Kurt's friend Everett True also shared this opinion, along with Dave Grohl. Kurt's father, Donald Cobain (who worked with Washington State Patrol), has <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> to reopen the case, despite his professional connections.|$|R
50|$|Charles Oliveira missed {{weight on}} his first attempt at the weigh ins, coming in at 150.5 lbs. He was given {{additional}} {{time to make the}} weight limit, but <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> to cut further. Instead, he was fined 20 percent of his fight purse, which went to Myles Jury. This marked the third time that Oliveira missed weight in his UFC career.|$|R
