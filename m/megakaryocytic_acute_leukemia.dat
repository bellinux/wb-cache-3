40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Four {{years ago}} it was {{discovered}} that nearly all cases of transient myeloproliferative disorder and <b>acute</b> <b>megakaryocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> in children with Down syndrome acquire mutations in the hematopoietic transcription factor gene GATA 1. Studies within the past year, described within this review, have provided tremendous insights into the role of GATA 1 mutations in these malignancies. RECENT FINDINGS: In the past year, our understanding of the molecular and cellular consequences of GATA 1 mutations has been greatly enhanced. Most importantly, we have learned that these mutations, which result in the exclusive production of the short GATA 1 isoform named GATA 1 s, have a distinct effect on fetal liver progenitors. In addition, multiple studies have shown that GATA 1 s can substitute for GATA 1 in many aspects of megakaryocytic maturation. Finally, an important clinical study has revealed that GATA 1 mutations alone are insufficient for leukemia. SUMMARY: Leukemia in children with Down syndrome requires at least three cooperating events [...] trisomy 21, a GATA 1 mutation, and a third, as yet undefined, genetic alteration. Recent studies have provided tremendous insights into the GATA 1 side of the story. Future experiments with human patient samples and mouse models will likely increase our awareness of the role of trisomy 21 in transient myeloproliferative disorder and <b>acute</b> <b>megakaryocytic</b> <b>leukemia...</b>|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{mechanism}} by which cells decide to skip mitosis to become polyploid is largely undefined. Here we used a high-content image-based screen to identify small-molecule probes that induce polyploidization of megakaryocytic leukemia cells and serve as perturbagens to help understand this process. Our study implicates five networks of kinases that regulate the switch to polyploidy. Moreover, we find that dimethylfasudil (diMF, H- 1152 P) selectively increased polyploidization, mature cell-surface marker expression, and apoptosis of malignant megakaryocytes. An integrated target identification approach employing proteomic and shRNA screening revealed that a major target of diMF is Aurora kinase A (AURKA). We further find that MLN 8237 (Alisertib), a selective inhibitor of AURKA, induced polyploidization and expression of mature megakaryocyte markers in <b>acute</b> <b>megakaryocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (AMKL) blasts and displayed potent anti-AMKL activity in vivo.

40|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS), with trisomy of chromosome 21 (HSA 21), is the commonest human aneuploidy.

Trisomy of the Erg gene is required for myeloproliferation in the Ts(1716) 65 Dn DS mouse model. We demonstrate here that genetic changes specifically attributable to trisomy of Erg lead to lineage priming of primitive and early multipotential progenitor cells in Ts(1716) 65 Dn mice, excess megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors, and malignant myeloproliferation. Gene expression changes dependent on trisomy of Erg in Ts(1716) 65 Dn multilineage progenitor cells were correlated with those associated with trisomy of HSA 21 in human DS hematopoietic stem and primitive progenitor cells.

In addition, somatic mutations of the GATA 1 gene have been detected in nearly all DS TMD and AMkL cases and not in leukemia cases in non-DS children. GATA 1 mutations are key factors linked to both leukemogenesis and the high cure rates of DS AMkL patients.

Stable transfection of wild-type GATA 1 cDNA into the Down syndrome AMkL cell line CMK resulted in decreased (8 - to 17 -fold) ara-C sensitivity and a threefold-lower generation of the active ara-C metabolite ara-CTP compared with that for mock-transfected CMK cells. High intracellular levels of uridine arabinoside (ara-U) (an inactive ara-C catabolite generated by cytidine deaminase) and cytidine deaminase transcripts were detected in GATA 1 -transfected CMK sublines, whereas no ara-U was detected in mock-transfected cells.

On the basis of the role of GATA 1 mutations in DS AMkL, we analyzed the mutational spectrum of GATA 1 mutations to begin elucidating possible mechanisms by which these sequence alterations arise. Mutational analysis revealed a predominance of small insertion/deletion, duplication, and base substitution mutations, including G:C>T:A, G:C>A:T, and A:T>G:C. This mutational spectrum points to potential oxidative stress and aberrant folate metabolism secondary to genes on chromosome 21 (eg, cystathionine-β-synthase, superoxide dismutase) as potential causes of GATA 1 mutations. Furthermore, DNA repair capacity evaluated in DS and non-DS patient samples provided evidence that the base excision repair pathway is compromised in DS tissues, suggesting that inability to repair DNA damage also may {{play a critical role in}} the unique susceptibility of DS children to develop leukemia.

When compared with <b>acute</b> myeloid <b>leukemia</b> and <b>acute</b> lymphoblastic <b>leukemia,</b> patients with biphenotypic <b>acute</b> <b>leukemia</b> showed significantly higher incidence of CD 34 antigen expression, unfavorable karyotypes, and extramedullary infiltration (p< 0. 05). In this cohort of patients with biphenotypic <b>acute</b> <b>leukemia,</b> t(9; 22) was the most common abnormality in chromosome structure. The median disease-free survival and overall sur-vival in biphenotypic <b>acute</b> <b>leukemia</b> patients was five months and ten months, respec-tively, significantly shorter than those in <b>acute</b> myeloid <b>leukemia</b> and <b>acute</b> lymphoblastic <b>leukemia</b> patients (p< 0. 05) ...|$|R
50|$|Very rarely, chloroma {{can occur}} without a known {{pre-existing}} or concomitant diagnosis of <b>acute</b> <b>leukemia,</b> <b>acute</b> promyleocytic <b>leukemia</b> or MDS/MPS; {{this is known}} as primary chloroma. Diagnosis is particularly challenging in this situation (see below). In almost all reported cases of primary chloroma, <b>acute</b> <b>leukemia</b> has developed shortly afterward (median time to development of <b>acute</b> <b>leukemia</b> 7 months, range 1-25 months). Therefore, primary chloroma could be considered an initial manifestation of <b>acute</b> <b>leukemia,</b> rather than a localized process, and could be treated as such. Where disease development or markers indicate progresses to <b>acute</b> promyleocytic <b>leukemia</b> (AML3) treatment should be tailored to this form of disease.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{two models}} for {{constructing}} <b>acute</b> <b>leukemia</b> classifiers using the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) gene selection method {{in conjunction with}} the Bayesian Networks (BNs) have been proposed. In the first model, genes of the <b>acute</b> <b>leukemia</b> training dataset are ranked using the SNR method and then top ranked genes are selected and used to construct the <b>acute</b> <b>leukemia</b> BN classifier. In the second model, genes of the <b>acute</b> <b>leukemia</b> training dataset are clustered using thek-means clustering and then genes of each cluster are ranked using the SNR method after that top ranked genes from gene clusters are selected and used to construct the <b>acute</b> <b>leukemia</b> BN classifier. From the experimental evaluation, the results showed that the classification accuracies achieved by the <b>acute</b> <b>leukemia</b> classifiers constructed according to either of these two models are good compared with the classification accuracies achieved in other studies. The results also indicated that the second model is better than the first model...|$|R

These rather uncommon manifestations of <b>acute</b> <b>leukemia</b> complicate strict taxonomical sub grouping {{as well as their}} management. Rapid identification & swift management may restrict further neurological damage, while achieving hematological remission. Case description: A 16  year female presented with gradual onset paraplegia for 7  months, a history of multiple blood transfusions in the past 2  years, pancytopenia, atypical cells in peripheral smear; the hematological and bone marrow work up revealed a diagnosis of: MPAL, B/Myeloid, NOS [Multi Phenotypic <b>Acute</b> <b>Leukemia,</b> B cell {lymphoid}/Myeloid, not otherwise specified]. An ALL type induction regimen was started. The management strategy, it's rationale and the clinical outcome are discussed. Conclusion: For routine neurosurgical practice, these entities are extremely rare; and hence a working knowledge is very essential for appropriate & timely management notwithstanding the neurosurgical desire to rule out the compressive lesions first. Neurological status deterioration may be halted with timely institution of appropriate chemotherapy. In the extensive literature review in pubmed, this may be only the 1 st case of MPAL with extramedullary neurological manifestation, at the first clinical presentation...|$|R
