5|$|In his popular books, he {{has argued}} that the human faculty for {{language}} is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.|$|E
25|$|In Hodding Carter: The Reconstruction of a Racist, author Ann Waldron <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that {{although}} Carter crusaded for racial equality, he hedged on condemning segregation, and that after Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, he attacked the intransigent White Citizens' Council, but only supported gradual integration.|$|E

25|$|Among other factors, declining {{membership}} of organized religions {{and the growth}} of secularism in the western world have given rise to this broader view of spirituality. Even the secular are finding use for spiritual beliefs. In his books, Michael Mamas <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for integrating Eastern spiritual knowledge with Western rational thought.|$|E
25|$|Art historians {{disagree}} {{on the origins of}} Haitian Vodou arts. Suzanne Blier <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that they come from the coastal areas of Benin and Togo. Robert Farris Thompson makes a plausible connection with Central Africa based on similarities with nkisi figures from the Kongo, and cosmograms, flags, drums and dances from that region.|$|E
25|$|Billy 'The Mexican' McFarland—North Antrim and Londonderry (Unknown–2013) He {{earned his}} {{nickname}} {{because of his}} moustache and swarthy appearance, and had overall command of the UDA's North Antrim and Derry brigade {{at the time of}} the Good Friday Agreement.

25|$|Hamilton also <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for duration, {{meaning a}} presidential term {{long enough to}} promote {{stability}} in the government. While Hamilton elaborates {{on the importance of}} duration in Federalist No. 73, he argues briefly in Federalist No. 70 that the prospect of more time in office will motivate a president to act in concert with the views of the public.|$|E
25|$|Ishida Hitoshi <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{that the}} image of the bishōnen is more about a {{grounding}} in sexuality than a transcendence of it, drawing on the idea of the image as being a refuge for alternative methods of looking at sexual natures, and sexual realities, at least since the 60's, rather than the elegiac aesthetics of usages in an earlier era.|$|E
25|$|Elst {{is known}} to be {{sympathetic}} to Hindutva, a Hindu nationalist movement. In Ram Janmabhoomi vs Babri Masjid, Elst <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for an enduring historical tradition associating the Ram Janmabhoomi site with the birthplace of Rama, the Hindu god/king. The book, which was published by Voice of India, a publication house devoted to furthering the Hindu cause, brought attention and praise for Elst from L. K. Advani, the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party.|$|E

[...] Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that House of Cards is a love story on many levels but most {{importantly}} between Frank and Claire.|$|E
500|$|At the Stark army camp, Catelyn {{consoles}} Robb, who grieves {{over his}} father's death. Robb vows revenge on the Lannisters, but Catelyn reminds {{him that they}} must first rescue Arya and Sansa. As the Starks consult their followers over whether to support Stannis or Renly Baratheon, both of whom have challenged Joffrey Baratheon's claim to the throne, Lord Greatjon Umber instead <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for Northern independence. Theon Greyjoy and the others agree, proclaiming Robb the [...] "King in the North". Later, Catelyn interrogates the captive Jaime Lannister. He admits having pushed Bran out of the tower window, but refuses to tell why.|$|E
40|$|In this commentary, we <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that <b>the</b> {{analysis}} {{of terrorism and}} counterterrorism {{must be based on}} an integrated theory that links both issues together. Terrorist groups' ultimate goals must be distinguished from their strategic goals and the strategic logic by which they employ terror and select targets to further their ultimate goals. The strategic logic of terrorism is thus key to understanding patterns of terrorism and the counter-reaction by governments against it. We <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for a unified approach and suggest major areas for future research...|$|R

500|$|In {{discussing}} contextual cues to vowel identifications in English, [...] {{note that}} controlling for dialect is largely unimportant for eliciting identifications when vowels are placed between consonants, possibly because the /CVC/ structure often forms lexical items that can aid in identification; identifying vowels in isolation, which don't often carry such lexical information, must be matched to the listener's set of vowel prototypes with less deviation than in consonantal contexts. In {{the first chapter}} of , Peter Trudgill <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that these semantic contexts form the basis of intelligibility across varieties and that the process is irregular and ad hoc rather than the result of any sort of rule-governed passive polylectal competence.|$|E
500|$|In the 261 page book, Ezra Levant <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that {{in terms}} of four {{criteria}} (the environment, conflict, economic and social justice and freedom from oppression) the Canadian petroleum industry is [...] "heads above other crude producers like Saudi Arabia, Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela". Highlighting perceived hypocrisy from Western progressive and environmental movements, the author confronts what he sees as unfair and excessive criticism of oil sands, stating that the [...] "oil sands are not perfect, and criticizing them is fair game. But why has criticism of the oil sands been so disproportionately loud compared to criticism of other, larger, more disturbing sources of oil?".|$|E
500|$|Sappho 16 is a {{fragment}} of a poem by the archaic Greek lyric poet Sappho. [...] It is from Book I of the Alexandrian edition of Sappho's poetry, and is known from a second-century papyrus discovered at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth century. [...] Sappho 16 is a love poem – the genre for which Sappho was best known – which praises the beauty of the narrator's beloved, Anactoria, and expresses the speaker's desire for her now that she is absent. [...] It <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that the most beautiful thing in the world is whatever one desires, using Helen of Troy's elopement with Paris as a mythological exemplum to support this argument. [...] The poem is at least 20 lines long, though it is uncertain whether the poem ends at line 20 or continues for another stanza.|$|E

40|$|The so‐called ‘re‐identification condition’ (K elly 2011) {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the most prominent argument for nonconceptualism, the argument from fineness of grain. A number of authors have recently argued that the condition should be modified or discarded altogether, with devastating implications for the nonconceptualist (see, e. g., B rewer 2005, C huard 2006). The aim of this paper is to show that the situation is even more dire for nonconceptualists, for even if the re‐identification condition remains in its original form, the argument from fineness of grain still fails to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for nonconceptualism. <b>The</b> paper's central <b>case</b> rests on two claims: according to the first, if the re‐identification condition holds, then some beliefs will represent some properties nonconceptually; and according to the second, if some beliefs represent some properties nonconceptually, the argument from fineness of grain fails to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for nonconceptualism in any relevant sense. It follows that if the re‐identification condition holds, the argument from fineness of grain fails to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for nonconceptualism...|$|R

500|$|In live performance, loudness—an [...] "onslaught of sound," [...] in {{sociologist}} Deena Weinstein's description—is considered vital. In {{his book}} Metalheads, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as [...] "the sensory equivalent of war." [...] Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and The Who, early heavy metal acts such as Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume. As Blue Cheer's Dick Peterson put it, [...] "All we knew was we wanted more power." [...] A 1977 {{review of a}} Motörhead concert noted how [...] "excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact." [...] Weinstein <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that {{in the same way}} that melody is the main element of pop and rhythm is the main focus of house music, powerful sound, timbre, and volume are the key elements of metal. She argues that the loudness is designed to [...] "sweep the listener into the sound" [...] and to provide a [...] "shot of youthful vitality".|$|E
500|$|... "Federalist No. 10", {{in which}} Madison {{discusses}} {{the means of}} preventing rule by majority faction and advocates a large, commercial republic, is generally regarded {{as the most important}} of the 85 articles from a philosophical perspective; it is complemented by [...] "Federalist No. 14", in which Madison takes the measure of the United States, declares it appropriate for an extended republic, and concludes with a memorable defense of the constitutional and political creativity of the Federal Convention. In [...] "Federalist No. 84", Hamilton <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that {{there is no need to}} amend the Constitution by adding a Bill of Rights, insisting that the various provisions in the proposed Constitution protecting liberty amount to a [...] "bill of rights". [...] "Federalist No. 78", also written by Hamilton, lays the groundwork for the doctrine of judicial review by federal courts of federal legislation or executive acts. [...] "Federalist No. 70" [...] presents Hamilton's case for a one-man chief executive. In [...] "Federalist No. 39", Madison presents the clearest exposition of what has come to be called [...] "Federalism". [...] In [...] "Federalist No. 51", Madison distils arguments for checks and balances in an essay often quoted for its justification of government as [...] "the greatest of all reflections on human nature." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} acts of newly elected Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin was an {{executive}} order to remove clerks' names from the state marriage licenses. Bevin expressed his hope on November 6, 2015, that the executive order will protect the religious beliefs of officials {{who are opposed to}} gay marriage. Kim Davis and her attorneys at Liberty Counsel immediately requested that the court dismiss her appeals, because the new regulation provides a religious accommodation for her and <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> moot. Bunning agreed, dismissing the three lawsuits filed against her, saying the new governor's order to use a license form that does not require the county clerk's signature has removed the controversy before the court. Davis' attorneys asserted that such a legislative victory resolves the matter; the couples did not prevail against Davis, therefore they are not entitled to demand that Davis reimburse their legal fees. However, by May 2017, a Cincinnati federal appeals court found that Bunning had erred in finding that damages claims by David Ermold and David Moore became moot, saying, [...] "The district court's characterization of this case as simply contesting the 'no marriage licenses' policy is inaccurate, because Ermold and Moore did not seek an injunction—they sought only damages"; observing that the record does not prevent damages claims. The three-judge panel granted leave for the couple to sue for damages over one marriage license. Their case was sent back to Bunning, where he stated that the state of Kentucky was obligated to pay $222,695 in legal fees. The ACLU itself sued Davis to recover $233,000 in legal fees, but the motion was denied; the organization was not a [...] "prevailing party" [...] in the legal action.|$|E
