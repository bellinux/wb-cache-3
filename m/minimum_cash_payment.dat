50|$|In {{anticipation}} of the US Government’s offer being viewed as illegal, an independent European/Asian investment group made a counteroffer to the insurers that called for a <b>minimum</b> upfront <b>cash</b> <b>payment</b> of US$15 million {{with the intention of}} returning the satellite to a geosynchronous orbit using the lunar flyby mission and thereafter providing commercial services. Negotiations were slow to start in spite of the alternative $10M purchase proposal from the US Government which was 33% lower than the improved offer from the European/Asian investment group.|$|R

These deals are offered by finance companies or banks in conjunction with a manufacturer or dealer network.

The indirect cost will include paying a processing fee, a significant amount as advance EMIs (equated monthly installments), as well as a <b>minimum</b> <b>cash</b> down <b>payment.</b> Often, the biggest cost may involve forfeiting a cash discount which might otherwise be available on a cash purchase.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} direct <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> on whole blood donations. The German blood collection system is based on both, paid and unpaid blood donations. We {{take advantage of a}} quasi-natural experiment, in which one blood donation site changes its compensation scheme from paid to unpaid, while all other donation sites maintain their payment schemes. We show that <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> increase donation volume without affecting blood quality. This result casts doubt on the notion that monetary incentives crowd out intrinsic motivation to donate blood. Policymakers should thus reconsider direct <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> to address public health concerns about blood shortages...|$|R

40|$|Cash {{is still}} the most common means of daily payments. The large number of <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> is {{supported}} by a costly distribution system in which retailers, banks and central banks participate. Currency is issued in a range of bank note and coin denominations to facilitate efficiency in <b>cash</b> <b>payments.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to study the performance of a currency range in practice. It presents a number of empirical studies on <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> at the individual <b>payment</b> level, whereby <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> are viewed as the outcome of a choice process. This type of analysis calls for labor-intensive data collection methods {{and the development of a}} sophisticated econometric model. This thesis introduces such a model for <b>cash</b> <b>payments,</b> and it reviews its application to three unique data sets of <b>cash</b> <b>payments.</b> The data concern payments in the Netherlands before and after the transition from the guilder to the euro in 2002, and payments in an experimental setting. The estimation results allow for an assessment of the use of different bank note and coin denominations in <b>cash</b> <b>payments,</b> and of possible preferences for one of more denominations. Currency research generally approaches currency use from a macroeconomic point of view. The novelty of this thesis is that it contributes to currency research by focusing on individual <b>cash</b> <b>payments.</b> Jeanine Kippers (1973) obtained her master´s degree in econometrics from the Erasmus University Rotterdam in 1997. In the same year she was employed by De Nederlandsche Bank. She participated in the preparations of the cash changeover from guilder to euro in 2002, and contributed to the development of a European cash distribution system and the restructuring of the national distribution system. During her employment at the central bank she started her research on currency use, which resulted in several papers that have been published or are currently under review. In January 2004 she joined the Pensionand Insurance Supervisory authority, as a policy advisor in the (international) field of insurance supervision...|$|R

40|$|By setting bounds {{on money}} growth, the {{commodity}} standard {{is a solution}} to the monetary authority’s time inconsistency problem, which arises from the fixed wage structure of the economy. If there is a supply shock to the backing commodity, the suspension of the commodity standard may be desirable in terms of stabilisation of production and consumption. By representing a credible commitment to return to the commodity standard, the suspension of <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> maintains the value and circulation of money.

40|$|One of {{the more}} {{intractable}} problems {{in the area of}} monetary economics is the measurement of <b>cash</b> <b>payments.</b> Whereas the stock of currency in circulation [C] is well defined and readily measured, the transactions velocity of currency [Vc] (the average number of times currency turns over in any given period) is difficult to measure. This paper examines alternative methods for estimating the average velocity of currency and the denomination specific velocity of cash employing data for the Netherlands. Estimates of the volume of <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> are necessary to meaningfully measure the volume of total payments [MV] in an economy and hence, the total volume of transactions [PT]. Once the volume of <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> is known, it is possible to employ Fisher’s equation of exchange [MV=PT] as a more general conceptual and empirical alternative to Keynes’ more limited income-expenditure [Y= C+I+G] identity. <b>Cash</b> <b>payments,</b> Velocity of currency, Equation of exchange, total transactions, underground economy. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{establishment}} and funding of a Swedish-style welfare state, with state provision of {{a long list of}} “merit goods”plus targeted <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> to those in special circumstances, has a higher priority than large <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> to all citizens, as called for in the Stakeholding and Basic Income proposals. An analysis of the Swedish budget shows that advanced countries cannot do both at once, given current levels of per capita income. Other problems with a near-term rapid introduction of large universal <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> include the disincentive to work for pay, which would reduce per capita income and make the problem of financing such payments through taxation even more acute, the probable retrograde effects on gender equality, and a reduction in the power of parents vis-a-vis their teenage children. After the achievement of a well-established welfare state, rises over time in productivity may gradually open up room in the national budget for universal <b>cash</b> <b>payments.</b> Such payments, if the country then wishes to make them, could be phased in slowly as the room appears...|$|R
