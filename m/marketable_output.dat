40|$|Analysis of {{agricultural}} production generally ignores the undesirable outputs (such as soil erosion) that are jointly produced with desirable, <b>marketable</b> <b>outputs.</b> In this paper we present preliminary TFP results incorporating national level data for off-site damage costs of soil erosion for broad acre agriculture between 1953 and 1994. Following the approach introduced by Repetto et al. (1996), our revised TFP estimates provide interesting results. When {{we assume that}} damage costs per ton of soil erosion are constant, our TFP estimates are higher than estimates omitting the undesirable output. This result {{can be explained by}} the fact that the rate of soil erosion grew more slowly than output increased, or the rate of soil erosion declined and agricultural output remained constant. Defining weak sustainability (i. e., allowing substitution between natural and human capital) as non-declining TFP, our results indicate that Australian broad acre agriculture is sustainable.

The review covers studies from forestry, ecology, economics, agriculture and other disciplines, reflecting the complexity of the issues and the range of research priorities that will need to be addressed in the next few decades. There is strong evidence that the potential for land-use systems to contribute to climate mitigation efforts is significant, but for this to occur it will be necessary that landholders receive incentives to change their current land uses.

Their emphasis highlights the reduction in variable production costs that FMS promises. This paper describes a different approach, namely, to uncover the effects of FMS technology on optimal organizational size. To achieve this end, we must consider factors other than variable production cost savings. This enlarges the scope of the decision model required to evaluate FMS configurations. The investigation proceeds along two diverse, but complementary paths. One is based on a theoretical model, using non-linear breakeven analysis. The second employs empirical data obtained from industrial users. The theoretical model indicates that FMS requires a larger total output than the system it replaces. Empirical results tend to confirm this finding. In addition, FMS alters other managerial considerations, including appropriate marketing strategies. ...|$|E

We focus on the interaction between SO₂ and NOₓ, as they became more highly regulated and estimate shadow prices of the pollutants and the Morishima elasticity of transformation between two pollutants, NOₓ and SO₂, as well as with respect to the desirable output, kilowatt-hours of electricity. As expected, we find that power plants increase NOₓ emissions as they decrease SO₂, i. e. they are substitutes...|$|E

In this paper, we provide a representation of the knowledge base of a firm, defined as the collective knowledge that a firm can use to produce <b>marketable</b> <b>outputs.</b> Here the knowledge base (KB) of the firm will be mapped using patent statistics. In particular, we study the strategic reorientation and subsequent merger of Rhone Poulenc and of Hoechst. Starting from the EPO database, we select the patents of the two firms for the period 1990 - 1998. We study the changes taking place in the KBs of the two firms, both by patent statistics and by lexicographic analysis. The latter technique allows us to create a map representing the technological classes contained in the patents of the two firms and their links. In our representation, the KB takes the form of a network with technological classes as nodes and with links determined by the co-occurrence of given key words in different technological classes. The networks representing the KBs of the two firms change in the course of time following their strategic decisions.

40|$|In the 2000 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, Pillar II of the CAP {{was created}} {{explicitly}} {{to promote the}} production of environmental outputs, such as biodiversity and landscape amenities. In the European Union (EU) New Member States (NMSs), subsistence and semi-subsistence farms coexist with larger commercially orientated farms. Due to {{the high number of}} subsistence and semi- subsistence farms in these countries, new measures in the CAP Pillar II have been developed with the aim of increasing the market integration and competitiveness of these farms. Given the apparent resilience of subsistence agriculture and the policy goal of rapid commercialisation, an assessment of the comparative provision of environmental outputs is timely. The possible environmental effects of an increase in the market integration of agricultural households are studied in this thesis. The methodology employed includes two key stages. In the first stage, an environmental efficiency score for each agricultural' household is estimated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Since there is no price information about the environmental output, an input distance function approach is employed to characterise the multi-output technology used by each agricultural household in the sample. The environmental efficiency is calculated by decomposing the multi-output efficiency into pure technical efficiency (the efficiency to produce the <b>marketable</b> <b>output)</b> and the efficiency related to the production of environmental outputs. In the second stage, the environmental efficiency scores are regressed on several household characteristics, physical and human capital variables, and, most importantly, an index designed to capture the degree of market integration of each holding. The data used in the empirical analysis were collected through a detailed survey of agricultural households conducted in three NMSs (Bulgaria, Poland and Romania) carried out as part of the EU FP 6 SCARLED project (STREP Contract No. SSPE-CT- 2006 - 0044201).

In many cases these have already been applied to cogeneration plants (Boji_C and Stojanovi_C 1996; Silvente and Papageorgiou 2017; Wang et al. 2015; Christidis et al. 2012; Costa and Fichera 2014; Spieker 2013; Steck 2012; Mitra et al. 2013; Bosman et al. n.d.; Bosman 2012). Power gradient restrictions {{in the context of}} economic dispatch are usually implemented by limiting the change in the set power between two time steps Pt[*]=[*] 2 [*]−[*]Pt[*]=[*] 1 [*]≤[*]∆Pmax (Wang et al. 2015; Steck 2012; Arroyo and Conejo 2000; Carrion and Arroyo 2006; Mitra et al. 2013). The forecasted generated and thus marketed power Pavailable is equated with the set power Pset, although due to the inertia of the systems there are sometimes significant differences between these two. For example, if the operating point of a plant is increased from 80 % (time step 1) to 100 % (time step 2) in a system with a maximum power gradient of 20 %, a <b>marketable</b> <b>output</b> of 100 % is assumed in previous work for time step 2. However, assuming a linear power increase, the actual average power output in time step 2 will be only 90 %. Only Bosman et al. take the changed power output into account (Bosman et al. n.d.; Bosman 2012), however, operation of the CHP unit in partial load is excluded, which is an enormous limitation of the approach. This work presents an approach to consider the effect of power gradients on the actual power output also in partial load operation for both electrical and thermal. The approach is then validated with the work of Steck et al. (Steck 2012) with regard to realism, since the some of the here presented model structure is close to Stecks‘work.|$|E

Measuring city competitiveness {{is an attempt}} to estimate a city's relative economic strength and potential. But while cities do compete, their primary purpose is not to produce a <b>marketable</b> <b>output</b> nor to maximize the rate of return on assets. Indeed, cities do not have one output nor clear inputs. Nor can they be bankrupted or liquidated. As such, this research is been undertaken to explore the physical and economic development of Kuala Lumpur pertaining to the office development in order to achieve higher competitive city space. To achieve this aim, the study start by review and discuss the general linkage between the office development and competitive city space; investigate the roles and influences of office development with regards to economic and physical development in cities; analyse the behaviour of headquarters office in relation to the change of office location; examine the issues and problems of office development trend in Kuala Lumpur; and develop recommendations on office development in order to achieve competitive cities. To understand about this research, the literature review has been prepared which focuses on office development towards city competitiveness. This covers an overview of its impact on built environment, role of office development towards city competitiveness, factor influencing office location, activities of the institutions of city competitiveness and management on sustainable competitive advantage were discussed. The study reveals some of the experiences on the growth of city form in urban area in several countries. The study area is Kuala Lumpur, as the fastest growing metropolitan region in the country as well as rank at 26 th position, out of 139 countries in Competitiveness Index. Kuala Lumpur is the capital and economic centre of Malaysia. The Kuala Lumpur office market is robust and is experiencing increasing demand for offices with the expansion of the services sector. With the market poised to improve in terms of rents and capital values, investment is strong with investor funds coming from other countries. These foreign funds seek to invest in offices while a few are even participating in office developments around Kuala Lumpur City through partnership with local developers. From the analysis, the impact of office development in competitive city: Kuala Lumpur, found that in term physical aspect, there are including impact on city planning, infrastructure, urban structure and accessibility.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{economic}} effects of biodiversity loss on <b>marketable</b> agricultural <b>output</b> for intensive agricultural systems, which require an increasing level of artificial capital inputs. A theoretical bio-economic model {{is used to}} derive a hypothesis {{about the effect of}} the state of biodiversity on the optimal crop output both in the longer run and in the transitional path towards the steady-state equilibrium. The hypothesised positive relationship between biodiversity stock and optimal levels of crop output is empirically tested using a stochastic production frontier approach, based on data from a panel of UK specialised cereal farms for the period 1989 - 2000. The results support the theoretical hypothesis. Increases in biodiversity can lead to a continual outward shift in the output frontier (although at a decreasing rate), controlling for the relevant set of labour and capital inputs. Agricultural transition towards biodiversity conservation may be consistent with an increase in crop output in already biodiversity-poor modern agricultural landscapes.

40|$|In Ethiopia, {{intensification}} of agricultural production {{is the primary}} focus of the government’s poverty reduction strategy. Livestock constitute an invaluable resource providing essential goods and services to small-scale poor farmers and their families and communities. Production of high valued livestock products provides a route out of poverty especially where growing urban demand fuels the markets. Water security is a requisite input for livestock production and its resultant contribution to poverty reduction. Typically, one tropical livestock unit (TLU = 250 kg live weight) requires less than 50 litres/day derived from drinking water and moisture in animal feeds. Assuming annual rainfall of 500 to 1000 mm and a stocking rate of one TLU/ha, the drinking water required by livestock is less than 0. 2 % of the intercepted precipitation. While sufficient high quality water is essential to sustaining livestock production, direct water intake is only of minor significance in terms of livestock water budgets in farming systems and watersheds where the water required for feed production can be up to 5000 litres/TLU per day or 100 times the amount directly consumed. Water productivity of livestock may be high or low depending on the context within which livestock production is evaluated. Livestock produced solely with irrigated forage and grain crops may be very inefficient in terms of water consumed for food produced. However, ‘cut-and-carry’ and grazing production relying on consumption of crop residues and tree fodder can be very efficient since the water used for plant production would have been used with or without livestock feeding on it. The stover or feed is simply a by-product of growing crops and does not require additional water for its production. Livestock also provide rural farmers with additional value in terms of consumable and <b>marketable</b> <b>outputs</b> without incurring significant demand for water. Understanding and managing water productivity of livestock presents opportunities to contribute to poverty reduction. Water productivity varies according to the geographic scale being considered and depends largely on the degree to which water is depleted or available to other users or ecosystem services. Livestock have a profound impact on downstream water resources. In urban and peri-urban areas, livestock production may be an ideal agricultural practice in terms of water productivity if downstream contamination can be avoided. Increasing demand for livestock products implies increased future demand for water that can be expected to rival the water requirements for production of all other food products consumed by the urban population. In many cases, livestock management practices jeopardise water quality, human health and aggravate water mediated land degradation. Research is needed to develop practical strategies to enable poor people in rural, peri-urban and urban areas to better manage livestock so that they can realise poverty reducing benefits and minimise harmful effects on themselves and others. An utmost need exists for community based natural resources management, a critical issue of interest to water and livestock managers. Given the paucity of literature on livestock–water interactions, key areas for future research are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand radio {{market is}} one of the most {{deregulated}} in the world. There are no limits on ownership, very few constraints on content and no quotas for local content. New Zealand’s radio environment reflects the strong neo-liberal principles that underpin the open, market-driven New Zealand economy. Political promises and public discussions about the creation of a nationwide commercial-free public radio service for young people had faltered against these principles in the early to mid- 2000 s with strong opposition from incumbent commercial radio interests decrying government interference in their commercial rights. It was in to this environment in 2005 that one half of the foreign-owned radio broadcasting duopoly introduced a radio network into the three main cities that played only New Zealand music – Kiwi FM. Within a year the network had failed to attract sufficient listeners and advertisers to stay on-air and was nearing closure. At this point the Labour government of the day stepped in to save the struggling network by giving it access to temporary free frequencies and funding to make programmes featuring New Zealand music. This was an extraordinary situation in that commercial radio in New Zealand is notable for its focus on producing only programming that will create significant profits for shareholders, rather than public service-type programming benefiting national arts and culture. It was also extraordinary in that the government had intervened to support a commercial company to ensure a failed radio network would survive. This dissertation explores why and how this happened through a grounded theory analysis of the significant amount of official documentation this situation generated, through interviews with key players and other contemporaneous material such as media interviews, blogs and newspaper articles about Kiwi FM. What emerges from this data is evidence of a ‘third-way’ agenda operating in this situation – New Zealand’s version of the then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair’s ‘Cool Britannia’ appeal to voters in what amounted to public-private partnerships in the cultural sectors of the economy. This ‘third-way’ promise to revitalise a shared sense of nationhood while delivering economic growth through improving the creative industry’s capacity to <b>output</b> <b>marketable</b> culture was echoed in New Zealand. The story of how multinational media company CanWest (owners of Kiwi FM) came to be a partner with the Labour government in promoting New Zealand music demonstrates some of the key issues inherent in this approach. Importantly, these partnerships rely on personal connections and relationships as well as the growing interconnections and shifting power differentials created between governments and officials, businesses and the media. The Kiwi FM story shows that while partnering with businesses in order to achieve cultural-economic goals such as promoting and monetising a national music culture may seem logical and low-risk, business necessarily has a longer view beyond the election cycle, and will join into and construct these partnerships in order to gain commercial advantages first and foremost. This dissertation offers critical new insights into the policy making processes, the commercial decisions and the cultural arguments that were behind the experiment that was Kiwi FM. Ultimately, I argue that substantial deregulation of the media should be carefully considered, as belated attempts to influence the market to achieve government policy goals are unlikely to succeed in a highly commercial media environment driven by competitive pressures and empowered by significant potential influence over the electorate...|$|R
