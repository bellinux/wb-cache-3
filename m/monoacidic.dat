Structure shown below are proposed� H Alkaloid Formula Rl R 2 Angustoline C 2 'OH 1702 N 3 CH(OH) CH 3 H Angustine C 20 'H 1 SON 3 CH=CH 2 ! Angustidine Cl 9 H 1 SON 3 H CH 3 The major alkaloid, angustoline, is <b>monoacidic</b> and the hydrochloride-and the picr te sa ts have been prepared. - ii - The presence of a l-hydroxyethyl side chain shown by n. m. r. has been confir. med by acetylation to g ve an / acetate. Chemical correlation between angustoline and angustine has been achieved in two ways. Firstly, the former was converted to the latter 'by acidic catalysed dehydration � Secondly, an ustoline or its acetate on heating with collidine yielded dihydroangustine, also obtained from angustine by hydrogenation. Arguments are presented for the structures of the three alkaloids, based substantially on n. m. r. data (including long-range coupling and N. O. E. data) and biogenetic considerations. I i The three alkaloids are postulated to be derived biogenetically from vincoside, the fused pyridine ring being formed via opening of the iridoid glycoside ring by ammonia (or equivalent). tocabstractChemistryMasterMaster of Scienc...|$|E
