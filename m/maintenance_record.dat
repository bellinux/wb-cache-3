Although the Indian Navy considered the AEW Sea King, {{expected to be}} designated as Mk42D, it was judged to be too expensive, consequently, in 2003, the Russian Kamov Ka-31 was procured instead. The indigenous HAL Dhruv was the intended replacement for the Sea King in the ASW role, however, in 2000, it was deemed unsuited, as the Indian Navy were dissatisfied with the design's folding blade mechanism and by the Dhruv's <b>maintenance</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The inquiry was {{critical}} of the operator and the Department of Civil Aviation. In particular, it {{was critical}} of the operator's poor standards of maintenance of aircraft instruments. [...] For this reason, the inquiry recommended the operator's airline licence should be suspended or cancelled. [...] It also considered the Department should have made more checks of the operator's methods and record keeping. [...] The Minister declined {{to take action against}} the operator, saying its <b>maintenance</b> <b>record</b> keeping had improved significantly since the accident. [...] He also cited the hardship that would be inflicted on many remote communities in Western Australia if the operator's airline licence were to be suspended or cancelled. [...] The Minister said his Department would be extra vigilant towards the operator but conceded there were limits to what could be done without significant increases in staff numbers.|$|E

In spite of this, Real was able to grow by extending the service to Curitiba to Porto Alegre and opening flights to Londrina and São José do Rio Preto. Real opened many flights to new locations in precarious operating conditions. It had a bad <b>maintenance</b> <b>record</b> and crews were pressured to fly under adverse conditions. The results were many serious accidents.|$|E

50|$|Examination {{from the}} aircraft's <b>{{maintenance}}</b> <b>record</b> showed that maintenance crew had conducted a radiographic {{examination of the}} rear pressure bulkhead of the aircraft prior to the accident.

The technique used to examine this particular area (the rear pressure bulkhead) of the Vanguard has been demonstrated to be ineffective as a sure means of detecting corrosion. This is because of the difficulty of interpreting the photographic plate details resulting from the complex structure. With the inspection technique then in use, investigators concluded that the corrosion on the aircraft was not detectable.|$|E

In November 2000, the ownership of Atyrau Airways and Airport was transferred to Euro-Asia Air, a subsidiary of state petroleum company KazTransOil. On 13 July 2009, Atyrau Airways was included in the List of air carriers banned in the European Union, along with all other Kazakh airlines with the exception of Air Astana due to the poor <b>maintenance</b> <b>record</b> of the country. Shortly thereafter (in October), its airline license was revoked.|$|E

The Category 2 storm damaged 27 main transmission lines, several transmission towers, 117 distribution feeders, and 31 major electrical substations. More recently, the issue of the company's investment in the provincial grid has been raised at a leaders' debate during the 2009 election campaign. The company received praise from premier Darrell Dexter for its efforts in restoring power after the passage of Hurricane Earl in September 2010.|$|E
5000|$|East-West Airlines {{was founded}} in 1947 with funds raised from about 800 mainly small investors with the aim to [...] "fight the city based airline monopolies" [...] and traded {{forthwith}} as an unlisted public company. At this early time, the workforce consisted of the manager who was Basil Brown, and the maintenance engineer and workshop manager, who was Cedric Wood. Cedric Wood was an exceptional aircraft engineer, having an unblemished <b>maintenance</b> <b>record,</b> despite having nine separate aircraft maintenance licences to his name. Enabling the company to operate maintenance procedures on a 'shoe string' budget. Initially, using single-engine Tiger Moth aircraft, East-West established Australia's first regular mail delivery service between Tamworth NSW, Port Maquarie and Newcastle. The company bought twin-engine Avro Anson aircraft which allowed it to carry more mail and passengers.|$|E
5000|$|In Finnish Air Force service, the B-239s were {{regarded}} as being easy to fly, a [...] "gentleman's travelling plane." [...] The Buffalo was also popular within the FAF because of its relatively long range and also because of a good <b>maintenance</b> <b>record.</b> This was {{in part due to}} the efforts of the Finnish mechanics, who solved a problem that plagued the Wright Cyclone engine by inverting one of the piston rings in each cylinder, which had a positive effect on reliability. The cooler weather of Finland also helped, because the engine was prone to overheating as noted in tropical Pacific use. The Brewster Buffalo earned a reputation in Finnish Air Force service as one of their more successful fighter aircraft, with the Fiat G.50, that scored an unprecedented kill/loss ratio of 33/1.|$|E
