5|$|One-day {{track and}} field {{meetings}} form {{the most common and}} seasonal aspect of the sport – they are the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>level</b> of {{track and field}} competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to represent their club or institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.|$|E

Firstly, it has no handle and {{secondly}} it is weighted at both ends. These allow for more effective control over its movement. Even at the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>levels,</b> a meteor hammer is often seen as unpredictable and intimidating. The difficulty people have in following it makes it very effective in combat.|$|R

25|$|Perception (Level 1 SA): The {{first step}} in {{achieving}} SA is to perceive the status, attributes, and dynamics of relevant elements in the environment. Thus, Level 1 SA, the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>level</b> of SA, involves the processes of monitoring, cue detection, and simple recognition, which lead to an awareness of multiple situational elements (objects, events, people, systems, environmental factors) and their current states (locations, conditions, modes, actions).|$|E

40|$|Whether we are {{philosophers}} or {{are members}} of the general public, during the course of our daily activities we sub-divide our phenomenological world and form categorial accounts of these experiences. The development of categorial ontologies, or sub-divisions of the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>levels</b> of our existence, has long been used to enable a clearer understanding of a specific domain of interest. Similarly, ontological scholarship has a long and distinguished history which continues to this day (see for example: Aristotle and Ackrill, 1975; Simons, 1987; Harte, 2002; Sider, 2005; Lowe, 2007; Chisholm, 2010; Poli and Seibt, 2010).

50|$|Brewer's dual {{appointment}} afforded him {{the opportunity}} to {{take an active role in}} all levels of academic instruction, both inside and outside of the laboratory. Besides providing classroom instruction in solid-state chemistry, heterogeneous equilibria, and inorganic chemistry, Brewer also delivered lectures and supervised laboratory work for laboratory courses in freshman chemistry, advanced quantitative analysis, instrumental analysis, inorganic synthesis, inorganic reactions, and organic chemistry, as well as courses in chemical thermodynamics from the sophomore to graduate student level. In order to ensure a high standard of instruction at even the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>levels,</b> Brewer initiated a course for freshman-chemistry teaching assistants that reviewed principles and certified their ability to adequately fulfill their responsibilities.|$|R
25|$|The {{tricarboxylic acid}} (TCA) cycle – or citric acid cycle – is an {{important}} step in cellular respiration. In the TCA cycle, a six carbon sugar will be oxidized. This oxidation produces the CO2 and H2O from the sugar. Plants, fungi, animals and bacteria all use this cycle to convert organic compounds to energy. This is how the majority of soil respiration occurs at its <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>level.</b> Since the process relies on oxygen to occur, this is referred to as aerobic respiration.|$|E
25|$|At the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>level,</b> an {{employee}} is motivated {{to work in}} order to satisfy basic physiological needs for survival, such as having enough money to purchase food. The next level of need in the hierarchy is safety, which could be interpreted to mean adequate housing or living in a safe neighborhood. The next three levels in Maslow's theory relate to intellectual and psycho-emotional needs: love and belonging, esteem (which refers to competence and mastery), and finally the highest order need, self-actualization.|$|E
25|$|Through Takizaki he met {{and became}} close {{friends with the}} painter Mark Tobey, which led Horiuchi to re-examine his own {{approach}} to art. He became increasingly interested in collage, and began experimenting with the fusion of elements of traditional Japanese collage with more modern techniques, styles, and materials. At its <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>level,</b> he was combining 'Eastern' shikishi design with 'Western' abstract expressionism, but injecting it with a unique energy, perhaps born of Horiuchi's numerous personal ups and downs and dislocations. He gradually gained command of this new style and, in the late 1950s, his work became increasingly popular.|$|E

Tongan dance concepts of movement as interpretation and movement as beauty are briefly discussed and illustrated with motifs. The Tongan cultural preference for interpretation by allusion rather than statement is related to dance motifs. Six genres of Tongan dance, {{each of which has}} a different combination of structural elements, are discussed in terms of dance movement and three factors external to movement—music, the association of poetry, and the occasion of performance. Interrelations of 'living' dance genres (within which new dances are still created) with 'dead but extant' genres (dances that are performed but no longer created) are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Among AP's {{election}} pledges were a {{tax reduction}} consisting in {{the suppression of}} the wealth tax, exemption from the income tax (IRPF) for incomes lower than 750,000 yearly pesetas, deduction of any economic amount intended for productive investments and the setting of an upper limit to individual tax burden. It also proposed the political immunity of Administration officials against successive government changes and a partial privatization of the social security system so that only the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>levels</b> of attendance would be maintained generally, with other benefits depending on what users paid (but providing extensions for the person attending home in each family and to young people unable to find employment after completing their studies). Finally, it advocated for completing the integration of Spain into NATO, ensuring full employment and to guide the cultural policy under christian humanism.|$|R
25|$|At the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>level,</b> {{the best}} defense against floods is to seek higher ground for high-value uses while {{balancing}} the foreseeable risks with the benefits of occupying flood hazard zones. Critical community-safety facilities, such as hospitals, emergency-operations centers, and police, fire, and rescue services, should be built in areas least at risk of flooding. Structures, such as bridges, that must unavoidably be in flood hazard areas should be designed to withstand flooding. Areas most at risk for flooding could be put to valuable uses that could be abandoned temporarily as people retreat to safer areas when a flood is imminent.|$|E
25|$|The {{intensity}} of medical management {{is dependent on}} the severity of the colic, its cause, and the financial capabilities of the owner. At the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>level,</b> analgesia and sedation is administered to the horse. The most commonly used analgesics for colic pain in horses are NSAIDs, such as flunixin meglumine, although opioids such as butorphanol may be used if the pain is more severe. Butrophanol is often given with alpha-2 agonists such as xylazine and detomidine to prolong the analgesic effects of the opioid. Early colic signs may be masked with the use of NSAIDs, so some practitioners prefer to examine the horse before they are given by the owner.|$|E
25|$|Ricin is {{very toxic}} if inhaled, injected, or ingested. It {{can also be}} toxic if dust {{contacts}} the eyes {{or if it is}} absorbed through damaged skin. It acts as a toxin by inhibiting protein synthesis. It prevents cells from assembling various amino acids into proteins according to the messages it receives from messenger RNA in a process conducted by the cell's ribosome (the protein-making machinery)—that is, the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>level</b> of cell metabolism, essential to all living cells and thus to life itself. Ricin is resistant, but not impervious, to digestion by peptidases. By ingestion, the pathology of ricin is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, where it may cause mucosal injuries. With appropriate treatment, most patients will make a decent recovery.|$|E
40|$|Computer technologies, in general, and Internet technologies, in particular, {{have had}} a {{tremendous}} impact on all aspects of business over the last several years. One area of continued concern is the protection of intellectual properties within the boundaries of these computer-mediated environments, most notably copyrights. While the ability to share copyrighted information has always existed at the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>levels,</b> the advent of the information age has allowed the sharing of this information to take place in potentially greater quantities and without a loss of quality. As such, copying digital works creates a major threat to industries dealing in the production and distribution of copyrightable creations.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} paper, {{based on}} an Italian sample of 9960 fifteen-year-old students, is to {{identify}} those variables on which teachers could effectively intervene in contexts where students are very unlikely to attain even the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>levels</b> of competence in mathematics. We adopted a specific conceptual framework and a two-stage methodological procedure in order to discover the interplay between factors of disadvantage and to identify resilient students along with malleable variables associated with resilience. The results {{show that there is}} an interaction between the degree of development of a geographic region, the socio-economic and cultural background of schools and families, and the gender of students which can create great initial disadvantages for students. The resilience of students to such disadvantages is related to factors such as teaching strategies and academic self-efficacy which appear to be valid and modifiable also in local, school and family contexts with less resources...|$|R

25|$|Athletics {{competitions}} can be broadly {{divided into}} three types: international championships, national championships, and annual meetings and races. Athletics at international championships, or Games, represent the pinnacle of competition within the sport, and they are contested between athletes representing their country or region. The organisation of these competitions is usually overseen by either a world, continental, or regional athletics governing body. Athletes gain entry into these competitions by earning selection from their national athletics governing body, which is generally done by assessing athletes via their past achievements or performances at a national selection event. National championships are annual competitions endorsed by a national governing body which serve the purpose of deciding the country's best athlete in each event. Annual one-day meetings and races form the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>level</b> of competition and {{are the most common}} format of athletics contests. These events are often invitational and are organised by sports organisations, sports promoters, or other institutions.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of multimodality, at its <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>level,</b> {{can change the}} way an audience perceives information. The most basic understanding of language comes via semiotics – the association between words and symbols. A multimodal text changes its semiotic effect by placing words with preconceived meanings in a new context, whether that context is audio, visual, or digital. This in turn creates a new, foundationally different meaning for an audience. Bezemer and Kress, two scholars on multimodality and semiotics, argue that students understand information differently when text is delivered {{in conjunction with a}} secondary medium, such as image or sound, than when it is presented in alphanumeric format only. This is due to it drawing a viewer’s attention to “both the originating site and the site of recontextualization”. Meaning is moved from one medium to the next, which requires the audience to redefine their semiotic connections. Recontextualizing an original text within other mediums creates a different sense of understanding for the audience, and this new type of learning can be controlled by the types of media used.|$|E

50|$|He is {{exploring}} the 3rd dimension {{of human beings}} {{in relation to the}} spiritual Universe. There are five levels of movement in Geraldes works; EARTH, AIR, WATER, FIRE and SPIRIT. All of them relate {{back to the beginning of}} mankind. Luis follows a two-dimensional path to the inner self by stating in his works the two levels of AIR, and EARTH, which are the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>levels</b> of man's existence. He then proceeds to lay over the emotions, which men carry within themselves. He uses the blues and greens of water and the warm colours for fire creating a feeling of completeness or as an ordered whole. Superimposed on that, Geraldes states the mystical or esoteric forms from the past and present. By this last statement he puts men in a total form of relationship to the five signs of water, air, fire, earth and spirit. Geraldes is able to put down his innermost involvement in life.|$|R
40|$|In {{literature}} {{several studies}} have been performed to analyze the surface finish of rapid prototyped parts. These researches have been mainly aimed to the optimal build direction of prototypes to obtain the best possible surface finish on specific surfaces. Very diffuse technologies that suffers considerably of low surface quality are Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and extrusion based Rapid Prototyping machines in general. Hand finishing for even the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>levels</b> of part quality are often required by the customers, forcing the geometrical features of the prototypes {{to be controlled by}} the skill level of the operator.
