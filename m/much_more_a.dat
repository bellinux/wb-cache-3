At the end of that project, she and Dragon were to have {{embarked}} on a 25th anniversary tour; however, the stresses of the road proved too demanding and Captain & Tennille instead put an indefinite hold on their career as a performing duo. Nevertheless, Captain & Tennille's popularity remained evident in the release of their Ultimate Collection: The Complete Hits on Hip-O Records (a subsidiary of Universal Records) in 2001, and More Than Dancing... <b>Much</b> <b>More,</b> <b>a</b> 2002 compact disc. The latter contains what was originally their final album in 1982, More Than Dancing, which at that time was released only in Australia, and is combined with selected tracks from their 1995 20 Years of Romance, originally on K-Tel (re-recording of their songs, and cover versions of others), as well as five newly released tracks.|$|E
25|$|In Otello, {{the flow}} between the set pieces is much {{smoother}} {{than in any}} of Verdi's earlier works. Whereas in his earlier masterpieces he had made significant strides away from the aria-recitative structure, here Verdi did away with it entirely. Verdi's librettist, Arrigo Boito, was extremely faithful to Shakespeare's original play, though act 1 of the drama (everything {{having to do with}} Brabantio, Desdemona's father) was omitted and the other scenes were condensed in length. The roles of Otello (Othello) and Iago are among the most fully developed in all of opera, as much so as in Shakespeare's original drama—especially the character of Otello himself. (Iago is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> standard villain in the opera than in the play). Verdi's orchestral writing in Otello is more highly developed than in any of Verdi's previous masterpieces. Though the orchestra plays a significant role in his earlier works, never before had Verdi, or Italian opera in general, been so daring and complex in orchestration. Throughout the score instances of dissonance appear, and Otello's entrance is marked by a cluster chord made of C–C–D. It has been argued that Otello was influenced by Richard Wagner's work, whereas others believe it was pitted directly against it.|$|E

25|$|Pownoll's {{death was}} widely mourned, Pellew writing {{in his report}} to the Admiralty that: 'The loss of Captain Pownoll will be {{severely}} felt. The ship's company have lost a father. I have lost <b>much</b> <b>more,</b> <b>a</b> father and a friend united; and that friend my only one on earth. Never, my lord, was grief more poignant than that we all feel for an adored commander. Mine is inexpressible.' Admiral John Jervis wrote of {{him that he was}} ‘the best officer, & most excellent, kind hearted man in the Profession’, and claimed that he had ‘lost the best Partizan, if not the best officer under every line of description in the Service’. Edward Osler wrote in 1835 that 'St Vincent and Pownoll who were brought up under Boscawen, and received their Lieutenant's commission from him, contributed materially to form a Nelson or an Exmouth; each the founder of a school of officers, whose model is the character of their chief, and their example his successes.' As well as Pellew, John Borlase Warren served under Pownoll and {{went on to become a}} leading frigate captain, while Jervis remembered Pownoll's contribution to the navy in 1804, when he promoted Pownoll's grandson, John Bastard. Pellew named his eldest son Pownoll Bastard Pellew in honour of his former captain and his family.|$|E

500|$|With the {{emergence}} of feminist criticism in academia in the 1960s and 1970s, Wollstonecraft's works returned to prominence. Their fortunes reflected that of the second wave of the North American feminist movement itself; for example, in the early 1970s, six major biographies of Wollstonecraft were published that presented her [...] "passionate life in [...] to [...] radical and rationalist agenda". The feminist artwork The Dinner Party, first exhibited in 1979, features a place setting for Wollstonecraft. In the 1980s and 1990s, yet another image of Wollstonecraft emerged, one which described her as <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> creature of her time; scholars such as Claudia Johnson, Gary Kelly, and Virginia Sapiro demonstrated the continuity between Wollstonecraft's thought and other important eighteenth-century ideas regarding topics such as sensibility, economics, and political theory.|$|E

500|$|During the Bishops' Wars {{the king}} {{attempted}} to blockade Scotland, disrupting {{trade and the}} transport of returning troops from the continent. The king planned amphibious assaults from England {{on the east coast}} and from Ireland to the west, but they failed to materialise. Scottish privateers took English prizes and the Covenanters planned to fit out Dutch ships with Scottish and Dutch crews to join the naval war effort. After the Covenanters allied with the English Parliament they established two patrol squadrons for the Atlantic and North Sea coasts, known collectively as the [...] "Scotch Guard". These patrols guarded against Royalist attempts to move men, money and munitions and raids on Scottish shipping, particularly from ships based in Wexford and Dunkirk. They consisted mainly of small English warships, controlled by the Commissioners of the Navy based in London, but it always relied heavily on Scottish officers and revenues, and after 1646, the West Coast squadron became <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> Scottish force. The Scottish navy was unable to withstand the English fleet that accompanied the army led by Cromwell that conquered Scotland in 1649–51. The Scottish ships and crews were divided among the Commonwealth fleet.|$|E
500|$|Briggs was {{nominated}} {{to run for}} the governorship on the Whig ticket against the incumbent Democrat Marcus Morton in 1843. [...] Former Governor John Davis had been nominated first, but refused the nomination, possibly because Daniel Webster promised him party support for a future vice presidential bid. [...] Briggs was apparently recommended as a compromise candidate acceptable to different factions within the party (one controlled by Webster, the other by Abbott Lawrence). [...] He was also probably chosen to appeal more directly to the state's rural voters, a constituency that normally supported Morton. [...] The abolitionist Liberty Party also fielded a candidate, with the result that none of the candidates won the needed majority. [...] The legislature decided the election in those cases; with a Whig majority there, Briggs' election was assured. [...] Briggs was reelected annually until 1850 against a succession of Democratic opponents. [...] He won popular majorities until the 1849 election, even though third parties (including the Liberty Party and its successor, the Free Soil Party) were often involved. [...] Although Whigs had a reputation for aristocratic bearing, Briggs was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> man of the people than the preceding Whig governors, John Davis and Edward Everett.|$|E
500|$|Bell and Zbyszewski worked {{together}} on Morse and Hunter's storyline for the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., preparing them to move over to the spin-off, with Bell explaining that it would set up Most Wanted by defining exactly who the characters are, such as Hunter and his lack of loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. and to ideologies—"nothing specific about the show, it’s just who Hunter is." [...] Blood noted that Hunter is [...] "willing to ignore {{the rules and regulations}} to get the right thing done. Sometimes, Bobbi needs that kick up the backside to send her in that direction. By the same token, Hunter needs Bobbi's rationale sometimes to make sure he doesn't get in trouble again." [...] Bell added that for Hunter, [...] "laws are kind of suggestions, and if he’s with them he’ll follow them, and he’s always been <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> loyalist to the guy in the trenches than to any ideology". Palicki remarked that the differences in the character's views and beliefs would be [...] "a big through line throughout the entire show", and that having Morse and Hunter work for Fortune would test both of their morals, with Hunter having [...] "a bit more experience with that, where the line to cross is a bit fluid. It might take Bobbi a bit more to adapt to that." ...|$|E

New York Daily News named Grey's Anatomy a [...] "winner", whereas Newsday expressed a positive opinion by stating [...] "You simply can't stop watching." [...] The Washington Post Tom Shales was critical of season one, finding it reminiscent of ER and commenting that: [...] "The show is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> matter of commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different." [...] Shortly after its initial airing, the Chicago Tribune Maureen Ryan called Grey's Anatomy the new Friends; a concluded National Broadcasting Company (NBC) sitcom following the lives of a group of young adults, that all of its ten-year run in the top-five for viewer ratings. The second season received critical acclaim, top critics like Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called the show a [...] "phenomenon" [...] not just TV adding the show was, [...] "one of the best TV shows around", Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly later during the tenth season called the second [...] "the show’s best season to date" [...] however, Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures opined that Grey's Anatomy is a mere combination of Scrubs, ER, Sex and the City, and The Love Boat. It further garnered positive reviews, Christopher Monfette of IGN Entertainment added: [...] "The second season of this medical drama expertly wove its signature elements of complex relationships, whimsical banter and challenging life-lessons; all to a montage-fetish, indie-rock soundtrack." [...] Todd Gilchrist also from IGN called the season [...] "terrific" [...] adding, [...] "Indeed, one of the best currently on television. While {{it remains to be seen}} what the creators do with it, now that it's become an outright event program, the season demonstrates that Rhimes and co. know what to do with the opportunities presented them. whether you're male or female, this is the kind of entertainment that small-screen devotees and folks fed up with television need to see." ...|$|E

[...] Walter Chaw from Film Freak Central said the show was [...] "so odious, so repugnant, that it's impossible not to have predicted its newly-minted role as the most popular program in the land." [...] The Washington Posts Tom Shales was critical of the early series, finding it reminiscent of ER and commenting that: [...] "The show is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> matter of commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different". He called Rhimes' script for the pilot episode [...] "nothing but a casserole made of equal parts ham and corn", writing that overall: [...] "It's a 'new' show only {{in the sense that}} Dr. Frankenstein's monster was a new man." [...] Kate Aurthur for The New York Times deemed the show a hybrid of Ally McBeal, Sex and the City and ER, writing of the news that it had become the highest-rated midseason drama in 12 years that: [...] "When you parse its ratings, Grey's Anatomy underscores one of the real lessons of the current season - men will watch shows with a female lead. That goes against conventional wisdom, which dictates that it's easier to get women to watch shows aimed at men." [...] Review Stream gave positive reviews regarding the pilot episode, [...] "A Hard Day's Night", due to the undeniable chemistry between Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey from the series' first scene. Regarding Miranda Bailey's appearance in the pilot, ReviewStream.com stated [...] "She's such a small woman but wait until she speaks". HomeTheaterInfo.com, however, had a mixed perspectives on the pilot, noting that the storylines were similar to fellow ABC series Desperate Housewives, but also [...] "brilliantly written, extremely well acted and directed to near perfection". IGN gave a positive review stating, [...] "The show isn't derivative, and actually maintains a tenuous edge over its predecessor, the characters resemble real people - who are fragile, and yes, fallible." [...] and added, [...] "this facile description does little justice to the show's tightly-wound plotting, character subtleties, or masterful acting, it speaks to the intangible nature of what differentiates the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, in network television." ...|$|E

The case ended inconclusively after one of the judges died, but the legal teams reassembled for the case of Ware v. Hylton.
