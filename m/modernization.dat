Profitability is affected by benefits, risks, and costs. There exists multiple approaches for evaluating these issues, including strategy selection of legacy system evolution and <b>modernizations.</b> We shall provide a comparison of 12 well-known approaches. The sample includes 6 general approaches suitable for strategic-level decision support, 2 risk evaluation based approaches, and 4 approaches for cost estimation. The evaluation is organized based on NIMSAD meta framework for evaluating methodologies. Reliable estimation of (long-term strategic-level) benefits especially appears to be difficult.

40|$|Improving energy {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the three pillars of the European energy and climate targets for 2020 and has led to the introduction of several policy measures to promote {{energy efficiency}}. The paper analyzes the effectiveness of subsidies in increasing energy efficiency in residential dwellings. An empirical analysis is conducted in which the effectiveness of subsidies on the number of dwelling <b>modernizations</b> is investigated. Next, the impact of renovations on energy consumption is analyzed using a differences-indifferences-in-differences approach for <b>modernizations</b> made in given subsidy program periods, as well as for ownership status and household types for more than 5000 German households between 1992 and 2010. By controlling for socio-economic status, dwelling characteristics and macro-indicators, it becomes apparent that homeowners invest signi ficantly more and have significantly lower heating expenditures than their tenant counterparts. Thus, the landlord-tenant problem tends to broaden the energy efficiency gap. It is also found that the number of <b>modernizations</b> made by landlords does not increase with higher subsidies. However, the renovations made during the subsidy periods decrease the heating consumption of tenants. Given the conditions that homeowners already invest more in energy efficiency, they increase <b>modernizations</b> only slightly with increasing subsides. However, these <b>modernizations</b> during subsidy periods do not further decrease homeowners' energy consumption. Thus, the large part of the overall subsidies received by homeowners can be identified as windfall prots...|$|R

5|$|On 29 July 2013, Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno {{warned that}} the Ground Combat Vehicle program might be delayed or {{possibly}} even cancelled because of the sequestration budget cuts. Although he specifically said it could be delayed, he did {{not rule out the}} possibility of cancellation. The GCV was high-priority for the Army to give better protection than the M2 Bradley, but because of the sequester cuts everything was being considered. On 1 August 2013, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel outlined two basic results if the effects of sequestration continued: <b>modernization</b> programs like the GCV would be cut to maintain troop levels, or high-end capability efforts like the GCV would be preserved to continue <b>modernization</b> and keep equipment technologically advanced with troop levels being cut. Odierno was committed to balancing soldiers, readiness, and <b>modernization,</b> and was intent on the need for the Ground Combat Vehicle. Suggested alternative options, such as further upgrading the Bradley and buying currently available infantry fighting vehicles like the German Puma, were recommended as cost-saving measures. Army leaders said the Puma's low troop-carrying capacity would require buying five vehicles to replace every four Bradleys, and that upgrading the Bradley would essentially be engineering a new vehicle. While these options would offer no improvement over the fleet's current capability, not pursuing the GCV would allow the money to be spent elsewhere.|$|E
