5|$|After {{four years}} in Washington, he spent four years as Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), the number two position, at Embassy Moscow. These years {{cemented}} his reputation within the State Department as a Soviet expert. In early 1976, the State Department made public {{the fact that the}} Soviet Union had been beaming <b>microwaves</b> at the Moscow Embassy from a nearby building for many years. This caused concern about possible health effects of the low-level microwave radiation. Ironically, it was Soviet research that documented the psychological symptoms of sensitivity to microwave exposure. In the United States, the standards for safe exposure to <b>microwaves</b> were much more lenient than in the Soviet Union.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article {{discusses}} the fundamentals {{and benefits of}} <b>microwave</b> hybrid heating. High dielectric loss materials can be processed using direct <b>microwave</b> heating, whereas low dielectric loss materials can only be process using <b>microwave</b> through <b>microwave</b> hybrid heating.

5|$|Another popular {{method of}} growing {{synthetic}} diamond is {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD). The growth occurs under low pressure (below atmospheric pressure). It involves feeding a mixture of gases (typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen) into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma ignited by <b>microwaves,</b> hot filament, arc discharge, welding torch or laser. This method is mostly used for coatings, but can also produce single crystals several millimeters in size (see picture).|$|E
5|$|In the free-electron laser (FEL), a {{relativistic}} {{electron beam}} passes through a pair of undulators that contain arrays of dipole magnets whose fields point in alternating directions. The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that coherently interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the resonance frequency. FEL can emit a coherent high-brilliance electromagnetic radiation {{with a wide range}} of frequencies, from <b>microwaves</b> to soft X-rays. These devices are used in manufacturing, communication, and in medical applications, such as soft tissue surgery.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We propose an {{approach}} for {{the measurement of}} <b>microwave</b> frequency in the optical domain with adjustable mea-surement range and resolution. In the proposed approach, two optical wavelengths with a large wavelength spacing are modulated by an unknown <b>microwave</b> signal in a Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM). The optical output from the MZM is sent to a dispersive fiber to introduce different chromatic dispersions, leading to dif-ferent <b>microwave</b> power penalties. The two wavelengths are then separated, with the <b>microwave</b> powers measured by two photode-tectors. A fixed relationship between the <b>microwave</b> power ratio and the <b>microwave</b> frequency is established. The <b>microwave</b> fre-quency is estimated by measuring the two <b>microwave</b> powers. The frequency measurement range and resolution can be adjusted by tuning the wavelength spacing. Different frequency measurement ranges and resolutions are demonstrated experimentally.

40|$|High {{intensive}} <b>microwave</b> pretreatment is a {{new method}} to modify wood for the fabrication of wood-based nanocomposites. Based on the physical law on heat transfer, a mathematical model to describe the temperature profiles within wood heated by high intensive <b>microwave</b> was established and simulated in this research. The {{results showed that the}} temperature profiles within wood were related to <b>microwave</b> heating methods; The temperature inside wood firstly increased and then gradually decreased along the direction of <b>microwave</b> transmission when the unilateral <b>microwave</b> heating was applied, and the temperature difference along the thickness direction of wood was very significant; The temperature with wood firstly increased and then gradually decreased from the wood surface to interior when the bilateral <b>microwave</b> heating was applied. Compared with the unilateral <b>microwave</b> heating, bilateral <b>microwave</b> heating is a better <b>microwave</b> heating method for the more uniform wood <b>microwave</b> pretreatment...|$|R
5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of <b>microwaves</b> of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Rabi {{became a}} member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. That month, the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new {{technologies}} to the United States, including a cavity magnetron, a high-powered device that generates <b>microwaves</b> using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field. This device, which promised to revolutionize radar, demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee decided to establish a new laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop this radar technology. The name Radiation Laboratory was chosen as both unremarkable and a tribute to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Loomis recruited Lee DuBridge to run it.|$|E
5|$|In July 1933, Parsons became {{liaison officer}} between the Bureau of Ordnance and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, DC. At the NRL he was briefed {{by the head}} of its Radio Division, A. Hoyt Taylor, who told him about {{experiments}} that had been carried out into what the Navy would later name radar. Parsons immediately recognized the potential of the new invention to locate ships and aircraft, and perhaps even track shells in flight. For this, he realized {{that he was going to}} need high frequency <b>microwaves.</b> He discovered that no one had attempted this. The scientists had not considered all the applications of the technology, and the Navy bureaus had not grasped their potential. He was able to persuade the scientists to establish a group to investigate microwave radar, but without official sanction it had low priority. Parsons submitted a memorandum on the subject to the Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) requesting $5,000 per annum for research. To his dismay, the BuOrd and Bureau of Engineering, which was responsible for the NRL, turned his proposal down.|$|E
40|$|A {{magnetic}} {{tunnel junction}} (MTJ) -based <b>microwave</b> detector is proposed and investigated. When the MTJ is excited by <b>microwave</b> magnetic fields, the relative angle between the free layer and pinned layer alternates, {{giving rise to}} an average resistance change. By measuring the average resistance change, the MTJ can be utilized as a <b>microwave</b> power sensor. Due {{to the nature of}} ferromagnetic resonance, the frequency of an incident <b>microwave</b> is directly determined. In addition, by integrating a mixer circuit, the MTJ-based <b>microwave</b> detector can also determine the relative phase between two <b>microwave</b> signals. Thus, the MTJbased <b>microwave</b> detector can be used as an on-chip <b>microwave</b> phase and spectrum analyzer...|$|R
