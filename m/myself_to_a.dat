2500|$|According to Tarantino, {{the most}} {{difficult}} part of making the film was [...] "trying to take <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> different place as a filmmaker and throw my hat in the ring with other great action directors", as opposed to the dialogue scenes he was known for. The House of Blue Leaves sequence, in which the Bride battles dozens of yakuza soldiers, took eight weeks to film, six weeks over schedule. Tarantino wanted to create [...] "one of the greatest, most exciting sequences in the history of cinema". The crew eschewed computer generated imagery in favor of traditional practical effects used in 1970s Chinese cinema, particularly by director Chang Cheh, including the use of fire extinguishers and condoms to create spurts and explosions of blood. Tarantino told his crew: [...] "Let's pretend we're little kids and we're making a Super 8 movie in our back yard, and you don't have all this shit. How would you achieve this effect? Ingenuity is important here!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In his {{acceptance}} speech, Roosevelt declared, [...] "I pledge you, I pledge <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new {{deal for the}} American people... This {{is more than a}} political campaign. It is a call to arms." [...] Roosevelt promised securities regulation, tariff reduction, farm relief, government-funded public works, and other government actions to address the Great Depression. Reflecting changing public opinion, the Democratic platform included a call for the repeal of Prohibition; Roosevelt himself had not taken a public stand on the issue prior to the convention but promised to uphold the party platform. After the convention, Roosevelt won endorsements from several progressive Republicans, including George W. Norris, Hiram Johnson, and Robert La Follette Jr. He also reconciled with the party's conservative wing, and even Al Smith was persuaded to support the Democratic ticket. Hoover's handling of the Bonus Army further damaged the incumbent's popularity, as newspapers across the country criticized the use of force to disperse assembled veterans.|$|E

2500|$|Hatton fought Manny Pacquiao on 2 May 2009 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The {{fight was}} at light welterweight, {{which was the}} sixth weight {{category}} Pacquiao has fought at and is the weight at which Hatton was previously undefeated. Pacquiao defeated Hatton {{in the second round}} by a KO victory after knocking Hatton down twice in the first round. Following the loss to Pacquiao, Hatton put his career on hiatus. After more than a year out of action, in a June 2010 interview with Gulfnews.com, the British boxer seemed uninterested in coming to the ring again. He stated: [...] "Boxing started off as a habit and it ended up giving me some money and making me {{a little bit of a}} better person. But I don't think I will have a fight again. But you can never say never as I have not announced officially that I won't be boxing. At the moment I don't have any fire in the belly for a fight or to get <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gym." [...] However, Hatton also added: [...] "But it has been only 13 months and I am only 31, so never count me out." ...|$|E
