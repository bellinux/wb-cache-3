5|$|The {{blue whale}} rose from {{relative}} obscurity in the 1970s, {{after the release}} of the Songs of the Humpback Whale. The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not well known to <b>most</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{depends on}} the underlying cause and whether any complications occur. Rhabdomyolysis complicated by acute kidney impairment in patients with traumatic injury may have a mortality rate of 20%. Admission to {{the intensive care unit}} is associated with a mortality of 22% in the absence of acute kidney injury, and 59% if kidney impairment occurs. <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have sustained kidney impairment due to rhabdomyolysis fully recover their kidney function.|$|E
5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E

5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> develop SCSFLS {{feel the}} sudden onset of a severe and acute {{headache}}. It is a headache usually {{made worse by}} standing, typically becoming prominent throughout the day, with the pain becoming less severe when lying down. Orthostatic headaches can become chronic and disabling {{to the point of}} incapacitation. Some patients with SCSFLS will develop headaches that begin in the afternoon. This is known as second-half-of-the-day headache. This may be an initial presentation of a spontaneous CSF leak or appear after treatment such as an epidural patch, and likely indicates a slow CSF leak.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> stay at Glastonbury Festival camp in a tent. There are {{different}} camping areas, {{each with its}} own atmosphere. Limekilns and Hitchin Hill Ground are quieter camping areas, whereas Pennard Hill Ground is a lively campsite. Cockmill Meadow is a family campsite and Wicket Ground was introduced in 2011 as a second family-only campsite. A disabled campsite is also available in Spring Ground. Campsite accommodation is provided in the cost of a standard entry ticket but festival-goers must bring their own tents. Tipis have been at the festival for many years. A limited number of fixed tipis are available for hire at the tipi field near the stone circle. Up to six adults can stay in each tipi and each one comes with a groundsheet and raincatcher. Internal bedding and camping equipment is not provided. Tipi Park also offers solar showers and a log-fired yurt sauna to cap off the experience.|$|E

25|$|<b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are {{infected}} with {{only a small number}} of worms have no symptoms.

25|$|Malignant {{hyperthermia}} (MH) {{is a type}} {{of severe}} reaction that occurs to particular medications used during general anesthesia, among those who are susceptible. Symptoms include muscle rigidity, high fever, and a fast heart rate.

25|$|The exam {{is offered}} 25 {{or more times}} per year at Prometric centers. The number of administrations may vary each year. <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> take the MCAT are {{undergraduates}} in their junior or senior year of college before they apply to medical school. Ever since the exam's duration was lengthened to 7.5 hours, the test is only offered in the morning.|$|E
25|$|But {{the real}} {{breakthrough}} of that period, according to archaeologist Giovanni Lilliu, was the political organization which {{revolved around the}} parliament of the village, composed by the heads and the <b>most</b> influential <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> gathered to discuss the most important issues.|$|R

25|$|When {{tying the}} half-knots, a right-over-left half-knot {{followed}} by a left-over-right half-knot (or vice versa) forms a square or reef knot, a fairly effective knot {{for the purpose of}} tying shoelaces. However, tying two consecutive right-over-left half-knots (or two consecutive left-over-right half-knots) forms the infamous granny knot, which is much less secure. <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> use it will find themselves regularly retying their shoelaces.|$|E
25|$|It {{may also}} be noted {{historically}} that while Byzantine officials and chroniclers were disconcerted by the ambiguities among the different dating and recording systems in the earlier centuries, these mattered little to <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> marked time by the orderly progression of agricultural seasons and church festivals, and by the regularity of holidays, weather cycles, and years that revealed the Divine order (Taxis) underlying the world.|$|E
25|$|<b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{have taken}} {{too much of}} a calcium channel blocker, {{especially}} diltiazem, get slow heart rate and low blood pressure. This can progress to the heart stopping altogether. CCBs of the dihydropyridine group, as well as flunarizine, predominantly cause reflex tachycardia as a reaction to the low blood pressure. For verapamil, despite it having a similar mechanism of action as diltiazem, both fast and slow heart rhythm are described.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the causes}} of PKU were understood, PKU caused severe {{disability}} in <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> inherited the relevant mutations. Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winning author Pearl S. Buck had a daughter named Carol who lived with PKU before treatment was available, and wrote a moving account of its effects in a book called The Child Who Never Grew. Many untreated PKU patients born before widespread newborn screening are still alive, largely in dependent living homes/institutions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have {{experienced}} a traumatic event will not develop PTSD. People who experience interpersonal trauma (for example rape or child abuse) {{are more likely to}} develop PTSD, as compared to people who experience non-assault based trauma such as accidents and natural disasters. About half of people develop PTSD following rape. Children are less likely than adults to develop PTSD after trauma, especially if they are under ten years of age. Diagnosis is based on the presence of specific symptoms following a traumatic event.|$|E
25|$|<b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are {{infected}} have no or few symptoms. Otherwise {{the most common}} {{signs and symptoms of}} Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever. The time from a mosquito bite to developing symptoms is not yet known, but is probably a few days to a week. The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that people do not {{have to go to a}} hospital.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fears of}} {{enclosed}} spaces is an irrational fear. <b>Most</b> claustrophobic <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{find themselves in}} a room without windows consciously know that they aren't in danger, yet these same people will be afraid, possibly terrified to the point of incapacitation, and many do not know why.|$|R
