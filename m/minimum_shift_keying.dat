A novel {{method of}} <b>minimum</b> {{frequency}} <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (MSK) which based on {{digital signal processing}} (DSP) and complex bandpass processing is proposed in the article. According to the bit value of the input data, the MSK complex bandpass signal is directly produced and then is complex bandpass filtered, the real part of the complex bandpass signal is fetched to achieve the MSK modulation. The receiving signal of MSK is sampled, and then complex bandpass filtered to attain the complex bandpass signal.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the performances of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and <b>minimum</b> frequency <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (MSK) modulations as potential future global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signal modulation schemes.
