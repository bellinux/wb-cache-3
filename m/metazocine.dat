5000|$|<b>Metazocine</b> is an opioid {{analgesic}} related to pentazocine. While <b>metazocine</b> has significant analgesic effects, mediated through a mixed agonist-antagonist {{action at the}} mu opioid receptor, its clinical use is limited by dysphoric and hallucinogenic effects which are most likely caused by activity at kappa opioid receptors (where it is a high-efficacy agonist) and/or sigma receptors.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Metazocine</b> is in Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act 1970 of the United States as a Narcotic with ACSCN 9240 with a 19 gram {{aggregate}} manufacturing quota as of 2014. The {{free base}} conversion ratio for salts includes 0.81 for the hydrochloride and 0.74 for the hydrobromide. [...] It is listed under the Single Convention for the Control of Narcotic Substances 1961 and is controlled {{in most countries}} {{in the same fashion}} as is morphine.|$|E
50|$|The {{prototype}} benzomorphan, <b>metazocine</b> (6), can {{be obtained}} from a variation of the morphinan synthesis.Thus, reaction of the Grignard reagent from p-methoxybenzyl chloride (1) with the lutidine methiodide (2) affords the benzylated dihydropyridine (3). Reduction of the enamine π-bond leads to the tetrahydropyridine (4). Cyclization by means of acid leads directly to the benzomorphan ring system (5). Demethylation of the aromatic ring system affords the phenol. Although this last compound is in fact a relatively potent analgesic, it is not available commercially as a drug.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{describe}} the activity of a set of opioid drugs, including partial agonists, in a cell system expressing only mu opioid receptors. Receptor activation was assessed by measuring the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic adenosine mono phosphate (cAMP) production. Efficacies and potencies of these ligands were determined relative to the endogenous ligand β-endorphin and the common mu agonist, morphine. Results Among the ligands studied naltrexone, WIN 44, 441 and SKF 10047, were classified as antagonists, while the remaining ligands were agonists. Agonist efficacy was assessed by determining the extent of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. The rank order of efficacy of the agonists was fentanyl = hydromorphone = β-endorphin > etorphine = lofentanil = butorphanol = morphine = nalbuphine = nalorphine > cyclazocine = dezocine = <b>metazocine</b> ≥ xorphanol. The rank order of potency of these ligands was different from that of their efficacies; etorphine > hydromorphone > dezocine > xorphanol = nalorphine = butorphanol = lofentanil > <b>metazocine</b> > nalbuphine > cyclazocine > fentanyl > morphine >>>> β-endorphin. Conclusion These results elucidate the relative activities of a set of opioid ligands at mu opioid receptor and can serve as the initial step in a systematic study leading to understanding of the mode of action of opioid ligands at this receptor. Furthermore, these results can assist in understanding the physiological effect of many opioid ligands acting through mu opioid receptors. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} the activation profiles of 15 opioid ligands in transfected human embryonic kidney cells expressing only δ opioid receptors. Activation profiles of most of these ligands at δ opioid receptors had not been previously characterized in vitro. Receptor activation was assessed by measuring the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. Results Naltrexone and nalorphine were classified as antagonists at δ opioid receptor. The other ligands studied were agonists at δ opioid receptors and demonstrated IC 50 values of 0. 1 nM to 2 μM, maximal inhibition of 39 – 77 % and receptor binding affinities of 0. 5 to 243 nM. The rank order of efficacy of the ligands tested was <b>metazocine</b> = xorphanol ≥ fentanyl = SKF 10047 = etorphine = hydromorphone = butorphanol = lofentanil > WIN 44, 441 = Nalbuphine = cyclazocine ≥ met-enkephalin >> morphine = dezocine. For the first time these data describe and compare the function and relative efficacy of several ligands at δ opioid receptors. Conclusions The data produced from this study can lead to elucidation of the complete activation profiles of several opioid ligands, leading to clarification of the mechanisms involved in physiological effects of these ligands at δ opioid receptors. Furthermore, these data can be used as a basis for novel use of existing opioid ligands based on their pharmacology at δ opioid receptors. </p...|$|E
