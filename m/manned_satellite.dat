5000|$|Curtis Morgan was a {{high-ranking}} {{general in the}} United States Army and Air Force. Shortly after the First Invasion ended and the Visitors were driven from the Earth by the Red Dust, Morgan was among the few military leaders that remained uncorrupted by Visitor conversion, and was promoted by the president himself to become Supreme Commander of the entire U.S. military. Morgan helped reconstruct the country and oversaw security matters in all major cities, normally coordinating with Resistance groups when troop divisions were spread thin. General Morgan then ordered {{the development of an}} early warning system for a possible Visitor incursion, which took shape in the form of [...] "Vanguard One", a <b>manned</b> <b>satellite</b> installation placed in orbit for such a purpose. He also formulated a plan, [...] "Code Delta" [...] with Nathan Bates, where a series of storage tanks rigged to explode on a single command would release the entire remaining supply of the Red Dust drug to wipe out invading Visitor armies. One year after Liberation Day, when Diana escaped the Earth to the returning Visitor Fleet, Mike Donovan and Julie Parrish went to General Morgan and tried to convince him that the Visitors were about to launch an attack, but he didn't believe them and assured them that [...] "Vanguard One" [...] would have detected such a force. But while in communication with [...] "Vanguard One"'s commander (who also believes all is well), [...] "Vanguard One" [...] is completely destroyed by a Visitor attack force, who were hiding behind Earth's Moon to escape detection. General Morgan placed the entire nation's military and police armies on full alert and mobilized them to meet any Visitor ground troops. Just before the battle began, General Morgan prepared [...] "Code Delta" [...] for deployment with Bates, who cancelled it at the last second, saying that it should only be used as a last resort and claimed [...] "they still didn't know what they have and should only use it if we have to". Morgan reluctantly agreed and led his troops into battle against the landing Visitor armies and defended the major cities; and was soon overwhelmed by the Visitors' advanced technology and vast numbers, and was astounded when the Visitors weren't dying in Red Dust-protected areas below the frost temperature line. Morgan went to Bates again, insisting that more of the Red Dust be shipped to areas confirmed to be no longer protected. Bates said it was impossible and showed him the file of Red Dust research (which included photographs of plant and animal life subjected to heavy Red Dust exposure, leading to mutation, sterility and death) and explained the hazards of usage of the Red Dust and that it couldn't be used again for fear of destroying all life on Earth. When Morgan learned that {{at least half of the}} world was still protected by the Red Dust and, with governments collapsing and civil order breaking down, Morgan made an extremely painful decision; withdraw all armed forces from areas no longer protected by the Red Dust and redeploy them along the borders of the areas that are protected; forming [...] "The Free Zones", areas of the world that are still toxic to Visitor habitation. The Visitors couldn't breach their lines due to the Dust and order was partially restored. Morgan attended the peace treaty summit held by Bates, who had since formed a provisional government that controlled what's left of the civil and police forces in the un-protected areas and forced the Visitors to agree to let Los Angeles become an Open City. Morgan went on to oversee all security for the population and defense of [...] "The Free Zones", one day planning to drive the Visitors from the Earth.|$|E

40|$|During the {{re-entry}} {{phase of}} a <b>manned</b> <b>satellite,</b> some equipment for continuous on-board indication of position will be required. Since radio and radar may be useless during part of the re-entry, inertial guidance equipment may be required. Such equipment, however, has an inherent instability in the computation of altitude.

Further, the position indication error caused by accelerometer uncertainties can be reduced by switching off the accelerometers until their output becomes significantly greater than their uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Coverage of approximately {{one-third of the}} test site had been received by January 31, 1973 {{and all of the}} images received were MSS products. Images recorded during the first two months of the ERTS- 1 mission were of poor quality, owing largely to high ground reflectance. Later images were of better quality and MSS bands 5 and 7 have proven to be particularly useful. Features noted during visual inspection of 9 1 / 2 x 9 1 / 2 prints include major structural forms, vegetation patterns, drainage patterns, and outcrops of geologic formations having marked color contrasts. The Border Hills Structural Zone and the Y-O Structural Zone are prominently reflected in coverage of the Pecos Valley. A study of available maps and remote sensing material covering the Deming-Columbus area indicated that the limit of detection and the resolution of MSS products are not as good as those of aerial photographs, geologic maps, and <b>manned</b> <b>satellite</b> photographs.

40|$|The {{origins of}} the lifting-body idea are {{traced back to the}} mid- 1950 's, when the concept of a <b>manned</b> <b>satellite</b> reentering the Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{in the form of a}} wingless lifting body was first proposed. The advantages of low reentry deceleration loads, range capability, and horizontal landing of a lifting reentry vehicle (as compared with the high deceleration loads and parachute landing of a capsule) are presented. The evolution of the hypersonic HL- 10 lifting body is reviewed from the theoretical design and development process to its selection as one of two low-speed flight vehicles for fabrication and piloted flight testing. The design, development, and flight testing of the low-speed, air-launched, rocket-powered HL- 10 was part of an unprecedented NASA and contractor effort. NASA Langley Research Center conceived and developed the vehicle shape and conducted numerous theoretical, experimental, and wind-tunnel studies. NASA Flight Research Center (now NASA Dryden Flight Research Center) was responsible for final low-speed (Mach numbers less than 2. 0) aerodynamic analysis, piloted simulation, control law development, and flight tests. The prime contractor, Northrop Corp., was responsible for hardware design, fabrication, and integration. Interesting and unusual events in the flight testing are presented with a review of significant problems encountered in the first flight and how they were solved. Impressions by the pilots who flew the HL- 10 are included. The HL- 10 completed a successful 37 -flight program, achieved the highest Mach number and altitude of this class vehicle, and contributed to the technology base used to develop the space shuttle and future generations of lifting bodies...|$|E

40|$|A {{concept for}} a <b>manned</b> <b>satellite</b> reentry from a near space orbit and a glide landing {{on a normal}} size {{airfield}} is presented. The reentry vehicle configuration suitable for this concept would employ a variable geometry feature in order that the reentry could be made at 90 deg. angle of attack and the landing could be made with a conventional glide approach. Calculated results for reentry at a flight-path angle of - 1 deg. show that with an accuracy of 1 percent in the impulse of a retrorocket, the desired flight-path angle at reentry can be controlled within 0. 02 deg. and the distance traveled to the reentry point, within 100 miles. The reentry point is arbitrarily defined as {{the point at which}} the satellite passes through an altitude of about 70 miles. Misalignment of the retrorocket by 10 deg. increased these errors by as much as 0. 02 deg. and 500 miles. Intra-atmospheric trajectory calculations show that pure drag reentries starting with flight-path angles of - 1 deg. or less produce a peak deceleration of 8 g. Lift created by varying the angle of attack between 90 and 60 deg. is effective in decreasing the maximum deceleration and allows the range to the "recovery" point (where transition is made from reentry to gliding flight) to be increased by as much as 2, 300 miles. A sideslip angle of 30 deg. allows lateral displacement of the flight path by as much as 60 deg. miles. Reaction controls would provide control-attitude alignment during the orbit phase. For the reentry phase this configuration should have low static longitudinal and roll stability in the 90 deg. angle-of-attack attitude. Control could be effected by leading-edge and trailing-edge flaps. Transition into the landing phase would be accomplished at an altitude of about 100, 000 feet by unfolding the outer wing panels and pitching over to low angles of attack. Calculations indicate that glides can be made from the recovery point to airfields at ranges of from 150 to 200 miles, depending upon the orientation with respect to the original course...|$|E

40|$|The nearby space {{surrounding}} the Earth is densely populated by artificial satellites and instruments, whose orbits are distributed within the Low-Earth-Orbit region (LEO), ranging between 90 and 2 000 $km$ of altitude. As {{a consequence of}} collisions and fragmentations, many space debris of different sizes are left in the LEO region. Given the threat raised by the possible damages which a collision of debris can provoke with operational or <b>manned</b> <b>satellites,</b> the study of their dynamics is nowadays mandatory. This work {{is focused on the}} existence of equilibria and the dynamics of resonances in LEO. We base our results on a simplified model which includes the geopotential and the atmospheric drag. Using such model, we make a qualitative study of the resonances and the equilibrium positions, including their location and stability. The dissipative effect due to the atmosphere provokes a tidal decay, but we give examples of different behaviors, precisely a straightforward passage through the resonance or rather a temporary capture. We also investigate the effect of the solar cycle which is responsible of fluctuations of the atmospheric density and we analyze the influence of Sun and Moon on LEO objects.
