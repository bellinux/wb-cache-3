500|$|Fleming wrote Diamonds Are Forever at his Goldeneye {{estate in}} Jamaica in January and February 1955. He {{followed}} his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine, {{in which he}} said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the <b>morning...</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] On completion Fleming wrote to his friend Hilary Bray: ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1963 Fleming wrote a {{piece for}} Books and Bookmen {{magazine}} in which he described his approach to writing Bond books: [...] "I write for about three hours in the <b>morning...</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] Benson identified what he described as the [...] "Fleming Sweep", the use of [...] "hooks" [...] at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. The hooks combine with what Anthony Burgess calls [...] "a heightened journalistic style" [...] to produce [...] "a speed of narrative, which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery".|$|E
500|$|Fleming had {{previously}} mentioned to friends {{that he wanted}} to write a spy novel, {{but it was not until}} early 1952, to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials, that he began to write Casino Royale at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica on 17 February; he typed out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination, and finished work on the manuscript in March 1952. It was a pattern he retained for future Bond books. In May 1963 he wrote a piece for Books and Bookmen magazine in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the <b>morning...</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." ...|$|E

6000|$|Are you, by any chance, ever near Kensington Gardens about [...] twelve o'clock? I walk there most <b>mornings,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> should [...] feel so {{much happier}} if I could have just {{a word with you}} [...] about this.|$|R

500|$|The film is set {{one year}} after the events of The Avengers. Evans briefly makes a cameo {{appearance}} in the film as Captain America when Loki shapeshifts into him while mocking Thor. Hiddleston wore the Captain America costume while standing in for Evans, before Evans came to shoot the scene. Hiddleston said, [...] "I did an impression of Loki in the Captain America costume, and then they showed Chris [...] my performance on tape. It's him doing an impression of me doing an impression of him. And it's brilliant." [...] James Gunn, the director of Guardians of the Galaxy, directed the mid-credits scene which featured the Collector, played by Benicio del Toro. Asked about shooting the scene, Gunn said, [...] "I got the script that <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> did it in two hours {{at the end of a}} day of second unit shooting [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Killen {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} for the Brittens after creating and developing Lone Star for the Fox network. NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> remember I was so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox.|$|E
500|$|Once Fleming and {{his wife}} arrived at Goldeneye, he started work on the second Bond novel. In May 1963 he wrote an article for Books and Bookmen {{magazine}} describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the <b>morning...</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] As he had done with Casino Royale, Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend, the writer William Plomer, who reacted favourably to the story, telling Fleming that [...] "the new book held this reader like a limpet mine & the denouement was shattering". On a trip to the US in May 1953 Fleming used his five-day travelling time on RMS Queen Elizabeth to correct the proofs of the novel.|$|E

500|$|In June 1956 {{the author}} Ian Fleming began a {{collaboration}} with the producer Henry Morgenthau III on a planned television series, Commander Jamaica, which was to feature the Caribbean-based character James Gunn. [...] When the project foundered, and Fleming could not fashion a new plot for his next Bond novel, he used the idea {{as the basis for}} Dr. No. By January 1957 he had published four Bond novels in successive years from 1953—Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, Moonraker and Diamonds Are Forever. A fifth, From Russia, with Love, was being edited and prepared for production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write Dr. No. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: [...] "I write for about three hours in the <b>morning...</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] By the time he returned to London in late February, he had completed a 206-page first draft, which he initially titled The Wound Man.|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} after the forfeit, Rainmen guard Joey Haywood recounted that the team had been {{approached}} by an unknown man at their hotel following the brawl. Haywood said, [...] "He was pacing around the lobby on his phone eyeing us. He {{then went to the}} ATM but didn't actually do anything. He went and sat in a parked car out front. We thought something was going to go down, like he was scouting us out." [...] The Rainmen promptly left on the team bus, and it was considered a motive for forfeiting the game. On the morning of May 2, two days after the brawl, Rainmen guard Forrest Fisher wrote on Twitter that he had been kicked out of his apartment without warning. He said, [...] "We were in Toronto Friday <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> get a message from the landlord at the apartment I stay at, telling me that my bags have been packed and all of my stuff has been moved to storage." [...] The team management, who were responsible for players' living arrangements, were largely blamed for the affair. The players also claimed that they had not been paid in more than two weeks.|$|E
500|$|In January 1954 Fleming and his wife, Ann, {{travelled}} {{to their}} Goldeneye estate in Jamaica for their annual two-month holiday. He had already written two Bond novels, Casino Royale, {{which had been}} published in April 1953, and Live and Let Die, whose publication was imminent. He began writing Moonraker on his arrival in the Caribbean. He later wrote an article for Books and Bookmen magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the <b>morning...</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] By 24 February he had written over 30,000 words, although he wrote to a friend that he felt like he was already parodying the two earlier Bond novels. Fleming's own copy bears the following inscription, [...] "This was written in January and February 1954 and published a year later. It is based on a film script I have had in my mind for many years." [...] He later said that the idea for the film had been too short for a full novel, and that he [...] "had to more or less graft {{the first half of the}} book onto my film idea in order to bring it up to the necessary length".|$|E
6000|$|... "Too much 'Romance of the Forest'?" [...] I suggested, recalling {{my little}} {{friend of the}} <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> what <b>I</b> was sure had been her {{favourite}} reading--Mrs. Radcliffe's novels.|$|R

500|$|By January 1956 {{the author}} Ian Fleming had {{published}} three novels—Casino Royale in 1953, Live and Let Die in 1954 and Moonraker in 1955. A fourth, Diamonds Are Forever, was being edited {{and prepared for}} production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write From Russia, with Love. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: [...] "I write for about three hours in the <b>morning...</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] He returned to London in March that year with a 228-page first-draft manuscript that he subsequently altered more heavily than any of his other works. One of the significant re-writes changed Bond's fate; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books and wrote to his friend, the American author Raymond Chandler: [...] "My muse is in a very bad way... I am getting fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks." [...] Fleming re-wrote {{the end of the novel}} in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond, which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted. Fleming's first draft ended with Bond and Romanova enjoying a romance. By January 1957 Fleming had decided he would write another story, and began work on Dr. No in which Bond recovers from his poisoning and is sent to Jamaica.|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, Hudson said: [...] "Meditation {{has been}} the most helpful and life-changing thing for me. You can feel the {{difference}} when you meditate on a regular basis. At least I can.... I started practicing transcendental meditation {{a year and a half}} ago so I meditate 20 minutes in the <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> try to do another 20 minutes in the afternoon." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{coaches were}} calling the house, telling my dad to ‘talk to her.’ And {{part of it}} was the drugs, {{part of it was}} I'd done it so long. And I wanted to be a teenager.

2500|$|Sulley, {{when asked}} (in 2004) {{to pick the}} {{highlight}} of her career, said: [...] "I think it's still happening. I think the fact we're still doing it now. After all these years – I'm 41 now, and really, I shouldn't be in a pop group any more, but I am and it's still my job! I {{wake up in the}} <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> haven't got to go to a nine-to-five. I've got this life and I'm very, very lucky! ...|$|E
2500|$|A true {{indication}} of how successful the Beatles became thanks to [...] "From Me to You" [...] (though it would soon be overshadowed by [...] "She Loves You" [...] and [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand") was expressed by McCartney: [...] "The first time I thought we'd really made it, was when I was lying in bed one <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> heard a milkman whistling 'From Me to You'. Actually, I'm sure that I once heard a bird whistling it as well. I swear I did!" ...|$|E
2500|$|John Williams {{composed}} {{and conducted}} the film's musical score, the second score composed {{the same year}} by Williams for Spielberg after The Adventures of Tintin. [...] Williams took inspiration by visiting a horse farm in California and observing horses and their behavior, elaborating that [...] "I got {{in the habit of}} watching the horses in the <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> began to see how they connect to each other and how they became curious about me. That's when I really began to get the sense that horses are very special creatures. They have been magnificent and trusted friends {{for such a long time}} and have done so much for us with such grace." [...] Williams was also influenced by the geographic scope of the film's story. In regards to that approach, Williams stated; [...] "This was a very rich opportunity musically because it is both about humans and animals and it takes place in three different countries. It starts out in a more intimate way, on the farm with the bonding of Joey and Albert. Then, the eruption of war changes the scale, and the music does a 180-degree turn. From this bucolic, gentle, even sentimental music, you move into the music of battle surges and gripping struggles. It's a musical journey full of dimension and emotional content, and I tried also to create an atmosphere reflective of that period, which was lyrical, poetic and tragic." [...] The score was recorded by a 90-piece orchestra, with Williams comparing the recording sessions more to a concert piece rather than a traditional film score, as it relied more on the individual performance of the musicians.|$|E

2500|$|Powell {{donated the}} maximum {{allowable}} amount to John McCain's {{campaign in the}} summer of 2007 and in early 2008, his name was listed as a possible running mate for Republican nominee McCain's bid during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, on October 19, 2008, Powell announced his endorsement of Barack Obama during a Meet the Press interview, citing [...] "his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities", in addition to his [...] "style and substance." [...] He additionally referred to Obama as a [...] "transformational figure". Powell further questioned McCain's judgment in appointing Sarah Palin as the vice presidential candidate, stating that {{despite the fact that she}} is admired, [...] "now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks, I don't believe she's ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice president." [...] He said that Obama's choice for vice-president, Joe Biden, was ready to be president. He also added that he was [...] "troubled" [...] by the [...] "false intimations that Obama was Muslim." [...] Powell stated that [...] " [...] is a Christian—he's always been a Christian... But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America." [...] Powell then mentioned Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan, a Muslim American soldier in the U.S. Army who served and died in the Iraq War. He later stated, [...] "Over the last seven weeks, the approach of the Republican Party has become narrower and narrower [...] I look at these kind of approaches to the campaign, and they trouble me." [...] Powell concluded his Sunday morning talk show comments, [...] "It isn't easy for me to disappoint Sen. McCain in the way that I have this <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> regret that [...] I think we need a transformational figure. I think we need a president who is a generational change and that's why I'm supporting Barack Obama, not out of any lack of respect or admiration for Sen. John McCain." [...] Later in a December 12, 2008, CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, Powell reiterated his belief that during the last few months of the campaign, Palin pushed the Republican party further to the right and had a polarizing impact on it.|$|E
