Labeled a “Social Democrat” instead of being primarily nationalist, La Luz decided instead to become active in Democratic Party politics.

25|$|The series fleshes out Scrooge's {{upbringing}} by depicting {{his life}} as an individual who worked hard his entire life to earn his keep and to fiercely defend it against those who were truly dishonest, But also, he defend {{his family and friends}} from any dangers,including villains.

25|$|Ælfric {{was asked}} by Æthelweard to {{translate}} the book of Genesis up {{to the story of}} Abraham and Isaac, along with selections from other books of the Hexateuch. Against his better judgment, Ælfric agreed because he knew it would be done regardless of whether he helped or not. This, the Old English Hexateuch, was revolutionary, for {{it was the first time}} that the Bible was translated from Latin into the vernacular, that is, into Old English. To his translation of Genesis, he wrote a preface. This preface was to ensure that the uneducated who might read this translation of the Old Testament would understand that they ought not believe that the practices of the ancient Israelites were still acceptable for Christians. In his preface, Ælfric employs the same writing techniques that King Alfred used in his preface to a translation of the Cura Pastoralis. Also notable is that in his translation of Genesis Ælfric did not just translate it word for word from the Latin, which was common due to the belief that the word order of sacred Scripture was itself sacred. Rather, he translated much of it by its meaning; he recognized that the meaning of what the Bible said was the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be conveyed, not the word order.|$|E

The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{thought it was a}} [...] "quintessential" [...] Swartzwelder episode, and executive producer/show runner David Mirkin said it was a [...] "fantastic job by one of the most prolific writers of the show". The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> Mirkin while making the episode was {{to make sure that the}} elephant would be a [...] "bastard" [...] and behave rudely, unlike other animals on the show. For example, instead of putting people on his back, Stampy would put them in his mouth. Mirkin said the elephant [...] "never quite bonds because it's a very cantankerous animal, a concept that was very important to this episode". Stampy has since been used several times in jokes later on in the series. For example, Stampy made an appearance in the season nine episode [...] "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace" [...] in one of Bart's dreams, and in the season fourteen episode [...] "Large Marge", where he is used by Bart in a stunt to help Krusty the Clown win back his popularity. Stampy appeared briefly in The Simpsons Movie, where he tries to break down the giant glass dome lowered over Springfield. The episode also introduces the character Cletus Spuckler. He is shown as one of the [...] "slack-jawed yokels" [...] gawking at Stampy in the Simpson family's backyard. Cletus is not named in the episode, so the staff simply referred to him as the Slack-Jawed Yokel.|$|E

To win with the shit we write about." [...] The ceremony was held on February 11, 2007, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, with Slayer competing against Mastodon, Lamb of God, Ministry and Stone Sour. Slayer won the Best Metal Performance Grammy award, although the band was unable to attend because of a conflicting North American headlining tour. Araya commented about the win from a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio: [...] "Jeff [...] and I put a lot into 'Eyes of the Insane' so we're thrilled that the Grammy voters took the time to listen to it, and then vote for it. We're out here on the road and we're all really, really happy." [...] King disagreed, deeming the song [...] "one of the poorest representations of us [...] on the record [...] ". He further said that, if given the decision, he would have chosen the controversial track [...] "Jihad" [...] to represent Slayer from their ninth album Christ Illusion.
