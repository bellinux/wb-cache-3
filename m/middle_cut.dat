5000|$|A hammerbeam roof is a decorative, open timber {{roof truss}} typical of English Gothic {{architecture}} {{and has been}} called [...] "...the most spectacular endeavour of the English Medieval carpenter." [...] They are traditionally timber framed, using short beams projecting from the wall on which the rafters land, essentially a tie beam which has the <b>middle</b> <b>cut</b> out. These short beams are called hammer-beams and give this truss its name. A hammerbeam roof can have a single, double or false hammerbeam truss.|$|E

5000|$|A bread bowl is a round loaf {{of bread}} which has had {{a large portion of}} the <b>middle</b> <b>cut</b> out to create an edible bowl. They are {{typically}} larger than a roll but smaller than a full sized {{loaf of bread}}. Bread bowls can be used to serve chili, New England-style clam chowder, and other thick stews (often, but not always, with a cheese or cream base). Soups with thinner bases are not generally served in bread bowls, as the broth would make the bread get too soggy too quickly. The bread becomes flavored as it absorbs some of the stew's base, and can be eaten after the stew has been eaten.|$|E

50|$|The {{story is}} about the {{interactions}} between Kiyoko (Hideko Takamine) and her bank clerk bachelor confidant Kenkichi (Toshiro Mifune). Kiyoko, {{along with her husband}} Shinji (Keiju Kobayashi), wants to open a coffee shop and so goes to Kenkichi to ask for a loan. Family financial and emotion troubles mount within her household, and Kiyoko falls for the handsome Kenkichi. Their entire relationship is a series of beginnings and endings with the <b>middles</b> <b>cut</b> out. It is at first purely a business association, though after Shinji (at the manipulative behest of his matchmaker mother) gives a majority of the loan to his deadbeat brother Zenichi, Kiyoko starts to think that her feelings for Kenkichi may be more than platonic.|$|R
50|$|Mining in Portland is done {{by using}} a room and pillar method. The mine is {{advanced}} by extracting the stone using an abrasive tool chain cutter mounted on a machine. Slots are cut into the top, bottom, sides and middle of the stone. A flat steel pillow is inserted into the <b>middle</b> <b>cut</b> and slowly inflated with water. The stones are gently broken off at the back without placing any stress on the resulting blocks. The method of extraction is significantly more expensive than blasting, but results in a higher yield thereby saving valuable reserves for future generations. The environmental benefits are substantial as mining significantly reduces the impact on wildlife and the local community with reduced noise and dust.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 11 mm. The forewings are fuscous, becoming darker on the posterior half. There is a narrow white streak along the median {{third of the}} costa, attenuated anteriorly {{and there is also}} a broad ochreous-white longitudinal band occupying the wing except the costal third and a dorsal streak from near the base to the <b>middle,</b> <b>cut</b> by a very oblique streak of groundcolour beyond the middle, and a very oblique posterior line acutely angulated near the dorsum, some yellowish tinge between these. An oblique white striga is found from the costa at three-fourths and there is a white dot on the costa before the apex, extended into the cilia. There is also an obscure dark fuscous apical dot. The hindwings are grey with a cloudy whitish dot in the apical projection.|$|E
50|$|Barley is {{soaked in}} {{water from the}} source {{for two to three}} days then spread over the floor of the malting house. The green malt is then dried in a kiln over peat smoke. The malt is then milled into grist, which is like a coarse flour. Grist is then mixed with hot water in the mash tun at about 70 °C for about an hour. This is drained off and the second water, which is hotter, is added and allowed to run {{straight}} through. The third water is even hotter and is used as the first water for the next batch. The sugary wort is collected, cooled and then fermented in large pine vessels called wash backs. Yeast is added and after 48 hours of fermentation the wash is made. The wash is then pre-heated in a wash-charger and from there goes to the wash still. This is a traditional pot still made of copper and is of a shape unchanged in the history of Scotch whisky making. The wash is heated in the pot still so the alcohol vapour rises up and cools and condenses in the low wines receiver. The low wines then passes through to the spirit still where it is distilled again. The spirit running through the pot and spirit stills is subject to Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise Duty and so is kept under lock and key. It can be sampled and tested by the stillman via the spirit sample safe. The spirit from the spirit still is divided in three parts, but only the <b>middle</b> <b>cut</b> or “Heart of the Run” is suitable to be made into malt whisky. The other two parts are fed back into the low wines receiver to be re-distilled. The <b>middle</b> <b>cut</b> then goes to an oak spirit receiver and from there to the filling vats in the spirit store.|$|E

50|$|The third {{step in the}} {{production}} process is the distillation. There {{are two types of}} distillation processes used: in a pot still or in a column still. Distillation in a pot still is considered to be the traditional way of distillation (kisüsti pálinka refers to a pálinka distilled in a pot still no bigger than 1000 litres). Pálinka distilled in a pot still is always double distilled. In the first step, the alcohol is extracted from the fermented mash; the result is called alszesz (low alcohol). In the second step, the taste of the fruit is extracted from the fermented mash. The second distillation has the biggest influence {{on the quality of the}} pálinka and thus requires special skills. During the second distillation one distinguishes between előpárlat (foreshots), középpárlat (<b>middle</b> <b>cut)</b> and utópárlat (feints). The előpárlat is not used, even though much of the taste is contained in this cut. The középpárlat is the one that gives the body of the distillate.|$|E

5000|$|A {{trade in}} salt meat {{occurred}} across ancient Europe. In Polybius's time, the Gauls exported salt pork {{each year to}} Rome in large quantities, where it was sold in different cuts: rear <b>cuts,</b> <b>middle</b> <b>cuts,</b> hams, and sausages. This meat, after having been salted with the greatest care, was sometime smoked. These goods {{had to have been}} considerably important, since they fed part of the Roman people and the armies. The Belgians were celebrated above all for the care which they gave to the fattening of their pigs. Their herds of sheep and pigs were so many, they could provide skins and salt meat not only for Rome, but also for most of Italy. The Ceretani of Spain drew a large export income from their hams, which were so succulent, they were in no way inferior to those of Cantabria. These [...] of pig would become especially sought, {{to the point that the}} ancients considered this meat the most nourishing of all and the easiest to digest.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} general {{criterion}} for cut elimination in sequent calculi for propositional modal logics, which rests on absorption of cut, contraction, weakening and inversion by the purely modal {{part of the}} rule system. Our criterion applies also {{to a wide variety}} of logics outside the realm of normal modal logic. We give extensive example instantiations of our framework to various conditional logics. For these, we obtain fully internalised calculi which are substantially simpler than those known in the literature, along with leaner proofs of cut elimination and complexity. In one case, conditional logic with modus ponens and conditional excluded <b>middle,</b> <b>cut</b> elimination and complexity were explicitly stated as open in the literature. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we present}} a new image {{indexing}} and retrieval method for image database applications. We introduce a novel image content description feature termed Scene Structural Matrix (SSM). The SSM captures the overall structural information of the scene by indexing the geometric features of the image. In this work, we also introduce a constraint adaptive image segmentation method termed <b>Middle</b> <b>Cut</b> (MC) to partition the image and derive the multi-scale geometric structures of the image. Experimental results show that SSM is particularly effective in retrieving images with strong structural features, such as landscape photographs. It is also shown that SSM is robust against spatial and spectral distortions thus making it superior to traditional colour histogram, colour correlogram and MPEG 7 -Color Structure histogram in certain applications...|$|E
40|$|A new, {{parallel}} {{approach for}} generating Bresenham-type lines is developed. Coordinate pairs which approximate straight lines on a square grid {{are derived from}} line equations. These pairs serve {{as a basis for}} the development of four new parallel algorithms. One of the algorithms uses the fact that straight line generation is equivalent to a vector prefix sums calculation. The algorithms execute on a binary tree of processors. Each node in the tree performs a simple calculation that involves only additions and shifts. All four algorithms have time complexity O(log 2 n) where n in the form 2 m denotes the number of points generated and n Γ 1 is the number of processors in the tree. This compares to O(n) for Bresenham's algorithm executed on a sequential processor. Pipelining can be used to achieve a constant time per line generation as long as line length is less than n.
