Using a new device model that faithfully reproduces measurements of BFO-MIM structures we analyze how the switching characteristic affect the STDP learning window.

40|$|In {{terms of}} speed and bandwidth, {{photonic}} components are superior to their electronic counterparts. However, the diffraction limit has restricted downscaling of the conventional dielectric waveguides, where electromagnetic modes are confined to an optically dens core.

30|$|Numerical {{calculation}} {{is carried}} out to study optical properties and sensing performance of <b>MIM</b> <b>structure</b> sensor with patterned triangle unit. The enhanced local electric field and high absorption simultaneously is attributed to the strong lighting rod effect of Au triangle disks, plasmonic resonance coupling of electric resonance among Au triangle disks and magnetic resonance which dwelled in the SiO 2 layer, and high-density arranged triangle MIM arrays. The interaction among adjacent triangle disks of our structure and parameter effect on absorption peak is negligible. The thicknesses of the SiO 2 layer and top Au layer influence the position and amplitude of peaks, which are caused by adjusting electric dipoles and magnetic dipoles of <b>MIM</b> <b>structure</b> to match impedance, and the increasing of geometric dimensions of triangles when the thickness of SiO 2 /Au triangle layer increases. When the suggested structure matches its effective impedance well, the absorption is extremely high (>[*] 90 %). Due to the long tips of triangle Au arrays, the FWHM of peaks is very narrow, about 5  nm. The obtained RIS and FOM are about 660  nm/RIU and 132, respectively, for environment refractive index 1.33 ~[*] 1.36, which are excellent results compared with previous reports.|$|R
40|$|Gap-plasmons (GP) in metal-insulator-metal (<b>MIM)</b> <b>structures</b> {{have shown}} {{exceptional}} performance in guiding and concentrating light within deep subwavelength layers.

Here, we propose a mechanism for the three dimensional concentration of light in planar <b>MIM</b> <b>structures</b> which exploits exclusively the lateral tapering of the front metallic layer while keeping a constant thickness of the insulating layer. We demonstrate that an array of tapered planar GP nanocavities can efficiently concentrate light in all three dimensions.

Three-dimensional simulations are then used to precisely calculate the optical behavior. Cavities with effective volumes as small as 10 ^(− 5) λ^ 3 are achieved in an ultrathin MIM configuration.

30|$|To {{analyze the}} detail, a {{periodic}} model, with top view {{as shown in}} Fig.  1 d, illuminated by a linear polarization light source (wavelength of 893.8  nm that is {{the position of the}} main peak), is built. The electric field |E| is given in Fig.  2 c–g. Figure  2 c–e is electric field distribution of xoz plane (y[*]=[*] 0  nm), with gap size of 20  nm, 30  nm, and 50  nm, respectively. The maximum |E| occurs among the gap of adjacent Au triangles for condition of gap size of 10  nm, and at the tips of Au triangles for bigger gap sizes. The maximum value varies from 54 to 61, which is a slight fluctuation. However, the electric field among SiO 2 layer is extremely low. It is the same situation with that of the MII structure array, with a gap size of 30  nm, shown in Fig.  1 f. The maximum field occurs also at the tips of Au triangles, about 48, which is a little smaller than that of the <b>MIM</b> <b>structure</b> array model with same gap sizes. The electric field of the SiO 2 layer is close to zero, while magnetic field |H| is enhanced, as shown in Fig.  2 g. The |H| can be improved by adjusting thickness of spacer and Au triangles. Comparing with previous research on <b>MIM</b> <b>structure</b> absorbers [32, 34] and our finding, it can be concluded that although coupling may exist between adjacent Au triangles, small changing of this kind of triangles (with very long and sharp tips) will not result in movement of the main peak and reduction of the enhanced local field. The local enhancement of electric field (~[*] 48 times of incident field) at tips of isolated Au triangles is due to the tip size effect or lighting rod effect [33, 35], which results in ~[*] 42 % absorption of the main peak of MII structure models. The large local electric field (>[*] 54 times of incident field) and high absorption (>[*] 90 %) of the main peaks should be ascribed to the simultaneous lighting rod effect of Au triangle disks and the fundamental magnetic resonance mode among SiO 2 spacer layers, which excite the <b>MIM</b> <b>structure</b> array responding to the incident light, resulting in ultranarrow FWHM of the main peaks with high absorption. The FWHM of its main absorption peaks is significantly smaller than that of the <b>MIM</b> <b>structure</b> with normal triangle disks [32], which benefits its sensing performance. The decrease of absorption of MIM with halving triangle in each unit is due to a low density of “hot spots” [36]. In addition, the reflect Au also provide extra opportunity for LSPR absorption among Au disks. Thus, the field enhancement of triangle <b>MIM</b> <b>structure</b> array is a little higher than that of monolayer triangle array on Si [37]. Lastly, the electric field of xoy plane (z[*]=[*]−[*] 30  nm, the upper surface of top Au layer) of the MIM array model is given in Fig.  2 h. Clear bright spots can be seen at all tips of the Au triangles. However, it can be observed that the spots lied in the center line, which is parallel to the x-axis (the polarized direction of illumination) of a vertex of a triangle and is brighter. The phenomenon is in accord with the results shown in Ref. [37, 38], which indicates that part of the main electric field contribution comes from the in-plane component parallel to the incoming light.|$|R
