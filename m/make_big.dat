5|$|In his {{autobiography}} Belgrano {{declared that he}} did not have any previous knowledge of being included in the junta, and that his appointment took him by surprise. Nevertheless, he accepted the role. He was part of the political line of Mariano Moreno; they were expecting to use the government to <b>make</b> <b>big</b> changes in the social order. One of his first rulings was the making of a Maths Academy, located in the building of the Consulate and with the purpose of instructing the military. Belgrano was appointed its protector. He supported the banishment of Cisneros and the members of the Real Audience, and the execution of Liniers and other counter-revolutionaries defeated in Córdoba. Some historians suggest that he would have promoted the creation of the Operations plan, a secret document written by Moreno that set harsh ways for the junta to achieve its goals, while others consider the whole document a literary forgery done by royalists to discredit the junta. A few others suspect that some paragraphs or the whole document may have been the result of collaborative writing between Moreno, Belgrano, and Hipólito Vieytes.|$|E

However, India won the series 3–0 after relatively convincing victories. Sri Lanka also played a Test match, and Dias made two fifties as he and Duleep Mendis cooperated to draw the match.|$|E

25|$|Born in Salisbury, Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) into a tobacco-farming family, Hick was {{at first}} more {{interested}} in hockey than cricket, and indeed went on {{to play for the}} national schools hockey team. He was also more of a bowler than a batsman, but in 1979 he began to <b>make</b> <b>big</b> scores regularly, averaging 185 for the school side. He suffered from a mild form of meningitis in 1980, but he nevertheless progressed to become captain of the national Junior Schools team, and before long to play for the Senior Schools side.|$|E
25|$|Republicans {{strongly}} opposed Obama's 2009 {{economic stimulus package}} and 2010 health care reform bill. The Tea Party movement, formed in early 2009, provided a groundswell of conservative grassroots activism to oppose policies of the Obama administration. With an expected economic recovery being criticized as sluggish, the GOP was expected to <b>make</b> <b>big</b> gains in the 2010 midterm elections. However, establishment Republicans began to see themselves at odds with Tea Party activists, who sought to run conservative candidates in primary elections to defeat the more moderate establishment-based candidates. Incumbent senators such as Bob Bennett in Utah and Lisa Murkowski in Alaska lost primary contests in their respective states.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{stayed at}} the home of McCartney and his wife Linda during the {{recording}} sessions, and became friends with both. While at the dining table one evening, Paul McCartney brought out a booklet that displayed all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. [...] "This is the way to <b>make</b> <b>big</b> money", the musician informed Jackson. [...] "Every time someone records one of these songs, I get paid. Every time someone plays these songs on the radio, or in live performances, I get paid." [...] McCartney's words influenced Jackson's later purchase of ATV Music Publishing in 1985.|$|E
500|$|A {{short time}} before {{his return to}} Buenos Aires on 3 June 1794, Belgrano was elected by Don Diego de Gardoqui as [...] "perpetual secretary" [...] of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires, a new local {{institution}} which dealt with commercial and industrial issues {{in the name of}} the crown. This date would be later known in Argentina as Economist Day. He would remain in this office until 1810, and would deal with commercial disputes and promote agriculture, industry, and commerce. Not having enough freedom to <b>make</b> <b>big</b> changes in the economic system, he made big efforts to improve education. Influenced by Campomanes, he believed that the true wealth of countries was human ingenuity, and that the best way to promote industrialisation was through education.|$|E

[...] Yin's mother published a book, From Andover to Harvard, about how her son was accepted by Harvard, but Yin only allowed his full name to appear in the book's preface. [...] Tang received at least six offers from publishers to have a book written about her, but declined them all. Nevertheless, many of China's top students are still compared to [...] "Harvard Girl," [...] and admissions to top overseas universities often <b>make</b> <b>big</b> news in mainland China; for example, Cheng Wanxin (程琬芯) attracted media attention in Sichuan province when she was accepted to Harvard in April 2009.|$|E
500|$|By the mid-1980s, ATV Music Publishing and Pye Records {{were both}} up for sale. The {{companies}} were bought relatively cheaply by Australian businessman Robert Holmes à Court, who acquired Associated Communications Corporation (the parent company) in 1982, asset-stripped the subsidiaries, and sacked many long serving employees before selling the companies on again. During this time, American singer Michael Jackson was recording [...] "Say Say Say" [...] for Paul McCartney's Pipes of Peace album. Jackson {{stayed at the}} home of McCartney and his wife Linda during the recording sessions, becoming friendly with both. One evening whilst at the dining table, McCartney brought out a thick, bound notebook displaying all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. Jackson grew more excited as he examined the pages. He inquired about how to buy songs and what the songs were used for. McCartney explained that music publishing was a way to <b>make</b> <b>big</b> money. Jackson replied by telling McCartney that he would buy The Beatles' songs one day. McCartney laughed, saying [...] "Great. Good joke." ...|$|E

He added: [...] "In the dressing room during county games they would break out into ironic song about the few chances they got." [...] Loxton {{reported that}} these songs included the [...] "odd risque limerick". Bradman did later state that [...] "because of the strong array of batsman ahead of him, [...] seldom had an opportunity to <b>make</b> <b>big</b> scores" [...] but [...] "was an extremely useful reserve who could have been played in the Tests with confidence". Following the 1948 tour, Bradman described Hamence as [...] "a fine batsman of the strictly orthodox type. Very sound and reliable with his game based on driving" [...] and a [...] "very safe fieldsman". Bradman added that Hamence had few opportunities because of Australia's batting strength but [...] "always batted well and often at a critical moment made valuable runs". Bradman said that Hamence [...] "could have been played in the Tests with confidence" [...] and praised his contributions to team morale. Fingleton said [...] "there was criticism of his selection in this side, but had the war not intervened he undoubtedly would have made a [...] trip before".|$|E

500|$|His {{hard line}} with Williams created the {{perception}} that Culverhouse was more concerned with profits than with putting a winning team on the field. It aroused suspicions that Culverhouse's main concern was the Buccaneers' salary structure, {{and that this was}} related to the frequency with which the team traded away its first-round draft choices. Williams' comments that he would have been treated differently had he been white resonated with the Bay Area African American community, who saw the Buccaneers' ensuing on-field woes as retribution, boycotted Buccaneer games by the thousands, and commented that Culverhouse throws parties that cost more than what Williams was asking for. The Buccaneers missed Williams' confidence and ability to <b>make</b> <b>big</b> plays at key times, and lost their first nine games in 1983, when they had been expected to contend for the playoffs. They finished 2–14, the first of what would be 14 consecutive losing seasons—the longest since the merger between the NFL and the All-America Football Conference in 1950—and would not have another winning season in Culverhouse's lifetime. They would lose 10 or more games in 13 of those years, including 12 in a row from 1983 to 1994—an NFL record. [...] The timing of the situation coincided with the ascendance of the Tampa Bay Bandits, who led the USFL in attendance with a wide-open, crowd-pleasing offense led by local hero Steve Spurrier, while the Buccaneers were losing games with a conservative offense that fans found boring. [...] Attendance having dropped sharply, Culverhouse then further alienated fans by berating them, accusing them of apathy.|$|E
500|$|Writing for GamePro, Captain Squideo called Destruction Derby [...] "the most raucous racing {{experience}} of the fall". He believed that its [...] "graphics are almost all you could want for a game" [...] of this type, but wrote that [...] "nothing here stands out as graphically spectacular". He complained that the game does not let players customise cars, and he disliked its lack of split-screen multiplayer. He summarised, [...] "Limited options keep Destruction Derby out of the winner's circuit, but this rowdy stock-car racer still generates a stadium full of thrashin' fun." [...] Victor Lucas of The Electric Playground stated that [...] "the beauty of the game" [...] is the strategy involved in making [...] "calculated strikes" [...] against enemy vehicles, and he wrote, [...] "If you go all {{out and try to}} <b>make</b> <b>big</b> noise on the track, more than likely you'll be limping to the scrap yard in seconds." [...] He believed that the game's Stock Car racing mode [...] "is no match for the white knuckle inertia of either Wipeout or Ridge Racer", and that the demolition derbies in The Bowl were [...] "most fun to be had" [...] in the game. He praised the game's graphics and physics, and concluded, [...] "Destruction Derby is a winner in every capacity." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation was extremely pleased with the concept of smashing into other cars, saying it taps into a near-universal fantasy. He remarked the single-player mode is indefinably [...] "lacking" [...] but the multiplayer offers unqualified enjoyment.|$|E
