For example, to ensure consistency with an external macroeconomic projection, it is necessary to calibrate salary growth over the career.|$|E
40|$|This article explores a gendered expansionary <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>scenario</b> for Europe as an {{alternative}} to the current direction of austerity policies over the medium to long-term. Using a macroeconomic forecasting model we demonstrate that the dual aim of economic growth and increases in both male and female employment can be achieved via the adoption of gender-sensitive expansionary macroeconomic policies and by overturning austerity policies. Projections for our gendered expansionary <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>scenario</b> suggest that an additional 14 million jobs, of which 9 million are for women, could be created by 2030 in the Eurozone and the United Kingdom by reversing austerity policies and marshalling government expenditure and investment towards female and male employment. We also show that these positive results are not achieved at the expense of high levels of debts and fiscal deficits. The main recommendation is for Europe to roll back austerity policies and to embark on a new gender-focused economic trajectory...|$|E

Once the key conditions for rentierism are established, we study the case of Russia.

Under such a scenario, model simulations project sustained growth and containment of debt-to-GDP ratios...|$|R
40|$|Greece {{has reached}} a point where, under any {{plausible}} <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>scenario,</b> public debt will continue growing faster than GDP. Fiscal consolidation alone cannot close the solvency gap. A substantial reduction in the stock of debt is needed. Even post-debt restructuring, {{there is no guarantee}} that the government will succeed in its dual goal of restoring fiscal solvency and closing the competitiveness gap. Yet we think Greece stands a better chance of accomplishing these goals from inside the EMU rather than outside it. This chapter takes stock of the factors that led to the explosion of public debt, the loss of competitiveness, and the failure of the first EU-IMF programme. We also present our views on the likely debt restructuring (and post-restructuring) scenarios. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a panel {{analysis}} is employed {{to investigate the}} effects of fiscal policies on stock market indexes in 11 members of the Eurozone. Many {{studies have focused on}} the effects of monetary policy on the stock market, whereas the number of contributions studying the effects of fiscal policy on the stock market is surprisingly limited. Therefore,we know little,if any,on the signand stability of the stock market reaction to fiscal policies. Our results show that fiscal policies influence the stock market and that, following an increase(decrease) in public deficit,stock market indexes go down(up). Nevertheless,further analysis shows that the signs of the estimated stock market reactions are not constant overtime and that they change according to the surrounding <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>scenario...</b>|$|E
30|$|Labor {{productivity}} growth rate {{is the main}} element of the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>scenario.</b> In the long run, the growth in labor productivity (output per hour worked) broadly coincides with TFP growth divided by the labor share (set at 0.65). In particular, the EPC assumptions establish that TFP growth rates (for each country) will converge to a long-term historical average TFP growth rate recorded in the EU, of 1.1 %. However, as a sensitivity exercise, {{we are going to}} consider a new scenario for the {{productivity growth}} rate where the growth rate is 50 % lower in the short run and 12 % lower in the long run. 16 As we will see along the paper, the effects of the ‘silent reform’ would be minor when we consider this alternative scenario with a lower productivity growth rate.|$|E
40|$|This {{discussion}} paper presents a microsimulation model of household distress. We use logit analysis {{to estimate the}} extent to which a household’s risk of being financially distressed depends on net income after tax and loan servicing costs. The impact of assumed macroeconomic shocks on this net income concept is calculated at the household level. The microsimulation model is used to simulate both the number of distressed households and their aggregate debt in various <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>scenarios.</b> The simulations indicate that household credit risks to banks are relatively well contained. financial stability; indebtedness; micro simulations; households...|$|R

Asset value changes of a credit portfolio are linked to a dynamic global macroeconometric model, allowing macro effects to be isolated from idiosyncratic shocks.

The model is able to control for firm-specific heterogeneity as well as generate multi-period forecasts of the entire loss distribution, conditional on specific <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>scenarios.</b> risk management, economic interlinkages, loss forecasting, default correlation...|$|R
40|$|The CLASS {{model is}} a {{top-down}} capital stress testing framework that projects the effect of different macroeconomic scenarios on U. S. banking firms. The model is based on simple econometric models estimated using public data and also on assumptions about loan loss provisioning, taxes, asset growth, and other factors. We use this framework to calculate a projected industry capital gap relative to a target ratio {{at different points in}} time under a common stressful <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>scenario.</b> This estimated capital gap began rising four years before the financial crisis and peaked at the end of 2008. The gap has since fallen sharply and is now significantly below precrisis levels. In the cross-section, firms projected to be most sensitive to macroeconomic conditions have higher capital ratios, consistent with a 'precautionary' view of bank capital...|$|E

However, the literature has not developed a consistent or integrated analysis of this process. We have used a detailed simulation model to identify how macroeconomic factors (such as exchange rate, labor costs, and household consumption) have contributed to manufacturing dynamics. Our results indicate that the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>scenario</b> explains {{a large portion of the}} manufacturing industry's participation loss. The rise in households consumption and investment, important factors in this period, were responsible for dampening of the pressures coming from the currency appreciation and the workforce costs, benefiting some industrial sectors, but not avoiding the manufacturings participation loss.

40|$|The global {{economic}} crisis of 2007 - 8 pushed many advanced economies into a liquidity trap, a <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>scenario</b> characterised by nomial rates at the zero lower bound (ZLB), low inflation and output below trend. We design an experiment to generate empirical {{evidence on the}} effectiveness of policies aimed at managing expectations against liquidity traps in a controlled laboratory environment where expectations are elicied directly from human subjects. Our results suggest that monetary policy alone is not sufficient to insulate the economy form the risk of falling into a liquidity trap, even if it preventively cuts the policy augmented with a fiscal switching rule succeeds in avoiding and escapiing liquidity trap episodes. We also measure larger-than-unity fiscal mulipliers when monetary policy is constrained by the ZLB. Experimental results in different treatments are well explained by adaptive learning...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model to conduct macro stress test of credit risk for the banking system based on {{scenario}} analysis. We employ an original bank level data set with disaggregated credit loans for business and consumer loans. The results corroborate {{the presence of a}} strong procyclical behavior of credit quality, and show a robust negative relationship between (the logistic transformation of) NPLs and GDP growth, with a lag response up to three quarters. The models also indicate substantial variations in the cyclical behavior of NPLs across credit types. Stress tests suggest that the banking system is well prepared to absorb the credit losses associated with a set of distressed <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>scenarios</b> without threatening financial stability. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} pay for a government-led {{investment}} strategy to achieve the millennium development goals (MDGs) is determined by the resources available to the government through economic growth, taxation, loans, and grants. Unsustainable public debts increase poverty directly through negative impacts on economic growth as well as indirectly through cuts in spending. Hence, the issue of fiscal debt sustainability is critical for achieving the MDGs.

40|$|Family Agriculture (FA), {{supported}} by the Brazilian govemment and society, is recognized as essential for rural life-quality improvement and {{for the maintenance of}} natural resources. FA competes for the same natural and regional resources as commercial agricultural production. Without support the commercial production would tend to withdraw FA from the most suited regions. FA has important differences when compared to commercial agriculture. The consumption-driven propose ofFA rather than the market-orientation of commercial agriculture influences the factors that may improve or constrain production. In FA high yields are usually substituted by crop quality standards and monocultural systems by diversified production. The <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>scenario</b> that drives the markets for most commercial crops plays a minor role in FA.

We compare and contrast three scenarios for Europe: continued austerity, gender-neutral expansionary scenario and gendered expansionary scenario. Projections for our gendered expansionary scenario suggest that an additional 7. 4 million jobs for women could by created in the Eurozone and the United Kingdom by reversing austerity policies, by gendering and increasing government expenditure and private investment. Further, higher growth rates under the gendered expansionary scenario lead to significant reductions of debt-to-GDP ratios and lower budget deficits.
