The ed17 {{noted that}} during his tenure, the {{newspaper}} expanded its scope beyond the English Wikipedia {{to the wider}} Wikimedia movement. In a January 2015 tenth-anniversary retrospective, Gamaliel emphasized that further improvements to the newspaper depended on collaboration and involvement by the Wikipedia community and invited users to contribute suggestions and join the editing team. In their first issue of the newspaper as editors-in-chief, Go Phightins! and Gamaliel wrote about the unique role of The Signpost: [...] "We will strive to <b>maintain</b> <b>our</b> voice and standing as an independent entity, separate from the WMF, Wikimedia chapters, WikiEd, or other entities." ...|$|E

Kekal owns the copyrights of the band's recording masters and has 100% artistic control over music, production and artwork. Kekal has recorded and produced most of its albums in its own studio/workstation, manages the band itself, does its own photo sessions, and designs its own album artwork and covers. As Jeff stated, [...] "So far, we've been known as an independent band who never want to get signed by record label, to <b>maintain</b> <b>our</b> independency and control over our artistic freedom, and also to own our recording masters and copyright..

Beyoncé {{has noted that}} their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyoncé has said that [...] "the group felt it still had something to offer musically" [...] with the album before adding: [...] "We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as {{just the fact that}} three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.". Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10years?

Disraeli's expansionist foreign policy, which Victoria endorsed, led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. [...] "If we are to <b>maintain</b> <b>our</b> position as a first-rate Power", she wrote, [...] "we must... be Prepared for attacks and wars, somewhere or other, CONTINUALLY." [...] Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign, protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers: [...] "It is not in our custom to annexe countries", she said, [...] "unless we are obliged & forced to do so." [...] To Victoria's dismay, Disraeli lost the 1880 general election, and Gladstone returned as prime minister.

2500|$|The {{incentive}} to use 100% renewable energy, for electricity, transport, or even {{total primary energy}} supply globally, has been motivated by global warming and other ecological {{as well as economic}} concerns.

At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. [...] Also, Professors S. Pacala and Robert H.

[...] Indeed, beginning with her 2009 trip to Pakistan, Clinton had faced questions about U.S. drone strikes, which she refused to comment much upon at the time.
