40|$|This work {{contributes}} to two fields {{of research at}} millimeter wavelengths: waveguide impedance tuners and Schottky diodes. Three novel impedance tuning devices for frequencies between 75 - 220 GHz are presented and new modeling and characterization methods applicable to millimeter-wave and THz Schottky diodes are introduced. In addition, the use of waveguide impedance tuners and Schottky diodes is demonstrated in three different applications. Waveguide tuners are used for dielectric material characterization at 75 - 110 GHz and in a fundamental frequency <b>mixer</b> <b>diode</b> test platform at 183 GHz. Schottky diodes characterized in this work are used in a novel MMIC frequency tripler for 75 - 140 GHz and in the aforementioned 183 GHz <b>mixer</b> <b>diode</b> test platform. Waveguide impedance tuners are widely used {{in a variety of}} applications at millimeter wavelengths, ranging from device matching to load-pull and noise parameter measurements. The three impedance tuners presented in this work are a multiwaveguide-band backshort, waveguide EH-tuner for 140 - 220 GHz, and a double-stub E-plane tuner for 75 - 110 GHz. All impedance tuners are based on the dielectric backshort concept, which offers resonance-free operation, low losses, and tuning with higher resolution than is possible with traditional backshorts. For example, at the center frequency of the W-band, 92 GHz, the VSWR of the multiwaveguide-band backshort is larger than 165 for all positions of the backshort and the phase resolution {{as a function of the}} backshort movement is 0. 0825 (deg) / 10 micrometers, which is 10 times more accurate than with a traditional backshort. The Schottky diode is the workhorse in almost all room temperature mixer and frequency multiplier applications at 100 - 3000 GHz. Design of Schottky-based circuits at these frequencies relies on accurate models for the Schottky diode. In this work, a novel method is presented for simultaneous extraction of Schottky diode series resistance and thermal resistance. The method avoids the inaccuracies inherent in the traditional I-V extraction methods caused by the self-heating of the diode, which can result in too small a value for the extracted series resistance. In addition, a quantitative comparison of low-frequency (1 MHz) and microwave frequency (3 - 10 GHz) capacitance determination techniques is performed for millimeter-wave and THz Schottky diodes...|$|E

40|$|This Thesis {{presents}} a passive wireless sensor utilizing the modulated backscattering principle. The sensor {{consists of an}} antenna, a rectifier, an oscillator, and a modulator. When the sensor is illuminated by a continuous wave (CW), the rectifier generates a DC supply voltage for the oscillator, which drives the modulator. As a consequence, the sensor produces a modulation to the reflected (CW). Sensing can be realized by designing the oscillator such that its frequency depends on the sensed variable. In this thesis, rectifier, oscillator, and modulator for the transponder are designed and implemented in practice. The operation of each part is analytically predicted using simplified models to anticipate the operation principle of the sensor. Through the analysis, sensor parameters such as rectified DC voltage, oscillator output voltage, power consumption by the oscillator and modulated reflected power of the sensor are predicted. As analytical equations indicate, the modulated reflected power of the sensor can be predicted {{as a function of}} input power of the sensor. It is found out that the rectified DC voltage depends on the diode parameters, input power and load impedance. Oscillator output voltage depends on the rectified DC voltage, oscillator circuit topology, and quality factor and characteristic impedance of the resonator. Moreover, power consumption by an oscillator can be made arbitrarily small by decreasing the capacitive divider ratio. Furthermore, modulated reflected power of the sensor depends on <b>mixer</b> <b>diode</b> parameters, input power of the sensor and output voltage of the oscillator. The operations of all parts are characterized by using simulation and measurement. Simulated and measured results show good agreement, which justifies the accuracy of the results.
