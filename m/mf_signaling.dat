Whistler-correlated amplitude perturbations were observed on a 780 -kHz <b>MF</b> <b>signal</b> propagating on an approximately 1800 km path from South America to Palmer.

50|$|R2 is {{mnemonic}} for Region Two signalling {{to differentiate}} it from R1 signalling, the North American <b>MF</b> <b>signalling.</b> Here region number two was envisioned in the 1960s to be Europe and region number one was envisioned in the 1960s {{to be the}} Bell System in North America. In practice the term R1 is rarely used for North American <b>MF</b> <b>signalling,</b> except to contrast with its European contemporary, R2. Later in the 20th century, use of R2 signalling spread beyond Europe to all regions of the globe, including Mexico on the North American continent. This spread is due largely to European telecommunications manufacturers selling their older equipment designs at a discount to developing countries while selling their higher-speed, higher-density post-R2 SS7 equipment at higher prices in more-industrialized countries. There is even sparse use of R2 in Canada, which is largely {{under the influence of}} Bell System standardization in North America.|$|R

The first five frequencies {{were used in}} a two-out-of-five code to represent decimal numbers (phone numbers), and the last frequency in combination {{with one of the}} others represented the beginning or end of a sequence of digits.

5000|$|Symbols in the DTMF and MF alphabets {{are sent}} as tone pairs; DTMF selects one tone from a [...] "high" [...] group {{and one from}} a [...] "low" [...] group, while MF selects its two tones from a common set. DTMF and MF use {{different}} tone frequencies largely to keep end users from interfering with inter-office signaling. In the 1970s, MF began {{to be replaced by}} digital out-of-band signaling, a conversion motivated in part by the widespread fraudulent use of <b>MF</b> <b>signals</b> by end users known as phone phreaks.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, {{multi-frequency}} <b>signaling</b> (<b>MF)</b> is a <b>signaling</b> {{system that}} was introduced by the Bell System after World War II. It uses a combination of tones for address (phone number) and supervision signaling. The signaling is sent in-band over the same channel as the bearer channel used for voice traffic.|$|R
50|$|MF {{and other}} in-band {{signaling}} systems differ from Signaling System 7 (SS7) {{in that the}} routing digits are out-pulsed in MF format in the same voiceband channel used for voice. The dialing user cannot detect these digits being out-pulsed because the audio connection is not established {{all the way to}} the user’s handset or device until after the connection is established with the terminating switch. Following a full connection, the same audio channel is connected to the user in order to communicate the voice, modem or fax data across that same 64-kbit channel previously used for the in-band <b>MF</b> <b>signaling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Multi-frequency {{signaling}} (MF) is a {{group of}} signaling methods that use a mixture of two pure tone (pure sine wave) sounds. Various <b>MF</b> <b>signaling</b> protocols were devised by the Bell System and CCITT. The earliest of these were for in-band signaling between switching centers, where long-distance telephone operators used a 16-digit keypad to input the next portion of the destination telephone number in order to contact the next downstream long-distance telephone operator. This semi-automated signaling and switching proved successful in both speed and cost effectiveness. Based on this prior success with using MF by specialists to establish long-distance telephone calls, dual-tone multi-frequency signaling was developed for end-user signaling without the assistance of operators.|$|E
50|$|In {{centralized}} AMA (CAMA), the originating Class 5 telephone switches used automatic number identification (ANI) and multi-frequency (<b>MF)</b> <b>signaling</b> to {{send the}} originating and dialed telephone numbers to the Class 4 toll connecting office. The Class 4 office recorded this information with punched tape machines on long strips of paper, that had approximately {{the width of a}} hand. Each day a technician cut the paper tapes and sent them to the accounting center to be read and processed to generate customer telephone bills. Each punch recorder was responsible for 100 trunks, and its associated call identity indexer (CII) identified the trunk for an initial entry when connecting the call, an answer entry when the called party answered, and a disconnect entry when the call was cleared.|$|E

40|$|A medium {{frequency}} (MF) communication system operating in an underground coal mine couples its signals {{to a long}} conductor, which acts as an MF transmission line (TL) in a tunnel to permit communications among transceivers along the line. The TL is generally the longest signal path for the system, and its propagation characteristics will {{have a major impact}} on the performance of the MF communication system. In this study, the propagation characteristics of three types of MF TLs in two layouts-on the roof and on the floor of a coal mine tunnel-were obtained in an effort to understand the propagation characteristics of different TLs in different locations. The study confirmed a low <b>MF</b> <b>signal</b> loss on all of these TLs. The study also found that the TLs in different layouts had substantially different propagation characteristics.

DTMF was known throughout the Bell System by the trademark Touch-Tone. The term was first used by AT&T in commerce on July 5, 1960 and was introduced to the public on November 18, 1963, when the first push-button telephone was made available to the public. It was a registered trademark by AT&T from September 4, 1962 to March 13, 1984. It is standardized by ITU-T Recommendation Q.23. In the UK, it is also known as MF4. In the UK, it is a requirement that the higher frequency tone is 1-4dB Louder than the low frequency tone.|$|E
40|$|Sex {{determination}} of Daphnia pulex is decided by environmental conditions. We established a suitable experimental system {{for this study}} using D. pulex WTN 6 strain, in which {{the sex of the}} offspring can be controlled by photoperiod. Long-day conditions induced females and short-day conditions induced males. Using this system, we previously found that methy farnesoate (MF), which is a putative innate juvenile hormone molecule in daphnids, is necessary for male sex determination and that protein kinase C (PKC) is a candidate factor of male sex determiner. In this study, we demonstrated that a PKC inhibitor [bisindolylmaleimide IV (BIM) ] application strongly suppressed male offspring induction in the short-day condition. Moreover, co-treatment of BIM with MF revealed that PKC signaling acts upstream of <b>MF</b> <b>signaling</b> for male sex determination. This is the first experimental evidence that PKC is involved in the male sex determination process associated with methyl farnesoate signaling in daphnid species...|$|E
40|$|The {{relatively}} simple and compact morphology of cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) {{has led to}} the view that heterogeneity in CGC shape has negligible impact upon the integration of mossy fibre (MF) information. Following electrophysiological recording, 3 D models were constructed from high-resolution imaging data to identify morphological features that could influence the coding of MF input patterns by adult CGCs. Quantification of MF and CGC morphology provided evidence that CGCs could be connected to the multiple rosettes that arise from a single MF input. Predictions from our computational models propose that MF inputs could be more densely encoded within the CGC layer than previous models suggest. Moreover, those <b>MF</b> <b>signals</b> arriving onto the dendrite closest to the axon will generate greater CGC excitation. However, the impact of this morphological variability on MF input selectivity will be attenuated by high levels of CGC inhibition providing further flexibility to the MF. CGC pathway. These features could be particularly important when considering the integration of multimodal MF sensory input by individual CGCs...|$|R

40|$|Isoprene is {{the most}} {{abundant}} non-methane biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC), but the processes governing secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from isoprene oxidation {{are only beginning to}} become understood and selective quantification of the atmospheric particulate burden remains difficult. Organic aerosol above a tropical rainforest located in Danum Valley, Borneo, Malaysia, a high isoprene emission region, was studied during Summer 2008 using Aerosol Mass Spectrometry and offline detailed characterisation using comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography. Observations indicate that a substantial fraction (up to 15 % by mass) of atmospheric sub-micron organic aerosol was observed as methylfuran (MF) after thermal desorption. This observation was associated with the simultaneous measurements of established gas-phase isoprene oxidation products methylvinylketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR). Observations of MF were also made during experimental chamber oxidation of isoprene. Positive matrix factorisation of the AMS organic mass spectral time series produced a robust factor which accounts for an average of 23 % (0. 18 μg m − 3), reaching as much as 53 % (0. 50 μg m − 3) of the total oraganic loading, identified by (and highly correlated with) a strong <b>MF</b> <b>signal.</b> Assuming that this factor is generally representative of isoprene SOA, isoprene derived aerosol plays {{a significant role in the}} region.

40|$|International audienceThe {{cerebellar}} cortex coordinates movements and maintains balance by modifying motor commands {{as a function}} of sensory-motor context, which is encoded by mossy fiber (MF) activity. MFs exhibit a wide range of activity, from brief precisely timed high-frequency bursts, which encode discrete variables such as whisker stimulation, to low-frequency sustained rate-coded modulation, which encodes continuous variables such as head velocity. While high-frequency MF inputs have been shown to activate granule cells (GCs) effectively, much less is known about sustained low-frequency signaling through the GClayer, which is impeded by a hyperpolarized resting potential and strong GABAA-mediated tonic inhibition of GCs. Here we have exploited the intrinsic MF network of unipolar brush cells to activate GCs with sustained low-frequency asynchronous MF inputs in rat cerebellar slices. We find that low-frequency MF input modulates the intrinsic firing of Purkinje cells, and that this signal transmission through the GC layer requires synaptic activation of Mg 2 +-block-resistant NMDA receptors (NMDARs) that are likely to contain the GluN 2 C subunit. Slow NMDAR conductances sum temporally to contribute approximately half the MF-GC synaptic charge at hyperpolarized potentials. Simulations of synaptic integration in GCs show that the NMDAR and slow spillover-activated AMPA receptor (AMPAR) components depolarize GCs to a similar extent. Moreover, their combined depolarizing effect enables the fast quantal AMPAR component to trigger action potentials at low MF input frequencies. Our results suggest that the weakMg(2 +) block of GluN 2 C-containing NMDA Rs enables transmission of low-frequency <b>MF</b> <b>signals</b> through the input layer of the {{cerebellar cortex}}...|$|R

Methods: A controlled clinical trial was adopted. Thirty-two patients suffering from CFS were enrolled according to the inclusion criteria from outpatient department of Shanghai Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine in China; thirty normal people whose gender, age, height and body mass were concordant with the CFS patients were selected as the normal group.
