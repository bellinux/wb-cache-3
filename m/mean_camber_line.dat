Leading edge loading and semi-vaneless space diffusion showed trends similar to those reported earlier from shroud surface experiments that did improve compressor flow range. Opposite trends are seen for hub injection cases where compressor flow range decreased.

40|$|An {{approximate}} {{theory for}} steady irrotational flow through {{a cascade of}} thin cambered airfoils is developed. Isolated thin airfoils have only slight camber is most applications, and the well known methods that replace the source and vorticity distributions of the curved <b>camber</b> <b>line</b> by similar distributions on the straight chord line are adequate. In cascades, however, the camber is usually appreciable, and significant errors are introduced if the vorticity and source distributions on the <b>camber</b> <b>line</b> are approximated by the same distribution on the chord line. The calculation of the flow field becomes very clumsy in practice if the vorticity and source distributions are not confined to a straight line. A new method is proposed and investigated; in this method, at each point on the <b>camber</b> <b>line,</b> the vorticity and sources {{are assumed to be}} distributed along a straight line tangent to the <b>camber</b> <b>line</b> at that point, and corrections are determined to account for the deviation of the actual <b>camber</b> <b>line</b> from the tangent line. Hence, the basic calculation for the cambered airfoils is reduced to the simpler calculation of the straight line airfoils, with the equivalent straight line airfoils changing from point to point. The results of the approximate method are compared with numerical solutions for cambers as high as 25 per cent of the chord. The leaving angles of flow are predicted quite well, even at this high value of the camber. The present method also gives the functional relationship between the exit angle and the other parameters such as airfoil shape and cascade geometry. </p...|$|R
40|$|This report gives {{a simple}} and exact method of calculating the lift {{distribution}} on thin wing sections. The most essential feature of the new theory is the introduction of an "ideal angle of attack," this angle being defined as that at which the flow enters the leading edge smoothly or, more precisely, as the angle of attack at which the lift {{at the leading edge}} equals zero. The lift distribution at this particular angle is shown to be a characteristic property of the section and has been termed the "basic distribution. " it is shown that the lift of a wing section may always be considered to consist of (a) the basic distribution and (b) the additional distribution, where the latter is independent of the <b>mean</b> <b>camber</b> <b>line</b> and thus identical for all thin sections. The specific reason for the poor aerodynamic qualities of thin wing sections is pointed out as being {{due to the fact that}} the additional lift in potential flow becomes infinite at the leading edge. It is established that the essential parameter occurring in this analysis is the radius of curvature at the leading edge. It is further established that the actual slope of the lift curve is dependent on this parameter. The theoretical lift distribution is compared with the distribution obtained by direct measurement on a number of the more conventional wing sections. The new theory is of value in calculating the strength of wing sections...|$|E

In this paper a computational {{study was conducted}} on the EEE (Energy Efficient Engine) HPT (High Pressure Turbine) rotor tip geometry using the commercial numerical solver ANSYS FLUENT. The flow solver was validated against aerodynamic data acquired in the NASA Transonic Turbine Blade Cascade facility. The scope of the ongoing study is to computationally investigate how the tip leakage and overall blade losses are affected by 1. injection from the tip near the pressure side, 2. injection from the tip surface at the camber line, and 3. injection from the tip surface into the tip separation bubble. The objective is to identify the locations on the tip surface at which to place appropriately configured blowing keeping in mind the film cooling application of tip blowing holes. The validation was conducted at Reynolds numbers of 85, 000, 343, 000 and 685, 000 and at engine realistic flow conditions. The coolant injection simulations were conducted at a Reynolds number of 343, 000 based on blade chord and inlet velocity and utilized the SST turbulence model in FLUENT. The key parameters examined are the number of jets, jet angle and jet location. A coolant to inlet pressure ratio of 1. 0 was studied for angles of + 30 deg., - 30 deg. and 90 deg. to the local free stream on the tip.

40|$|Axial {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in many aerodynamic applications. The design of an axial compressor configuration presents many challenges. Until recently, compressor design was done using 2 -D viscous flow analyses that solve the flow field around cascades or in meridional planes or 3 -D inviscid analyses. With the advent of modern computational methods {{it is now possible}} to analyze the 3 -D viscous flow and accurately predict the performance of 3 -D multistage compressors. It is necessary to retool the design methodologies {{to take advantage of the}} improved accuracy and physical fidelity of these advanced methods. 	In this study, a first-principles based multi-objective technique for designing single stage compressors is described. The study accounts for stage aerodynamic characteristics, rotor-stator interactions and blade elastic deformations. A parametric representation of compressor blades that include leading and trailing edge camber line angles, thickness and camber distributions was used in this study A design of experiment approach is used to reduce the large combinations of design variables into a smaller subset. A response surface method is used to approximately map the output variables as a function of design variables. An optimized configuration is determined as the extremum of all extrema. 	This method has been applied to a rotor-stator stage similar to NASA Stage 35. The study has two parts: a preliminary study where a limited number of design variables were used to give an understanding of the important design variables for subsequent use, and a comprehensive application of the methodology where a larger, more complete set of design variables are used. The extended methodology also attempts to minimize the acoustic fluctuations at the rotor-stator interface by considering a rotor-wake influence coefficient (RWIC). Results presented include performance map calculations at design and off-design speed along with a detailed visualization of the flow field at design and off-design conditions. 	The present methodology provides a way to systematically screening through the plethora of design variables. By selecting the most influential design parameters and by optimizing the blade leading edge and trailing edge <b>mean</b> <b>camber</b> <b>line</b> angles, phenomenon s such as tip blockages, blade-to-blade shock structures and other loss mechanisms can be weakened or alleviated. It is found that these changes to the configuration can have a beneficial effect on total pressure ratio and stage adiabatic efficiency, thereby improving the performance of the axial compression system. Aeroacoustic benefits were found by minimizing the noise generating mechanisms associated with rotor wake-stator interactions.
