40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of molecules {{can often be}} described by Markov processes. From computational molecular simulations one can derive transition rates or transition probabilities between subsets of the discretized conformational space. On {{the basis of this}} dynamic information, the spatial subsets are combined into a small number of so-called <b>metastable</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>conformations.</b> This is done by clustering methods like the Robust Perron Cluster Analysis (PCCA+). Up to now it is an open question how this coarse graining in space can be transformed to a coarse graining of the Markov chain while preserving the essential dynamic information. In the following article we aim at a consistent coarse graining of transition probabilities or rates on the basis of metastable conformations such that important physical and mathematical relations are preserved. This approach is new because PCCA+ computes <b>molecular</b> <b>conformations</b> as linear combinations of the dominant eigenvectors of the transition matrix which does not hold for other clustering methods...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{information}} {{over the}} entire course of binding interactions based on the analyses of energy landscapes is described, which provides a framework to understand the events involved during biomolecular recognition. Conformational dynamics of malectin's exquisite selectivity for diglucosylated N-glycan (Dig-N-glycan), a highly flexible oligosaccharide comprising of numerous dihedral torsion angles, are described as an example. For this purpose, a novel approach based on hierarchical sampling for acquiring <b>metastable</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>conformations</b> constituting low-energy minima for understanding the structural features involved in a biologic recognition is proposed. For this purpose, four variants of principal component analysis were employed recursively in both Cartesian space and dihedral angles space that are characterized by free energy landscapes to select the most stable conformational substates. Subsequently, k-means clustering algorithm was implemented for geometric separation of the major native state to acquire a final ensemble of metastable conformers. A comparison of malectin complexes was then performed to characterize their conformational properties. Analyses of stereochemical metrics and other concerted binding events revealed surface complementarity, cooperative and bidentate hydrogen bonds, water-mediated hydrogen bonds, carbohydrate-aromatic interactions including CH-pi and stacking interactions involved in this recognition. Additionally, a striking structural transition from loop to beta-strands in malectin CRD upon specific binding to Dig-N-glycan is observed. The interplay of the above-mentioned binding events in malectin and Dig-N-glycan supports an extended conformational selection model as the underlying binding mechanism...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{fluctuations}} of three-dimensional <b>molecular</b> <b>conformations</b> of {{a molecule}} in different environments play critical roles in many important {{chemical and biological}} processes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods are routinely applied to monitor the <b>molecular</b> <b>conformations</b> in condensed phases. However, some special requirements of the methods have prevented them from exploring many molecular phenomena at the current stage. Here, we introduce another method to resolve <b>molecular</b> <b>conformations</b> based on an ultrafast MIR/T-Hz multiple-dimensional vibrational spectroscopic technique. The model molecule (4 ′-methyl- 2 ′-nitroacetanilide, MNA) is prepared in two of its crystalline forms and liquid samples. Two polarized ultrafast infrared pulses are then {{used to determine the}} cross-angles of vibrational transition moment directions by exciting one vibrational band and detecting the induced response on another vibrational band of the molecule. The vibrational cross-angles are then converted into <b>molecular</b> <b>conformations</b> with the aid of calculations. The <b>molecular</b> <b>conformations</b> determined by the method are supported by X-ray diffraction and molecular dynamics simulation results. The experimental results suggest that thermodynamic interactions with solvent molecules are not altering the <b>molecular</b> <b>conformations</b> of MNA in the solutions to control their ultimate conformations in the crystals. 1...|$|R

The character of nonplanar distortions was found to be simi-lar for corresponding NH tautomers of both corroles, this point out to the features of the NH tautomer <b>molecular</b> <b>conformations.</b> Despite the fact, that all three studied <b>molecular</b> <b>conformations</b> have wave-type nonplanar distortions, the magnitudes of deviations for individual atoms are noticeably different. To estimate quantitatively the nonplanar macrocycle distortions of the corrole macrocycle the Δ 23 value has been introduced for the first time.

Small increase in the Δ 23 value has been found for the 5, 10, 15 -phenyl- 18 -nitro-corrole. It is likely to be due to synergism of the macrocycle nonplanar defor-mation and rotation of aryl substituents in the meso -positions.

40|$|A {{basic problem}} in QSAR {{modeling}} {{is how to}} obtain proper <b>molecular</b> <b>conformations</b> to generate descriptors. In pharmaceutical chemistry, it is ideal if the active conformation can be obtained, otherwise lowest-energy conformation is commonly used. There are different ways to minimize a molecule, but {{if it can be}} reasonably minimized to its global lowest-energy conformation instead of a local one is suspectable. Unfortunately this problem is generally neglected by most of the researchers.

The <b>molecular</b> <b>conformations</b> without searching process, maybe just local lowest-energy, are used as comparison. Three datasets with various structural complexities and flexibilities are investigated.
