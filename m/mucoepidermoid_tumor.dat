40|$|The {{presence}} of somatostatin (SRIF) in the neoplastic epithelial cells of certain Warthin's tumors arising {{in the human}} parotid gland was found immunohistochemically, whereas the other parotid gland tumors, such as pleomorphic adenoma, oxyphilic adenoma, <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>tumor,</b> adenocarcinoma, and adenoid cystic carcinoma, did not show positive immunoreactivity for SRIF. The SRIF-positive Warthin's tumor had dense core granules immunoreactive with anti-SRIF serum. Moreover, a comparatively high concentration of immunoreactive SRIF was detected by radioimmunoassay in an SRIF-positive Warthin's tumor, although the other tumors also contained low levels of immunoreactive SRIF...|$|E

In the present study, we show that a tracheal <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>tumor</b> biopsy obtained from a 6 year-old patient contained a subpopulation of cells with morphology, clonogenicity and surface markers that overlapped with bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs). These cells, designated as MEi (mesenchymal stem cell-like <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>tumor)</b> cells, could be differentiated towards mesenchymal lineages both with and without induction, and formed spheroids in vitro. The MEi cells shared several multipotent characteristics with BM-MSCs. However, they displayed differences to BM-MSCs in growth kinectics and gene expression profiles relating to cancer pathways and tube development. Despite this, the MEi cells did not possess in vivo tumor-initiating capacity, as proven by the absence of growth in situ after localized injection in immunocompromised mice. Our results provide an initial characterization of benign tracheal cancer-derived niche cells. We believe that this report could be of importance to further understand tracheal cancer initiation and progression as well as therapeutic development.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} 96 {{cases of}} lacrimal gland tumors, 20 patients had epithelial malignancies (11 adenoid cystic carcinomas, 7 carcinomas in pleiomorphic adenomas, 1 <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>tumor,</b> 1 adenocarcinoma, and 1 carcinoma in an epidermoid cyst). Classic computed tomographic scan changes associated with lacrimal gland malignancies {{were found in}} only 55 % of cases. The median survival was 6. 75 years in the seven patients treated with extensive surgery (orbital exenteration, possibly associated with osseous resections) and nine years in the 12 cases treated with eye-saving procedures (tumor excision, possibly followed by radiotherapy). Our data demonstrated that extensive surgery for lacrimal gland malignancies does not improve survival. Therefore, a therapeutic protocol is suggested, in which all suspected epithelial tumors (discriminated from inflammatory and lymphoid lesions by computed tomographic scan findings) undergo dacryoadenectomy, without a previous biopsy. Subsequently, {{in the case of}} carcinomas, the choice between extensive and eye-saving procedures is based on the extent and aggressiveness of the tumor and clinical findings...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Bronchoplastic {{procedures}} {{represent an}} effective surgical therapy for benign lesions, tumors of low-grade malignancy and also bronchogenic carcinoma {{in patients with}} a limited pulmonary function. We analyzed our experience in order to verify the mortality, morbidity, and long term survival in our patients. METHODS: From 1980 to 1994, 217 patients underwent bronchoplastic procedures. We performed 92 bronchoplasties, 94 bronchial sleeves, and 31 tracheo-bronchial sleeves. Histologic examination revealed 133 epidermoid carcinomas, 28 adenocarcinomas, 11 small cells lung cancers, 5 large cells carcinomas, 2 adenosquamous carcinomas, 29 bronchial carcinoids, 6 adenoidocistic carcinomas, and 3 <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>tumors.</b> Regarding nodal status, 99 patients had N 0 disease, 64 patients had N 1 disease, and 54 patients had N 2 disease. Thirty-six patients had preoperative irradiation and 181 patients had no preoperative irradiation. In 63 patients we used a perianastomotic pedicled flap; in 154 we did not use it. We considered all the 217 patients {{for the analysis of}} 30 -day mortality and morbidity; of the 217 patients we analyzed long-term survival only in 179 because we excluded 38 patients with low grade malignant neoplasm.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{immunohistochemical}} expression of androgen receptor, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor in pleomorphic adenomas, Warthin's <b>tumors,</b> <b>mucoepidermoid</b> carcinomas and adenoid cystic carcinomas of salivary glands. A total of 41 pleomorphic adenomas, 30 Warthin's <b>tumors,</b> 30 <b>mucoepidermoid</b> carcinomas and 30 adenoid cystic carcinomas were analyzed, and the immunohistochemical expression of these hormone receptors were assessed. It was observed that all cases were negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors. Androgen receptor was positive in 2 cases each of pleomorphic adenoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma. In conclusion, the results do not support a role of estrogen and progesterone in the tumorigenesis of pleomorphic adenomas, Warthin's <b>tumors,</b> <b>mucoepidermoid</b> carcinomas and adenoid cystic carcinomas. However, androgen receptors {{can play a role}} in a small set of salivary gland tumors, and this would deserve further studies...|$|R
40|$|Glandular odontogenic cysts (GOCs) {{are rare}} intrabony solitary or multiloculated cysts of odontogenic origin. In 1987, Padayachee and Van Wyk 1 first {{reported}} two cases that shared {{the features of}} both botryoid odontogenic cysts and central <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>tumors</b> and suggested that the term “sialo-odontogenic cyst ” be adopted for such lesions to avoid confusion and mismanagement. One year later, Gardner et al 2 reported eight other cases and favored the name “glandular odontogenic cyst”; they regarded it as a distinct entity due to its unusual histopathological fea-tures. In addition, this term {{was included in the}} revised edition of a World Health Organization report 3 in 1992 as “developmental odontogenic epithelial cyst. ” It has also been termed “mucoepidermoid cyst ” by Sadeghi et al 4 and “polymorphous odontogenic cyst ” by High et al. 5 In the 20 years since it was first described, 111 cases of this type of cyst have been reported, an incidence of 0. 2 % among odontogenic cysts. 6 Hence, although rare, this cyst is a well-known clinical entity and is important to recognize and diagnose due to its aggressive behavior and tendency to recur. This cyst reports a slight male predilection with a male: female ratio of 1. 3 : 1, 6 and the most-commonly affected site is the an-terior mandible. It tends to occur over a wide age range of 10 - 90 years, {{with a mean age of}} 49. 5 years. The mandible seems to be affected more commonly (87. 2 %) than the maxilla. 7 Radiographic examination reveals a well-defined cyst-like unilocular or multilocular radiolucency, often with scalloped margins and sclerotic borders. 8 In addition, there may be root resorption and tooth displacement with corti-cal perforation, leading to extension of the cyst into the adjacent soft tissues. Histologically, GOC is characterized by a cyst wall lin-ing of non-keratinized epithelium with papillary projec-tions, nodular thickenings, mucous-filled clefts, and “mu-cous lakes. ” In addition, it includes cuboidal basal cells, which are sometimes vacuolated. 9, 10 GOC treatment includes curettage and enucleation, alth-ough some authors believe marginal resection to be a more reliable treatment due to the tendency of the cyst to recur after curettage and enucleation. 10 The aim of this report is to present a case of GOC in a young female patient in the posterior mandibular region, which was quite rare and unusual...|$|R
40|$|Of the {{salivary gland}} <b>tumors,</b> <b>mucoepidermoid</b> {{carcinoma}} {{is probably the}} most difficult to diagnose accurately by aspiration cytology. It is the second most common tumor in the pediatric age group in parotid gland after pleomorphic adenoma and differentiating between both can be diagnostically challenging. We are hereby presenting a case of 13 year old female child with right parotid lesion. The combination of overlapping intermediate and mucus producing cells with abundant background and intracytoplasmic mucin helped us in making the diagnosis of intermediate mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Subsequently total parotidectomy revealed a low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Hence we concluded that abundant mucin with good cellularity can be seen in low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Grading of mucoepidermoid carcinoma is also important to determine the prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Mucoepidermoid {{carcinoma}} is {{the most}} common malignant neoplasm of the salivary glands, and the parotid is the main site of attack. It also occurs in the minor salivary glands from the nasal cavity to the lungs. Nasal location of the mucoepidermoid carcinoma is extremely rare. There is little literature on similar cases. Objective: To report a case of mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the right nasal septum, and cover general aspects of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, therapy, and post-operative follow-up. Case Report: We present a case of a 32 -year-old patient with a history of nasal obstruction, epistaxis and tumoration in the right nasal cavity. The biopsy revealed it was a <b>mucoepidermoid</b> carcinoma. The <b>tumor</b> was surgically removed using endoscopes with associated complementary radiotherapy. The anatomopathological analysis classified it {{with a high degree of}} malignancy. We obtained remission of the symptoms and without subsequent recurrence. Conclusion: Tumor nasal masses should be studied with imaging and histopathology examinations. We may discover rare malignant nasal tumors...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the t(11; 19) (q 21;p 13) {{translocation}} in mucoepidermoid carcinomas and benign Warthin's tumors results in a fusion of the N-terminal CREB-binding domain of the cAMP coactivator TORC 1 (a. k. a. MECT 1 and WAMTP 1) to the Notch coactivator MAML 2. Here we show that a third tumor type, clear cell hidradenoma of the skin, also expresses this gene fusion. RT-PCR analysis of a clear cell hidradenoma with a t(11; 19) (q 21;p 13) translocation revealed expression of a TORC 1 -MAML 2 fusion transcript consisting of exon 1 of TORC 1 fused to exons 2 - 5 of MAML 2. Because the fusion was only detected in a single case, the frequency of this aberration in clear cell hidradenomas remains unknown. These results demonstrate that the t(11; 19) in <b>mucoepidermoid</b> carcinoma, Warthin's <b>tumor,</b> and clear cell hidradenoma targets the same genes and results in identical gene fusions, indicating that at least subgroups of these glandular tumors evolve through activation of the same molecular pathways. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Salivary gland tumors {{constitute}} a highly heterogeneous histopathologic group. There are few epidemiological studies of large series of benign and malignant salivary gland tumors in Brazil. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hospital records of 124 patients with salivary gland tumors diagnosed from January 1993 to December 1999 were reviewed. The patients were analyzed according to gender, age, size, location, and histopathology of the tumor. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients with benign and malignant tumors {{presented with a}} mean age of 47. 7 and 48. 8 years, respectively. The frequency of benign tumors was 80 % (n = 99) and malignant tumors 20 % (n = 25). Tumors were localized in the parotid gland 71 % (n = 88), in the submandibular gland 24 % (n = 30), and in the minor salivary glands 5 % (n = 6). The most common benign tumors were pleomorphic adenoma in 84 % (n = 84) and Warthin's tumor in 13 % (n = 13). Among malignant <b>tumors,</b> <b>mucoepidermoid</b> carcinoma was the most common in 52 % (n = 13), adenoid cystic carcinoma occurred in 20 % (n = 5), and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma was detected in 12 % (n = 3) ...|$|R
40|$|Salivary gland tumors, a {{group of}} histologically diverse benign and {{malignant}} neoplasms, represent a challenging problem for diagnosis and treatment. A specific recurring t(11; 19) (q 21;p 13) translocation is associated with two types of salivary gland <b>tumors,</b> <b>mucoepidermoid</b> carcinomas and Warthin's tumors. This translocation generates a fusion protein comprised of the N-terminal CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) -binding domain of the CREB regulator MECT 1 (Mucoepidermoid carcinoma translocated- 1) and the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain of the Notch coactivator Mastermind-like 2 (MAML 2). Here, we demonstrate that the MECT 1 -MAML 2 fusion protein induces expression of multiple genes known to be CREB transcriptional targets. MECT 1 -MAML 2 was found to bind to CREB, recruit p 300 /CBP into the CREB complex through a binding domain on MAML 2, and constitutively activate CREB-dependent transcription. The transforming activity of MECT 1 -MAML 2 was markedly reduced by blocking CREB DNA binding. Thus, this fusion oncogene mimics constitutive activation of cAMP signaling, by activating CREB directly. This study has identified a novel, critical mechanism of transformation for an oncogene associated very specifically with salivary gland tumors, and identified potential targets {{for the development of}} novel therapies...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Lacrimal sac is {{the closed}} {{upper end of}} the {{nasolacrimal}} duct and has a fibro - elastic wall lined internally by mucosa that is continuous with the conjunctiva through the lacrimal canaliculi and within the nasal mucosa through the nasolacrimal duct. Primary lacrimal sac tumors are rare compared to other orbital <b>tumors.</b> <b>Mucoepidermoid</b> carcinoma is a tumor that contains both neoplastic mucin producing and epidermoid cells. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the LS is very rare. Early treatment of these tumors is esse ntial because they tend to be infiltrating tumors. Multiplanar CT imaging of the paranasal sinuses and orbit is essential for defining the extent of the tumor and for finding evidence of bony destruction of the lacrimal fossa. PRESENTATION OF CASES: In the department of ophthalmology, G. S. L medical college, Rajahmundry, we came across a case of 60 years old male with a history of swelling and lacrimation in right eye since 1 year, provisionally diagnosed to be Lacrimal gland adenoma with suspicious malignan t change. CONCLUSION: it is first of its kind we came across after many years and review of literature reveals various sac malignancies. Methodical approach, correct pathological report and radiological diagnosis are vital to decide the treatment modalitie s like simple excision, radical surgery, radio therapy. From this case we acquired immense knowledge about sac tumours and various treatment modalities and disease course, made us easy to tackle in such cases of sac malignancies in futur...|$|R
40|$|Information on oncogenetic events {{accompanying}} {{salivary gland}} mucoepidermoid carcinoma {{is so far}} limited. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK- 1 and ERK- 2 is strongly correlated to cancer. Using an antibody specific for phosphorylated (active) ERK- 1 /ERK- 2, we examined human salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma samples by immunohistochemistry. The comparison in paired tumor and normal tissue samples showed that phosphorylated ERK- 1 /ERK- 2 immunoreactivity was higher in tumor cells as compared to surrounding normal salivary parenchyma. ERK- 1 /ERK- 2 phosphorylation was observed in ∼ 39 % of <b>mucoepidermoid</b> carcinomas. Those <b>tumors</b> where the ERK- 1 /ERK- 2 pathway was activated had a more aggressive tumor behavior {{as compared to the}} group where this pathway was inactive. The association of ERK- 1 /ERK- 2 phosphorylation to a worse prognosis was independent of histological grade. ERK- 1 /ERK- 2 phosphorylation was associated with increased Ki 67 and cyclin A indexes, which indicated that ERK- 1 /ERK- 2 pathway activation increased tumor cell proliferation. There was no relationship between ERK- 1 /ERK- 2 phosphorylation and HER- 2 /neu or p 16 /INK 4 a protein expression. In conclusion, ERK- 1 /ERK- 2 pathway is active in salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma and this activation is associated to a more aggressive tumor behavior and a higher proliferative activity. These data suggest that deregulation of ERK- 1 /ERK- 2 pathway contributes to mucoepidermoid carcinoma phenotype and, possibly, represents a target for new anticancer drugs...|$|R
40|$|Background: Salivary gland tumors (SGT) {{are rare}} lesions with {{uncertain}} histopathology. One {{of the major}} signaling pathways that participate {{in the development of}} several tumors is protein kinase A. In this pathway, glycogen synthase kinase β (GSK 3 β) and cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB 3) are two genes which are supposed to be down regulated in most human tumors. The expression level of the genes was evaluated in SGT to scrutinize their possible under expression in these tumors. Methods: Forty eight fresh tissue samples were obtained from patients with benign and malignant SGT, including pleomorphic adenoma, warthin’s <b>tumor,</b> <b>mucoepidermoid</b> carcinoma (MEC), salivary duct carcinoma and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. Eight normal samples were used as controls. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to analyze the expression level of interest genes. Results: Data was analyzed by statistical methods. GSK 3 β was downregulate in all samples and all results were statistically significant (P< 0. 05). CREB 3 did not show a significant decrease or increase in its mRNA expression, but the results were significant in MEC and salivary duct carcinoma. Conclusion: GSK 3 β down regulation has been reported in many human tumors. This gene stimulates CREB 3, inducing cell proliferation and oncogenesis. Our findings showed GSK 3 β down regulation; however, CREB 3 expression level was close to normal group. No association between CREB 3 expression and inactivated GSK 3 β could be postulated in SGT.
