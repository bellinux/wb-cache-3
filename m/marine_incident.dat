They were trying to cross the Strait of Otranto, off the southern coast of Italy, in an inflatable boat, heading towards Brindisi, on the Adriatic coast of Apulia. [...] Twenty-eight people died or were declared lost at sea, and there were only eight survivors. For Albanian emigrants, the tragedy had the second highest mortality rate for such events, after the Otranto tragedy of March 1997, when the Albanian ship Kateri i Radës, smuggling clandestine emigrants, was hit by the Italian warship Sibilla, resulting in the death of 84 people.|$|E

50|$|The Fish Factory {{ship the}} Athena caught fire 230 {{miles of the}} {{southwest}} coast of the isles of Scilly. 98 of the 111 crew were forced to abandon ship into the life rafts; these were {{picked up by the}} container ship the Vega. The Athena was then taken under tow to Falmouth Bay, where Cornwall Fire and Rescue's MIRG (<b>Marine</b> <b>Incident</b> Response Group) was then flown out by helicopter to the ship. Once on board, they started to fight the fire in the hold of the ship which contained around 600,000 cardboard boxes. However, {{in the early hours of}} the morning they were forced to evacuate after carbon monoxide levels reached a dangerous level; a couple of firefighters were taken to hospital. The ship is now in control of a salvage team who are finding the best outcome for the ship.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyse <b>marine</b> <b>incident</b> databases in the BSR (Baltic Sea Region). The <b>marine</b> <b>incident</b> data in the region are inhabited by a wide rage of issues, such as limited data accessibility and availability, and the diversity in data quality, structure, amount, accuracy, degree of detail and languages. Preparing for the data analysis is a very cumbersome, labour intensive, time consuming and expensive process. Merging different datasets from different countries into a single dataset is a very difficult process, if not impossible for a complete data merging. The paper provides experiences on how to overcome some of these issues and proposes some suggestions for improvements in the future...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of tanker accidents shows varied degrees {{and forms of}} involvement of local inhabitants at the different stages of specific events. The aim of the paper is to gauge, through a pilot survey, the potential of <b>marine</b> <b>incident</b> information networks among coastal or island populations within an accident setting. The authors review how reactions to tanker accidents of potentially affected populations may {{have an impact on}} the selection, design and implementation of the handling by the authorities of an evolving incident The paper argues that networks such as the Shore Awareness of Vessel Emergencies (S. A. V. E) proposed can eventually create a proactive mechanism to prevent chaotic reactions or disruption/distortion of the optimal response. A pilot survey was conducted to estimate population reactions to shipping accidents with a pollution risk and the willingness to participate in S. A. V. E type networks. The authors process data collected through questionnaires distributed to residents of a major maritime Greek island with a large number of active or retired seafarers. Questionnaire data are analyzed with an emphasis on gauging the degree of confidence in an unofficial but well-organized, network as S. A. V. E which would be based mainly on ad-hoc trained members from targeted parts of the local communities...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{conceptual}} model for analysis of <b>marine</b> <b>incidents</b> reported to the Swedish Maritime Administration (SMA) / SOS database. The model is designed based on a systems approach. The model is theoretically and empirically grounded by combining (i) modelling, and accident and risk analysis techniques and theories; (ii) large amounts of empirical data; (iii) and research experience. The SMA database (1985 - 2008) contains large amounts of <b>marine</b> <b>incidents</b> data organised in ca 6000 cases and 88 variables. The majority of variables are categorical or non-metric variables. Summary statistics are mainly employed for data analysis. The proposed model consists of constructs, variables and the path diagrams of relationships. Several qualitative and quantitative analyses and results presentation approaches are proposed. The model is primarily intended for application to the SMA database. However, the SMA database shares a number of variables in common with other databases in the region as well as the world. The model may assist risk analysts to be more efficient in generating detailed, valid and reliable results for the decision-makers. Application of improved or new methodology has proven in practice to yield benefits - save time and resources whilst maintaining a high level of human safety and environmental and property protection. Risk costs constitute a considerable portion of transport/ logistics costs. The model has both theoretical and practical values. It is largely designed based on the SMA database, which contains some unique data that may not be found elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|The LNG {{consequence}} analysis studies {{related to}} <b>marine</b> <b>incidents</b> are gaining {{prominence in the}} U. S. and some other countries due to the potential increase in LNG trade in the near future. To address the issues of LNG hazards associated with marine transportation, many safety assessment studies have been performed by various companies and organizations. These recently conducted studies related to LNG employ different methodologies and have published varying results. The disparity in results is mainly due to the difference in release sizes, modeling parameter assumptions and modeling tools used in calculating the hazard zone. This paper reviews the modeling approaches used by different companies and organizations. A detailed discussion on critical modeling parameters and assumptions affecting the consequence analysis results are also presented in this paper...|$|R
