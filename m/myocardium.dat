5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} the heart is called the endocardium. It {{is made up of}} a lining of simple squamous epithelium, and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the <b>myocardium</b> with a thin layer of connective tissue. The endocardium, by secreting endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the <b>myocardium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The heart wall {{is made up}} {{of three}} layers: the inner endocardium, middle <b>myocardium</b> and outer epicardium. These are {{surrounded}} by a double-membraned sac called the pericardium.|$|E
5|$|One {{danger of}} {{attempting}} to consume hallucinogenic or other wild mushrooms, especially for novice mushroom hunters, {{is the possibility of}} misidentification with toxic species. In one noted case, an otherwise healthy young Austrian man mistook the poisonous Cortinarius rubellus for P.semilanceata. As a result, he suffered end-stage renal failure, and required a kidney transplant. In another instance, a young man developed cardiac abnormalities similar to those seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the <b>myocardium.</b> A polymerase chain reaction-based test to specifically identity P.semilanceata was reported by Polish scientists in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{half-life}} of cTnI {{in adult}} cardiomyocytes {{is estimated to}} be ~3.2 days and there is a pool of unassembled cardiac TnI in the cytoplasm. Cardiac TnI is exclusively expressed in the <b>myocardium</b> and is thus a highly specific diagnostic marker for cardiac muscle injuries, and cTnI has been universally used as indicator for myocardial infarction. An increased level of serum cTnI also independently predicts poor prognosis of critically ill patients in the absence of acute coronary syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle layer}} of the heart wall is the <b>myocardium,</b> which is the cardiac muscle – a layer of {{involuntary}} striated muscle tissue surrounded by a framework of collagen. The cardiac muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers of the heart, with the outer muscles forming a figure 8 pattern around the atria and around the bases of the great vessels, and inner muscles formining a figure 8 around the two ventricles and proceed toward the apex. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively.|$|E
5|$|In humans, other mammals, and birds, {{the heart}} is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria; and lower left and right {{ventricle}}s. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains {{a small amount of}} fluid. The wall of {{the heart is}} made up of three layers: epicardium, <b>myocardium,</b> and endocardium.|$|E
5|$|The right heart {{collects}} deoxygenated {{blood from}} two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects {{in the right}} and left atrium continuously. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties into the upper back part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and {{to the middle of the}} opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the <b>myocardium</b> to the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.|$|E
25|$|Myocardial {{ischemia}} {{comes about}} when the <b>myocardium</b> (the heart muscle) receives insufficient blood and oxygen to function normally either because of increased oxygen demand by the <b>myocardium</b> or because of decreased supply to the <b>myocardium.</b> This inadequate perfusion of blood and the resulting reduced delivery of oxygen and nutrients are directly correlated to blocked or narrowed blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|The normal {{electrical}} conduction {{system of}} the heart allows the impulse that is generated by the sinoatrial node (SA node) of the heart to be propagated to and stimulate the <b>myocardium</b> (muscular layer of the heart). When the <b>myocardium</b> is stimulated, it contracts. It is the ordered stimulation of the <b>myocardium</b> that allows efficient contraction of the heart, thereby allowing blood to be pumped to the body.|$|E
25|$|By {{acting on}} cardiac muscles (<b>myocardium),</b> they reduce {{the force of}} {{contraction}} of the heart.|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone {{is used in}} transvenous {{screw-in}} cardiac pacing {{leads to}} minimize the inflammatory response of the <b>myocardium.</b> The steroid is released into the <b>myocardium</b> {{as soon as the}} screw is extended and can {{play a significant role in}} minimizing the acute pacing threshold due to the reduction of inflammatory response. The typical quantity present in a lead tip is less than 1.0mg.|$|E
25|$|Myocardial {{perfusion}} imaging (MPI) {{is a form}} {{of functional}} cardiac imaging, used for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. The underlying principle is, under conditions of stress, diseased <b>myocardium</b> receives less blood flow than normal <b>myocardium.</b> MPI is one of several types of cardiac stress test. As a nuclear stress test the average radiation exposure is 9.4 mSV which compared to a typical 2 view Chest X-Ray (.1 mSV) is equivalent to 94 Chest X-Rays.|$|E
25|$|During heart transplant, the {{vagus nerve}} is severed, thus {{removing}} parasympathetic {{influence over the}} <b>myocardium.</b> However, some limited return of sympathetic nerves has been demonstrated in humans.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{congestive}} cardiac {{failure is}} an uncommon but recognized {{side effect of}} imatinib and mice treated with large doses of imatinib show toxic damage to their <b>myocardium.</b>|$|E
25|$|SCN5A {{is mainly}} {{expressed}} in the heart, where expression is abundant in working <b>myocardium</b> and conduction tissue. In contrast, expression is low in the sinoatrial node and atrioventricular node.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{neurogenesis}} {{is also a}} form {{of cellular}} regeneration. For example, hippocampal neuron renewal occurs in normal adult humans at an annual turnover rate of 1.75% of neurons. Cardiac myocyte renewal {{has been found to}} occur in normal adult humans, and at a higher rate in adults following acute heart injury such as infarction. Even in adult <b>myocardium</b> following infarction, proliferation is only found in around 1% of myocytes around the area of injury, which is not enough to restore function of cardiac muscle. However, this may be an important target for regenerative medicine as it implies that regeneration of cardiomyocytes, and consequently of <b>myocardium,</b> can be induced.|$|E
25|$|Impact {{occurring}} {{within a}} specific 10– to 30-millisecond portion of the cardiac cycle. This period occurs in the ascending phase of the T wave, when the ventricular <b>myocardium</b> is repolarizing, moving from systole to diastole (relaxation).|$|E
25|$|The heart {{derives from}} {{embryonic}} mesodermal germ-layer cells that differentiate after gastrulation into mesothelium, endothelium, and <b>myocardium.</b> Mesothelial pericardium forms the outer {{lining of the}} heart. The inner lining of the heart, lymphatic and blood vessels, develop from endothelium.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{the heart}} rate is {{decreased}} while blood pressure is increased, resulting in a net increase in stroke volume, leading to increased tissue perfusion. This causes the <b>myocardium</b> to work more efficiently, with optimized hemodynamics and an improved ventricular function curve.|$|E
25|$|Spontaneous {{conversion}} of ventricular fibrillation {{to a more}} benign rhythm is rare in all but small animals. Defibrillation is the process that converts ventricular fibrillation to a more benign rhythm. This is usually by application of an electric shock to the <b>myocardium</b> and is discussed in detail in the relevant article.|$|E
25|$|In humans, the {{pulmonary}} artery expresses D1, D2, D4, and D5 and receptor subtypes, which {{may account for}} vasodilatory effects of dopamine in the blood. Such receptor subtypes have also been discovered in the epicardium, <b>myocardium,</b> and endocardium of the heart. In rats, D1-like receptors are present on the smooth muscle of the blood vessels in most major organs.|$|E
25|$|Microarray {{analysis}} from one report shows {{a significant decrease}} in myocardial arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) gene expression during the late-stage heart failure. This suggests that the reduced AGAT may correlate with loss of heart function. Increase of AGAT expression in the <b>myocardium</b> after heart failure due to increase in creatine synthesis was associated with favorable outcome.|$|E
25|$|Notch {{signaling}} can {{regulate the}} atrioventricular boundary formation between the AV canal and the chamber <b>myocardium.</b> Studies {{have revealed that}} both loss- and gain-of-function of the Notch pathway results in defects in AV canal development. In addition, the Notch target genes HEY1 and HEY2 are involved in restricting the expression of two critical developmental regulator proteins, BMP2 and Tbx2, to the AV canal.|$|E
25|$|The <b>myocardium</b> thickens and secretes a {{thick layer}} of rich {{extracellular}} matrix containing hyaluronic acid which separates the endothelium. Then mesothelial cells form the pericardium and migrate to form most of the epicardium. Then the heart tube is formed by the endocardium, which is the inner endothelial lining of the heart, and the myocardial muscle wall which is the epicardium that covers the outside of the tube.|$|E
25|$|Automaticity is {{a measure}} of the {{propensity}} of a fiber to initiate an impulse spontaneously. The product of a hypoxic <b>myocardium</b> can be hyperirritable myocardial cells. These may then act as pacemakers. The ventricles are then being stimulated by more than one pacemaker. Scar and dying tissue is inexcitable, but around these areas usually lies a penumbra of hypoxic tissue that is excitable. Ventricular excitability may generate re-entry ventricular arrhythmia.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, {{engineer}} Earl Bakken of Minneapolis, Minnesota, {{produced the}} first wearable external pacemaker {{for a patient}} of C. Walton Lillehei. This transistorized pacemaker, housed in a small plastic box, had controls to permit adjustment of pacing heart rate and output voltage and was connected to electrode leads which passed through {{the skin of the}} patient to terminate in electrodes attached {{to the surface of the}} <b>myocardium</b> of the heart.|$|E
25|$|In {{the acute}} setting, the stroke {{volume of the}} left {{ventricle}} is increased (increased ejection fraction); this happens because of more complete emptying of the heart. However, as it progresses the LV volume increases and the contractile function deteriorates, thus leading to dysfunctional LV {{and a decrease in}} ejection fraction. The increase in stroke volume is explained by the Frank–Starling mechanism, in which increased ventricular pre-load stretches the <b>myocardium</b> such that contractions are more forceful.|$|E
25|$|In {{clinical}} practice, therefore, {{factors that}} would lead to the right conditions to favour such re-entry mechanisms include increased heart size through hypertrophy or dilatation, drugs which alter the length of the refractory period and areas of cardiac disease. Therefore, the substrate of ventricular fibrillation is transient or permanent conduction block. Block due either to areas of damaged or refractory tissue leads to areas of <b>myocardium</b> for initiation and perpetuation of fibrillation through the phenomenon of re-entry.|$|E
25|$|The rhythmic {{electrical}} depolarization {{waves that}} trigger myocardial contraction is myogenic, {{which means that}} they begin in the heart muscle spontaneously and are then responsible for transmitting signals from cell to cell. Myocytes that were obtained in the primitive heart tube, start beating as they connect together by their walls in a syncytium. Myocytes initiate rhythmic electrical activity, before the fusion of the endocardial tubes. The heartbeat begins in the region of the pacemaker which has a spontaneous depolarization time faster than the rest of <b>myocardium.</b>|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{activity}} in the normal human heart begins when a cardiac action potential arises in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which {{is located in the}} right atrium. From there, the electrical stimulus is transmitted via internodal pathways to the atrioventricular (AV) node. After a brief delay at the AV node, the stimulus travels through the bundle of His to the left and right bundle branches and then to the Purkinje fibers and the endocardium at the apex of the heart, then finally to the ventricular <b>myocardium.</b>|$|E
25|$|These micro RNAs have pivotal {{roles in}} {{development}} and physiology of muscle tissues including the heart. MiR-1 {{is known to}} be involved in important role in heart diseases such as hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias. Studies have shown that MiR-1 is an important regulator of heart adaption after ischemia or ischaemic stress and it is upregulated in the remote <b>myocardium</b> of patients with myocardial infarction. Also MiR-1 is downregulated in myocardial infarcted tissue compared to healthy heart tissue. Plasma levels of MiR-1 {{can be used as a}} sensitive biomarker for myocardial infarction.|$|E
25|$|If the fibrous cap {{separating}} a soft atheroma {{from the}} bloodstream within the artery ruptures, tissue fragments are exposed and released. These tissue fragments are very clot-promoting, containing collagen and tissue factor; they activate platelets and activate {{the system of}} coagulation. The result is {{the formation of a}} thrombus (blood clot) overlying the atheroma, which obstructs blood flow acutely. With the obstruction of blood flow, downstream tissues are starved of oxygen and nutrients. If this is the <b>myocardium</b> (heart muscle) angina (cardiac chest pain) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) develops.|$|E
25|$|Parvoviruses {{can cause}} disease in some animals, {{including}} starfish and humans. Because the viruses require actively dividing cells to replicate, {{the type of}} tissue infected varies with {{the age of the}} animal. The gastrointestinal tract and lymphatic system can be affected at any age, leading to vomiting, diarrhea and immunosuppression but cerebellar hypoplasia is only seen in cats that were infected in the womb or at less than two weeks of age, and disease of the <b>myocardium</b> is seen in puppies infected between the ages of three and eight weeks.|$|E
25|$|ST {{elevation}} myocardial infarctions {{have different}} characteristic ECG findings {{based on the}} amount of time elapsed since the MI first occurred. The earliest sign is hyperacute T waves, peaked T-waves due to local hyperkalemia in ischemic <b>myocardium.</b> This then progresses over a period of minutes to elevations of the ST segment by at least 1nbsp&mm. Over a period of hours, a pathologic Q wave may appear and the T wave will invert. Over a period of days the ST elevation will resolve. Pathologic q waves generally will remain permanently.|$|E
25|$|The first {{clinical}} implantation into a human of a fully implantable pacemaker was in 1958 at the Karolinska Institute in Solna, Sweden, using a pacemaker {{designed by}} Rune Elmqvist and surgeon Åke Senning, connected to electrodes {{attached to the}} <b>myocardium</b> of the heart by thoracotomy. The device failed after three hours. A second device was then implanted which lasted for two days. The world's first implantable pacemaker patient, Arne Larsson, went on to receive 26 different pacemakers during his lifetime. He died in 2001, {{at the age of}} 86, outliving the inventor as well as the surgeon.|$|E
25|$|Radiopharmacology or {{medicinal}} radiochemistry is radiochemistry {{applied to}} medicine {{and thus the}} pharmacology of radiopharmaceuticals (medicinal radiocompounds, that is, pharmaceutical drugs that are radioactive). Radiopharmaceuticals {{are used in the}} field of nuclear medicine as radioactive tracers in medical imaging and in therapy for many diseases (for example, brachytherapy). Many radiopharmaceuticals use technetium-99m (Tc-99m) which has many useful properties as a gamma-emitting tracer nuclide. In the book Technetium a total of 31 different radiopharmaceuticals based on Tc-99m are listed for imaging and functional studies of the brain, <b>myocardium,</b> thyroid, lungs, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, skeleton, blood and tumors.|$|E
