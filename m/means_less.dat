5|$|Grand Coulee Dam is a {{concrete}} gravity dam on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington, built to produce hydroelectric power and provide irrigation water. Constructed between 1933 and 1942, Grand Coulee originally {{had only two}} powerhouses. The third powerhouse, completed in 1974 to increase energy production, makes Grand Coulee the largest power station in the United States by nameplate-capacity at 6,809 MW. However, in terms of yearly power production, Grand Coulee places fifth {{after a number of}} nuclear facilities to the south, like Palo Verde west of Phoenix. This is because river flow varies throughout the year. For example, while the dam may generate at nameplate-capacity in the spring, decreased river flow in the fall <b>means</b> <b>less</b> power can be generated the rest of the year, resulting in a lower capacity factor.|$|E
5|$|These small {{whales are}} also {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic whales and calves. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Whales lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. This however <b>means</b> <b>less</b> room around the breathing hole as the ice slowly closes the gap. When out at sea, whales dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas. Polar bear attacks on belugas and narwhals are usually successful in winter, but rarely inflict any damage in summer.|$|E
25|$|The {{machinability}} {{of rubber}} and other soft materials improves {{by using a}} very low temperature coolant, such as liquid carbon dioxide. The low temperatures chill the material prior to cutting so that it cannot deform or stick to the cutting edge. This <b>means</b> <b>less</b> wear on the tools and easier machining.|$|E

25|$|In the PLAN, {{artillery}} {{takes the}} form of anti-ship guns and anti-aircraft guns. Anti-ship guns are typically found on destroyers and cruisers, with smaller versions on frigates. Smaller ships utilize torpedoes for anti-ship weaponry. The increasing use of missiles <b>means</b> <b>less</b> attention is paid to pure anti-ship weapons. The PLAN never possessed battleships or battlecruisers, and the use of a ship's main guns is mostly in standoff capacity, as they have never engaged in close-shore support from cruisers or destroyers.|$|E
25|$|Luminous {{efficacy}} is {{the measure}} of how much light is produced versus how much energy is consumed. HID burners give higher efficacy than halogen lamps. The highest-intensity halogen lamps, H9 and HIR1, produce 2100 to 2530 lumens from approximately 70 watts at 13.2 volts. A D2S HID burner produces 3200 lumens from approximately 42 watts during stable operation. The reduced power consumption <b>means</b> <b>less</b> fuel consumption, with resultant less CO2 emission per vehicle fitted with HID lighting (1.3 g/km assuming that 30% of engine running time is with the lights on).|$|E

25|$|In {{parallel}} with the classic CANDU design, experimental variants were being developed. WR-1, located at the AECL's Whiteshell Laboratories in Pinawa, Manitoba, used vertical pressure tubes and organic oil as the primary coolant. The oil used has a higher boiling point than water, allowing the reactor to operate at higher temperatures and lower pressures than a conventional reactor. WR-1's outlet temperature was about 490C compared to the CANDU 6's nominal 310C, which <b>means</b> <b>less</b> cooling fluid is needed to remove {{the same amount of}} heat, resulting in a smaller and less expensive core. The higher temperatures also result in more efficient conversion to steam, and ultimately, electricity. WR-1 operated successfully for many years, and promised a significantly higher efficiency than water-cooled versions.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, Stuart Levine of Variety {{reviewed}} {{the performances of}} the three cast members nominated in the Outstanding Supporting Actress category. [...] "The ladies of Grey's Anatomy dominate the category, and it'd be far from a stretch to say {{at least two of}} those women rose to high dramatics last season", commented Levine, while praising Sandra Oh for her portrayal of Cristina Yang who endured a tumultuous seasoning relationship, seeing her trepidation at spending a life together with the man she loved. He regarded the appearances of Chandra Wilson as more subdued, though [...] "by no <b>means</b> <b>less</b> well-executed". He deemed Miranda Bailey a rock, being the most level-headed character on the show with a right thing to say in any situation. He expressed admiration towards Chandra Wilson, by describing her as being [...] "flashy and over the top", which he considers better than being consistently good. Considering Heigl's chances of winning the Emmy, Levine assessed of her performance, by remarking the slight difficulty she has in reaching each emotional state Izzie Stevens has to go through: [...] "Showrunner Shonda Rhimes puts {{a lot of pressure on}} Heigl to carry many intense storylines, and she's up to the challenge." [...] However, he also noted that Izzie's irrational actions during crisis situations may be bothering.|$|E

It would also <b>mean</b> <b>less</b> regulation and less subsidization to market participants, such as healthcare providers, insurers, and healthcare consumers. Its results would increase competition among healthcare providers and insurers, would provide more choices for healthcare consumers, and would lower healthcare expenditures. For example, {{the price for}} LASIK surgery has decreased to as low as $ 200 per eye in some areas, dropping from as high as $ 4000 per eye a few years ago. Government policies induce price and service competition among service providers to mitigate increasing healthcare expenditures.|$|R
2500|$|Such spinners {{generally}} {{buy their}} fibres pre-washed and carded, {{in the form}} of roving, sliver, or batts. This <b>means</b> <b>less</b> work for the spinners, as {{they do not have to}} wash out the lanolin. Spinners then have available predyed fibre, or blends of fibres, which are hard to create when the wool is still in the grease. As machine carders cannot card wool in the grease, pre-carded yarn generally is not spun in the grease. Some spinners use spray-on lanolin-like products to get the same feel of spinning in the grease with carded fibre.|$|E

[...] "In looking at the research {{this may be because}} over the first ten years of Valuegenesis research, fewer young people were reading their Bibles and Ellen White.

2500|$|For certain operations, such as Cesarean section, or in hypovolemic {{patients}} or patients with minimal cardiac reserve, the anesthesia provider may aim to provide [...] "light anesthesia" [...] and should discuss {{this with the}} patient to warn them. During such circumstances, consciousness and recall may occur because judgments of depth of anesthesia are not precise. The anesthesia provider must weigh {{the need to keep}} the patient safe and stable with the goal of preventing awareness. Sometimes, it is necessary to provide lighter anesthesia in order to preserve the life of the patient.

[...] The work is Tismăneanu's study into the avatars of Marxism within the Eastern Bloc, and {{a contribution to}} both Kremlinology and Cold War studies.

2500|$|Although {{climate change}} is {{estimated}} to have more serious effects on wildlife {{over the next few}} decades, there is evidence that sea turtles have already been affected. [...] With the increase of temperature, polar ice has melted and has led to the rise of sea levels. [...] This rise in sea levels has been a factor in the loss of beach, which for sea turtles <b>means</b> <b>less</b> nesting area. [...] Global warming has been associated with severe weather, which could mean harsh and numerous storms that erode beaches and flood nests. [...] As the overall temperature of the earth rises, so does the temperature of the sand, which diminishes the rate of hatchling survival. [...] The temperature of the sand also affects gender, as higher temperatures have been shown to yield more female hatchlings. [...] Changes in climate also influence currents and change the number and location of prey species. [...] Water that is too warm can also cause coral bleaching, which is detrimental to reefs that are essential to certain species, such as the Hawksbill sea turtle.|$|E
