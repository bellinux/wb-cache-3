40|$|The {{suprachiasmatic nucleus}} (SCN) is {{generally}} considered the master clock, independently driving all circadian rhythms. We recently demonstrated the SCN receives metabolic and cardiovascular feedback adeptly altering its neuronal activity. In the present study, we show that <b>microcuts</b> effectively removing SCN-arcuate nucleus (ARC) interconnectivity in Wistar rats result {{in a loss of}} rhythmicity in locomotor activity, corticosterone levels, and body temperature in constant dark (DD) conditions. Elimination of these reciprocal connections did not affect SCN clock gene rhythmicity but did cause the ARC to desynchronize. Moreover, unilateral SCN lesions with contralateral retrochiasmatic <b>microcuts</b> resulted in identical arrhythmicity, proving that for the expression of physiological rhythms this reciprocal SCN-ARC interaction is essential. The unaltered SCN c-Fos expression following glucose administration in disconnected animals as compared to a significant decrease in controls demonstrates the importance of the ARC as metabolic modulator of SCN neuronal activity. Together, these results indicate that the SCN is more than an autonomous clock, and forms an essential component of a larger network controlling homeostasis. The present novel findings illustrate how an imbalance between SCN and ARC communication through circadian disruption could be involved in the etiology of metabolic disorder...|$|R

40|$|Cardiovascular stents are {{biomedical}} {{devices for}} the treatment of stenosis problem in the vascular system. Stenosis can be considered as the narrowing of the vessel in a way that creates a block or contraction to blood flow. In order to overcome such blockings, stents are placed and expanded in the narrowing location. Stent manufacturing is vastly done by laser beam machining and requires a good accuracy and control of the process to be successful. Recent studies have assessed nanosecond-pulsed lasers for efficient production in terms of productivity and quality. To achieve the required properties with regard to burr and dross removal, edge rounding and surface finishing, currently chemical etching followed by electrochemical polishing is applied after laser machining. Both from the perspective of process control, speed and repeatability as well as biocompatibility, these chemical finishing processes, using concentrated acids, are far from optimal. Plasma electrolytic polishing (PeP) can provide an alternative, using biocompatible, aqueous solutions and high DC voltages of u > 200 V to establish a vapour skin around the workpiece which leads to the generation of an atmospheric plasma. Here, electrochemical and electrothermal reactions take place which remove burr and dross and smoothen the workpieces' surface. Roughness values of Ra ≥ 0. 02 μm have been achieved. This work presents the study of a novel stent manufacturing route for producing permanent stents in AISI 316 L stainless steel. The stent mesh was <b>microcut</b> employing a ns-pulsed fiber laser.

The characteristics of the cutting forces were extracted and analyzed using statistical and spectrum analysis methods. A series of cutting experiments were done on a copper alloy and copper single crystals with different crystallographic orientations. Experimental results indicate that there exists a dominant frequency component and a periodicity of fluctuation of the cutting forces per workpiece revolution in the diamond turning of a single crystal material. The periodicity is closely related to the crystallographic orientation of the material being cut. As the depth of cut increases, the influence of crystallographic orientation of the single-crystal materials on <b>microcutting</b> forces is found to be more pronounced. Moreover, the cutting force ratio between the mean thrust force and the mean cutting force is found to vary with the depth of cut, and a large ratio was observed at a small depth of cut. These findings help to explain quantitatively the periodic fluctuations of <b>microcutting</b> forces (and hence the materials-induced vibration) in ultraprecision diamond turning, which are not encountered in conventional machining.

Therefore, this work presents an evaluation of specific work of fracture for sharp and rounded-edged tools, knowing cutting forces and shear angles from LS-DYNA simulations of orthogonal <b>microcutting</b> of low-carbon AISI 1215 steel. The R was also evaluated as a function of process parameters such as cutting speed, rake angle, tool edge radius, and uncut chip thickness, so as to illustrate the effect of these variables on the magnitude of R and contribution of R to the specific cutting energy or size effect. It is observed that R increases with an increase in uncut chip thickness, whereas it decreases with an increase in cutting speed, rake angle, and tool edge radius. U-R defines the contribution of fracture to the specific cutting energy (U) due to specific work of fracture R.

Laser <b>microcutting</b> is the industrially accepted method for stent manufacturing. However, the laser-material interaction should be well investigated to control the quality characteristics of the <b>microcutting</b> process that concern the surface roughness, chemical composition, and microstructure of the final device. Despite the recent developments in industrial laser systems, a universal laser source that can be manipulated flexibly in terms of process parameters is far from reality.

This work approaches the laser <b>microcutting</b> of AZ 31 Mg alloy {{from the perspective of}} a comparative study to evaluate the machining capabilities in continuous wave (CW), ns- and fs-pulsed regimes. Three industrial grade machining systems were compared to reach a benchmark in machining quality, productivity, and ease of postprocessing. The results confirmed that moving toward the ultrashort pulse domain the machining quality increases, but the need for postprocessing remains. The real advantage of ultrashort pulsed machining was the ease in postprocessing and maintaining geometrical integrity of the stent mesh after chemical etching. Resultantly, the overall production cycle time was shortest for fs-pulsed laser system, despite the fact that CW laser system provided highest cutting speed...|$|E

Abrasive wear tests using a pin test on alumina paper were carried out, using abrasive sizes between 16 mu m and 192 mu m. Retained austenite content of the matrix was determined by X-ray diffraction. The wear surface of samples and the alumina paper were examined by scanning electron microscopy for identifying the wear micromechanism. The results show that at lower abrasive sizes the mass loss was similar for the iron with different austenite contents. However, at higher abrasive sizes the samples with higher retained austenite content presented higher abrasion resistance. For lower abrasive sizes tested, samples with higher and lower retained austenite content both presented <b>microcutting.</b> On the other hand, the main wear micromechanism for the samples with higher retained austenite content and higher abrasive sizes was microploughing. The samples with lower retained austenite content presented <b>microcutting</b> and wedge formation at higher abrasive sizes. Higher abrasive size induced more <b>microcutting</b> in samples with lower retained austenite. The iron with lower retained austenite content presented wider grooves for the different abrasive sizes measured.
