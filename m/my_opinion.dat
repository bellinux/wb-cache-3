5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. I owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> and the cause was this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating <b>my</b> <b>opinion.</b> I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.|$|E
5|$|His public enemies, {{even the}} men who {{directed}} the fatal shot, ne'er spoke or wrote of him without expressions of marked respect; those whom he commanded loved him even to idolatry; and I, his associate and commander, fail in words adequate to express <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> of his great worth. I feel assured that every patriot in America, on hearing this sad news, will {{feel a sense of}} personal loss, and the country generally will realize that we have lost, not only an able military leader, but a man who, had he survived, was qualified to heal the national strife which has been raised by designing and ambitious men.|$|E

5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} I have not read, but, from the little that I have seen, I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd Georgeâ€™s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E
60|$|On this head I must {{be allowed}} to submit what <b>my</b> <b>opinions</b> have ever been, and {{somewhat}} at large.|$|R

25|$|In <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> the {{two great}} players were jealous of one another. There were times in the series when I felt {{it was not so}} much a battle between England and Australia as a battle between Bradman and Hammond.|$|E
25|$|Fear in <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> is a {{state of}} drunkenness. And when men are in that state when the fear impulse takes a hold...he loses all reason, sense of values, and is not liable, or at least should not be held {{accountable}} for acts perpetrated when thus possessed.|$|E
25|$|The First Rule of Logic {{pertains}} to the mind's presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic, presuppositions, for instance, that truth and the real do not depend on yours or <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough (see below). He describes such ideas as, collectively, hopes which, in particular cases, one is unable seriously to doubt.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I pity you,' said Anne. 'If everyone, {{or indeed}} if {{half the world}} were like her, I should be more violent in <b>my</b> <b>opinions</b> than Lizzie is.' ...|$|R

60|$|IT {{is nearly}} eight years since {{this book was}} first published. I present it, {{unaltered}}, in the Cheap Edition; and such of <b>my</b> <b>opinions</b> as it expresses, are quite unaltered too.|$|R
25|$|For {{political}} reasons, Pakistan claims {{victory in}} the 1965 war. In <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> the war ended {{in a kind of}} stalemate. We were in a position of strength. Had the war continued for a few more days, we would have gained a decisive victory. I advised then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri not to agree for ceasefire. But I think he was under pressure from the United Nations and some countries.|$|E
25|$|To cluster his {{airplanes}} in {{such groups}} and positions {{that in an}} emergency they could not take the air for several hours, and to keep his antiaircraft ammunition so stored {{that it could not}} be promptly and immediately available, and to use his best reconnaissance system, radar, only for a very small fraction of the day and night, in <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> betrayed a misconception of his real duty which was almost beyond belief....|$|E
25|$|Here in <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> is {{the only}} imaginative prose-writer of the {{slightest}} value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, {{it will probably be}} admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, worth more than a single glance; and after all, he is a completely negative, unconstructive, amoral writer, a mere Jonah, a passive acceptor of evil, a sort of Whitman among the corpses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor am I accustomed, sir, to be {{interfered}} with in my official duties. I speak as a magistrate, Sir Lothian, but I am {{always ready to}} sustain <b>my</b> <b>opinions</b> as a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suits me, forsooth! Yes; he has {{pretended to}} make <b>my</b> <b>opinions</b> and tastes his own. He has humoured me for good reasons. I think, Polly, you and I will bid him good-by." ...|$|R

25|$|For Hitchcock, the actors, {{like the}} props, {{were part of}} the film's setting, as he said to Truffaut:In <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> the chief {{requisite}} for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be utilised and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.|$|E
25|$|You have {{misunderstood}} {{the whole}} article, because you {{jumped to the}} conclusion that it denies the existence of God. There is no such denial, what you call God I call Nature, the Supreme intelligence that rules matter. All the article states is that it is doubtful in <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came, scattered amongst the cells of which we are made.|$|E
25|$|Now {{and then}} I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{are the most}} respectable critics of my {{position}} on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn {{is by far the}} first that comes to mind. His book, Race, IQ and Jensen (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.|$|E
60|$|Afterwards I conversed {{with the}} said Quick about this same matter, repeating to him <b>my</b> <b>opinions,</b> {{to which the}} Sergeant listened with the {{deference}} which he was always kind enough to show to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "So far {{as their}} safety is concerned," [...] he said, [...] "I have passed <b>my</b> word. <b>My</b> <b>opinions</b> are <b>my</b> own. Will you tell me, Baron, at what time you propose to release me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you wish}} {{to keep it a}} secret from me, too? I own that, in my eyes, the tribe of a red-skin goes a good way in making up <b>my</b> <b>opinions</b> of the man. Is he a Winnebagoe?" ...|$|R
25|$|On December 6, 2006, Deming {{testified before}} the US Senate {{committee}} on the Environmental and Public Works, concluding that The amount of climatic warming {{that has taken place}} in the past 150 years is poorly constrained, and its cause--human or natural--is unknown. There is no sound scientific basis for predicting future climate change with any degree of certainty. If the climate does warm, {{it is likely to be}} beneficial to humanity rather than harmful. In <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> it would be foolish to establish national energy policy on the basis of misinformation and irrational hysteria.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, I cannot {{find in the}} Canadian Bill of Rights {{anything}} clearly {{showing that}} Parliament intended to establish concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms some overriding general principles to be enforced by the courts against the clearly expressed will of Parliament in statutes existing at the time. In <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> Parliament did nothing more than instruct the courts to construe and apply those laws {{in accordance with the}} principles enunciated in the Bill on the basis that the recognized rights and freedoms did exist, not that they were to be brought into existence by the courts.|$|E
25|$|I {{understand}} {{the reorganization of}} the Lake Shore has been affected upon favorable terms, but have never {{had an opportunity to}} see the plan. I would every strongly recommend the purchase or least of the western divisions of the system, if favorable terms may be obtained. I would also advise the purchase of the Spokane Branch, if the property could be acquired upon satisfactory terms, which in <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> would be based upon the value of that portion of the line within the city limits over which the Great Northern now gains access, including any liens the bonds may constitute upon the depot property, and the salvage value of the rails upon the remaining portion of the branch.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{really looks}} as if staunchness were one of my virtues; but you see I venture to act on <b>my</b> <b>opinions</b> without paying much {{attention}} to what other people think. After all, that would be foolish, wouldn't it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Here are <b>my</b> <b>opinions</b> {{from the}} study {{conducted}} for the patent case. The first microprocessor in a commercial product was the Four Phase Systems AL1. The first commercially available (sold as a component) microprocessor was the 4004 from Intel.|$|R
30|$|I {{thought that}} {{modeling}} is {{waste of time}} before this course, because I didnâ€™t believe that my students could be creative in this way. <b>My</b> <b>opinions</b> changed after this course, because we saw some examples of experiments including scientific practices.|$|R
