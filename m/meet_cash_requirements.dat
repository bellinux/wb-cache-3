It includes the availability of cash or equivalent that enables people to adopt different livelihood strategies. In a pastoral community, {{an important component of}} financial capital is livestock, which acts as a store of wealth and buffer against bad times (Ellis 2000). Financial capital is made up of available stocks (anything that can be liquidated to <b>meet</b> <b>cash</b> <b>requirements)</b> and regular inflows of cash (income from farm produce sales, wages and remittances from household members working away from the homestead).|$|E
40|$|Using simultaneous-equation models, {{this paper}} {{examines}} {{whether there is}} interdependence between smallholder’s net market positions in crop and live animals markets under mixed crop–livestock system. Household level data collected in 2009 from 1075 sample households in 10 districts of Ethiopia are used for the analyses. Results confirm the existence of interdependence between household’s net positions in crop and live animals markets and, relatively, the net position of households in the live animals market is dictated by their net position in the crop market. The interdependence between the two market positions shows that households stock live animal asset through selling surplus crops produced and finance crop purchase through live animals sales. The relative strength of the net market position in crop markets shows that prior to their involvement in live animal market, farm households analyse their position in crop production, consumption, marketable surplus, and the household’s ability to <b>meet</b> <b>cash</b> <b>requirements</b> through crop sale. Thus, policies/strategies enhancing smallholders’ participation in crop and live animals markets in mixed crop–livestock system should {{pay attention to the}} production and marketing of both commodities simultaneously.

40|$|The {{transition}} into homeownership {{is becoming increasingly}} difficult for first-home buyers. In this paper we measure the deposit requirements and the transaction costs associated with purchasing {{a home for the}} first time, and whether a reduction in stamp duty obligations will help potential first-home owners&# 039; bridge the gap between their savings and the up-front <b>cash</b> <b>requirements</b> that must be met on purchase. We conclude that those with low-to-moderate permanent earnings have particularly large gaps between savings and up-front <b>cash</b> <b>requirements.</b> A key finding is that stamp duties typically account for 23 per cent of total up-front <b>cash</b> <b>requirements,</b> and their formal incidence among potential homebuyers is highly regressive. If all potential homeowners were granted exemption from stamp duties, we estimate that <b>cash</b> <b>requirement</b> gaps are immediately bridged for only 9 % of those who cannot currently <b>meet</b> up-front <b>cash</b> <b>requirements</b> from savings...|$|R

The issues are: 1. Whether it is appropriate for the enterprise to record income from death benefits on COLI policies on an actuarially expected basis rather than upon the actual death of the insured 2. Whether it is appropriate to value the policies for accounting purposes at the net loan value (the maximum amount that the enterprise can contractually borrow against the policy) if the enterprise intends to retain the COLI policies in force until the death of the insured and borrow against the policy to <b>meet</b> any <b>cash</b> <b>requirements.</b> Copyright © 1988, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistributio...|$|R

Indeed, Bramer Bank had been experiencing large withdrawals of deposits placing it in a precarious liquidity situation in an alleged Ponzi scheme. [...] A situation that was further worsened by Bramer Bank’s difficulty to raise funds on the interbank market. As a result, it was relying on overnight facilities from the Bank of Mauritius from March 6, 2015 in order to <b>meet</b> daily <b>cash</b> flow <b>requirements.</b> This liquidity crisis also affected Bramer Banking Corporation's sister company BAI Co.

40|$|The {{downsizing}} of the Department of Energy`s (Department) facilities as {{a result}} of the end of the Cold War had a negative impact on communities that were heavily dependent on the Department`s operations for economic stability. To lessen the impact, the Department provided financial assistance to local communities through Federal grants and cooperative agreements. The objective of this audit was to determine whether funding provided for economic development at the Mount Plant was used for the Department`s intended purposes. Overall, the authors found that the Department`s funds were used for their intended purposes. However, contrary to Federal regulations, the Department advanced the City of Miamisburg, Ohio (City) $ 2. 6 million more than the minimum funds needed to <b>meet</b> immediate <b>cash</b> <b>requirements,</b> and the City kept the majority of the funds in non-interest bearing accounts. The funds were provided to fulfill commitments previously made to the City by senior Department officials, and the Department did not require the City to comply with Federal regulations or grant terms regarding cash advances. As a result, the City held a cash advance of $ 2. 6 million for more than a year and remitted only $ 10, 000 in interest earned on the advance. Management agreed with the finding and recommendations and initiated the appropriate corrective actions...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to focus on the elements, objectives, goals and importance of cash management; and also to examine the sources of revenue and cost effective collections for local governments. The elements of cash management are identified as establishing bank relations, preparing cash flow statements, estimating collection receipts and analyzing cash flow and preparing a budget. Amongst the objectives of cash management is to ensure availability of cash resources at all times for efficient and unconstrained implementation of the annual budget. The primary goals of a good cash management system are to maintain adequate cash at hand to <b>meet</b> the daily <b>cash</b> <b>requirements</b> of the local government while maximizing the amount available for investment and to obtain the maximum earnings on invested funds while ensuring their safety. The local governments obtain their revenue through internal and external sources, the external sources of revenue includes federal statutory allocations and loans obtained from financial institutions and other agencies; while among the internal sources are revenue from market fees, fees collected from motor parks, street hawking fees, shop fees and other miscellaneous sources. Some of the cost effective methods of revenue collections are contracting out of revenue collections to private collection agency, designating collection points for convenience, application of e-collection method where the local governments device a means of allowing tax payers to pay their taxes online. It is recommended that proper management of funds, efficient accounting and auditing system is necessary for proper cash management...|$|R
40|$|Any {{major new}} capital investment, {{such as the}} {{purchase}} of land, machinery, buildings or animals, can have a large effect on cash flows, particulary if additonal capital is borrowed to finance the purchase. Borrowed capital requires principal and interest payments. The questions to answer before making the new investment is: Will the investment generate enough additional <b>cash</b> income to <b>meet</b> its additional <b>cash</b> <b>requirements?</b> In other words, is the investment financially feasible, as opposed to economically profitable? Farms with high production efficiency are more successful due to three factors. High levels of production result in: (1) low cost per unit of output, (2) {{with an increase in}} the effective size of the farm business, and (3) with an increased effectiveness of labor and machinery. The high level of production provides a simple and effective method of increasing farm size. Farms with high agricultural productivity and high levels of productivity per head resulting in a large volume of business compared with farms with the same size but with lower production levels. This additional business volume is the result of working more effectively, without increasing the surface of the land or the size of the activities. The main methods of raising the level of productivity of livestock production are: i) selection and improvement of breed; ii) choice of a balanced food ration in relation to the level of production, iii) sheltering conditions and health care, iv) appropriate and timely nutrition and; v) a good combination between use of pasture and concentrated food.
