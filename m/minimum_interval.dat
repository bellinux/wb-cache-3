5|$|On 16 December 1982, B-52G 57-6482, {{assigned}} to 328th BS, 93rd BW, Castle AFB, California, was {{participating in a}} <b>Minimum</b> <b>Interval</b> Take-Off (MITO; 12 seconds between each aircraft on takeoff) from Mather AFB, CA. The incident aircraft was in the number two position of a three-ship group. The B-52G was equipped with water injection to give additional thrust for take-off, but the lead aircraft was not equipped with this system. After takeoff the aircraft began to rapidly overtake the lead, so the pilot retarded the throttles rapidly, causing flameout of four engines. The aircraft then stalled and crashed. Nine crew members were killed.|$|E
5|$|In late 1902, the PC plans {{collapsed}} after {{a falling}} {{out between the}} scheme's promoters led to {{a crucial part of}} the planned route coming under the control of a rival, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), which withdrew it from parliamentary consideration. With the PC scheme out of the way, the CLR resubmitted its bill in 1903, although consideration was again held up by Parliament's establishment of a Royal Commission on London Traffic tasked to assess the manner in which transport in London should be developed. While the Commission deliberated, any review of bills for new lines and extensions was postponed, so the CLR withdrew the bill. The CLR briefly re-presented the bill for the 1905 parliamentary session but withdrew it again, before making an agreement with the UERL in October 1905 that neither company would submit a bill for an east–west route in 1906. The plan was then dropped as the new trains with driving positions at both ends made it possible for the CLR to reduce the <b>minimum</b> <b>interval</b> between trains to two minutes without building the loop.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1958, a B-47B Stratojet crashed {{while taking}} off from Loring, killing all four crewmembers on board. The plane belonged to a unit at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando, Florida. The plane was {{described}} as having reached {{two-thirds of the way}} down the runway, when it veered sharply to the right, eventually crashing 400 feet north of the runway. On 25 November 1958, a KC-135 Stratotanker of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron crashed on takeoff roughly in the same area as the B-47 three days before. Two crewmembers were thrown to safety by the impact of the crash. The Air Force stated that after a four-hour mission, the crewmembers were practicing taking off and landing on the runway. On 18 November 1960, a KC-135 crashed upon landing at Loring, killing one and injuring sixteen others. The plane landed after a six-and-a-half-hour training mission, veered off {{to the left of the}} runway, and skidded three thousand feet while on fire. Surviving crewmembers were able to use the emergency chutes to evacuate the plane safely. On 9 May 1962, six crewmembers of a KC-135 were killed when their plane crashed during takeoff into a surrounding marsh, about fifteen hundred feet north of the runway. On 4 January 1965, four crewmembers were killed three miles north of Loring when their KC-135 crashed into the ground after takeoff. On 5 September 1969, a B-52 Stratofortress crashed approximately three miles north of the runway after taking off. Seven men were killed, including six crewmembers, during a <b>Minimum</b> <b>Interval</b> Takeoff drill. On 4 October 1989 a KC-135 crash killed all 4 crewmembers. The jet, which crashed about 2.4 miles off the TransCanada Highway in New Brunswick, was attempting to land at Loring.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA graph G is {{a proper}} {{interval}} graph if {{there exists a}} mapping r from V(G) to the class of closed intervals of the real line with the properties that for distinct vertices v and w we have r(v) ⋔ r(w) ≠ Ø {{if and only if}} v and w are adjacent and neither of the intervals r(v), r(w) contain the other. We prove that for every proper interval graph G, |V(G) | ⩾ 2 c(G) - c(K(G)), where c(G) is the number of cliques of G and K(G) is the clique graph of G. If the equality is verified we call G a <b>minimum</b> proper <b>interval</b> graph. The main result is that the restriction to the class of <b>minimum</b> proper <b>interval</b> graphs of clique mapping G → K(G) is a bijection (up to isomorphism) onto the class of proper interval graphs.

2500|$|Purim Meshulash, or the {{three-fold}} Purim, is {{a somewhat}} rare calendric occurrence that affects how Purim is observed in Jerusalem (and, in theory at least, {{in other cities}} that were surrounded by a wall in ancient times). When Shushan Purim (Adar 15) falls on Sabbath, the holiday is celebrated {{over a period of}} three days. The megilla reading and distribution of charity takes place on the Friday (Adar 14), which day is called Purim dePrazos. The Al ha-Nissim prayer is only recited on Sabbath (Adar 15), which is Purim itself. [...] The Torah portion for Purim is read for maftir, while the haftarah is the same as read the previous Shabbat, Parshat Zachor. On Sunday (Adar 16), called Purim Meshullash, mishloach manot are sent and the festive Purim meal is held. The <b>minimum</b> <b>interval</b> between occurrences of Purim Meshulash is three years (1974 to 1977; 2005 to 2008). The maximum interval is 20 years (1954 to 1974; will occur again 2025 to 2045). Other possible intervals are four years (1977 to 1981; 2001 to 2005; 2021 to 2025); seven years (1994 to 2001); and 13 years (1981 to 1994; 2008 to 2021).|$|E
60|$|One {{imagines the}} parties to a {{projected}} marriage first obtaining licenses which will testify that these conditions are satisfied. From {{the point of view}} of the theoretical Utopian State, these licenses are the feature of primary importance. Then, no doubt, that universal register at Paris would come into play. As a matter of justice, there must be no deception between the two people, and the State will ensure that in certain broad essentials this is so. They would have to communicate their joint intention to a public office after their personal licenses were granted, and each would be supplied with a copy of the index card of the projected mate, on which would be recorded his or her age, previous marriages, legally important diseases, offspring, domiciles, public appointments, criminal convictions, registered assignments of property, and so forth. Possibly it might be advisable to have a little ceremony for each party, for each in the absence of the other, in which this record could be read over in the presence of witnesses, together with some prescribed form of address of counsel in the matter. There would then be a reasonable interval for consideration and withdrawal on the part of either spouse. In the event of the two people persisting in their resolution, they would after this <b>minimum</b> <b>interval</b> signify as much to the local official and the necessary entry would be made in the registers. These formalities would be quite independent of any religious ceremonial the contracting parties might choose, for with religious belief and procedure the modern State has no concern.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIncobotulinumtoxin-A (Xeomin®, Merz Pharmaceuticals, Sydney, New South Wales) is a {{formulation}} of botulinum neurotoxin type A that {{is free of}} complexing proteins. ObjectiveTo assess the cost-effectiveness of incobotulinumtoxin-A administered with flexible treatment intervals compared to onabotulinumtoxin-A (Botox®, Sydney, New South Wales) in blepharospasm and cervical dystonia {{from the perspective of}} Australian health care providers. MethodsA Markov state transition model was developed to perform a cost-utility analysis to compare the cost and health benefits of incobotulinumtoxin-A to that of onabotulinumtoxin-A. The cost-utility analysis compared incobotulinumtoxin-A treatment, given at <b>minimum</b> <b>intervals</b> of 6 weeks and maximum intervals of 20 weeks, with onabotulinumtoxin-A treatment, given at <b>minimum</b> <b>intervals</b> of 12 weeks and maximum intervals of 20 weeks. The Markov model consisted of three health states and followed patients in weekly cycles for 5 years. Only direct health care costs associated with the acquisition and administration of type A botulinum neurotoxins were included. Utility values were derived from a prospective, open-labeled cohort study. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. ResultsIncobotulinumtoxin-A was cost-effective compared to onabotulinumtoxin-A in both blepharospasm and cervical dystonia, with an incremental cost/quality-adjusted life-year gained of A$ 25, 588 and A$ 23, 794, respectively. ConclusionsIncobotulinumtoxin-A administered at flexible treatment intervals determined by the needs of the patient was found to be a cost-effective treatment option when compared to the administration of onabotulinumtoxin-A in the Australian health care system. The option to administer incobotulinumtoxin-A according {{to the needs of the}} patient resulted in patients experiencing symptoms for a fewer number of weeks compared to onabotulinumtoxin-A given at <b>minimum</b> 12 -week <b>intervals...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{utility of}} spectral analysis of {{heart rate variability}} is currently under research. We studied the correlation between heart rate variability measures derived from frequency domain and maximum-minimum method during one minute deep breathing at 6 respiratory cycles per minute. Ten healthy volunteers aged between 20 - 22 years of either sex {{took part in the}} study. Heart rate response to deep breathing was recorded with the subject in supine position connected to the limb lead II. Simultaneously the ECG signals were picked up by the digital data acquisition system and fed in to a computer. Heart rate variability measures from maximum-minimum and frequency domain method were estimated by computer assisted method. The heart rate variability measures calculated for evaluation from frequency domain method was high and low frequency absolute power spectra. The values derived from maximum-minimum method were maximum R-R <b>interval,</b> <b>minimum</b> R-R <b>interval</b> and its ratio during deep berating.
