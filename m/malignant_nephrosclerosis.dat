40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{identify}} the association between pathological types of kidney and clinical manifestations in patients with hypertensive nephropathy. The blood pressure, fundus, urinalysis test results and renal func-tion changes were analysed in patients who were treated for hypertensive nephropathy. Downward kidney puncture biopsy was performed using a 16 G ejection needle with the aid of B ultrasound in 47 cases. The specimens were observed using light microscopy and immunofluorescence. The pathological changes observed in the patients exhibiting symptoms of hypertensive nephropathy varied. The majority of clinical manifestations were benign arteriolar nephrosclerosis, hyaline degeneration of the renal artery and the appearance of a thickened wall of a thickened renal artery wall. Severe cases showed <b>malignant</b> arteriolar <b>nephrosclerosis</b> characterised by fibrinoid necrosis of renal arterioles and intimal hyperplasia. In addition, in the severe cases, fibrinoid necrosis of the afferent arteriole and arcuate artery wall was observed, with severe interlobular artery and arcuate artery myointimal thickening. Renal biopsy in patients with hypertensive nephropathy is safe and feasible. The prognosis and treatment of pathological and clinical disease related to renal pathology is necessary...|$|R

40|$|Background: Stroke-prone spontaneously {{hypertensive}} rats (SHRSP) on 1 % NaCl drinking {{solution and}} Stroke-Prone Rodent Diet develop severe hypertension and glomerular and vascular lesions characteristic of thrombotic microangiopathy seen in <b>malignant</b> <b>nephrosclerosis.</b> We recently reported that spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, markedly reduced proteinuria and malignant nephrosclerotic lesions in these animals. This observation, together with our previous findings that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent {{the development of}} vascular damage, suggests that mineralocorticoids, {{as part of the}} renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), play a pathophysiologic role in this model. In the present study, we examined whether chronic (2 -week) infusion of aldosterone can reverse the renal vascular protective effects of captopril in SHRSP. Methods: SHRSP received vehicle (n= 8); captopril alone (50 mg • kg- 1 • d- 1, orally) (n= 10); aldosterone infusion alone (40 µg • kg- 1 • d- 1, SC) (n= 7); or captopril and aldosterone at 20 µg • kg- 1 • d- 1 (n= 6) or 40 µg • kg- 1 • d- 1 (n= 7). Results: Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was markedly elevated in all groups. Vehicle-and-aldosterone-infused SHRSP developed severe proteinuria and comparable degrees of renal injury (21 ± 3 % and 29 ± 3 %, respectively), manifested as thrombotic and proliferative lesions in the arterioles and glomeruli. Captopril treatment reduced plasma aldosterone levels concomitant with marked reductions in proteinuria and the absence of histologic lesions of <b>malignant</b> <b>nephrosclerosis.</b> Aldosterone substitution at 20 µg • kg- 1 • d- 1 or 40 µg • kg- 1 • d- 1 in captopril-treated SHRSP resulted in the development of severe renal lesions (16 ± 3 % and 21 ± 2 %, respectively) and proteinuria comparable to that observed in SHRSP given either aldosterone or vehicle alone. Conclusion: These findings support a major role for aldosterone in the development of <b>malignant</b> <b>nephrosclerosis</b> in saline-drinking SHRSP, independent of the effects of blood pressure (BP) ...|$|E

Plasma renin activity (PRA) had also been determined in individual FH rats. FH rats aged 4. 5 weeks had no renal morphological abnormalities. The severity of the glomerulosclerosis increased with age and showed a positive relationship with blood pressure. The scores of the proteinaceous tubular casts also increased with age and they, too, showed a positive correlation with blood pressure. The severity of glomerulosclerosis and proteinaceous casts at 40 weeks of age was related positively to the course of blood pressure throughout life.

40|$|Background. - Elastosis of the {{prostate}} may be seen on needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens, but its significance is unknown.

Objective. - To observe the frequent occurrence of elastosis of {{the prostate}} stroma in areas of postatrophic hyperplasia. Design. - A step-section method was used to cut the posterior lobe (or peripheral zone) in coronal planes at intervals of 0. 3 to 0. 5 cm in 100 consecutive autopsy specimens of men older than 40 years. Elastosis was detected because of a basophilic tinge of the stroma on hematoxylin-eosin stain and confirmed using elastic fiber stains. Presence of elastosis correlated with the following variables: age, prostatic atrophy (simple, hyperplastic, or sclerotic), local arteriosclerosis, histologic carcinoma, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, benign or <b>malignant</b> <b>nephrosclerosis,</b> generalized atherosclerosis, nodular prostatic hyperplasia, and acute inflammation. For statistics, a stepwise linear regression method adjusted for age was used. Results and Conclusions. - Elastosis was found in 65 {{of the prostate}}s examined and was significantly more frequent with increasing age (P <. 001), prostatic atrophy (P <. 001), and local arteriosclerosis (P <. 02). There was no significant relation to histologic carcinoma, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, benign or <b>malignant</b> <b>nephrosclerosis,</b> generalized atherosclerosis, nodular prostatic hyperplasia, and acute inflammation. The correlation with local arteriosclerosis favors a possible role of ischemia to its etiopathogenesis.

40|$|THE {{correlation}} of the functional {{behavior and the}} structural char-acteristics of the blood vessels with the physiological units of the kid-ney {{is one of the}} most significant advances in the knowledge of kidney diseases during the past two decades. Evidence is accumulating that in the majority of instances of bilateral kid-ney disease of adult life the failure of the kidney function depends on a pri-mary disease of the renal blood vessels. These cases are now variously classi-fied as hypertensive renal disease, be-nign or <b>malignant</b> <b>nephrosclerosis,</b> and arteriosclerotic kidney disease. Con-trariwise, in acute and chronic glomer-ulonephritis an "infectious process" is believed to involve primarily the glomeruli and tubules. The patholog-ical state of the blood vessels in these latter cases, particularly in chronic glomerulonephritis, also plays a signifi-cant role in the mechanism of disturbed kidney function. In this rather simple but somewhat arbitrary grouping of bilateral kidney diseases, the classification of <b>malignant</b> <b>nephrosclerosis</b> is particularly difficult. Volhard and Fahr, 1 and Lohlein 2 sep-arated this condition from the larger group of glomerulonephritis on the basis of the age of the patients, the rapidly fatal course, certain laboratory findings, and the "acute " histological changes in the glomeruli. The infec-tious character of the glomerular le-sions was emphasized by Volhard and Fahr without sufficient consideration of the vascular lesions. Recently, through the efforts of Fahr, 3 the sig-nificance of the necrotizing arteriolitis, productive endarteritis and periarteritis of the kidneys and other organs has been receiving a new interpretation. He believes that the glomerular changes, which often predominate in the histo-logic picture, represent secondary ef-fects of prolonged ischemia produced by vascular damage.

40|$|Kidney {{damage is}} {{markedly}} accelerated by high-salt (HS) intake in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are epoxygenase products of arachidonic acid which possess vasodepressor, natriuretic and anti-inflammatory activities. We examined whether up-regulation (clofibrate) or inhibition (MS-PPOH) of epoxygenase would alter {{systolic blood pressure}} (SBP) and/or renal pathology in SHRSP on HS intake (1 % NaCl drinking solution). Three weeks of treatment with clofibrate induced renal cortical protein expression of CYP 2 C 23 and increased urinary excretion of EETs compared with vehicle-treated SHRSP. SBP and urinary protein excretion (UPE) were significantly lowered with clofibrate treatment. Kidneys from vehicle-treated SHRSP, which were on HS intake for 3 weeks, demonstrated focal lesions of vascular fibrinoid degeneration, which were markedly attenuated with clofibrate treatment. In contrast, 2 weeks of treatment with the selective epoxygenase inhibitor, MS-PPOH, increased UPE without significantly altering neither urinary EET levels nor SBP. Kidneys from vehicle-treated SHRSP, which were on HS intake for 11 days, demonstrated occasional mild damage whereas kidneys from MS-PPOH-treated rats exhibited widespread <b>malignant</b> <b>nephrosclerosis.</b> These results suggest that pharmacological manipulation of epoxygenase results in divergent effects on renal damage and that interventions to increase EET levels may provide therapeutic strategies for treating salt-sensitive hypertension and renal damage...|$|E
40|$|These {{experiments}} indicate that, in dogs at least, ischemia localized to {{the kidneys}} is a sufficient {{condition for the}} production of persistently elevated systolic blood pressure. When the constriction of both main renal arteries is made only moderately severe in the beginning, the elevation of systolic blood pressure is unaccompanied by signs of materially decreased renal function. In this respect the hypertension in these animals resembles the hypertension which is associated with so called benign nephrosclerosis in man. Subsequent increase of the constriction of the main renal arteries does not materially damage renal function, probably because of adequate development of accessory circulation. More delicate methods for detecting a change may yet prove that some damage does occur. Almost complete constriction of both main renal arteries, from the beginning, results in great elevation of systolic blood pressure which is accompanied by severe disturbance of renal function and uremia. This resembles the type of hypertension which is associated with so called <b>malignant</b> <b>nephrosclerosis,</b> in the sense of Fahr (17). In several of the animals with persistent elevation of systolic blood pressure, anatomical changes were observed in the glomeruli, vessels and parenchyma of the kidneys which are most probably directly referable to the ischemia.

40|$|Background. Ren- 2 {{transgenic}} hypertensive rats develop malignant hypertensive nephrosclerosis despite low {{to normal}} plasma angiotensin II and suppressed renal renin. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} local angiotensin II formation occurs at sites of renal vascular and interstitial injury in this model. Methods. Heterozygous Ren- 2 transgenic rats were compared with normotensive Sprague–Dawley– Hannover control rats and Ren- 2 transgenic rats treated with a very low dose of an angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1) receptor antagonist, 1 mg/kg/day losartan, for 4 weeks. Blood pressure measurements, quantifications of urinary albumin, plasma and tissue angiotensin II as well as immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Results. Systolic blood pressure was not affected by losartan during the study but intra-arterial recordings revealed a decrease of blood pressure. Losartan reduced albumin excretion, cell proliferation, macro-phage influx, collagen I and collagen IV deposition. Plasma angiotensin II was decreased, while kidney tissue angiotensin II content was increased in Ren- 2 transgenic rats compared with control rats. In Ren- 2 transgenic rats, juxtaglomerular renin and angiotensin II staining were reduced, {{but there was a}} marked angiotensin II staining at foci of tubulo-interstitial fibrosis and at proliferative malignant vascular lesions. Conclusion. We conclude that local angiotensin II formation is increased in proliferative or fibrotic kidney lesions in the Ren- 2 transgenic rat. Local angiotensin II formation may help to explain why the AT 1 receptor antagonist prevents or ameliorates this transgenic model of <b>malignant</b> <b>nephrosclerosis</b> despite low to normal plasma angiotensin II and suppressed renal renin...|$|E
40|$|Background—Angiotensin II is {{elevated}} in malignant hypertension. We {{tested the}} hypothesis that angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade can prevent the development of malignant hypertension {{even in the absence}} of a blood pressure–lowering effect. Methods and Results—Two-kidney, 1 -clip rats were followed up for 28 days; blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography and intra-arterially. After a 2 -week run-in phase, rats received valsartan at a dose of 0. 3 (n 514) or 3 (n 512) mg · kg 21 · d 21 or solvent (n 527). Only the higher dose of valsartan, but not the lower dose, decreased blood pressure. Both doses of valsartan prevented the development of lethal malignant hypertension. Twenty of 27 solvent-treated renovascular hypertensive rats died, but only 3 of 14 rats treated with the low dose and 1 of 12 rats treated with the high dose of valsartan died. Histological signs of <b>malignant</b> <b>nephrosclerosis</b> were found in all rats examined that had died throughout the study and in 6 of 7 surviving solvent-treated renovascular hypertensive animals. Increased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 and prominent interstitial influx of macrophages occurred in the nonclipped kidneys exposed to high pressure in solvent-treated rats. These alterations were prevented by valsartan at both doses, irrespective of blood pressure effects. Conclusions—Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade by valsartan prevents lethal malignant hypertension independently of blood pressure.

All HIV-infected individuals with a biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis at our hospital were reviewed. Information about clinical characteristics, histopathologic data and outcome was collected. The incidence of MHT among HIV and non-HIV patients with glomerulonephritis was studied. Results. Thirty HIV patients with glomerulonephritis were identified.

As the result the author arrived at the following conclusions: 1. When the cell functions (wandering velocity and carbon-particle phagocytosis) are low during the tissue culture, vital staining by neutral red takes place fast and highly but the stained color fades quickly. 2. Also when the vital staining is done after fixed intervals of culture, the longer the time of culture is, namely, at the time when the cell functions are further diminished, the more prompt and the higher is the staining and also the fading takes place more quickly. 3.

Evolution of hypertension and vascular disease was studied in groups of MHY and BHY animals killed at 12, 21 and 30 days after ligation. At 12 days MHY and BHY animals showed equally elevated mean arterial pressure (MHY: 184 ± 6; BHY: 189 ± 2 mmHg). MHY animals, however, were characterized by markedly increased plasma renin activity (PRA:MHY: 565 ± 129; BHY: 85 ± 13; sham-operated (SHAM-OP) : 15 ± 2 ng angiotensin I (AI) /ml/h) and widespread necrotizing arteritis with massive fibrinoid deposition. At 21 days fibrinoid deposits had extended to the non-ischaemic kidney, where the initiation of intimal proliferation in interlobular arteries was also present. Elevated PRA in 30 -day MHY animals (MHY: 152 ± 20; BHY: 25 ± 2; SHAM-OP: 19 ± 2 ng/AI/ml/h) was accompanied by generalized necrotizing arteritis, <b>malignant</b> <b>nephrosclerosis</b> and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN:MHY: 50 ± 7 mg/dl; BHY: 29 ± 1 mg/dl; P< 0. 025). In benign hypertensives, despite similarly elevated blood pressure necrotizing lesions were not observed. Although no MHY survived beyond 41 days of hypertension, 108 BHY were alive 60 days after aortic ligation. BHY animals studied at this time were characterized by increased blood pressure (BHY: 177 ± 6; SHAMOP: 112 ± 2 mmHg), normal body wt (BHY: 344 ± 5; SHAM-OP: 353 ± 8 g), normal PRA (BHY: 8 ± 1; SHAM-OP: 9 ± 1 ng AI/ml/h), normal levels of BUN (BHY: 18 ± 2; SHAM-OP: 20 ± 2 mg/dl) {{and the absence of}} necrotizing vascular disease in the kidney or other organs.

40|$|Introduction: Although the {{association}} between thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)  and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a known fact, its prevalence, pathogenesis and progression are not clear yet. Methods: A descriptive, retrospective study involving 12 patients with IgAN and TMA (IgAN-TMA) was carried out; patients were diagnosed by a renal biopsy performed in our hospital {{in order to}} analyze clinicopathologic features. All the biopsy samples were processed for light microscopy and immunofluorescence. Results: The prevalence of patients with IgAN-TMA was 4. 4 % (12 / 274). The mean age was 33 and 58. 3 % of the subjects were men, showing, during diagnosis, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values of 171. 3 ± 53 mmHg and 97. 5 ± 19. 8 mmHg, respectively. The average amount of protein in urine was 5. 3 ± 3. 7 g/ 24 h and 8 patients had nephrotic- range proteinuria. Impairment of renal function was found in 11 patients, with a mean serum creatinine level of 7. 2 ± 4. 7 mg/dL. No clinical or laboratory findings suggested thrombotic microangiopathy {{in any of the}} patients. The renal biopsy showed acute TMA with arteriolar fibrin thrombi in 75 % of the subjects and ‘onion-skin-like’ chronic lesions with concentric intimal hyperplasia in 83. 3 % of them, which were associated with a high percentage of global glomerulosclerosis (72 %), moderate tubular atrophy (38. 6 %) and/or interstitial fibrosis (31. 3 %). In 91. 7 % of the cases, TMA was related to histological grade 5. Conclusions: The prevalence and significance of the relationship between IgAN and TMA pose the question of whether TMA is the cause or consequence of advanced stage IgAN. Several clinicopathologic studies have proved that TMA {{plays a major role in}} IgAN progression. The connection of TMA with creatinine serum and proteinuria levels seems to support this conclusion. While systemic TMA usually affects multiple organs, in these cases, the kidney was the only one compromised. Endothelial injury and the subsequent microvascular thrombosis lead to ischaemia and kidney failure. The TMA-IgAN finding in patients with normal blood pressure at the time of the biopsy suggests that neither hypertension nor advanced parenchymal lesions are a prerequisite for the development of TMA. The physiopathological mechanisms leading to endothelial injury are still unknown, but appear to be different from those of <b>malignant</b> <b>nephrosclerosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{pathologic}} {{features and}} dysfunction of glomerular epithelial cells (GECs) in the pathogenesis of glomerular scarring was studied in the remnant kidney model (RK) (1 and 5 / 6 nephrectomy) in rats. Three weeks after surgery serum creatinine was greater in the RK than either sham-operation controls (SHAM) or spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Blood pressure was higher in the RK (181 +/- 26 mm Hg) than in SHAM (129 +/- 17, P less than 0. 05) but not SHR (195 +/- 15, P less than 0. 05). GEC endocytosis, assessed by protamine heparin aggregate (PHA) disappearance (10), was not different from that in SHAM. Glomerular damage was greater in RK (glomerular damage index, 30 +/- 18) than in SHAM animals (4 +/- 3, P less than 0. 05) and SHR (0, P less than 0. 05), and 2 of 11 RK animals had fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis of arterioles and glomeruli. Segmental sclerosis occurred in only 1 RK animal (0. 6 % of glomeruli). Six weeks after surgery serum creatinine and urinary protein excretion remained higher in the RK than in the SHAM animals. Blood pressure was higher in RK (158 +/- 34 mm Hg) than in SHAM animals (144 +/- 24), but {{the difference was not}} significant. PHA disappeared from the glomerulus at a slower rate in RK than in SHAM animals (outside the 95 % confidence limits of SHAM). Glomerular pathology was more widespread in RK than in SHAM animals (glomerular damage index, 73 +/- 62 versus 3 +/- 8, P less than 0. 05), and 4 of 11 animals had acute hypertensive injury in arterioles and glomeruli. Segmental glomerular sclerosis was only seen in the animals with necrotic glomeruli. GEC dysfunction is not demonstrable until long after proteinuria and hypertension are established, and it only occurs in the context of severe, acute glomerular injury when the epithelial cells separate from the capillary wall and undergo severe degenerative changes and necrosis. The acute glomerular and vascular lesions in the RK model are morphologically similar to <b>malignant</b> <b>nephrosclerosis</b> in humans. Segmental glomerular sclerosis occurs only after proteinuria is well established in the context of severe glomerular injury, and it appears to represent, at least partially, progression of more proximate glomerular capillary injury...|$|E
