5|$|As chief {{engineer}} at Altec, Hilliard joined the Hollywood {{section of the}} Sapphire Group, a regular social gathering of sound recordists and a precursor to the Audio Engineering Society. In 1948, Hilliard was elected to chair the Sapphire Group Recording Standards Committee. He <b>made</b> <b>certain,</b> along with the Motion Picture Research Council, that proposed industry standards were forwarded to members of National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE), Acoustical Society of America (ASA) and Royal Musical Association (RMA). Hilliard helped form the Los Angeles section of the Audio Engineering Society (AES) in 1951. At the beginning of 1963, IRE merged with the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)—Hilliard retained his Fellowship.|$|E
5|$|Controlled {{experiments}} with colonies of Cerapachys biroi suggest {{that an individual}} may choose nest roles based on her previous experience. An entire generation of identical workers was {{divided into two groups}} whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was <b>made</b> <b>certain</b> that the other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to a showcase for visual improvements, Lost Coast acted as a testbed for Valve's commentary system. When the feature is enabled, additional items appear in the game that can be interacted with to play an audio commentary. Each audio piece ranges from ten seconds to a minute of commentary. Players hear the developers {{talk about what the}} player is seeing, what is happening, why they <b>made</b> <b>certain</b> decisions, and what kinds of challenges they faced. Commentary tracks are represented by floating speech bubbles called commentary nodes. Valve intended for players to first play the level with commentary disabled, and after completing the level, play it again with commentary enabled, learning about each new stage as they progress. The company has since made the commentary system standard in all of its later video games.|$|E

5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} event {{of his tenure}} in Salisbury occurred very late in his life when Major Robert Pike, a layman and very prominent member of his church, collided with him {{during the winter of}} 1675 to 1676. There may have been multiple reasons for the severe friction between the men, one of them being that Wheelwright was against the Quaker insurgence into New England, whereas Pike was much more tolerant of their evangelism. Another reason may have been that during the election of 1637, Pike traveled all the way from Newbury to Newtown to vote Governor Vane out of office. A more recent and local cause of dissension was likely over the division of Salisbury when the town of Amesbury was created from it several years earlier. Pike had <b>made</b> <b>certain</b> claims of Wheelwright, to which Wheelwright wrote a petition to the court, and on 10 March 1676 the court sided with Wheelwright. Not easily rebuked, Pike enlisted support from other members of the church and town, following which Wheelwright called for intervention by civil authorities.|$|E

25|$|Tooth decay {{has been}} present {{throughout}} human history, from early hominids {{millions of years}} ago, to modern humans. The prevalence of caries increased dramatically in the 19th century, as the Industrial Revolution <b>made</b> <b>certain</b> items, such as refined sugar and flour, readily available. The diet of the “newly industrialized English working class” then became centered on bread, jam, and sweetened tea, greatly increasing both sugar consumption and caries.|$|E

25|$|In January 1519, at Altenburg in Saxony, {{the papal}} nuncio Karl von Miltitz adopted a more conciliatory approach. Luther <b>made</b> <b>certain</b> {{concessions}} to the Saxon, who was a relative of the Elector, and promised to remain silent if his opponents did. The theologian Johann Eck, however, was determined to expose Luther's doctrine in a public forum. In June and July 1519, he staged a disputation with Luther's colleague Andreas Karlstadt at Leipzig and invited Luther to speak.|$|E
25|$|Dilley's Test {{career was}} {{beginning}} to wind down by this time, and his final match was at Edgbaston in the 1989 Ashes series.

Dilley appeared in three of Worcestershire's matches in April 1992, but despite a couple of appearances in the Second XI, he announced his retirement at the end of that season because of recurring injury problems.|$|E

Bidermann was especially bitter that while Schörner's men were marched off to die in Soviet POW camps at the cessation of hostilities, Schörner <b>made</b> <b>certain</b> that he personally avoided their fate. When captured by the Americans in their sector, Schörner {{is said to have}} been dressed as a Bavarian non-combatant, behavior for which he had only recently had his own soldiers executed.|$|E
25|$|The {{black church}} in the United States {{developed}} out of the creolization of African spirituality and European-American Christianity; early members of the churches <b>made</b> <b>certain</b> stories their own. During the antebellum years, the idea of deliverance out of slavery, as {{in the story of}} Exodus, was especially important. After Reconstruction and the restoration of white supremacy, their hope was based on deliverance from segregation and other abuses. They found much to respond to in the idea of a personal relationship with Jesus, and shaped their churches by the growth of music and worship styles that related to African as well as European-American traditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Lord Richard {{was one of}} a number of events during 1978 that brought UDI to an abrupt end. The loss of one man did not amount to much in the whole scheme of things, but it was the {{identity}} of that man and the nature of his loss that had an impact. One factor that had sustained UDI since 1965 was tacit support from some elements in the British establishment who were variously influenced by anti-communism, appreciation of the colonial era's achievements and a wish to safeguard investments. Lord Richard was the embodiment of that support. His death brought the UDI project into question and <b>made</b> <b>certain</b> people think very hard about the wisdom of it.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{sending the}} full works team down under for the 1967 Tasman Series season, BRM chose to lend their {{support to the}} private Reg Parnell Racing team. The Parnell team {{prepared}} two P261s, for works driver Stewart and previous year's race winner Richard Attwood. With the 2.1-litre V8 engine fitted, Stewart again <b>made</b> <b>certain</b> of a BRM victory in the season opening New Zealand GP. Despite scoring four straight podium finishes, Attwood was replaced by Piers Courage and Chris Irwin for the Australian rounds. Although Courage failed to make a mark, Irwin finished the season by taking third place in Longford. Stewart finished equal second in the series standings, but with fewer than half the points of Championship-winner Jim Clark.|$|E
25|$|Manning {{was sent}} to the Privileges Committee {{following}} statements he made in Parliament on 19 November 2010, during a debate on the Interception of Communications Bill. Manning had <b>made</b> <b>certain</b> allegations about the private residence of Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar on the San Fernando/Siparia/Erin Road. On 24 November 2010, Speaker of the House Wade Mark ruled that a prima facie case of contempt or breach of privilege had been made out against Manning and referred the matter to the Committee for consideration. Manning was accordingly suspended from the service of the House of Representatives with immediate effect on 16 May 2011, as declared by House Speaker Wade Mark. During this period, Manning wouldn't be able to represent his San Fernando East constituency in Parliament. Manning is the second Prime Minister to be suspended from the House of Representatives in Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
25|$|The stadium's {{original}} capacity was 72,000, but Fielding Yost <b>made</b> <b>certain</b> {{to install}} footings that could allow for expansion up to 200,000 seats. Initially, all seating consisted of wooden bleachers. These were replaced with permanent metal seating in 1949 by Fritz Crisler, {{athletic director at}} the time. From 1927 to 1968, the stadium's field was covered in natural grass. This was replaced with TartanTurf in 1969 to give players better traction. However, this surface {{was thought to be}} unforgiving on players' joints, and the stadium returned to natural turf in 1991. This too became problematic, as the field's below-surface location near the water table made it difficult for grass to permanently take root. The field was converted to FieldTurf, an artificial surface designed to give grass-like playing characteristics, in 2003. In 2010, it was upgraded with a brighter and higher quality version of field turf called Duraspine.|$|E
