50|$|Ivan Dulin (Иван Дулин) is {{the first}} {{homosexual}} <b>milling-machine</b> operator in Russia. He works at the Chelyabinsk steel factory number 69 (the show's creators originally wanted to depict factory number 68, which actually exists, but the factory's manager refused to have it on the show; {{he said that there}} are no gays at his factory). Ivan Dulin is in love with his boss Mikhalych (Михалыч is a patronymic, his first and last names vary from season to season), who is heterosexual and refuses to sleep with Dulin. The gay miller constantly comes up with clever plots to seduce Mikhalych, but fails. At the end of most sketches, some factory workers walk in on Dulin and Mikhalych's quarrels and assume they are having sexual intercourse.|$|E

Modification accomplished by removal of original milling head from machine and by mounting vertical slide in its place. Vertical slide driven {{up and down}} by connecting rod bolted off-center to drive pulley. Pulley driven by belt from variable-speed electric motor. <b>Milling-machine</b> head then attached to vertical slide. Mechanism allowed independent control of reciprocating surface speed through variation of speed of electric motor...|$|E
50|$|CNC {{machines}} {{can exist}} in virtually {{any of the}} forms of manual machinery, like horizontal mills. The most advanced CNC <b>milling-machines,</b> the multiaxis machine, add two more axes {{in addition to the}} three normal axes (XYZ). Horizontal milling machines also have a C or Q axis, allowing the horizontally mounted workpiece to be rotated, essentially allowing asymmetric and eccentric turning. The fifth axis (B axis) controls the tilt of the tool itself. When all of these axes are used in conjunction with each other, extremely complicated geometries, even organic geometries such as a human head can be made with relative ease with these machines. But the skill to program such geometries is beyond that of most operators. Therefore, 5-axis milling machines are practically always programmed with CAM.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{researches}} {{a bilateral}} relations between computer techniques {{and methods of}} architectural design. It represents a holistic attitude because of a multithread analysis {{in the field of}} the theory of design, a new hard- and software used by architects,  and a design practice.   Thesis: Contemporary computer science development {{at the end of the}} twentieth century pushed  architects to use hard- and software as tools, which became an active support  (more than just CAAD).   It enabled to widen the scope of a form-properties research and a generation of solutions impossible to achieve before, by using traditional methods and tools. This situation leads to new, unpredictable possibilities of architectural research and design.   Objectives: 1. Definition of the latest trends in computer technologies applied in architectural offices. 2. Presentation of some practical consequencies of application of those technologies in design and construction. 3. Separation of new design methods caused by use of digital tools. 4. A simplified taxonomy of the methods above, with characteristic features. 5. A research in practical application of digital tools in Polish and foreign offices,  as well as at the WUT Faculty of Architecture.  The subject of the work: The thesis constitutes of five chapters. The first chapter is an introduction, where the range of work is presented in the context of place, time and the research made.  The following chapters research three aspects of CAAD: (1) hardware and software,  (2) new definition of architecture, which is a result of application of the digital tools,  (3) practical problems connected with the use of computer techniques.   The second chapter describes the new technologies in use -Virtual Reality (incl. VRD, CAVEis, Data Gloves, motion-capture), Rapid prototyping (incl. holographic printers, 3 D scanners, routers, <b>milling-machines),</b> new types of interfaces (e. g. xWorlds, InfoSpace, Flock of birds), etc. The third chapter is a theoretical one. It presents three types of changes in design methods, which can be classified, judging by results, in architecture of: (a) in-formation (b)   de-formation and (c) cyberspace. All the mentioned applications of a digital technology cause redefinition of the range of the architectsi profession.  The fourth chapter is concentrated on the application and utilization of technology. It is a detailed analysis of chosen buildings (characteristic examples) and design methods used by some avant-garde and well-known practitioners and visioners of architecture (Eisenman, Gehry, Spuybroek, etc.). It also presents statistics, where the influence of digital tools on the way of working (efficiency, productivity, use of tools)   is expressed  numerically.  A synthesis summarizes the relation between architects and the new digital tools in some aspects: hard- and software, social changes, ergonomics, methodics, linguistic/symbolic and architectural. The mentioned ranges of interaction constitute the proof of the thesis. ...|$|R
40|$|A fatigue {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine how}} much electrical-discharge-machine (EDM) processing affected the fatigue life of balance materials: EDM and regular <b>milling-machine</b> (MM) samples were compared. Simulation of a typical balance stress configuration was devised for the fatigue testing in order to obtain results more closely related to balance situations. The fatigue testing of the EDM and MM specimens has indicated that the EDM technique does indeed reduce the fatigue life of 15 - 5 PH steel, the first balance material tested. This conclusion was based on comparisons of the specimen fatigue lives with theoretical and manufacturer's data. Hence the EDM surface effects are detrimental to the fatigue life of this balance material...|$|E
