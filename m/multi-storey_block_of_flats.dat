40|$|Fire {{has always}} been a killer.

The flats {{were built}} in 1966 by George Wimpey Ltd, the {{building}} contained 114 flats and was known by locals, tongue in cheek, as 'The Hilton'. They also tell of a close community within the block. On 28 March 1993, 30 Bogany Terrace {{was reduced to a}} pile of rubble in what was to become the third successfully controlled explosion in Glasgow.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Cardiff Council {{decided to build}} low cost social housing in Llanedeyrn, with an {{estimated}} 3,500 homes to be erected for 12,000 poor people (2,000 homes owned by the city council and 1,500 private homes). The first of the estates in the area was opened in 1968. The council provided prefabricated and terraced houses, and many two-, three- and <b>multi-storey</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> were constructed.|$|R
50|$|More than 20 <b>multi-storey</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> council <b>flats</b> {{were built}} around Ladywood during the 1960s and 1970s; however, {{six of them}} were {{demolished}} in the early 2000s.|$|R
25|$|Council house {{building}} {{in the first decade}} following the end of the Second World War was extensive; with more than 37,000 new homes being completed between then and the end of 1954. These included the first <b>of</b> several hundred <b>multi-storey</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats.</b> Despite this, some 20% of the city's houses were still reported to be unfit for human habitation. As a result, mass council {{house building}} continued for some 20 years afterwards. The existing suburbs continued to expand, while several completely new estates were developed.|$|R
5000|$|Leamore {{is a mix}} {{of private}} and council housing, built since the late 19th century. The most {{significant}} homes in the area are several <b>multi-storey</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> council <b>flats,</b> which were built in the 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|Mining subsidence, {{which has}} taken its toll on many {{buildings}} across central England, has also made its mark in Darlaston. In 1999, a council house on the New Moxley housing estate collapsed down a disused mineshaft while its occupants were on holiday. The adjoining house also had to be knocked down. Since then, the council owned housing stock in Darlaston has broken away from Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council and is now controlled by Darlaston Housing Trust. In 2001, two of the town's four <b>multi-storey</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> were demolished, and the remaining two were demolished in 2004[...]|$|R
50|$|Land was compulsorily {{purchased}} {{and construction of}} the 15,590 dwellings (including 39 <b>multi-storey</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats)</b> was begun in 1966 and completed in 1970. Although the area became part of Solihull in 1974, Birmingham City Council retained control of their houses until they were officially transferred to Solihull MBC on 29 September 1980. Construction started in 1965 and the first rates were levied on houses in Oak Croft on 6 March 1967. Such was {{the scale of the}} operation that a development company was to design finance and build a complete town centre which was officially opened by H.M. The Queen on 7 April 1972.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} as a for-profit joint stock company, {{with the objective of}} building new houses for the working classes [...] "in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on <b>multi-storey</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875.|$|R
50|$|A major housing {{development}} in Northfield was the Egghill Estate {{in the west}} of the district. It was built by the city council during the 1950s and 1960s, with hundreds of properties being built. There were several <b>multi-storey</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> as well as lower <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> and a shopping centre among the concentration of low-rise housing. By the 1980s, however, the estate was plagued by crime and the declining quality of the housing stock. In 2000, the city council decided to demolish the entire estate {{to make way for a}} new {{housing development}}. A decade on, however, the redevelopment is far from complete. Some of the old houses remain, while only a small number of new housing association properties have been built, and the bulk of the estate remains derelict and undeveloped. When the redevelopment is finally completed, it is expected that the new Egghill Estate will include improved shopping and community facilities.|$|R
500|$|The Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company (Artizans Company) was {{established}} in 1867 by William Austin. Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had {{worked his way up}} to become a drainage contractor. The company {{was established}} as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes [...] "in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements".

5000|$|The {{original}} part of Eve Hill, however, {{was still standing}} {{by the start of}} the 1960s, and by this stage most of the houses in the area were in an unfit condition with outdoor toilets, tin baths, and no electricity or running water. Dudley council decided to demolish the bulk of the older houses around Eve Hill in 1962, {{and by the end of}} the decade the landscape had altered drastically. The older houses had been levelled, with many families being rehoused on new council estates like Russells Hall, and the site had been redeveloped with three <b>multi-storey</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> council <b>flats</b> - Millfield Court, Prince of Wales Court, and Butterfield Court - being occupied by 1969. These tower blocks were 19, 19 and 16 storeys high respectively. A shopping parade including a butcher's shop and a Post Office were built in the shadow of Millfield Court.|$|R

50|$|Just over 50% of the {{dwellings}} are standalone {{houses and}} 37% are higher density residential properties, including <b>multi-storey</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> apartments and units. Some houses {{are covered by}} historic preservation laws seeking to preserve the historical character e.g. tin roofing. Contrasting sharply with the historic homes are new buildings of contemporary designs. Prices {{for all types of}} properties have been increasing dramatically in recent decades. According to REIQ, the median unit/town-house price in West End for 2005 is $310,000, and the median house price is $490,500.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s {{with the}} working-class {{population}} expanding, housing estates <b>of</b> high-rise <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> {{were built in}} the centre {{as well as on the}} outskirts of the town. Because of inappropriate infrastructure development, a such <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> exploded in 2007.|$|R
