500|$|Other reviewers {{felt that}} the film's attempt to appeal to an older, more mature {{audience}} was ultimately a bad idea.

Leading up to their wedding day, Big becomes overwhelmed by the media attention and the number of guests, telling Carrie that he would have been happy with eloping to City Hall, that all he wanted was Carrie and that he's embarrassed by the attention because it's his third marriage. On the day of the ceremony, Big has a [...] "freakout" [...] and leaves the wedding venue without even getting out of his limousine. When Carrie calls him and asks where he is, he states [...] "I can't do this" [...] and Carrie leaves devastated. He immediately realizes his mistake and tells the limo driver to turn around but the damage is already done. Carrie, hurt and betrayed, blocks all communication, unknowingly ignoring his love letters and apologetic emails. Over {{the course of the next}} 7 or 8 months, Carrie reflects on what happened and realizes that she is partially to blame for the wedding fiasco, because she let the wedding [...] "get bigger than Big." [...] Finally, Carrie and Big unintentionally meet, come to terms with each other, reaffirm their feelings and love, and privately marry at City Hall - the way Big had originally envisioned - with Carrie wearing the simple [...] "label-less" [...] vintage suit she had initially chosen, along with the blue <b>Manolo</b> <b>Blahniks</b> that had played a big part in the two of them reuniting.|$|R
