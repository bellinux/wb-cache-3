The numerical illustrations of our results reveal that the analytical bounds are very tight.

Following a Risk Management-oriented approach, this paper first aims at singling out all sources of risk affecting Variable Annuities (‘risk identification phase’). Critical aspects arise from the interaction between financial and demographic issues. In particular, the longevity risk may have a dramatic impact on the technical equilibrium of a portfolio. Then, we deal with risk quantification (‘risk assessment phase’), mostly via stochastic simulation of financial and demographic scenarios. Our main contribution is to present an integrated approach to risks in Variable Annuity products, so providing a unifying and innovative point of view...|$|R

50|$|The plan {{provides}} up to {{one year}} of tax-free benefits equal to 55% of the recipient's average gross (pre-tax) income in a recent base period quarter. The <b>minimum</b> <b>benefit</b> is $50 a week and as of January 1, 2017, the upper limit is $1,173 per week. Excluding the current and immediately previous quarter, the base period is the four quarters immediately prior to that. The weekly benefit is 55% of the recipient's average weekly pay during the highest earning quarter in the base period. For example, assuming the recipient's highest quarterly earnings were $3,900 then dividing by 13 weeks, gives an average pay rate of pay of $300 per week. At 55% of this, the benefit amount would be $165 per week (or $330 per two-week benefit payment period).|$|E

40|$|This paper uses a {{large-scale}} overlapping generations model that features intragenerational heterogeneity {{to show that}} privatizing the U. S. Social Security System could be done on a progressive basis. We start with a close replica of the current system; specifically, we include Social Security's progressive linkages between taxes paid and benefits received. The paper compares achieving progressivity as part of privatization reform by a) providing a pay-as-you-go-financed <b>minimum</b> <b>benefit</b> to all agents at retirement independent of their contributions and b) matching contributions to private retirement accounts on a progressive basis. Although a pay-as-you-go-financed <b>minimum</b> <b>benefit</b> can enhance progressivity, it comes {{at the cost of}} substantially smaller long-run macroeconomic and welfare gains. The reasons are two: First, the ongoing unfunded liability to pay for the <b>minimum</b> <b>benefit</b> is roughly half of the unfunded liability of the current Social Security system. Maintaining this liability limits the effect of privatization on saving and capital accumulation. Second, the tax financing the flat <b>minimum</b> <b>benefit</b> is completely distortionary since the benefit one receives is independent of what one contributes. In contrast, matching worker's contributions on a progressive basis can achieve an equally progressive intragenerational distribution of welfare. But it affords much higher long-run levels of capital, labor supply, output and welfare. ...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{working hard}} and {{playing by the rules}} over long periods, many workers end up poor in retirement. We propose a new, {{enhanced}} <b>minimum</b> <b>benefit</b> for Social Security that targets workers with long careers with low lifetime earnings along with a modest credit that compensates workers for up to three years out of the labor market due to caregiving, unemployment, or poor health. Combining these two elements means that the proposal provides work incentives, yet also recognizes the realities facing low-wage workers, many of whom have had intermittent work careers. The generosity of the proposed <b>minimum</b> <b>benefit</b> varies based on the total number of years that an individual has worked in Social Security-covered employment (with a year defined as four quarters of coverage). It starts at 60 percent of the poverty threshold for a worker with twenty years of Social Security-covered earnings, the minimum required work years to receive a boost from the minimum, and increases to a maximum of 110 percent of poverty for those working 40 or more years.

30|$|An {{important}} policy {{choice is}} how to anchor the minimum unemployment benefit. A natural anchor would be the minimum wage. In theory, the <b>minimum</b> <b>benefit</b> {{would need to be}} below the minimum wage so that low skilled workers have stronger incentives to obtain jobs. The problem, in practice, is that the minimum wage is often subject to political discretion and can be set at levels that are ’too high’. (see Del Carpio et al. 2012 for criteria to assess the level of the minimum wage). An alternative is to use economy wide average earnings as a reference and target a <b>minimum</b> <b>benefit</b> that is below 30 percent of this target – also a reference for the level of the minimum wage in the literature.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{submission}} is to set out The Health Insurance Authority’s (“the Authority”) views on issues relating to minimum benefits, including changes to the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Benefit</b> Regulations (S. I. No. 83 of 1996) proposed by the Government in the White Paper on Private Health Insurance, 1999 (the White Paper). The current <b>Minimum</b> <b>Benefit</b> Regulations incorporate detailed prescriptive schedules of treatments and minimum amounts of cover that insurers are required to offer {{for each of these}} treatments. The minimum amounts specified for treatments in the current regulations are in monetary terms. Amounts for hospital accommodation are determined by reference to monetary amounts or proportions of hospital charges. In the White Paper, the Government set out its proposals to revise the minimum benefits system. In particular, proposals were presented to simplify the system from its current structure and also to allow more flexibility to adapt to market developments. In some instances, it was envisaged that the Authority would have a role in determining <b>minimum</b> <b>benefit</b> levels.

40|$|<b>Minimum</b> <b>benefits</b> {{packages}} for employee {{health insurance plans}} usually only include the basic coverage necessary to survive {{in an attempt to}} control costs, similar to the new categorization of essential health benefits (EHBs) outlined in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, in some cases, the advantages that accompany the inclusion of higher-­‐level, more expensive services in a <b>minimum</b> <b>benefits</b> package actually lead to decreased costs over time. Coverage of infertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization, {{is an example of a}} higher-­‐level service that actually leads to lower health care costs in the long run. The decrease in cost through coverage, in turn, leads to healthier outcomes for infants born through these services and their mothers, as well as greater utilization of infertility treatment services. Universal insurance mandates covering in vitro fertilization should be implemented at the state level for <b>minimum</b> <b>benefits</b> packages of employee health insurance, since comprehensive coverage results in lower out-­‐of-­‐pocket costs, which therefore leads to lower rates of multiple births and increased utilization of infertility treatment services. As a recommendation, each state’s legislation should implement insurance mandates, but these mandates should also set limits on the number of cycles of IVF performed, in order to effectively control costs, promote healthier outcomes, and encourage utilization. The paper proceeds as follows. Section I presents the basic facts of infertility. Section II outlines the main issue of infertility treatment and its negative consequences. After describing what has been done so far to solve the problems surrounding infertility treatment in section III, I provide an explanation of the support and backlash that has been expressed regarding these solutions thus far in section IV. Section V details my own proposal for attempting to fix the problems concerning infertility treatment. Finally, Section VI concludes the argument, and presents a potentially threatening hindrance to implementation...|$|R
