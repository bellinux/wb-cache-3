50|$|Because {{they were}} very similar, many parts can be {{exchanged}} between the four cars regardless of brand. For example, the doors from the Fiat Croma fit directly on the 9000. The windshield from the Croma {{can also be used}} on the 9000. Likewise the wing mirrors off both the 9000 and the Thema are almost identical (9000 has a pressed recess on the <b>mirror</b> <b>casing,</b> Thema is without recess) and should fit both cars with the doors being similar. Because its platform was shared closely with three other cars, the Saab 9000's ignition key was situated on the steering column instead of between the front seats. Alfa Romeo differs most from other cars, it has for example an exclusive front suspension and has some chassis modifications. The Saab has a beam axle rear suspension, rather than the independent MacPherson found in all the other models. The front of the Saab is radically different from the Italian siblings due to the much improved crash protection.|$|E

50|$|Starting in 1980, Mercedes {{offered the}} NG trucks {{with a new}} range of engines from 95 kW/130 hp to 276 kW/375 hp. This {{generation}} can be recognized by wind deflectors fitted to the lower front corners of the cabs. In addition, the horizontal chrome bar on the grill was dropped. Model badges and <b>mirror</b> <b>casings</b> were now black. The chassis on semi-trailer tractors was redesigned, lowering it by 120 mm. A fourth cab variant above the L-Fahrerhaus, the GR-Fahrerhaus now was a true long-distance cabin with a raised roof and wardrobe locker. This cab was also wider than the others, noticeable by the flush wheel arches, and {{no longer had a}} rear left side window nor rear windows.|$|R

The cabin is equipped with numerous storage compartments and the luggage compartment is regular in shape, with a capacity of 352 liters, increasing to 1,200 after lowering the rear seat backrest. The load threshold is quite high, hitting the loads of heavy objects. There are laminated side windows and exterior <b>mirrors,</b> with <b>casing</b> specially designed to prevent wind noise and improve comfort inside.|$|R

The center silencer provides reduced backpressure and is constructed from stainless steel. A twin tail pipe system was selected to provide a performance look and sound. The straight exit twin outlets are accented by T-304 stainless steel resonator tips to visually differentiate the Callaway 4.6 HSE from other Range Rovers.

40|$|Bulk {{metallic}} glasses (BMGs), {{a class of}} amorphous metals defined as having a thickness greater than 1 mm, are being broadly investigated by NASA for use in spacecraft hardware. Their unique properties, attained from their non-crystalline structure, motivate several game-changing aerospace applications. BMGs have low melting temperatures {{so they can be}} cheaply and repeatedly cast into complex net shapes, such as <b>mirrors</b> or electronic <b>casings.</b> They are extremely strong and wear-resistant, which motivates their use in gears and bearings. Amorphous metal coatings are hard, corrosion-resistant, and have high reflectivity. BMG composites, reinforced with soft second phases, can be fabricated into energy-absorbing cellular panels for orbital debris shielding. One limitation of BMG materials is their inability to be welded, bonded, brazed, or fastened in a convenient method to form larger structures. Cellular structures (which can be classified as trusses, foams, honeycombs, egg boxes, etc.) are useful for many NASA, commercial, and military aerospace applications, including low-density paneling and shields. Although conventional cellular structures exhibit high specific strength, their porous structures make them challenging to fabricate. In particular, metal cellular structures are extremely difficult to fabricate due to their high processing temperatures. Aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels, for example, are used widely as spacecraft shields due to their low density and ease of fabrication, but suffer from low strength. A desirable metal cellular structure is one with high strength, combined with low density and simple fabrication. The thermoplastic joining process described here allows for the fabrication of monolithic BMG truss-like structures that are 90 % porous and have no heat-affected zone, weld, bond, or braze. This is accomplished by welding the nodes of stacked BMG composite panels using a localized capacitor discharge, forming a single monolithic structure. This removes many complicated and costly fabrication steps. Moreover, the cellular structures detailed in this work are among the highest- strength and most energy-absorbent materials known. This implies that a fabricated structure made from these materials would have unequaled mechanical properties compared to other metal foams or trusses. The process works by taking advantage of the electrical properties of the matrix material in the metal-matrix composite, which in this case is a metallic glass. Due to the random nanoscale arrangement of atoms (without any grain boundaries), the matrix glass exhibits a near-constant electrical resistivity as a function of temperature. By placing the composite panels between two copper electrode plates and discharging a capacitor, the entire matrix of the panel can be heated to approximately 700 C in 10 milliseconds, which is above the alloy s solidus but below the liquidus. By designing the geometry of the panels into the shape of an egg box, the electrical discharge localizes only in the tips of each pyramidal cell. By applying a forging load during discharge, the nodes of the panels can be fused together into a single piece, which then dissipates heat through radiation back into a glassy state. This means that two panels can be metallurgically fused into one panel with no heat-affected zone, creating a seamless connection between panels. During the process, the soft metal particles (dendrites) that are uniformly distributed in the glassy matrix to increase the toughness are completely unaffected by the thermoplastic joining. The novelty is that a truss (or foam-like) structure can be formed with excellent energy- absorbing capabilities without the need for machining. The technique allows for large-scale fabrication of panels, well-suited for spacecraft shields or military vehicle door panels. Crystalline metal cellular structures cannot be fabricated using the thermoplastic joining technique described here. If metal panels were te assembled into a cellular structure, they would either have to be welded, brazed, bonded, or fastened together, creating a weak spot in the structure at each connection. Welded parts require a welding material {{to be added to the}} joint and exhibit a soft and weak heat-affected zone. Brazing and bonding do not form a metallurgical joint and thus exhibit low strengths, especially when the panels are pulled apart and fasteners require high-stress-concentration holes to be drilled. No equivalent rapid heating method exists for assembling metal panels together into cellular structures, and thus, those parts must be foamed, machined, or investment cast if they are to form a monolithic structure. If the crystalline panels were to be joined using capacitive discharge, as with a spot welder, their bond would be very weak, and the panels would have to be extremely thin. In contrast, the strength of joined BMG parts has been demonstrated to have strength comparable to the parent material. This technique opens up the possibility of using large-scale BMG hardware in spacecraft, military, or commercial applications...|$|R
