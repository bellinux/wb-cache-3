25|$|When such a {{complete}} convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, {{or in the}} Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness {{as well as other}} inconveniences of a Change. <b>My</b> <b>poor</b> opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.|$|E
500|$|The three-year-old Lord Denbigh died {{suddenly}} on 19 July 1584 at Wanstead. His death shattered the dynastical hopes of the House of Dudley. Leicester {{stayed away from}} his court duties {{for a few weeks}} [...] "to comfort my sorrowful wife for the loss of my little son, whom God has lately taken from us." [...] He also thanked Lord Burghley for—unsuccessfully—pleading with the Queen [...] "on behalf of <b>my</b> <b>poor</b> wife. For truly my Lord, in all reason she is hardly dealt with." ...|$|E

500|$|During the 1913 Ballets Russes {{season in}} Paris, Monteux {{conducted}} two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it [...] "asinine", while Debussy felt that [...] "Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over <b>my</b> <b>poor</b> rhythms {{like so many}} weeds". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: ...|$|E
500|$|In Poe's distressed state, he made {{reference}} to a wife in Richmond. He may have been delusional, thinking that his wife, Virginia, was still alive, or {{he may have been}} referring to Sarah Elmira Royster, to whom he had recently proposed. He did not know what had happened to his trunk of belongings which, it transpired, had been left behind at the Swan Tavern in Richmond. Moran reported that Poe's final words were [...] "Lord, help <b>my</b> <b>poor</b> soul" [...] before dying on October 7, 1849.|$|E
500|$|Poor Folk {{received}} nationwide critical acclaim. Dostoyevsky {{observed that}} [...] "the whole of Russia {{is talking about}} <b>my</b> <b>Poor</b> Folk". As soon as he read the manuscript for Poor Folk, Belinsky named it Russia's first [...] "social novel". Alexander Herzen praised the book in his essay [...] "About the Progress of Revolutionary Ideas in Russia", noting the book's [...] "socialistic tendencies and animations." [...] The work was classified by critic Pavel Annenkov {{as a work of}} the so-called [...] "natural school". The newspaper The Northern Bee recorded: ...|$|E

'Told myself that you were right for me but felt so lonely in your company' – simple, pure, and devastating. None more than the title line when it speaks of the end of love with prosaic brutality: 'Now you're just somebody that I used to know.' Great video, powerful lyrics, and a stunning voice. Oh, and Kimbra... <b>my</b> <b>poor</b> heart..." ...|$|E
500|$|Victoria visited {{mainland}} Europe {{regularly for}} holidays. In 1889, during {{a stay in}} Biarritz, {{she became the first}} reigning monarch from Britain to set foot in Spain when she crossed the border for a brief visit. By April 1900, the Boer War was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable. Instead, the Queen went to Ireland {{for the first time since}} 1861, in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war. In July, her second son Alfred ("Affie") died; [...] "Oh, God! <b>My</b> <b>poor</b> darling Affie gone too", she wrote in her journal. [...] "It is a horrible year, nothing but sadness & horrors of one kind & another." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 3, 1849, Poe {{was found}} delirious {{on the streets}} of Baltimore, [...] "in great distress, and... in need of {{immediate}} assistance", according to Joseph W. Walker who found him. He was taken to the Washington Medical College where he died on Sunday, October 7, 1849 at 5:00 in the morning. Poe was never coherent long enough to explain how he came to be in his dire condition and, oddly, was wearing clothes that were not his own. He is said to have repeatedly called out the name [...] "Reynolds" [...] on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring. Some sources say that Poe's final words were [...] "Lord help <b>my</b> <b>poor</b> soul". All medical records have been lost, including his death certificate.|$|E

500|$|In 1818, Stephen van Rensselaer, Governor of New York, {{obtained}} {{permission for}} Montgomery's {{remains to be}} moved from Quebec to New York. In June 1818, Montgomery's remains set off for New York City. On July 4 they arrived in Albany and took a boat down the Hudson to New York City. Janet stood out on her porch and watched the boat bring Montgomery's remains down the river, fainting at the sight. When his remains arrived in New York City, 5,000 people attended the procession. His remains were interred on July 8, next to his monument at St. Paul's Chapel in Manhattan, which had been completed in 1776. Janet {{was pleased with the}} ceremony and wrote, [...] "What more could I wish than the high honor that has been conferred on the ashes of <b>my</b> <b>poor</b> soldier." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Rowan Kaiser, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club was very positive towards the episode, writing [...] "'I Am God' {{is probably the}} strangest episode since 'Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner', but unlike that one's somewhat random focus, 'I Am God' is intently pointed at one thing: the bus crash." [...] While wishing that it had come earlier in the season, the reviewer wrote that [...] "its intense style and emotional stakes {{put it on the}} shortlist of best Veronica Mars episodes." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com praised the dream sequences for their beauty, but criticized them for their complexity. [...] "Man, I just could not get enough of the dream-flashbacks in which Veronica talked to the dead students. So beautiful and well-done. On the other hand, <b>my</b> <b>poor</b> brain is starting {{to have a hard time}} keeping all the facts straight." ...|$|E
500|$|Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. Less {{than a month}} later, on 20 June 1837, William IV {{died at the age}} of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. In {{her diary}} she wrote, [...] "I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my {{dressing}} gown) and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that <b>my</b> <b>poor</b> Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I am Queen." [...] Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.|$|E

500|$|Breckinridge's men {{initially}} {{broke the}} Union line and forced {{them across the}} river. Artillery {{on the opposite side}} of the river then opened fire on Breckinridge's men, and reinforcements for the fleeing Union troops arrived. In just over an hour, [...] nearly one-third of Breckinridge's troops were killed, wounded, or captured. One anecdote holds that, as he rode among the survivors, he cried out repeatedly, [...] "My poor Orphans! <b>My</b> <b>poor</b> Orphans," [...] bringing recognition to the Orphan Brigade. Bragg's official report criticized the conduct of Breckinridge's division and assigned to Breckinridge most of the blame for the Confederate defeat. Breckinridge asserted to his superiors that Bragg's report [...] "fails... to do justice to the behavior of my Division"; he requested a court of inquiry, but the request was denied. Several Kentuckians under Breckinridge's command, who already blamed Bragg for the failed invasion of their native state, encouraged him to resign his commission and challenge Bragg to a duel.|$|E
500|$|Mary {{was convicted}} on 25 October {{and sentenced to}} death with only one commissioner, Lord Zouche, expressing any form of dissent. Despite this, Elizabeth hesitated to order her execution, {{even in the face of}} {{pressure}} from the English Parliament to carry out the sentence. She was concerned that the killing of a queen set a discreditable precedent, and was fearful of the consequences, especially if, in retaliation, Mary's son James formed an alliance with the Catholic powers and invaded England. Elizabeth asked Paulet, Mary's final custodian, if he would contrive a clandestine way to [...] "shorten the life" [...] of Mary, which he refused to do on the grounds that he would not make [...] "a shipwreck of my conscience, or leave so great a blot on <b>my</b> <b>poor</b> posterity". On 1 February 1587, Elizabeth signed the death warrant, and entrusted it to William Davison, a privy councillor. On the 3rd, ten members of the Privy Council of England, having been summoned by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge, decided to carry out the sentence at once.|$|E
500|$|While dying, Virginia {{asked her}} mother: [...] "Darling... will you console {{and take care}} of <b>my</b> <b>poor</b> Eddyyou will never never leave him?" [...] Her mother stayed with Poe until his own death in 1849. As Virginia was dying, the family {{received}} many visitors, including an old friend named Mary Starr. At one point Virginia put Starr's hand in Poe's and asked her to [...] "be a friend to Eddy, and don't forsake him". Virginia was tended to by 25-year-old Marie Louise Shew. Shew, who served as a nurse, knew medical care from her father and her husband, both doctors. She provided Virginia with a comforter as her only other cover was Poe's old military cloak, as well as bottles of wine, which the invalid drank [...] "smiling, even when difficult to get it down". Virginia also showed Poe a letter from Louisa Patterson, second wife of Poe's foster-father John Allan, which she had kept for years and which suggested that Patterson had purposely caused the break between Allan and Poe.|$|E

500|$|Maria Amélia and her mother, who had {{accompanied}} her, disembarked on 31 August in Funchal, {{the capital of}} Madeira. The entire town greeted her joyfully, and a crowd followed the princess to her new home. She adored the island and told her mother: [...] "If I one day recover my previous robust health, isn't that so mommy, we will stay {{a long time in}} this island. We will make long excursions in the mountains, we will find new paths, just as we did in Stein!" [...] But her health worsened, {{and by the end of}} November, all hope was gone. By the beginning of 1853, the princess was bedridden, and she knew death was approaching: [...] "My strength diminishes from day to day; I can feel it... we are reaching the beginning of the end." [...] A little after midnight in the early hours of 4 February, a priest administered the last rites. Maria Amélia tried to comfort her mother: [...] "Do not cry... let God's will be done; may He come to my aid in my last hour; may He console <b>my</b> <b>poor</b> mother!" [...] She died later that morning at around 04:00.|$|E
500|$|Madness {{frequently}} discovers itself {{merely by}} unnecessary {{deviation from the}} usual mode of the world. <b>My</b> <b>poor</b> friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, {{or in any other}} unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr [...] Burney:– Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was carried back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit [...] Smart as any one else. Another charge was that he did not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.'– Johnson continued. 'Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it.' ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{presentation}} of evidence against her, Mary broke down and pointed accusingly at Walsingham saying, [...] "all {{of this is the}} work of Monsieur de Walsingham for my destruction", to which he replied, [...] "God is my witness that as a private person I have done nothing unworthy of an honest man, and as Secretary of State, nothing unbefitting my duty." [...] Mary was found guilty and the warrant for her execution was drafted, but Elizabeth hesitated to sign it, despite pressure from Walsingham. Walsingham wrote to Paulet urging him to find [...] "some way to shorten the life" [...] of Mary to relieve Elizabeth of the burden, to which Paulet replied indignantly, [...] "God forbid that I should make so foul a shipwreck of my conscience, or leave so great a blot to <b>my</b> <b>poor</b> posterity, to shed blood without law or warrant." [...] Walsingham made arrangements for Mary's execution; Elizabeth signed the warrant on 1 February 1587 and entrusted it to William Davison, who had been appointed as junior Secretary of State in late September 1586. Davison passed the warrant to Cecil and a privy council convened by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge agreed to carry out the sentence as soon as was practical. Within a week, Mary was beheaded. On hearing of the execution, Elizabeth claimed not to have sanctioned the action and that she had not meant Davison to part with the warrant. Davison was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Walsingham's share of Elizabeth's displeasure was small because he was absent from court, at home ill, in the weeks just before and after the execution. Davison was eventually released in October 1588, on the orders of Cecil and Walsingham.|$|E
