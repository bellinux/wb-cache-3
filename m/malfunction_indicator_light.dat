The amount of diagnostic information available via OBD has varied widely since its introduction in the early 1980s versions of on-board vehicle computers.

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which {{mandates}} an increase in renewable fuels for the transport sector, the U.S. Department of Energy began assessments for the feasibility of using intermediate ethanol blends in the existing vehicle fleet as a way to allow higher consumption of ethanol fuel. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted tests to evaluate the potential impacts of intermediate ethanol blends on legacy vehicles and other engines. In a preliminary report released in October 2008, the NREL presented the results of the first evaluations of the effects of E10, E15 and E20 gasoline blends on tailpipe and evaporative emissions, catalyst and engine durability, vehicle driveability, engine operability, and vehicle and engine materials. This preliminary report found none of the vehicles displayed a <b>malfunction</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>light</b> as {{a result of}} the ethanol blend used; no fuel filter plugging symptoms were observed; no cold start problems were observed at [...] and [...] laboratory conditions; and as expected, computer technology available in newer model vehicles adapts to the higher octane causing lower emissions with greater horsepower and in some cases greater fuel economy.|$|E

OBD-II, standardizes {{on the amount}} of memory (Freeze Frame) it uses to store the readings of the vehicle sensor when it logs on emission related Intermittent Trouble code (IT). The intent of OBD-II, systems is to detect most vehicle malfunctions when performance of a power train component or system deteriorates {{to the point that the}} vehicle’s HC emission exceed standard. The vehicle operator is notified at the time when the vehicle begins to marginally exceed emission standards, by illuminating the <b>Malfunctions</b> <b>Indicator</b> <b>Light</b> (MIL).

40|$|DISCUSSION: The {{on-board}} diagnostics II (OBD II) regulation requires all vehicle manufacturers to monitor virtually every emission-control component and {{system that can}} cause increases in emissions. When an emission-related malfunction is detected, the OBD II system alerts the vehicle owner by illuminating the <b>malfunction</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>light</b> (MIL) on the vehicle instrument panel. By alerting the owner of malfunctions as they occur, repairs can be sought promptly, which results in fewer emissions from the vehicle. Manufacturers began phase-in of the OBD II requirements in 1994, with full implementation required on all 1996 and newer model year vehicles. The Air Resources Board (ARB) last adopted modifications to the curren...|$|E
40|$|California is {{considering}} adopting an enhanced Inspection and Maintenance (I&M) program (commonly {{referred to as}} Smog Check II) beginning with the 1996 calendar year. This program will utilize a targeting scheme to identify vehicles likely to be high emitters and send these vehicles to centralized testing facilities. The remaining fleet of vehicles {{will be sent to}} decentralized testing facilities. At these facilities, vehicles will be subjected to steady state loaded mode dynamometer based tests. Simultaneously, all 1996 and later model year passenger cars, light- and medium-duty trucks sold in California will be equipped with an On-Board Diagnostic (OBDII) system. This system is designed to monitor critical emission related components and activate a <b>Malfunction</b> <b>Indicator</b> <b>Light</b> (MIL) when a failure or a drift in calibration is likely to cause emissions to exceed 1. 5 times the vehicle certification standards. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} ascertain what percentage of the emission benefits are attributable to either I&M or OBDII in order to assist regulators in making near term programmatic decisions. This paper also addresses the potential emission benefits of incorporating a radio transponder into the vehicle's OBDII system that is capable of transmitting fault codes when queried, resulting in prompt identification and repair...|$|E
