40|$|In {{this paper}} a robust <b>multifont</b> <b>character</b> <b>recognition</b> system for {{degraded}} documents such as photocopy or fax is described. The system {{is based on}} Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using discrete and hybrid modeling techniques, where the latter makes use of an information theory-based neural network. The presented recognition results refer to the SEDAL-database of English documents using no dictionary. It is also demonstrated that the usage of a language model, that consists of character n-grams yields significantly better recognition results. Our resulting system clearly outperforms commercial systems and leads to further error rate reductions compared to previous results reached on this database. 1. Introduction During the last years, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs, see [7]) have been used not only for speech recognition but also for on- and off-line handwriting recognition (for example [2, 8]).

40|$|Abstract: This paper reports an {{investigation}} of some methods for isolating, or segmenting, characters during the reading of machineprinted text by optical <b>character</b> <b>recognition</b> systems. Two new segmentation algorithms using feature extraction techniques are presented; both are intended {{for use in the}} recognition of machine-printed lines of lo-, 11 - and 12 -pitch serif-type <b>multifont</b> <b>characters.</b> One of the methods, called quasi-topological segmentation, bases the decision to “section ” a character on a combination of featureextraction and character-width measurements. The other method, topological segmentation, involves feature extraction alone. The algorithms have been tested with an evaluation method that is independent of any particular recognition system. Test results are based on application of the algorithm to upper-case alphanumeric characters gathered from print sources that represent the existing world of machine printing.
