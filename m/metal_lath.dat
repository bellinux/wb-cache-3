In some cases, with fireproof ceilings, for instance, the metal lathing are hung up with wire hangers so as to allow a space of several inches between the soffit of the concrete floor and the ceiling. For partitions <b>metal</b> <b>laths</b> are grouted in with semi-fluid plaster. Where very great strength is required, the work may be reinforced by small iron rods through the slabs. This forms a very strong and rigid partition {{which is at the}} same time fire-resisting and of lightweight, and when finished measures only from two to four inches (102 mm) thick. So strong is the result that partitions of this class only two or three inches (76 mm) thick were used for temporary cells for prisoners at Newgate Gaol during the rebuilding of the new sessions house in the Old Bailey in London.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{demonstrate}} that the foam concrete performance can be improved by dispersed reinforcement, including methods that involve basalt fibres. They address {{the results of the}} foam concrete modeling technology and assess the importance of technology-related parameters. Reinforcement efficiency criteria are also provided in the article. Dispersed reinforcement improves the plasticity of the concrete mix and reduces the settlement crack formation rate. Conventional reinforcement that involves <b>metal</b> <b>laths</b> and rods demonstrates its limited application in the production of concrete used for thermal insulation and structural purposes. Dispersed reinforcement is preferable. This technology contemplates the infusion of fibres into porous mixes. Metal, polymeric, basalt and glass fibres are used as reinforcing components. It has been identified that products reinforced by polypropylene fibres demonstrate substantial abradability and deformability rates even under the influence of minor tensile stresses due to the low adhesion strength of polypropylene in the cement matrix. The objective of the research was to develop the type of polypropylene of D 500 grade that would demonstrate the operating properties similar to those of Hebel and Ytong polypropylenes. Dispersed reinforcement was performed by the basalt fibre. This project contemplates an autoclave-free technology to optimize the consumption of electricity. Dispersed reinforcement is aimed at the reduction of the block settlement in the course of hardening at early stages of their operation, the improvement of their strength and other operating properties. Reduction in the humidity rate of the mix is based on the plasticizing properties of fibres, as well as the application of the dry mineralization method. Selection of optimal parameters of the process-related technology was performed with the help of G-BAT- 2011 Software, developed at Moscow State University of Civil Engineering. The authors also provide their overview of intellectual property rights and an economic efficiency assessment.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of three}} types of Cr steel weld metals, containing 5 %, 9 % and 12 % chromium, was studied in different heat treated conditions using optical microscopy, analytical transmission electron microscopy and atom probe field-ion microscopy. The mechanical properties of the weld metals were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy were used {{to carry out the}} fractography investigation of the impacted specimens. In the 5 % Cr steel weld metal, it was found that M 7 C 3 and M 2 C started to precipitate during tempering at 500 °C. M 23 C 6 precipitated out from 600 °C. The composition of the precipitates also changed according to the tempering temperature. The development of microstructure during tempering was discussed. The microstructure of three 9 % Cr steel weld <b>metals</b> consisted of <b>lath</b> martensite, some retained. delta. -ferrite and precipitates. The predominant precipitates were M 23 C 6. In weld metals containing V and Nb, MC and M 2 C were present. The failure mode of the impacted weld metals was quasi-cleavage. Non- metallic inclusions were found to be the nucleation sites for cleavage cracks during impact. The cleavage stress of the weld metals was determined {{by the size of the}} inclusions and the size of martensite packets or recrystallized ferrite grains (in the case that the quantity of recrystallized ferrite was high). The impact toughness of the weld metals depended on the yield stress and fracture stress of the materials. The microstructure of three varieties of 12 % Cr steel weld metals consisted also of martensite, retained. delta. -ferrite and precipitates. The precipitates included M 23 C 6, MX and M 2 X. The morphology, quantity and distribution of the precipitates were determined by composition and heat treatment of the weld metals. The microstructure development in the weld metals in different heat treatment conditions was investigated. The failure mode of impacted specimens was mainly cleavage. Intercooling the weld metals to 125 °C before post-weld heat treatment did not affect the tensile strength of the weld metals very much, but improved their impact toughness dramatically. The mechanism by which the microstructure of the weld metals affects their mechanical properties was discussed...|$|R

50|$|A {{door frame}} {{can be built}} into the can wall, or rather the can wall is built around the frame.

The door frame is fastened to the tin can wall by hammering nails partially {{into the side of the}} frame that will touch the tin can wall and allowing the concrete to harden around the nails. Short strips of <b>metal</b> <b>lath</b> are also attached to the frame and folded out (perpendicular to the frame) and allowed to set in the can/concrete matrix.|$|E
5000|$|Carpenters {{traditionally}} {{worked with}} natural wood {{which has been}} prepared by splitting (riving), hewing, or sawing with a pit saw or sawmill called lumber (American English) or timber (British English).

Once the desired height is reached to install a window frame, the wall is leveled. If any cans stick above the level plane they can be flattened to the desired height.

5000|$|Frank Lloyd Wright was not {{the only}} voice advocating for {{fireproof}} homes in the early twentieth century; from 1902 to 1908, Thomas Edison was also experimenting with designs for mass-produced houses of as part of the Edison Portland Cement Company. The notion of concrete houses was further popularized in several books by the Atlas Portland Cement Company. The appeal of concrete dwellings was not only the resistance to fire, but also to insects, moisture, and the effects of weather. The walls, floors, roof, and chimney of Wright's design were to be constructed of reinforced concrete or as Wright stated: [...] "a masonry monolith...interlaced with steel fibres". Interior partitions were specified as plaster over either <b>metal</b> <b>lath</b> or three-inch clay tile blocks.

50|$|Gypsum board evolved between 1910 and 1930 {{beginning}} with wrapped board edges and {{elimination of the}} two inner layers of felt paper in favor of paper-based facings.

Providing efficiency of installation, it was developed additionally as a measure of fire resistance. Later air entrainment technology made boards lighter and less brittle, then joint treatment materials and systems also evolved. Rock lath (gypsum lath) was an early substrate for plaster. An alternative to traditional wood or <b>metal</b> <b>lath,</b> it was a panel made up of compressed gypsum plaster board that was sometimes grooved or punched with holes to allow wet plaster to key into its surface. As it evolved, it was faced with paper impregnated with gypsum crystals that bonded with the applied facing layer of plaster.|$|E
