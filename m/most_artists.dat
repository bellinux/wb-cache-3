5|$|Like <b>most</b> <b>artists</b> {{of his era}} and genre, Kunichika created many {{series of}} prints, including: Yoshiwara beauties {{compared}} with thirty-six poems; Thirty-two fashionable physiognomies; Sixteen Musashi parodying modern customs; Thirty-six good and evil beauties; Thirty-six modern restaurants; Mirror of the flowering of manners and customs; Fifty-four modern feelings matched with chapters of The Tale of Genji; Scenes of the twenty-four hours parodied; Actors in theatrical hits as great heroes in robber plays; Eight views of bandits parodied.|$|E
5|$|The series {{refers to}} a set of works by Henri Matisse, with this work {{specifically}} referring to L'Atelier Rouge. The work incorporates several other Lichtenstein's works and gets its name from the large portion of Lichtenstein's Look Mickey that is included. Lichtenstein used a much more realistic representation of his own works than is standard for <b>most</b> <b>artists.</b> Elements of the work also refer to works from both Fernand Léger and Matisse.|$|E
5|$|Casting Crowns {{was formed}} in 1999 by Mark Hall (lead vocals), Hector Cervantes (guitar, vocals), Juan DeVevo (guitar, vocals), and Melodee DeVevo (violin, vocals) as a student worship band. The band is {{originally}} from Daytona Beach, Florida but relocated to Eagle's Landing First Baptist Church in McDonough, Georgia in 2001, where they recruited Megan Garrett (piano/vocals), Andy Williams (drums), and Chris Huffman (bass guitar) as members. One of their independent records was discovered by Mark A. Miller, the lead vocalist for country band Sawyer Brown. Although Casting Crowns had not released their independent records with intentions of receiving a record deal, Miller offered the band {{the opportunity to become}} the first artists signed to his record label. The band agreed to join and signed with the as-yet-unnamed record label, an imprint of Provident Label Group, and began work on their debut album. As a group, Casting Crowns was unusual in several ways, such as having seven members, never having toured before, and their producer (Miller) having no history in the Christian music industry. However, Christian singer and songwriter Steven Curtis Chapman was brought in to co-produce the album with Miller, giving the project a greater amount of support in the Christian music industry. Terry Hemmings, Provident Label Group CEO/President and a personal friend of Miller, openly predicted success for Casting Crowns and made them one of his top priorities at the label. While <b>most</b> <b>artists</b> in a similar situation would have received nine months for artist development, Hemmings gave the band four months and sped up the album's release. Casting Crowns was recorded at Glow in the Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee. The album was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} of Mexico's colonial {{artists were}} Spanish-born {{who came to}} Mexico {{in the middle of}} their careers. This included mendicant friars, such as Fray Alonso López de Herrera. Later, <b>most</b> <b>artists</b> were born in Mexico, but trained in European techniques, often from imported engravings. This dependence on imported copies meant that Mexican works preserved styles after they had gone out of fashion in Europe. In the colonial period, artists worked in guilds, not independently. Each guild had its own rules, precepts, and mandates in technique—which did not encourage innovation.|$|E

25|$|Audubon {{set about}} to study American birds, {{determined}} to illustrate his findings {{in a more}} realistic manner than <b>most</b> <b>artists</b> did then. He began conducting the first known bird-banding on the continent: he tied yarn to the legs of eastern phoebes and determined that {{they returned to the}} same nesting spots year after year. He also began drawing and painting birds, and recording their behavior. After an accidental fall into a creek, Audubon contracted a severe fever. He was nursed and recovered at Fatland Ford, with Lucy at his side.|$|E
25|$|Peter Paul Rubens (1577–1640), {{a student}} of both Otto van Veen and Adam van Noort, spent eight years in Italy (1600–1608), during which time he studied {{examples}} of classical antiquity, the Italian Renaissance, and contemporaries Adam Elsheimer and Caravaggio. Following his return to Antwerp he set up an important studio, training students such as Anthony van Dyck, and generally exerting a strong influence on the direction of Flemish art. <b>Most</b> <b>artists</b> active in the city {{during the first half}} of the 17th century were directly influenced by Rubens.|$|E

You know it might be just this one anonymous glory of all things, this rich stone forest, this epic chant, this gaiety, this grand choiring shout of affirmation, which we choose when all our cities are dust, to stand intact, to mark where we have been, to testify to what we had it in us, to accomplish.|$|E

25|$|Gothic art {{was often}} typological in nature, {{reflecting}} {{a belief that}} the events of the Old Testament pre-figured those of the New, and that that was indeed their main significance. Old and New Testament scenes were shown side by side in works like the Speculum Humanae Salvationis, and the decoration of churches. The Gothic period coincided with a great resurgence in Marian devotion, in which the visual arts played a major part. Images of the Virgin Mary developed from the Byzantine hieratic types, through the Coronation of the Virgin, to more human and initimate types, and cycles of the Life of the Virgin were very popular. Artists like Giotto, Fra Angelico and Pietro Lorenzetti in Italy, and Early Netherlandish painting, brought realism and a more natural humanity to art. Western artists, and their patrons, became much more confident in innovative iconography, and much more originality is seen, although copied formulae were still used by <b>most</b> <b>artists.</b> The book of hours was developed, mainly for the lay user able to afford them – the earliest known example seems to have written for an unknown laywoman living in a small village near Oxford in about 1240 – and now royal and aristocratic examples became the type of manuscript most often lavishly decorated. Most religious art, including illuminated manuscripts, was now produced by lay artists, but the commissioning patron often specified in detail what the work was to contain.|$|E
500|$|By the 1940s, <b>most</b> <b>artists</b> {{had given}} up on the genre. [...] The most devoted practitioners, Masereel and Ward, moved on to other work for which they became better known; Masereel's {{obituary}} did not even mention his wordless novels. [...] Many wordless novels remained out of print until the rise of the graphic novel revived interest amongst readers and publishers in the early 21st century.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary {{observers}} noted Kunichika's skillful use {{of color}} in his actor prints, {{but he was also}} criticized for his choices. [...] Unlike <b>most</b> <b>artists</b> of the period, he made use of strong reds and dark purples, often as background colors, rather than the softer colors that had previously been used. These new colors were made of aniline dyes imported in the Meiji period from Germany. (For the Japanese the color red meant progress and enlightenment in the new era of Western-style progress.) ...|$|E

500|$|<b>Most</b> <b>artists</b> {{came to the}} White Mountains in the summer, but {{returned}} to their urban studios, or sometimes to warmer climates like Florida, in the winter. [...] Therefore, paintings of winter scenes are not common. [...] A few artists, like Champney, Edward Hill (18431923), and Edward's brother, Thomas Hill, would sometimes paint these rarer winter scenes. [...] Two examples of winter paintings, both illustrated in this article, are Thomas Hill's Mount Lafayette in Winter and Benjamin Champney's Moat Mountain from North Conway. Frank Henry Shapleigh (18421906) had a home in Jackson and was a prolific painter of New Hampshire scenes, both in summer and winter.|$|E
500|$|In 1863 Kunichika {{was one of}} {{a number}} of artists who contributed {{landscape}} prints to two series of famous Tokaido scenes commissioned to commemorate the journey made by the shogun Iemochi from Edo to Kyoto to pay his respects to the emperor. Otherwise, his landscapes were primarily theater sets, or backgrounds for groups of beauties enjoying the out-of-doors. He recorded some popular myths and tales, but rarely illustrated battles. When portraying people he only occasionally showed figures wearing Western dress, despite its growing popularity in Japan. He is known to have done some shunga (erotic art) prints but attribution can be difficult as, like <b>most</b> <b>artists</b> of the time, he did not always sign them.|$|E
