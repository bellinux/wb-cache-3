5|$|As {{latent heat}} flux {{releases}} {{are important for}} their development and intensification, most warm seclusion events occur over the oceans; they may impact coastal nations with hurricane force winds and torrential rain. Climatologically, the Northern Hemisphere sees warm seclusions during the cold season months, while the Southern Hemisphere <b>may</b> <b>see</b> a strong cyclone event such as this during all times of the year.|$|E
5|$|Eventually Eva falls terminally ill.

5|$|Blind cricket, {{which is}} played {{basically}} the same as conventional cricket but using larger stumps and wickets and a white ball so that players <b>may</b> <b>see</b> it much more easily, is also played at the college, and RNC has its own cricket team, which competes in the British Blind Sport (BBS) National Cricket League. The college also features acoustic shooting, a sport which uses air rifles fitted with photoelectric cells which convert light reflected from targets into sound.|$|E
5|$|Ten of the {{seventeen}} {{species of}} UK bat are {{found on the}} property, eight within {{the structure of the}} house alone. Species found include the rare and threatened lesser horseshoe bat and greater horseshoe bat. Maintenance work is timed to fit in with hibernating and mating schedules, and new roosts are created during any building work. Visitors <b>may</b> <b>see</b> some of the property's bats on a closed-circuit television system.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss {{climate is}} {{generally}} temperate, but can vary greatly between the localities, from glacial {{conditions on the}} mountaintops to the often pleasant near Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. There are some valley areas {{in the southern part}} of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains <b>may</b> <b>see</b> long intervals of stable conditions for weeks, while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion, during these periods, thus seeing no sun for weeks.|$|E

50|$|The crossed square cupola <b>may</b> be <b>seen</b> {{as a part}} of some uniform polyhedra. For example, {{the great}} cubicuboctahedron <b>may</b> be <b>seen</b> as six crossed square cupolae {{connected}} at their triangular faces, while the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron <b>may</b> be <b>seen</b> as a blend of six cupolae. Additionally, the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron <b>may</b> be <b>seen</b> as an octagrammic prism with the octagrams excavated with crossed square cupolae, similarly to how the rhombicuboctahedron <b>may</b> be <b>seen</b> as an octagonal prism with the octagons augmented with square cupolae. Rotating one of the cupolae in this construction results in the pseudo-great rhombicuboctahedron. To this may be added the great rhombihexahedron, as the exclusive or of all three of these octagrammic prisms which may be used to construct the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron.|$|R
5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt {{to see themselves as}} if they are outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole <b>may</b> <b>see</b> as abnormal.|$|E
5|$|Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; {{angelfish}} and zebras are striped. These patterns have {{an evolutionary}} explanation: they have functions which {{increase the chances}} that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is camouflage; for instance, a leopard that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is signalling — for instance, a ladybird {{is less likely to}} be attacked by predatory birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also distastefully bitter or poisonous, or mimics other distasteful insects. A young bird <b>may</b> <b>see</b> a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting genes that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{suspects}} Connors is the Lizard and unsuccessfully {{confronts the}} creature in the sewers. The Lizard learns Spider-Man's real identity via {{the name on}} an abandoned camera and follows Peter to school, where they fight. Police start a manhunt for both Spider-Man and the Lizard. The Police corner Spider-Man by taking off his mask and Captain Stacy discovers that Spider-Man is really Peter. The Lizard plans to make all humans lizard-like by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower, to eliminate the weaknesses he believes plague humanity. Spider-Man eventually disperses an antidote cloud instead, restoring Connors and earlier victims to normal, but not before the Lizard mortally wounds Captain Stacy. Before his death, Captain Stacy requests Peter avoid Gwen, {{in order to keep}} her safe. Peter initially does so, but later at school, suggests to Gwen he <b>may</b> <b>see</b> her after all.|$|E

30|$|Occasionally, pseudohypertrophy <b>may</b> be <b>seen</b> due to partial {{averaging}} {{of normal}} structures. This <b>may</b> be <b>seen</b> {{due to a}} prominent moderator band, which may give a false impression of septal hypertrophy (Movies 1 and 2).|$|R
5|$|The terns are {{birds of}} open {{habitats}} that typically breed in noisy colonies and {{lay their eggs}} on bare ground {{with little or no}} nest material. Marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats, and a few species build simple nests in trees, on cliffs or in crevices. The white tern, uniquely, lays its single egg on a bare tree branch. Depending on the species, one to three eggs make up the clutch. Most species feed on fish caught by diving from flight, but the marsh terns are insect-eaters, and some large terns will supplement their diet with small land vertebrates. Many terns are long-distance migrants, and the Arctic tern <b>may</b> <b>see</b> more daylight in a year than any other animal.|$|E

25|$|An object offers as much {{resistance}} to the air as the air does to the object.

Again you <b>may</b> <b>see</b> the air in motion over the sea, fill the swelling sails and drive heavily laden ships. From these instances, and the reasons given, a man with wings large enough and duly connected might learn to overcome {{the resistance of the}} air, and by conquering it, succeed in subjugating it and rising above it.|$|E
