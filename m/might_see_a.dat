5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
25|$|Pericutaneous space: The space {{just outside}} our bodies but {{which might be}} near to {{touching}} it. Visual-tactile perceptive fields overlap in processing this space. For example, an individual <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> feather as not touching their skin but still experience the sensation of being tickled when it hovers just above their hand. Other examples include the blowing of wind, gusts of air, and the passage of heat.|$|E

Average lows range from [...] in Key West to near [...] degrees Fahrenheit at Tallahassee, while daytime highs range from [...] at Tallahassee to [...] at Miami. [...] Predominant {{tropical}} easterly winds across {{central and southern}} Florida keep temperatures warm during the winter. Occasional strong cold fronts move southward down the peninsula with freezing or near freezing temperatures on a few nights into inland areas of central Florida every few years. A few times each decade Miami <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> winter night fall below 45 F. El Niño winters tend to be cooler due to increased cloud cover, but tend to have fewer freezes.|$|E

500|$|Film {{producer}} Joel Silver {{has said}} that after working as scriptwriters on Assassins, the Wachowskis made Bound as an [...] "audition piece" [...] {{to prove that they}} knew what to do on a movie set. Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Joel [...] "made that up." [...] The Wachowskis themselves claim they [...] "decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut." [...] They had the idea to write a story about how one <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong. They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because {{those are the kinds of}} films that they like to watch. Seeing film noir as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.|$|E
2500|$|Extinction as {{a result}} of climate change has been {{confirmed}} by fossil studies. Particularly, the extinction of amphibians during the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, 305 million years ago. A 2003 review across 14 biodiversity research centers predicted that, because of climate change, 15–37% of land species would be [...] "committed to extinction" [...] by 2050. The ecologically rich areas that would potentially suffer the heaviest losses include the Cape Floristic Region, and the Caribbean Basin. These areas <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> doubling of present carbon dioxide levels and rising temperatures that could eliminate 56,000 plant and 3,700 animal species.|$|E
2500|$|Yet {{also other}} Berbers <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> chance for {{betterment}} if not liberation {{in the wake}} of Rome's slide toward disorder. Living within the empire in urban poverty or as rural laborers, or living beyond its frontiers as independent pastoralists primarily but also as tillers of the soil, were Berbers who might find new political-economic opportunities in Rome's decline, e.g., access to better land and trading terms. The consequent absence of Imperial authority at the periphery soon led to the emergence of new Berber polities. These arose not along the sea coast in the old Imperial cities, but centered inland at the borderland (the limes) of empire, between the steppe and the sown. This [...] "pre-Sahara" [...] geographic and cultural zone ran along the mountainous frontier, the Tell, hill country and upland plains, which separated the [...] "well-watered, Mediterranean districts of the Maghreb to the north, from the Sahara desert to the south." [...] Here Berber tribal chiefs acted through force and negotiation to establish a new source of governing authority.|$|E

2500|$|As Billy Pilgrim becomes [...] "unstuck in time," [...] he {{is faced}} with {{a new type of}} philosophy. When Pilgrim becomes acquainted with the Tralfamadorians, he learns a {{different}} viewpoint concerning fate and free will. While Christianity may state that fate and free will are matters of God’s divine choice and human interaction, Tralfamadorianism would disagree. According to Tralfamadorian philosophy, things are and always will be, and there is nothing that can change them. When Billy asks why they had chosen him, the Tralfamadorians reply, [...] "Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything? Because this moment simply is." [...] The mindset of the Tralfamadorian is not one in which fate and free will exist. Things happen because they were always destined to be happening. The narrator of the story explains that the Tralfamadorians see time all at once. This concept of time is best explained by the Tralfamadorians themselves, as they speak to Billy Pilgrim on the matter stating, [...] "I am a Tralfamadorian, seeing all time as you <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> stretch of the Rocky Mountains. All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simply is." [...] After this particular conversation on seeing time, Billy makes the statement that this philosophy does not seem to evoke any sense of free will. To this, the Tralfamadorian reply that free will is a concept that, out of the [...] "visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe" [...] and [...] "studied reports on one hundred more," [...] exists solely on Earth.|$|E
