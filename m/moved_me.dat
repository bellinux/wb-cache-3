25|$|The rectorate was {{an attempt}} to see {{something}} in the movement that had come to power, beyond all its failings and crudeness, that was much more far-reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the Germans' Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at the time I believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what <b>moved</b> <b>me</b> to accept the rectorate.|$|E

500|$|In 2005 Black {{released}} Drinkin' Songs and Other Logic. [...] Black {{chose the}} title of the album to limit himself to simple topics in his past. He explained: [...] "I went out and bought all the music I grew up on that I didn't already have and spent three months listening to only that. Only stuff from before I started making records, so it was pre-1989—Waylon, Willie, Buck Owens, Haggard, Don Williams, Jim Croce. And what I discovered was a simplicity in song that I had moved away from. It was quite an emotional journey because these were all the songs that <b>moved</b> <b>me</b> and inspired me to do what I've been doing ever since." ...|$|E

In an interview entitled [...] "My Life in a Bush League", he criticized his fellow players, coaches, and NBA administrators. Chamberlain later commented {{that he could}} see in hindsight how the interview could have been instrumental in hurting his public image. However, contemporary colleagues were often terrified to play against Chamberlain. Bill Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain, Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court [...] "comical", and when 6ft 11in 250-pound (in his early years) Hall-of-Fame center Bob Lanier was asked about the most memorable moment of his career, Lanier answered: [...] "When Wilt Chamberlain lifted me up and <b>moved</b> <b>me</b> like a coffee cup so he could get a favorable position." ...|$|E

Salinger really opened my eyes as to how you can weave fiction out {{of a set of}} events that seem almost unconnected, or very lightly connected... stick in my mind as really having <b>moved</b> <b>me</b> a step up, as it were, toward knowing how to handle my own material."

500|$|Harvey {{has also}} {{recorded}} two studio albums with long-time collaborator John Parish. Dance Hall at Louse Point (1996) was written collectively with Parish {{with the exception}} of the song [...] "Is That All There Is?", written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. The album also listed her as Polly Jean Harvey, which in part affected the album's sales.

[...] In 1998, she also performed lead vocals on [...] "Airplane Blues," [...] as a soundtrack accompaniment to the Wingwalkers art exhibition by Rebecca Goddard and Parish's wife, Michelle Henning, which was released as the closing song on Parish's second solo album How Animals Move in 2002. Following the release of White Chalk, Harvey reunited with Parish to record A Woman a Man Walked By, released in March 2009. Like Dance Hall at Louse Point, the album received positive reviews but also was a moderate commercial success, peaking at number 25 in the UK Albums Chart.|$|E
500|$|... "Siempre Tú" [...] was {{composed}} by Muñiz in Los Angeles {{along with its}} producers Nico Stadi and Mike Green. It was recorded {{in the same city}} at the Pulse Music Group Studios. The idea of the song came to Muñiz after he started to say phrases [...] "like when you think about your girlfriend" [...] accompanied by a piano and an electric guitar. In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I feel that it is a very Californian song [...] because it is a more proactive and current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song <b>moved</b> <b>me</b> a lot". On another occasion, he added, [...] "We wanted to do a song with which you can tell a person that you miss her, that you are always thinking about her and longing to be with her. This was the idea of the track". Stan and Muñiz were linked by producer Gabriel Huiban, who previously worked with the latter. [...] "Siempre Tú" [...] was released worldwide on 21 April 2017 through Warner Music Mexico.

A voracious reader, he read books while working in the mine, in between hauling loads of coal. He became interested in theology and began speaking at age 18 as a lay preacher in local Methodist churches. He studied at Richmond College of the University of London and at Wesley College seminary. While a seminarian in 1888, he heard Catherine Booth of the Salvation Army speak in London, recalling years later, [...] "I have not heard since anything which <b>moved</b> <b>me</b> more deeply than that remarkable address [...] [...] [...] delivered in the purest English, with faultless diction, in a voice like the pealing of a silver bell across a still lake." ...|$|E

Because of energy {{absorbing}} walls, Busch was uninjured, but waved angrily towards Bowyer under caution and showed discontent with Bowyer in post-race ceremonies. In regards to the incident with Bowyer, Busch said [...] "That was a terrible way to end {{what could have been a}} decent night. We struggled at times to get the balance of the Haas Automation Chevrolet right, but we kind of found our spot just past the halfway point and made slight adjustments the rest of the way. We called for a two-tire stop at the end hoping to gain some track position, but it seemed like everyone had the same idea. We gained a little, but the guys behind us all had four tires. I tried to hold them off the best I could, but someone (Bowyer) <b>moved</b> <b>me</b> out of their way and it ruined our night.

I heard a record of hers Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues in a record store, back when you could listen to records {{right there in the}} store. Right then and there, I went out and traded my electric guitar and amplifier for an acoustical guitar, a flat-top Gibson.... just something vital and personal. I learned all the songs on that record"; Joan Baez, who said, [...] "Odetta was a goddess. Her passion <b>moved</b> <b>me.</b> I learned everything she sang"; Janis Joplin, who [...] "spent much of her adolescence listening to Odetta, who was also the first person Janis imitated when she started singing"; the poet Maya Angelou, who once said, [...] "If only one could be sure that every 50 years a voice and a soul like Odetta's would come along, the centuries would pass so quickly and painlessly we would hardly recognize time"; John Waters, whose original screenplay for Hairspray mentions her as an influence on beatniks; and Carly Simon, who cited Odetta as a major influence and told of [...] "going weak in the knees" [...] when she had the opportunity to meet her in Greenwich Village.|$|E
2500|$|While {{creating}} {{lyrics and}} melodies for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kiedis has drawn {{from various sources}} for inspiration. [...] His first musical memory was hearing Neil Young's [...] "Heart of Gold" [...] at age eleven: [...] "It <b>moved</b> <b>me</b> so much that I insisted my mother buy me the 45." [...] In high school, he was highly influenced by the rap-style vocals of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's [...] "The Message" [...] and the [...] "in-your-face sexual lyrics" [...] of Prince's [...] "Dirty Mind". Kiedis writes most of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' lyrics. Starting with 1989's Mother's Milk album, John Frusciante and Flea have written {{nearly all of the}} music (excluding melodies) for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, while Kiedis adds lyrics and melodies he hears during instrumental jams by his bandmates. Kiedis said in 2006, [...] "Somehow I find songs... in the bigness of what they're doing." [...] His lyrical style has varied over the years. During the band's early years, Kiedis wrote many lyrics detailing his enjoyment of sex, drugs, and life in Los Angeles. As his musical tastes expanded and his outlook on life changed, he began writing songs about a wider spectrum of subjects. His lyrics include many of the same themes as the writings of Charles Bukowski, Kiedis' main literary influence.|$|E
