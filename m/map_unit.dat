25|$|The intercrater plains {{material}} {{is the oldest}} recognizable <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> in the Borealis region. It lies between large craters from about long 155° to long 190° W., and it also occurs between clusters of closely packed and overlapping large craters west of crater Gauguin and south and southeast of crater Mansart. The unit was described originally by Trask and Guest, who considered {{it to be the}} most widespread unit on Mercury; Strom reported that this material covers one-third of the surface viewed by Mariner 10. The principal morphologic characteristic of the intercrater plains {{material is}} the high density of superposed craters 5 to 10 km in diameter, which are commonly shallow and elongate; probably they are secondary craters derived from nearby large primary craters that are superposed on the unit. As one group, the large craters and associated intercrater plains form some of the heavily cratered terrain defined by Trask and Guest.|$|E
2500|$|The rolling to hummocky plains {{that lie}} between large craters {{in the southeastern}} part of the {{quadrangle}} make up the oldest recognizable <b>map</b> <b>unit,</b> the intercrater plains material. The plains were originally described as intercrater by Trask and Guest, who noted their level to gently rolling appearance and their general lack of well-defined craters larger than about 50km in diameter. Malin showed the plains to contain highly eroded remnants of large craters and basins that are only very shallow circular depressions. These intercrater plains are, however, marked by a very high density of superposed craters that are small (5–10km diameter), elongate, shallow, and probably secondary to the many large craters superposed on the plains. Superposition of crater ejecta over parts of intercrater plains in other areas indicates that some large craters formed in a preexisting intercrater plains unit. On the other hand, the intercrater plains material partly postdates {{some of the major}} cratering events on Mercury, according to apparent superposition relations. In particular, the unit appears to overlap the entire northwest side of the Tolstoj Basin, a feature indicating that the intercrater plains in this region probably do not represent the remains of the primordial surface of the planet. A complex history of contemporaneous craters and plains formation is therefore suggested. A detailed discussion of the origin of the intercrater plains on the Moon and Mercury was given by Strom.|$|E

40|$|Andrew R. Aandahl {{provides}} a visual and descriptive {{overview of the}} soils of the Great Plains, a region that accounts for approximately one-third of the cropland and one-half of the grassland pasture in the United States. Its soils are a basic resource for the region 2 ̆ 7 s productivity. Aandahl examines this soil resource in seventy high-quality color photographs of soil profiles and associated landscapes, accompanied by a text that thoroughly describes and classifies the soils. In addition, the soils of the Great Plains are delineated on a map that accompanies the book. The 195 <b>mapping</b> <b>units</b> are color coded {{in order to identify}} soil-moisture and soil-temperature conditions used in the soil classification system. To understand soil conditions in a given area, the reader first identifies the appropriate <b>mapping</b> <b>unit</b> by number and then refers to the description of this unit in the text. Here, information is given about soil series within the <b>mapping</b> <b>unit</b> as well as land use and principal crops or grasses. In the descriptions of many of the <b>mapping</b> <b>units,</b> certain soil series, identified by boldface type, are illustrated with color photographs. Other soil series within the <b>mapping</b> <b>units</b> are compared to the soils illustrated. In this manner, Aandahl leads the reader from the geographic pattern of the <b>mapping</b> <b>unit</b> to a visual perception of the soil and, thus, to the logic of the classification system used in identifying the <b>mapping</b> <b>unit.</b> In addition, the text outlines the major agricultural uses of soils within the unit and estimates the potential productivity of native grasslands. The map of the soils of the Great Plains that accompanies the book was published in 1972, ten years prior to the publication of the book. Advances in soil classification during that time have resulted in a few revisions in the names of the <b>mapping</b> <b>units</b> listed on the map legend.

The term is used to describe 1) the geographical area described above and the type area for 2) a stratigraphic or geologic <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> (e.g. formation) called the Olympia Undae unit. As a stratigraphic unit, Olympia Undae describes materials that make up the geographic Olympia Undae as well as other sand sheets and dune fields encircling Planum Boreum (e.g., Abalos Undae). The Olympia Undae unit is Amazonian in age. To address some of this confusion, the stratigraphic term Olympia Undae unit has recently been renamed to simply [...] "undae unit," [...] since it encompasses other named dune fields (undae) around Planum Boreum. Another possible source of confusion is the distinction between Olympia Undae and Olympia Planum (formerly, Olympia Planitia). As a geographic area, Olympia Undae refers to the erg that covers a large fraction of Olympia Planum between longitude 120° and 240°E. Olympia Undae and Olympia Planum are not interchangeable terms. Olympia Planum is a broad, plain (and topographic bench) adjacent to Planum Boreum. It is half-domed shaped in profile (cross-section) and slopes southward into the Vastitas Borealis.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The {{variability}} of selected physical, chemical, and morphological soil properties in two landtype mapping units on'the Rogue River National Forest in southwestern Oregon was studied. The {{objectives of the}} study were (i) to quantify soil variability in several soil resource inventory mapping units, (ii) to explore methods of describing soil variability in order to make soil map information more useful to the map user, and (iii) to attempt to identify sources of variability. Two mapping units, in the Siskyou and Cascade Mountains, were selected to represent extremes of internal variability. Eight delineations of each <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> were sampled with randomly located transects for a total of 40 sites per <b>map</b> <b>unit.</b> Soil properties exhibited various types of frequency distributions. Normal, skewed, and multi-modal distributions were observed. Nearly half the property-horizon combinations measured in both map units had normal distributions. Chemical properties, such as extractable bases, were consistently positively skewed or approximately log-normal. Square root and logarithmic transformations of the data normalized these distributions and stabilized the variance. These results suggested that for multi-modal and badly skewed populations, assumption of a normal distribution may lead to considerable error if the arithmetic mean and standard deviation are used for predictive purposes. <b>Map</b> <b>unit</b> 74 in the Siskyou Mountains was considered to be more variable, over most properties measured, than <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 33 from the Cascades. For most properties coefficients of variation (CV) were higher, the sample requirements to estimate population means were greater, and the ranges were wider in <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 74, as compared to <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 33. In both map units, chemical properties were more variable than physical or morphological properties, which were about equal in their variability. The number of samples required to estimate the means of properties varied widely and were often prohibitively large (264 for organic matter in the surface of <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 74). This number could be reduced if the sampling scheme was stratified using estimates of within and between delineation variance. Between 50 and 75 percent of the total variation in most properties of both map units occurred within delineations. This result is desireable from a management and broad planning perspective and tends to support the validity of the map units as designed and mapped. When tested by analysis of variance, most properties in both map units had significantly different delineation means. These differences could often be traced to one particular delineation and were many times not of practical significance. Large or small changes in the values of most properties were found to be as likely to occur at 660 foot separation distances as at 15 foot distances. This tends to indicate a random distribution of variation, when distance alone is considered, which could have important consequences when attempting to characterize soil properties for management interpretations or site evaluations. Chemical properties expressed volumetrically were more variable than the same properties expressed on a weight basis. Volumetric chemical concentrations were greater in <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 74 than in <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 33, the reverse of the relationship found with those properties on a weight basis. The proportions of within delineation variance in <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 74 increased as a result of conversion to volumetric concentrations. Use of principal components analysis confirmed the chemical properties as contributing greater amounts of variation than the physical or morphological properties. Ordination of sites along axes of selected factors also confirmed the general uniformity of the map units as well as the greater {{variability of}} <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 74...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{results showed}} that {{plasmids}} containing {{one of the eight}} putative origins (ori's) of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) are replicated after transfection into Spodoptera frugiperda cells if essential trans-acting factors are supplied by AcMNPV infection (Kool et al., Virology, 192, 94 - 101, 1993 a; Kool et al., J. Gen. Virol., in press, 1993 b; Leisy and Rohrmann, Virology, 196, 722 - 730, 1993). In this report a transient complementation assay is described in which four cotransfected cosmid clones, instead of AcMNPV infection, provided essential trans-acting factors for plasmid DNA replication. In this assay plasmid replication was found to be independent of the presence, in cis, of a viral ori. No replication of plasmids occurred when one of the cosmids was omitted from the transfection mixture. This result indicated that this assay is a valid approach for identification of AcMNPV replication genes. We further used the assay to define essential regions in the four required cosmids. Six regions of the AcMNPV genome, EcoRI-I (<b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 0. 3 - 5. 8), EcoRI-O (<b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 6. 9 - 8. 7), SstI-F (<b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 38. 9 - 45. 0), EcoRI-D (<b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 59. 9 - 68. 3), a BamHI-SstII fragment of BamHI-B (<b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 84. 3 - 89. 7), and EcoRI-B (<b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 90. 0 - 100), with at least seven genes, were found to be essential for plasmid DNA replication.
