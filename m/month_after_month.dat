500|$|As {{was common}} with Pixar features, the {{production}} became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer. Still, Toy Story 2, with its highly compressed production schedule, was especially trying. While {{hard work and}} long hours were common to the team by that point (especially so to Lasseter), running flat-out on Toy Story 2 for <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>month</b> began to take a toll. The overwork spun out into carpal tunnel syndrome for some animators, and repetitive strain injuries for others. Catmull would later disclose that [...] "a full third of the staff" [...] ended up with some form of RSI {{by the time the}} film was finished. Pixar did not encourage long hours, and, in fact, set limits on how many hours employees could work by approving or disapproving overtime. Employees' self-imposed compulsions to excel often trumped any other constraints, and were especially common to younger employees. In one instance, an animator had forgotten to drop his child off at daycare one morning and, in a mental haze, forgot the baby {{in the back seat of}} his car in the parking lot. [...] "Although quick action by rescue workers headed off the worst, the incident became a horrible indicator that some on the crew were working too hard," [...] wrote David Price in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch.|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, The Hollywood Reporter {{revealed}} that Jon Bernthal and Andrew Lincoln were chosen by producers {{for the main}} cast of the series. Bernthal was to portray Shane Walsh, while Lincoln provided the role of Rick Grimes, the central character of The Walking Dead. While Hurd didn't expect to cast Lincoln, Kirkman was ecstatic with his acting, evaluating him as an [...] "amazing find". In his interview with Dread Central, Kirkman added that [...] "writing Rick Grimes <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>month</b> in the comic series, I {{had no idea he}} was an actual living, breathing human being, and yet, here he is. I couldn't be more thrilled with how this show is coming together." [...] Although he was initially shocked upon hearing of The Walking Dead, Lincoln thought the episode's script was well written. [...] "I read it and thought it was well written, and I put myself on tape just for one scene. I didn't know who was involved at this point." [...] The succeeding day, his agent called him about the development of the pilot. Lincoln described the moment as [...] "kind of like a dream list". He later communicated with Darabont via Skype; [...] "We spoke for about 40 minutes about his ideas for the project, about what I liked about Episode One and then he asked would I fly over to come and test." [...] Lincoln flew to Darabont's home, where he viewed [...] "Days Gone Bye" [...] in his garage. He opined that was [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "very intimate".|$|E

2500|$|In April 1927 the {{reservoir}} level {{was brought to}} within ten feet of the spillway, and during most of May the water level was within three feet of overflowing. There were no large changes {{in the amount of}} the seepage that was collected and, <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>month,</b> the pipe flowed about one-third full. This is an insignificant amount for a dam the size of the St. Francis, and on this subject Mulholland said, [...] "Of all the dams I have built and of all the dams I have ever seen, it was the driest dam of its size I ever saw."

2500|$|G. K. Chesterton, one of Dickens's {{critics in}} the early 20th century, {{expressed}} the opinion that Mr. Boffin's pretended fall into miserliness was originally intended by Dickens to be authentic, but that Dickens ran out of time and so took refuge in the awkward pretence that Boffin had been acting. Chesterton argues that while we might believe Boffin could be corrupted, we can hardly believe he could keep up such a strenuous pretence of corruption: [...] "Such a character as his—rough, simple and lumberingly unconscious—might be more easily conceived as really sinking in self-respect and honour than as keeping up, <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>month,</b> so strained and inhuman a theatrical performance. ... It might have taken years to turn Noddy Boffin into a miser; {{but it would have}} taken centuries to turn him into an actor." [...] However, Chesterton also praised the book as being a return to Dickens's youthful optimism and creative exuberance, full of characters who [...] "have that great Dickens quality of being something which is pure farce and yet which is not superficial; an unfathomable farce—a farce that goes down to the roots of the universe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of the Mollies were {{miners and}} {{the mode of}} working the mines lent itself to their {{peculiar}} policy. Miners were paid by the cubic yard, by the mine car, or by the ton, and (in the driving of entries) by the lineal yard. In the assignment of places, which {{was made by the}} mining boss, there were [...] "soft" [...] jobs and hard. If a Molly applied for a soft job and was refused, his anger was aroused and not infrequently in due time the offending boss was murdered. If he got employment, there was a constant chance of disagreement in measuring-up the work and in estimating the quality of the coal mined, for it was the custom to dock the miners' wages for bad coal with too much slate and dirt, and a serious disagreement was apt to be followed by violence. Little wonder was it that, as the source of the outrages was well understood, mining bosses refused to employ Irishmen, but this did not ensure their safety, as they might then be murdered for their refusal. A good Superintendent of any colliery would, in his quality of superior officer, support an efficient mining boss and would thus fall under the ban himself. John T. Morse, Jr., who made a contemporaneous study of the Molly Maguires, wrote in his vivid account of their operations: [...] "The superintendents and 'bosses' in the collieries could all rest assured that their days would not be long in the land. Everywhere and at all times they were attacked, beaten, and shot down, by day and by night; <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>month</b> and year after year, on the public highways and in their own homes, in solitary places and in the neighborhood of crowds, these doomed men continued to fall in frightful succession beneath the hands of assassins." ...|$|E

After scrrening for enrollment, to 40 patients (79 eyes with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension), new fixed combination travoprost 0. 004 %/timolol 0. 5 % was prescribed once {{a day in the}} evening (PM). Patients were enrolled according to each investigator decision on indication for travoprost 0. 004 %/timolol 0. 5 % fixed combination once a day, without washout period after previous medication. Intraocular pressure was measured at 9 AM at all time control points: at baseline, <b>after</b> 1 <b>month,</b> <b>after</b> 3 <b>months</b> and <b>after</b> 6 <b>month.</b> <b>After</b> 1 <b>month,</b> screening for nonresponders (criteria: 20 % intraocular pressure lowering) and subjects with major side effects was performed. At second control visit, <b>after</b> 3 <b>months</b> PM dosing, intraocular pressure was measured and patients were instructed to continue once a day the same medication, but in the morning (AM) for consequent 3 <b>months.</b> <b>After</b> 1 <b>month,</b> reduction in mean intraocular pressure value was 21. 66 %. At the visit <b>after</b> 3 <b>month,</b> the mean intraocular pressure was 15. 67 ± 2. 17 mm Hg (reduction 21. 14 %). 3 <b>month</b> <b>after</b> dosing regimen changed to AM (6 <b>month</b> <b>after</b> beginning of travoprost 0. 004 %/timolol 0. 5 % combination therapy), reduction in intraocular pressure value was 19. 86 %. The differences (mean±standard deviation) in intraocular pressure values after 1, 3 nad 6 month were all highly statistically significant compared to baseline values. The tolerability was evaluated in five steps (Likert scale) ranging from unsatisfactory to excellent by both patient and investigator – taken at 3 and 6 month control visit. 95 % of patients and 100 % of investigators were satisfied with the possibility of choosing dosing regimen for travoprost 0. 004 %/timolol 0. 5 % fixed combination. Travoprost 0. 004 %/timolol 0. 5 % fixed combination proved sufficient intraocular pressure control dosed either PM or AM with no statistically significant difference between two dosing regimens. Possibility to choose between two dosing regimens gives each practitioner additional reassurance that glaucoma therapy will be individualised to needs of each patient...|$|R
