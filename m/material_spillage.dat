40|$|Background: Infertility is {{a complex}} {{disorder}} with significant medical, psychological and economic problems. Aims: The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate the structural abnormalities of the uterus and fallopian tubes in infertile women as elucidated by hysterosalpingography. Setting and Design: A retrospective study, conducted at the Radiology and Obstetric and Gynaecologic Departments of a tertiary health care institution. Materials and Methods: Evaluation of all consecutive patients in whom hysterosalpingographic (HSG) was performed for infertility between July 2013 and June 2015 in the Department of Radiology. For the biodata, indications for the investigation and the HSG findings were obtained. Statistical Analysis: The data were analyzed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows, version 20 software. Results: A total of 299 patients were evaluated. Of these, 250 were for infertility with primary and secondary infertility constituting 18. 4 and 81. 6 %, respectively. Seventy percent of the cases for infertility had abnormalities on the HSG. Normal uterine cavity was found in 123 (49. 2 %) cases. Uterine filling defects were the most common uterine abnormality. Fallopian tube occlusion, loculated contrast <b>material</b> <b>spillage</b> and hydrosalpinx were more common on the right, and bilateral tubal occlusion was seen only in 11. 2 %. All cases of intravasation were associated with either unilateral or bilateral fallopian tube blockage or irregularity of the uterus. Conclusion: There was a high incidence of tubal disease in the women presenting with infertility. This was commonly as a result of infection and inflammatory process. This study showed that HSG is very vital in detecting birth canal pathologies; hence, the facility for this important procedure, especially fluoroscopy, should be made available in the health centres for adequate assessment of the women with infertility...|$|E
40|$|Fluid {{power systems}} have been {{extensively}} used in off highway applications like skid steer loaders, wheel loaders, excavators since many years. Work {{has been done by}} both industry and academia to improve efficiency, reduce noise and leakages in these systems. With increasing competition in the market, importance is now also given to operator comfort and machine productivity in off highway applications. ^ Mobile, off – highway vehicles like Skid-steer loaders are widely used in labour saving applications like loading earth into a truck, dig and move material on construction sites to, clean roads, clear snow from roads etc. To carry out these jobs in limited spaces, skid steer loaders need tight turning radius. For this reason, these machines have a short wheelbase which prevents the use of suspensions in these vehicles. The absence of a suspension system exposes the vehicle to ground vibrations of high magnitude and low frequency. Vibrations reduce operator comfort, productivity and life of components. This thesis will discuss control strategies for vibration damping of skid steer loader using the hydraulic boom cylinder as the active suspension element, which is equivalent to a spring–damper. Along with vibrations, the machine productivity is also hampered by <b>material</b> <b>spillage</b> which is caused by the tilting of the bucket due to the extension of the boom. This dissertation will discuss the development of a robust path-planning control algorithm which adapts to the position of the boom to maintain a level load to achieve bucket self-leveling. Another reason for reduced productivity in skid steer loaders is slow in site travel speeds. This dissertation also concentrates on reducing the in-job cycle time by developing a control strategy to smooth speed shift the drive motors keeping the pump flow constant. ^ To synthesize these proposed control algorithms, high fidelity hydraulic and mechanical models of the skid steer loader are created. Ultimately, the control algorithms derived in this dissertation help in improving operator comfort and machine productivity. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{is a key}} step of {{quantitative}} risk analysis (QRA) to estimate ignition probability of flammable materials after leakage accidents. This paper reviews the available literature and expert opinion on how to evaluate and determine ignition probability value, and it was detailedly discussed on the main influencing factors of ignition probability, including flammable material properties, mass flow rate of flammable <b>materials</b> <b>spillage,</b> ignition resources and ignition controls. Moreover, the operational and practical ignition probability value could be estimated from the all way of classifications of flammable material, mass flow rate, ignition resources, hazardous areas and ignition prevention and control measure. Furthermore, the more practical ignition probability model was put forward that the ignition probability was the maximum value of the probability decided by material properties (PMP), mass flow rate(PQ) and ignition resources(PIS) with the factor of preventing and controlling ignition (KIC). Finally, the further research was proposed to assign some feasible weigh factors of the ignition probability for flammable materials after leakage accidents...|$|R

With this method, the cyst {{was placed in the}} impermeable bag and only then punctured and aspirated, being contained inside the protective bag. Any <b>spillage</b> <b>material</b> is securely contained inside the bag, which avoids any risk from spilled material. The deflated cyst within the endobag was extracted via the 10 -mm trocar sleeve. In the last group, a posterior colpotomy was performed, with attention not to lose much of the pneumoperitoneum. The cyst or adnexa was easily delivered via the vagina.|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. (Engineering Management) In {{a tender}} bid to energy and {{chemical}} company Sasol, {{a request to}} offer a technical solution for a two-flight overland conveyor system whose function is to transport coal from a 15 000 tonne bunker into an external stockpile storage facility in the plant was made. This conveyor consisted of two conveyor flight sections of lengths 18 423 m and 8 537 m each. The prospect of combining the two flights of conveyors to form one, super-efficient conveyor structure with additional cost saving benefits was identified. It was found that this occurrence was not unique to the individual project as other researching engineers have been faced with similar problems before [18]. This then lead the researcher into believing {{that there could be}} some advantage in investigating the possible benefits to the overall cost, maintainability and scheduling of the fabrication and erection activities for the entire project of combining the multiple flight conveyors into a single-flight conveyor. It is also the conviction of the researcher that the achieved outcomes will prove beneficial to the bulk materials handling industry as a whole. The problem is traditionally short, multiple flight conveyors have always been used for performing the function of transporting bulk material from one location in a mining plant to another hence; long, single-flight overland conveyors of lengths exceeding 26 km have not been commonly installed. In this dissertation the possibility of employing a single-flight overland as opposed to a two-flight conveyor in the Sasol Impumelelo coal plant is investigated. This is done against the work of other researchers who have conducted similar studies in the field as well as by utilizing project-specific data using applicable industry standards as well as Engineering Management course theory. By employing actual project procurement and engineering design data; the investigation is done by calculating and comparing the individual capital and operational costs that encompass the total cost of ownership (TCO) for both conveyor systems as well as the two systems’ reliability, availability and maintainability to establish each system’s complete life cycle costs. It is the opinion of the researcher that the investigation method is valid as it is in line with the guidelines given by The Miami University of Ohio [24] as well as J Hanek [25] and thus provides the researcher with a plausible technique for establishing which between the single-flight overland conveyor and two-flight overland conveyor configurations is overall the more superior system to install. It was found that even though its initial capital and operational costs are higher; the single-flight conveyor system is more reliable, readily available and cheaper to run and sustain over the 30 year expected life-span of the plant. It also is less labour intensive to perform maintenance on, yields less material degradation and results in less <b>material</b> <b>spillage</b> because of the elimination of additional transfer points and transfer towers. These results can be taken as valid on a global scale, for any mining plant, not restricted to any specific material as they are not subject to South African temperature, altitude or seismic conditions nor are they constrained to the type of bulk material being mined...|$|E
30|$|In case {{spillage}} occurred, {{we immediately}} resorted to vigorous jet-wash suction irrigation using warm Ringer’s solution. We used two wide-bore suction irrigation cannulae simultaneously from both secondary puncture sites. This ensured rapid and immediate clean up of spilled material and avoided any {{spread to the}} upper abdomen and contact with viscera. A copious amount of fluid was utilized—no less than 8 – 12 l (up to 24 bottles of half-liter solution). Additionally, avoiding Trendelenburg’s position helped keep any <b>spillage</b> <b>material</b> confined and collected in the cul-de-sac, with no spread to upper abdomen. Indeed, suction irrigation consumed most of the surgery time, but we found it of paramount importance to achieve the goals of clean surgery and avoidance of chemical peritonitis. The evacuated cyst, together with its contents were shelled out from normal ovarian tissues and removed via the trocar sleeve. We had to replace the 5 -mm trocar with a 10 -mm one after dilatation of port of entry to facilitate tissue retrieval.|$|R
40|$|Packaging is {{a complex}} subject and its role to the food {{industry}} and to the consumers includes protection, containment, transportation, preservation, and advertisement to the food industry. Defective packaging {{has the potential of}} negating all the food processor has attempted to accomplish by the most meticulous method of manufacturing processes. Nigerians have diverse ready-to-eat foods, diet and drinks varying from one tribe and geographical locations to another, with different packing materials and methods adopted. The aim of this work is to appraise the various properties of the local food packaging material used in Nigeria with particular reference to its suitability to the packaged food. A survey was carried out to ascertain the various type of local packaging materials used in Nigeria; samples of locally prepared and packaged foods were purchased from various sales outlets in Ogbomoso town, southwest Nigeria; the samples were stored at room temperature. Results shows that the common type of materials used to package food in Nigeria includes discarded bottles and jars, old stock of paper prints, leaves, maize-sheath, glass-sided boxes, jute sacks, poly sacks, polyethylene bags among others. The advantages of these materials includes availability and low cost price; while the disadvantage includes easy contamination of packaged food,easy deterioration of packaging <b>materials,</b> easy <b>spillage</b> of packaged products, poor shelf-life of packaged food among others. It is observed that the role of packaging is not accomplished in the use of these materials; also no standard of regulatory body has been effective in ensuring the safety of readyto-eat food...|$|R

Remediation strategies must be designed to support high throughput while keeping costs to a minimum. Biosorption is presented {{as an alternative to}} traditional physicochemical means for removing toxic metals from wastewater. We have investigated the metal binding qualities of two biomass byproducts that are commercially available in quantity and at low cost, namely "spillage", a dried yeast and plant mixture from the production of ethanol from corn, and ground corn cobs used in animal feeds. The biomass materials effectively removed toxic metals, such as Cu, Cs, Mo, Ni, Pb, and Zn, even in the presence of competing metals likely to be found in sulfide mine tailing ponds. The effectiveness of these biosorbents was demonstrated using samples from the Berkeley Pit in Montana. Investigations included column chromatography and slurry systems, and linear distribution coefficients are presented. X-ray spectroscopy was used to identify the binding sites for metals adsorbed to the <b>spillage</b> <b>material.</b> The results of our experiments demonstrate that the biosorption of metals from wastewaters using biomass byproducts is a viable and cost-effective technology that should be included in process evaluations. peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Bulk {{materials}} handling is {{a rapidly growing}} global industry. Immense challenges exist to improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of transporting and handling bulk materials continuously. The nature and scale of bulk {{materials handling}} varies from country to country. This study specifically focuses on the handling of bulk materials in the mining sector. Within this industry, transfer chutes are a key component used for transferring bulk material from one conveyor to another. Among other uses {{it can also be}} used under hoppers or silos to transfer material to conveyors, trains, trucks or ships. In a continuous effort to improve the efficiency of processes the industry is bombarded with transfer chute problems that include: •	blocked chutes •	high wear of liner <b>materials</b> •	<b>spillage</b> due to skew loading •	conveyor belt wear at loading points. Thorough investigation of existing transfer points, before modifying or replacing them with another configuration, gives better insight into the problems. This aids the designer {{to come up with the}} optimum solution for a specific transfer point. In this dissertation a study is done on the configuration of dynamic chutes or hood and spoon chutes. After completing a detailed investigation of existing problems, the study focuses on rectifying material transfer problems and designing for ease of maintenance. Adding to the improved flow in the new design, for the specific case study discussed in this dissertation, other design details are discussed which further validates the new design. This design improves the wear life of the liners inside the chute and minimises down time by reducing maintenance shutdowns. There are literally endless possibilities when it comes to chute configurations due to the uniqueness of each plant, material type and layout constraints. It is therefore beneficial to know what issues to address in the process of chute design or optimisation. This study focuses on a specific case study with unique problems and solutions. It should however give further insight and a basic understanding of what a chute designer must consider, and the methods taken, to optimise an existing material transfer point. The purpose of this document is therefore not to provide the reader with a recipe for chute optimisation but rather with the knowledge to comprehend the problems and solutions by discussing a specific industry case study.
