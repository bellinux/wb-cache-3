25|$|A <b>master</b> <b>set</b> of over 200 {{lithographs}} by American realist painter George Wesley Bellows (1882–1925) {{is one of}} {{the highlights}} of the ACMAA’s works on paper collection. Leading American printmakers Martin Lewis (1881–1962), Louis Lozowick (1892-1973), and Reginald Marsh (1898-1954) are each represented by multiple examples of their graphic work. Also housed in the collection are early works by Edward Hopper (1882–1967) and a complete set of prints by modernist Stuart Davis (1892–1964). An early watercolor by Jacob Lawrence (1917–2000), acquired in 1987, marks the ascension of this important artist’s career.|$|E

[...] They spent many long hours together in the darkroom, and by 1956 they had produced what Weston called “The Project Prints”, eight sets of 8” × 10” prints from 830 of his negatives. [...] The only complete set today is housed at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Later that same year the Smithsonian Institution displayed nearly 100 of these prints at a major exhibit, “The World of Edward Weston”, paying tribute to his accomplishments in American photography.|$|E
2500|$|Opera seria {{acquired}} definitive form early {{during the}} 1720s. While Apostolo Zeno and Alessandro Scarlatti had paved the way, the genre only truly came to fruition due to Metastasio and later composers. Metastasio's career {{began with the}} serenata Gli Orti Esperidi ("The Gardens of the Hesperides"). Nicola Porpora, (much later to be Haydn's <b>master),</b> <b>set</b> the work to music, and the success {{was so great that}} the famed Roman prima donna, Marianna Bulgarelli, [...] "La Romanina", sought out Metastasio, and took him on as her protégé. Under her wing, Metastasio produced libretto after libretto, and they were rapidly set by the greatest composers in Italy and Austria, establishing the transnational tone of opera seria: Didone abbandonata, Catone in Utica, Ezio, Alessandro nell'Indie, Semiramide riconosciuta, Siroe and Artaserse. After 1730 he was settled in Vienna and turned out more librettos for the imperial theater, until the mid-1740s: Adriano, Demetrio, Issipile, Demofoonte, Olimpiade, La clemenza di Tito, Achille in Sciro, Temistocle, Il re pastore and what he regarded as his finest libretto, Attilio Regolo. For the librettos, Metastasio and his imitators customarily drew on dramas featuring classical characters from antiquity bestowed with princely values and morality, struggling with conflicts between love, honour and duty, in elegant and ornate language that could be performed equally well as both opera and non-musical drama. On the other hand, Handel, working far outside the mainstream genre, set only a few Metastasio libretti for his London audience, preferring a greater diversity of texts.|$|E

50|$|The Dragon Masters {{collection}} {{was released in}} August 1993. Majisto the Wizard (known as Merlin the Wizard outside of the U.S.) and his glow in the dark wand {{were introduced to the}} Castle series. This was the first time for Lego Castle to have a fantasy theme. The powerful wizard commanded his own organization of knights, the Dragon Masters. Their goal appeared to be the capture and possible taming (for use in battle) of fearsome fire breathing green dragons with red wings. The dragons were another new element to the series. The Dragon Master knights had newly designed faces, and were characterized by shields identical to the ovoid shields of the Black Knights except they featured a green dragon instead of the blue dragon. The Dragon Masters consisted of magic and mythical themes. The largest Dragon <b>Masters</b> <b>set</b> was 6082 Fire Breathing Fortress. Other main sets were 6048 Majisto's Magical Workshop and 6076 Dark Dragon's Den. The total number of Dragons included in the Dragon <b>Masters</b> <b>sets</b> was only three. In Europe and Asia, a total of seven Dragon <b>Masters</b> <b>sets</b> were released in 1993. But in North America, only four sets were released that same year. The remaining three sets, 6020 Magic Shop, 6043 Dragon Defender, and 6105 Medieval Knights were released in 1994. One possible reason why this occurred was because in 1994, no new castle sets were planned to be released. Therefore, it was decided that these sets would fill in the gap. Other smaller Dragon <b>Masters</b> <b>sets</b> were released in 1994, such as 1906 Majisto's Tower and 1794 Dragon Master Chariot but they were only mini castle sets. The last Dragon <b>Masters</b> <b>set</b> was 1736 Wizard's Cart that featured Majisto carrying his favorite wand and traveling with a cart (loaded with a treasure chest), in 1995. This marked the end of the Dragon Masters reign. But the Dragon <b>Masters</b> <b>sets</b> inspired other castle sets to have magic and fantasy themes such as the Fright Knights.|$|R

His legs were swathed and encumbered with grey; he made ineffectual movements with his sword. Grey streamers waved from him; there was a thin veil of grey across his face. With his left hand he beat at something on his body, and suddenly he stumbled and fell. He struggled to rise, and fell again, and suddenly, horribly, began to howl, [...] "Oh--ohoo, ohooh!" ...|$|E

60|$|Now Dame Ellesmere and Mistress Deborah had not by {{any means}} been {{formerly}} on so friendly a footing, as this haste to visit her might be supposed to intimate. But years had taught Deborah to forget and forgive; or perhaps she had no special objection, under cover of a visit to Dame Ellesmere, to take the chance of seeing what changes time had made on her old admirer the keeper. Both inhabitants were in the cottage when, after having seen her <b>master</b> <b>set</b> forth on his expedition to the Castle, Mistress Debbitch, dressed in her very best gown, footed it through gutter, and over stile, and by pathway green, to knock at their door, and to lift the hatch at the hospitable invitation which bade her come in.|$|E

60|$|Edward Sankey, who was {{regarded}} with envy by his schoolfellows, {{was the only}} home boarder at Hathorn's; for, as a general thing, the <b>master</b> <b>set</b> his face against the introduction of home boarders. They were, he considered, an element of disturbance; they carry tales {{to and from the}} school; they cause discontent among the other boys, and their parents are in the habit of protesting and interfering. Not, indeed, that parents in those days considered it in any way a hardship for their boys to suffer corporal punishment; they had been flogged at school, and they believed that they had learned their lessons all the better for it. Naturally the same thing would happen to their sons. Still mothers are apt to be weak and soft hearted, and therefore Mr. Hathorn objected to home boarders.|$|E

I used to look at the {{mountain}}-tops, and think she was as pure as they; and that she should have been making herself the talk of a fellow like that, and writing so sweet to me all the time!--No, my Lord, there's no excusing it; and 'twas her being gone after the rest that made it so bitter hard to me! If she had been true, I would have gone through fire and water to be an honest man worthy of her; but when I found how she had deceived me, it went hard with me to cut myself off from the wild mountain life that I'd got to love, and my poor niggers, that will hardly have so kind a <b>master</b> <b>set</b> over them.' ...|$|E
60|$|It was in {{this place}} that I first saw my hostess. She had drawn one of the skins forward {{and sat in the}} sun, leaning against a pillar. It was her dress that struck me first of all, for it was rich and brightly coloured, and shone out in that dusty {{courtyard}} with something of the same relief as the flowers of the pomegranates. At a second look it was her beauty of person that took hold of me. As she sat back--watching me, I thought, though with invisible eyes--and wearing at the same time an expression of almost imbecile good-humour and contentment, she showed a perfectness of feature and a quiet nobility of attitude that were beyond a statue's. I took off my hat to her in passing, and her face puckered with suspicion as swiftly and lightly as a pool ruffles in the breeze; but she paid no heed to my courtesy. I went forth on my customary walk a trifle daunted, her idol-like impassivity haunting me; and when I returned, although she was still in much the same posture, I was half surprised to see that she had moved as far as the next pillar, following the sunshine. This time, however, she addressed me with some trivial salutation, civilly enough conceived, and uttered in the same deep-chested, and yet indistinct and lisping tones, that had already baffled the utmost niceness of my hearing from her son. I answered rather at a venture; for not only did I fail to take her meaning with precision, but the sudden disclosure of her eyes disturbed me. They were unusually large, the iris golden like Felipe's, but the pupil at that moment so distended that they seemed almost black; and what affected me was not so much their size as (what was perhaps its consequence) the singular insignificance of their regard. A look more blankly stupid I have never met. My eyes dropped before it even as I spoke, and I went on my way upstairs to my own room, at once baffled and embarrassed. Yet when I came there and saw the face of the portrait, I was again reminded of the miracle of family descent. My hostess was, indeed, both older and fuller in person; her eyes were of a different colour; her face, besides, was not only free from the ill-significance that offended and attracted me in the painting; it was devoid of either good or bad--a moral blank expressing literally naught. And yet there was a likeness, not so much speaking as immanent, not so much in any particular feature as upon the whole. It should seem, I thought, as if when the <b>master</b> <b>set</b> his signature to that grave canvas, he had not only caught the image of one smiling and false-eyed woman, but stamped the essential quality of a race.|$|E
