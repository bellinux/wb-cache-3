The analysis of <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> based on the activity of agonist-antagonist (AA) muscle pairs may provide insight into such transformations, especially for a reference frame in the muscle space. In this study, we examined the AA concept using the following explanatory variables: the AA ratio, which is related to the equilibrium-joint angle, and the AA sum, which is associated with joint stiffness. We formulated <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> as a function of AA sums, positing that <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> are composite units of mechanical impedance. The AA concept can be regarded as another form of the equilibrium-point (EP) hypothesis, and it can be extended to the concept of EP-based synergies.

40|$|AIM: Previous {{experiments}} {{have suggested that}} the CNS may coordinate muscle activations through a linear combination of <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies.</b> Neurological diseases influence motor recruitment and, consequently, modify <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies.</b> Our purpose was to understand the modifications induced by Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) in post stroke patients during upper limb rehabilitation. To this aim we compared <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> pre and post intervention. METHODS: Five chronic stroke participants undertook nine tracking tasks in a planar robot in which trajectory (orientation and length), duration, speed and resistance were varied. Error in target tracking was corrected by electrical stimulation of the triceps muscle. Timing and level of stimulation was adjusted using iterative learning control algorithms. EMG signals were collected at 1500 Hz from 7 upper arm and shoulder muscles (Biceps BIC; Anterior Deltoid DEL_A; Pectoralis major PEC_M; Trapezius, upper TRAP_UPP, medial TRAP_MED, lower TRAP_LOW; Triceps TRI), both before and after 18 treatment sessions. The same EMG data was collected under the same conditions with 8 neurologically intact participants on a single occasion. Raw data were rectified, low-pass-filtered (Butterworth, 4 th ord., 20 Hz) and normalized to their maximal values. <b>Muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> were extracted using the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization algorithm. Differences in weight coefficients and timing patterns between the groups have been respectively evaluated by means of their scalar product and their correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Preliminary results showed statistically significant differences between <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> extracted from impaired and healthy subjects. However, despite of improved motor performance following the intervention, there were no statistically significant changes in <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies.</b> CONCLUSION: The present study shows that <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> in chronic stroke patients differ from normal but are not modified by this intervention. Concomitant improvement in motor performance in the absence of significant normalisation of <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> implies reinforcement of residual motor strategies acquired after stroke.

A {{significant number of}} falls may be prevented via appropriate slip-responses since a strong relation exists between slips and falls. More importantly, as severe slips {{are more prone to}} result in a fall, identifying severe slippers along with the responsible factors for their adverse motor control and severe slipping should be the highest priority in fall prevention process. Previous studies have suggested that <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> may be building blocks of the central nervous system in controlling motor tasks. <b>Muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> observed during slipping (‘post-slip-initiation synergies’ or ‘just briefly,’ ‘slipping muscle synergies’), may represent the fundamental blocks of the neural control during slipping. Hence, studying the differences in slipping <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> of mild and severe slippers can potentially reveal the differences in their neural control and subsequently, indicate the responsible factors for the adverse post-slip response in severe slippers. Even though the slipping <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> have been investigated before, it still remains unclear on how the slip severity is associated with the slipping <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies.</b> More importantly, <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> can be interpreted not only as neural blocks but also as physical sub-tasks of the main motor task. Hence, studying the differences of slipping synergies of mild and severe slippers would reveal the discrepancies in sub-tasks of their post-slip response. These discrepancies help pinpoint the malfunctioning sub-function associated with inadequate motor response seen in severe slippers. Twenty healthy subjects were recruited and underwent an unexpected slip (to extract their slipping synergies). Subjects were classified into mild and severe slippers based on their Peak Heel Speed. An independent t-test revealed several significant inter-group differences for <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> of mild and severe slippers indicating differences in their neural control of slipping. A forward dynamic simulation was utilized to reveal the functionality of each synergy. Decomposition of slipping into sub-tasks (synergies), and finding the malfunctioning sub-task in severe slippers is important as it results in a novel targeted motor-rehabilitation technique that only aims to re-establish the impaired sub-task responsible for the adverse motor-response in severe slippers...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{indicate}} that motor coordination may be achieved by assembling task-dependent combinations of a few <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies,</b> defined here as fixed patterns of activation across a set of muscles. Our recent study of severely impaired chronic stroke survivors showed that some <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> underlying isometric force generation at the hand are altered in the affected arm. However, whether similar alterations are evident in stroke survivors with lesser impairment remains unclear. Accordingly, we examined <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> underlying spatial patterns of elbow and shoulder muscle activation recorded during an isometric force target matching protocol performed by 16 chronic stroke survivors, evenly divided across mild and moderate impairment levels. We applied non-negative matrix factorization to identify the <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> and compared their structure across groups, including previously collected data from 6 age-matched control subjects and 8 severely impaired stroke survivors. For all groups, EMG spatial patterns were well explained by task-dependent combinations {{of only a few}} (typically 4) <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies.</b> Broadly speaking, elbow-related synergies were conserved across stroke survivors, regardless of impairment level. In contrast, the shoulder-related synergies of some stroke survivors with mild and moderate impairment differed from controls, {{in a manner similar to}} severely impaired subjects. Cluster analysis of pooled synergies for the 30 subjects identified 7 distinct clusters (synergies). Subsequent analysis confirmed that the incidences of 3 elbow-related synergies were independent of impairment level, while the incidences of 4 shoulder-related synergies were systematically correlated with impairment level.

Evidence for this structure comes from electromyographical (EMG) data in frogs, cats, and humans, where various mathematical methods such as principal components analysis and non-negative matrix factorization are used to [...] "extract" [...] synergies from muscle activation patterns. Similarities have been observed in synergy structure even across different tasks such as kicking, jumping, swimming and walking in frogs. Further evidence comes from stroke patients, who have been observed to use fewer synergies in certain tasks; some stroke patients used a comparable number of synergies as healthy subjects, but with reduced motor performance.

5000|$|In {{order to}} reduce the number of {{musculoskeletal}} DOFs upon which the nervous system must operate, it has been proposed that the nervous system controls muscle synergies, or groups of co-activated muscles, rather than individual muscles.

[...] Multiple muscles are contained within each synergy at fixed ratios of co-activation, and multiple synergies can contain the same muscle. It has been proposed that muscle synergies emerge from an interaction between constraints and properties of the nervous and musculoskeletal systems. This organization may require less computational effort for the nervous system than individual muscle control because fewer synergies are needed to explain a behavior than individual muscles. Furthermore, it has been proposed that synergies themselves may change as behaviors are learned and/or optimized. However, synergies may also be innate to some degree, as suggested by postural responses of humans at very young ages.|$|E

40|$|Human {{locomotion}} is {{a complex}} motor task. Previous research hypothesized that <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> reflect the modular control of muscle groups operated by the Central Nervous System (CNS). Despite the high stride-to-stride variability characterizing human gait, most studies analyze only a few strides. This may be limiting, because the intra-subject variability of motor output is neglected. This gap could be filled by recording and analyzing many gait cycles during a single walking task. In this way, it can be investigated if CNS recruits the same <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> consistently or if different strategies are adopted during the locomotion task. The aim of this work is to investigate the intra-subject consistency of <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> during overground walking. Twelve young healthy volunteers were instructed to walk for 5 min at their natural pace. On the average, 181 ± 10 gait cycles were analyzed for each subject. Surface electromyography was recorded from 12 muscles of the dominant lower limb and the trunk. Gait cycles were grouped into subgroups containing 10 gait cycles each. The consistency of the <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> extracted during the gait trial was assessed by measuring cosine similarity (CS) of muscle weights vectors, and zero-lag cross-correlation (CC) of activation signals. The average intra-subject CS and CC were 0. 94 ± 0. 10 and 0. 96 ± 0. 06, respectively. We found five synergies shared by all the subjects: high consistency values were found for these synergies (CS = 0. 96 ± 0. 05, CC = 0. 97 ± 0. 03). In addition, we found 10 subject-specific synergies. These synergies were less consistent (CS = 0. 80 ± 0. 20, CC = 0. 89 ± 0. 14).

A functional <b>muscle</b> <b>synergy</b> {{is defined as a}} pattern of co-activation of muscles recruited by a single neural command signal. [...] One muscle can be part of multiple muscle synergies, and one synergy can activate multiple muscles. The current method of finding muscle synergies is to measure EMG (electromyography) signals from the muscles involved in a certain movement so that specific patterns of muscle activation can be identified. Statistical analyses are applied to the filtered EMG data to determine the number of muscle synergies that best represent the original EMG. Alternatively, coherence analysis of EMG data can be used to determine the coupling between muscles and the frequency of common input. A reduced number of control elements (muscle synergies) are combined to form a continuum of muscle activation for smooth motor control during various tasks. These synergies work together to produce movements such as walking or balance control. Directionality of a movement has an effect on how the motor task is performed (i.e. walking forward vs. walking backward, each uses different levels of contraction in different muscles). Researchers have measured EMG signals for perturbation applied in multiple directions in order to identify muscle synergies that are present for all directions.|$|E

We defined the activation of a single <b>muscle</b> <b>synergy</b> as the generation of a muscle activity pattern vector parallel to the single <b>muscle</b> <b>synergy</b> vector. Subjects performed an isometric force production task with their right hand, and the 13 muscle activity patterns associated with their elbow and shoulder movements were measured.

The number (N) of muscle synergies was determined by using the variability accounted for (VAF, NVAF) and the coefficient of determination (CD, NCD). An additional <b>muscle</b> <b>synergy</b> model with NAD was also considered.

The basic patterns and distribution weights indicate temporal and spatial structures, respectively, and the weights show the muscle sets that are activated synchronously. In addition, various locomotor behaviors have similar low dimensional structures and major differences appear in the basic patterns. These analysis results suggest that neural systems use muscle group combinations to solve motor control redundancy problems (<b>muscle</b> <b>synergy</b> hypothesis) and manipulate those basic patterns to create various locomotor functions. However, it remains unclear how the neural system controls such muscle groups and basic patterns through neuromechanical interactions in order to achieve adaptive locomotor behavior. This paper reviews simulation studies that explored adaptive motor control in locomotion via sensory-motor coordination using neuromusculoskeletal models based on the <b>muscle</b> <b>synergy</b> hypothesis. Herein, the neural mechanism in motor control related to the <b>muscle</b> <b>synergy</b> for adaptive locomotion and a potential <b>muscle</b> <b>synergy</b> analysis method including neuromusculoskeletal modeling for motor impairments and rehabilitation are discussed...|$|E

Recently, the characteristics of <b>muscle</b> <b>synergy</b> were quantitatively evaluated using nonnegative matrix factorization (NNMF) with surface electromyography. Previous studies have identified that the number and structure of synergies were associated with motor function in patients after stroke. However, most of these studies had a cross-sectional design, and the changes in <b>muscle</b> <b>synergy</b> during recovery process are not clear. In present study, two consecutive measurements were conducted for subacute patients after stroke and the change of number and structure of muscle synergies during gait were determined using NNMF. Results showed that functional change did not rely on number of synergies in patients after subacute stroke. However, the extent of merging of the synergies was negatively associated with an increase in muscle strength and the range of angle at ankle joint. Our results suggest that the neural changes represented by NNMF were related to the longitudinal change of function and gait pattern and that the merging of synergy is an important marker in patients after subacute stroke...|$|E
40|$|To {{handle the}} rich {{repertoire}} of behavioural goals, the CNS has {{to control the}} many degrees of freedom of the musculoskeletal system in a flexible manner. This problem can be drastically simplified if <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> serve as the to-be-controlled building blocks of motor performance, instead of the individual degrees of freedom. <b>Muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> {{have been identified as}} coherent activation patterns of a group of muscles in space or time, but the neural mechanisms underlying their formation remain largely unknown. Here we evaluated the hypothesis that synergies are reflected in common input to different contributing muscles, and investigated modulations in motor unit (MU) synchronization of homologous muscles during a rhythmic balance task. If common input is related to <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies,</b> the resultant MU synchronization should not be static but task dependent and, in the present context, vary in time. Coherence between surface electromyographic signals of bilateral leg muscles revealed MU synchronization in two distinct frequency bands. MU synchronization was not constant but modulated within a movement cycle, and its time course resembled the activation patterns of the muscles. These results are congruent with a linkage between MU synchronization and <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies,</b> and suggest that MU synchronization provides an expedient method for studying synergy-related neural mechanisms. © The Authors (2009) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of upper limb motor function impairments and associated participation restrictions still represent a challenging therapy target in stroke neurorehabilitation. Recent {{evidence showed that}} virtual reality (VR) is better than conventional physiotherapy for the {{treatment of}} upper limb, after stroke. Both genetics and neurophysiological factors drive functional recovery and carrying the Val 66 Met single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was argued to be a potential determinant of poor motor recovery. Motor control theories postulate that the motor system pools groups of muscles in functional units called <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies,</b> to control voluntary movements. A determined number of <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies,</b> which is stable across subjects, but affected by stroke, allows the description of natural motor behaviour. Evidence from animals proposed a subcortical and spinal substrate for <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies.</b> In this thesis, a virtual reality environment commonly applied in real clinical settings {{for the treatment of}} upper limb after stroke, was used as a reference framework to test hypotheses on both the genetics and neurophysiological factors described above. The first part of the thesis explores whether carrying the Val 66 Met SNP BDNF determines a bad recovery of upper limb motor function and whether different brain morphologies are associated with each genotype, in stroke survivors. The second part of the thesis explores whether <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> are represented in the human brain and whether their representation is affected by stroke. The third part of the thesis explores whether <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> might represent a robust neurophysiological outcome to test differences in efficacy between VR-based treatments and conventional therapy. With regard to genetics, the key findings were that polymorphisms of the BDNF do not determine clinically detectable differences, but brain morphological differences exist, because of the genotypes, with bigger brain areas in carriers of the Val 66 Met SNP BDNF. Neurophysiological findings showed that <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> are represented in the brain structures of the pyramidal motor system, but their representation extends to brain areas devoted to higher order cognitive functions, after stroke. Finally, it was found that VR-based therapy determines a better functional brain reorganisation around <b>muscle</b> <b>synergies</b> brain seeds, than conventional physiotherapy. More {{research is needed to determine}} whether these findings represent reliable modules which can be incorporated within a computational model of neurorehabilitation...|$|R
