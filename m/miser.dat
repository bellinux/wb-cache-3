5|$|Matters were {{complicated}} by mass illnesses spreading across London; the epidemic, probably flu, {{reduced the number}} of actors able to work and many plays were cancelled. Even Henry Fielding's play The <b>Miser,</b> which was to open early January, was postponed because of the poor health of its cast members, including Theophilus. The <b>Miser</b> was eventually staged in mid February and was successful, but another of his plays, Deborah: or, a Wife for You All, lasted only one night on 6 April 1733. Regardless of the problems plaguing the season, it was positive for Fielding while it lasted, with six of his plays being produced on stage along with Thomas Arne's The Opera of Operas, Fielding's Tom Thumb set to music.|$|E
5|$|A Christmas Carol in Prose, Being a Ghost-Story of Christmas, {{commonly}} known as A Christmas Carol, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in London by Chapman & Hall in 1843; the first edition was illustrated by John Leech.

50|$|The early 19th century saw <b>misers</b> {{become the}} subject of the musicals then fashionable in France. Eugène Scribe and Germain Delavigne collaborated onL'avare en goguette (The <b>miser's</b> spree) in 1823, while Jean-François Bayard and Paul Duport collaborated on the two-act La fille de l'avare (The <b>Miser's</b> Daughter) in 1835. The latter playwas freely adapted in 1835 by John G. Millingen under the title of The <b>Miser’s</b> Daughter. Two further adaptations of the French play were to follow later: Love and Avarice (1859) by J. V. Bridgeman (1819-89), and John Palgrave Simpson's Daddy Hardacre in 1857. Meanwhile, William Harrison Ainsworth's period novel The <b>Miser's</b> Daughter (first serialised in 1842) was {{spawning}} a fresh crop of dramas of that title. Two were played in 1842 and a further adaptation called Hilda in 1872. A similarly titled play was the five-act comedy partially in verse, The <b>Miser's</b> Daughter or The Lover's Curse of 1839, a schoolboy indiscretion of the future controversial churchman, Rev.John Purchas. And {{on the other side of}} the Atlantic there was a stage production of Julietta Gordini:The <b>Miser's</b> Daughter, a verse play in five acts, which claimed to derive its plot 'from an Italian story'.|$|R

5|$|The {{story begins}} {{on a cold}} and bleak Christmas Eve in London, seven years {{after the death of}} Ebenezer Scrooge's {{business}} partner, Jacob Marley. Scrooge, an old <b>miser,</b> hates Christmas and refuses an invitation to Christmas dinner from his nephew Fred. He turns away two men who seek a donation from him in order to provide food and heating for the poor, and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.|$|E
5|$|In 1852, John Camden Neild, an {{eccentric}} <b>miser,</b> left Victoria an unexpected legacy, which Albert {{used to obtain}} the freehold of Balmoral. As usual, he embarked on an extensive programme of improvements. The same year, he was appointed to several of the offices left vacant {{by the death of}} the Duke of Wellington, including the mastership of Trinity House and the colonelcy of the Grenadier Guards. With Wellington's passing, Albert was able to propose and campaign for modernisation of the army, which was long overdue. Thinking that the military was unready for war, and that Christian rule was preferable to Islamic rule, Albert counselled a diplomatic solution to conflict between the Russian and Ottoman empires. Palmerston was more bellicose, and favoured a policy that would prevent further Russian expansion. Palmerston was manoeuvred out of the cabinet in December 1853, but {{at about the same time}} a Russian fleet attacked the Ottoman fleet at anchor at Sinop. The London press depicted the attack as a criminal massacre, and Palmerston's popularity surged as Albert's fell. Within two weeks, Palmerston was re-appointed as a minister. As public outrage at the Russian action continued, false rumours circulated that Albert had been arrested for treason and was being held prisoner in the Tower of London.|$|E
