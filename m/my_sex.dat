Lugosi is also depicted as dying alone and miserable. Lugosi's wife of twenty years, Lillian, did leave him in 1953, but he remarried in 1955 to Hope Lininger. They were together until his death a year later. This, plus any reference to Lugosi's teenage son, Bela G. Lugosi, were omitted, as is any mention of Lugosi's role in the 1956 United Artists film The Black Sleep.

25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of <b>my</b> <b>sex,</b> will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

500|$|The album's Roman numeral title {{referred}} {{to each of}} the band members having turned 20 years old by the time xx was released. Because of their age, many critics interpreted the songs as nocturnal depictions of adolescent lust. Philip Sherburne wrote in Spin that xx brimmed with a [...] "young lust" [...] often found in rock music, and recordings such as [...] "Fantasy" [...] and [...] "Shelter" [...] expressed a jaded yearning, particularly in a lyric from the latter song: [...] "Can I make it better with the lights turned on". Croft vehemently denied this: [...] "We were writing these songs when we were 17. I can honestly say I've never thought this is about <b>my</b> <b>sex</b> life." [...] Croft and Sim, who were both gay, did not intend for the songs to be heard as romantic duets; she said they were singing [...] "past each other" [...] rather than to each other. Having combined their individually written lyrics, they could not definitely explain what their songs were about, although Croft said Sim's lyrics resonated with her nonetheless and enjoyed the personal interpretation it offered. [...] "You can put them into your own life", she explained, [...] "like, 'Oh, this is my song. The romantic situations Sim wrote of had been inspired by other people.

I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E

She would have my bags packed and sitting outside the door when I got home at night and things like that. Plus I would go through massive guilt whenever I did go out with a guy and I was with her.
