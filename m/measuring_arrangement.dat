40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} summary of our computer-numeric {{investigations}} on calorimetric air-flow sensors considering two alternative <b>measuring</b> <b>arrangements.</b> For the sensor flush mounted {{to the wall of}} a rectangular duct, static flow transduction characteristics for both, the controlledovertemperature and the constant-power operation mode, were derived from finite element based simulations. The simulation results are in good agreement with previous measurements. Additionally, we simulated the flushmounted sensor response to step-like changes of the air-flow. Based on the model, one can understand the very specific features of the transient sensor signal. Guided by this knowledge, improved design rules for calorimetric flow sensors may be developed. In contrast, immersing a bare sensor chip into the fluid stream, which was the alternative approach studied, leads to improper transduction characteristics due to the formation of flow-vortices.

40|$|The {{intensity}} {{and frequency of}} defoliation of ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) by beef heifers exclusively grazing or receiving corn grain or extruded commercial product with fat as supplement were evaluated. The grazing method was put-and-take stocking. The experimental design was completely randomized following a repeated <b>measure</b> <b>arrangement,</b> three treatments and two area replications. The phyllochron of ryegrass was 140. 1 and 303. 4 °GD the leaf lifespan. The intensity (67. 0 %) {{and the frequency of}} defoliation (6. 4 days) were similar, regardless of supply or no of energetic supplement for grazing heifers. The defoliation frequency indicates that the heifers can return about 3. 3 times to the same tiller during the leaf lifespan.

The experiment {{was carried out}} in a randomized complete design following a repeated <b>measure</b> <b>arrangement</b> (three experimental periods) with three replications of two leaf blade masses (600 and 1, 000 kg/ha DM), which were maintained using continuous grazing with variable stocking rate. The variables measured were sward height, herbage mass, leaf blade and stem bulk density in sward vertical strata (sward structural characteristics), grazing, idling, rumination time and bite rate of heifers (ingestive behaviour).

The daily grazing, rumination and idling time of beef heifers were similar for both leaf blade masses. Structural variation of the sward, during the experimental period, altered the grazing, rumination and idling time of heifers, and affected the bite rate.
