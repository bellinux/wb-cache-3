40|$|The Section 8 Existing Housing Program, {{currently}} the largest housing program administered by HUD, provides subsidies to low-income families living in privately-owned rental units {{of their own}} choosing. Under current rules and budgets, funds have not been sufficient to serve all eligible families {{willing to participate in}} the program, and public housing agencies have not limited assistance to the poorest eligible families. Instead, they serve many families above the poverty line while denying assistance to the majority of those below it. A simple proposal for targeting more assistance to the poorest families and eliminating the horizontal inequity resulting from offering assistance to some, but not all, families with the same characteristics is to decrease the subsidy at each income level by the same amount. One objection to this proposal is that the poorest eligible families {{would not be able to}} find units meeting the program’s space and quality standards if subsidies were lower. This paper finds that the program’s subsidy to the poorest eligible families greatly exceeds the <b>minimum</b> <b>rent</b> of units meeting the program’s standards. It also shows that the most common objections to reducing subsidy levels under the program are inconsistent with existing evidence. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{emphasizes}} {{initially the}} effects of moving transaction costs on the potential effect of government rent subsidy programs. As a concomitant to this analysis, the paper reaffirms the low income elasticities of housing expenditure among low-income renters found by others. Moving transaction costs are high on average among renters in our sample but vary widely between geographic regions and evidently vary a great deal among families as well. By our measure, transaction costs reflect monetary and especially non-monetary gains and losses associated with moving. Moving transaction costs in conjunction with low income elasticities make government lump-sum transfers very ineffective in increasing housing expenditure among low-incomerenters. A dollar of unconstrained transfer payment would increase housing expenditure by only 2 to 7 cents in the two cities in our data set. <b>Minimum</b> <b>rent</b> plans, that make the transfer payment conditional on spending at leasta minimum amount on rent, have larger effects on average than unconstrained transfers. Typical programs might increase rent by 10 to 30 cents per dollar of transfer payment. But families who spend the least on rent a real so those least likely {{to benefit from the}} <b>minimum</b> <b>rent</b> programs. To obtain payments under these plans, families who would otherwise spend less than the minimum must surmount the transaction costs associated with moving and must also reallocate income to favor housing in proportions that may be far from their preferred allocations. Thus only a small proportion of families with initial market rents below the minimum will ultimately participate in the programs. And of the total payments to these families, 15 to 32 percent is dead weight loss, according to our estimates. In addition, we find that because moving transaction costs and income elasticities vary widely among regions, {{the effects of}} any given government program are also likely to vary greatly from one region to the other. As a fortuitous benefit of the housing allowance demand experiment data that we used, we were also able to check our model results against experimental results. The model predictions and the experimental results correspond quite closely. The differences that are found can apparently be explained in large part by the impact of self-selection on the estimated experimental treatment effects. The self-determination of enrollment and the attrition inherent in the estimated experimental effects seriously detract from the potential benefits of experimental randomization. Therefore our model estimates may be more reliable than the experimental ones in this instance. Of course this judgment depends in large part on the experiment having been done so that we could check our model predictions against the experimental outcomes. ...|$|E

40|$|We exploit {{a natural}} {{experiment}} {{provided by the}} 1990 introduction of the UK National Minimum Wage (NMW) to investigate the relationship between wages and monitoring and to test for Efficiency Wages considerations in a low-wage sector, the UK residential care homes industry.

Estimation results suggest that higher wage costs were more than offset by lower monitoring costs, and thus the overall evidence imply that the NMW may have operated as an Efficiency Wage. These findings support Efficiency Wage models used to explain a non-negative employment effect of the Minimum Wage and provide an explanation of recent evidence from the care homes sector that although the wage structure was heavily affected by the NMW introduction, there were moderate employment effects.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of circuit designs has necessitated a top-down approach to layout synthesis. A {{large body of}} work shows that a good layout hierarchy, or partitioning tree, {{as measured by the}} associated Rent parameter, will correspond to an area-efficient layout. We define the intrinsic Rent parameter of a netlist to be the <b>minimum</b> possible <b>Rent</b> parameter of any partitioning tree for the netlist. Experimental results show that spectra-based ratio cut partitioning algorithms yield partitioning trees with the lowest observed Rent parameter over all benchmarks and over all algorithms tested. For examples where the intrinsic Rent parameter is known, spectral ratio cut partitioning yields a partitioning tree with Rent parameter essentially identical to this theoretical optimum. These results have deep implications withrespect to both the choice of partitioning algorithms for top-down layout, as well as new approaches to layout area estimation. The paper concludes with directions for future research, including several promising techniques for fast estimation of the (intrinsic) Rent parameter...|$|R

The reason is that [...] like the <b>minimum</b> wage [...] <b>rent</b> control has served as a case study in price regulation.
