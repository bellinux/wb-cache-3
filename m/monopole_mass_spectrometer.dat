SELMI, Sumy, Ukraine, 1 to 210 mass range) with electron impact ionization, converted for thermal desorption measurements. Sample (0.1 to 20 mg) was placed {{at the bottom of}} a quartz-molybdenum vessel and pressure was reduced to 5 ⋅ 10 - 5 Pa. Samples were heated to 750 °С at 0.15 °С s- 1. Volatile products entered the mass spectrometer ionization chamber where they were ionized and fragmented with electron beam. Desorption rate temperature dependence helps identifying thermal transformation products and provides interaction energy between the copper chloride active phase and γ-Al 2 O 3 carrier[8].|$|E
40|$|The {{reactions}} of NO and NO 2 with H 2 O 2 {{have been examined}} at 25 C. Reaction mixtures were monitored by continuously bleeding through a pinhole into a <b>monopole</b> <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> NO 2 was also monitored by its optical absorption in the visible part of the spectrum. Reaction mixtures containing initially 1. 5 - 2. 5 torr of NO 2 and 0. 8 - 1. 4 torr of H 2 O 2 or 1 - 12 torr of NO and 0. 5 - 1. 5 torr of H 2 O 2 were studied. The H 2 O 2 - NO reaction was complex. There was an induction period followed by a marked acceleration in reactant removal. The final products of the reaction, NO 2, probably H 2 O, and possibly HONO 2 were produced mainly after all the H 2 O 2 was removed. The HONO intermediate was shown to disproportionate to NO 2 + NO + H 2 O in a relatively slow first order reaction. The acceleration in H 2 O 2 removal after the NO - H 2 O 2 reaction is started is caused by NO 2 catalysis...|$|E
3000|$|TPD-MS {{experiments}} were {{performed in a}} MKh- 7304 A <b>monopole</b> <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer</b> (Electron, Sumy, Ukraine) with electron impact ionization, adapted for thermodesorption measurements. A typical test comprised placing a 20 -mg sample {{on the bottom of}} a molybdenum-quartz ampoule, evacuating to approximately 5 [*]×[*] 10 − 5  Pa at approximately 20 °C and then heating at 0.15 °C/s from room temperature to approximately 750 °C. For all the samples, the sample vials were filled approximately 1 / 16 full, which helped limit interparticle diffusion effects [24 – 28]. Limiting the sample volume along with the high vacuum should further limit readsorption and diffusion resistance as described elsewhere [24 – 33]. The volatile pyrolysis products was passed through a high-vacuum valve (5.4  mm in diameter, a length of 20  cm and a volume of 12  mL) into the ionization chamber of the mass spectrometer where they were ionized and fragmented by electron impact. After mass separation in the mass analyzer, the ion current due to desorption and pyrolysis was amplified with a VEU- 6 secondary-electron multiplier ("Gran" [...] Federal State Unitary Enterprise, Vladikavkaz, Russia). The mass spectra and the P-T curves (where P is the pressure of volatile pyrolysis products, and T is the temperature of the samples) were recorded and analyzed using a computer-based data acquisition and processing setup. The mass spectra were recorded within 1 to 210  amu. During each TPD-MS experiment, approximately 240 mass spectra were recorded and averaged. During the thermodesorption experiment, the samples were heated slowly while keeping a high rate of evacuation of the volatile pyrolysis products. The diffusion effects can thus be neglected, and the intensity of the ion current can be considered proportional to the desorption rate.|$|E
