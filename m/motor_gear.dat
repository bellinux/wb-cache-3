50|$|The {{drum motor}} needs fewer parts and has low {{inventory}} costs as it just {{consists of the}} drum motor and two fixing brackets. Unlike conventional drives that require up to 8 or more separate components, most of which have to be purchased from different suppliers or manufactures specially.Further advantage is its dimension. The drum motor is often lighter than conventional drives and the weight is evenly distributed within the conveyor frame.The <b>motor,</b> <b>gear</b> box and bearings are totally enclosed and sealed in a shell, therefore {{they are unlikely to}} fail due to harmful environmental conditions such as water, dust, dirt, grit, chemicals, grease, oil, and so on.|$|E
50|$|The {{propulsion}} systems were significant upgrades featuring camshaft driven motor controllers that offered both higher and smoother acceleration. The air compressors and <b>motor</b> <b>gear</b> train were far quieter; {{that along with}} the sealed windows and fluorescent lighting provided an isolated and relaxing environment for the passengers. Seating consisted of reversible 3-2 bench seats with a synthetic canvas covering with a total capacity of 130 persons per car, {{far more than the}} cars they replaced. The cars were built with manually operated doors that contained convertible traps for low level operation. After the electrified lines were converted to all high level operation {{with the arrival of the}} M1A cars, the ACMUs were left in their high level configuration full-time. The manual side doors were never automated resulting in the frequent practice of doors being left open over the entire duration of a trip.|$|E
50|$|In a {{standard}} 4WD design, the separate four wheels {{are allowed to}} rotate at different speeds {{through the use of}} differentials. This is important for cornering to eliminate binding. In a Mini 4WD, this is not {{a standard}} design and is only achieved through optional one-way wheel sets. Thus, the standard Mini 4WD utilizes a direct drive to all 4 wheels even around corners. Chassis' are designed to hold the motor and batteries in differing arrangements. There are sideways motors positioned in the rear. There are sideways motors positions in the front. There are in-line motors positioned in the middle. Rear and Front position motor designs position batteries {{side by side in the}} front or rear of the motor placement. Middle position motor designs position the batteries straddling either side of the motor. Rear and front position motor designs utilize a propeller rod extending from the main <b>motor</b> <b>gear</b> box that drives both the front and rear axles. Middle position motor design powers both the front and back wheels through separate gear boxes eliminating the need for such a propeller rod.|$|E

50|$|This {{arrangement}} {{is common for}} slow speed diesel shunters, but not usually for main line speeds. The Swedish D-lok of 1925 did use it, with two <b>motors</b> <b>geared</b> to a single jackshaft with short rods between two driving axles of a 1-C-1 layout.|$|R
5000|$|Inspecting a graph of {{traction}} <b>motor</b> <b>gear</b> efficiency [...] shows 98% efficiency at {{nominal power}} but only 94% efficiency at 30% of nominal power. To get {{the efficiency of}} the motor and gears (connected in series), the two efficiencies must be multiplied. If the weighted traction motor efficiency is 90%, then 90% x 94% = 85% (very rough estimate) which is not too much lower than that estimated the 90% supporters mentioned above. If per the table 75% of power to the substation reaches the locomotive motors then 75% x 85 = 64% (roughly) of the power to the substation (from the USSR's power grid) reaches the wheels of the locomotives in the form of mechanical energy to pull the trains. This neglects the power used for [...] "housekeeping" [...] (heating, lighting, etc.) on passenger trains. This is over the whole range of operating conditions in the early 1970s. There are a number of ways to significantly improve this 64% figure and it fails to take into account savings due to regeneration (using the traction motors as generators to put power back on the catenary to power other trains).|$|E

It was {{an important}} scientific and technological objective of China's Eighth Five-Year Plan, and was designed for 160 km/h runs on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway. The Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway line will open with an operating speed of 160 km/h, utilizing high-speed passenger trains {{and the level of}} potential development of a new type of high speed passenger diesel locomotive. By the end of 1990 development was begun by the Qishuyan Locomotive Works, who modified a DF9 locomotive, changing traction <b>motor</b> <b>gear</b> transmission ratio, thereby increasing the maximum speed from 140 km/h up to 160 km/h. The new locomotive was then tested to obtain the experimental data for high-speed diesel service. In 1991, the Ministry of Railways ordered the new locomotive based on the design plans developed by the Qishuyan plant. Code-named the DF11, the first DF11 number 0001 was completed in December 1992, with the test trials completed in August 1993. The next locomotive, No. 0002, reached the maximum speed of 183 km/h during a test in the National Railway Test Centre (Eastern Suburbs Branch [...] ) in April 1994. After the completion of the trials, the DF11 was formally placed into service on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen High Speed Railway Line in December.

In most cases, these tests are adequate to address the performance characteristics under environmental and loading effects with some uncertainties and decent power/torque margins.
