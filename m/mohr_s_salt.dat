Glyceryl trinitrate and sodium nitroprusside, which generate NO following tissue bioactivation, have profiles resembling the profile of endothelium-derived NO more than that of exogenous NO.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine and compare the {{similarities}} and differences between active components of <b>S.</b> miltiorrhiza depside <b>salt</b> and aspirin using perspective of pharmacological molecular networks. Active components of <b>S.</b> miltiorrhiza depside <b>salt</b> and aspirin’s related genes were identified via the STITCH 4. 0 and GeneCards Database. A text search engine (Agilent Literature Search 2. 71) and MCODE software were applied to construct network and divide modules, respectively. Finally, 32, 2, and 28 overlapping genes, modules, and pathways were identified between active components of <b>S.</b> miltiorrhiza depside <b>salt</b> and aspirin. A multidimensional framework of drug network showed that two networks reflected commonly in human aortic endothelial cells and atherosclerosis process.
