5|$|Complex taboos and rites are {{associated}} with a woman's first childbirth. When about to give birth she is secluded in a special birthing house called a komby. The leaves she eats from and the waste produced by the newborn are kept in a special receptacle for seven days, at which point they are burned. The ash produced is rubbed on the forehead and cheeks of the mother and baby and must be worn for seven days. On the fifteenth day both are bathed in water in which lime or lemon leaves have been soaked. This ritual is called ranom-boahangy (bath of the leaves). The community gathers to drink rum and celebrate with wrestling matches, but the <b>mother</b> <b>must</b> stay in the komby. She is not allowed to consume anything other than saonjo greens and a chicken specially prepared for her. After this celebration she is required to leave the komby and can return to routine life.|$|E
25|$|Breastfeeding {{represents}} an opportunity cost, as the <b>mother</b> <b>must</b> spend {{hours each day}} breastfeeding instead of other activities, such as paid work or home production (such as growing food). In general, the higher the mother's earning power, the less likely she is to save money by breastfeeding.|$|E

Dr. Andrea O’Reilly of York University in Toronto said at a 2011 Women’s Worlds conference in Ottawa, Canada that feminist <b>mothering</b> <b>must</b> focus on things that are denied to women by patriarchal motherhood. Feminist <b>mothers</b> <b>must</b> take control of their lives and act according to their own beliefs rather than society's expectations.|$|R

25|$|Safe {{technique}} should {{ensure that}} obstructive apnoea cannot occur. Since the <b>mother</b> <b>must</b> {{be able to}} sleep to provide adequate dose, this requires keeping the airway safely open, and close containment to mother’s bare chest using a garment, various of these are described in the WHO guidelines.|$|E

50|$|Levels 1, 2 and 4 {{consist of}} {{different}} platforms that the <b>mother</b> kangaroo <b>must</b> jump onto or climb onto via a ladder. On the third level, the cage {{in which the}} kid kangaroo is imprisoned is held up by an entire troop of monkeys {{and there is a}} horde of apples that the monkey will unleash if five of them climb up there. On this level, the <b>mother</b> kangaroo <b>must</b> punch each monkey in the stack several times until the cage is lowered and when the cage has been lowered enough, the <b>mother</b> kangaroo <b>must</b> climb to the next floor to get to the kid kangaroo before the cage is raised again or before the monkeys have an avalanche of apple cores unleashed.|$|R

40|$|An {{emerging}} {{strand of}} thought portrays pregnant women with drug addiction and HIV infection {{as having a}} willful hostility towards their fetus. As a result, pregnant mothers with HIV or addictions are confronted with decreased funding for services and increased sanctions for positive toxicology tests. The rhetoric of blame towards “deviant” mothers has escalated to embrace poor mothers in general. However, {{in order to support}} the babies, their <b>mothers</b> <b>must</b> be supported as well...|$|R

In {{the thirteenth century}} Blood Bowl Sutra, for instance, Mulian's <b>mother</b> <b>must</b> swim in a bloody pool and drink blood to punish her for letting her menstrual blood flow into public waters which the Buddha drank it when his followers used it {{to make him a}} cup of tea.|$|E
25|$|While a firstborn to both parents, or a firstborn to {{only the}} <b>mother,</b> <b>must</b> fast {{according}} to all authorities, there is a dispute among the early halakhic authorities regarding {{the status of a}} firstborn to only the father. The Shulchan Aruch (OC 470:1) codifies that a firstborn to only the father is obligated to fast, while most printings of the Arba'ah Turim (ibid.) indicate that such a person would be exempt. Common practice follows the Shulchan Aruch.|$|E
25|$|Three {{ordinances}} {{have been}} preserved which were promulgated by R. Jose b. Ḥalafta of Sepphoris, {{of the third}} generation of tannaim, who flourished about {{the middle of the}} 2nd century. They are as follows: (1) during a funeral the mourners must remain standing while those who console them pass by (Sanh. 19a); (2) women living in lonely places must associate with one another, so as not to attract the attention and evil desire of any man (ib.); (3) a child accompanied by its <b>mother</b> <b>must</b> not lag behind on the road, lest it come to harm (ib.).|$|E

25|$|As a medication, {{it is used}} {{to treat}} a number of {{conditions}} including anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, and superficial bleeding. Inhaled epinephrine may be used to improve the symptoms of croup. It may also be used for asthma when other treatments are not effective. It is given intravenously, by injection into a muscle, by inhalation, or by injection just under the skin. Common side effects include shakiness, anxiety, and sweating. A fast heart rate and high blood pressure may occur. Occasionally it may result in an abnormal heart rhythm. While the safety of its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unclear, the benefits to the <b>mother</b> <b>must</b> be taken into account.|$|E
25|$|The {{adopted child}} {{can be either}} male or female. The adopted child must fall under the Hindu category. The adoptee {{also needs to be}} unmarried; however, if the {{particular}} custom or usage is applicable to the involved parties then the adoptee can be married. The child cannot be the age of sixteen or older, unless again it is custom or the usage is applicable to the involved parties. An adoption can only occur if there is not a child of the same sex of the adopted child still residing in the home. In particular, if a son were to be adopted then the adoptive father or <b>mother</b> <b>must</b> not have a legitimate or adopted son still living in the house.|$|E
25|$|A {{priest of}} Aaron's lineage (i.e. Kohen) is {{forbidden}} by the Mosaic Law (Torah) {{to marry a}} divorced woman even {{if she were a}} native Israelite. Likewise, a male descendant from Aaron's line is prohibited to marry a Jewish woman who has had intercourse with a non-Jew, whether she had been raped or she had willfully done so. So, too, he cannot marry a Jewish woman whose birth was by a father who is a Kohen but who violated one of these prohibitions. If he went ahead and did one of these three things, his male issue born from such union is no longer a priest (i.e. Kohen), but rather becomes a Ḥallal (Lev. 21:7, 14) - a term designating one who is no longer a priest, but profaned. A priest must maintain an untainted lineage, and his <b>mother</b> <b>must</b> be of Jewish birth. If he married a non-Jewish woman from the gentile nations, his children are no longer priests, but gentiles. Had a priest of Aaron's lineage transgressed this prohibition and married a divorced woman, and they had children together, all of his female issue - whether his, or his sons, or his grandchildren - would be prohibited from marrying into the priestly stock for all generations.|$|E

50|$|Because a phocid mother's feeding grounds {{are often}} {{hundreds}} of {{kilometers from the}} breeding site, she must fast while lactating. This combination of fasting with lactation requires the mother to provide large amounts of energy to her pup {{at a time when}} she is not eating (and often, not drinking). <b>Mothers</b> <b>must</b> supply their own metabolic needs while nursing. This is a miniature version of the humpback whales' strategy, which involves fasting during their months-long migration from arctic feeding areas to tropical breeding/nursing areas and back.|$|R
500|$|Two of {{the poems}} in And Still I Rise, [...] "Woman's Work" [...] and [...] "Momma's Welfare Roll", speak about women positively. [...] "Woman Work", without {{explaining}} or complaining, lists the mundane chores a stay-at-home wife and <b>mother</b> <b>must</b> accomplish. Neubauer compares the poem to [...] "Phenomenal Woman", both of which share the same strong rhyme scheme, forceful rhythms, and theme of women's vitality. [...] In [...] "Momma Welfare Roll", Angelou speaks about the courage of a mother who goes on welfare, and acknowledges the demeaning turmoil she experiences when accepting government assistance.|$|E

Andersen, author of Madonna: Unauthorized, described [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] as [...] "a wistfully psychedelic confection of carousels and pink elephants", adding that [...] "the song harkens back to the lullabies your <b>mother</b> <b>must</b> have sang to you". Robin Anne Reid, author of Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews, complimented the fact that [...] "although the sort of fantasies that [...] conjures might trend towards the kinky and sexual, she can also delve {{into a world of}} mermaids, fountains of youth, leprechauns and magic lanterns as is evident by 'Dear Jessie'." ...|$|E
