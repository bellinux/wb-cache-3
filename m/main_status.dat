40|$|The paper {{emphasizes}} the bipolar {{nature of the}} evaluation of decision results by making an explicit dis-tinction between prioritized goals to be pursued, and prioritized rejec-tions that are stumbling blocks to be avoided. This {{is the basis for}} an ar-gumentative framework for decision. Each decision is supported by argu-ments emphasizing its positive con-sequences in terms of goals satisfied, or rejections avoided by that deci-sion. A decision can also be attacked by arguments emphasizing its nega-tive consequences in terms of missed goals, or rejections reached by that decision. Thus, such bipolar setting provides a richer typology of arguments, and consequently rich principles for com-paring decisions.

Researchers have already created many different Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) schemes for EPON {{in order to meet the}} increasing bandwidth requirements of multiservice access.

The results of our study indicate that, on the one hand, the electricity output effect played a crucial role in increasing CO 2 emissions.

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} changes in parents' resolution regarding their young child's diagnosis of cerebral palsy {{over a period}} of 1 year, and to describe the changes in strategies of resolution. Methods: In this longitudinal study, 38 parents of children with cerebral palsy (mean age 18. 4 months, SD = 1. 1 at baseline) were followed with the Reaction to Diagnosis Interview, assessing their personal reactions to their child's diagnosis (i. e. resolution status). Changes at main and subclassification level of the Reaction to Diagnosis Interview were investigated using a binominal test. Results: Twenty-nine parents (76 %) were found to be stable with respect to their main resolution status (i. e. 'resolved' or 'unresolved'), while 24 % of the parents either had changed from 'unresolved' to 'resolved' or in the opposite way. Furthermore, of the 28 parents who were classified as 'resolved' at both times, 15 (54 %) had changed at subclassification level with respect to the specific strategies used. Conclusion: Resolution at a main level of parental reactions to their child's diagnosis was predominantly stable. Most parents were classified as 'resolved' at both baseline and follow-up assessment. However, more detailed analyses at subclassification level showed that most parents with a 'resolved' <b>main</b> <b>status</b> showed changing patterns of resolution strategies to their child's diagnosis, suggesting that resolution is an ongoing process. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Background For most parents, {{the birth}} of their child is a unique and {{touching}} moment. However, in some families a child is born with a physical disability. Among the large variety of childhood developmental disabilities, cerebral palsy (CP) is considered to be the major physical disability affecting the functional development of children. CP describes a group of disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitations that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain. A disability like CP may have serious consequences not only for a child’s functioning but also for the family. At present, the general perception of the family as the basic social unit within which to rear children has {{led to the development of}} family-centered approaches. Although professionals are gradually becoming aware of the important role of the family in a child’s life and initiatives to implement concepts of Family Centered Services (FCS) into rehabilitation practice have started, little is known about how parents adapt to the situation when their child is diagnosed with CP. Aim of the Thesis To gain knowledge about the process of adaptation of parents of young children with CP. Methods Parents of young (1. 5 yrs) children with cerebral palsy were followed for some years. They were interviewed regarding the resolution of diagnosis of their child and regarding their perceptions of family participation. Conclusion The majority of parents of children with CP have come to terms with this diagnosis by the time their children is 18 months old. More severe forms of CP (i. e. limited motor abilities) appear to confront parents with more difficulty with resolution than milder forms. Parental resolution regarding their child’s diagnosis seem to be predominantly stable. However, most parents with a “resolved” <b>main</b> <b>status</b> show changing patterns of resolution strategies to their child’s diagnosis, suggesting that resolution is an ongoing process. More concrete, among parents of teenage children, resolution seem to be more often apparent from a focus on action to better the lives of their children, whereas parents of younger children are more often focused on constructive thoughts and information seeking. A child with CP in a family may lead to parents perceiving restrictions in family participation. These restrictions arise early in the life of a child with CP and may become more prominent as the child grows older. These results show that having a child with CP may have a considerable impact on the parents and that there are differences in reactions and perceptions among parents. These differences support the fundamental idea that every family is unique. It is essential that professionals who work with families recognize the uniqueness of each family and have a thorough understanding of the organization and operation of the family. Professionals are able to support parents in ways that enable them to fulfil their role as parents. Therefore, counselling skills and knowledge about grief reactions are necessary...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This study was compiled using data from Waves 1 - 11 of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS - held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33196). The main objective of the research project {{was to investigate the}} impact of recall bias on measured labour market behaviour and to highlight how and to what degree the biases in the reported data may affect the estimation of models of labour market dynamics. The labour force histories in the BHPS provided a unique opportunity to analyse this potential bias by collecting information for the same time period from two different interviews (the 'wave overlaps'). Employment histories from the original data were constructed in two different ways, mimicking that which might be collected by repeated interview, and also that collected by a single retrospective interview. This allowed comparison of the measured labour dynamics from each approach. A 'reconciled' data set was also constructed as a base comparison, attempting to provide the most accurate picture of behaviour. For the second edition (December 2010), an updated version of the user guide was deposited. Changes have been made to the introductory text and the details given for the program bhpshist 3. Main Topics : The dataset consists of eight data files derived from data from the first 11 waves of the BHPS. Each dataset contains a record for each full interview provided by each individual. The data contain a series of variables defining the individual's labour force spells since leaving full-time education until the time of the interview. The spells are defined in terms of spell state, start date and end date. This series of spells has been used to construct summary measures of the number of months in employment since leaving full-time education and employer tenure in months. Each file contains the same variables and the same sample, but the employment history variables in each file have been constructed under different methods. Two types of data source and four construction methods define the eight data files. The two types of data sources consist of 'main activity' and 'all-work' sources. The 'main activity' information derives from questions about the individual's self-defined <b>main</b> <b>status,</b> while the 'all-work' sources aim to record all employment spells. At each interview in the BHPS, information on labour force spells is collected for a period extending prior to the previous interview. This can generate inconsistencies in the spells reported during this 'overlap' period. The four methods of construction are based on which source of information is used for this overlap period. The first method, called the 'traditional panel', ignores any information prior to previous interview. The second method, named 'latest interview rules' only uses information from previous interviews to complete gaps. The 'reconciled' method uses case-by-case correction of inconsistencies, while the final method, 'selected no problems', uses only those observations with no inconsistencies. <br...|$|E
