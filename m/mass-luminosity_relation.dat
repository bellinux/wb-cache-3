5|$|The mass, radius and {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} {{are closely}} interlinked, and their respective values can be approximated by three relations. First is the Stefan–Boltzmann law, which relates the luminosity L, the radius R and the surface temperature Teff. Second is the <b>mass–luminosity</b> <b>relation,</b> which relates the luminosity L and the mass M. Finally, the relationship between M and R is close to linear. The ratio of M to R increases {{by a factor of}} only three over 2.5 orders of magnitude of M. This relation is roughly proportional to the star's inner temperature TI, and its extremely slow increase reflects the fact that the rate of energy generation in the core strongly depends on this temperature, whereas it has to fit the <b>mass–luminosity</b> <b>relation.</b> Thus, a too high or too low temperature will result in stellar instability.|$|E
5|$|In high-mass main-sequence stars, the opacity is {{dominated}} by electron scattering, which is nearly constant with increasing temperature. Thus the luminosity only increases as the cube of the star's mass. For stars below 10 , the opacity becomes dependent on temperature, resulting in the luminosity varying approximately as the fourth power of the star's mass. For very low-mass stars, molecules in the atmosphere {{also contribute to the}} opacity. Below about 0.5 , the luminosity of the star varies as the mass to the power of 2.3, producing a flattening of the slope on a graph of mass versus luminosity. Even these refinements are only an approximation, however, and the <b>mass-luminosity</b> <b>relation</b> can vary depending on a star's composition.|$|E

40|$|Two {{problems}} {{about the}} faintest Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) Cepheids are addressed. On one hand evolutionary tracks fail {{to cross the}} Cepheid Instability Strip for the highest magnitudes (i. e. I-mag~ 17) where Cepheids are observed; <b>Mass-Luminosity</b> <b>relations</b> (ML) obtained from evolutionary tracks disagree with <b>Mass-Luminosity</b> <b>relations</b> derived from observations. We find that the above failures concern models built with standard input physics {{as well as with}} non-standard ones. The present work suggests that towards highest magnitudes, Cepheids stars undergo a selection effect caused by evolution: only the most metal poor stars cross the Instability Strip during the ``blue loop'' phase and are therefore the only ones which can be observed at low luminosity. This solution enables us to reproduce the shape of {{the lower part of the}} Instability Strip and improves the agreement between observed and theoretical ML-relations.

40|$|The virial mass (M_ vir) -metallicity {{relation}} {{among the}} Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) is examined. Hirashita, Takeuchi, & Tamura {{showed that the}} dSphs {{can be divided into}} two distinct classes with respect to the relation between their virial masses and luminosities: low-mass (M_ vir 10 ^ 8 M_) and high-mass (M_ vir 10 ^ 8 M_) groups. We see that both the mass-metallicity and the <b>mass-luminosity</b> <b>relations</b> of the high-mass dSphs are understood as a low-mass extension of giant ellipticals. On the contrary, we find that the classical galactic-wind model is problematic to apply to the low-mass dSphs, whose low binding energy is comparable to that released by several supernova explosions. A strongly regulated star formation in their formation phase is required to reproduce their observed metallicity. Such regulation is naturally expected in a gas cloud with the primordial elemental abundance according to Nishi & Tashiro. A significant scatter in the mass-metallicity relation for the low-mass dSphs is also successfully explained along with the scenario of Hirashita and coworkers. We not only propose a new picture for a chemical enrichment of the dSphs, but also suggest that the mass-metallicity and the <b>mass-luminosity</b> <b>relations</b> be understood in a consistent context.
