25|$|In 1954, KGO-TV {{moved to}} one of the most modern {{broadcasting}} facilities on the West Coast at the time at 277 Golden Gate Avenue, formerly known as the Eagle Building. The building was demolished between 2010 and 2011. As an ABC-owned station, KGO-TV originated a few network daytime shows, including programs hosted by fitness expert Jack La Lanne, singer Tennessee Ernie Ford, and entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee. Syndicated game shows Oh <b>My</b> <b>Word</b> and The Anniversary Game were produced at KGO-TV by Circle Seven Productions. In the mid-1950s, KGO-TV telecast live weeknight variety shows hosted by KSFO disc jockey Don Sherwood, until Sherwood was fired for making a political comment in defiance of a warning from station management. In September 1962, KGO began carrying ABC's first color program, the animated series The Jetsons, followed by The Flintstones. In the mid 1960s, KGO became the first Bay Area station to broadcast local programs in color, including its newscasts. In 1985, KGO-TV began broadcasting from its current studios at 900 Front Street, sharing the facility with radio stations KGO (AM 810), KSFO and KMKY (the former two are now owned by Cumulus Media).|$|E

500|$|The cantata {{is based}} on a text by Erdmann Neumeister written for the Eisenach court and {{published}} in Gotha in 1711 in the collection [...] (Sacred singing and playing), which had been set to music by Georg Philipp Telemann. It is one of few texts set to music in Weimar which were not written not by the court poet Salomon Franck. The text cites Isaiah in the second movement, [...] "For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, … So shall <b>my</b> <b>word</b> be ..." [...] (...) , related to the Gospel about God's word compared to seed. In the third movement, the poet combines warnings of the dangers to God's word in the style of a sermon with four lines of prayer from a litany by Martin Luther.

[...] When Brock's Monument opened in 1831, Secord learned the new Lieutenant-Governor, John Colborne, intended to give the keys to the widow of a member of the monument committee who had died in an accident. [...] On 17 July 1831, Secord petitioned Colborne to honour Maitland's promise, and included another certificate from FitzGibbon attesting her contribution to the war.

These {{appearances}} included Bitter Springs (mentioned above) and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978), {{the first of}} two films in which he appeared alongside Jack Thompson. Dodd played the character of Tabidgi, the uncle of the lead character, Aboriginal man Jimmie Blacksmith. In the film, Jimmie Blacksmith marries a white woman named Gilda Marshall (played by Angela Punch McGregor). When they have a baby, Dodd's character, [...] "a tribal elder,... is worried about Jimmie's marriage to a white woman and has brought him a talisman to keep him safe". Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, described the performances of the two black professional actors (Jack Charles and Dodd) as [...] "wonderful as sots:...

500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers.

The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster.

500|$|Because Never Say Never Again {{is not an}} Eon-produced film, it has {{not been}} {{included}} in a number of subsequent reviews.

But take <b>my</b> <b>word</b> for it; they're both pretty awful". Of the more recent reviews, opinion on Never Say Never Again is still mixed: film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes lists the film with a 63% rating from 46 reviews. The score is still more positive than some of the Eon films, with Rotten Tomatoes ranking Never Say Never Again 16th among all Bond films in 2008. Empire gives the film three of a possible five stars, observing that [...] "Connery was perhaps wise to call it quits the first time round". IGN gave Never Say Never Again a score of 5 out of 10, claiming that the film [...] "is more miss than hit". The review also thought that the film was [...] "marred with too many clunky exposition scenes and not enough moments of Bond being Bond".|$|E

500|$|Franck's text shows {{elements}} of early Pietism: {{the expression of}} extreme feelings, for example [...] "O seligste Zeiten!" [...] (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a [...] "mystical demeanour", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to [...] "" [...] (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His [...] temple, more literally: [...] "God wants to prepare [...] souls to become his temples"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, [...] "" [...] (Whoever loves Me will keep <b>My</b> <b>Word,</b> and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that {{was present at the}} Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn [...] "", which is based on the Latin hymn [...] "Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium". Movement 6 is a chorale, verse four of Philipp Nicolai's hymn [...] "". Nicolai's [...] "Geistlich Brautlied" [...] (Spiritual bridal song) continues the theme of unity between Soul and Spirit.|$|E
500|$|Delft, {{captured}} {{in the early stages}} of the battle, was under the command of the Dutch Lieutenant Heilberg and the British Lieutenant Charles Bullen, with a small prize crew of 69 men. Ninety-three Dutch prisoners had been removed, and among the remaining Dutch sailors were 76 wounded men. As the gale intensified, it rapidly became clear that despite a tow line attached from Veteran the ship would never reach Britain, and a large board was raised on deck with the chalked message [...] "The ship is sinking". Reacting at once, boats from nearby ships organised an evacuation and began loading the Dutch prisoners for transfer to more seaworthy vessels. Bullen offered a place in the first rescue boat, from Veteran, to Heilberg, but the Dutch officer refused, gesturing to the immobile wounded who had been brought onto the maindeck as the lower decks had flooded and replying [...] "But how can I leave these men?". In response, Bullen cried out [...] "God bless you, my brave fellow! Here is my hand; I give you <b>my</b> <b>word</b> I will stay her with you!". The prize crew left on the second rescue boat sent from Russell, and Bullen and Heilberg waited for a third trip to bring them off with the remaining 30 wounded men and three junior Dutch officers who had also elected to stay. Before further help could arrive, however, Delft suddenly foundered, Bullen and Heilberg throwing themselves clear as the ship sank. Both were seen in the water but only Bullen reached safety, swimming to Monmouth alone.|$|E

Lody claimed that he had asked in August to be erased from military service on the grounds of poor health and to be allowed to travel to the United States. This was refused, he went on, but a member of naval intelligence whom he had previously never met coaxed him into undertaking a mission in the UK on the condition that he could go to the US afterwards.
