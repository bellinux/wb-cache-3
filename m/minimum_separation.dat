Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near perihelion, Neptune is over 50° behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be nearly 130° ahead of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's <b>minimum</b> <b>separation</b> is over 17AU, which is greater than Pluto's <b>minimum</b> <b>separation</b> from Uranus (11AU).

40|$|Multi-Aircraft Conflict Resolution (MACR) is a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem, which {{involves}} multiple stakeholders (airline, air traffic controller, and aircraft) with competing and incommensurable objectives. This paper proposes a two-step MCDM scheme {{to the solution}} of MACR. In the first step, a second order cone program is adopted to generate a set of candidate resolution strategies with different <b>minimum</b> <b>separations</b> between trajectories. Each candidate strategy is then evaluated via three criteria modeling {{the interests of the}} stakeholders. In the second step, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach is used to determine the best strategy that realizes an adequate tradeoff among the competing interests while coping with their incommensurability. Some numerical results are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed scheme. Interestingly, the <b>minimum</b> <b>separations</b> associated with the best resolution strategies according to either the interest of the airline or that of the aircraft both differ from the one adopted in the current air traffic control operation...|$|R

50|$|In astronomy, one often {{measures}} {{spatial resolution}} in data points per arcsecond subtended {{at the point}} of observation, because the physical distance between objects in the image depends on their distance away and this varies widely with the object of interest. On the other hand, in electron microscopy, line or fringe resolution refers to the <b>minimum</b> <b>separation</b> detectable between adjacent parallel lines (e.g. between planes of atoms), whereas point resolution instead refers to the <b>minimum</b> <b>separation</b> between adjacent points that can be both detected and interpreted e.g. as adjacent columns of atoms, for instance. The former often helps one detect periodicity in specimens, whereas the latter (although more difficult to achieve) is key to visualizing how individual atoms interact.|$|E

One shortcoming of this technique is that it removes the possibility of registering transient signals. As a consequence the simultaneous averaging of spatially related leads has been used.
