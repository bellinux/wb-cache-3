In this study, the effect of <b>melt</b> <b>blending</b> on the interfacial interaction between thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRG) and polycarbonate (PC) had been investigated. Ultracentrifugation of the melt-mixed PC/TRG composite solutions led to dark-colored supernatants, indicating the improved dispersion of TRG in some solvents, suggesting the existence of enhanced interfacial interaction between TRG and PC. The shift of C=O stretching vibration of PC (interacted with TRG) in the FT-IR spectra {{as well as the}} shift of absorption peak of phenyl groups in the UV–vis spectra suggested the formation of chemical bonding between the carbonate groups in PC chains and the carboxyl groups on TRG through transesterification and the formation of noncovalentp–pstacking interaction between PC and TRG during <b>melt</b> <b>blending.</b> Furthermore, the effect of <b>melt</b> <b>blending</b> on mechanical reinforcement of the PC/TRG composites was also evaluated...|$|R

Neat nylon 6 and single end-gated samples are used as a control, allowing comparison the performance of nylon 6 nanocomposites when weld line is present.

40|$|A {{new high}} speed and {{potentially}} economical method {{of creating a}} composite material and structures therefrom is tested. The method consists of spinning composite fibers from a <b>melt</b> <b>blend</b> of a thermoplastic with a liquid crystal polymer (LCP). Discontinuous fibrils of the LCP are formed in situ during the spinning process. These composite fibers are aligned {{and placed in a}} mold and heated to melt the thermoplastic matrix, but not the fibrils. A finished composite structure reinforced by the LCP fibrils is obtained when the thermoplastic phase is consequently consolidated. Our experiments show the proposed process is reasonable for an easily processed polystyrene matrix. High modulus fibrils with essentially infinite L/D ratios are readily produced in the extrusion process using 40 wt% of a wholly aromatic poly(ester-co-amide) LCP from Celanese. The integrity and alignment of the LCP fibrils is retained in the molding step. Mechanical tests show that the fibers produced by high shear rate processing have a stiffness approaching 23 GPa and match an axial rule-of-mixtures theory.

In the third part, the composition of NBR added in the blend was at 20, 25 and 30 % by weight. The results showed phase separation between PLA and NBR. Tensile strength and tensile modulus were found decreased with the content of NBR whereas elongation at break was increased with NBR content, up to 10 % NBR, then the elongation was decreased. Thermal stability of PLA was enhanced by the addition of NBR. For dynamic vulcanized NBR in PLA, the two phases was shown more compatible. Tensile elongation of PLA/dynamic vulcanized NBR blend was improved about 700 - 1100 % compared to neat PLA. It was found that at 20 % of NBR tensile elongation was increased about 1120 %. Tensile strength and modulus of thermoplastic vulcanizate of PLA/NBR (PLA/NBR TPV) were found decreased 37 % and 65 % respectively, compared to neat PLA. The PLA/NBR TPV showed drawback in crystallization meanwhile thermal stability was very much improved. In order to improve mechanical properties of PLA/NBR TPV, OMMT was added.

The elongation at break of poly(lactic acid) /liquid natural rubber increased significantly as compared to nanocomposite with 1 % of C 30 B, i. e. from 37. 3 % to 62. 4 %. Nevertheless, the elongation at break and impact strength decreased gradually when nanoclay content increased above 3 %, suggesting the addition of clay changed the strain response in the blend systems. The incorporation of nanoclay in the poly(lactic acid) /liquid natural rubber blends lowered the glass transition temperature values relative to poly(lactic acid).

40|$|Bitumen {{otherwise}} known as asphalt is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons which are naturally occurring or obtained from crude oil distillation. Bitumen when used as a binder in road pavement deteriorates with time as result of traffic load and contact of the pavement with environmental factors. The degradation of bitumen causes a rapid aging of the asphalt based pavement leading to road problems such as rutting, potholes etc. This deterioration is attributed to oxidative degradation of molecules of bitumen by factors such as heat, moisture and sunlight. This study investigates the viability of using polyphosphoric acid (PPA) to reduce the oxidative degradation effect of heat (at 60 oC) on constituents of Agbabu Natural Bitumen (ANB) {{with a view to}} making it more durable when used for road pavement.

The result showed that aging indexes of PPA modified samples of ANB were lower compared with that of the neat or unmodified samples of ANB. This implies that the rate of aging (at 60 oC) of the unmodified ANB was faster than that of PPA modified ANB. Thus, a good potential for reducing thermal aging in ANB was found in PPA. ...|$|E

In this work, the preparation of PP/nanoclay composites began by exchanging the originals of natural layered clay for octadecylamine and N-methylundecenylamine. This modification yielded the desired intercalated clay structure. The ability of well-controlled stereospecific hydroxyl-functionalized polypropylene (PP-co-OH) compatibilizer to enable the PP-matrix to penetrate between the modified clay sheets and the properties of the resulting polymer/nanocomposite were studied. Also, a non-polar PP-based wax was tested as a compatibilizer in the composites, but the desired clay nanostructure was not achieved. The PP-co-OH was shown to be almost as effective a compatibilizer as the well-known maleinic anhydride-grafted polypropylene.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This thesis looks at the study of nanocomposites of Poly(ethylene terephthalate) and organoclays. Two methods of materials blending are investigated {{for the production of}} the nanocomposites: solvent <b>blending</b> and <b>melt</b> <b>blending.</b> The main objectives were the investigation of the influence of organoclays and processing conditions on morphological, rheological, mechanical properties, crystal structure and isothermal crystallization kinetics of the nanocomposite and a comparison with unfilled PET. In solvent blending, the use of long sonication time and epoxy {{led to the formation of}} a two-dimensional network structure of long, thin particles in a solvent blended PET nanocomposite at low clay loading. The clay network structure seemed not to affect the tensile properties. The long, thin particles were able to be separated and dispersed further by high shear in a twin screw extruder, resulting in a high level of separation and dispersion. The crystallization of the solvent blended nanocomposite was not only influenced by the nanoclay but also by the residual solvent. The extent of clay dispersion did not affect the crystallization of the solvent blended sample. Both solvent <b>blended</b> and <b>melt</b> <b>blended</b> nanocomposites showed that increasing the amount of surfactant improved the degree of nanoclay dispersion in the PET that led to an enhancement in the tensile properties of the nanocomposite compared to the unfilled polymer. The degradation of the organoclay during <b>melt</b> <b>blending</b> did not limit the nanoclay dispersion in the PET. The low thermal stability of the organoclay reduced the strength of the crystalline nanocomposite but it did not affect the strength of the amorphous nanocomposite. In contrast to the solvent blended sample, the extent of clay dispersion influenced the crystallization of the <b>melt</b> <b>blended</b> sample. The poorly dispersed particles were more efficient in nucleating PET crystallization than the well dispersed particles. The crystallization rate of PET increased as the surfactant concentration decreased...|$|R

The crystallization of the nanocomposites is subsequently discussed using X-ray diffraction combined with Raman analysis.|$|R
