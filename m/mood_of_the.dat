5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> record, but the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
5|$|Extra Texture (Read All About It) is {{the sixth}} studio album by English {{musician}} George Harrison, released in September 1975. It was Harrison's final album under {{his contract with}} Apple Records and EMI, and the last studio album issued by Apple. The release came nine months after his troubled 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar and the poorly received Dark Horse album. The melancholic <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recording reflects Harrison's depressed state at the criticism generated by these projects.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} {{months of the}} war, Hand {{increasingly}} supported President Woodrow Wilson's post-war foreign policy objectives. He believed the United States should endorse the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles, despite their flaws. This position estranged him from Croly and others at The New Republic, who vehemently rejected both. Alienated from his old circle on the magazine and by the reactionary and isolationist <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, Hand found himself politically homeless.|$|E

50|$|Group affective tone is an {{aggregate}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group and refers to mood at <b>the</b> group level <b>of</b> analysis. If <b>the</b> <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual group members are consistent, then group affective tone {{can be treated}} as a group property. If, for example, members of a group tend to be excited, energetic and enthusiastic, then the group itself can be described as being excited, energetic and enthusiastic. If the group members tend to be distressed, mistrustful and nervous, then the group can also be described in these terms. Not all groups possess an affective tone; members of some groups do not experience similar moods. Even so, past research indicates that a majority of groups possess an affective tone.|$|R

5|$|Reitz's {{policies}} were appreciated by the Volksraad, reflecting {{the change in}} the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Afrikaner electorate towards Afrikaner nationalism. Months before the presidential election of 1893 the Volksraad endorsed Reitz's candidature with a vote of forty-three against eighteen. Reitz accepted the endorsement on the condition that he be allowed three months leave to Europe. On 22 November 1893 he was re-elected, again with a landslide majority.|$|E
5|$|The Easter Rising of 1916 {{was carried}} out by the latter group {{together}} with a smaller socialist militia, the Irish Citizen Army. The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country in favour of the rebels. Support for Irish republicanism increased further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the Conscription Crisis of 1918.|$|E

And second, to explore and evaluate whether participation in a theatrical performance program had {{a positive effect on}} <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adolescents who have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The statistical findings indicated that there were significant initial and concluding differences in <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adolescents who have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and their able-bodied cohorts.

5|$|During the {{build-up}} to the 1978 FIFA World Cup, MacLeod fuelled {{the hopes}} of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home with a medal. As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they were given an enthusiastic send-off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America. Scotland's first game was against Peru in Córdoba. Two spectacular goals by Teófilo Cubillas meant that {{the result was a}} 3–1 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against Iran. The disconsolate <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–589), {{painting}} {{had become an}} art of high sophistication that {{was associated with the}} gentry class as one of their main artistic pastimes, the others being calligraphy and poetry. During the Song dynasty there were avid art collectors that would often meet in groups to discuss their own paintings, as well as rate those of their colleagues and friends. The poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101) and his accomplice Mi Fu (1051–1107) often partook in these affairs, borrowing art pieces to study and copy, or if they really admired a piece then an exchange was often proposed. The small round paintings popular in the Southern Song were often collected into albums as poets would write poems along the side to match the theme and <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> painting.|$|E
5|$|Hopes {{that the}} ballet {{would be ready}} in May were dashed and the opening night was {{postponed}} several times. Grisi was absent {{for a few days}} and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb {{at the end of the}} ballet, it was decided that she would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act II finale.|$|E
2500|$|The Georgian verbal {{system is}} {{extremely}} complex, especially {{when compared to}} those of most Indo-European languages. Rather than using the terms [...] "tense", [...] "aspect", [...] "mood", etc. separately, linguists prefer {{to use the term}} [...] "screeve" [...] to distinguish between different time frames and <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verbal system. A screeve is a set of six verb forms inflected for person and number.|$|R
50|$|Deseret News {{art critic}} Richard P. Christenson wrote the following: “After high school, Kenneth joined the Navy and sailed {{extensively}} among the South Pacific islands.

50|$|Darwish {{believed}} that genuine art must {{be derived from}} people's aspirations and feelings. In his music and songs, he truly expressed <b>the</b> yearnings and <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> masses, as well as recording the events that took place during his lifetime. He dealt with the aroused national feeling against the British occupiers, <b>the</b> passion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people, and social justice, and he often criticized <b>the</b> negative aspects <b>of</b> Egyptian society.|$|R
5|$|Lombard {{was eager}} to win an Academy Award, and {{selected}} her next project—from several possible scripts—with the expectation that it would bring her the trophy. Vigil in the Night (1940), directed by George Stevens, featured Lombard as a nurse who faces a series of personal difficulties. Although the performance was praised, she did not get her nomination, as the sombre <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picture turned audiences away and box-office returns were poor. Despite the realization that she was best suited to comedies, Lombard completed one more drama: They Knew What They Wanted (1940), co-starring Charles Laughton, which was mildly successful.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{cynical and}} despairing over his recent break-up with ex-girlfriend Felicia, the normally-grumpy Bolander (Ned Beatty) is unusually cheerful {{as a result}} of his budding romantic relationship with Linda (Julianna Margulies), a much younger (26-year-old) waitress. Nervous about his first real date with her, Bolander asks Howard (Melissa Leo) to go on a double-date with him, along with Howard's boyfriend, prosecuting attorney Ed Danvers (Željko Ivanek). The double date goes well until a lonely Munch crashes, joins the table and ruins the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening complaining about his romantic woes. Bolander, Munch and Linda leave together and walk to Fort McHenry, where Linda offers Munch words of encouragement. Impressed with her, Munch leaves Linda and Bolander alone, where they happily watch a fireworks show.|$|E

For his train ride to the nation's capital, Obama rode in the Georgia300, a vintage railroad car used by past presidents and the same one he used for touring Pennsylvania during his presidential primary campaign. On the tour, Obama was accompanied by his wife Michelle, their daughters Malia and Sasha, and a host of friends and guests.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a full-length opera, Twice was composed between 1994 and 1996, undergoing substantial reworking before Turnage found a form with which he was satisfied. It was first performed in 1997 when it was put on both in the concert hall and in the opera house. The critical reception has been generally favourable, with several authors commenting positively about the instrumental writing and emotional impact of the work, though some critics see limitations in the libretto, find the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work too unrelenting or note the great demands that the vocal writing provides for the soloist.|$|E
5|$|Over one {{thousand}} artists and technicians {{were used in}} the making of Fantasia, which features more than 500 animated characters. Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between proceeding and following ones. Before a segment's narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music, and patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter. The studio's character model department would also sculpt three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles.|$|E
5|$|The report divided Sa-iap {{history into}} four periods. Before 1937, {{the village was}} {{self-sustaining}} and used both farming and gathering for {{the overwhelming majority of}} its needs. In 1937, the Thai government allowed private companies to log the forest, destroying part of the villages' infrastructure. In 1957, the villagers entered the employ of the logging companies, causing internal and external conflict as well as increased reliance on unsustainable practices. Finally, in 1991 the villagers formed a conservation group, the Forest Lover Group, which the Chaobaan researchers agreed cut down on conflict. The <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> villages has returned to one of mutual assistance and traditional customs.|$|E

5|$|The sea {{and ships}} have been {{depicted}} in art ranging from simple drawings on <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> huts in Lamu to seascapes by Joseph Turner and Dutch Golden Age painting. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour prints <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea, including The Great Wave off Kanagawa. The sea {{has appeared in}} literature since Homer's Odyssey (8th century BC). The sea is a recurring theme in <b>the</b> Haiku poems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese Edo period poet Matsuo Bashō (松尾 芭蕉) (1644–1694).|$|R
40|$|In Virgil’s Aeneid, {{the hero}} is epic enough but is {{importantly}} different enough from <b>the</b> tradition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek epic hero to warrant investigation. At <b>the</b> crux <b>of</b> {{it is that}} Virgil utilizes a Roman approach to the Greek cosmos. Thus the hero reflects the political changes and <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> times. This paper traces how Virgil’s use of language constructs this Roman vision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek cosmos. In the end it suggests that humans in Virgil’s world have a greater task than they did before and that only the pious will survive...|$|R
5|$|A Hero's Song is musically {{structured}} like a four-movement symphony, {{beginning with}} an allegro con fuoco, transitioning {{to a slow}} poco adagio lacrimosa, then including a scherzo and concluding with a coda. The piece {{is based on a}} short, energetic theme in B minor played in the violas, cellos, and basses {{at the start of the}} piece. This theme is featured in various forms throughout the first section. Following this, a slow section is marked by quiet music which symbolizes the hero's grief. It includes a funeral march, a musical form Dvořák also used in his Requiem, Stabat Mater, and Piano Quintet No. 2. The hero recovers from his grief as the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music gradually brightens and goes into B major, leading into the dance-like scherzo. Finally, the triumph of the hero is represented by the victorious coda. The piece has a run time of approximately 22 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa's three {{consecutive}} movies after Seven Samurai had not managed to capture Japanese audiences {{in the way}} that that film had. The <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> director's work had been growing increasingly pessimistic and dark, with the possibility of redemption through personal responsibility now very much questioned, particularly in Throne of Blood and The Lower Depths. He recognized this, and deliberately aimed for a more light-hearted and entertaining film for his next production, while switching to the new widescreen format that had been gaining popularity in Japan. The resulting film, The Hidden Fortress, is an action-adventure comedy-drama about a medieval princess, her loyal general and two peasants who all need to travel through enemy lines in order to reach their home region. Released in December 1958, The Hidden Fortress became an enormous box office success in Japan and was warmly received by critics both in Japan and abroad. Today, the film is considered one of Kurosawa's most lightweight efforts, though it remains popular, not least because it is one of several major influences on George Lucas's 1977 space opera, Star Wars.|$|E
5|$|On {{leaving the}} Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns {{accepted}} {{the post of}} organist at the ancient Parisian church of Saint-Merri near the Hôtel de Ville. The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year {{there were more than}} two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income. The organ, the work of François-Henri Clicquot, had been badly damaged {{in the aftermath of the}} French Revolution and imperfectly restored. The instrument was adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered. With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E (1853). This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> times in the wake of the popular rise to power of Napoleon III and the restoration of the French Empire. The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile.|$|E
2500|$|The Rabana is a flat faced {{circular}} {{drum and}} comes in several sizes.

40|$|Background: People with {{profound}} intellectual disabilities experience a high prevalence of visual disabilities, {{making them more}} dependent on sound. However, research addressing <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auditory environment is scarce. Method: Observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auditory environments (soundscapes) and <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> people {{with profound}} intellectual and visual disabilities, in terms of core affect, were conducted in residential facilities by direct support personnel. Appraisals of soundscape and core affect dimensions were combined and analysed by means of multi-level linear regression. Results: Findings endorse {{a positive relationship between}} the observed pleasantness and eventfulness of soundscapes and core affect of people with profound intellectual and visual disabilities. Conclusion: This study suggests a relationship between soundscapes and <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> people with profound intellectual and visual disabilities, as judged by staff members engaged in their environments. These findings give reason to believe that improved soundscapes could ameliorate <b>the</b> <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residents...|$|R
