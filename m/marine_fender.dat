40|$|Contact {{damage to}} side {{structures}} of an offshore supply vessel (OSV) {{takes place in}} the form of local denting of plating between stiffeners, permanent deformation in side frames, buckling of deck beams, and local buckling in web frames and decks. During berthing operations when an OSV comes alongside a pier or an offshore installation, it may come into contact with the other structures and may expose its side structure to very large local loads, resulting in local contact damage. Traditionally, contact damage was rarely addressed, or treated in a rather simplistic manner in structural design codes. Normally, it was believed that such damage could be minimized or mitigated through crew training and improving OSV operations. In the recent improvement of classification rules, design formulae are included that guide designs of side shell plating against a possible contact event. In general, the mechanism of a contact event is less understood, and the related structural designs have received very limited attention. The latest design formulation in IACS common scantlings rules is a good step forward toward a more rationalized design approach, but comprehensive design guidance is still lacking, and it remains to be defined what the limits of operation will be, beyond which contact damage may occur. This paper aims to shed light on the mechanisms of events leading to contact damage. Discussions include ship motion, local impact load due to contact, structural responses, and range of acceptance criteria. The paper reviews the state-of-the-art technology surrounding the issue, available experience data, development in <b>marine</b> <b>fender</b> industry, and internationally recognized operational procedures. Based on these surveys, an easy-to-use, yet more rationally based, procedure is presented that can be easily incorporated into design standards. Calculation examples are shown and implications to structural designs are discussed. It is expected that this research paves the way for developing or improving structural design procedures for an important design issue that has not been given enough attention...|$|E

Bridgestone supply Multi-Rubber Bearings for installing in foundations to protect buildings from earthquakes, inflatable rubber dams for managing waterways (no longer manufactured â€“ 2008), <b>marine</b> <b>fenders</b> for protecting wharves, additives for pavement, waterproofing sheet, rubberized ceiling and roofing materials, panel tanks for storing water, bath fixtures and residential flooring, {{air and water}} systems.|$|R
50|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>fenders</b> {{are used}} at ports and docks on quay walls and other {{berthing}} structures. They absorb the kinetic {{energy of a}} berthing vessel and thus prevent damage to the vessel or the berthing structure. There are 2 major categories of fenders for port applications: Fixed and Floating. Fixed fenders are mounted to the berth structure and compose of buckling fenders such as cell fenders, V-type fenders, and non-buckling fenders such as cylindrical fenders. Floating fenders are placed between the berth structure and ship, and include pneumatic fenders and foam-filled fenders.|$|R
40|$|This study {{discusses}} an iterative {{approach to}} the problem of a continuous beam on discrete non-linear elastic supports and its application. The literature studied revealed that practically no work has been done on engineering approaches to this problem. The basic equations are developed from flexural theory and are solved by iteration utilizing Newton' s linear approximation method. The solutions obtained were checked by energy methods. Numerical results are presented for a <b>marine</b> <b>fendering</b> system, a typical example of a beam on non-linear elastic supports. For various loading conditions, a comparison is made between an approximate linear solution and the solution obtained using the non-linear approach developed in this study...|$|R
40|$|A Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH) Test Level 4 (TL- 4) energy-absorbing, urban roadside/median barrier was {{developed}} to reduce lateral vehicle accelerations below those observed during similar crashes into permanent concrete barriers. Several types of energy absorbers were evaluated for use in this barrier. Elastic polymers, or elastomers, have superior restorability, reusability, compressibility, and resistance to environmental effects. Although many shapes were explored, conical-shaped, cylindrical-shaped, and shear fender elastomers {{were found to be}} the most efficient in terms of size, weight, ease of use, and energy absorption. Finite element analysis simulations were used to further study the energy absorption and deflection of the elastomer shapes. One point nodal pressure tetrahedron solid elements accurately modeled the deformation of rubber. The best elastomer material models in LS-DYNA were the Simplified Rubber/Foam and the Blatz-Ko Rubber models, which were validated through component tests. Component tests were conducted at 5 mph on (1) an 80 -durometer, 2 -in. thick cylinder, (2) a 60 -durometer, 2 -in. thick cylinder, and (3) an 80 -durometer, 1 -in. thick cylinder. Components tests were also conducted at speeds varying from 5 mph to 15 mph on a 16 -in. high, 14 -in. wide, and 22 -in. long <b>marine</b> shear <b>fender.</b> ^ The final design consisted of an open concrete rail with shear fender rubber posts that are anchored to a concrete foundation. The precast concrete beams measured 22 in. wide, 20 in. tall, and 20 ft long and were spliced on top of 16 -in. high, 14 -in. wide, and 22 -in. long shear fender posts, which were spaced at 10 ft on center. Finite element analysis simulations also demonstrated that lateral vehicle accelerations were reduced by up to 33 percent for a MASH TL- 4 small car impact and up to 29 percent for a MASH TL- 4 pickup truck impact into the new barrier as compared to a rigid concrete barrier. Simulations also demonstrated that the new barrier had adequate capacity to contain the MASH TL- 4 single-unit truck. The cost of the barrier was estimated to be $ 175 /ft. The barrier should be further evaluated using finite element simulations and full-scale crash testing. ...|$|R
