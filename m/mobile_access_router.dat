40|$|Abstract – This paper {{proposes a}} dynamic QoS {{provisioning}} model for network mobility. The basic idea of network mobility (NEMO) {{is to keep}} connectivity whilst the network changes its point of attachment. To achieve this, sufficient resources need to be provisioned for the entire mobile network. In our model, the packets are prioritized and classified according to the services they are subscribed to i. e. premium services or user services. Packets that are marked according to the traffic classes are then aggregated as a single request in a QoS Object in the packet header which is then sent along with the NEMO binding update message for resource reservation. QoS agents in the <b>mobile</b> <b>router</b> and <b>access</b> <b>router</b> determine whether to either send the QoS Object as a destination option or hop-by-hop option. I...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we make a}} {{case for}} {{exploiting}} the inherent network diversity in wireless access available from different wireless and cellular networks, and of the operators {{that can be used to}} provide a sufficiently sustainable and reliable wireless communication link. Based on a real-world example of cellular networks that are currently deployed in a (small) town in the U. K., we show that there is a substantial overlap in terms of coverage being offered by most operators (e. g. Vodafone, Orange etc.), and also currently to some extent even across networks (e. g. GPRS, 3 G and/or WLANs). We advocate that diversity in wireless access from cellular and other types of wireless access networks can be exploited to aggregate bandwidths from multiple network interfaces simultaneously in order to provide a fairly reliable communication link. We also give experimental evidence on the impact mobility can have in such environments, and discuss why bandwidth aggregation using simultaneous wireless access in this environment is useful.

40|$|Abstract- With {{the rapid}} growth of the Internet and mobile {{wireless}} technologies, an ever-increasing requirement on securing services between <b>mobile</b> users and <b>access</b> networks has become especially important. When 1 a user roams into a foreign network, in addition to data confidentiality, mutual authentication between the user and the provider is also a vital issue. These concerns and the desire to stay seamlessly connected lead to the demand of fast authentication and key establishment mechanisms, which are particularly difficult in inter-domain handover scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel mechanism to provide a simple but effective method, which forwards the key from the previous <b>access</b> <b>router</b> to the new <b>access</b> <b>router</b> that the <b>mobile</b> node attaches to. With this mechanism, trust relationship can be re-established even if the <b>access</b> <b>routers</b> do not trust each other in such an inter-domain scenario.
