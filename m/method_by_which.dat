5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1907, Baden-Powell went on an {{extensive}} speaking tour arranged by his publisher, Arthur Pearson, to promote his forthcoming book, Scouting for Boys. He had not simply rewritten his Aids to Scouting; he omitted the military aspects and transferred the techniques (mainly survival) to non-military heroes: backwoodsmen, explorers (and later on, sailors and airmen). He also added innovative educational principles (the Scout <b>method)</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> he extended the attractive game to a personal mental education.|$|E

5|$|Before Rommel was {{assigned}} {{defense of the}} Atlantic Wall, obstacles to amphibious landing were being built upon the beaches of Belgium and France. On February 3, 1944 {{during a visit to}} the beach at Neufchâtel-Hardelot, Rommel was shown a <b>method</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> local troops employed a high pressure water hose to quickly create a hole in beach sand, one which could be used to set high wooden stakes (Hochpfähle) into the beach as an obstacle to landing craft. The water hose method took three minutes, fifteen times faster than using a pile driver. Rommel ordered such methods to be used to place wooden beams, metal rails and other obstructions along the beaches of Normandy. Nearly 11,000 were emplaced in the south part of Normandy's coastline where the Allies would eventually land.|$|E
5|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} is a <b>method</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> diamond can {{be grown}} from a hydrocarbon gas mixture. Since the early 1980s, this method {{has been the subject}} of intensive worldwide research. Whereas the mass-production of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the more suitable choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and simplicity of CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in laboratory research. The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the fine control over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high pressures, as the growth typically occurs at pressures under 27 kPa.|$|E
5|$|Heavy atom methods (multiple {{isomorphous}} replacement)– If electron-dense metal atoms can {{be introduced}} into the crystal, direct methods or Patterson-space methods {{can be used to}} determine their location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by soaking the crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals {{in the presence of a}} heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original <b>method</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.|$|E

5|$|In Part II of the 1978 Spanish constitution, among {{provisions}} {{concerning the}} Crown, Article 62(a) invests the sanction (i.e. Royal Assent) and promulgation of laws with the monarch of Spain. Chapter 2 of Part III, concerning the Drafting of Bills, outlines the <b>method</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> bills are passed. According to Article 91, the monarch shall give {{his or her}} assent and promulgate the new law within fifteen days of passage of a bill by the Cortes Generales. Article 92 invests the monarch {{with the right to}} call for a referendum, on the advice {{of the president of the}} government (commonly referred to in English as the prime minister) and the authorisation of the cortes.|$|E
5|$|Royal assent or {{sanction}} is the <b>method</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> a country's monarch (possibly {{through a}} delegated official) formally approves {{an act of}} that nation's parliament. In certain nations, such assent makes the act law (promulgation) while in other nations assent is distinct from promulgation. In {{the vast majority of}} contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their monarchs to withhold royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies, it is exceedingly rare in the modern, democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{insertion}} were considered, {{both for the}} paras and the special forces personnel, including an overland approach using four-wheel drive vehicles, and a water-borne insertion using the same <b>method</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> the SAS observation teams had arrived at their position. The planning group decided that the overland approach would not allow troops to enter the village undetected, {{largely due to the}} West Side Boys' roadblocks on the road into the village, and that insertion from Rokel Creek was not feasible for large numbers of troops due to the sandbanks and powerful currents in the river. Thus, it was decided that the insertions would be made from three Royal Air Force Chinook helicopters from No. 7 Squadron, which had been in Sierra Leone since the beginning of Operation Palliser.|$|E

5|$|The filters {{designed}} by Campbell were named wave filters {{because of their}} property of passing some waves and strongly rejecting others. The <b>method</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> they were designed was called the image parameter method and filters designed to this method are called image filters. The image method essentially consists of developing the transmission constants of an infinite chain of identical filter sections and then terminating the desired finite number of filter sections in the image impedance. This exactly corresponds {{to the way the}} properties of a finite length of transmission line are derived from the theoretical properties of an infinite line, the image impedance corresponding to the characteristic impedance of the line.|$|E
5|$|The various {{planets are}} thought to have formed from the solar nebula, the {{disc-shaped}} cloud of gas and dust left over from the Sun's formation. The currently accepted <b>method</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> the planets formed is accretion, in which the planets began as dust grains in orbit around the central protostar. Through direct contact, these grains formed into clumps up to 200 metres in diameter, which in turn collided to form larger bodies (planetesimals) of ~10kilometres (km) in size. These gradually increased through further collisions, growing at the rate of centimetres per year {{over the course of the}} next few million years.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy, which {{involves the use of}} coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment. This sort of protective coloration is common and widespread among beetle families, especially those that feed on wood or vegetation, such as many of the leaf beetles (family Chrysomelidae) or weevils. In some of these species, sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate. Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves, and the bodies of some species (such as O. macklotti and Palophus centaurus) are covered in mossy or lichenous outgrowths that supplement their disguise. Some species have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift (B. scabrinota, T. californica). In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis, a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze. Another <b>method</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death (catalepsy), where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period. The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also aids Phasmatodea in remaining concealed from predators.|$|E

5|$|Each Civilization in The Age of Kings has {{one or two}} special {{units that}} are {{exclusive}} to that Civilization. For instance, the Britons have access to longbowmen, an archery unit with increased range. These Civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but still follow the basic rock-paper-scissors model. The monk is {{a special kind of}} military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player's civilization, and to heal allied units. Monks are also used to collect relics; relics accumulate gold once held in the player's monastery—the more relics are captured, the faster the gold is accumulated. Collecting all relics on the map is one <b>method</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> a player can win a random map game, depending on the victory setting. Once a player has all in their monasteries, a timer is shown to all players. If an opposing player does not destroy a monastery holding a relic after the set time, then that player wins.|$|E
5|$|In late March, the code-breakers at the Far East Combined Bureau, {{a branch}} of Bletchley Park, {{informed}} Somerville that the Japanese were planning a raid into the Indian Ocean to attack Colombo and Trincomalee and destroy his fleet. He therefore divided his fleet into two groups: Force A, which consisted of the two fleet carriers, Warspite and four cruisers, and Force B, centred on Royal Sovereign and her sisters and the carrier Hermes. He intended to ambush Nagumo's fleet in a night action, the only <b>method</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> {{he thought he could}} achieve a victory. After three days of searching for the Japanese fleet without success, Somerville returned to Addu Atoll to refuel. While refuelling his ships, Somerville received a report that the Japanese fleet was approaching Colombo, which they attacked the following day, on 5 April, followed by attacks on Trincomalee on 9 April.|$|E
5|$|Questions then arose {{among the}} U.S. {{administration}} and military leadership {{as to the}} best <b>method</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> Hanoi (the perceived locus of the insurgency) could be dissuaded from its course of action. The answer seemed to lie {{in the application of}} air power. By 1964 most of the civilians surrounding President Lyndon B. Johnson shared the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collective faith in the efficacy of strategic bombing to one degree or another. They reasoned that a small nation like North Vietnam, with a tiny industrial base that was just emerging after the First Indochina War, would be reluctant to risk its new-found economic viability to support the insurgency in the south. Constantly affecting this decision-making process were fears of possible counter moves or outright intervention by the Soviet Union, the PRC, or both. The civilians and the military were divided, however, on the manner of affecting Hanoi's will to support the southern insurgency. The civilians thought in terms of changing the regime's behavior while the military men were more concerned with breaking its will.|$|E
