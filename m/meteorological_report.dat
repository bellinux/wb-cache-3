5|$|The first {{proposals}} for an airport on Værøy were {{launched by the}} government in the late 1960s. A 1968 <b>meteorological</b> <b>report</b> concluded that the island was highly susceptible for strong winds, dominantly from the west, which could cause problems for air traffic. Three locations were considered: Kvalnes, Røssnesvågen og Nordlandet. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute concluded in 1973 that Nordlandet was the most suitable location in terms of weather, but test flights showed otherwise. Nordlandet was the cheapest alternative. Estimates showed that the regularity at an airport would be significantly lower than at the existing heliport. This caused local politicians to wish to keep the existing service, but pressure from Røst caused Værøy politicians to support an airport. After initial protests against Nordlandet as a site, Mayor Asmund Berg accepted the location on 3 May 1984. There had not been conducted sufficient test flights to establish the wind conditions above the airport caused by Teisthammeren, a mountain next to the airport. Widerøe was opposed to the location of the airport.|$|E

It is possible that an alternative course was being considered. At 21:35 R101 crossed the English coast near Hastings and at 21:40 transmitted a progress report back to Cardington, mentioning that recovery of rainwater into the ballast tanks was taking place but again not reporting the engine problem.

5000|$|The {{conditions}} at Santos Dumont Airport had deteriorated {{since the last}} <b>meteorological</b> <b>report</b> the pilots had received. The ceiling was 300 ft below the safe ceiling for a circle-to-land approach, but allowed an approach using the ECHO 1 route. Despite informing air traffic control that they would use the ECHO 1 approach to Runway 35, the aircraft was {{far to the right}} of the ECHO 1 approach. After reviewing other approaches the captain had made using the flight management system on visual approaches, the investigators hypothesized that the captain was using a visual approach, aided by the FMS, with the intention of joining the ECHO 1 trajectory on final approach. The report notes that the captain used a similar approach in previous landings and that [...] "it is possible that the captain’s experience of landing in runways of other countries with precarious infrastructure conditions, in addition to his mistaken assumption of the real meteorological conditions in the aerodrome, may have contributed to his feeling safe upon adopting such procedure." [...] However, such an approach, which saved five minutes, was not permissible in the meteorological {{conditions at}} the time of the crash, when aircraft could only use instrument only (IFR) approaches.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the collection, checking and homogenisation of a Canadian atmospheric surface pressure database. The {{object of the}} exercise {{was to create a}} database of monthly mean surface pressure for as many stations as possible across Canada as far back in time as possible. Data sources included the World Weather Records, Monthly Climatic Data for the World Bulletins, the Global Historical Climate Network and the electronic <b>meteorological</b> <b>report</b> archives of Environment Canada. Much of the earlier data was in paper form and had to be digitized by hand. Over 66, 000 individual mean monthly pressure values were obtained, with a missing value rate of 5. 9 %. The homogenisation procedures used were the Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (SNHT; Alexandersson and Moberg 1997) and Multiple Comparison Analysis (MCA; as used by Slonosky et al 1999). In addition, simple subtraction of sea-level pressure from station-level pressure revealed a major inhomogeneity which took place in 1977, when computer generated pressure reduction tables were used for the first time by the Meteorological Service of Canada, and when the meteorological reporting procedure was brought into alignment with the World Meteorological Organisation’s guidelines. As a result, the final homogenised database shows appreciable differences in trends compared to the unhomogenised series. The final database has been used by Slonosky & Graham (2003) in the statistical analysis of trends and variability of surface pressure across Canada during the 20 th century.

The soils of the study sites (Babile and Fedis) were sandy loam and silty clay loam, respectively. Fedis site receives a mean annual rainfall of 714.3  mm (Ethiopia <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Report,</b> unpublished), with a mean maximum and minimum temperature of 27.8 and 8.8  °C, respectively. The area has a bi-modal pattern, falling in two seasons, with the short rain season occurring between March and May and the long rain season from between June through October. At Babile site, the annual means maximum and minimum temperatures are 20 and 90  °C, respectively with annual mean rainfall of 540  mm which has been calculated based on the weather data between 2000 and 2014. The soil of Babile site before planting the experiment showed the following properties: pH 6.66; EC, 0.04  dS m− 1; organic carbon content, 0.56 %; total N, 0.06 % available P content (Olsen), 2.22  mg kg− 1; contents of exchangeable K 1 +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and Na 1 +, 0.34, 4.18, 3.5 and 0.15 cmol(+) kg− 1, respectively; cation exchange capacity, 8.17 cmol(+) kg− 1, number of rhizobia, 5.8  ×  102 cells g−l of dry soil.

40|$|This ornithological report {{covering}} the years 1982 and 1983 follows on {{from a series}} begun in 1950. lt deals mainly {{with the results of}} the long-term monitoring of several bird communities in the Camargue and lists a few species which are accidentai in the area. The baseline for inclusion of unusual observations is provided by the Guide des Oiseaux de Camargue (Blondel et Isenmann, 1981) which gives the status and phenology of the 337 species recorded in the Camargue, the Crau and the Alpilles. Now that a rare birds committee has been established in France only those observations accepted by this committee will in future be published here. The present report, however, was written before the committee had given a verdict on sorne of the observations submitted. The <b>meteorological</b> <b>report</b> shows that 1982 was a dry year with a mild winter and a hot summer. The autumn was mild and characterised by a freak storm from the S. E. on the 7 - 8 November 1983 was also a dry year; the spring was dominated by frequent and strong S. E. winds and the summer was hot. Cormorants have been censused for the 3 rd and 4 th consecutive winters and their numbers have peaked at between 4 000 and 6 000 (Fig. 1). The recent increase in numbers can perhaps be related to the increase of the breeding populations of Denmark and Rolland, since ringed birds from Rolland have been sighted in the Camargue. Reed-nesting herons are censuse d annually by aerial photography over the major part of the south coast of Franoe. The Grey heron continues to increase in number and to extend its range (Table l). Purple heron numbers have increased since 1981, but unlike the Grey, the major colonies of this species are not situated within the Camargue proper but to the East and West of the two main arms of the river. Tree-nesting herons have also been censused annually since 1968. Their numbers are given in Table II, from which {{it can be seen that}} the Cattle egret population has practically stopped increasing and now fluctuates at around 400 pairs. Both Little and Cattle egrets have also been censused at the winter roosts (Table III). Breeding Bitterns we re also censused and 5 4 « boom ing) males were located in the greater Camargue area in 1983; the number found in the Camargue proper (24) being the same as in 1982. Both years produced record numbers of flamingos breeding in the delta : 10500 pairs raised 6825 chicks in 1982 and 14400 pairs raised 7200 chicks in 1983, the latter being the only colony established throughout the western Mediterranean. The ringing programme started in 1977 was continued and 652 and 720 chicks respectively were marked the two years. These birds are individually recogniseable in the field and there have now been over 19000 contacts from a total of 4688 colour-ringed flamingos (56 % of the sample). Sightings are from the Western Mediterranean in particular, but with a few birds in Senegal, Mauritania and Libya. Following the strong S. E. winds of early November 1982, small groups of flamingos were sighted well inland in France. One ringed bird is known to have returned to the Camargue after being seen on the River Isère (Drôme), 185 km up the Rhône valley. In spite of the large numbers of flamingos in the Camargue these two springs the problem of these birds feeding in the rice-paddies has not worsened. On the contrary, the scaring campaings have paid off and no subsequent damage was reported by the farmers (even though the area under rice cultivation has increased). The wintering Bewick's Swan population peaked at 55 - 60 in 1981 - 82 and 68 in 1982 - 83, rather lower than the peaks of 85 and 82 individuals recorded in the past. Over the past six years the number of Shelducks recorded along the south coast of France prior to breeding has been around 1400 individuals. About 500 pairs breed in the area, mainly in the salines of the Camargue and Petite Camargue. The colour-ringing programme was continued and a further 69 birds were marked, bringing the total of individually recogniseable Shelducks ringed since 1978 to 316. Sightings of these birds on the « Grosser Knechtsand » have shown that birds from the south of France join the vast majority of birds from North Western Europe for the annual moult in the German Waddenzee (see Table IV). Following the cold spell in N. Europe in winter 1981 - 82, a record number of 2060 Shelducks were counted in S. France, most of these (1876) being in the Camargue and Petite Camargue. Results of the monthly winter censuses of other Anatidae species, carried out by the C. N. R. S. since 1964 - 65, are summarised in Table V and VI, prepared and commented upon by A. Tamisier. During the winter of 1982 - 83 total duck numbers peaked at only 100000. This is lower than usual and may be attributed to two factors mainly : the S. E. storm of early November and the gradual loss of good habitat (disturbance by hunting and fishing has increased). In order to emphasize the importance of disturbance-free areas the numbers of ducks recorded on the St Seren marsh located in the centre of the Tour du Valat Reserve are given in Table VII. Regarding the larger raptors there has been no change in the status of the Egyptian vulture and Eagle owl in the Alpilles, but the two pairs of Bonelli's eagles have had very poor breeding seasons with only 2 young raised in two years. In the Camargue there has been no detectable change in the Marsh harrier population, an estimated 84 occupied nest sites being located in 1982. In the Crau the winte ring population of Little bustards has remained relatively stable over the past ten years at around 1000 individuals (max. 1283 in Dec. 1982. Amongst the waders on passage unusually high numbers of Marsh sandpipers, up to 15 - 16 together, have been recorde deach autumn. a Terek sandpiper was shot locally in Sept. 1983 and there are two further May records of Wilson's phalarope, a species now observed almost annually. The 1982 census of breeding laro-limicolae revealed 26 pairs of Slenderbilled gulls but these failed to raise any chicks. In 1983, however, a similar number of pairs raised 60 young, by far the most successful season on record for this species. Mediterranean gulls also had two good seasons with a record 13 pairs in 1982 and 14 young raised in 1983 by 5 - 6 pairs (incomplete census). Whiskered terns, on the other hand, did not breed in 1982 and failed in their attempt in 1983 (200 + pairs). Amongst the passerines a Desert wheatear was recorded in the Crau in February 1983. This bird, the second recorded from the Crau in 3 years, has been accepted by the rareties committee. Finally, an event which has either been overlooked in the past or is a new development, is the importance of a Carrion crow roost near Le Sambuc where 950 were recorded in December 198...|$|E
