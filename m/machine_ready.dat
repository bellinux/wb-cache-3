50|$|SIPROS {{turned out}} to be a major fiasco. Development {{timelines}} continued to slip, costing CDC major amounts of profit in the form of delivery delay penalties. After several months of waiting with the <b>machines</b> <b>ready</b> to be shipped, the project was eventually cancelled. The programmers who had worked on COS had little faith in SIPROS and had continued working on improving COS.|$|R

6000|$|... "Now, Drummond," [...] he said, [...] "we will shake hands, {{and begin}} to make each other's acquaintance. First, I am Nigel Lindsay, very much at your service. On duty I am another person altogether, {{scarcely}} recognizable even by myself--a sort of wooden <b>machine,</b> <b>ready,</b> when a button is touched, to bring my heels smartly together, and my hand to the salute. There is {{something in the air}} that stiffens one's backbone, and freezes one from the tip of one's toes to the end of one's pigtail. When one is with the marshal alone, one thaws; for there is no better fellow living, and he chats to us as if we were on a mountain side in Scotland, instead of in Frederick's palace. But one is always being interrupted; either a general, or a colonel, or possibly the king himself, comes in.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have been}} keeping Lindsay waiting. When he had nothing special to do, he sat indifferently in his chair, {{with the face of}} a precentor after the sermon has begun. But though it was not very likely that Lindsay would pay much {{attention}} to talk about such playthings as the laws of nature, his fingers went out {{in the direction of the}} professor when the experiments began. Then he was not the precentor; he was a minister in one of the pews. Lindsay was an inscrutable man, and I shall not dare to say that he even half-wished to see Tait fail. He only looked on, ready for any emergency; but if the experiment would not come off, he was as quick to go to the professor's assistance as a member of Parliament is to begin when he has caught the Speaker's eye. Perhaps Tait would have none of his aid, or pushed the mechanism for the experiment from him--an intimation to Lindsay to carry it quickly to the ante-room. Do you think Lindsay read the instructions so? Let me tell you that your mind fails to seize hold of Lindsay. He marched the machine out of Tait's vicinity as a mother may push her erring boy away from his father's arms, to take him to her heart as soon as the door is closed. Lindsay took the machine to his seat, and laid it before him on the desk, with well-concealed apathy. Tait would flash his eye to the right to see what Lindsay was after, and there was Lindsay sitting with his arms folded. The professor's lecture resumed its way, and then out went Lindsay's hands to the machine. Here he tried a wheel; again he turned a screw; in time he had the <b>machine</b> <b>ready</b> for another trial. No one was looking his way, when suddenly there was a whizz--bang, bang. All eyes were turned upon Lindsay, the professor's among them. A cheer broke out as we realized that Lindsay had done the experiment. Was he flushed with triumph? Not a bit of it; he was again sitting with his arms folded. A Glasgow merchant of modest manners, when cross-examined in a law court, stated that he had a considerable monetary interest in a certain concern. [...] "How much do you mean by a 'considerable monetary interest'?" [...] demanded the contemptuous barrister who was cross-examining him. [...] "Oh," [...] said the witness, humbly, [...] "a maiter o' a million an' a half--or, say, twa million." [...] That Glasgow man in the witness-box is the only person I can think of, when looking about me for a parallel to Lindsay. While the professor eyed him and the students deliriously beat the floor, Lindsay quietly gathered the mechanism together and carried it to the ante-room. His head was not flung back nor his chest forward, like one who walked to music. In his hour of triumph he was still imperturbable. I lie back in my chair to-day, after the lapse of years, and ask myself again, How did Lindsay behave after he entered the ante-room, shutting the door behind him? Did he give way? There is no one to say. When he returned to the class-room he wore his familiar face; a man to ponder over.|$|E

50|$|In April 1906 {{a former}} boot factory in Erskineville was leased by the Ministry of Public Instruction, {{to be used}} for a bootmaking {{training}} school. Formerly the factory of Mr FJ Walters and his Anchor Shoe Brand, the two-storey brick factory came with a gas engine and shafting <b>machines</b> <b>ready</b> for use. Mr H Lewis was appointed as the instructor and although classes began, there was no complete fit-out of machinery, so tuition was restricted to clinking (cutting the leather for uppers) and basic instruction. While the school awaited machinery, students were given access to machines in the York Street showrooms of the Singer Sewing Machine Company.|$|R
50|$|The {{design for}} this <b>machine</b> was <b>ready</b> in 1976. Basically it {{consists}} of two EU07 locomotives but with two driver's cabs removed. Two locos are semi-permanently coupled in multiple operation. Because of this, the current collection must be done independently for each section.|$|R
50|$|As chance {{would have}} it, Levy had {{recently}} been fired by ITT and was hired by Turnbull. He set up the small in-house Electronics Laboratory {{with the promise of}} having a prototype <b>machine</b> <b>ready</b> for testing in three years. In early 1953 he visited companies looking for potential development partners, and through this process he met with Arther Porter, head of R&D at Ferranti Canada.|$|E
50|$|Fully {{fashioned}} {{knitting machines}} are those flat and {{circular knitting machines}} that produce custom pre-shaped pieces of a knitted garment. Instead of knitting a whole rectangular sheet of fabric, instructions from a knit pattern on a punch card or computer file guide a fully fashioned knitting machine's needles to add or drop stitches to create custom two-dimensional shapes appropriate to the desired finished garment structure. The pieces emerge from the <b>machine</b> <b>ready</b> to be sewn together.|$|E
5000|$|More You Becomes You {{featured}} mournful pianos, sweeping arrangements, plaintive emotional confessionals, {{and delicate}} vocal harmonies. The electric arrangements of his debut single, [...] "Found a Little Baby", were abandoned {{in favor of}} simple piano arrangements. The album was mainly centered on Hayes installed at his piano with a tape <b>machine</b> <b>ready</b> to record. It featured a raw simplicity with Hayes giggling mischievously as he missed the high notes of a delicate [...] "(I Didn't Know) I Was Asleep".|$|E
50|$|The list of {{participants}} in the ISDT/ISDE (International Six Days Enduro) since the beginning event in 1913 that saw US citizens as contestants is divided into four segments; Ambassadors, Trailblazer, Pioneers and Qualified/Selected Participants 1971 and beyond. Ambassadors are those hardy men and women who competed in ISDT/ISDE at least 10 times in their career. Trailblazer is but one man on a very early moto-cycle. This typical trailblazer was only looking for what was over the next hill and what challenges he and his machine could conquer. Pioneers were on more modern motorcycles and got themselves and their <b>machines</b> <b>ready</b> for the challenges long before USA had an official affiliation with the FIM. Qualified/Selected riders are 1971 and later participants who rode in AMA qualifiers or were appointed by the AMA based on prior performances.|$|R
5000|$|The Colombian mafias and {{especially}} the Medellín Cartel imposed a modality of crime with the hired killers ("sicarios" [...] in Spanish) to murder political opponents or any authority that could put in danger their dirty business. What became astonishing was that the mafias were contracting teenagers from the slums of the big cities. Boys from marginalized barrios (and many cases also girls), became killing <b>machines</b> <b>ready</b> to murder for {{the service of the}} mafias. Pablo Escobar, {{in the middle of his}} war against the Colombian authorities in the 1990s, offered three to five million pesos (about USD 5,280 y 8,800 of 1990 currency) to anybody who would kill an official of the Police. About 300 policemen were killed in Medellín by sicarios willing to get paid by the mafias.|$|R

5000|$|Mauchly {{persuaded the}} United States Census Bureau to order an [...] "EDVAC II" [...] {{computer}} {{a model that}} was soon renamed UNIVAC receiving a contract in 1948 that called for having the <b>machine</b> <b>ready</b> for the 1950 census. Eckert hired a staff that included {{a number of the}} engineers from the Moore School, and the company launched an ambitious program to design and manufacture large-scale computing machines. A major achievement was the use of magnetic tape for high-speed storage. During development Mauchly continued to solicit new customers and started a software department. They developed applications, starting with the world's first compiler for the language Short Code.|$|E
5000|$|Otto Frederick Rohwedder of Davenport, Iowa, United States, {{invented the}} first loaf-at-a-time bread-slicing machine. A {{prototype}} he built in 1912 {{was destroyed in}} a fire {{and it was not}} until 1928 that Rohwedder had a fully working <b>machine</b> <b>ready.</b> The first commercial use of the machine was by the Chillicothe Baking Company of Chillicothe, Missouri, which sold their first slices on July 7, 1928. Their product, [...] "Kleen Maid Sliced Bread", proved a success. Battle Creek, Michigan, has a competing claim as the first city to sell bread sliced by Rohwedder's machine; however, historians have produced no documentation backing up Battle Creek's claim. The bread was advertised as [...] "the greatest forward step in the baking industry since bread was wrapped." ...|$|E
50|$|The Apple IIc, {{the fourth}} {{model in the}} Apple II series of {{personal}} computers, is Apple Computer’s first endeavor to produce a portable computer. The result was a 7.5 lb notebook-sized version of the Apple II that could be transported from place to place. The c in the name stood for compact, referring to the fact it was essentially a complete Apple II computer setup (minus display and power supply) squeezed into a small notebook-sized housing. While sporting a built-in floppy drive and new rear peripheral expansion ports integrated onto the main logic board, it lacks the internal expansion slots and direct motherboard access of earlier Apple IIs, making it a closed system like the Macintosh. However, that was the intended direction for this model — a more appliance-like <b>machine,</b> <b>ready</b> to use out of the box, requiring no technical know-how or experience to hook up and therefore attractive to first-time users.|$|E
50|$|A virtual {{appliance}} is a pre-configured virtual <b>machine</b> image, <b>ready</b> {{to run on}} a hypervisor; {{virtual appliance}}s are {{a subset of the}} broader class of software appliances. Installation of a software appliance on a virtual machine and packaging that into an image creates a virtual appliance. Like software appliances, virtual appliances are intended to eliminate the installation, configuration and maintenance costs associated with running complex stacks of software.|$|R

40|$|Dynamic mapping (matching and scheduling) {{heuristics}} for a {{class of}} independent tasks using heterogeneous dis- tributed computing systems are studied. Two types of map- ping heuristics are considered: on-line and batch mode heuristics. Three new heuristics, one for batch and two for on-line, are introduced {{as part of this}} research. Simula- tion studies are performed to compare these heuristics with some existing ones. In total, five on-line heuristics and three batch heuristics are examined. The on-line heuristics con- sider, to varying degrees and in different ways, task affinity for different machines and <b>machine</b> <b>ready</b> times. The batch heuristics consider these factors, as well as aging of tasks waiting to execute. The simulation results reveal that the choice of mapping heuristic depends on parameters such as: (a) the structure of the heterogeneity among tasks and machines, (b) the optimization requirements, and (c) the ar- rival rate of the tasks...|$|E
30|$|Analysing the usages of {{attributes}} {{included in}} the evolved scheduling heuristics has also {{been done in the}} literature to understand the contributions of these attributes. For example, Nguyen et al. [89] analyses the frequency usage of attributes in the final dispatching rules evolved by GP to show what are the most useful attributes. Branke et al. [18] analysed the importance of each attribute by measuring the performance of the best rules when certain attributes are not available. Their analyses show that some attributes are more important for specific representations. Instead of independently investigating each attribute, Hunt et al. [55] performed fragment analyses to show the most common fragments (with the depth of two) in the evolved scheduling heuristics. The analyses show that some fragments representing the differences between due date, <b>machine</b> <b>ready</b> time, and current time appear most often in the evolved heuristics. The analyses also showed that most frequent fragments from different GP techniques can be different.|$|E

40|$|Different {{companies}} {{sharing the}} same cloud infrastructure often prefer to run their virtual machines (VMs) in isolation, i. e., one VM per physical machine (PM) core, due to security and efficiency concerns. To accommodate load spikes, e. g., those caused by flash-crowds, each service is allocated more machines than necessary for its instantaneous load. However, flash-crowds of different hosted services are not correlated, so at any given time, only {{a subset of the}} machines are used. We present here the concept of preallocation — having a single physical <b>machine</b> <b>ready</b> to quickly run one of a few possible VMs, without ever running more than one at a given time. The preallocated VMs are initialized and then paused by the hypervisor. We suggest a greedy preallocation strategy, and evaluate it by simulation, using workloads based on previous analyses of flash-crowds. We observe a reduction of 35 - 50 % in number of PMs used compared with classical dynamic allocation. This means that a datacenter can provide per-service isolation with 35 %- 50 % fewer PMs. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a new selective dynamic compilation technique targeting ARM 16 / 32 -bit embedded system processors. This compiler is built inside the J 2 ME/CLDC (Java 2 Micro Edition for Connected Limited Device Configuration) platform [Sun MicroSystems, Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition, Version 1. 0 Connected, Limited Device Configuration, Specification, Technical Report, Sun Microsystems, CA, USA, May 2000]. The primary {{objective of this}} work is to elaborate an efficient, lightweight and low-footprint accelerated Java virtual <b>machine</b> <b>ready</b> to be executed on embedded machines. This is achieved by implementing a selective ARM dynamic compiler called Armed E-Bunny into Sun’s Kilobyte Virtual Machine (KVM) [Sun MicroSystems, KVM porting guide, Technical Report, Sun MicroSystems, CA, USA, September 2001]. In this paper we present the motivations, the architecture, the design and the implementation of Armed E-Bunny. The modified KVM is ported on a handheld PDA that is powered with embedded Linux and is tested using standard J 2 ME benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that a speed-up of 360 % over the last version of Sun’s KVM is accomplished with a footprint that does not exceed 119  KB. An important result {{of this paper is}} also the proposition of an acceleration technique that leverages Armed E-Bunny by establishing a synergy between efficient interpretation and selective dynamic compilation. The main traits of this technique are: a one-pass compilation by code reuse, an efficient threaded interpretation and a fast switching mechanism between the interpreted and compiled modes...|$|E
40|$|In an offset {{printing}} machine the rollers (ink unit) and the cylinders (printing unit) are in contact {{in a lot}} of places. The contact surfaces comprise a metal surface and a rubber surface. As appears from findings based on the professional literature and experience of people working in printing houses the issue of contact between ink rollers and printing cylinders in an {{offset printing}} machine is of great importance. It has impact on the quality of printouts (generation of printouts errors), consumption of energy, time of making the printing <b>machine</b> <b>ready</b> for operation, wear of the machine’s components and related consumables like ink, dampening solution, paper, ink rollers, plate. During the theoretical studies, the equations were derived to show how the rollers compression depends on the contact area width and clamping force. The equations involve Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of rollers ’ materials. The difference between these equations and the so far existing equations has resulted from changing the place of applying the clamping force and involving Poisson’s ratio. The paper includes the comparison of the aforesaid new equations and those known from the literature. Moreover, the relation-ship in between the contact area width and the compression of metal roller and rubber-covered roller was subject to experimental at-tempts aimed at verification of the equation presented. In order to measure the rollers compression a clock sensor was used, and for measurement of the contact area width – a device called Roller Nip Control. The results of these measurements are presented in this paper and are compared with the results obtained from the equation derived in the course of theoretical studies using the analytical method...|$|E
