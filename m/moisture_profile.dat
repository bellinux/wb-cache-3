The updraft tower is typically more strongly tilted and the deviant rightward motion lesser than for other supercell types. The forward flank downdraft (FFD) is noticeably weaker than for other supercell types and the rear-flank downdraft (RFD) is much weaker—even visually absent in many cases. Like classic supercells, LP supercells tend to form within stronger mid-to-upper level storm-relative wind shear, however, the atmospheric environment leading to their formation is not well understood.

In this study, a physically based algorithm has been developed to retrieve a hyperspectral IR emissivity spectrum simultaneously with the temperature and <b>moisture</b> <b>profiles,</b> {{as well as the}} surface skin temperature. To make the solution stable and efficient, the hyperspectral emissivity spectrum is represented by eigenvectors, derived from the laboratory measured hyperspectral emissivity database, in the retrieval process.

A simplified Kalman filter covariance forecasting methodology is developed based on forecasting of the state correlations and imposed state variances. This covariance forecasting technique, termed the modified Kalman filter, was then used in a 1 month three-dimensional field application. Two updating scenarios were tested: (1) updating every 2 to 3 days and (2) a single update. The data used were from the Nerrigundah field site, near Newcastle, Australia. This study demonstrates the feasibility of data assimilation in a quasi three-dimensional distributed soil moisture model, provided simplified covariance forecasting techniques are used. It also identifies that (1) the soil <b>moisture</b> <b>profile</b> cannot be retrieved from near-surface soil moisture measurements when the near-surface and deep soil layers become decoupled, such as during extreme drying events; (2) if simulation of the soil <b>moisture</b> <b>profile</b> is already good, the assimilation {{can result in a}} slight degradation, but if the simulation is poor, assimilation can yield a significant improvement; (3) soil <b>moisture</b> <b>profile</b> retrieval results are independent of initial conditions; and (4) the required update frequency {{is a function of the}} errors in model physics and forcing data...|$|E

40|$|The {{root zone}} soil {{moisture}} has been long recognized as important information for hydrological, meteorological and agricultural research. In this study, we propose a closed-loop data assimilation procedure {{to update the}} vertical soil <b>moisture</b> <b>profile</b> from time-lapse ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data. The hydrodynamic model, Hydrus- 1 D (Simunek et al., 2009), is used to propagate the system state in time and a radar electromagnetic model (Lambot et al., 2004) to link the state variable (soil <b>moisture</b> <b>profile)</b> with the observation data (GPR data), which enables us to update the soil <b>moisture</b> <b>profile</b> by directly assimilating the GPR data. The assimilation was performed within the maximum likelihood ensemble filter (MLEF) framework developed by Zupanski et al., (2005), for which the problem of nonlinear observation operator is solved much more effectively than the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) techniques. The method estimates the optimal state as the maximum of the probability density function (PDF) instead of the minimum variance like {{in most of the}} other ensemble data assimilation methods. Direct assimilation of GPR data is a prominent advantage of our approach. It avoids solving the timeconsuming inverse problem as well as the estimation errors of the soil moisture caused by inversion. In addition, instead of using only surface soil moisture, the approach allows to use the information of the whole soil <b>moisture</b> <b>profile,</b> which is reflected via the ultra wideband (UWB) GPR data, for the assimilation. The use of the UWB antenna in this study is also an advantage as it provides more information about soil <b>moisture</b> <b>profile</b> with a better depth resolution compared to other classical remote sensing techniques. Our approach was validated by a synthetic study. We constructed a synthetic soil column with a depth of 80 cm and analyzed the effects of the soil type on the data assimilation by considering 3 soil types, namely, loamy sand, silt and clay. The assimilation of GPR data was performed {{to solve the problem of}} unknown initial conditions. We simulated a zero-offset antenna operating in the frequency domain in the range of 1 - 3 GHz with a frequency step of 6 MHz. The distance between the antenna and soil surface was 37 cm. The numerical soil moisture profiles generated by the Hydrus- 1 D model were used by the GPR model to produce the "observed" GPR data. The results show that the soil <b>moisture</b> <b>profile</b> obtained by assimilating the GPR data is much better than that of an open-loop forecast. Compared to the loamy sand and silt, the updated soil <b>moisture</b> <b>profile</b> of the clay soil converges to the true state much more slowly. Increasing update interval from 5 to 50 hours only slightly improves the effectiveness of the GPR data assimilation for the loamy sand but significantly for the clay soil.

Although there have been intensive studies on applications of GPR for soil moisture estimation, significant efforts are still needed to improve its accuracy. In addition, in many applications, knowledge of the soil <b>moisture</b> <b>profile</b> is essential, which has remained a major challenge for many years. For increasing the accuracy of soil moisture estimation, we improved the GPR modeling and petrophysical relationships. For the GPR model, we further developed the near-field antenna model introduced by Lambot and Andre (2013). We successfully calibrated and validated the model using both numerical and laboratory experiments. Then, we improved the petrophysical relationship by coupling full-wave GPR inversion, dielectric mixing model and Debye's equation {{to account for the}} frequency dependence of electric properties and directly estimate soil moisture. For estimating the soil hydraulic properties and <b>moisture</b> <b>profile,</b> the GPR model was integrated into the hydrodynamic model in an assimilation framework.

40|$|Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has {{recently}} become a powerful geophysical technique to characterize soil moisture {{at the field}} scale. Compared to the airborne/spaceborne remote sensing techniques, GPR can provide soil moisture data with a much higher spatial resolution (around 0. 1 - 1 m). Its characterization depth is also larger {{for the fact that}} GPR works near the soil surface. We developed a data assimilation scheme to simultaneously estimate the vertical soil <b>moisture</b> <b>profile</b> and hydraulic parameters from time-lapse GPR measurements. The assimilation scheme includes a soil hydrodynamic model to simulate the soil moisture dynamics, a full-wave electromagnetic wave propagation model and petrophysical relationship to link the state variable with the GPR data, and a maximum likelihood ensemble assimilation algorithm. The hydraulic parameters are estimated jointly with the soil moisture using a state augmentation technique. The approach allows for the direct assimilation of GPR data, thus maximizing the use of the information. The proposed approach was validated by numerical experiments assuming wrong initial conditions and hydraulic parameters. We compared three scenarios: open-loop (without assimilation), surface soil moisture assimilation and GPR assimilation. The synthetic soil moisture profiles were generated by the Hydrus- 1 D model, which then were used by the electromagnetic model and petrophysical Relationship to create "observed" GPR data. The results show that the data assimilation significantly improves the accuracy of the hydrodynamic model prediction. Compared with the surface soil moisture assimilation, the GPR data assimilation better corrects the soil <b>moisture</b> <b>profile</b> and hydraulic parameters. The results also show that the estimated soil <b>moisture</b> <b>profile</b> in the coarse soil converges to the "true" state more rapidly than in the fine one.
