40|$|Often times {{electricity}} {{charges are}} {{based solely on}} a per kilowatt-hour (kWh) basis, ignoring the fact {{that much of the}} cost associated with electricity service is fixed. From this basis, cross-subsidies have been implemented to achieve various social objectives such as affordable rates for the economically disadvantaged or extension of service to previously unserved areas. However, {{it is well known that}} regardless of whether rates have embedded cross-subsidies, this “average cost pricing ” of power is not economically efficient. This paper proposes a method of cross-subsidies that uses as its basis optimal multi-part pricing that accounts for the fixed nature of costs associated with electricity provision. The method of cross-subsidy is straightforward and relies on well-understood results from welfare economics that advocates lump-sum transfers over per-unit transfers. In the case of electricity rates, lump-sum transfers through the fixed charge portion of the <b>multi-part</b> <b>tariff</b> are used to implement cross-subsidies across customer classes without distorting consumption decisions and are efficiency enhancing. While the result is relatively straightforward, implementation of such a scheme will require deeper consideration including demand estimation, cost-of-service studies and cost reflectivity, choice of regulatory mechanisms, the avoidance of uneconomic bypass, and the appropriateness of such a scheme to different customer base and industry structures...|$|E

40|$|A {{new theory}} of limit pricing is {{provided}} which works through the vertical contract signed between an incumbent manufacturer and a retailer. We establish {{conditions under which}} the incumbent can obtain full monopoly profits, even if the potential entrant is more efficient. A key feature of the optimal vertical contract we describe is quantity discounting, typically involving three-part incremental-units or all-units tariffs, with a marginal wholesale price that is below the incumbent’s marginal cost for sufficiently large quantities. limit pricing, vertical contracts, <b>multi-part</b> <b>tariffs.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} competition in experimental posted-offer markets where sellers can confuse buyers. I report two studies. In one, the sellers offering heterogeneous goods can obfuscate buyers by means of spurious product differentiation. In the other study, sellers offer identical goods and make their prices unnecessarily complex by having <b>multi-part</b> <b>tariffs.</b> I vary the level of competition by having treatments with two and three- sellers in both studies, and having an additional treatment with five-sellers in one study. The results show that average complexity created by a seller is not different for the treatments with two, three and five sellers. In addition, market prices are highest and buyer surplus is lowest when there are two sellers in a market...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{tractable}} model of competition between an arbitrary number of interconnected communications {{networks in the}} presence of tariff-mediated network externalities, call externalities, and cost and market share asymmetries. On the theory side, we provide a criterion for stability in expectations and determine equilibrium outcomes in linear and two-part tariffs. As applications, we reconsider mobile termination for calls from the fixed network (FTM), and between mobile networks (MTM). We show that there is a partial FTM waterbed effect under linear tariffs, and that with more than two networks some known duopoly results are reversed: Under <b>multi-part</b> <b>tariffs,</b> consumer surplus may decrease (rather than increase), and under linear tariffs both on- and off-net prices may increase with higher MTM termination charges. call externality; mobile termination rates; multiple networks; on/off-net pricing; Telecommunications network competition; waterbed effect...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} panel data approach This paper uses {{monthly data}} from eleven {{local governments to}} model residential water demand in Queensland, Australia from 1994 to 2004. In the sample, residential consumption is charged {{using a variety of}} structures including fixed charges without allowance, fixed charges with allowance and excess rates, two-part tariffs comprising an access charge and a flat consumption rate and <b>multi-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> with an access charge and two or more limits with increasing consumption rates. Water demand is specified as average monthly household water consumption and the demand characteristics include the marginal and average price of water and daily average maximum temperatures and rainfall. The findings confirm residential water as price inelastic, more responsive to average than marginal prices, and more responsive to changes in temperature than rainfall. The results also suggest that cross-sectional variation in demand is related to local government-specific factors...|$|R

40|$|A {{residential}} {{water demand}} equation is estimated using a panel data sample of 5 Portuguese local communities and 72 months, corresponding {{to a total}} number of 360 observations. Because {{of the presence of}} <b>multi-part</b> <b>tariffs,</b> we use as explanatory variables the two common price-related variables: marginal price and difference. To prevent the simultaneity bias from using observed quantities to determine the values of marginal price and difference directly from the rate schedule, we use an instrumental variable approach to create a constant marginal price and difference parameters for each rate structure. The price elasticity value obtained fall within the range of those found in other case studies. Thus, although presenting weak elasticity, price seems {{to play a role in}} water demand management. However, we do not confirm the expected influence of difference on residential water demand. This can be a consequence of the complexity of the Portuguese water tariffs and the confusing signs that come from the simultaneous use of fixed quotas and increasing block tariffs. So, it is imperative to clarify water tariffs objectives by reviewing the Portuguese water tariffs design processes. demand, water utilities, pricing policy. ...|$|R
