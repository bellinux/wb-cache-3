INTERVENTIONS Mongrel dogs (20) were instrumented for hemodynamic monitoring. The esophageal doppler probe {{was placed in the}} distal esophagus of each animal. Electromechanical dissociation (EMD) was induced by clamping the endotracheal tube. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A period of pseudo-EMD was defined as the time where cardiac contractility was present, measured by a <b>micromanometer</b> tipped thoracic aortic catheter, without concurrent femoral pulses by palpation. The pseudo-EMD period could be produced consistently in all 20 animals. The characteristic doppler flow sounds were easily heard using the esophageal device in all animals. The time from endotracheal tube clamping until loss of femoral pulses was 622 +/- 96 s; until loss of radial artery doppler signals was 616 +/- 92 s; until loss of esophageal doppler signals was 728 +/- 88 s; and until loss of aortic fluctuations by thoracic aortic catheter was 728 +/- 82 s. The times to loss of esophageal doppler sounds and loss of aortic fluctuations were not significantly different. However, they were significantly longer than the time to loss of femoral pulses (P < 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS The canine asphyxial EMD model can be used for short experimental studies of pseudo-EMD. Pseudo-EMD can be consistently and non-invasively detected with this esophageal doppler device. The device is as reliable as a <b>micromanometer</b> tipped aortic arch catheter in detecting pseudo-EMD.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{establish}} the relationship between invasive measures of diastolic function and untwisting parameters measured with speckle tracking imaging. BackgroundLeft ventricular (LV) diastolic function is determined by early diastolic relaxation (which creates suction gradients for LV filling) and myocardial stiffness. Assessment of LV torsion has shown that untwisting begins before aortic valve closure and, in animals, might be {{an important component of}} normal diastolic filling. Studies in human subjects using indirect indexes derived from right heart catheterization have suggested a relationship between τ and measures of untwisting, but the relationship between directly measured diastolic function indexes with <b>micromanometer</b> catheters and untwisting parameters has not been established in human subjects. MethodsSimultaneous Millar <b>micromanometer</b> LV pressure and echocardiographic assessment was performed on 18 patients (10 male, mean age 66 years) with normal systolic function and a spectrum of diastolic function. Invasive rate of the rise of LV pressure, dp/dt minimum and τ were recorded as measures of active relaxation, and the LV minimum diastolic pressure was recorded as an index of diastolic suction. The LV stiffness constant and functional chamber stiffness were estimated from hybrid pressure-volume loops. Echocardiographic speckle tracking imaging was used to quantify torsion. ResultsAs relaxation was impaired, (prolonged τ) untwisting was delayed (r = 0. 35, p < 0. 01). There were nonsignificant associations between reduced untwisting and longer values of τ and lower dp/dt minimum. Reduction in the extent of untwisting before mitral valve opening was associated with increased LV minimum diastolic pressure (r = − 0. 30, p < 0. 034). No relation was observed between the LV stiffness constant (β: r = 0. 11, p = NS) or the functional LV chamber stiffness (b: r = 0. 11, p = NS) and untwisting. ConclusionsUntwisting parameters are related to invasive indexes of LV relaxation and suction but not to LV stiffness. These data suggest that untwisting is an important component of early diastolic LV filling but not later diastolic events...|$|E

These wall vibrations, assessed by the Altered diameter, correlated well with the third heart sound (S 3) on the phonocardiogram. The peak frequency of the wall vibrations increased with increased diastolic pressure (p = 0. 004), probably reflecting an increase in myocardlal wall stiffness. In contrast, the amplitude of the vibrations varid directly with left ventricular filling rate (p = 0. 0001). Thus, S 3 seemed to be related specifically to ventricular wall vibrations during rapid filling, and the spectra of the amplitude-frequency relation shifted toward the audible range with increases in diastolic pressure, wall stiffness or filling rate.

SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients scheduled for elective coronary artery surgery. INTERVENTIONS: In 10 patients, a combined <b>micromanometer</b> transducer conductance catheter was inserted into the left ventricle for measurement of left ventricular pressures and volumes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Consecutive data were obtained during a progressive increase in left ventricular pressures and volumes obtained by leg elevation in closed chest-closed pericardium and open chest-open pericardium conditions. Pericardiotomy did not alter baseline left ventricular hemodynamics. The effects of leg elevation were different, however. In closed chest-closed pericardium conditions, stroke volume and stroke work remained unchanged, whereas these parameters increased in open chest-open pericardium conditions.

Using a catheter with two laterally mounted <b>micromanometers,</b> we examined the left ventricle in 11 patients with AS, mean age 64 ± 11 years (± SD); the mean valve area was 1. 0 ± 0. 3 cm 2. Simultaneous measurements were made in (1) the left ventricular (LV) chamber and the LV outflow tract (LVOT) and (2) the LVOT and ascending aorta (AO). No patient had anatomic evidence of a subvalvular obstruction, but large subvalvular gradients were present in all.

To {{examine the}} {{mechanism}} ofmitral flow deceleration in diastole {{and its potential}} influence on the genesis of third (53) and fourth (54) heart sounds, we simultaneously recorded left atrial and left ventricular pressures (<b>micromanometers),</b> mitral flow velocity (elec-tromagnetic catheter-tip flow velocity meter), and internal and external phonocardiograms in 25 open-chest dogs. Diastolic time intervals, transmitral pressure gradients (planimetry), maximum mitral flow velocity, and accel-eration and deceleration of flow were measured under different loading conditions. It was found that deceleration of mitral flow in early and late diastole is always caused by a negative transmitral pressure gradient. After volume loading, diastolic pressures, positive (forward) and neg-ative (backward) transmitral pressure gradients, and ac-celeration and deceleration of flow increased, and an S 3 or S 4 appeared (20 : 25 dogs). These sounds occurred during the phase of flow deceleration and could be recorded from the chest wall, inside the left ventricle, and directly from the epicardial surface of the freely exposed left ven-tricular wall. After balloon occlusion ofthe inferior vena cava (17 : 25 dogs), the opposite changes were observed and gallop sounds disappeared. The {{results indicate that the}} left ventricular pressure rise in response to filling re-verses the transmitral pressure gradient and decelerates flow.

40|$|Fourteen {{patients}} with double inlet left ventricle and nine {{patients with}} tricuspid atresia had biplane left ventricular angiography with simultaneous measurement of left ventricular pressure by <b>micromanometer.</b> Age distribution, haemodynamic function, and previous palliative operation {{were similar in}} the two groups. Left ventricular volumes were calculated frame by frame throughout the cardiac cycle by Simpson's rule. The end diastolic volume index was similar {{in the two groups}}, but the ejection fraction was significantly lower in tricuspid atresia. Left ventricular peak filling and emptying rates were also lower in tricuspid atresia, although heart rates in the two groups were similar. End diastolic shape index was significantly higher in patients with tricuspid atresia, indicating a more globular shape, and changed less during systole, suggesting differences in the mechanism of ejection between the two groups. Analysis of pressure-volume loops showed normal phase relations between pressure and volume, but systolic stroke work was reduced in tricuspid atresia and correlated with stroke volume and shape change. Left ventricular function was impaired in patients with tricuspid atresia when compared with those with double inlet left ventricle and this finding may reflect structural differences caused by the absence of one atrioventricular connection...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{influences of}} the left atrioventricular gradient (AVG) and the time constant of isovolumic relaxation (TAU) on diastolic filling parameters by radionuclide angiography (RNA) in man are unknown. Therefore, 8 atrially paced patients without coronary artery disease underwent simultaneous RNA with <b>micromanometer</b> measurements of left atrial (LA) pressure, left ventricular (LV) pressure and TAU during baseline and steady-state infusions of nitroprusside (NIP), dobutamine (DOB), and phenylephrine (PHEN). RNA was acquired in 32 frames and Fourier fitted to obtain peak filling rate (PFR) and non-normalized PFR (NNPFR). Results below are % change (Δ%) from baseline (±SD). NIP (Δ%) DOB (Δ%) PHEN (Δ%) TAU 4 ± 11 – 18 ± 7 * 11 ± 12 *LA pressure– 25 ± 13 *– 12 ± 11 * 52 ± 35 *AVG– 27 ± 18 *– 12 ± 2982 ± 63 *PFR– 8 ± 7 *– 14 ± 12 * 6 ± 11 NNPFR– 28 ± 9 *– 21 ± 19 * 29 ± 29 **p< 005 Despite an augmented active relaxation with DOB, peak filling rate decreased significantly in response to decreased LA pressure. We conclude the RNA diastolic filling indices are critically dependent on the LA component of the AVG...|$|E
40|$|The {{influences}} of pericardium on pulomanary venous flow dynamics were studied in 18 {{patients with chronic}} various cardiac diseases during open heart surgeries using transesophageal Doppler echocardiography. Pulmonary venous flow velocity(PVF), transmitral flow velocity(TMF) and left atrial dimension were measured before and after pericardiotomy. In experimental canines with acute myocardial infarction, I also measured pulmonary venous flow profile by Doppler flow probe, left atrial dimensions by ultrasonomicrometry, and left atrial and left ventricular pressures by <b>micromanometers,</b> and I examined the effect of pericardium on pulmonary venous flow dynamics. In both clinical and experimental studies, measurements from PVF were peak flow velocity in ventricular systole (S wave), that in diastole (D wave) and atrial contraction wave (A wave), and measurements from TMF were peak velocity in early filling (E wave) and that in late filling (A wave). In clinical study, PVF profile throughout a cardiac cycle did not significantly change by pericardiotomy, whereas in canines with acute myocardial infarction, peak velocity of A wave in PVF was increased and ratios of D/S and DI/SI were significantly decreased at the condition of pericardiotomy. These results suggested that in chronic cardiac diseases, the restraint effect of pericardium might be less than that in canines with acute myocardial infarction, and chronic cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation might be accompanied with increase in pericardial compliance...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} normal left ventricular wall during diastole were studied in 15 chronically instrumented, conscious dogs. Left ventricular minor and major axis diameters and equatorial wall thickness were measured with implanted pulse-transit ultrasonic dimension transducers. Left ventricular and pleural pressures were measured with high fidelity <b>micromanometers.</b> Circumferential mural stress was calculated by using an ellipsoidal shell theory; circumferential strain was calculated by using a natural strain definition. The static elastic properties of the myocardium were estimated by fitting the stress-strain values at the points of diastasis during a vena caval occlusion to an exponential function. A modified creep {{test was used to}} evaluate the series viscous properties of the myocardium. Acute increases in systolic and diastolic loading were produced by inflating implanted aortic occluders for 15 minutes in five dogs. In these dogs, the static stress-strain curves were not altered significantly after this period of pressure loading, indicating tbat short-term series viscous properties are negligible. Parallel viscous properties were evaluated in 10 dogs by means of the variable rate stretch test of dynamic diastolic filling. A viscoelastic model incorporating a parallel viscous element fit the dynamic stress-strain data better and predicted the static elastic properties more accurately than a simple exponential model. Thus, the mechanical characteristics of the diastolic left ventricle can be represented most precisely by a viscoelastic model that includes a parallel viscous element...|$|R
40|$|Septal {{displacement}} is postulated as {{an important}} mediator of ventricular interdependence. During acute right ventricular loading with the Mueller manoeuvre the septum flattens and shifts leftward. To investigate the mechanism of this septal deformation, we measured transseptal pressures in nine patients during Mueller manoeuvres with simultaneous right and left ventricular <b>micromanometers,</b> and left ventricular configuration with two-dimensional echocardiograms. Data were analysed throughout diastole and at end-systole during control and maximum Mueller manoeuvre (- 40 to - 80 mmHg airway pressure). Leftward septal displacement during the Mueller manoeuvre was evidenced {{by an increase in}} septal radius of curvature at end-diastole persisting through end-systole. The left ventricular free wall radius of curvature was unchanged. During the Mueller manoeuvre, the left ventricular cavity area decreased significantly in the cross-sectional view. All Mueller manoeuvres were associated with a decrease in left-to-right ventricular transseptal pressure gradient throughout diastole. There was no significant change in the gradient at end-systole; septal flattening persisted, however, despite a pronounced left to right pressure gradient. Thus, diastolic septal flattening during right ventricular loading is associated with a decreased transseptal pressure gradient but does not require right ventricular diastolic pressure to exceed left ventricular diastolic pressure. The persistence of flattening in systole suggests that once septal shift occurs during diastole, other forces during systole maintain the deformity despite a large intracavitary transseptal gradient...|$|R
