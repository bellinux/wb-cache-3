40|$|<b>Marketing</b> <b>management</b> {{support systems}} (MMSS) are computer-enabled devices that help {{marketers}} {{to make better}} decisions. Marketing processes can be quite complex, involving large numbers of variables and mostly outcomes are {{the results of the}} actions of many different stakeholders (e. g., the company itself, its customers, its competitors). Moreover, a large number of interdependencies exist between the relevant variables and the outcomes of marketing actions are subject to major uncertainties. Given the complexities of the <b>market</b> place, <b>marketing</b> <b>management</b> support systems are useful tools to help the marketing decision makers carry out their jobs. <b>Marketing</b> <b>management</b> support systems can only be effective when they are optimally geared towards their users. We, therefore, deal with decision making in marketing (which generates the need for <b>marketing</b> <b>management</b> support systems). We discuss how marketing decisions are made, how they should be made, and the relative roles of analytical versus intuitive cognitive processes in marketing decision-making. We also discuss the match between marketing problem-solving modes and the various types of <b>marketing</b> <b>management</b> support systems. Finally we discuss how the impact of MMSS can be improved. This is important, given the current under-utilization of MMSS in practice. We discuss the conditions for the successful implementation and effective use of <b>marketing</b> <b>management</b> support systems. The issue ends with a discussion of the opportunities and challenges for <b>marketing</b> <b>management</b> support systems as we foresee them...|$|R
