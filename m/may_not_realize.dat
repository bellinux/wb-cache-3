5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} (DKA) is {{a potentially}} life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Signs and symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, deep gasping breathing, increased urination, weakness, confusion, and occasionally loss of consciousness. A person's breath may develop a specific smell. Onset of symptoms is usually rapid. In some cases people <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> they previously had diabetes.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people with}} TS <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon}} for the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It {{is not uncommon for}} several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E

25|$|The Argonne {{study found}} that PHEVs offered {{reductions}} in petroleum energy use as compared with regular hybrid electric vehicles. More petroleum energy savings and also more GHG emissions reductions were realized as the all-electric range increased, except when electricity used to recharged was dominated by coal or oil-fired power generation. As expected, electricity from renewable sources realized the largest reductions in petroleum energy use and GHG emissions for all PHEVs as the all-electric range increased. The study also concluded that plug-in vehicles that employ biomass-based fuels (biomass-E85 and -hydrogen) <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> GHG emissions benefits over regular hybrids if power generation is dominated by fossil sources.|$|E
500|$|Research has {{confirmed}} that when nearsighted subjects remove their corrective lenses, over {{time there is}} a limited improvement (termed [...] "blur adaptation") in their unaided visual resolution, even though refraction indicates no corresponding change in refractive error.

That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently.

500|$|Williams {{has stated}} that the game's events are open to interpretation. Many {{different}} theories have been discussed by the development staff. Davis described the game's pacing as [...] "deliberate", {{but he added that}} there are moments where the pacing slows down significantly and allows the player {{to learn more about the}} game's story through inspecting environmental objects. The city of Dubai is filled with graffiti, which is used to give players information regarding the factions and the backstory. According to Yager, the graffiti was designed to give players a perspective that is different from the main game, and to help make the location more realistic. The team also hoped to make players feel lost when playing the game. As a result, the team added hallucination to the game. The team hoped that by using hallucination as a plot device, they could create a snowball effect and engage players more fully in the story as they complete the game. These hallucinations sometimes occur through the subtext, in which players <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> their presence. Williams added that having subtext is important, and that the [...] "best stories are the ones that have stuff hidden in them". The game fades to black when the game transitions from one scene to another, and it fades to white when Walker is hallucinating or otherwise deceiving himself.|$|E
500|$|Crackdown was envisioned {{to exceed}} the {{gameplay}} of Grand Theft Auto, giving the player [...] "toys" [...] {{to create their own}} in-game moments that could be verbally shared with others. [...] The crackdown logo is {{in the shape of the}} agency tower, modified. The entire playfield was to be open at the start, requiring the need to create a progression for the player, while still allowing for experimentation. [...] Realtime Worlds had hired a number of former Grand Theft Auto developers who experimented with refining the game's sandbox element. [...] "It was a big part of the idea to just let people do things", Realtime Worlds producer Phil Wilson said about the gameplay; [...] "testers would do things we were completely blown away by". Dave Jones, CEO of Realtime Worlds, described the concept of the game as [...] "How do we reward somebody for just having fun?" [...] They had initially planned to have 200 Xbox Live Achievements for the game towards this purpose, exceeded the then-current cap of 50 set by Microsoft, and pressured Microsoft to lift the cap. [...] Microsoft subsequently increased the maximum number of Achievements in a game to 80. [...] Through playtesting, the team noticed that many players performed certain out-of-the-way actions, such as climbing to the top of the Agency Tower. [...] They created in-game content to reward the player for performing these actions; for example, they created a special rendering procedure for the clouds during the in-game day/night cycle. The renderer would behave differently each day, and could only be viewed from atop the Agency Tower. [...] An initial fear of Jones' was that in the early part of the game, when the Agent is underpowered, the player <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> the potential of the game and would not complete it; [...] "People weren't quite sure, because at that level, you're kind of like most characters in most other games". [...] Jones also expressed concern that [...] "This game does not look good in screenshots". [...] They took two major steps to overcome this. [...] First, the demo for the game on Xbox Marketplace allowed for accelerated growth of the player's abilities. [...] Second, the full game included five in-game movies that would be presented early on to the player that would give them a taste for what a fully powered character could do.|$|E

2500|$|A {{criticism}} {{of the use of}} this technique in clinical practice is that it produces colored areas with definite boundaries superimposed upon an MRI scan: the untrained viewer <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> that the colors do not represent a physiological certainty, because of the relatively low spatial resolution of MEG, but rather a probability cloud derived from statistical processes. [...] However, when the magnetic source image corroborates other data, it can be of clinical utility.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prostitutes in}} illegal massage parlors {{may be forced}} to work out of {{apartment}} complexes for many hours a day. Many clients <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> that some of the women who work in these massage sex parlors are actually forced in prostitution. The women may initially be lured into the US under false pretenses. In huge debt to their 'owners', they are forced to earn enough to eventually [...] "buy" [...] their freedom. In some cases women who have been sex trafficked {{may be forced to}} undergo plastic surgery or abortions. A chapter in The Slave Next Door (2009) reports that human trafficking and sexual enslavement are not limited to any specific location or social class. It concludes that individuals in society need to be alert to report suspicious behavior, because the psychological and physical abuse occurs which can often leave a victim unable to escape on their own.|$|E
2500|$|Munk {{applied for}} American {{citizenship}} in 1939 after the Anschluss and {{enlisted in the}} ski troops of the U.S. Army as a private. This was unusual as all the other young men at Scripps joined the U.S. Naval Reserve. Munk was eventually excused from military service to undertake defense-related research at Scripps. He joined several of his colleagues from Scripps at the U.S. Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory, where they developed methods related to amphibious warfare. Their methods were used successfully to predict surf conditions for Allied landings in North Africa, the Pacific theater of war, and on D-Day during the Normandy invasion. [...] Munk commented in 2009, [...] "The Normandy landing is famous because weather conditions were very poor and you <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> it was postponed by General Eisenhower for 24 hours because of the prevailing wave conditions.

2500|$|Genericization or [...] "loss of {{secondary}} meaning" [...] may be either {{among the general}} population or among just a subpopulation, for example, {{people who work in}} a particular industry. Some examples of the latter type from the vocabulary of physicians include the names Luer-Lok (Luer lock), Phoroptor (phoropter), and Port-a-Cath (portacath), which have genericized mind share (among physicians) because (1) the users <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> that the term is a brand name rather than a medical eponym or generic-etymology term, and (2) no alternative generic name for the idea readily comes to mind. Most often, genericization occurs because of heavy advertising that fails to provide an alternative generic name or that uses the trademark in similar fashion to generic terms. [...] Thus, when the Otis Elevator Company advertised that it offered [...] "the latest in elevator and escalator design," [...] it was using the well-known generic term [...] "elevator" [...] and Otis's trademark [...] "Escalator" [...] for moving staircases in the same way. [...] The Trademark Office and the courts concluded that, if Otis used their trademark in that generic way, they could not stop Westinghouse from calling its moving staircases [...] "escalators", and a valuable trademark was lost through genericization.|$|E
2500|$|Bob Thomas, senior {{executive}} {{of the church in}} the early 1970s, gave a prosaic description.The immediate goal of the E-meter is to enhance communication. In other words, just to take a parallel: if an analyst were allowing his patient to free-associate, and the patient were connected in some way with a galvanometer which showed the analyst what things the patient mentioned were emotionally charged and what things were not emotionally charged, a lot of time would be saved. So it's simply an assist for the practitioner to direct the individual to areas which he himself <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> are troubled or charged with emotion or are repressed; and to better direct his attention into those areas ...The E-meter is a simple psycho-galvanometer. It's got some increased sensitivity built into it and the myological reactions that you sometimes get in the galvanometer have been damped out by the circuitry, so that the mental reactions, the reactions of the spirit, on the body are emphasized and can be read more clearly. But that's simply the design of the circuitry; it doesn't basically affect the kind of device. It registers what is called, commonly, the psychogalvanomic reflex, which is a reflex that is a poorly understood mechanism of the psyche. The body resistance seems to vary when the individual thinks of a painful or pain-associated or traumatic-associated concept, or word or idea. ... Some very early work was done on this by Jung ..."p.62-64 ...|$|E
2500|$|Edit wars {{can also}} occur as users repetitively revert a page to the version they favor. In some cases, editors with {{opposing}} views of which content should appear or what formatting style {{should be used}} will change and re-change each other's edits. This results in the page being [...] "unstable" [...] from a general users' perspective, because each time a general user comes to the page, it may look different. Some wiki software allows an administrator to stop such edit wars by locking a page from further editing until a {{decision has been made}} on what version of the page would be most appropriate. Some wikis are in a better position than others to control behavior due to governance structures existing outside the wiki. For instance, a college teacher can create incentives for students to behave themselves on a class wiki they administer by limiting editing to logged-in users and pointing out that all contributions {{can be traced back to}} the contributors. Bad behavior can then be dealt with in accordance with university policies. The issue of wiki vandalism is debated. In some cases, when an editor deletes an entire article and replaces it with nonsense content, it may be a [...] "test edit", made by the user as she or he is experimenting with the wiki system. Some editors <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> that they have damaged the page, or if they do realize it, they may not know how to undo the mistake or restore the content.|$|E
