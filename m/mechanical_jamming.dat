50|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>jamming</b> {{is caused}} by devices which reflect or re-reflect radar energy back to the radar to produce false target returns on the operator's scope. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>jamming</b> devices include chaff, corner reflectors, and decoys.|$|E
50|$|Pulse-Doppler signal {{processing}} selectively excludes low-velocity reflections {{so that no}} detections occurs below a threshold velocity. This eliminates terrain, weather, biologicals, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>jamming</b> {{with the exception of}} decoy aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, jamming {{of either}} type {{may be caused}} by {{friendly}} sources. Inadvertent <b>mechanical</b> <b>jamming</b> is fairly common because it is indiscriminate and will affect any nearby radars, hostile or not. Electronic jamming can also be inadvertently caused by friendly sources, usually powerful EW platforms operating within range of the affected radar. Unintentional electronic jamming is most easily prevented by good planning and common sense, though sometimes it is unavoidable.|$|E

50|$|Radar jamming and {{deception}} (electronic countermeasures) is the intentional emission of radio frequency signals {{to interfere with}} the operation of a radar by saturating its receiver with noise or false information.

40|$|Compression molding of near net-shaped rib-stiffened plates {{has been}} {{performed}} for a parametric investigation on the filling behavior of chopped woven flake reinforcements. The experimental investigation showed that different aspect ratios of ribs can be filled completely within the tested maximum ratio of flake size to rib opening width of 6. 25 {{and a maximum}} consolidation pressure of 15 bar. However, defects such as voids, non-impregnated regions and fiber matrix separation may arise depending on the combination of parameters and a <b>mechanical</b> <b>jamming</b> effect caused by the woven architecture of the flakes. A tendency for a limiting consolidation pressure is observed based on the fiber matrix separation. The ability to re-use thermoplastic prepreg cutting waste has been demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|The reheat-stop-valve (RHSV) {{mechanism}} {{is a principal}} component in a steam turbine unit which controls the running state. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>jamming</b> and incompletence often occur during closing the mechanism. This paper proposes a method to quantitatively investigate {{the cumulative effect of}} dimensional tolerance, misalignment and thermal impact on the dynamic performance with shaft and bearing pairs in a RHSV mechanism. Finite element method is employed to study the effect of thermal impact on the clearance of the shaft and bearing pairs. Then, we calculate the clearance of the shaft and bearing pairs considering thermal impact and dimensional tolerance. Based on the non-linear clearance and misalignment, a model named compensation cone is developed to establish the multi-support mechanism of the shaft and bearings system. The method is demonstrated by applying to the RHSV mechanism in a supercritical steam turbine unit. The results indicate that the combined effect of dimensional tolerance, misalignment and thermal impact exerts great effect on the performance of mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Jamming is a {{physical}} process which is both easy to describe and incredibly difficult to understand. One such difficulty is that <b>mechanical</b> treatments of <b>jamming</b> focus on pressure, force, stress, and strain, which are identically zero below jamming, {{making it hard to}} differentiate systems whcih which are near or far from the transition. Instead, I introduce a geometric framework based on the Voronoi tesselation which treats all of phase space on an equal footing. This work will show that the jamming transition can be seen entirely through the geometry of the local environment of particles encoded in the Voronoi tesselation, and it will build the framework for an as yet undefined field theory for jamming...|$|R
40|$|Breakup ice jams can {{significantly}} impact {{the operation of}} water resources projects, river ecology, residential property and the infrastructure of local communities. The complex mechanisms involved and the usual lack of observed data {{make it difficult to}} determine the timing and severity of past ice jams. In this paper, frequency and severity of past ice jams on the lower Grasse River were estimated from historical and anecdotal evidence, the results of an extensive survey of tree scars along the banks, and a hindcasting analysis based on water discharge and estimated ice thickness at the time of breakup. From analysis of the historical data, site specific criteria were derived for <b>mechanical</b> breakup and <b>jamming</b> potential based on ice thickness and stage increase during the breakup period...|$|R
40|$|The <b>mechanical</b> {{properties}} of <b>jammed</b> packings depend sensitively on their detailed local structure. Here we provide a complete {{characterization of the}} pair correlation close to contact and of the force distribution of jammed frictionless spheres. In particular we discover a set of new scaling relations that connect the behavior of particles bearing small forces and those bearing no force but that are almost in contact. By performing systematic investigations for spatial dimensions d= 3 - 10, in a wide density range and using different preparation protocols, we show that these scalings are indeed universal. We therefore establish clear milestones {{for the emergence of}} a complete microscopic theory of jamming. This description is also crucial for high-precision force experiments in granular systems...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{structural}} and <b>mechanical</b> properties of <b>jammed</b> ellipse packings, {{and find that}} the nature of the jamming transition in these systems is fundamentally different from that for spherical particles. Ellipse packings are generically hypostatic with more degrees of freedom than constraints. The spectra of low energy excitations possess two gaps and three distinct branches over a range of aspect ratios. In the zero compression limit, the energy of the modes in the lowest branch increases quartically with deformation amplitude, and the density of states possesses a δ-function at zero frequency. We identify scaling relations that collapse the low-frequency part of the spectra for different aspect ratios. Finally, we find that the degree of hypostaticity is determined by the number of quartic modes of the packing. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{properties of}} static, jammed packings of monodisperse spheres {{in the vicinity}} of the jamming transition are investigated using large-scale computer simulations. At small wave number k, we argue that the anomalous behavior in the static structure factor, S(k) similar to k, is consequential of an excess of low-frequency, collective excitations seen in the vibrational spectrum. This anomalous feature becomes more pronounced closest to the jamming transition, such that S(0) - 3 ̆e 0 at the transition point. We introduce an appropriate dispersion relation that accounts for these phenomena that leads us to relate these structural features to characteristic length scales associated with the low-frequency vibrational modes of these systems. When the particles are frictional, this anomalous behavior is suppressed providing yet more evidence that the jamming transitions for frictional spheres lie at lower packing fractions than for frictionless spheres. These results suggest that the <b>mechanical</b> properties of <b>jammed</b> and glassy media may therefore be inferred from measurements of both the static and dynamical structure factors...|$|R
40|$|Jamming [...] the {{mechanism}} by which granular media can transition between liquid-like and solid-like states-has recently been demonstrated as a variable strength and stiffness mechanism {{in a range of}} applications. As a low-cost and simple means for achieving tunable <b>mechanical</b> properties, <b>jamming</b> has been used in systems ranging from architectural to medical ones. This thesis explores the utility of jamming for robotic manipulation applications, both at a fundamental level of understanding how granular properties affect the performance of jammed systems, and at a more applied level of designing functional robotic components. Specifically, the purpose of this thesis was to enable engineers to design jammable robotic systems in a principled manner. Three parallel yet related studies were conducted to work towards this goal. First, an experimental analysis was conducted to determine whether the bulk shear strength of granular systems can be correlated with grain properties-such as ones concerning shape, size distribution, and surface texture-extracted from 2 D silhouettes of grains. Second, a novel medium composed of a mixture of hard and soft spheres was proposed to achieve variable strength and stiffness properties as a function of confining pressure; experimental analysis was conducted on this system with not only varying confining pressures but also varying mixing ratios of hard and soft spheres. Finally, the design and analysis of a novel jammable robotic manipulator-with the goal of maximizing both the strength and articulation of the system-is presented. by Nadia G. Cheng. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|We {{introduce}} a "Hamiltonian"-like function, called the volume function, indispensable {{to describe the}} ensemble of jammed matter such as granular materials and emulsions from a geometrical point of view. The volume function represents the available volume of each particle in the jammed systems. At the microscopic level, we show that the volume function is the Voronoi volume associated to each particle and in turn we provide an analytical formula for the Voronoi volume {{in terms of the}} contact network, valid for any dimension. We then develop a statistical theory for the probability distribution of the volumes in 3 d to calculate an average volume function coarse-grained at a mesoscopic level. The salient result is the discovery of a mesoscopic volume function inversely proportional to the coordination number. Our analysis {{is the first step toward}} the calculation of macroscopic observables and equations of state using the statistical mechanics of jammed matter, when supplemented by the condition of <b>mechanical</b> equilibrium of <b>jamming</b> that properly defines jammed matter at the ensemble level.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} concept of minimal {{rigidity}} as applied to soft repulsive, frictionless sphere packings in two-dimensions {{with the introduction of}} the jamming graph. Minimal rigidity is a purely combinatorial property encoded via Laman's theorem in two-dimensions. It constrains the global, average coordination number of the graph, for example. However, minimal rigidity does not address the geometry of local <b>mechanical</b> stability. The <b>jamming</b> graph contains both properties of global mechanical stability at the onset of <b>jamming</b> and local <b>mechanical</b> stability. We demonstrate how jamming graphs can be constructed using local moves via the Henneberg construction such that these graphs fall under the jurisdiction of correlated percolation. We then probe how jamming graphs destabilize, or become unjammed, by deleting a bond and computing the resulting rigid cluster distribution. We also study how the system restabilizes with the addition of new contacts and how a jamming graph with extra/redundant contacts destabilizes. The latter endeavor allows us to probe a disc packing in the rigid phase and uncover a potentially new diverging lengthscale associated with the random deletion of contacts as compared to the study of cut-out (or frozen in) subsystems.

Of course we like all kinds of other stuff too, but it's the dance that gets us going on Jane. We played once at the Animal Collective practice space, but found it much more pleasant to play at Scotty's home in Greenpoint where he had his mixer and simple microphones and we would drink brews and talk about all kinds of things and then play. I would usually sing about stuff I was thinking about that day and Scotty would move with it, playing jams and it would all kind of pour out. We liked all the <b>mechanical</b> robo dance <b>jams</b> from Detroit and Chicago and Germany but we wanted to do something with less 0's and 1's and more souls.
