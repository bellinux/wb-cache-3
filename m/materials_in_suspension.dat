40|$|This {{research}} performs {{life cycle}} analysis of threaded unions manufactured in PVC. The analysis proposes two scenarios {{according to the}} amount of recycled material used in the process. One of the scenarios is based on 45 % of recycled material and the other one is based on 100 % of raw virgin material usage. The analysis was made by means of the software tool Simapro® version 7. 0, establishing the environmental impact rating by the Ecoindicator 99 methodology. Data were collected from databases, observation and measurement of an industrial process, specific prototype development under laboratory conditions and interviews with experts. When a composition of 100 % of virgin raw material was used for the product, significant effects observed during the product´s life cycle were related to fossil fuel consumption and the generation of inorganic <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> <b>suspension.</b> For a product composition with 45 % of recycled material, the most significant effects were related to the generation of inorganic <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> and climate change.

40|$|White biotechnologies {{have several}} {{challenges}} to overcome {{in order to}} become a viable industrial process. Achieving highly concentrated lignocellulose materials and releasing fermentable substrates, with controlled kinetics in order to regulate micro-organism activity, present major technical and scientific bottlenecks. The degradation of the main polymeric fractions of lignocellulose into simpler molecules is a prerequisite for an integrated utilisation of this resource in a biorefinery concept. The characterisation methods and the observations developed for rheology, morphology, etc., that are reviewed here are strongly dependent on the fibrous nature of lignocellulose, are thus similar or constitute a good approach to filamentous culture broths. This review focuses on scientific works related {{to the study of the}} rheological behaviour of lignocellulose suspensions and their evolution during biocatalysis. In order to produce the targeted molecules (synthon), the lignocellulose substrates are converted by enzymatic degradation and are then metabolised by micro-organisms. The dynamics of the mechanisms is limited by coupled phenomena between flow, heat and mass transfers in regard to diffusion (within solid and liquid phases), convection (mixing, transfer coefficients, homogeneity) and specific inhibitors (concentration gradients). As lignocellulose suspensions consist of long entangled fibres for the matrix of industrial interest, they exhibit diverse and complex properties linked to this fibrous character (rheological, morphological, thermal, mechanical and biochemical parameters). Among the main variables to be studied, the rheological behaviour of such suspensions appears to be determinant for process efficiency. It is this behaviour that will determine the equipment to be used and the strategies applied (substrate and biocatalysis feed, mixing, etc.). This review provides an overview of (i) the rheological behaviour of fibrous <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> <b>suspension,</b> (ii) the methods and experimental conditions for their measurements, (iii) the main models used and (iv) their evolution during biocatalytic reactions with a focus on enzymatic hydrolysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{spreading}} factor in testicular extract upon infectious and toxic lesions has become well known through the work of Duran-Reynals and others. It {{has been shown that}} under certain conditions testicular extract enhances infectious processes, 2 as well as the lesions produced by bacterial toxins and foreign sera in the sensitized animal (Shwartzman and Arthus phenomena). However, if the spreading of the infectious or toxic agent goes beyond a certain point (critical concentration per unit area), a partial or complete suppression of the lesion will result. This holds true for most bacteria and toxins. 4 In contrast, the lesions produced by filterable viruses and by tubercle bacilli, even in extremely high dilutions, are enhanced by the action of the extract. 4 8 The spreading factor has been demonstrated in normal mammalian tissues, particularly testicular tissue, 2 in malignant tissues, 3 in leech extracts, ' in invasive strains of many bacterial species, 5 and, more recently, in the venom of several species of poisonous snakes. 7 Testicular extract, so far as can be determined, modifies the lesions by increasing the permeability of the dermis and the connective tissues, thus permitting injected fluids and suspensions to be distributed passively through a larger area of tissue. This permeability of the dermis is {{not to be confused with}} the permeability of the vascular or lymphatic endothelium of the dermis.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{presented}} {{the calculation of}} mass balance of the <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> <b>suspension,</b> total phosphorus, total nitrogen, COD and BOD 5 within sewage collector A 6 {{in the area of}} Hajdrihova street No. 28 and behind the outfall from the stormwater overflow under the bridge at Riharjeva street in Ljubljana. The pollutant concentration was acquired on the basis of measurements which were carried out during the time period between the years 2004 and 2009, and it presents the basic data for conversion of mass balance at the above mentioned sample sites. The catchment area of sewage collector A 6 is expressly urbanised. During precipitation events, on the urbanised areas, due to impervious areas the precipitation waters are drained through the secondary sewage systems which are connected to the main collector. Rainwater run-off from the road surfaces, which is heavily polluted with hard particles and other pollutants due to tire wear, vehicle breaking, road surface wear and other sorts of dirt caused by the drivers, represents a considerable burden to the sewage system. This is valid mostly for the rainwater run-off after a longer period of drought. Due to high rates of discharge during the precipitations, and owing to economic reasons, the stormwater overflows have been installed. These stormwater overflows disburden the surplus of waste waters and rainfall waters into the water drainage system, which can destroy natural ecosystem and increase its eutrophication. This thesis presents a more detailed description of the first flush of precipitation event, sewage collector A 6, riverbasin of the river Gradaščica and the German standard ATV-A 128 E. In the calculation part of this thesis there follows the calculation of hydraulic burdening of sewage collector A 6 with the SWMM 5 model, and the calculation of mass balance for particular pollutants, both in sewage collector and river. The fact is that stormwater overflows protect the river insuficiently. Therefore, the Municipality of Ljubljana made the strategic spatial plan, where one of the targets is to make the river of Ljubljanica a river suitable for bathing again. So, we have envisaged the installation of five stormwater tanks and made the calculation of the necessary basin volumes based on the German standard ATV-A 128 E...|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the relative rates of sediment transport of an oolitic aragonite sand and a quartz quarry sand as possible beach renourishment materials has been conducted. When comparing equal volumes, the aragonite experienced less transport than the quartz in both the longshore and in the onshore-offshore directions. When comparing equal size fractions, in sizes 0. 35 mm and smaller, aragonite was less transportable. The quartz was less transportable in the sizes greater than 0. 35 mm. This trend was observed in two separate experiments and is attributed to the effective density ratio of aragonite to quartz, dissimilarities in roundness and sphericity, and to differential entrainment and transport of these <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> and bed load {{within the confines of}} the inherent bed roughness. The effective density ratio of aragonite to quartz is highest in the smaller grain sizes and decreases with increasing grain size because the larger aragonitic grains possess fewer oolitic lamellae per grain and resemble their initial biogenic nucleus. In the smaller size fractions where suspension transport is thought to predominate, a larger quartz grain is hydraulically equivalent to a smaller aragonite grain due to the greater density of the aragonite. The aragonite has a higher settling velocity out of suspension and it is less entrainable, due to sheltering effects in the bed matrix allowing a lower position in the velocity profile and a larger reactive angle to the flow. As grain size increases above 0. 35 mm, the density of the aragonite approaches that of the quartz. The principle of hydraulic equivalence suggests that for two materials of similar density, there should be no difference in the entrainment and transportability between equal size fractions. The preferential transport of the aragonite relative to the quartz in the size fractions greater than 0. 35 mm is attributed to the difference in their shape, where the rounder aragonite is more easily rolled in traction as the size of both the aragonite and quartz exceed the background bed roughness. The physical characteristics of aragonite indicate that it has a hydraulic behavior similar to a quartz sand of a slightly larger size. If renourishment is undertaken on John U. Lloyd Beach with aragonite, the most probable source material would be a mining stockpile (mean size 0. 52 mm) from Ocean Cay in the Bahamas. Based on a theoretical (mean size only) method of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, utilization of this stockpile material would reduce the erosion rate on Lloyd Beach by 10 %. The results of my study indicate that beach losses could be further reduced by using this aragonite due its higher density. Secondary characteristics such as density and shape of the renourishment material manifest themselves differently in the suspension and bed load modes of transport and should be considered when choosing a borrow source. Additional transport studies need to be done utilizing larger volumes of material and monitored over a longer time interval...|$|E

Due to its high tensile strength,small mass density,excellent corrosion and fatigue resistant ability,the carbon fiber reinforced polymer(CFRP) is the ideal material for the main cable of <b>suspension</b> bridge. <b>In</b> this paper, the feasibility of applying CFRP <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> the <b>suspension</b> bridges was proved and the applicable spans for the suspension bridges with CFRP cables were also provided. ...|$|R

The limnological variables determined were dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, nitrate, turbidity, water temperature and flow. In lab protocols the <b>material</b> <b>in</b> full <b>suspension,</b> total and dissolved phosphorus, and orthophosphate were determined. Monitoring results were tabulated and the principal component analysis. The {{results indicate that the}} Veado stream causes a disruption in the natural gradient of the main channel, the Limoeiro stream. ...|$|R
30|$|The samples after {{mechanical}} grinding and sieving (Bol 1 a, 1 b, 1 c) display calcite/montmorillonite (Cal/Mon) intensity ratios {{that are}} quite different compared to the intensity ratio before the grain size separation (Bol 1); Cal/Mon increases with sieving. The same result is observed after washing; the <b>material</b> that remains <b>in</b> <b>suspension,</b> which is brownish in colour, has a Cal/Mon ratio that {{is higher than the}} black material collected from the bottom deposit. Ten washing cycles were necessary for an accurate separation of the various fractions.|$|R

He accomplished this by triturating the soil {{in the presence of}} water, decanting the supernatant and then permitting the clay particles to settle out. The <b>material</b> which remained <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> after 24 hours settling, he designated clay colloid. It comprised 1. 5 $ of the weight of the whole soil and was thought by Schloesing to be amorphous in nature. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|For most {{reason for}} dry {{suspension}} is the drug changes from chemical degradation or hydrolysis like ampicillin. The dry syrups that require mixing prior to administration is solving the problem. These suspension are commersial, dry mixtures {{that require the}} addition of water {{at the time of}} dispensing. Many antibiotics are formulated as dry syrups and are intented for a pediatric patient population. There are usually fewer suspending <b>material</b> <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> dry syrup than <b>in</b> convensional <b>suspensions.</b> The criteria for selecting inggredients are based both on suitable reconstitution and on physical tipe of powder mixture desired. This research was carried out the possibility of using phycical and chemical modification of cassava starch as suspending material. First, pregelatinized cassava starch was made by heated the cassava starch with added amount water. Secondly,  phosphorylated by adding phosphorous oxychloride for making cross-linked reaction and adding sodium monohydrogen phosphate (Na 2 HPO 4) for making substituted reaction respectively. Both of the cassava starch phosphate derived was used in tree formulas dry syrup, as comparative suspending material was Na Alginate. Then dry syrup was evaluated accordance to Indonesian  Farmacopea ed IV included sedimentation volume, redispersion, viscosity, flowing properties, pH, and ampicillin content after seven days. The result of evaluation were particle size 355 - 500 Âµm, flow rate 2, 7 - 4, 6 g/ det. Sedimention volume at temperature 27 ÂºC during seven days for all formulas were 0, 8 - 1, 0, and redispertion 3 - 5 times. The viskosity of the suspensions were 58, 6 - 357, 1 cps. Flowing properties of the liquids were plastis -plastis tixotropic, pH 4, 97 - 5, 21, and ampicillin content between 93, 12 - 99, 00 %...|$|R
