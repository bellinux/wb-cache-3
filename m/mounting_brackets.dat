5|$|The design {{specifications}} were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let {{to build the}} components. Three different plants were used {{so that no one}} would have a copy of the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the tail fairing and <b>mounting</b> <b>brackets</b> by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan. The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. The uranium-235 projectile was completed on 15 June, and the target on 24 July. The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 16 July aboard the heavy cruiser , arriving on 26 July. The target inserts followed by air on 30 July.|$|E
25|$|Mounting base: Attaches the {{mounting}} {{system to the}} vehicle. This element is commonly composed of rugged materials such as steel. Tunnel Mounts attach to the raised floor area (drive shaft tunnel) between the driver and passenger. Passenger Side Mounts attach to floor {{on the passenger side}} of the vehicle. Console <b>mounting</b> <b>brackets</b> attach to an existing vehicle center console. Trunk Mounts provide mounting options for use inside car trunks.|$|E
25|$|An entirely fresh {{approach}} was also taken by AMC engineers with the Pacer's front suspension and engine mounting. It {{was the first}} U.S. small car to isolate the engine and suspension system noises from the passenger compartment. The entire front suspension was mounted on a crossmember isolated from the frame extensions by heavy rubber bushings. It is also different from all other AMC cars with the coil spring between the two control arms, seated on the lower wishbone arm {{at the bottom and}} in the suspension/engine mount crossmember at the top. The rear suspension was also isolated, requiring a special tool to press the one-piece bushings {{in and out of the}} <b>mounting</b> <b>brackets.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|R
25|$|Earnhardt {{began the}} 2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series season by {{finishing}} 32nd at the Daytona 500 {{as the result}} of a late race crash. His first Top 10 came at Bristol Motor Speedway in the Food City 500, where he finished 7th. His first Top 5 came at Martinsville Speedway in the Goody's Cool Orange 500. He led 136 laps and finished 5th. He collected his third Top 10 of the season and his 8th at Talladega Superspeedway with his 7th-place performance in the 2007 Aaron's 499. On May 14, he was docked 100 driver championship points, car owner Teresa Earnhardt was docked 100 owner points, and his crew chief, Tony Eury Jr., was fined $100,000 and suspended for 6 races due to the use of illegal <b>mounting</b> <b>brackets</b> used to attach the wing to his car. During the April race at Texas Motor Speedway he drove the last 10 laps in the No. 5 car of Kyle Busch owned by Rick Hendrick.|$|E
25|$|For {{bands that}} include a front {{ensemble}} (also known as the pit or auxiliary percussion), stationary instrumentation may include orchestral percussion such as timpani, tambourines, maracas, cowbells, congas, wood blocks, marimbas, xylophones, bongos, vibraphones, timbales, claves, guiros, and chimes or tubular bells, concert bass drums, and gongs, {{as well as a}} multitude of auxiliary percussion equipment. Drum sets, purpose-built drum racks, and other mounted instruments are also placed here. Until the advent of the pit in the early 1980s, many of these instruments were actually carried on the field by marching percussionists by hand or on <b>mounting</b> <b>brackets.</b> Some bands also include electronic instruments such as synthesizers, electric guitars, and bass guitar, along with the requisite amplification. If double-reed or string instruments are used, they are usually placed here, but even this usage is very rare due to their relative fragility. Unusual percussive instruments are sometimes used, including brake drums, empty propane tanks, trashcans, railroad ties, stomping rigs, and other interesting sounds.|$|E
500|$|Two {{types of}} gun design were produced: Type A was of high alloy steel, and Type B of more {{ordinary}} steel. Type B {{was chosen for}} production because it was lighter. The primers and propellant {{were the same as}} those previously chosen for Thin Man. Scale test firing of the hollow projectile and target insert was conducted with the 3-inch/50 caliber gun and a [...] Hispano cannon. Starting in December, test firing was done full-scale. Amazingly, the first test case produced {{turned out to be the}} best ever made. It was used in four test firings at the Anchor Ranch, and ultimately in the Little Boy used in the bombing of Hiroshima. The design specifications were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let to build the components. Three different plants were used so that no one would have a copy of the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target, case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the tail fairing and <b>mounting</b> <b>brackets</b> by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} accident, the ATSB {{announced}} that air safety investigators {{found that an}} oxygen cylinder which was located {{in the area of}} the explosion had not been accounted for, but that it was too early to say that an oxygen cylinder could be the cause of the mid-air explosion on QF30. [...] Regardless, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority ordered Qantas to inspect all of its oxygen cylinders and brackets which hold the cylinders on its Boeing 747 fleet. The valve and <b>mounting</b> <b>brackets</b> were found, but not the bottle, number four of thirteen fitted in that bank.

40|$|One of {{the main}} causes of {{vibration}} that produce by a car is engine and transmission. Engine and transmission location determination is an important thing that must be considered for a car. Method of locating engine and transmission will be proposed to determine the right position. This method depends to the size and type of engines. The project objective {{is to find a}} location for the engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> for a new car. It is important to reduce the vibration from the engine and transmission to the carâ€™s body or chassis. These is also important to fit the engine bay before consider the component of engine clearance with component of body. The stress analysis is done for the location test, different thickness of side member, and different cross section of side member. The FEA software Algor is use for this analysis and Solidwork to modeling the side member. Five different cross section and design are use to analyze the location of the engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket.</b> The range location of the <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> is at the middle of the side member. This range depends to the packaging of the engine and the clearance between the components of engine with engine bay. Thickness of the side member also important to decrease the weight of the car and to minimize the stress value when load apply.

2500|$|Identification of Trains and Routing Automatically (IDENTRA) was {{implemented}} {{on the line}} in the 1957 and used until 1997, when a route selector punch box with B1 Astoria, local/express buttons was installed at the 10/11 car marker on the upper level of Queensboro Plaza. IDENTRA used a removable round circular disc type radio antenna assembly, slide-mounted on the small <b>mounting</b> <b>brackets</b> that were attached on the front of R12, R14, R15, and R17 cars that were assigned to the 7 route, which had been used on the line since 1948. Similar to the use of radio transponders in the CBTC installation, the system used the antennas to determine whether a train was running local or express, and then accordingly switched the track at interlockings near the Queensboro Plaza and Flushingâ€“Main Street stations. This move reduced the number of signal towers on the line from 9 to 2 and allowed to operate 37 eleven-car trains instead of only 30 nine-car trains per hour. The consolidated signal system was in use by 1956 while the selector system was in service by 1958. This system, still in use by many transit agencies such as SEPTA's Broad Street Line, is also nicknamed the [...] "toilet seat" [...] because the removable disc antenna is shaped like a toilet seat.|$|E
2500|$|Partway {{through this}} year and in limited quantities, a new 427 {{replaced}} the 406 for racing applications. It was intended to meet NHRA and NASCAR 7-liter maximum engine size rules. This engine was rated at a [...] with 2 x 4 barrel Holley carburetors and a solid lifter camshaft. Ford also made available aluminum cylinder heads as a dealer option. The 1963Â½ was still overweight, however. To be competitive in drag racing Ford produced 212 (around 170 from Ford Norfolk, about 20 from Ford Los Angeles) lightweight versions of the [...] "R" [...] code 427, in the Galaxie 500 Sport Special Tudor Fastback. Available only in Corinthian White with red vinyl interior, and with a list price of about US$4,200 (when a base Ford 300 went for US$2,324, and XL Fastback was US$3,268), these cars came stock with Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed, 4.11:1 rear axle, heavy-duty suspension and brakes, and were fitted with a fiberglass hood (a flat piece at first, late in 1963 the popular blister hood also used on the Thunderbolt), trunk, front fenders, and fender aprons, as well as aluminum bumpers and <b>mounting</b> <b>brackets,</b> transmission cases, and bellhousing. Hood springs, heater, trunk lining and mat, spare wheel and tire (and mounting bracket), trunk lid torsion bar, jack, lug wrench, one horn (of the stock two), armrests, rear ashtrays, courtesy lights, and dome light were removed to reduce weight. The first 20 cars had functional fiberglass doors, which shaved these were deleted because of Ford's concern for safety if used on the highway. The cars had all sound-deadening material removed, lightweight seats and floormats, and no options. They were not factory equipped with cold-air induction, as the Thunderbolt would be. In addition, they were built on the -lighter Ford 300 chassis, originally intended for a smaller-displacement V8. In all, the 427s were [...] lighter than before ( [...] with the fiberglass doors).|$|E
