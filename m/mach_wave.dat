40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{synthesize}} the most important results of the thesis work of Meredith (1990) concerning radiation from seismic sources in boreholes. Previous studies of radiation from sources in boreholes have been far-field studies and have neglected the explicit contribution of the borehole. In general, this is fine for P-wave radiation and for S-wave radiation into high velocity rocks. However, tube waves "leak" shear conical <b>waves</b> (<b>Mach</b> <b>waves)</b> which propagate when the tube wave velocity is greater than the shear wave velocity of the surrounding medium. These <b>Mach</b> <b>waves</b> are of high amplitude because of the dominance of the tube wave and radiate away from the borehole in a fixed conical shape. The shape of the cone is dependent on the shear wave velocity of the medium and the tube wave velocity. This paper defines the conditions under which these <b>Mach</b> <b>waves</b> exist and thoroughly describes them in a physical sense and less so in a mathematical sense. Finally, the relationship of <b>Mach</b> <b>waves</b> to data sets is examined and how <b>Mach</b> <b>waves</b> may be confused with receiver borehole tube waves. To keep the presentation simple, radiation from axial or torsional sources or radiation from empty boreholes is omitted in this paper but fully addressed in Meredith (1990).

40|$|A {{series of}} model {{experiments}} {{are done in}} the ultrasonic laboratory to study the ra-diation of downhole sources {{in a variety of}} formations. Three models are used in the experiments. They are a lucite model, a lucite model with free glass pipe in the center, and a glass cased soil model. In addition, the finite difference modelling technique is used to simulate the wave propagation in these models and the results of the laboratory and numerical experiments are compared. In the lucite borehole model the waveforms recorded in the experiment agree very well with the finite difference synthetics. The snapshots of the wavefield from finite difference simulation show the radiation pattern of the P and S wave in the lucite formation. These patterns are consistent with the theoretical calculations. In the lucite model with the free glass pipe, the finite difference synthetics are also in good agreement with the experimental observations, especially for the conical P-wave arrival. The angle between the wavefront of the conical P wave and the borehole axis observed from the snapshot agrees with the theory. In the cased soil model the arrival time of the finite difference synthetics is in good agreement with the lab measurements. The relative amplitudes of the P wave and <b>Mach</b> <b>wave</b> are not cor-rectly modelled because of no intrinsic attenuation in the finite difference calculation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} work {{investigates the}} effects of earthquake rupture complexity and heterogeneities in Earth structure on near-field ground-motions. More specifically, we address two key issues in seismology: (1) near-field ground-shaking variability as function of distance and azimuth for unilateral directive ruptures, and (2) impact of rupture complexity and seismic scattering on <b>Mach</b> <b>wave</b> coherence associated with supershear rupture propagation. We examine earthquake ground-motion variability associated with unilateral ruptures based on ground-motion simulations of the MW 7. 3 1992 Landers earthquake, eight simplified source models, and a MW 7. 8 rupture simulation (ShakeOut) for the San Andreas fault. Our numerical modeling reveals that the ground-shaking variability in near-fault distances (< 20 km) is larger than that given by empirical ground motion prediction equations. In addition, the variability decreases with increasing distance from the source, exhibiting a power-law decay. The high near-field variability {{can be explained by}} strong directivity effects whose influence weaken as we move away from the fault. At the same time, the slope of the power-law decay is found to be dominantly controlled by slip heterogeneity. Furthermore, the ground-shaking variability is high in the rupture propagation direction whereas low in the directions perpendicular to it. However, the variability expressed as a function of azimuth is not only sensitive to slip heterogeneity, but also to rupture velocity. To study <b>Mach</b> <b>wave</b> coherence for supershear ruptures, we consider heterogeneities in rupture parameters (variations in slip, rise time and rupture speed) and 3 D scattering media having small-scale random heterogeneities. The <b>Mach</b> <b>wave</b> coherence is reduced at near-fault distances (< 10 km) by the source heterogeneities. At the larger distances from the source, medium scattering plays the dominant role in reducing the <b>Mach</b> <b>wave</b> coherence. Combined effect of the source and medium heterogeneities on the supershear ruptures produce peak ground accelerations consistent with the estimates from empirical ground motion prediction equations. Therefore, we suggest that supershear ruptures may be more common in nature than detected...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{radiation}} {{of shock}} free supersonic jets is modified {{in comparison with}} subsonic jet noise because of <b>Mach</b> <b>wave</b> emission. Intense noise is radiated when turbulent structures are convected supersonically relative to the ambient sound speed. Using the framework of Lighthill’s equation, Ffowcs Williams and Maidanik developed an approximation of Lighthill’s term for a supersonically convected acoustic source in a turbulent shear layer. From this result, a model can be deduced for axisymmetric jets.

40|$|Regional {{surface wave}} {{observations}} offer {{a powerful tool}} for determining source properties of large earthquakes, especially rupture velocity. Supershear ruptures, being faster than surface wave phase velocities, create far-field surface <b>wave</b> <b>Mach</b> cones along which waves from all sections of the fault arrive simultaneously and, over a sufficiently narrow frequency band, in phase. We present the first observation of far-field <b>Mach</b> <b>waves</b> from the major Kokoxili earthquake (Tibet, 2001 / 11 / 14, M-w 7. 9) and confirm that ground motion amplitudes are indeed enhanced on the Mach cone. Theory predicts that on the Mach cone, bandpassed surface wave seismograms from a large supershear rupture will be identical to those from much smaller events with similar focal mechanisms, with an amplitude ratio equal to the ratio of the seismic moments of the two events. Cross-correlation of 15 - 25 s Love waves from the Kokoxili event with those from a much smaller (Mw 5) foreshock indicates a high degree of similarity (correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 8 to 0. 95) in waveforms recorded at stations near the far-field Mach cone. This similarity vanishes away from the Mach cone. These observations provide further evidence for supershear propagation of the Kokoxili rupture, and demonstrate how this simple waveform correlation procedure can be used to identify supershear ruptures.

The drop impact velocity was about 3. 5 m/s. Drop diameters were in the range of 2. 8 - 4. 0 mm. The target was a stainless steel disk of 3. 9 mm diameter. The drop spread beyond the target like a central cap surrounded by a thin, slightly conical lamella bounded by a thicker rim. By mounting a small obstacle near the target, surface-tension driven <b>Mach</b> <b>waves</b> in the flowing lamella were generated, which are formally equivalent to the familiar compressibility driven <b>Mach</b> <b>waves</b> in gas dynamics. From the measurement of the Mach angle, the values of some flow parameters could be obtained as functions of time, which provided insight into the flow structure. The liquid flowed from the central cap to the liquid rim through the thin lamella at constant momentum flux. At a certain stage of the process, most of the liquid accumulated in the rim and the internal part of the lamella became metastable. In this situation, a rupture wave propagating through the metastable internal part of the lamella caused the rim to retract while forming outwardly directed secondary jets.
