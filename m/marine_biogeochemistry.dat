40|$|The <b>marine</b> <b>biogeochemistries</b> {{of carbon}} and {{nitrogen}} {{have come under}} increased scrutiny because of their close involvement in climate change and coastal eutrophication. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the high-temperature combustion (HTC) technique is suitable for routine analyses of dissolved organic matter due to its good oxidation efficiency, high sensitivity, and precision. In our laboratory, a coupled HTC TOC-NCD system with a sample changer was used for the automated and simultaneous determination of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in seawater samples. TOC control software was used for TOC instrument control, DOC data acquisition, and data analysis. TDN data acquisition and manipulation was undertaken under LabVIEW. The combined system allowed simultaneous determination of DOC and TDN in the same sample using a single injection and provided low detection limits and excellent linear ranges for both DOC and TDN. The risk of contamination has been remarkably reduced due to the minimal sample manipulation and automated analyses. The optimised system provided a reliable tool for the routine determination of DOC and TDN in marine waters. © 2005 Hindawi Publishing Corporation...|$|R

A new paradigm for <b>marine</b> iron <b>biogeochemistry</b> was generated. The five major new items within this paradigm included (1) the nature of iron inputs to the sea, (2) chemical speciation of iron in seawater, (3) relationships between iron chemistry and marine microbial community dynamics, (4) adaptations of marine microbes to iron input, and (5) ecological and biogeochemical implications of changes in iron supply to the sea...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, Alfred C. Redfield found the {{similarity}} of the phytoplankton’s elemental composition to the major dissolved nutrients in the deep ocean. Redfield proposed that the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus (16:1) in the ocean was controlled by the phytoplankton’s requirements which subsequently release nitrogen and phosphorus as they are remineralized. This so-called “Redfield ratio” in describing stoichiometry of phytoplankton and seawater has become a fundamental principle to understand the <b>marine</b> ecology, <b>biogeochemistry</b> and phytoplankton evolution. However, Redfield ratio is not a universal value and it may diverge due to the changes in exogenous nutrient delivery and microbial metabolisms in the ocean, such as nitrogen fixation, denitrification and anammox.|$|R

5000|$|This scheme {{divides the}} {{plankton}} community into broad producer, consumer and recycler groups. However, determining the trophic level of many plankton {{is not always}} straightforward. For example, although most dinoflagellates are either photosynthetic producers or heterotrophic consumers, many species perform both roles. In this mixed trophic strategy — known as mixotrophy — organisms act as both producers and consumers, either {{at the same time}} or switching between modes of nutrition in response to ambient conditions. For instance, relying on photosynthesis for growth when nutrients and light are abundant, but switching to predation when growing conditions are poor. Recognition of the importance of mixotrophy as an ecological strategy is increasing, as well as the wider role this may play in <b>marine</b> <b>biogeochemistry.</b>|$|E

40|$|Centimeter-long {{electron}} conduction through marine sediments, in which electrons derived from sulfide in anoxic sediments are transported to oxygen in surficial sediments, {{may have an}} important influence on sediment geochemistry. Filamentous bacteria have been proposed to mediate the electron transport, but the filament conductivity could not be verified and other mechanisms are possible. Surprisingly, previous investigations have never actually measured the sediment conductivity or its basic physical properties. Here we report direct measurements that demonstrate centimeter-long electron flow through marine sediments, with conductivities sufficient to account for previously estimated electron fluxes. Conductivity was lost for oxidized sediments, which contrasts with the previously described increase in the conductivity of microbial biofilms upon oxidation. Adding pyrite to the sediments significantly enhanced the conductivity. These {{results suggest that the}} role of conductive minerals, which are more commonly found in sediments than centimeter-long microbial filaments, need to be considered when modeling <b>marine</b> sediment <b>biogeochemistry...</b>|$|R

50|$|As {{a part of}} the his {{pioneering}} {{efforts to}} investigate the impacts of global change on <b>marine</b> <b>biogeochemistry</b> of the northern Indian Ocean, Naqvi carried out extensive work on greenhouse gases dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) both in the open-ocean and seasonally-occurring coastal hypoxic zone. The coastal low-oxygen zone, the largest {{of its kind in the}} world, has been found to have intensified in recent years, affecting living resources and providing feedback to global change. The former is because denitrification removes all nitrate, at rates that are the highest ever measured from any marine system, culminating in sulphidic conditions, and the latter is due to unprecedented accumulation of N2O. Thus, it has been shown for the first time that human activities are causing an increase in oceanic emissions of N2O, and the efflux of this potent greenhouse gas from the Arabian Sea is globally significant, unlike those of CO2 and CH4.|$|E

40|$|This PhD thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} large-scale interactions between climate and <b>marine</b> <b>biogeochemistry.</b> To this end, centennial simulations are performed under present and projected future climate conditions with a coupled ocean-atmosphere model containing a complex <b>marine</b> <b>biogeochemistry</b> model. The role of <b>marine</b> <b>biogeochemistry</b> in the climate system is first investigated. Phytoplankton solar radiation absorption in the upper ocean enhances sea surface temperatures and upper ocean stratification. The associated increase in ocean latent heat losses raises atmospheric temperatures and water vapor. Atmospheric circulation is modified at tropical and extratropical latitudes with impacts on precipitation, incoming solar radiation, and ocean circulation which cause upper-ocean heat content to decrease at tropical latitudes and to increase at middle latitudes. <b>Marine</b> <b>biogeochemistry</b> is tightly related to physical climate variability, which may vary in response to internal natural dynamics or to external forcing such as anthropogenic carbon emissions. Wind changes associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the dominant mode of climate variability in the North Atlantic, affect ocean properties by means of momentum, heat, and freshwater fluxes. Changes in upper ocean temperature and mixing impact the spatial structure and seasonality of North Atlantic phytoplankton through light and nutrient limitations. These changes affect the capability of the North Atlantic Ocean of absorbing atmospheric CO 2 and of fixing it inside sinking particulate organic matter. Low-frequency NAO phases determine a delayed response of ocean circulation, temperature and salinity, which in turn affects stratification and <b>marine</b> <b>biogeochemistry.</b> In 20 th and 21 st century simulations natural wind fluctuations in the North Pacific, related to the two dominant modes of atmospheric variability, affect the spatial structure and {{the magnitude of the}} phytoplankton spring bloom through changes in upper-ocean temperature and mixing. The impacts of human-induced emissions in the 21 st century are generally larger than natural climate fluctuations, with the phytoplankton spring bloom starting one month earlier than in the 20 th century and with ~ 50 % lower magnitude.

40|$|In a {{changing}} climate, <b>marine</b> pelagic <b>biogeochemistry</b> may modulate the atmospheric concentrations of climate-relevant {{species such as}} CO 2 and N 2 O. To date, projections rely on earth system models, featuring simple pelagic biogeochemical model components, embedded into 3 -D ocean circulation models. Most of these biogeochemical model components rely on the hyperbolic Michaelis–Menten (MM) formulation which specifies the limiting effect of light and nutrients on carbon assimilation by autotrophic phytoplankton. The respective MM constants, along with other model parameters, of 3 -D coupled biogeochemical ocean-circulation models are usually tuned; the parameters are changed until a "reasonable" similarity to observed standing stocks is achieved. Here, we explore with twin experiments (or synthetic "observations") the demands on observations that allow for a more objective estimation of model parameters. We start with parameter retrieval experiments based on "perfect" (synthetic) observations which we distort, step by step, by low-frequency noise to approach realistic conditions. Finally, we confirm our findings with real-world observations. In summary, we find that MM constants are especially hard to constrain because even modest noise (10 %) inherent to observations may hinder the parameter retrieval already. This is of concern since the MM parameters are key to the model's sensitivity to anticipated changes in the external conditions. Furthermore, we illustrate problems caused by high-order parameter dependencies when parameter estimation is based on sparse observations of standing stocks. Somewhat counter to intuition, we find that more observational data can sometimes degrade the ability to constrain certain parameters...|$|R

40|$|Progress {{in marine}} {{chemistry}} {{has been driven}} by improved sampling and sample handling techniques, and developments in analytical chemistry. Consequently, during the last 20 years our understanding of <b>marine</b> trace metal <b>biogeochemistry</b> has improved a great deal.

40|$|Diatoms {{constitute}} a major group of phytoplankton, accounting for ~ 20 % of the world's primary production. It {{has been shown}} that iron (Fe) can be the limiting factor for phytoplankton growth, in particular, in the HNLC (High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll) regions. Iron plays thus an essential role in governing the marine primary productivity and the efficiency of biological carbon pump. Oceanic systems are undergoing continuous modifications at varying rates and magnitudes as a result of changing climate. The objective of our research is to evaluate how changing environmental conditions (dust deposition, ocean warming and acidification) can affect <b>marine</b> Fe <b>biogeochemistry</b> and diatom growth. Laboratory culture experiments using a marine diatom Chaetoceros socialis were conducted at two temperatures (13 °C and 18 °C) and under two pCO 2 (carbon dioxide partial pressure) (400 μatm and 800 μatm) conditions. The present study clearly highlights the effect of ocean acidification on enhancing the release of Fe upon dust deposition. Our results also confirm that being a potential source of Fe, dust provides in addition a readily utilizable source of macronutrients such as dissolved phosphate (PO 4) and silicate (DSi). However, elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentrations may also have an adverse impact on diatom growth, causing a decrease in cell size and possible further changes in phytoplankton composition. Meanwhile, ocean warming may lead to the reduction of diatom production and cell size, inducing poleward shifts in the biogeographic distribution of diatoms. The changing climate has thus a significant implication for ocean phytoplankton growth, cell size and primary productivity, phytoplankton distribution and community composition, and carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), silicon (Si) and Fe biogeochemical cycles in various ways...|$|R

40|$|The ocean {{carbon cycle}} is tightly {{linked with the}} cycles of the major {{nutrient}} elements nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon. It is therefore likely that enrichment of the ocean with anthropogenic CO 2 and attendant acidification will have large consequences for <b>marine</b> nutrient <b>biogeochemistry,</b> and for the microbes that mediate many key nutrient transformations. The best available {{evidence suggests that the}} nitrogen cycle may respond strongly to higher CO 2 through increases in global N 2 fixation and possibly denitrification, as well as potential decreases in nitrification. These trends could cause nitrification to become a nitrogen cycle “bottleneck,” by increasing the flux of N 2 fixed into ammonium while decreasing the fraction being oxidized to nitrite and nitrate. The consequences could include reduced supplies of oxidized nitrogen substrates to denitrifiers, lower levels of nitrate-supported new primary production, and expansion of the regenerated production system accompanied by shifts in current phytoplankton communities. The phosphorus and silicon cycles seem less likely to be directly affected by enhanced CO 2 conditions, but will undoubtedly respond indirectly to changing carbon and nitrogen biogeochemistry. A review of culture experiments that examined the effects of increased CO 2 on elemental ratios of phytoplankton suggests that for most cyanobacteria and eukaryotes, C:N and N:P ratios will either remain at Redfield values or increase substantially. Natural plankton community CO 2 manipulation experiments show much more mixed outcomes, with both increases and decreases in C:N and N:P ratios reported at future CO 2 levels. We conclude our review with projections of overall trends in the cycles of nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon over the next century as they respond to the steady accumulation of fossil-fuel-derived CO 2 in a rapidly changing ocean...|$|R
