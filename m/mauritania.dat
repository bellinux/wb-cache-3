5|$|Nouakchott was a tiny, {{fortified}} {{fishing village}} (ksar) in pre-colonial times and under French rule. As <b>Mauritania</b> prepared for independence, it lacked a capital {{city and the}} area of present-day Nouakchott was chosen by Moktar Ould Daddah and his advisors. Ould Daddah desired for the new capital to be a symbol of modernity and national unity which ruled out existing cities or towns in the interior. The village {{was selected as the}} capital city for its central location between Saint-Louis, Senegal, the city from which the colony of <b>Mauritania</b> was governed, and Nouadhibou. Its location also meant that it avoided the sensitive issue of whether the capital was built in an area dominated by the Arab-descended Moors or Black Africans.|$|E

5|$|Addax {{are easy}} to hunt due to their slow movements.

Other threats include chronic droughts in the deserts, habitat destruction due to more human settlements and agriculture.

5|$|Nouakchott was a {{small village}} of little {{importance}} until 1958, when it {{was chosen as the}} capital of the nascent nation of <b>Mauritania.</b> It was designed and built to accommodate 15,000 people, but droughts and increasing desertification since the 1970s have displaced a vast number of Mauritanians who resettled in Nouakchott. This caused massive urban growth and overcrowding, with the city having an official population of just under a million as of 2013. The resettled population inhabited slum areas under poor conditions, but the living conditions of a portion of these inhabitants have since been ameliorated.|$|E
