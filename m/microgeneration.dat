25|$|Policymakers were {{accustomed}} to an energy system based on big, centralised projects like nuclear or gas-fired power stations. A change of mindsets and incentives are bringing <b>microgeneration</b> into the mainstream. Planning regulations may also require streamlining to facilitate the retrofitting of microgenerating facilities onto homes and buildings.|$|E
25|$|<b>Microgeneration</b> {{technologies}} include small-scale wind turbines, micro hydro, solar PV systems, microbial fuel cells, ground source heat pumps, and micro combined {{heat and}} power installations. These technologies are often combined {{to form a}} hybrid power solution that can offer superior performance and lower cost than a system based on one generator.|$|E
25|$|Dissipation {{of waste}} heat is {{especially}} complicated because the coolant temperature is kept {{as low as}} possible to maximize thermal efficiency. This increases the size of the radiators, which can make packaging difficult. Along with materials cost, this {{has been one of the}} factors limiting the adoption of Stirling engines as automotive prime movers. For other applications such as ship propulsion and stationary <b>microgeneration</b> systems using combined heat and power (CHP) high power density is not required.|$|E
25|$|It is envisaged that {{achieving}} {{the aim of}} a 2000-watt society will require, amongst other measures, a complete reinvestment in the country's capital assets; refurbishment of the nation's building stock {{to bring it up}} to low energy building standards; significant improvements in the efficiency of road transport, aviation and energy-intensive material use; the possible introduction of high-speed maglev trains; the use of renewable energy sources, district heating, <b>microgeneration</b> and related technologies; and a refocusing of research into new priority areas.|$|E
25|$|Before {{widespread}} {{power distribution}} from central stations, many factories, large hotels, apartment and office buildings {{had their own}} power generation. Often this was economically attractive because the exhaust steam {{could be used for}} building and industrial process heat, which today is known as cogeneration or combined heat and power (CHP). Most self-generated power became uneconomical as power prices fell. As late as the early 20th century, isolated power systems greatly outnumbered central stations. Cogeneration is still commonly practiced in many industries that use large amounts of both steam and power, such as pulp and paper, chemicals and refining. The continued use of private electric generators is called <b>microgeneration.</b>|$|E
25|$|In December 2014, the Polish {{government}} {{will vote on}} a bill which calls for <b>microgeneration,</b> as well as large scale wind farms in the Baltic Sea {{as a solution to}} cut back on co2 emissions from the country's coal plants as well as to reduce Polish dependence on Russian gas. Under the terms of the new bill, individuals and small businesses which generate up to 40kW of 'green' energy will receive 100% of market price for any electricity they feed back into the grid, and businesses who set up large-scale offshore wind farms in the Baltic will be eligible for subsidization by the state. Costs of implementing these new policies will be offset by {{the creation of a new}} tax on non-sustainable energy use.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Microgeneration</b> can {{dynamically}} {{balance the}} {{supply and demand}} for electric power, by producing more power during periods of high demand and high grid prices, and less power during periods of low demand and low grid prices. [...] This [...] "hybridized grid" [...] allows both <b>microgeneration</b> systems and large power plants to operate with greater energy efficiency and cost effectiveness than either could alone.|$|E
2500|$|Depending on the set-up chosen (financial recompensation scheme, power plant, extra equipment), prices may vary. According to Practical Action, <b>microgeneration</b> at home {{which uses}} {{the latest in}} cost saving-technology (wiring harnesses, ready boards, cheap DIY-power plants, e.g. DIY wind turbines) the {{household}} expenditure can be extremely low-cost. In fact, Practical Action mentions that many households in farming communities {{in the developing world}} spend less than $1 for electricity per month[...] However, if matters are handled less economically (using more commercial systems/approaches), costs will be dramatically higher. In most cases however, financial advantage will still be done using <b>microgeneration</b> on renewable power plants; often in the range of 50-90% [...] as local production has no electricity transportation losses on long distance power lines or energy losses from the Joule effect in transformers where in general 8-15% of the energy is lost.|$|E
2500|$|The United States has {{inconsistent}} {{energy generation}} policies across its 50 states. State energy policies and laws may vary significantly with location. Some states have imposed requirements on utilities {{that a certain}} percentage of total power generation be from renewable sources. [...] For this purpose, renewable sources include wind, hydroelectric, and solar power whether from large or <b>microgeneration</b> projects. [...] Further, in some areas transferrable [...] "renewable source energy" [...] credits are needed by power companies to meet these mandates. As a result, in some portions of the United States, power companies will pay a portion of the cost of renewable source <b>microgeneration</b> projects in their service areas. These rebates are in addition to any Federal or State renewable-energy income-tax credits that may be applicable. [...] In other areas, such rebates may differ or may not be available.|$|E
2500|$|Usually, in <b>microgeneration</b> {{for homes}} in the {{developing}} world, prefabricated house-wiring systems (as wiring harnesses or prefabricated distribution units) are used instead [...] Simplified house-wiring boxes and cables, known as wiring harnesses, can simply be bought and mounted into the building without requiring much knowledge about the wiring itself. As such, even people without technical expertise are able to install them. In addition, they are also comparatively cheap and offer safety advantages.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Microgeneration</b> is the {{small-scale}} {{generation of}} heat and electric power by individuals, small businesses and communities to meet their own needs, as alternatives or supplements to traditional centralized grid-connected power. [...] Although this may be motivated by practical considerations, such as unreliable grid power or long distance from the electrical grid, the term is mainly used currently for environmentally conscious approaches that aspire to zero or low-carbon footprints or cost reduction. It differs from micropower {{in that it is}} principally concerned with fixed power plants rather than for use with mobile devices.|$|E
2500|$|The UK Government {{published}} its <b>Microgeneration</b> Strategy in March 2006, {{although it}} {{was seen as a}} disappointment by many commentators. In contrast, the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 has been viewed as a positive step. To replace earlier schemes, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) launched the Low Carbon Buildings Programme in April 2006, which provided grants to individuals, communities and businesses wishing to invest in microgenerating technologies. These schemes have been replaced in turn by new proposals from the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) for clean energy cashback via Feed-In Tariffs [...] for generating electricity from April 2010 and the Renewable Heat Incentive [...] for generating renewable heat from 28 November 2011.|$|E
2500|$|ZEBs harvest {{available}} energy {{to meet their}} electricity and heating or cooling needs. In the case of individual houses, various <b>microgeneration</b> technologies {{may be used to}} provide heat and electricity to the building, [...] using solar cells or wind turbines for electricity, and biofuels or solar thermal collectors linked to a seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) for space heating. An STES can also be used for summer cooling by storing the cold of winter underground. To cope with fluctuations in demand, zero energy buildings are frequently connected to the electricity grid, export electricity to the grid when there is a surplus, and drawing electricity when not enough electricity is being produced. Other buildings may be fully autonomous.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Microgeneration</b> {{technologies}} {{are seen as}} having considerable potential by the Government. However, the <b>microgeneration</b> strategy launched in March 2006 {{was seen as a}} disappointment by many commentators. <b>Microgeneration</b> involves the local production of electricity by homes and businesses from low-energy sources including small scale wind turbines, and solar electricity installations. The Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 is expected to boost the number of <b>microgeneration</b> installations, however, funding for grants under the Low Carbon Building Programme is proving insufficient to meet demand with funds for March 2007 being spent in 75 minutes.FiTs (Feed-in-Tariffs, aka [...] "Clean Energy Cashback") were introduced from 1 April 2010 to support <b>microgeneration</b> of electricity. The Renewable Heat Incentive was introduced from 28 November 2011 to support <b>microgeneration</b> of heat from ground source heat pumps, solar thermal panels and biomass boilers, but only for non-domestic dwellings. The Government has plans to extend the RHI to domestic dwellings in 2013. The delay of introducing the RHI for renewable heat long after the subsidy for renewable electricity was introduced has dealt a savage blow to the renewable heat industries.|$|E
