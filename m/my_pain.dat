25|$|According to the Hebrew Bible, Benjamin's name arose when Jacob {{deliberately}} corrupted {{the name}} Benoni, the original name of Benjamin, since Benoni was {{an allusion to}} Rachel's dying just after she had given birth, as it means son of <b>my</b> <b>pain.</b> Textual scholars regard these two names as fragments of naming narratives coming from different sources - one being the Jahwist and the other being the Elohist.|$|E

25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away <b>my</b> <b>pain</b> every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

500|$|For the {{additional}} ending and credits of Type-0 HD, {{a new song}} titled [...] was commissioned by Tabata. Ishimoto created five different songs, with [...] "Utakata" [...] being Tabata's final choice. As Tabata wanted the song to have a Japanese style, Ishimoto wrote the lyrics in archaic Japanese, though he originally wanted to write the lyrics in English. It was created and recorded by a four-person team: Ishimoto composed the music, while singer Chris Ito wrote and sang the lyrics. The other two, T$UYO$HI and ZAX, were former members of alternate rock band Pay Money to <b>My</b> <b>Pain</b> and performed on bass guitar, and drums respectively. The song was first heard in the final Japanese trailer for Type-0 HD.|$|E

500|$|Poet Gerald Stern (born 1925), from Lawrenceville, New Jersey, was {{appointed}} as the state's first poet laureate by Governor Christine Todd Whitman on April 17, 2000. At {{the time of}} his appointment, Stern had been the author of twelve books of poetry and won the National Book Award for his 1998 collection This Time: New and Selected Poems. Stern had been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1991 for his collection Leaving Another Kingdom. Poet and Drew University literature professor Ross Gay described Stern's work, saying that his poems [...] "feel to me, often, a bit like that story, or rather, his manner of telling it: here is <b>my</b> <b>pain,</b> here is my sorrow, here is the song I’ve made of it." [...] Stern's last public reading as poet laureate was held on June 27, 2002 at a Summer Writer's Conference held at Rutgers Universitys Camden campus.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Liquor Store Blues" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised its reggae style and Damien Marley's {{appearance on the}} track, as well as, establishing comparisons to Mars' cocaine bust in Vegas as the song arrived shortly after the event aforementioned. The song peaked at number 97 on the Canadian Hot 100 and Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100, {{a component of the}} Billboard Hot 100, by peaking at number 105. The music video, directed by Jake Summer, was released on March 8, 2011 and features Bruno Mars and Damien Marley singing together with a colorful background and [...] "acid-trip" [...] visual effects, during the whole video. The song was performed many times during Mars' debut world tour, The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour (2010-2012), as the ninth track on its set list. During the 2016 Grammy Awards, Mars had a flask, filled with a drink, to [...] "get some winners drunk". The bottle is engraved with the lyrics, [...] "One shot for <b>my</b> <b>pain,</b> one drag for my sorrow" [...] from the song.|$|E
500|$|... "Liquor Store Blues" [...] was {{described}} as a [...] "melodious boom-box midtempo" [...] borrowing [...] "heavily from roots reggae". It is heavily influenced by dub music and has a moderate reggae tempo. Its composition has been compared to his previous project with Travis McCoy on [...] "Billionaire" [...] and Sublime's work, as well as, a [...] "Michael Jackson-meets-Bedouin Soundclash" [...] According to the digital sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing, the song was composed in common time and in the key of C# minor with a tempo of 144 beats per minute. Mars' and Marley's vocals range spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of C6. The track is three minutes and fifty nine seconds. The song's lyrics describe feelings of [...] "pain" [...] and [...] "sorrow", using alcohol as method to flee [...] "bad fortune in an odd foreshadowing of events". In the end, hope is found by [...] "getting messed up today" [...] since on the following day everything will be fine. Tyrone S. Reid from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer considered that the record explores addiction in a [...] "wonderfully, if humorously" [...] way ("I take one shot for <b>my</b> <b>pain,</b> one drag for my sorrow/Get messed up today, I’ll be okay tomorrow").|$|E

500|$|Over ominous keys, a {{keyboard}} opening and a repeating drum loop {{in the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her cards on the table, [...] "I told you how you hurt me, baby / But you don't care / Now I'm crying and deserted, baby / But you don't care / Ain't nobody tell me this is love / You're immune to all <b>my</b> <b>pain</b> / I need {{you to tell me}} this love / You don't care, well, that's OK". While singing the first and second verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you knew your power / you made me cry / And now every time our love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E
500|$|A teaser for [...] "Artpop" [...] was previewed {{as part of}} snippets {{from the}} parent album until its final release on November 11, 2013. A [...] "not safe for work" [...] short film, An Artpop Film Starring Lady Gaga, set to the song was {{released}} as promotion for the album, on November 20, 2013. Shot by Dutch fashion photographer duo Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, the video consisted of the material that Gaga created with them as promotion leading to Artpop. The video begins with a nude Gaga uttering a monologue: [...] "This album is a celebration. <b>My</b> <b>pain</b> exploding in electronic music. It's heavy, but after I listen to it I feel happy again. I feel lighter." [...] Following these are the black-and-white promotional scenes from Artpop campaign announcement, the music video for the first single [...] "Applause", the nude images for her interview with V magazine and the artwork for promotional single, [...] "Dope". Gaga shows a range of emotion in the film, including caressing a mannequin and applying dirt on her body, {{but most of the}} time she simply stares towards the camera. Zayda Rivera from New York Daily News expressed her difficulty in understanding the film, but added that [...] "hypnotic musical backdrop of her single 'Artpop' perfectly matches the artsy, bewildering and even disturbing images that run through the fast and slow editing." [...] Gaga admitted that she had performed for 12hours while making the film.|$|E

Tebbit later said: [...] "I don't think my reaction was extreme at all. I placed my hand on the drum so I could diminish the noise and asked the drummer what was going on and got a rap on the knuckles for <b>my</b> <b>pain.</b> I was then barged by the dragon. I barged it back and might have done something like kick it. I wasn't sure how to deal with it. I've never been barged by a dragon before". A local Conservative town councillor, Mr Chung, visited Tebbit the day after the incident and received an apology. Chung said: [...] "I said his actions were upsetting. He apologised. He only then understood what he had done".|$|E
