While one deals with very small biological specimens like single cells or molecules, a reduced trapping volume is desirable, which would ideally be provided by a near field trap. Near field trapping employs the evanescent field to manipulate microparticles, and hence reduces the axial trapping volume down to tens of nanometres. Although a nano-aperture and a metallic tip have been proposed to perform near-field trapping and manipulation but these mechanisms have not been experimentally confirmed because these they are located {{too close to the}} sample. We have recently reported on a new near-field trapping method based on the focused evanescent spot.

40|$|A {{technological}} {{revolution is}} occurring {{in the field of}} fiber lasers. Over the past two years, the level of power has increased from approx. 100 watts to nearly 1 kilowatt. We are developing a novel fiber laser system, which is a satellite-based LIDAR transmitter of multi-lines. The system is made of a hollow fiber filled with micro-spheres doped with lasing materials. Each sphere has its inherent optical cavity, which makes the system a cavity free and in the same time, emits multi-laser lines for simultaneous multi-task operations. The system is also rugged, compact, lightweight, and durable. Our earlier studies on micro-spheres doped with different laser dyes demonstrated the emission of extremely fine laser lines of less than 3 A line-width, which are of interest for spectroscopic applications, sensing, imaging, and optical communications. Individual dye-doped micro-spheres demonstrated a lasing resonance peaks phenomenon in their fluorescence spectra of linear and nonlinear features that do not exist in the bulk dye solutions. Each individual micro-sphere acts as a laser system with inherent cavity, where the fluorescence line suffers multiple internal reflections within the micro-sphere and gains enough energy to become a laser line. Such resonance peaks are dependent on the sphere's morphology, size, shape, and its refractive index. These resonance peaks are named structural resonance, whispering modes or whispering gallery modes, creeping waves, circumferential waves, surfaces modes, and virtual modes. All of these names refer to the same phenomenon of <b>morphology</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>resonance</b> (MDR), which has already been described and predicted precisely by electromagnetic theory and Lorentz-Mie theory since 1908. The resonance peaks become more obvious when the particle size approaches and exceeds the wavelength of the laser used and the relative index of the particle is greater than that of the surrounding medium.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental {{study on the}} optical trapping and propulsion of latex, gold aggregate and colloidal gold particles with average radius of 1. 5 µm, 250 nm and 10 nm respectively, in the evanescent region of an illuminated ion-exchange channel waveguide is documented in this thesis. Optimisation of light-induced forces exerted on a particle on a waveguide relies on two important factors, firstly a maximisation of the intensity and intensity gradient present in the guide-cover interface and secondly, an optimisation of the polarizability of a particle. To this end, a transcendental equation was established and was used to generate design curves for the normalised waveguide thickness required for achieving a maximum gradient force on the guide-cover interface of a waveguide for {{a specific set of}} indices. A study based on Mie theory for the investigation of <b>morphology</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>resonance</b> exhibited by a spherical particle is described. The dependence of resonances on particle radius, index of the sphere with respect to the surrounding medium, absorption, plasmon resonance and symmetry of the incident beam has been investigated. In particular, a simplification of the Mie model was carried out to derive Rayleigh expressions of cross sections from which particle polarizability originates. The validity of the Rayleigh model was assessed with respect to the limiting particle radius. Based on a semi-classical approach, a derivation of light-induced forces applying to a Rayleigh sphere in the cover region of a waveguide is detailed. The three main optical force components produced are (i) a forward scattering and absorption force due to the intensity of the incident radiation which accounts for propulsion of particles, (ii) a transverse gradient force due to an intensity gradient generated by a decaying evanescent field and finally (iii) a lateral gradient force which arises from the near-Gaussian intensity distribution on a channel waveguide. A comparison of the relative magnitude of each component is described, with additional forces due to gravity, buoyancy and Brownian motion studied. Factors affecting the propulsion of a gold nanoparticle were investigated. It was shown that the particle velocity is linearly dependent upon the waveguide modal power, increases with a wavelength closer to plasmon resonance {{in the case of a}} Rayleigh gold particle, is stronger for TM polarized light, increases with a larger change in the waveguide refractive index and is maximum for a minimum modesize. For the first time, under the action of light-induced forces generated on the surface of an optical waveguide, colloidal gold particles are propelled in the direction of wave propagation reaching at a maximum velocity of 10 µm/s for a modal power of 500 mW at lambda= 1. 047 µm.

40|$|In recent times, {{near-field}} {{optical microscopy}} has received increasing attention {{for its ability}} to obtain high-resolution images beyond the diffraction limit. Near-field optical microscopy is achieved via the positioning and manipulation of a probe on a scale less than the wavelength of the incident light. Despite many variations in the mechanical design of near-field optical microscopes almost all rely on direct mechanical access of a cantilever or a derivative form to probe the sample. This constricts the study to surface examinations in simple sample environments. Distance regulation between the sample surface and the delicate probe requires its own feedback mechanism. Determination of feedback is achieved through monitoring the shift of resonance of one arm of a 'tuning fork', which is caused by the interaction of the probes tip with the Van der Waals force. Van der Waals force emanates from atom-atom interaction {{at the top of the}} sample surface. Environmental contamination of the sample surface with additional molecules such as water makes accurate measurement of these forces particularly challenging. The near-field study of living biological material is extremely difficult as an aqueous environment is required for its extended survival. Probe-sample interactions within an aqueous environment that result in strong detectable signal is a challenging problem that receives considerable attention and is a focus of this thesis. In order to increase the detectible signal a localised field enhancement in the probing region is required. The excitation of an optically resonant probe by <b>morphology</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>resonance</b> (MDR) provides a strong localised field enhancement. Efficient MDR excitation requires important coupling conditions be met, of which the localisation of the incident excitation is a critical factor. Evanescent coupling by frustrated total internal reflection to a MDR microcavity provides an ideal method for localised excitation. However it has severe drawbacks if the probe is to be manipulated in a scanning process. Tightly focusing the incident illumination by a high numerical aperture objective lens provides the degree of freedom to enable both MDR excitation and remote manipulation. Two-photon nonlinear excitation is shown to couple efficiently to MDR modes due to the high spatial localisation of the incident excitation in three-dimensions. The dependence of incident excitation localisation by high numerical aperture objective on MDR efficiency is thoroughly examined in this thesis. The excitation of MDR can be enhanced by up to 10 times with the localisation of the incident illumination from the centre of the microcavity to its perimeter. Illuminating through a high numerical aperture objective enables the remote noninvasive manipulation of a microcavity probe by laser trapping. The transfer of photon momentum from the reflection and refraction of the trapping beam is sufficient enough to exert piconewtons of force on a trapped particle. This allows the particle to be held and scanned in a predictable fashion in all three-dimensions. Optical trapping removes the need for invasive mechanical access to the sample surface and provides a means of remote distance regulation between the trapped probe and the sample. The femtosecond pulsed beam utilised in this thesis allows the simultaneous induction of two-photon excitation and laser trapping. It is found in this thesis that a MDR microcavity can be excited and translated in an efficient manner. The application of this technique to laser trapped near-field microscopy and single molecule detection is of particular interest. Monitoring the response of the MDR signal as it is scanned over a sample object enables a near-field image to be built up. As the enhanced evanescent field from the propagation of MDR modes around a microcavity interacts with different parts of the sample, a measurable difference in energy leakage from the cavity modes occurs. The definitive spectral properties of MDR enables a multidimensional approach to imaging and sensing, a focus of this thesis. Examining the spectral modality of the MDR signal can lead to a contrast enhancement in laser trapped imaging. Observing a single MDR mode during the scanning process can increase the image contrast by up to 1 : 23 times compared to that of the integrated MDR fluorescence spectrum. The work presented in this thesis leads to the possibility of two-photon fluorescence excitation of MDR in combination with laser trapping becoming a valuable tool in near- field imaging, sensing and single molecule detection in vivo. It has been demonstrated that particle scanned, two-photon fluorescence excitation of MDR, by laser trapping 'tweezers' can provide a contrast enhancement and multiple imaging modalities. The spectral imaging modality has particular benefits for image contrast enhancements...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{trapping}} {{techniques have}} become an important and irreplaceable tool in many research disciplines for reaching non-invasively into the microscopic world and to manipulate, cut, assemble and transform micro-objects with nanometer precision and sub-micrometer resolution. Further advances in optical trapping techniques promise {{to bridge the gap}} and bring together the macroscopic world and experimental techniques and applications of Microsystems in areas of physics, chemistry and biology. In order to understand the optical trapping process and to improve and tailor experimental techniques and applications in a variety of scientific disciplines, an accurate knowledge of trapping forces exerted on particles and their dependency on environmental and morphological factors is of crucial importance. Furthermore, the recent trend in novel laser trapping experiments sees the use of complex laser beams in trapping arrangements for achieving more controllable laser trapping techniques. Focusing of such beams with a high numerical aperture (NA) objective required for efficient trapping leads to a complicated amplitude, phase and polarisation distributions of an electromagnetic field in the focal region. Current optical trapping models based on ray optics theory and the Gaussian beam approximation are inadequate to deal with such a focal complexity. Novel applications of the laser trapping such as the particle-trapped scanning near field optical microscopy (SNOM) and optical-trap nanometry techniques are currently investigated largely in the experimental sense or with approximated theoretical models. These applications are implemented using the efficient laser trapping with high NA and evanescent wave illumination of the sample for high resolution sensing. The proper study of these novel laser trapping applications and the potential benefits of implementation of these applications with complex laser beams requires an exact physical model for the laser trapping process and a nanometric sensing model for detection of evanescent wave scattering. This thesis is concerned with comprehensive and rigorous modelling and characterisation of the trapping process of spherical dielectric particles implemented using far-field and near-field optical trapping modalities. Two types of incident illuminations are considered, the plane wave illumination and the doughnut beam illumination of various topological charges. The doughnut beams represent one class of complex laser beams. However, our optical trapping model presented in this thesis is in no way restricted to this type of incident illumination, but is equally applicable to other types of complex laser beam illuminations. Furthermore, the thesis is concerned with development of a physical model for nanometric sensing, which is of great importance for optical trapping systems that utilise evanescent field illumination for achieving high resolution position monitoring and imaging. The nanometric sensing model, describing the conversion of evanescent photons into propagating photons, is realised using an analytical approach to evanescent wave scattering by a microscopic particle. The effects of an interface at which the evanescent wave is generated are included by considering the scattered field reflection from the interface. Collection and imaging of the resultant scattered field by a high numerical aperture objective is described using vectorial diffraction theory. Using our sensing model, we have investigated the dependence of the scattering on the particle size and refractive index, the effects of the interface on the scattering cross-section, <b>morphology</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>resonance</b> effects associated with the scattering process, and the effects of the incident angle of a laser beam undergoing total internal reflection to generate an evanescent field. Furthermore, we have studied the detectability of the scattered signal using a wide area detector and a pinhole detector. A good agreement between our experimental measurements of the focal intensity distribution in the back focal region of the collecting objective and the theoretical predictions confirm the validity of our approach. The optical trapping model is implemented using a rigorous vectorial diffraction theory for characterisation of the electromagnetic field distribution in the focal region of a high NA objective. It is an exact model capable of considering arbitrary amplitude, phase and polarisation of the incident laser beam as well as apodisation functions of the focusing objective. The interaction of a particle with the complex focused field is described by an extension of the classical plane wave Lorentz-Mie theory with the expansion of the incident field requiring numerical integration of finite surface integrals only. The net force exerted on the particle is then determined using the Maxwell stress tensor approach. Using the optical trapping model one can consider the laser trapping process in the far-field of the focusing objective, also known as the far-field trapping, and the laser trapping achieved by focused evanescent field, i. e. near-field optical trapping. Investigations of far-field laser trapping show that spherical aberration plays {{a significant role in the}} trapping process if a refractive index mismatch exists between the objective immersion and particle suspension media. An optical trap efficiency is severely degraded under the presence of spherical aberration. However, our study shows that the spherical aberration effect can be successfully dealt with using our optical trapping model. Theoretical investigations of the trapping process achieved using an obstructed laser beam indicate that the transverse trapping efficiency decreases rapidly with increasing size of the obstruction, unlike the trend predicted using a ray optics model. These theoretical investigations are in a good agreement with our experimentally observed results. Far-field optical trapping with complex doughnut laser beams leads to reduced lifting force for small dielectric particles, compared with plane wave illumination, while for large particles it is relatively unchanged. A slight advantage of using a doughnut laser beam over plane wave illumination for far-field trapping of large dielectric particles manifests in a higher forward axial trapping efficiency, which increases for increasing doughnut beam topological charge. It is indicated that the maximal transverse trapping efficiency decreases for reducing particle size and that the rate of decrease is higher for doughnut beam illumination, compared with plane wave illumination, which has been confirmed by experimental measurements. A near-field trapping modality is investigated by considering a central obstruction placed before the focusing objective so that the obstruction size corresponds to the minimum convergence angle larger than the critical angle. This implies that the portion of the incident wave that is passed through the high numerical aperture objective satisfies the total internal reflection condition at the surface of the coverslip, so that only a focused evanescent field is present in the particle suspension medium. Interaction of this focused near-field with a dielectric micro-particle is described and investigated using our optical trapping model with a central obstruction. Our investigation shows that the maximal backward axial trapping efficiency or the lifting force is comparable to that achieved by the far-field trapping under similar conditions for either plane wave illumination or complex doughnut beam illumination. The dependence of the maximal axial trapping efficiency on the particle size is nearly linear for near-field trapping with focused evanescent wave illumination in the Mie size regime, unlike that achieved using the far-field trapping technique...|$|E

The Mie formulation for homogeneous spheres is generalized to handle core/shell systems and multiple concentric layers {{in a manner that}} exploits an analogy with stratified planar systems, thereby allowing concentric multi-layered structures to be treated as photonic bandgap (PBG) materials. Representative results from a Mie code employing this analogy demonstrate that photonic bands arising from nearly free photon effects are easily observed in the backscattering, asymmetry parameter, and albedo for periodic quarter-wave concentric layers, though are not readily apparent in extinction spectra. Rather, the periodicity simply alters the scattering profile, enhancing the ratio of backscattering to forward scattering inside the bandgap, in direct analogy with planar quarter-wave multilayers.

40|$|Abstract A {{characteristic}} of femtosecond pulse scattering on small particles is the temporal {{separation of the}} pulses, {{which is due to}} the different optical path lengths through the particle. Therefore the particle converts the incident pulse in a train of pulses, with the pulse heights and temporal separation depending on particle size, refractive index and observation angle. Because of the temporal pulse separation, signal parts from different scattering orders are no longer coherent. Therefore interference structures, which are in the case of continuous illumination the cause of scattering lobes, disappear. The interference inside a single scattering order, as for the rainbow, exists as long as the pulses from different paths overlap. The detection does not require high temporal resolution but is time integrated. This offers the possibility to improve or extend techniques which are disturbed by additional scattering orders, as the rainbow technique for small particles. A second {{characteristic of}} femtosecond pulses is the broad electromagnetic spectrum of the illumination. For continuous laser illumination with one spectral line, a spherical particle generates optical resonances for various wavelength-diameter ratios (<b>morphology</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>resonances,</b> MDRs).

Shortly after the droplet has entered the observation channel the laser light scattered into the forward hemisphere is detected by a CCD camera. From the angular spacing of bright fringes in the intensity distribution of the scattered light the droplet size is determined. While the droplet is falling and evaporating the intensity of a part of the scattered light is detected by a photomultiplier. As the droplet is evaporating, its size is decreasing and <b>morphology</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>resonances</b> become visible in the temporal evolution of the intensity of the scattered light. From the time intervals between of the resonance peaks the evaporation rate is determined. On one side of the transparent observation channel a horizontal grid with transparent equidistant slits is posted. A second photomultiplier detects the scattered light, when the droplet pas ses the tansparent slits. From the output signal of this photomultiplier the droplet velocity is determined. These measurement techniques allow to monitor droplet size and velocity during the evaporation process. It is important, that the measurements start shortly after drople...|$|R
40|$|For light {{propagating}} in a dielectric waveguide, {{a part of}} {{the field}} extends into the cover medium. This evanescent tail can be used to manipulate microparticles provided that the refractive index of the particle is higher than that of the cover medium {{and the size of the}} particle is less than about 15 µm. The optical forces due to the evanescent field act to guide the particle along the waveguide. The use of waveguides to trap particles combines the possibilities of optical tweezers with the techniques employed in integrated optics [1]. We have used counter-propagating waves from a high-power laser to trap particles suspended in water and on the surface of a waveguide. This makes it possible to move a particle both ways and hold it at a fixed position. We have then combined the light from the high-power laser (1083 nm) with the light from a tunable laser (957 - 1000 nm) and measured the light scattered by the particle as function of the wavelength (fig. 1). This gives the <b>morphology</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>resonances</b> (MDRs) of the particle. Optical microsphere resonators, with their exceptionally low optical losses and high Q-factors, are attracting a lot of interest in integrated optics and related fields. Not being accessible by free-space beams, modes of a microsphere resonator require near-field coupler devices. This method of trapping the particle and at the same time excite the MDRs, is new. The first results are promising, but the measured Q-values are low (< 400) and improvements are thus necessary to fully exploit the microresonators...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was focused on}} developing morphology-dependent stimulated raman scattering (MDSRS) spectroscopy as an analytic optical imaging technique. MDSRS uses the cavity modes (called <b>morphology</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>resonances,</b> MDRs) associated with axisymmetric dielectric microstructures to generate nonlinear optical signals. Since different cavity modes span different regions inside the microstructure, it becomes possible to generate location-specific spectra. The information gotten from MDSRS imaging experiments is analogous with that generated from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in that spatial variations in chemical composition and molecular configuration within a structure can be mapped out. The authors demonstrated that MDSRS imaging is feasible and is free from nonlinear artifact. They did this by measuring the molecular structure variations that {{are present in the}} interfaces of 180 {micro}m dia. charged water droplets. The 4 publications that resulted from these studies are attached. From a chemical perspective a water droplet is, however, a simple thing. Will it be possible to use MDSRS imaging to study more complex systems such as combusting fuel droplets, layered polymer or glass fibers, or biological cells? The long-term goal of the {{research was}} to answer this question. The answer they have come up with is yes and no. The results on nitrate aerosols show {{that it is possible to}} do imaging studies on optically non-absorbing, ion containing systems, but that the ultimate sensitivity is dictated by ion concentration. hence systems containing large quantities of mobile ions will be difficult to look at, so this essentially eliminates being able to look at biological samples in situ. But on the positive side, organic systems, such as layered polymer and glass fibers, and combusting organic fuel droplets can be looked at with MDSRS imaging...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the time {{integrated}} detection of scattered femtosecond laser pulses, and illumination from a continuous wave semiconductor laser source with optical feedback and adaptable coherence length, is investigated for small particles. In this context the scattering function for small particles is numerically advanced. The angular distribution of local maxima of the scattering function is presented for small particles under ultrashort pulse illumination. The position of local maxima relating to scattering angle, particle size and refractive index is calculated with Fourier-Lorenz-Mie theory. Moreover, {{an estimate of}} the sensitivity of the scattering function to non-sphericity is presented, utilizing general Lorenz-Mie theory. For ultrashort pulse illumination the maxima of the supernumerary bows of the primary rainbow, which hold information on particle size and refractive index, are freed from disturbing interferences with reflection order and higher refractive order contributions. The presented results indicate the feasibility of precise in-situ measurements with Rainbow refractometry for highly spherical small particles with compact and cost-efficient sources of illumination and quantify the pulse duration or coherence length for the desired lower size range, which is essential information for future experimental studies. Moreover, a substantial reduction of <b>morphology</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>resonances</b> for microscopic water droplets is successfully demonstrated. For the first time, an electrodynamic Paul trap with novel geometry is applied to successfully observe the scattering of femtosecond laser pulses on small water droplets not only during a short period of milliseconds as in a droplet stream, but also over the temporal evolution of an evaporating droplet. Beyond Rainbow refractometry, the acquired results indicate the feasibility of new measurement techniques and the significant enhancement of existing methods. Under the aspect of the separation of scattering orders, interferometric particle imaging (IPI) is enhanceable by fitting the coherence length to the angle of detection. Illumination of small particles with femtosecond laser pulses is shown to facilitate direct size measurement from focused images of a thin spray by measurement of the intensity ratio of specific glare points on individual particles. Moreover, the smoothing of the diameter-intensity function for small particles allows for more precise determination of the Sauter mean diameter in the named size range. Due to the introduction of coherence length as a variable parameter for small particle characterization, the advantages of time integrated detection of femtosecond laser pulses scattered by small particles are underscored by the outlook of utilizing spatially compact and cost-efficient semiconductor laser devices with the important benefit of adjustable coherence length...|$|R
