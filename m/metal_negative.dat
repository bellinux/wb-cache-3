The development of the dendrite length shows the linearity with the square root of time, and this slope changes just after the Li+ ion is depleted at the electrode surface.

The lithium <b>metal</b> <b>negative</b> electrode is key to applying these new battery technologies. However, the problems of lithium dendrite growth and low Coulombic efficiency have proven to be difficult challenges to overcome.

All solid-state batteries comprising lithium <b>metal</b> <b>negative</b> electrode and lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4) composite positive electrode were assembled. A polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (SEO) copolymer doped with a lithium salt was used as the electrolyte. After cycling the batteries, the reason for capacity fade and failure was determined by imaging the batteries using synchrotron hard X-ray microtomography. These experiments revealed partial delamination of the lithium foil and the block copolymer electrolyte layer. The void volume between the foil and electrolyte layer obtained after 40 to 90 cycles is comparable to volume change in the battery during one cycle. A simple model to account for the effect of delamination on current density in the battery is presented. Capacity fade and battery failures observed in our experiments are consistent with this model. No evidence of lithium dendrite formation was found. In contrast, cycled lithium-lithium symmetric cells with the same polymer electrolyte at the same current density failed due to dendrite formation. No evidence of delamination was found in these cells...|$|E
40|$|Lithium metal is the ‘Holy Grail’ {{negative}} electrode of rechargeable batteries {{as it has}} the highest theoretical specific capacity and lowest electrochemical potential among all candidates. Next generation high capacity, high energy density battery systems, like lithium sulfur batteries, lithium air batteries, can never reach the level of commercialization without a safe and reliable lithium metal anode. Unfortunately, lithium metal cannot yet be safely implemented in commercial battery packs because of dendrite growth. Dendrite growth of these anode materials can cause short circuit within the battery, leading to dangerous fire and explosion in practical battery working conditions.

40|$|In this thesis, {{electrode}} binders {{as vital}} {{components in the}} fabrication of composite electrodes for lithium-ion (LIB) and lithium-sulfur batteries (LiSB) have been investigated. Poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVdF) was studied as binder for sulfur-carbon positive electrodes {{by a combination of}} galvanostatic cycling and nitrogen absorption. Poor binder swelling in the electrolyte and pore blocking in the porous carbon were identified as origins of low discharge capacity, rendering PVdF-based binders an unsuitable choice for LiSBs. More promising candidates are blends of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). It was found that these polymers interact with soluble lithium polysulfide intermediates generated during the cell reaction. They can increase the discharge capacity, while simultaneously improving the capacity retention and reducing the self-discharge of the LiSB. In conclusion, these binders improve the local electrolyte environment at the electrode interface. Graphite electrodes for LIBs are rendered considerably more stable in ‘aggressive’ electrolytes (a propylene carbonate rich formulation and an ether-based electrolyte) with the poorly swellable binders poly(sodium acrylate) (PAA-Na) and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC-Na). The higher interfacial impedance seen for the conventional PVdF binder suggests a protective polymer layer on the particles. By reducing the binder content, it was found that PAA-Na has a stronger affinity towards electrode components with high surface areas, which is attributed to a flexible polymer backbone and a higher density of functional groups. Lastly, a graphite electrode was combined with a sulfur electrode to yield a balanced graphite-sulfur cell. Due to a more stable electrode-electrolyte interface the self-discharge of this cell could be reduced and the cycle life was extended significantly. This example demonstrates the possible benefits of replacing the lithium <b>metal</b> <b>negative</b> electrode with an alternative electrode material...|$|E
40|$|Conjugated polymeryfullerene plastic {{solar cells}} of the first {{generation}} were consisting of two distinct layers, made of the donor polymer and of the acceptor fullerene, respectively, sandwiched between two metal contacts. By mixing the polymer and the fullerene components, thus replacing a single flat junction with an interpenetrating network bulk-heterojunction, the device efficiency was dramatically improved. As a further step to proceed with the development of plastic solar cells, we developed the bulk diffusion bilayer approach, allowing the creation of donor-acceptor diffused interfaces with less restrictions to the phase compatibility of the two components. For a novel series of fullerenes, the bulk diffusion bilayer approach is shown to yield devices with comparable efficiencies as the blend bulk heterojunction approach. Bulk-heterojunction devices show unusually high open circuit voltage (VOC) values. These values cannot be explained by the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) model that has been often used for organic light emitting diodes. In order to investigate the origin of the VOC in bulk-heterojunction plastic solar cells, we have prepared PPV based devices varying both the <b>metal</b> <b>negative</b> contact and the fullerene acceptor. Fullerene derivatives with varying acceptor strength, (i. e. the first reduction potential) were used as electron acceptors in bulk-heterojunction plastic solar cells produced with the blend as well as the diffusion bilayer approach. The open circuit voltage of the devices was found to correlate directly with the acceptor strength of the fullerenes, while it was rather insensitive to variations in the workfunction of the negative electrode metal. These results suggest that the quasi-Fermi level of the fullerene pins the Fermi level of the evaporated negative metal contact. ...|$|E

Abraham et al. (Abraham, K. M.; Jiang, Z. J. Electrochem.

The Li/O 2 battery redox couple has a theoretical specific energy of 5200 W h/kg and represents the ultimate, environmentally friendly electrochemical power source. In this work, we report {{for the first time}} the intimate role of electrolyte, in particular the role of ion conducting salts, in determining the reversibility and kinetics of oxygen reduction in nonaqueous electrolytes designed for such applications.
