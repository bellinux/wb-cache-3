50|$|<b>Metildigoxin</b> (INN, or medigoxin BAN, or methyldigoxin) is {{a cardiac}} glycoside, {{a type of}} drug {{that can be used}} in the {{treatment}} of congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). The substance is closely related to digoxin; it differs from the latter only by an O-methyl group on the terminal monosaccharide.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid UPLC/MS/MS method has been {{developed}} and validated {{for the analysis of}} digoxin and <b>metildigoxin</b> in whole blood. Samples were prepared by SPE extraction with Oasis HLB columns. Separation was achieved with an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T 3 column (2. 1 × 100; 1. 8 [*]μm), at 35 °C. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile (70 %) and ammonium formate 5 [*]mM (30 %). Total run time was 1. 5 [*]min operating at isocratic mode with a flow rate of 0. 3 [*]mL/min. Mass spectrometry detection was performed by positive mode electrospray, on the ammonium adducts with two transitions for each analyte and one for the IS (d 3 -digoxin). The method proved to be specific and linear over the range (0. 3 – 10) [*]ng/mL. This technique also showed high sensitivity with a 0. 09 [*]ng/mL LOD and a 0. 28 [*]ng/mL LOQ, for both substances. Percentage recovery ranged from 83 to 100 % for digoxin and from 62 to 94 % for <b>metildigoxin.</b> The intra- and interday precision CV were ≤ 10 %...|$|E
