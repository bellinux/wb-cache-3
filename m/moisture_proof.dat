Cellophane saw limited sales in the US at first since while it was waterproof, it was not <b>moisture</b> <b>proof</b> - it held water but was permeable to water vapor. This meant that it was unsuited to packaging products that required moisture proofing. DuPont hired chemist William Hale Charch, who spent three years developing a nitrocellulose lacquer that, when applied to Cellophane, made it <b>moisture</b> <b>proof.</b> Following the introduction of moisture-proof Cellophane in 1927, the material's sales tripled between 1928 and 1930, and in 1938, Cellophane accounted for 10% of DuPont's sales and 25% of its profits.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out during 2013 in {{selected}} districts of Sindh to identify the common storage methods that farmers used to store wheat and to identify the associated storage problems. The majority of the farmers were male, uneducated and their age range from 20 to 60 years. The average area of land under wheat crop was 5 acres and the average total production of wheat was 6500 kg out of which 2500 kg of wheat was available for storage by farmers for seed, home consumption and sell to the market when the prices are favourable. Wheat storage structures such as earthen bin, bamboo/straw bin, bulk covered method and room type structures are commonly used in these districts. These structures were not insect, rodent, fungi and <b>moisture</b> <b>proof.</b> They had various defects such as cracks, holes, leakages and structural failure in the roof, walls and floor of the structures because of poor strength of materials and inadequate design of structures. Other storage problems are loss of seed germination capacity, discoloration of the grain, and sprouting during storage. As {{a result of these}} problems about 10 - 40 % of the stored wheat grain is lost annually. An urgent need for an efficient storage system at the farmer level was identified to preserve quality and quantity of wheat at an acceptable level...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Villas {{built before}} 1960 {{represent}} around 45 % of the dwelling in Sweden. Since the average U-value in their walls is around 0, 5 W/m 2 K, {{there is a}} great concern to improve  these values. The Swedish government's goal is to reduce energy intensity in the country by 2020 by 20 % from 2008 ’s values. The aim {{of this study is to}} reach phase renovation proposals taking into account energy and moisture on houses consisting of standing shelves. With this, the authors wish to contribute and encourage renovation of existing villas, which in turn can lead to reduced energy consumption. Method: This work is based on a case study of a 1940 ’s wooden house located in Skillingaryd. Measurements and parameters have been taken in order to calculate the house's specific energy usage in the BV 2 analysis program. Document analyses and interviews have been used to get a deeper knowledge of existing conditions, and to suggest ways to utilise the material that the market offers nowadays. This should serve the purpose of creating as energy-efficient phase resolution as possible. Result: The study shows that an outer wall of a massive wooden house should keep a U-value of 0, 15 W/m 2 K to meet the specific energy consumption of 90 kWh/m 2 and year, when the other house is additional insulated. The study presents two refurbishment proposals supported by interviewed experts in the insulation and consulting industry. The first option leaves large parts of the old facade untouched, adding new insulation layers of the desired thickness. The second option advises to tear away all old panels into the shelf frame, thus re-building with new materials. Both proposals address the issue of how the facade should be refurbished in order to make it <b>moisture</b> <b>proof.</b> They mostly solve the problem by refurbishing it outwards and by eventually placing a vapor barrier for a maximum of one third in of the insulation. This vapor barrier may or may not be a watershed according to the experts. Some think it is unnecessary when the plank is considered sufficiently diffusion-proof; some believe that it will help to identify where a possible condensation might occur in the wall.   Consequences: The study shows that by means of additional insulation, BBR 24 recommended values ​​can be achieved for an exterior wall while keeping the façade <b>moisture</b> <b>proof.</b> One strength the study shows that the two reported renovation proposals achieve the same end result, although the interference on the facade varies in size. Therefore the authors of the above study recommend to tear down the old facade and build a new control wall with a finishing facade disc. This is when you face a vapor barrier on the façade with a vapor barrier that is laid on the old baselayer of the roof. Then a new roof construction could be built up with roof beams, shavings and roof tiles. As a result, a windy, yet proportional, construction can be created.   Restrictions: The study assumes that the entire house would be refurbished in order for the specific energy use to be possible. Furthermore, the work is based of a shelf shelter located at a particular geographical site. Due to this, the study also offers suggestions on wooden facades only.   Keyword: Plank body, Phase renovation, Specific energy use, diffusion, convection, U-value, air density...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{increased}} awareness of climate change and higher energy costs, well‐insulated buildings have become more common. Furthermore, the interests of using wood in building to produce more carbon dioxide‐efficient houses have increased. However, thicker thermal insulation in walls {{increases the risk of}} high relative humidity levels and the risk of mould‐related damage in Wood frame houses. In order to predict moisture damage {{it is important to have}} a properly verified, userfriendly and reliable calculation tool that can be used in the design phase. The first part of the thesis presents a blind method that can be used in order to verify heat and moisture calculation tools in a reliable manner. General results and findings from blind validations using a one‐dimensional transient heat and moisture calculation tool are summarized and presented. The comparisons include measurements and calculations of temperature and relative humidity and were carried out in Northern European climates. The thesis also presents important factors affecting the risk of mould growth in well‐insulated Wood frame walls. A parametric study is presented in which moisture‐critical positions in traditional Swedish wood frame designs in Northern European climates are investigated by using hygrothermal modeling. Traditional Swedish walls with insulation thicknesses of 220 mm are then compared to walls with thicker thermal insulation and alternative designs. In general the comparisons of measured and blindly calculated values show a good correlation. The results show that the studied tool can be used during the design phase to predict moisture risks. However, factors such as the influence of impaired temperature affecting the calculated RH have to be taken into account. There is also a need for developing outdoor climate boundary conditions that take into account critical periods and variations between different years. It has been found that there is a higher risk of moisture‐related damage in thicker insulated walls. However, this risk can be reduced by choosing more suitable designs in which well‐ventilated air gaps behind the claddings and exterior vapour‐permeable <b>moisture</b> <b>proof</b> thermal insulation boards are of great importance...|$|E
40|$|A manutenção da viabilidade de sementes por períodos mais ou menos longos está bastante relacionada com as condições em que elas são armazenadas. Temperatura e teor de umidade estão entre os fatores que mais afetam sua longevidade. O objetivo deste trabalho é o estudo da viabilidade e dormência de uva do {{cultivar}} Patrícia, armazenada durante 24 meses em dois tipos de recipientes - em vidro hermético e saco de papel - a temperaturas de 10, 20 e 30 °C, com dois diferentes teores iniciais de umidade. A porcentagem de sementes dormentes e viáveis foi determinada bimestralmente durante os primeiros 12 meses, e semestralmente nos períodos mais longos. O armazenamento não quebrou a dormência das sementes de uva em nenhuma das condições estudadas. Enquanto as sementes frescas mostraram melhor conservação a 10 °C quando embaladas em vidro hermético, sementes secas se conservaram melhor a 20 °C. Em saco de papel, foram poucas as diferenças encontradas entre os tratamentos, a não ser nos períodos finais do armazenamento, quando 20 °C se mostrou a pior temperatura de conservação. Dessa maneira, a dormência não foi alterada pelo armazenamento, nas condições estudadas, e a viabilidade foi bastante afetada tanto pelo tipo de embalagem como pela temperatura de armazenamento. Longevity {{of seeds}} {{is affected by}} the storage conditions, being temperature and seed moisture content the major factors to keep seeds viable.

Samples were taken every two months during the first 12 months and at 6 months intervals in the second year, to determine seed viability and dormancy level. Storage, in the studied conditions, did not alter dormancy levei of the seeds. When stored in hermetical conditions, fresh seeds (high moisture content) were viable for the longest periods, at 10 °C. Dry seeds in those conditions exhibited the longest period of viability at 20 °C. When seeds were stored in paper bags there were no marked differences among the treatments, except when storage was done for long periods. In this case, viability was first lost at 20 °C. In this way, dormancy level was not altered by storage, and seed longevity was significantly affected either by temperature or type of seed container used during storage...|$|E
40|$|Between 1965 and 1974, the Swedish Parliament {{decided to}} build one million dwellings, called Million Program. The million program {{buildings}} were erected with new, untried design solutions, in a short range of time, and at low cost. The residential buildings from that time are now greatly in need of renovation. The municipal housing company, Gavlegårdarna, renovates and improves the energy efficiency at some of it’s apartment buildings in the district Sätra, Gävle. One problem is {{how to make the}} basic design of the slab on ground more energy efficiency and <b>moisture</b> <b>proof.</b> The study covers four representative flooring types in the Gavlegårdarnas million program area in Sätra. This study aims to investigate and evaluate proven methods for adding insulation in the four floor types. Also to look for solutions by designing additional insulation to treat damp problems and improve energy efficiency in an economical way. Existing flooring types are to be examined to check for new solutions as well. The aim is to produce a number of measures to provide property owners with different energy efficiency solutions. Results of calculations show that the perimeter area of the slab is exposed to moisture problems, while the centre of it does not have any notable problems. According to calculations, improved floor types have U-values reduced by 31 % – 40 % depending on the insulation thickness and design. However, investments have a long payback period and this is sometimes not economically viable. When a redevelopment project is performed, it is beneficial to simultaneously add insulation. If investors promote sustainable development, reduced energy consumption by the proposed measures is viable, as advocated by the environmental goals set by Sweden and the EU.  Sveriges riksdag beslutade att det skulle byggas en miljon bostäder, så kallade miljonprogramshus, mellan åren 1965 och 1974.

40|$|Many Poaceae grasses form a {{symbiosis}} with Epichloë fungal endophytes. Initially {{a serious}} problem in agriculture due to their production of alkaloids toxic to livestock, endophyte strains were identified that were less toxic to livestock whilst also possessing advantageous traits, including insect deterrent alkaloids. Selection and transfer of these endophytes into elite grass cultivars has resulted in pastures with improved persistence with no, or reduced, livestock toxicosis. These novel associations are now successfully marketed in New Zealand (NZ), Australia, USA and South America. Epichloë species exhibit strong host specificity and the asexual form is exclusively vertically transmitted through maternal lines via the seed embryo. In New Zealand, the dominant commercially available agricultural associations are between perennial ryegrass and E. festucae var. lolii strains that rely on the production of peramine, epoxy-janthitrems and ergovaline for their insect deterrent properties. However, AgResearch Ltd. and PGG Wrightson Seeds Ltd. have developed a novel association between a tall-fescue-derived endophyte (designated strain AR 501) and a perennial ryegrass host. This brings {{a new set of}} secondary metabolites to the New Zealand agriculture scenario based on perennial ryegrass pastures, namely the loline alkaloids. An association formed between this fungus and perennial ryegrass would provide the grass sward excellent protection against ASW and grass grub, without creating any animal health problems. However, this process is far from perfect because of endophyte transmission failures. Possible reason for these failures include endophyte and host genotype incompatibility, environmental factors and crop management regimes. This study was an investigation of two of the factors that may affect the vertical transmission of AR 501 and the maintenance of endophyte viability in stored seeds. A controlled environment was used to determine the influence of temperature on endophyte transmission frequency, on fungal biomass and on concentrations of loline alkaloids, in tall fescue and perennial ryegrass. Seedlings of both associations were arranged in a controlled environment at four temperature regimes ranging from 6 - 25 °C. After three and six weeks, endophyte transmission frequencies and endophyte biomass were quantified. After three weeks plants from both associations were transferred from a 12 / 6 °C to a 25 / 16 °C environment and their endophyte biomass re-calculated. For perennial ryegrass, the endophyte transmission frequency was significantly higher in plants kept at a cold (day/night 12 / 6 °C) temperature regime compared to the warm (day/night 25 / 16 °C) regime. This was not observed in tall fescue. The endophyte biomass concentrations of both associations increased when after three weeks plants were transferred from the cold to warm temperature regime. To better understand how the endophyte and its host behaved under different temperature regimes, the cardinal temperature for AR 501 and the host was determined. The cardinal temperatures for AR 501 were higher in perennial ryegrass (Tb of - 1. 82 °C, Topt of 25. 26 °C and Tm of 54. 94 °C) than in tall fescue (Tb of - 0. 04 °C, Topt of 15. 90 °C and Tm of 29. 04 °C). Cardinal temperatures were also higher for perennial ryegrass than for tall fescue. However the induction of thermodormancy in tall fescue seeds interfered with the calculation of cardinal temperatures for the endophyte and tall fescue host, and it is probable that the optimal temperature for AR 501 in the tall fescue host may be higher than determined in this study. Storage factors such as temperature, seed moisture content and length of storage can affect the viability of both seed and endophyte. Seeds of both associations were stored for 12 months under four storage temperature regimes (5 °C, 10 °C, 20 °C and 30 °C) and at two seed moisture contents (10 % and 14 %) to investigate whether temperature and/or seed moisture content would affect endophyte viability in stored seeds. In both associations, endophyte in seeds stored at 30 °C and 14 % SMC had died after 12 months of storage, but in seeds stored in <b>moisture</b> <b>proof</b> packaging at lower temperature (5 or 10 °C), endophyte viability was maintained throughout the 12 months. In addition, the thermal time model was used to predict time for AR 501 viability in the stored seeds. The prediction was that AR 501 viability would remain above 70 % for 13 months longer in tall fescue seeds than in perennial ryegrass seeds if they were stored at low temperature (≤ 10 °C) and at 10 % SMC. The effect of seed crop management factors, such as nitrogen (N) fertiliser, fungicide and plant growth regulator application on AR 501 infection frequency in perennial ryegrass and Italian ryegrass was also investigated. None of the three seed production management factors affected the transmission of AR 501 from plant to seed in perennial ryegrass, but did so in Italian ryegrass. This requires further investigation...|$|E
