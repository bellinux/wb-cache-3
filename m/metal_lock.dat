50|$|Most of {{the plastic}} bottles used are {{recycled}} 1.5 liter bottles. After being filled with water and a little bleach, the bottle is pushed through a steel sheet {{that serves as a}} <b>metal</b> <b>lock</b> to prevent it from slipping. It is then embedded into a corrugated iron roof. A small part of the bottle is left outside while the rest of it protrudes into the house. Sealant is put around the hole made in the roof to keep it weather proof. The refractive properties of water ensures that the light from the sun that reaches the inside of the bottle becomes omni-directional mimicking an electric light bulb and emitting the same amount of light as a 40-60 W incandescent bulb depending on the amount of solar insolation available. Adding bleach to the water prevents it from turning green with algae and ensures a high quality light keeping the water clear for a longer time. In order to facilitate use of the invention through open source mechanisms, step-by-step guides on materials and installation are available online.|$|E

40|$|In December 2007, a male {{equipment}} operator was fatally {{injured by}} a <b>metal</b> <b>lock</b> ring propelled from a multi-piece wheel tire assembly he was inflating. The victim was employed by an excavating and snow removal company. At {{the time of}} the incident, he and a co-worker were getting their loaders ready to remove snow from a shopping mall parking lot. Soon after he started his loader, the victim noticed that his left front tire mounted on a multi-piece wheel was “soft”(under-inflated). The multi-piece rim wheel referring to the tire assembly consisted of six components: the rim base, valve assembly, tire, side ring, O-ring and lock ring. The function of the lock ring was to hold the tire in place by locking and securing the other wheel components when the tire was inflated. The victim asked the co-worker, whose loader had an air compressor, to put air in the tire. The initial tire pressure was not checked. The co-worker connected one end of an air hose to the quick-connect fitting on the air compressor and the clip-on chuck at the other end to the valve stem of the tire. The co-worker then went to his loader’s cab and used the throttle control to maintain the airflow. The air hose did not have an in-line pressure gauge. The victim checked the air pressure at the tire valve with a hand-held pressure gauge periodically as the tire was being inflated. The maximum cold tire inflation pressure specified by the tire manufacturer was 35 pounds per square inch (psi). After a few minutes, the victi...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} some {{recently}} developed applications, using {{all kinds of}} possibilities that are offered by shape memory effects, will be presented. The overview is meant to show {{the wide range of}} application fields, where a series of special properties of memory metals bring huge advantages and open new ways to develop products that normally could not be made with conventional, "non-living " materials. During the last years the main issue in memory metal industries was the production of superelastic devices for medical use. However, the use in connectors, actuators and combined sensor/actuator functions in safety or control devices is also getting more important. In martensitic state memory metals are used for their extreme deformability compared to conventional metals.

40|$|We combine stellar {{metallicity}} and stellar mass {{estimates for}} a large sample of galaxies drawn from the SDSS DR 2 spanning wide ranges in physical properties, in order to derive an inventory of the total mass of <b>metals</b> and baryons <b>locked</b> up in stars today. Physical parameter estimates are derived from galaxy spectra with high S/N (> 20). Coadded spectra of galaxies with similar velocity dispersions, absolute r-band magnitudes and 4000 Å-break values are used for those regions of parameter space where individual spectra have lower S/N. We estimate the total density of metals and of baryons in stars and, from these two quantities, we obtain a mass- and volume-averaged stellar metallicity of = 1. 04 +- 0. 14 Z_sun, i. e. consistent with solar. We also study how metals are distributed in galaxies according to their mass, morphology and age, and we then compare these distributions with the corresponding distributions of stellar mass. We find {{that the bulk of}} <b>metals</b> <b>locked</b> up in stars in the local Universe reside in massive, bulge-dominated galaxies, with red colours and high 4000 Å-break values corresponding to old stellar populations. Bulge-dominated and disc-dominated galaxies contribute similar amounts to the total stellar mass density, but have different fractional contributions to the mass density of metals in stars, in agreement with the mass-metallicity relation.

Like the German Jäger rifles, it had a scrolled brass trigger guard to help ensure a firm grip and a raised cheek-piece on the left-hand side of the butt. The stocks were made of walnut and held the barrel with three flat captive wedges. The rifle also had a <b>metal</b> <b>locking</b> bar to accommodate a 24-inch sword bayonet, {{similar to that of}} the Jäger rifle. The Baker was 45 inches from muzzle to butt, 12 inches shorter than the Infantry Musket, and weighed almost nine pounds. Although Infantry Muskets were not issued with cleaning kits, the Baker rifle had a cleaning kit, greased linen patches and tools, stored in the 'butt-trap' or patchbox; the lid of this was brass, and hinged at the rear so it could be flipped up. It was needed because, without regular cleaning, gunpowder fouling built up in the rifling grooves, and the weapon became much slower to load and less accurate.|$|R

40|$|The near {{infrared}} (IR) absorption spectra of starburst galaxies show several atomic and molecular lines from red supergiants {{which can be}} used to infer reliable stellar abundances. The <b>metals</b> <b>locked</b> in stars give a picture of the galaxy metallicity prior to the last burst of star formation. The enrichment of the new generation of stars born in the last burst can be traced by measuring the hot gas in the X-rays. For the first time detailed stellar abundances in the nuclear region of the starburst galaxy M 82 have been obtained. They are compared with those of the hot gas as derived from an accurate re-analysis of the XMM and Chandra nuclear X-ray spectra. The cool stars and the hot gas suggest [Fe/H]=- 0. 35 +/- 0. 2 dex, and an overall [Si,Mg/Fe] enhancement by 0. 4 and 0. 5 dex, respectively. This is consistent with a major chemical enrichment by SNe II explosions in recursive bursts on short timescales. Oxygen is more puzzling to interpret since it is enhanced by 0. 3 dex in stars and depleted by 0. 2 dex in the hot gas. None of the standard enrichment scenarios can fully explain such a behavior when compared with the other alpha-elements. Comment: APJ, in pres...|$|R

These conclusions depend very weakly on the mass of the PISN stellar progenitor, which instead affects considerably the composition and size distribution. For the assumed temperature evolution, grain condensation starts 150 - 200 days after the explosion; the dominant compounds for all progenitor masses are SiO 2 and Mg 2 SiO 4 while the contribution of amorphous carbon and magnetite grains grows with progenitor mass; typical grain sizes range between 0. 001 and a few 0. 1 micron and are always smaller than 1 micron.

The selection of dry screw compressors is dependent upon proper evaluation of the thermodynamic and mechanical characteristics inherent {{with this type of}} compressor. To be discussed are the selection parameters, capabilities, and limitations that must be considered for any process gas compressor application. The selection parameters include, but are not limited to, the following: ? Application range: Flows, pressures and temperatures suited for screw compressors as compared to other types of compressors. ? Gas handled: Molecular weight variations, corrosive elements, erosive components, entrained liquids, polymer formation, and other gas characteristics that can best be handled by dry screw compressors. ? Process control of flows, pressures and temperatures. ? Compliance with recognized design standards, i. e., API, PNEUROP. ?
