50|$|Paper {{drilling}} is {{a method}} to drill round holes into paper and other materials. For this purpose hollow paper drill bits are clamped into a driven <b>spindle</b> which <b>drills</b> into the pile of paper. Paper drill bits are available for different hole sizes and in different coating qualities. Unlike hole punching, where only {{one or a few}} sheets may be processed, a large number of sheets can be processed with a paper <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> Depending on the type of paper drill either the paper drill bits are lowered into the pile or the table is lifted. Paper <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> can be equipped with a different number of spindles which are each built into one paper drill head. The range starts with one- and two-spindle paper drills for small volumes and office purposes and reaches up to paper drilling platforms with more than 20 <b>spindles</b> / paper <b>drill</b> heads.|$|R

40|$|<b>Drilling</b> <b>machine</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} machine tools in industry except lathe and frais <b>machine.</b> <b>Drilling</b> <b>machine</b> has an important role on production proceses. But, vibration while drilling operation that caused by chatter or machine faults made the product output failure. One of the machine faults types is mass unbalance that can reduce the quality of product geometry. Therefore, dynamic behaviour analyze is necessary to prevent this mass unbalance will not happen. So, we did the dynamic behaviour analyze of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> used ANSYS 11. 0 Workbench. The aim of this research is to find out the natural frequency and the mode shape of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine,</b> could to display their mode shape deformation with damping caused by excitation forces 100 N, and could to display FRF and FFT graphics caused by mass unbalance. In order to achieve the aims, modal analysis method has been adopted.

The <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> were modeled in three configuration of head body position. Software ANSYS 11. 0 Workbench used to determine FRF. As the results, the different configuration of head body position has been influence the dynamic behaviour structure that can be signed with the different of natural frequency. More higher the natural frequency, more higher the stiffness and it’s allow the structure difficult to vibrate. From the FRF, we know that the increase operation rotation of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> allow higher vibration velocity that caused by mass unbalance. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{generally}} {{about how the}} mechanical system reacts when a load is given or friction is happen to touch the mechanical system. Every mechanical system will always be affected {{when there is a}} disturbance. Drilling operation is one of the common operations in the industry. When the drilling operation works, there must be a friction occurs when the work is done. Thus, there will be lack of performance for the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> The lack of the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> will lead to the speed of the machine that will decrease slightly. That is the main part of this project. To make the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> maintain, the speed must be increase as soon the friction is given to the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> To solve the problem, the Fuzzy Logic Method is use in this project. Using Fuzzy Logic Method, new equation will be finding and use it for this project. From the method, the speed of the motor will increase when the drilling operation is given a friction. There will be feedback for the error that the sensors detect from the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> The feedback will calculate the error and from the calculation the new increasing voltage will be determined. For the conclusion, the method is trying to find the new voltage for the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> to maintain the speed of the machine. From the fact, we know that when the voltage in increase, the speed will also increase. Thus, the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> will become more efficient...|$|R
