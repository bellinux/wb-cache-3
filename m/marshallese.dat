25|$|Named after British captain John Marshall, {{who first}} {{documented}} {{the existence of}} the islands in 1788. The family name is rendered ̧ in <b>Marshallese.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1914, the Empire of Japan {{occupied}} the Marshall Islands, and transferred German government properties to their own, including Bokak. Like the Germans before them, the Japanese colonial {{administration did not}} attempt to exploit the atoll, and the Northern Radak <b>Marshallese</b> continued to hunt and fish unmolested.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Marshallese</b> {{society is}} matrilineal and land is {{passed down from}} {{generation}} to generation through the mother. Land ownership ties families together into clans. Grandparents, parents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, and cousins form extended, close-knit family groups. Gatherings tend to become big events. One of the most significant family events is the first birthday of a child (kemem), which relatives and friends celebrate with feasts and song.|$|E
25|$|The Marshall Islands {{were added}} to the {{protectorate}} of German New Guinea in 1906. Using the justification that uninhabited atolls were unclaimed, the Germans seized Bokak as government property, despite the protests of the Iroji. As Japan's economic vigor expanded under the Meiji Emperor, the German administration noted <b>Marshallese</b> complaints of Japanese bird poaching, more from the view of protecting German sovereignty, rather than the interests of the islanders.|$|E
25|$|Facing {{the lagoon}} shore, {{about a quarter}} of Toke islet is planted in {{coconuts}} with a thick ground cover of Microsorum scolopendria. There is a small grove of Pisonia grandis, {{while the rest of the}} islet is covered with brushy woods of Heliotropium foertherianum, Portulaca oleracea, and Pandanus tectorius, fringed by Lepturus repens grasses, Laportea ruderalis shrubs, Boerhavia diffusa, B. tetrandra and other typical <b>Marshallese</b> species. There is also a tiny grove of Pisonia on Lojiron.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the present-day}} Pacific Island {{nations in the}} Oceania region were {{originally}} populated by Polynesian, Melanesian and Micronesian peoples {{over the course of}} thousands of years. European colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these under non-indigenous administration. During the 20th century several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states were formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for Indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the Chamorros of Guam and the Northern Marianas, and the <b>Marshallese</b> of the Marshall Islands.|$|E
25|$|Although humans {{migrated}} to the Marshall Islands about 2000 years ago, {{there appear to be}} no traditional <b>Marshallese</b> artifacts present that would indicate any long-term settlement. The lack of potable water and tiny lot of arable land compared to nearby Utirik has discouraged settlement. The atoll is traditionally occupied for brief periods for seasonal harvesting of copra, fish, turtles, coconut crabs, and other resources. Along with the other uninhabited northern Ratak atolls of Bikar and Bokak, Toke was traditionally the hereditary property of the Ratak atoll chain Iroji Lablab. The exploitation of resources was regulated by custom, and overseen by the Iroji.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, the Empire of Japan {{occupied}} the Marshall Islands, and transferred German government properties to their own, including Bikar. Like the Germans before them, the Japanese colonial administration (the South Pacific Mandate) {{did not attempt}} to exploit the atoll, and the Northern Radak <b>Marshallese</b> continued to hunt and fish unmolested. Following the end of World War II, the island came {{under the control of the}} United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. In 1951, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Army Corps of Engineers sponsored an expedition to Bikar and Taongi Atolls, to characterize their primeval environment.|$|E
25|$|Although humans {{migrated}} to the Marshall Islands about 2000 years ago, {{there appear to be}} no traditional <b>Marshallese</b> artifacts present that would indicate any long term settlement. The harsh, desiccated climate, lack of potable water, and poverty of the soils indicate that the atoll will probably remain uninhabited. The atoll has traditionally been used for hunting and gathering, particularly seabirds, by inhabitants of other atolls in the northern Ratak chain. Along with the other uninhabited northern Ratak atolls of Bikar and Toke, Bokak was traditionally the hereditary property of the Ratak atoll chain Iroji Lablab. The exploitation of abundant sea turtles, birds, and eggs was regulated by custom, and overseen by the Iroji.|$|E
25|$|Although humans {{migrated}} to the Marshall Islands about 2000 years ago, and Bikar was occasionally visited by the <b>Marshallese,</b> {{there is no evidence}} that there has ever been a resident human population. The lack of water and the susceptibility of the atoll to cyclone and storm disturbance indicate that it will probably remain uninhabited. The atoll has traditionally been used for hunting and gathering, particularly seabirds and turtles, by inhabitants of other atolls in the northern Ratak chain. Along with the other uninhabited northern Ratak atolls of Bokak (Taongi) and Toke, Bikar was traditionally the hereditary property of the Ratak atoll chain Iroji Lablab. The exploitation of abundant sea turtles, birds, and eggs was regulated by custom, and overseen by the Iroji.|$|E
25|$|To {{accommodate}} the dive program and anglers, the Bikini Council built new air-conditioned rooms with private bathrooms and showers. They included verandas overlooking the lagoon. There was a dining facility that served American-style meals. The head chef Mios Maddison also prepared <b>Marshallese</b> dishes featuring fresh seafood. Only 12 visitors were hosted at one time. Because of the lingering contamination, all {{fruits and vegetables}} used for the Bikini Atoll dive and sport fishing operation were imported. In September 2007, the last of Air Marshall Islands' commuter aircraft ceased operations when spare parts could not be located and the aircraft were no longer airworthy. A half dozen divers and a journalist were stranded for a week on Bikini Island. The Bikini islanders suspended land-based dive operations beginning in August 2008.|$|E
500|$|The Bahamian flag ranks sixth worldwide, {{behind the}} Hong Kong and Greek registries, but {{is similar in}} size to the <b>Marshallese</b> flag of convenience, with about 200 more ships but a {{carrying}} capacity about [...] lower. Malta, at the ninth position worldwide, had about 100 more ships than the Bahamas, with a capacity of , representing 4% of the world fleet with 12% growth that year.|$|E
500|$|The Marshall Islands were {{represented}} by one male athlete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in taekwondo, Anju Jason. This was Jason's first {{appearance at the}} Olympics. Jason {{was also the first}} <b>Marshallese</b> athlete to ever qualify for the Olympic Games, and was the only athlete from the Marshall Islands in the 2008 Summer Olympics that was not a wildcard entry. Jason defeated a competitor from Samoa at the qualification tournament in New Caledonia to qualify for the Olympics.|$|E
500|$|Transocean, {{through its}} Steinhausen, Switzerland {{subsidiary}} Triton Asset Leasing GmbH, operated the rig under the <b>Marshallese</b> flag of convenience. The rig was leased to BP on a 3-year contract for deployment in the Gulf of Mexico following construction. The lease was renewed in 2004 for a year, 2005 for 5 years, and 2009 for 3 years covering 2010 to 2013. [...] The last contract was worth $544million, or $496,800 a day, for a [...] "bare rig", with crew, gear and support vessels {{estimated to cost}} the same.|$|E
500|$|Athletes {{representing}} the Marshall Islands participated in four different events. [...] Anju Jason {{was the first}} <b>Marshallese</b> athlete ever {{to qualify for the}} Olympic Games. [...] Jason was the only athlete to meet the qualification standards, the other five athletes at the Games were all wildcard entries. He represented his country in taekwondo. Jared Heine is a swimmer and competed in the 100 meter backstroke. [...] In athletics, the nation was represented by Roman Cress who ran in the men's 100 meters. Haley Nemra also represented the Marshall Islands running in the women's 800 meters.|$|E
500|$|Vitarelli {{worked for}} two years in the late 1960s as the TTPI's {{district}} administrator representative on Ebeye Island. He organized development projects including school programs, a youth corps, and a community garden. He talked to reporters from Life Magazine who were banned from Ebeye, which angered the island's officials. [...] Vitarelli also warned the island's Commander about a future outbreak of gastroenteritis. When the outbreak occurred, he tried to assist in getting the islanders to hospital care. [...] In 1968, he spoke out against what he saw as the U.S. military's indifference to <b>Marshallese</b> workers.|$|E
500|$|While the two-piece {{swimsuit}} as {{a design}} existed in classical antiquity, the modern design first attracted public notice in Paris on July 5, 1946. French mechanical engineer Louis Réard introduced a design he named the [...] "bikini", taking the {{name from the}} Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, which was the colonial name the Germans gave to the atoll, transliterated from the <b>Marshallese</b> name for the island, [...] Four days earlier, the United States had initiated its first peace-time nuclear weapons test at Bikini Atoll as part of Operation Crossroads. Réard hoped his swimsuit's revealing style would create an [...] "explosive commercial and cultural reaction" [...] similar to the explosion at Bikini Atoll.|$|E
500|$|International law {{requires}} that every merchant ship be registered in a country, called its flag state. A ship's flag state exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship's equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents. As of 2007, the United States Central Intelligence Agency statistics count 4,295oil tankers of [...] or greater worldwide. Panama was the world's largest flag state for oil tankers, with 528 of the vessels in its registry. Six other flag states had more than 200 registered oil tankers: Liberia (464), Singapore (355), China (252), Russia (250), the Marshall Islands (234) and the Bahamas (209). The Panamanian, Liberian, <b>Marshallese</b> and Bahamian flags are open registries and considered by the International Transport Workers' Federation to be flags of convenience. By comparison, the United States and the United Kingdom only had 59 and 27 registered oil tankers, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Indigenous {{peoples in}} what is now the {{contiguous}} United States, including their descendants, were commonly called [...] "American Indians", or simply [...] "Indians" [...] domestically. Since the late 20th century, when some insisted on using [...] "Native American", as their preferred term, the United States Census Bureau and other parts of government have also adopted it. In Alaska, indigenous peoples belong to 11 cultures with 11 languages. These include the St. Lawrence Island Yupik, Iñupiat, Athabaskan, Yup'ik, Cup'ik, Unangax, Alutiiq, Eyak, Haida, Tsimshian, and Tlingit, and are collectively called Alaska Natives. They include Native American peoples as well as Inuit, who are distinct but occupy areas of the region. The United States has authority with Indigenous Polynesian peoples, which include <b>Marshallese,</b> Samoan, Tahitian, and Tongan; politically they are classified as Pacific Islands American. They are geographically, genetically, and culturally distinct from indigenous peoples of the mainland continents of the Americas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marshallese</b> Americans are Americans of <b>Marshallese</b> descent or a <b>Marshallese</b> {{naturalized}} in U.S. According to the 2010 census, 22,434 {{people of}} <b>Marshallese</b> origin {{live in the}} United States. This country has the largest population of <b>Marshallese</b> outside the Marshall Islands. Most of <b>Marshallese</b> live in Hawaii and Arkansas (mainly in Springdale, AR).|$|E

50|$|As {{compared}} to other Micronesian islands, most <b>Marshallese</b> adopted Japanese customs within {{the first few years}} of the Japanese administration. An Australian journalist travelling on a Burns Philp steamer noted that the most <b>Marshallese</b> women wore the kimono instead of the traditional loincloth (lavalava in <b>Marshallese)</b> in October 1918. Interethnic relations between the Japanese settlers and civil servants with the <b>Marshallese</b> were friendly, but racial segregation was enforced between Japanese and Micronesians in the workforce and educational sectors. As {{compared to}} Micronesians from other islands, <b>Marshallese</b> generally retained more aspects of their traditional lifestyles, relative to the small Japanese populace in the islands. Contrary to Japanese settlements in the other mandated islands, settlers consisted mainly of single men, and intermarriages with <b>Marshallese</b> women were much more frequent. Japanese songs such as Masaharu Gunto were written in the 1930s and reflected of romantic associations between Japanese men and <b>Marshallese</b> women. Ethnic suspicion and hatred by the <b>Marshallese</b> against the Japanese settlers developed during the Second World War, as the Japanese civilian government placed increased emphasis on militarism and forcibly conscripted many <b>Marshallese</b> to menial labour during the Second World War. Shortly before the end of the war, a few <b>Marshallese</b> led independent and isolated attacks against Japanese military personnel wherever possible.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marshallese,</b> a Micronesian language, is {{a member}} of the Eastern Oceanic {{subgroup}} of the Austronesian languages. The closest linguistic relatives of <b>Marshallese</b> are the other Micronesian languages, including Chuukese, Gilbertese, Kosraean, Nauruan and Pohnpeian. <b>Marshallese</b> shows 33% lexical similarity with Pohnpeian.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>Marshallese</b> are Baptist. The <b>Marshallese</b> Bible {{study group}} at Cross Church, a Baptist {{congregation}} localized in Springdale, has grown quickly in recent years, although {{the service is}} imparted in English, since the church does not have ministers who speak fluent <b>Marshallese.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because of the Marshall Islands {{entering}} the Compact of Free Association in 1986, <b>Marshallese</b> {{have been allowed}} to migrate and work in the United States. There are many reasons why <b>Marshallese</b> came to the United States. Some <b>Marshallese</b> came for educational opportunities, particularly for their children. Others sought work or better health care than what’s available in the islands. Massive layoffs by the <b>Marshallese</b> government in 2000 led to a second big wave of immigration.|$|E
5000|$|Kwajalein (...) Atoll was an {{important}} cultural site to the <b>Marshallese</b> people of the Ralik chain. In <b>Marshallese</b> cosmology, Kwajalein island {{was the site of}} an abundant flowering zebra wood tree. This was thought to have spiritual powers. <b>Marshallese</b> from other islands came to gather the [...] "fruits" [...] of this tree.|$|E
50|$|Japanese was {{extensively}} {{used for}} day-to-day communication {{during the colonial}} era by both Japanese and <b>Marshallese,</b> but was replaced by <b>Marshallese</b> after the Japanese surrender. Japanese is still preferred {{as a second language}} over English among those of mixed Japanese-Marshallese heritage, and islanders occasionally adopt Japanese loanwords for certain terms in the <b>Marshallese</b> language.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Marshallese</b> is the {{official}} language of the Marshall Islands and enjoys vigorous use. As of 1979, the language was spoken by 43,900 people in the Marshall Islands. Additional groups of speakers in other countries including Nauru and the United States bring {{the total number of}} <b>Marshallese</b> speakers to 49,550 Along with Pohnpeian and Chuukese, <b>Marshallese</b> stands out among Micronesian languages in having tens of thousands of speakers; most Micronesian languages have far fewer. [...] A dictionary and a Bible translation have been published in <b>Marshallese.</b>|$|E
