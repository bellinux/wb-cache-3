500|$|Berry {{received}} $12.5million for {{the title}} role in the film Catwoman, a $100million movie; it grossed $17million on its first weekend. She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E

[...] She believes that when {{she looks up at}} the moon, she can often spot her grandmother there, still living in her childhood home.|$|E

Between 1886 and 1893 he published nearly fifty songs, including [...] "The Letter That Never Came" [...] (1886), [...] "I Believe It for <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> So" [...] (1887), and [...] "The Pardon that Came Too Late" [...] (1891). These early successes may have encouraged Dresser to pursue songwriting rather than performing. In addition, he may have realized that publishing music would provide even more financial success than composing or performing.|$|E
