40|$|Tasmania is {{important}} for understanding Quaternary climatic change because {{it is one of}} only three areas that experienced extensive mid-latitude Southern Hemisphere glaciation and it lies in a dominantly oceanic environment at a great distance from Northern Hemisphere ice sheet feedbacks. We applied exposure dating using ³⁶Cl to an extensive sequence of moraines from the last glacial at Mt. Field, Tasmania. Glaciers advanced at 41 - 44 ka during Marine oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 and at 18 ka during MIS 2. Both advances occurred in response to an ELA lowering greater than 1100 m below the present-day <b>mean</b> <b>summer</b> freezing <b>level,</b> and a possible temperature reduction of 7 - 8 °C.

40|$|We {{report the}} first direct ages for late Quaternary {{glaciation}} on the North Island of New Zealand. Mt Ruapehu, the volcanic massif in the North Island 2 ̆ 7 s centre, is currently glaciated and probably sustained glaciers throughout the late Quaternary, yet no numeric ages {{have been reported}} for glacial advances anywhere on the North Island. Here, we describe cosmogenic 10 Be ages of the surface layers of a glacially transported boulder and glacially polished bedrock from the Tararua Range, part of the axial ranges of the North Island. Results indicate that a limited valley glaciation occurred, culminating in recession {{at the end of}} the last glacial coldest period (LGCP, ca. 18 ka). This provides an initial age for deglaciation on the North Island during the last glacial-interglacial transition (LGIT). It appears that glaciation occurred in response to an equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) lowering of 1400 m below the present-day <b>mean</b> <b>summer</b> freezing <b>level.</b> Ages for glaciation in the Tararua Range correspond closely to exposure ages for the last glacial maximum (LGM) from the lateral moraines of Cascade Valley in the South Island, and in Cobb Valley, in northern South Island. The corollary is that glaciation in the Tararua Range coincided with the phase of maximum cooling during MIS 2, prior to the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR), during the LGCP.

The spatial pattern of the seasonal fluctuations and inter-yearly variability here is much simpler than the heterogeneous distribution of groundwater depth classes.

40|$|Summary A {{seasonal}} {{variation in the}} month of initial detection of breast cancer has been previously observed in pre-menopausal women, and it has been proposed that {{this may be due to}} cyclic changes in tumour growth mediated by the effects of melatonin on ovarian function. To investigate this possibility serum melatonin concentrations have been measured every 2 h for 24 h at the summer and winter solstice in 20 pre-menopausal women with previous breast cancer and nine controls. Twelve women had detected their tumour in winter and eight in summer. Overall melatonin secretion assessed by either amplitude of the noctural melatonin pulse or the area under the 24 h melatonin curve (AUC) was not different between breast cancer women or controls. However, the amplitude and AUC fell in winter in breast cancer patients (summer to winter 93. 6 to 77. 5 pg ml 1, P< 0. 002 and 743 to 634 AUC units, P< 0. 005 for amplitude and AUC respectively), whereas the winter minus summer values were significantly positive in controls compared with cancer patients. The abnormal fall in winter values in the women with previous breast cancer was confined to the group of women who had been winter detectors (<b>mean</b> <b>summer</b> to winter <b>levels</b> 94. 9 to 72. 6 pg ml-, P< 0. 01 and 775 to 637 AUC units, P< 0. 05 for amplitude and AUC respectively) whereas there was no significant seasonal alteration in these measurements in summer detectors.

40|$|As pointed by the IPCC, {{climate change}} and {{evolution}} of green house gases emissions {{in the coming decades}} are likely to affect regional pollution levels as well as the background ozone levels (Jacob et al., 1999) : first, the evolution of climate due to the increase of green house gas emissions is liable to induce modifications of the meteorological parameters of crucial interest for air quality. Secondly, the emissions of air pollutants will be affected by changes in population and energy demands as well as policy aiming to reduce global warming or pollution impacts. In order to assess the relative impact of {{climate change and}} change in green house gas emissions, a set of regional simulations is conducted using CHIMERE model (Bessagnet et al., 2009). These simulations account for change in anthropogenic emissions of precursors from future scenarii, global background pollutant levels through appropriate boundary conditions from LMDz-INCA model, and future meteorological conditions reflecting AR 5 scenario. For consistency, all these forcings are built on the same scenario: the RCP 8. 5 (Representative Concentration Pathways, Riahi et al., 2007) developed in IPCC-AR 5 framework for climate projections. The RCP 8. 5 scenario used in this study is defined by a rising radiative forcing pathway leading to 8. 5 W. m- 2 in 2100.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the beetle Paropsisterna bimaculata was related to 33 environmental covariates distributed across in Tasmania. This beetle is an economic pest in Eucalyptus plantations, episodically occurring in large aggregations that damage tree canopies through overgrazing. A number of hypotheses relating to beetle outbreaks have been proposed by various researchers. Random forest modelling, a powerful non-parametric statistical approach {{that has not been}} frequently applied before in ecology, was used to assess specific predictions of these hypotheses. The models were developed using landscape layers and proximity to vegetation layers that were created using GIS for multiple combinations of climate variables and districts. The climate combinations assessed included: (1) <b>mean</b> <b>summer</b> maximum temperature and summer rainfall for survey years, (2) 30 year average for <b>mean</b> <b>summer</b> maximum and summer rainfall, (3) 30 year average for climate variables, (4) 30 year average for climate variables and <b>mean</b> <b>summer</b> maximum temperature and summer rainfall for survey years. The district combinations included all districts, Bass only, and all districts excluding Bass. Locations less than 10 kilometres from Poa grasslands showed highest beetle numbers, while increasing elevation also showed a strong positive relationship with P. bimaculata populations, and <b>mean</b> annual <b>summer</b> rainfall and survey year were important in the district of Bass. Thus, in terms of prior hypotheses, Poa appears to be an important overwintering site for P. bimaculata; beetle populations increase with elevation; beetle populations increase with age of plantation between 2 and 8 years; and Bass has greater variability than other districts in beetle density. Model outputs did not support, or only weakly supported, hypotheses that suggest beetle numbers are highest at highly productive sites, and are affected by the shape and size of forestry coupes and by plantation species. The random forests model with least error was based on all districts except Bass for thirty-year climate average data plus <b>summer</b> <b>mean</b> rainfall and <b>summer</b> <b>mean</b> maximum temperature data. A cost-benefit analysis nevertheless indicated that directing the ongoing beetle survey effort on the basis of model outputs would not reduce costs compared to the current broad-scale monitoring program.

40|$|There {{is growing}} concern for {{increased}} frequency of extreme events due to several severe floods and droughts occurring globally in recent years. Improving knowledge on {{the complexity of}} hydrological systems and interactions with climate is essential {{to be able to}} determine drivers and predict changes in the future. This is especially true in cold regions such as the Swedish Subarctic. This thesis explored changes in high peak flows and linked trends to climate. Trend analyses were applied on 18 catchments in the Swedish Subarctic over their entire periods of record and a common period (1990 - 2013) among the data to explore changes in flood magnitude, flood occurrence, <b>mean</b> <b>summer</b> flow, snowmelt onset and center of mass. Further, a flood frequency analysis was applied using the extreme value type I (Gumbel) distribution and selected flood percentiles were tested for stationarity. The results show the complexity of the hydrological system and interactions with climate. No clear overall pattern could be determined suggesting that changes are happening at catchment scale. Indications for a shift in flow regime from snowmelt-dominated to rainfall-dominated are evident with all significant trends pointing towards lower flood magnitudes in the spring flood, earlier flood occurrence and snowmelt onset, and decreasing <b>mean</b> <b>summer</b> flows. The shift in flow regime suggests that air temperature is more clearly reflected in streamflow than precipitation in the Swedish Subarctic. Decreasing trends in flood magnitude and <b>mean</b> <b>summer</b> flows are suggestive of permafrost thawing, which agrees with the increasing trends in the annual minimum flow. Long streamflow records can further link variability in streamflow to multidecadal atmospheric circulations over the North Atlantic. Most evident are changes towards lower <b>mean</b> <b>summer</b> flows (ten catchments significant at a 95 % confidence interval) and earlier snowmelt onset (eight catchments significant). Trends in the selected flood percentiles show indications towards an increase in extreme events over the entire period (significant for four catchments), with all significant trends being positive. Over the common period, no pattern is notable and the sensitivity of trend analyses is evident...|$|R
