500|$|The New York Times quoted Wheeler Parker, {{a cousin}} of Till's, who said, [...] "I was hoping that one day she [...] would admit it, so it <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that she did, and it gives me some satisfaction. It's {{important}} to people understanding how the word of a white person against a black person was law, {{and a lot of}} black people lost their lives because of it. It really speaks to history, it shows what black people went through in those days." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1997, Wallace {{was ordered}} to pay US$41,000 in damages {{following}} an incident involving {{a friend of a}} concert promoter who claimed Wallace and his entourage beat him up following a dispute in May 1995. He faced criminal assault charges for the incident which remains unresolved, but all robbery charges were dropped. Following the events of the previous year, Wallace spoke of a desire to focus on his [...] "peace of mind". [...] "My mom... my son... my daughter... my family... my friends are what <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now".|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{question}} is easily answered. Were you your own dear self it would <b>matter</b> nought <b>to</b> <b>me</b> were your name Kerr, or MacDougall, or Comyn, or aught else. It is you I love, and your ancestors or your relations <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{not one single}} jot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wally, you wouldn't want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{marry you}} if you knew you weren't {{the only man in}} the world that <b>mattered</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> would you?" ...|$|R

2500|$|After {{the release}} of It <b>Matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me,</b> Hill took a three-year break from {{recording}} to give herself a rest from four years of touring and to begin a family with McGraw. During her break, she joined forces with her husband for their first duet, [...] "It's Your Love". The song stayed at number one for six weeks, and won awards from both the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association. Hill has remarked that sometimes when they perform the song together, [...] "it [...] feel like anybody else was really watching." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{recording}} of Faith's second album was delayed by {{surgery to repair}} a ruptured blood vessel on her vocal cords. It <b>Matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> finally appeared in 1995 and was another success, with the title track becoming her third number-one country single. Several other top 10 singles followed, and more than 3 million copies of the album were sold. The fifth single from the album, [...] "I Can't Do That Anymore", was written by country music artist Alan Jackson. Other singles from the album include [...] "You Can't Lose Me", [...] "Someone Else's Dream", and [...] "Let's Go to Vegas".|$|E
2500|$|The song's initial {{concept was}} based on a lyric draft Jackson had written and discovered, which she thought would be {{suitable}} for the film's theme. Jackson stated [...] "it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> That's what I'm in love with, that's what <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the most, and it doesn't matter what other people say." [...] Following its release, Jackson stated [...] "I really liked that song a lot," [...] adding it was [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "a good summer song." [...] Jackson felt unsure of how the song would fare, but was pleased with its success. An unmastered version leaked and received airplay ahead of its scheduled release, followed by a positive response from critics and fans. Several radio stations created their own edits until the official version was released, prompting producer Jimmy Jam to exclaim [...] "That's wonderful, because it means radio is excited about it." [...] The song's success was likened to Jackson's return to a more positive and upbeat style in comparison to the bleak aura of The Velvet Rope, saying [...] "In the history of Janet, the records that are the happy records, that make people smile, have always traditionally been the more successful records, going back as far to songs like 'When I Think of You' to 'Doesn't Really Matter.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So they would--for a time. What {{does that}} <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> Isn't a fellow {{to protect himself}} when a fellow like you comes to him armed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not," [...] said Bilbil. [...] "I'm never contented; so it doesn't <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> whether I'm in your kingdom or in {{some other}} kingdom. Go away--will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{what they}} are, Mr. Ishmael. I have {{no wish to}} know your private affairs. Shall we stop this talk, which is not pleasant?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Hill's {{first two}} albums, Take Me as I Am (1993) and It <b>Matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> (1995), were major successes {{and placed a}} {{combined}} three number ones on Billboard's country charts. She then achieved mainstream and crossover success with her next two albums, Faith (1998) and Breathe (1999). Faith spawned her first international hit in early 1998, [...] "This Kiss", while Breathe {{became one of the}} best-selling country albums of all time, led by the huge crossover success of the songs [...] "Breathe" [...] and [...] "The Way You Love Me". It had massive sales worldwide and earned Hill three Grammy Awards. In 1996, before her marriage to Tim McGraw, Faith Hill appeared on the PBS music program Austin City Limits (season 21).|$|E
2500|$|Randall Wallace, {{who wrote}} the screenplay, has {{acknowledged}} Blind Harry's 15th century epic poem The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie as a major inspiration for the film. In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, [...] "Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's what <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> that it spoke to my heart." [...] Blind Harry's poem is now not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film that are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the hanging of Scottish nobles at the start), there are large parts that are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabella).|$|E
2500|$|During {{a hunting}} expedition, Osburgo and Valdeburgo {{encounter}} Arturo, but {{are aware that}} Alaide's cabin is close by. [...] Osburgo begs him to return for his wedding to Isoletta, but he refuses, declaring {{that he does not}} love her. He asks Valdeburgo to meet his true love, after which he promises that he will never see her again if Valdeburgo judges her unworthy. The pair approach the cabin, from which Alaide emerges. Upon seeing her, Valdeburgo hails her and almost calls out her real name, but Alaide stops him. Valdeburgo tells Arturo that —for reasons he cannot reveal— Arturo must renounce any intentions toward Alaide. She cannot ever marry Arturo. Thinking Valdeburgo is his rival for Alaide's affections, Arturo is about to attack him with his sword, but he declares that he is not a rival. (Trio: first Valdeburgo No: non ti son rivale; / non io ti tolgo a lei / [...] "No: I am not your rival; then Arturo [...] "Ah, if he is not my rival, / What does he wish of me"; then Alaide [...] "No, you have no rival".) Alaide begs Arturo to leave, promising that she will see him again: [...] "Your life, Arturo, <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as my own". Both Alaide and Valdeburgo urge Arturo to leave.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] he said, [...] "I {{ought to}} be glad of that. But now it doesn't seem <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> very much. We killed her.... What does that <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'll learn 'im!" [...] said Morel. [...] "It none <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> whose lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' {{about just}} as he's a mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You scoundrel!" [...] she cried. [...] "Do {{you think}} it <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> what your black-blooded countrymen and women think! Your Moorish customs may be {{necessary}} for them, but I am an American!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean it <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but {{it matters}} to no one else. Anyhow," [...] he continued, more amiably, [...] "I {{see no reason why}} you should be bothered with other people's nuisances." ...|$|E
60|$|HODSON. I'm sure you're very kind, sir; but it don't seem <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{whether they}} like me or not. I'm {{not going to}} stand for {{parliament}} here, sir.|$|R

6000|$|... "At Graham's," [...] said Carnally, sitting down. [...] "I've come instead. Mr. Allinson's {{got into}} a habit of leaving <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> There are things I do better than he can. I'm not so fastidious as he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{was talking}} about it," [...] {{corrected}} Mr. Wilks, in a hoarse voice. [...] "You brought up the subject and I agreed with you--not that it <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> 'ow people get married. That's their affair. Banns or license, it's all one to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not," [...] she agreed. [...] "You {{have had}} all the {{opportunities}} which any man should need, of explaining certain <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> My curiosity in them has ended; also my interest--in you.

6000|$|Eleanor {{decided to}} change the subject for a while, though she had not done with it yet. [...] "Well," [...] she said languidly, [...] "I really don't think it <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> whether she does or not.

6000|$|... "It doesn't matter!" [...] George exclaimed, {{and gasped}} with indignation. [...] "Anyhow, it <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I've been fuming and {{fretting}} since I saw your principal." [...] He {{turned to the}} others, as if for support.

6000|$|... "Well, friends," [...] {{said the}} Scarecrow, [...] "we mustn't stay {{here in the}} meadows all night, so let us find a {{pleasant}} place to sleep.
