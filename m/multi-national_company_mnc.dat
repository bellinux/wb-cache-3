Key themes were identified with the assistance of NVivo software. In this study, accounting, through formal performance evaluation, contributes to trust building between supervisors and their subordinates. Formal performance evaluation through transparent and objective evaluation increases trust in the supervisor. On the other hand, informal performance evaluation tends to decrease trustful behaviour due to secrecy in the evaluation process.   It appears that Indonesian national culture does influence organizational culture preference in the local staff.

These companies also improve the mechanisms of knowledge sharing with foreign markets and international operations.

40|$|Using ethnographic {{evidence}} from the former Soviet republics, this article examines a relatively new and mainly unobserved in the International Business (IB) literature phenomenon of communication disengagement that manifests itself in many emerging markets. We link it to the deficiencies of the local professional business discourse rooted in language limitations reflecting lack of experience with the market economy. This hampers cognitive coherence between foreign and local business entities, adding to the liability of foreignness as certain instances of professional experience fail to find adequate linguistic expression, and complicates cross-cultural adjustments causing <b>multi-national</b> <b>companies</b> (<b>MNCs)</b> financial losses. We contribute to the IB literature by examining cross-border semantic sensemaking through a retrospectively constructed observational study. We argue that a relative inadequacy of the national professional idiom {{is likely to remain}} a feature of business environment in post-communist economies for some time and therefore should be factored into business strategies of MNCs. Consequently, we recommend including discursive hazards in the risk evaluation of international projects...|$|R

Specifically, variables such as trade openness, infrastructure quality, market-size, human capital and natural resource are tested using the ADF and cointegration tests to ensure that the regression is not spurious. In line with several other empirical studies, result obtained comfirm that traditional factors such as market size are still dominant factors shaping the distribution of FDI in Malaysia, while the natural resource availability is the only insignificant variable. However, other non-traditional factors such as trade openness, agglomeration and human capital are also greatly increasing in importance, especially during this era of globalisation, Beside that, the complex global integration strategies adopted by <b>multi-national</b> <b>companies</b> (<b>MNCs)</b> which favour the presence of sophisticated and created assets in host countries over most other determinants also play an important role. Therefore, it is crucial that developing countries over most other determinants also play an important role.

Understanding the weight that MNCs gives to them can prompt to understand the reasons behind the success stories, the struggles - and even failures - that some companies had in the aforementioned region. The approach was via an initial analysis of the scholar bibliography in order to define three main dimensions in the models or frameworks that deal with the strategy used to land. After this, and through interviews, was found out how relevant are each of them for their companies, how they weight them and if there were other dimensions considered. The question that this thesis contributes to understand is if all new market strategic dimensions are equally relevant for a MNC when arriving to Latin America.

There currently exist numerous comparative studies analysing countries in a Western context which have similar or different scales of economies, but with relatively similar institutional theories. There have also been several comparative studies published comparing CSR between a developed Western and a developing non-Western context. However less attention has been given comparing developed economies between a Western and non-western context within the one study. For this study, Singapore was chosen as a developed Eastern country and compared with the UK, a Western developed country. Using data analysis from four <b>multi-national</b> <b>companies</b> (<b>MNCs)</b> in the financial sector operating in both UK and Singapore, this research looks at how the theoretical frameworks of the varieties of capitalism, national business system and the institutional theories of each country affect the drivers and motivations of CSR of the financial sector in each country.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the capacity}} of global networks of civil society actors to supplement effectively weak state regulation in reducing human rights abuse by <b>multi-national</b> <b>companies</b> (<b>MNCs).</b> The effectiveness of non-government organizations {{as part of a}} network of control finds support both in the radical criminological literature as well as those explicitly advocating for a networked regulatory approach. This case study of the Indonesian sport shoe industry demonstrates that networked regulation has had a positive short- to medium-term impact on respect for trade union rights among some manufacturers producing for western MNCs. However, inconsistent approaches by the MNCs and ongoing resistance by manufacturers has made this influence difficult to sustain. Critically, the Indonesian state apparatus emerges as a powerful and primarily—but far from completely—complicit set of actors: applying criminal sanctions for trade union rights violations but failing to enforce them, and influencing networked regulation in complex, contingent ways. This case study suggests both that advocates and practitioners of networked regulation need to find more effective ways to respond to the corporate drive to maximize profit and that networked regulation’s long-term usefulness will likely depend {{on the extent to which}} it draws from and operates to strengthen progressive regulatory elements within Asian states...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn India, {{the process}} of {{globalisation}} has experienced many phases of ups and downs i. e. from the initial period of exceptionally high to disappointingly declining GDP after 2007 - 08 global financial crisis. The Government of India has opened up many sectors and areas to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in a gradual manner. However, agriculture sector has been exposed to <b>Multi-national</b> <b>Companies</b> (<b>MNCs)</b> in a restricted manner considering the threat of land grabbing {{as well as other}} technical, social and economic issues.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the historical influences and chronological development of foreign investors on Malaysian Bumiputera (indigenous) new technology-based small firms (NTBSFs). Design/methodology/approach: Weick&# 039;s (1989) conceptual theory building approach is used to conduct a critical historical documentary analysis of the international, local, academic and government inward foreign investments literature from prior Malaysia&# 039;s independence (1957) through to 2016. Findings: Increased foreign investment between 1957 and 2016 proved to be effective for Malaysia to transform its economy from a reliance on primary production to a focus on innovation and value-added industries such as the biotechnology and the information and communication and technology sectors. Research limitations/implications: Local and international literature addressing inward foreign investments towards host countries yielded four key research implications: employment effects, strategic alliances, technology transfer and knowledge transfer. Creation of firm-specific resources in addition to government assistance, particularly through grants and advisory services, significantly contribute to the sustainability of Bumiputera NTBSFs. Practical implications: Inward foreign investment through subsidiary <b>multi-national</b> <b>companies</b> (<b>MNCs)</b> leads to the formation of strategic alliances between MNCs and Bumiputera NTBSFs, generating employment opportunities, contributing to Malaysia&# 039;s development aims. Social implications: Charting the chronological development and historical influence of foreign investment from a Malay-Bumiputera perspective provides an in-depth understanding of the evolution of what is now a multi-cultural Malaysian society.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between work-family conflict (WFC) and organisational commitment, and considered gender and number of dependents as moderators. Participants were self-defined full time working adults from various work forces in Malaysia and were recruited via email, telephone and social media. The questionnaire was available online (n= 93) and in printed forms (n= 109) with a final response rate of 72. 4 %. Two main sections in the questionnaire measured work-family conflict and organisational commitment. Work-family conflict consisted of four measures: strain-based work interfering with family (WIF), time-based work interfering with work, strain-based family interfering with work (FIW) and time-based family interfering with work. Affective commitment and continuance commitment were assessed. 	Exploratory factor analysis, correlations and hierarchical regressions were conducted on the variables in this study. Results revealed negative relationships for both strain-based and time-based WIF with affective commitment. In regards to continuance commitment, the relationship was positive for strain-based WIF but not significant for time-based WIF. No relationship was found between strain-based and time-based FIW with affective commitment. The relationships between strain-based and time-based FIW and continuance commitment were positive. Gender moderated the relationship between time-based WIF and affective commitment, whereby the relationship was negative for female employees only. Additionally, the relationship between time-based FIW and affective commitment was negative for male employees. The number of dependents employees had did not moderate any relationships in this study. Collectivism, the self-concept theory and paternalistic roles present in organisational superiors in Malaysia are among the possible reasons for the relationships found in this study. This study has contributed to gaps in the literatures on work-family conflict and organisational commitment in Malaysia. In terms of practical implications, the results may serve as guidelines in the development of family-friendly policies for Malaysian organisations or <b>multi-national</b> <b>companies</b> (<b>MNC)</b> operating in Eastern cultures...|$|R
40|$|Globalisation {{has made}} the world a very small place. <b>Multi-National</b> <b>Companies</b> (<b>MNCs)</b> seek to {{optimise}} their return on overseas investmentby applying stringent techniques for assessing the suitability of new markets. The growth {{over the last decade}} in global foreign direct investment (FDI), points to an increasing need by MNCs to find appropriate overseas locations to serve fragmented local markets and to be closer to key customers. There is a belief that MNC 2 ̆ 7 s provide quality jobs,superior skills and technology and opportunities for local linkages and exports (Dunning, 1993, Young et al., 1994 a; Dicken, 1998). In recent years, the Republic of Ireland has been haloed as a leading location for foreign direct investment. Neatly perched on the periphery of Europe, Ireland has in the last decade, outperformed many developed countries. More recent waves of investment are seen as being of higher quality in terms of affiliate autonomy and local sourcing (Amin et al., 1994) and as a result, the extent to which inward investors become embedded in host countries takes on even greater significance (Phelps, 2000). The scope of this research is to conduct an exploratory investigation into the factors that specifically influenced decisions by MNCs to invest in R & D facilities in Ireland. The investigative methodologies employed saw the application of both primary and secondary research. An initial review of the relevant literature focused on FDI in the global and Irish contexts. Primary research, in the form of depth-interviews, was undertaken with existing MNCs in Ireland. The results of the research indicate that whilst Ireland has been extremely successful in attracting manufacturing and service related activity, it has not done as well in securing large scale R&D investment. Equally, the factors that conspired to attract existing R&D investment in Ireland do not follow the more traditional and expected investment requirements matrix as applied by MNCs in seeking new investment locations...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} study evaluated {{the impact of}} competitive marketing {{on the performance of}} multinational and indigenous food and beverage manufacturing companies in Nigeria. The study investigated how these companies utilized marketing orientation and practices, organizational structure and strategy, marketing strategies on acquisition of market shares, usage of marketing mix elements on returns on capital employed, and how the competitive use of these variables influence the perception of consumers. The {{research study}} was developed around the theories of connectionist, personality, innovation diffusion, and cost structure and business performance. These variables were used to evolve a detailed analysis of issues relating to product quality, organizational structures and management theories. Theoretical models were reflected and used in developing five different hypotheses that were investigated through the survey of forty multinational and one-hundred and twenty indigenous foods and beverage manufacturing companies which were respectively randomly selected. Copies of well structured questionnaire were administered to companies sampled. The validity and reliability of the instrument were measured at Cronbach’s alpha of 0. 69 and alternative form validity of 0. 62. Five hypotheses were raised and tested at 0. 05 significant levels. The findings revealed that marketing orientation adopted by <b>multi-national</b> <b>companies</b> (<b>MNCs)</b> yielded better performance than those of indigenous companies (INCs), the structure/strategy adopted by MNCs yielded better performance than those of INCs, marketing strategies adopted by MNCs yielded more market shares than those of INCs, MNCs use of elements of marketing mix yielded higher rates of returns on capital employed than that of INCs, and competitive use of these 4 Ps for consumers’ perception by MNCs yielded better performance compared to that of indigenous counterparts. The conclusion from the research findings showed that indigenous companies were unable to compete favourably because of their limited financial resources. It was recommended that indigenous companies should adopt competitive marketing, functional structure and strategy, with five marketing divisions, competitive use of elements of marketing mix, and embark on the production of food and beverages for export...|$|R
