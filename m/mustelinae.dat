Mead, concluding that the mink was restricted to nearshore islands, suggested that the large size was due to insular gigantism. Since almost all members of the subfamily <b>Mustelinae</b> exhibit sexual dimorphism, male sea minks were probably larger than female sea minks. The sea mink's wider carnassial teeth and blunter carnassial blades suggest that they crushed hard shells more often than did the teeth of the American mink.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Mustelidae, as {{the largest}} and most-diverse family of order Carnivora, {{comprises}} eight subfamilies. Phylogenetic relationships among these Mustelidae subfamilies remain argumentative subjects in recent years. One {{of the main reasons}} is that the mustelids represent a typical example of rapid evolutionary radiation and recent speciation event. Prior investigation has been concentrated on the application of different mitochondrial (mt) sequence and nuclear protein-coding data, herein we employ 17 nuclear non-coding loci (> 15 kb), in conjunction with mt complete genome data (> 16 kb), to clarify these enigmatic problems. Results The combined nuclear intron and mt genome analyses both robustly support that Taxidiinae diverged first, followed by Melinae. Lutrinae and <b>Mustelinae</b> are grouped together in all analyses with strong supports. The position of Helictidinae, however, is enigmatic because the mt genome analysis places it to the clade uniting Lutrinae and <b>Mustelinae,</b> whereas the nuclear intron analysis favores a novel view supporting a closer relationship of Helictidinae to Martinae. This finding emphasizes a need to add more data and include more taxa to resolve this problem. In addition, the molecular dating provides insights into the time scale of the origin and diversification of the Mustelidae subfamilies. Finally, the phylogenetic performances and limits of nuclear introns and mt genes are discussed in the context of Mustelidae phylogeny. Conclusion Our study not only brings new perspectives on the previously obscured phylogenetic relationships among Mustelidae subfamilies, but also provides another example demonstrating the effectiveness of nuclear non-coding loci for reconstructing evolutionary histories in a group that has undergone rapid bursts of speciation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Mustelids (Mustelidae) {{exhibit a}} wide {{morphological}} and ecological diversity, ranging from aquatic to semi arboreal and fossorial forms. It {{is the most}} diversity family in Carnivora, and this has promoted {{a great number of}} taxonomic arrangements for subfamilies, which can range from two to 15 depending on the author. The relatively recent use of molecular data has helped to elucidate the classification of mustelids, and eight subfamilies are currently recognized: <b>Mustelinae,</b> Galictinae, Helictidinae, Martinae, Melinae, Mellivorinae, Taxidiinae and Lutrinae. However, some of these subfamilies have nomenclatural problems, not receiving the oldest available name. The subfamily that includes martens (Martes, Charronia and Pekania), tayra (Eira) and wolverine (Gulo) has received the name of Martinae Wagner, 1841, but the oldest available name is Guloninae Gray, 1825. This problem also occurs for the subfamily that includes the grisons (Galictis), Patagonian weasel (Lyncodon), marbled polecat (Vormela) and striped weasels (Ictonyx and Poecilogale), which are known as Grisoninae Pocock, 1921, but the correct name for this group is Ictonychinae, Pocock, 1921. The subfamily that includes ferret badgers (Melogale) retains the name Helictidinae Gray, 1865, because its validity is not affected when the type-genus of the subfamily becomes a junior synonym of another genus.

40|$|A {{population}} of Achatinella <b>mustelina</b> occupying four trees within a 5 x 5 -m quadrat {{on a ridge}} in the Waianae Mountains of Oahu, Hawaii, was studied by mark-recapture techniques. Between September 1974 and December 1975, 222 snails were individually marked and measured. Recapture analyses indicate that the standing population consisted of about 220 snails, of which an average of 40 percent were {{large enough to be}} sexually reproductive. Growth of A. <b>mustelina</b> was found to be slow, averaging about 2 mm increase in length per year from a birth size of 4. 50 mm to a size at terminal growth of 18. 44 mm. Maturity is estimated to occur at an age of 6. 9 yr. During the course of the study, snails belonging to the introduced predatory species Euglandina rosea were found progressively nearer the study site. In August 1979, shells of E. rosea were abundant in and about the study area and no living specimens of A. <b>mustelina</b> or any other arboreal snail species could be found. We conclude that E. rosea was responsible for the destruction of the population under study and that species with life histories similar to that of A. <b>mustelina</b> stand little chance of surviving the ravages of such introduced predators...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyzed}} a concatenated (8492 bp) nuclear-mitochondrial DNA {{data set}} from 44 musteloids (including the first genetic data for Lyncodon patagonicus) with parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods of phylogenetic and biogeographic inference and two Bayesian methods of chronological inference. Here {{we show that}} Musteloidea emerged approximately 32. 4 - 30. 9 million years ago (MYA) in Asia, shortly after the greenhouse-icehouse global climate shift at the Eocene-Oligocene transition. During their Oligocene radiation, which proceeded wholly or mostly in Asia, musteloids diversified into four primary divisions: the Mephitidae lineage separated first, succeeded by Ailuridae and the divergence of the Procyonidae and Mustelidae lineages. Mustelidae arose approximately 16. 1 MYA within the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, and extensively diversified in the Miocene, mostly in Asia. The early offshoots of this radiation largely evolved into badger and marten ecological niches (Taxidiinae, Melinae, Mellivorinae, Guloninae, and Helictidinae), whereas the later divergences have adapted to other niches including those of weasels, polecats, minks, and otters (<b>Mustelinae,</b> Ictonychinae, and Lutrinae). Notably, and contrary to traditional beliefs, the morphological adaptations of badgers, martens, weasels, polecats, and minks each evolved independently more than once within Mustelidae. Ictonychinae (which is most closely related to Lutrinae) arose approximately 9. 5 - 8. 9 MYA, most likely in Asia, where it diverged into the Old World Ictonychini (Vormela, Poecilictis, Ictonyx, and Poecilogale) and New World Lyncodontini (Lyncodon and Galictis) lineages. Ictonychini presumably entered Africa during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (at the Miocene-Pliocene transition), which interposed the origins of this clade (approximately 6. 5 - 6. 0 MYA) and its African Poecilictis-Ictonyx-Poecilogale subclade (approximately 4. 8 - 4. 5 MYA). Lyncodontini originated approximately 2. 9 - 2. 6 MYA at the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition in South America, slightly after {{the emergence of the}} Panamanian land bridge that provided for the Great American Biotic Interchange. As the genera Martes and Ictonyx (as currently circumscribed) are paraphyletic with respect to the genera Gulo and Poecilogale, respectively, we propose that Pekania and Poecilictis be treated as valid genera and that "Martes" pennanti and "Ictonyx" libyca, respectively, be assigned to these genera...|$|E
40|$|Retroviruses infect a {{wide range}} of vertebrates. The {{understanding}} of the deep history and host distribution of retroviruses remains far from complete. Retroviruses can be integrated into their host genomes and occasionally become vertically inherited genomic loci. These integrated retroviruses, known as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), provide "molecular fossils" for past retroviral infections and are useful for studying the deep history and ecology of retroviruses. ERVs are highly abundant in vertebrate genomes. However, endogenous foamy viruses and lentiviruses appear to be extremely rare. The primary focus of the research presented here is to discover and analyze novel endogenous foamy viruses and lentiviruses in animal genomes. Foamy virus has been thought to exclusively infect three placental mammal superorders (Laurasiatheria, Euarchontoglires, and Xenarthra). The discovery of endogenous foamy viral elements (CoeEFV) in the genome of the coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) extends the host range of foamy viruses to fish lineages (Appendix A). I demonstrate that foamy viruses have likely codiverged with their vertebrate hosts for more than 407 million years. The discovery of CoeEFV provides evidence for an ancient marine origin of retroviruses. Endogenous foamy virus-like elements (PSFVaye) were also identified within the genome of a Malagasy lemur, the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) (Appendix B). Phylogenetic analysis shows that PSFVaye is divergent from all currently known simian foamy viruses, suggesting a potentially ancient association between foamy viruses and primate species. Another novel endogenous foamy virus (CaEFV) was identified in the genome of the Cape golden mole (Chrysochloris asiatica). The discovery of CaEFV reveals foamy virus infection in the placental mammal superorder Afrotheria and the long-term cospeciation between foamy viruses and placental mammals (Appendix C). Lentivirus has been thought to have a relatively recent origin. Endogenous lentivirus insertions (MELV) were discovered within the genomes of some species of the Weasel family (Mustelidae) (Appendix D). I verified the presence of MELV insertions in the genomes of several species of the Lutrinae and <b>Mustelinae</b> subfamilies but not the Martinae subfamily, which suggests that the lentiviral invasion likely occurred between 8. 8 and 11. 8 million years ago. Phylogenetic analysis suggests MELV might represent a novel lentiviral group. The discovery of MELV extends the host range of lentiviruses to the Caniformia. Endogenous lentiviruses (GvaELV) were also identified in the genome of the Sunda flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) (Appendix E). Phylogenetic analysis shows that GvaELV is a sister group of all known lentiviruses. The discovery of GvaELV might give a clue to the early evolution of lentiviral genome architecture. In summary, the discoveries and analyses of these novel ERVs provide important insights into the deep history and ecology of foamy viruses and lentiviruses as well as the retroviruses as a whole...|$|E

Achatinellines are arboreal pulmonate gastropods characterized by slow growth and late age at first reproduction.

Juvenile Partulina redfieldii (Newcomb) and Achatinella <b>mustelina</b> Migheis were kept in laboratory environmental chambers with conditions set to emulate those in the native habitat of P. redfieldii. The snails were provided with fresh leaves and branches of Metrosideros polymorpha Gaud., a natural substratum for the snails. Laboratory comparisons of P. redfieldii and A. <b>mustelina</b> maintained with a natural diet augmented or not with cultures of native fungi grown on potato dextrose agar revealed that snails of both species grew significantly faster on the augmented diet and that P. redfieldii attained sexual maturity at an earlier age. Comparison of growth of P. redfieldii in the laboratory with similarly sized snails in the field revealed significantly faster growth in the laboratory animals. There {{was no significant difference between}} growth rates of A. <b>mustelina</b> provided with an augmented food supply in the laboratory and similarly sized animals in the field. It is likely that food availability limits growth rate in the field for P. redfieldii, but there is no evidence that growth in the field for A. <b>mustelina</b> is food-limited. However, the natural diet or temperature-humidity requirements of A. <b>mustelina</b> may not have been adequately met in the laboratory, obscuring laboratory-field comparisons. Partulina redfieldii, collected from the field as adults and maintained in isolation in the laboratory, produced offspring for at least 4 yr without the opportunity to outcross. Fecundity of isolated individuals was comparable with that reported for animals in the field, and there was no indication of fecundity decreasing over time in isolation. In addition, four of five P. redfieldii isolated as juveniles attained apparent sexual maturity at ages of 3. 2 to ca. 5 yr. A single offspring was produced by one of these snails, suggesting self-fertilization as one mechanism allowing the species to reproduce for prolonged periods of time in the absence of mates...|$|R
