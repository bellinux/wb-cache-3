2500|$|Reporter genes: Some vectors {{may contain}} a {{reporter}} gene {{that allow for}} identification of plasmid that contains inserted DNA sequence. [...] An example is lacZ-α which codes for the N-terminus fragment of β-galactosidase, an enzyme that digests galactose. [...] A <b>multiple</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>site</b> is located within lacZ-α, and an insert successfully ligated into the vector will disrupt the gene sequence, resulting in an inactive β-galactosidase. [...] Cells containing vector with an insert may be identified using blue/white selection by growing cells in media containing an analogue of galactose (X-gal). Cells expressing β-galactosidase (therefore doesn't contain an insert) appear as blue colonies. White colonies would be selected as those that may contain an insert. Other commonly used reporters include green fluorescent protein and luciferase.|$|E
2500|$|In a cloning experiment, a gene may be {{inserted}} into a plasmid used for transformation. [...] However, in such experiment, {{not all the}} plasmids may contain a successfully inserted gene. [...] Additional techniques may therefore be employed further to screen for transformed cells that contain plasmid with the insert. [...] Reporter genes {{can be used as}} markers, such as the lacZ gene which codes for β-galactosidase used in blue-white screening. [...] This method of screening relies on the principle of α-complementation, where a fragment of the lacZ gene (lacZα) in the plasmid can complement another mutant lacZ gene (lacZΔM15) in the cell. [...] Both genes by themselves produce non-functional peptides, however, when expressed together, as when a plasmid containing lacZ-α is transformed into a lacZΔM15 cells, they form a functional β-galactosidase. [...] The presence of an active β-galactosidase may be detected when cells are grown in plates containing X-gal, forming characteristic blue colonies. [...] However, the <b>multiple</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>site,</b> where a gene of interest may be ligated into the plasmid vector, is located within the lacZα gene. [...] Successful ligation therefore disrupts the lacZα gene, and no functional β-galactosidase can form, resulting in white colonies. [...] Cells containing successfully ligated insert can then be easily identified by its white coloration from the unsuccessful blue ones.|$|E

30|$|Detection of protein-protein {{interaction}} {{can provide}} valuable information for investigating the biological function of proteins. The current methods that applied in protein-protein interaction, such as co-immunoprecipitation and pull down etc., often cause plenty of working time {{due to the}} burdensome cloning and purification procedures. Here we established a system that characterization of protein-protein interaction was accomplished by co-expression and simply purification of target proteins from one expression cassette within E. coli system. We modified pET vector into co-expression vector pInvivo which encoded PPV NIa protease, two cleavage site F and two <b>multiple</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>sites</b> that flanking cleavage sites. The target proteins (for example: protein A and protein B) were inserted at <b>multiple</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>sites</b> and translated into polyprotein {{in the order of}} MBP tag-protein A-site F-PPV NIa protease-site F-protein B-His 6 tag. PPV NIa protease carried out intracellular cleavage along expression, then led to the separation of polyprotein components, therefore, the interaction between protein A-protein B can be detected through one-step purification and analysis. Negative control for protein B was brought into this system for monitoring interaction specificity. We successfully employed this system to prove two cases of reported protien-protein interaction: RHA 2 a/ANAC and FTA/FTB. In conclusion, a convenient and efficient system has been successfully developed for detecting protein-protein interaction.|$|R

These vectors have been used successfully for DNA sequencing with the dideoxy-method, and can be used for any other purpose for which M 13 derivatives are used. However, the pEMBL plasmids have the advantage of being smaller than M 13 vectors, and the purification of the DNA is simpler.

Current treatments are toxic and poorly effective due to the acquisition of resistance within Leishmania populations. Thus, the pursuit for new antileishmanial drugs is a priority. The available methods for drug screening based on colorimetric assays using vital dyes are time-consuming. Currently, the use of fluorescent reporter proteins is replacing the use of viability indicator dyes. We have constructed two plasmids expressing the red fluorescent protein mCherry with <b>multiple</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>sites</b> (MCS), adequate for N- and C-terminal fusion protein constructs.

The term “plasmid” was proposed for the first time in 1952, regarding to any heritable elements independent of chromosomal DNA (Lederberg 1952). Plasmids consist of several basic elements including origin of replication (ori), promoter, insertion gene, antibiotic resistance, <b>multiple</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>sites,</b> and some additional genes.

Promoter activity can be determined by inserting DNA fragments into the <b>multiple</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>sites</b> of the vectors forming transcriptional and/or translational fusions between the cat structural gene and an inserted promoter region. The activity of the nopaline synthase (nos) promoter was demonstrated with the vector. However, three animal promoters tested with this system showed no measurable activity in plant cells. Examination of 40 independently derived transformed tissues revealed a 200 -fold difference in the nos promoter activity. Furthermore, there is no apparent correlation between the neomycin phosphotransferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities, although both genes are closely linked and under control of identical nos promoters.
