40|$|A {{variable}} valve timing (VVT) can improve fuel efficiency, reduce CO 2 emission and increase torque output. To achieve VVT in internal combustion engine, new devices such as mechanical, hydraulic, <b>motor-driven</b> and electromagnetic <b>actuator</b> have been developed in past years to replace the conventional camshaft valve train system used currently. Among these, the electromagnetic actuator using solenoids is the most advance system to provide the most flexibility to valve timing, but it has critical drawback of high power consumption. This paper presents a novel design of Hybrid Magnet Engine Valve Actuator (HMEVA) using shorted turn. A shorted turn is placed into existing design {{in order to reduce}} the inductance of coil and improve the initial response.

5000|$|The new {{transmission}} {{is the first}} of its type from the brand, and has been developed in-house by Kia’s research and development teams at its Namyang, Korea R&D centre. More fuel efficient than Kia’s existing six-speed automatic transmission, the new DCT has been engineered with low fuel consumption and a sporty driving feel when in manual mode, and with comfort and smoothness when left in automatic mode. [...] Innovative hollow double-gear input shaft allows quick shifts. The DCT is made up of two dry clutches, each fitted with electric <b>motor-driven</b> clutch <b>actuator</b> to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear input shaft. The hollow shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed gear shifting enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project. The hollow shaft mechanism lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear that the driver is likely to need next under acceleration or braking, or jump immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kickdown or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain in control of the vehicle at all times. The continuous power delivery of the DCT minimises the loss of torque and forward motion by the powertrain during gear shifts, resulting in more decisive acceleration and a smoother drive. This contributes towards the transmission’s boost to performance in all road conditions in its first application in the Cee’d GT line. Combined with an increase in power from 128 to 133 ps, the DCT’s seven gears allow the GT Line’s diesel engine to operate at its most efficient speeds at all times. With the engine’s torque increased from 265 to 285 Nm, the new DCT is engineered to effectively manage outputs up to 300 Nm, achieving a better balance between the engine’s improved, more effortless performance and potential for greater fuel economy. Reduction of noise, vibration and harshness has also been a focus for the team behind the DCT’s development, with an external damper ensuring a higher level of refinement for the new transmission.After the Cee’d GT line, which will go on sale across Europe in Q4 2015, the new seven-speed DCT will be made available on a range of other Kia models.|$|R
40|$|Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) {{are defined}} as a class of {{vehicles}} with their larger dimension not exceeding 15 cm and weighing 100 gm. The three main approaches for providing lift for such vehicles are through fixed, rotating and flapping wings. The flapping wing MAVs are more efficient in the low Reynolds-number regime than conventional wings and rotors. Natural flapping ﬂyers, such as birds and insects, serve as a natural source of inspiration {{for the development of}} MAV. Flapping wing design {{is one of the major}} challenges to develop an MAV because it is not only responsible for the lift, but also propulsion and maneuvers. Two important issues are addressed in this thesis: (1) an equivalent beam-type modeling of actual insect wing is proposed based on the experimental data and (2) development of the numerical framework for design and analysis of insect scale smart flapping wing. The experimental data is used for structural modeling of the blowfly Calliphora wing as a stepped cantilever beam with nine spanwise sections of varying mass per unit lengths, flexural rigidity (EI) and torsional rigidity (GJ) values. Natural frequencies, both in bending and torsion, are obtained by solving the homogeneous part of the respective governing differential equations using the finite element method. It is found that natural frequency in bending and torsion are 3. 17 and 1. 57 times higher than flapping frequency of Calliphora wing, respectively. The results provide guidelines for the biomimetic structural design of insect-scale flapping wings. In addition to the structural modeling of the insect wing, development of the biomimetic mechanisms played a very important role to achieve a deeper insight of the flapping ﬂight. Current biomimetic flapping wing mechanisms are either dynamically scaled or rely on pneumatic and <b>motor-driven</b> flapping <b>actuators.</b> Unfortunately, these mechanisms become bulky and flap at very low frequency. Moreover, mechanisms designed with conventional actuators lead to high weight and system-complexity which makes it difficult to mimic the complex wingbeat kinematics of the natural flyers. The usage of the actuator made of smart materials such as ionic polymer metal composites (IPMCs) and piezoceramics to design flapping wings is a potential alternative. IPMCs are a relatively new type of smart material that belongs to the family of Electroactive Polymers (EAP) which is also known as “artificial muscles”. In this work, structural modeling and aerodynamic analysis of a dragonﬂy inspired IPMC flapping wing are performed using numerical simulations. An optimization study is performed to obtain improved flapping actuation of the IPMC wing. Later, a comparative study of the performances of three IPMC flapping wings having the same size as the actual wings of three different dragonﬂy species Aeshna Multicolor, Anax Parthenope Julius and Sympetrum Frequens is conducted. It is found that the IPMC wing generates sufficient lift to support its own weight and carry a small payload. In addition to the IPMC, piezoelectric materials are also considered to design a dragonfly inspired flapping wing because they have several attractive features such as high bandwidth, high output force, compact size and high power density. The wings of birds and insects move through a large angle which may be obtained using piezofan through large deflection. Piezofan which is one of the simple motion amplifying mechanisms couples a piezoelectric unimorph to an attached flexible wing and is competent to produce large deflection especially at resonance. Non-linear dynamic model for the piezoelectrically actuated flapping wing is done using energy method. It is shown that flapping angle variations of the smart flapping wing are similar to the actual dragonfly wing for a specific feasible voltage. Subsequently, a comparative study of the performances of three piezoelectrically actuated flapping wings is performed. Numerical results show that the ﬂapping wing based on geometry of dragonfly Sympetrum Frequens wing is suitable for low speed flight and it represents a potential candidate for use in insect scale micro air vehicles. In this study, single crystal piezoceramic is also considered for the flapping wing design because they are the potential new generation materials and have attracted considerable attention due to superior electromechanical properties. It is found that the use of single crystal piezoceramic can lead to considerable amount of wing weight reduction and increase of aerodynamic forces compared to conventional piezoelectric materials such as PZT- 5 H. It can also be noted that natural fliers flap their wings in a vertical plane with a change in the pitch of the wings during a ﬂapping cycle. In order to capture this particular feature of the wingbeat kinematics, coupled flapping-twisting non-linear dynamic modeling of piezoelectrically actuated flapping wing is done using energy method. Excitation by the piezoelectric harmonic force generates only the flap bending motion, which in turn, induces the elastic twist motion due to interaction between flexural and torsional vibrations modes. It is found that the value of average lift reaches to its maximum when the smart flapping wing is excited at a frequency closer to the natural frequency in torsion. Moreover, consideration of the elastic twisting of flapping wing leads to an increase in the lift force...|$|R
