40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{comparative}} description and classification of cabinets, ministers and prime ministers duration in Central Eastern Europe. It first defines {{the date of}} the “birth” of democratic cabinet “life” in post-communist countries. Second, it describes systematically the duration of post-communist cabinets, ministers and prime ministers during the first fourteen years (1990 - 2003). This research addresses the following questions: Which are the first democratic governments (founding cabinets) in post-communist Central Eastern Europe (CEE) ? What are the appropriate indicators for <b>measuring</b> <b>cabinet</b> duration in CEE? What are the patterns of cabinet, ministerial, and prime ministerial duration in these countries? Do the theoretical assumptions and empirical findings about the duration of coalition types, which have been developed in the cabinet structure approach hold true for CEE cabinets? Which are the most stable cabinet systems in CEE...|$|E

50|$|In 1977 Andreotti {{dealt with}} an {{economic}} crisis by criticising the luxury lifestyle of many Italians and pushing through tough austerity <b>measures.</b> This <b>cabinet</b> fell in January 1978. In March, the crisis was overcome by the intervention of Moro, who proposed a new cabinet, again formed only by DC politicians, but this time with positive confidence votes from the other parties, including the PCI. This cabinet was also chaired by Andreotti, and was formed on 16 March 1978.|$|R
50|$|Born in Uherské Hradiště, Nečas earned {{doctor of}} natural {{sciences}} degree in physics at Masaryk University in Brno. In 1991, {{he was one}} of the co-founders of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS). Becoming an MP in 1993, he served as a member of the Foreign Committee of the Chamber of Deputies and three years later, he became Chairman of the Committee on Security. In 2006, Nečas was appointed as Minister of Labour and Social Affairs under leadership of Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek. In the Chamber of Deputies, he was given nickname Fidel by the communist MPs due to his long filibustering. The 2010 legislative election led to Nečas becoming Prime Minister as the head of the coalition government with TOP 09 and Public Affairs (VV) (later replaced by Liberal Democrats). His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity <b>measures.</b> <b>Cabinet</b> led by Nečas pushed on restitutions of the properties of the Christian Churches, pensionary reform and reform of the colleges, all of the mentioned were deeply unpopular and criticized.|$|R

40|$|Biological safety {{cabinets}} {{are frequently}} relied upon to provide sterile work {{environments in which}} hazardous microorganisms can be safely handled. Verification of correct airstream velocities does not, by itself, ensure that adequate protection will be achieved under all users. Instead, the concentration of microorganisms in a cabinet operator's breathing zone must be <b>measured</b> during typical <b>cabinet</b> use conditions {{to determine whether the}} exposure is below acceptable limits. In this study, cabinet operator exposures were measured with a personal air sampler. Bacterial spores were released inside a cabinet as a uniform challenge aerosol, and the number of escaping spores was <b>measured</b> for several <b>cabinet</b> arrangements during a number of typical operations. The following were studied to determine their effects on aerosol containment: inflow air velocity, size of access opening, type of operator movements, location of operator's hands, and pace of activity. Other experiments examined differences in aerosol containment for eight typical microbiology operations when performed by six operators who covered a range of body heights and volumes...|$|R

6000|$|The {{bill was}} again {{passed through the}} Commons in 1872. Mr. Gladstone was {{prepared}} for strong <b>measures.</b> The <b>cabinet</b> decided that if the House of Lords should hold to what the prime minister styled “the strange provision for optional secrecy,” the government would withdraw the bill and try an autumn session, and if the Lords still hardened their hearts, “there would remain nothing but the last alternative to consider,”—these words, I assume, meaning a dissolution. Perhaps the opposition thought that a dissolution on the ballot might give to the ministerial Antæus fresh energy. This time the Lords gave way, satisfied that the Measure had now at last been more adequately discussed,—the said discussion really consisting in {{no more than an}} adequate amount of violent language out of doors against the principle of a hereditary legislature.(241) ...|$|R
50|$|In 1967, O'Neill sacked his Minister of Agriculture, Harry West, for ministerial impropriety, and Chichester-Clark was {{appointed}} in his place, {{a position he}} retained for two quiet years. On 23 April 1969, he resigned from the Cabinet one day prior to a crucial Parliamentary Party meeting, claiming that he disagreed with the Prime Minister's decision to grant universal suffrage in local government elections at that time. He stated that he disagreed not with the principle of {{one man one vote}} but with the timing of the decision, having the previous day expressed doubts over the expediency of the <b>measure</b> in <b>Cabinet.</b> It has since been suggested that his resignation was in order to accelerate O'Neill's own resignation, and to improve his own position in the jostling to succeed him.|$|R
50|$|Courbet's proposals, {{although}} militarily attractive, {{were too}} ambitious for the French government to stomach. The French premier Jules Ferry fought the Sino-French War {{in the teeth}} of parliamentary disapproval, and was unable to give Courbet the resources necessary for a major campaign on the Chinese mainland. A limited operation to seize Keelung, on the other hand, could be undertaken with the forces already at Courbet's disposal. The town could be taken and held by a relatively small French force, and with its nearby coal mines would make an admirable wartime base for the Far East Squadron. A victory at Keelung would also avenge the failure of 6 August. The decision to attack Keelung was made by the French cabinet on 18 September 1884. For good <b>measure,</b> the <b>cabinet</b> also sanctioned an attack on nearby Tamsui, provided that the town could be captured without damage to European commercial interests.|$|R
50|$|Since reforms by the Cabinet Office in 2013, the Maundy Thursday (Easter) and Christmas {{privilege}} {{days are}} no longer available for new civil servants. For civil servants who were in their positions when the changes came into force, these 1.5 days have been converted into additional annual leave. Because the Queen's Birthday privilege day was granted by the Queen, {{it would have been}} difficult for the Cabinet Office to abolish it by an administrative <b>measure,</b> so the <b>Cabinet</b> Office decided to retain this day as a privilege day.|$|R

25|$|Cabinet Committees {{will often}} discuss matters {{referred}} to them by Cabinet itself, and then report back {{the results of their}} deliberation.

50|$|Following the {{election}} and selection of a Prime Minister he accepted {{a position in the}} new Cabinet, as Minister for Health. On 13 January, however, he resigned from Cabinet, in protest against the inclusion in Cabinet of members from outside Parliament (to positions which he stated could have been entrusted to members of his party), and also to express his refusal to sign an agreement which would have prevented him from voting (in Parliament) against <b>measures</b> endorsed by <b>Cabinet,</b> based on the principle of collective Cabinet responsibility. Although there is no formal Opposition, Pōhiva was, from then on, considered the de facto opposition leader.|$|R

5000|$|It was {{the issue}} of Ireland which precipitated the end of Grey's premiership in 1834. Lord Anglesey, the Viceroy of Ireland, {{preferred}} conciliatory reform including the partial redistribution of the income from the church tithe to the Catholic church {{and away from the}} established Protestant one, a policy known as “appropriation”. [...] The Chief Secretary for Ireland, Lord Stanley, however, preferred coercive <b>measures.</b> [...] The <b>cabinet</b> was divided and when Lord John Russell drew attention in the House of Commons to their differences over [...] "appropriation", Stanley and others resigned. [...] This triggered Grey to retire from public life, leaving Lord Melbourne as his successor. Unlike most politicians, he seems to have genuinely preferred a private life; colleagues remarked caustically that he threatened to resign at every setback.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} autocracies and weakly {{institutionalized}} countries is plagued by scarcity {{of information about}} the relative strength of different players within the political sys-tem. This paper presents novel data on the composition of government coalitions in a sample of fifteen post-colonial African countries suited to this task. We emphasize the role of the executive branch as the central fulcrum of all national political systems in our sample, especially relative to other institutional bodies such as the legislative assembly. Leveraging on the impressive body of work documenting the crucial role of ethnic fragmentation as a main driver of political and social friction in Africa, the paper further details the construction of ethnic composition <b>measures</b> for executive <b>cabinets.</b> We discuss how this novel source of information may help shed light on the inner workings of typically opaque African political elites...|$|R
2500|$|Cabinets {{need to be}} {{maintained}} on a regular schedule. During this certification check, the airflow and the filter capacities are verified. The filters have a limited lifespan - determined by the air quality within the laboratory space {{and the amount of}} particles and aerosols generated inside the BSC' work zone. As these filters load, the internal fan is required to do more work to push/pull the same volume of air through them. Newer <b>cabinets</b> <b>measure</b> the air flow constantly and self compensate fan performance to ensure constant volumes of air moving through the filters and the cabinet. If the flow drops below desired performance an audio and visual alarm will alert the operator. Changing the filter should be limited to trained persons as the filter is potentially contaminated. This can be done either after the cabinet has been decontaminated using a gaseous procedure (using Formaldehyde, Chlorine Dioxide or Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide) or a [...] "bag-in/bag-out" [...] procedure.|$|R
40|$|A {{worldwide}} {{comparison of}} national CO_ 2 -reduction targets demonstrates that Germany {{is among the}} leaders in setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In 1987 the German Bundestag established an Enquete Commission on 'Preventive Measures to Protect the Earth's Atmosphere'. In its third report published in fall 1990 the Commission developed a CO_ 2 -reduction plan and proposed a 30 % reduction target for CO_ 2 emissions by the year 2005 compared to 1987. Based on this analysis the German Cabinet has taken up the issue and voted for a 25 - 30 % reduction target including former East Germany. An interministerial working group (IMA) has been established to prepare the adoption of policy <b>measures.</b> The Federal <b>Cabinet</b> {{is expected to make}} a final decision on the measures prepared so far in this month. In this presentation both the plan to reduce CO_ 2 emissions and the measures already implemented, proposed or discussed to reach that target are described.

50|$|Herring's {{subsequent}} works {{concentrate on}} encodings, decodings and meta-language, but {{the elements of}} chance and process are still present. In 1970 Herring exhibited in Idea Structures with Keith Arnatt, Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Victor Burgin, Harold Hurrell and Joseph Kosuth at the Camden Arts Centre. His work, Proposition, consisted of a small filing <b>cabinet</b> <b>measuring</b> 16 x 20 x 39 cm (a single drawer of card files). Inside were some 400 cards, {{most of which were}} blank. During the weeks prior to the exhibition Herring had asked 50 people to keep one card in their possession for a week, {{at the end of which}} the used card was collected by the artist. A new card was then given to each person, replacing the used one. The process was repeated seven times, thus yielding a total of 400 cards, minus a number of cards that were accidentally lost. The artist then selected 8 of the used cards, one card from each week's collection, and had the centre of the card micro-graphed (a photographic process that records the microscopic detail of the subject, in this case the actual fibres of the paper card). The micro-graphs were then inserted at regular intervals in the body of 400 blank cards.|$|R
