40|$|Pit lakes (abandoned flooded mine pits) {{represent}} a potentially valuable water resource. However, acid mine drainage (AMD) generation due to mining activities {{often results in}} pit lake waters with low pH, high sulphate and dissolved metal concentrations. Sulphate reduction-based bioremediation offers tremendous scope for removal of acidity and metals from pit lake water. In this study, the effect of storing sewage on its carbon quality for bioremediation of acidic pit lake water was studied. In addition, the effectiveness of labile organic carbon (lactic acid and ethanol) on SRB activity was tested. Bioremediation experiments were performed in controlled and replicated microcosms with acidic (pH 2. 2) water from a pit lake by addition of stored (3 years at 4 °C) sewage for stimulation of sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) activity. This sewage had been previously used successfully in remediating to pH 7 water from this pit lake. The initial aim was to test the sewage at lower doses (18 and 28 g/L) and in a pulsed addition (over 5 weeks). Bioremediation efficacy was evaluated by <b>measuring</b> <b>pit</b> lake water pH increase, redox potential decrease, and acidity and sulphate removal. Though the stored sewage had retained a very similar high total organic carbon (TOC) equivalent to prior to storage, it failed to increase dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels in pit lake water. Microcosms amended with doubled doses of sewage and an extended remediation time still failed to demonstrate any substantial improvement in water quality, other than {{a small amount of}} sulphate reduction and direct neutralisation by the sewage. In order to determine if low DOC concentrations in sewage were the cause of the bioremediation failure, labile organic carbon (LOC), consisting of 50 : 50 (w/w) lactic acid and ethanol, was added to all microcosm treatments at concentrations of 3000, 6000 and 9000 mg/L. After LOC addition, water quality improved with effective removal of acidity, sulphate and metals in the lowest carbon concentration (3000 mg/L). However, 6000 and 9000 mg/L LOC concentrations showed a delay in response due to the increased acidity associated with the lactic acid addition. The experiments showed that pulsed dosing of carbon simply slowed the commencement of remediation but it was ultimately able to reach the same effectiveness as the equivalent quantity added all at once. Prolonged storage of sewage leads to loss of LOC. In situ pit lake remediations which aim to make use of sewage as the main carbon source will need to factor in the storage time required to obtain sufficient sewage for the treatment into the design. Pulsing may help reduce issues with storage or supplementation with LOC may need to be considered. Results highlight that LOC is a more useful indicator of material effectiveness compared to a simple measures of TOC...|$|E

Several leaching tables were constructed to simulate weathering reactions and surface water run-off in the major pit wall units during a 200 -day leaching experiment. To date, about three-quarters through the experiment, combined run-off from these cells has reached a pH < 4, corresponding to actual present day pit water pH values and chemistries.

Antlion pits that were given supplemental heat grew at a faster rate than controls. We also compared weight and pit diameters of at least 15 animals from seven sites between Sturgeon Bay and Pine Point. No significant difference was found between any site or lakeshore, though our data suggested that the original Sturgeon Bay study site displayed a larger pit size than any other site.

40|$|Although pitting {{corrosion}} in passive materials is generally well understood, {{the growth of}} surface pits in actively-corroding materials has received much less attention to date and remains poorly understood. One of the key challenges which exists is repeatedly and reliably generating surface pits in a practical time-frame {{in the absence of}} deformation and/or residual stress so that studies on pit propagation and healing can be performed. Another pertinent issue is how to evaluate pitting while addressing general corrosion in low carbon steel. In this work, potentiostatic polarisation was employed to induce corrosion pits (free from deformation or residual stress) on actively corroding X 65 carbon steel. The influence of applied potential (50 mV, 100 mV and 150 mV vs open circuit potential) was investigated over 24 h in a CO 2 -saturated, 3. 5 wt. % NaCl solution at 30 °C and pH 3. 8.

A detailed geological assessment of the pit walls indicated that the wall surface area consists of 13 % sulfidic dacite, 32 % sulfidic rhyolite, 12 % sulfidic breccia, 10 % metasediments, 12 % alluvial sediments, and 17 % massive sulfides (pyrite-chalcopyrite-sphalerite). The massive sulphide occurs partly as backfill in disused pit areas. Several leaching tables were constructed to simulate weathering reactions and surface water runoff in the major pit wall units during a 200 -day leaching experiment. While sulphide oxidation in the pitwalls will produce acid metal rich leachate, bicarbonate rich groundwater inflow {{during the dry season}} acts as a weak buffer. The kinetic test data have been combined with <b>measured</b> <b>pit</b> water chemistry data, measured surface and seasonal groundwater inflows, climatic data, and calculated pit lake surface area and volume to produce a high resolution hydrological and geochemical pit water model.

After 20 years the pit lake will start to flood the uncapped sulfide waste rock in the disused pit area.

The optical properties and thicknesses of the samples were obtained by ex situ spectroscopic ellipsometry. The surface morphologies of the CdTe epilayers were analyzed by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Nomarski microscopy before and after chemical etching. We compare the triangle- and trapezoid-shaped etch pits due to the Everson and Nakagawa etch solutions, respectively. <b>Measured</b> etch <b>pit</b> density (EPD) values of triangle etch pits {{were found in the}} 8 × 107 cm− 2 to 2 × 108 cm− 2 range, and trapezoid-shaped etch pits were found in the 1 × 107 cm− 2 to 7 × 107 cm− 2 range for samples with thicknesses < 2 μm.
