40|$|With the {{increase}} in urbanization and energy consumption, PM 2. 5 {{has become a major}} pollutant. This paper investigates the impact of <b>road</b> <b>patterns</b> on PM 2. 5 pollution in Beijing, focusing on two questions: Do <b>road</b> <b>patterns</b> significantly affect PM 2. 5 concentrations? How do <b>road</b> <b>patterns</b> affect PM 2. 5 concentrations? A land-use regression model (LUR model) is used to quantify the associations between PM 2. 5 concentrations, and <b>road</b> <b>patterns,</b> land-use patterns, and population density. Then, in the condition of excluding other factors closely correlated to PM 2. 5 concentrations, {{based on the results of}} the regression model, further research is conducted to explore the relationship between PM 2. 5 concentrations and the types, densities, and layouts of road networks, through the controlling variables method. The results are as follows: (1) the regression coefficient of <b>road</b> <b>patterns</b> is significantly higher than the water area, population density, and transport facilities, indicating that <b>road</b> <b>patterns</b> have an obvious influence on PM 2. 5 concentrations; (2) under the same traffic carrying capacity, the layout of “a tight network of streets and small blocks” is superior to that of “a sparse network of streets and big blocks”; (3) the grade proportion of urban roads impacts the road patterns’ rationality, and a high percentage of branch roads and secondary roads could decrease PM 2. 5 concentrations. These findings could provide a reference for the improvement of the traffic structure and air quality of Beijing...|$|R

40|$|Predictability {{of summer}} climate {{anomalies}} over East Asia and the northwestern Pacific is investigated using observations and a multimodel hindcast ensemble initialized on 1 May {{for the recent}} 20 – 30 yr. Summertime East Asia is {{under the influence of}} the northwestern Pacific subtropical high (PASH). The Pacific–Japan (PJ) teleconnection pattern, a meridional dipole of sea level pressure variability, affects the northwestern PASH. The forecast models generally capture the association of the PJ pattern with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The Silk <b>Road</b> <b>pattern,</b> a wave train along the summer Asian jet, is another dominant teleconnection that influences the northwestern PASH and East Asia. In contrast to the PJ pattern, observational analysis reveals a lack of correlations between the Silk <b>Road</b> <b>pattern</b> and ENSO. Coupled models cannot predict the temporal phase of the Silk <b>Road</b> <b>pattern,</b> despite their ability to reproduce its spatial structure as the leading mode of atmospheric internal variability. Thus, the pattern is rather unpredictable at monthly to seasonal lead, limiting the seasonal predictability for summer in East Asia. The anomalous summer of 2010 in East Asia is a case in point, illustrating the interference by the Silk <b>Road</b> <b>pattern.</b> Canonical anomalies associated with a decayed El Niño and developing La Niña would have the P...|$|R
50|$|The village’s name, Wahnwegen, {{means an}} den Wagenwegen, or “on the wain ways” (or for “wain”, read “wagon”, “cart”, “carriage”, etc., as Wagen can mean {{all these things}} in German). This refers to the village’s {{location}} at a crossroads, where <b>mediaeval</b> <b>roads</b> crossed. The name first appears as Wanwgen in 1446 in a steward’s account from Lichtenberg Castle. That same year, the name also cropped up in documents as Wanwinden, Wangwegen and Wernswinden. It was also called Wangwegen in 1578. The interpretation of the name’s meaning as {{something to do with}} the old crossroads is not shared by all researchers. Alternative interpretations see the first syllable as coming from a personal name, perhaps Werni, and the ending —wegen or —winden as meaning bei den Weiden (“by the meadows”, or perhaps “by the willows”).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the {{properties}} of <b>road</b> network <b>patterns</b> by considering the relationship between neighborhood intersections. The Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG), which is one of the proximity graph, is used to analyze the <b>road</b> network <b>patterns</b> of major cities in the United States as a network construction model. The grid-tree proportion (GTP) index and the crossing factor (CF) are used to compare road networks with regular <b>road</b> <b>patterns.</b> Each link in the proximity graphs using the point data of intersections on a digital map is compared with road links.

40|$|International audienceThe {{navigation}} of {{an autonomous}} vehicle {{is a highly}} complex task and the dynamic environment {{is used as a}} source for reasoning. Road detection is a major issue in autonomous systems and advanced driving assistance systems applied for inner-city. Uncertainty may arise in environments with unmarked or weakly marked roads or poor lightning conditions. Moreover, when a common benchmark is not used, it is hard to decide which approach performs better on the road detection problem. This paper introduces a comprehensive performance analysis of two road recognition approaches using the urban Kitti-road benchmark. The first approach makes the extraction of a feature set based on statistical measures of 2 D and 3 D information from each superpixel. An Artificial Neural Network is used to detect the <b>road</b> <b>pattern.</b> The second approach extracts the feature set based on a multi-normalized histogram of Textons and Disptons for each superpixel. This feature set is used as a source for a Joint Boosting algorithm to model the <b>road</b> <b>pattern.</b> The proposed work presents a detailed evaluation highlighting {{the pros and cons of}} each approach...|$|R
