5|$|Basiliscus {{was then}} {{acclaimed}} as Augustus on 9 January 475 at the Hebdomon palace, by the palace ministers and the Senate. The <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople got its revenge against Zeno, killing {{almost all of}} the Isaurians left in the city.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{meeting on}} May 30 nearly ended in disaster. Waite and several local civic leaders called union {{president}} Calderwood and mine owners Hagerman and Moffat {{to a conference}} in a meeting hall {{on the campus of}} Colorado College in Colorado Springs. Talks were under way and proceeding well when a <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> local citizens attempted to storm the building. Blaming Calderwood and Waite for the violence in Cripple Creek, they intended to lynch both men. As a local judge distracted the mob, Calderwood and Waite escaped out a rear door and onto the governor's waiting train.|$|E
5|$|In 1595 Żółkiewski {{participated in}} the Moldavian {{campaign}} and the battle of Cecora near the Prut river. The following year he defeated the Cossack uprising of Severyn Nalivaiko. Żółkiewski was a known supporter of Cossack grievances, and generally favored peaceful negotiations with them. When the Cossacks surrendered Nalivaiko and other leaders of the uprising to him he guaranteed their fair treatment. But Nalivaiko was subsequently executed in Warsaw, and a <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> Polish soldiers massacred the other prisoners, {{which led to a}} deterioration in Polish-Cossack relations. In 1600 Żółkiewski returned to Moldova, where he took part in the victorious battle of Bukowo.|$|E

5|$|McCausland's Brigade was on {{the south}} side of the South Branch of the Potomac River. The 14th Virginia Cavalry, {{commanded}} by Captain Edwin E. Bouldin, was the portion of McCausland's Brigade camped closest to the ford where the road crossed the river. Bouldin faced a <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> men crossing the river that consisted of a mix of Union and Confederate soldiers. For a short while, he was able to slow down Gibson's Brigade—which was becoming scattered and disorganized. After hearing the gunfire, Lieutenant Colonel John T. Radford ordered the 22nd Virginia Cavalry into the fray. Radford's cavalry rode to the west side of the 14th Virginia, and joined the fight.|$|E
5|$|PC Blakelock {{had been}} {{assigned}} {{on the night of}} his death to Serial 502, a unit of 10 constables and one sergeant dispatched to protect firefighters. When the rioters forced the officers back, Blakelock stumbled and fell. Surrounded by a <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> 30–50 people, he received over 40 injuries inflicted by machetes or similar, and was found with a six-inch-long knife in his neck, buried up to the hilt. He was the first constable to be killed in a riot in Britain since 1833, when PC Robert Culley was stabbed to death in Clerkenwell, London.|$|E
5|$|Stuart Lake {{described}} {{in his book}} how Earp single-handedly stood down a large crowd that wanted to lynch gambler Michael O'Rourke (Johnny Behind the Deuce). O'Rourke had killed Henry Schneider, chief engineer of the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company—he said in self defense. Henry was well-liked, and a <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> miners quickly gathered, threatening to lynch O'Rourke on the spot. In fact, the Epitaph gave primary credit to Ben Sippy for standing down the crowd, assisted by Virgil Earp, Wyatt Earp, and Johnny Behan. This incident as described by Lake added to Earp's modern legend as a lawman.|$|E

5|$|The {{massacre}} at Rock Springs led to other incidents of anti-Chinese aggression, primarily in Washington Territory, {{though there were}} incidents in Oregon and other states as well. Near Newcastle, Washington a <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> whites burned down the barracks of 36 Chinese coal miners. Throughout the Puget Sound area, Chinese workers were driven out of communities and subject to violence in Washington cities and towns, including Tacoma, Seattle, Newcastle, and Issaquah. Chinese workers were driven out of other Washington towns, but sources indicated, as early as 1891, that the above events were specifically connected to the wave of violence touched off at Rock Springs.|$|E

On the eve of November 5, Evey visits V, who shows her an explosive-laden train in the abandoned London Underground, set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it. V meets Party Leader Creedy, with whom he made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler's execution. After Creedy executes Sutler, V reneges on his deal and kills Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, he returns to Evey and tells her he loves her before dying.|$|E
5|$|During the trip, Homer {{falls asleep}} and wakes up {{abruptly}} {{at the wheel}} of the truck due to taking a combination of pep pills and sleeping pills that he bought at a general store. He awakes to discover that the truck drove by itself with its Navitron Autodrive System. He informs other truck drivers, who inform him that he cannot let anyone know about the Autodrive system because it would make all truck drivers lose their jobs. However, Homer tells the passengers of a passing bus about the system, which causes an angry <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> truckers to go after Homer. But even after the Autodrive system ejects itself from Homer's semi, Homer is able to escape from the angry trucker mob. Homer and Bart arrive in Atlanta to finish Red's shipment on time, and then commandeer a train full of napalm so they can return to Springfield.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the novel, the narrator, and by extension McGregor, treats disorganized workers with scorn; from the miners of Coal Creek, to the downtrodden laborers of Chicago who are shown mastered by their bosses (unlike McGregor, who does not follow this trend). It is when McGregor comes back to Coal Creek to bury his mother and sees the usually jumbled miners marching in step as part of the funeral procession does he have an epiphany that together the workers are a powerful force, to be organized specifically by him. Indeed, this realization is foreshadowed in Chapter 3 of Book I when as a young man he sees a troupe of marching soldiers disperse a rowdy <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> miner's (and, as a consequence, save his family's bakery) during a strike.|$|E
5|$|Hellenistic culture did not {{supplant}} native Egyptian culture, as the Ptolemies supported time-honored {{traditions in}} an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace. They built new temples in Egyptian style, supported traditional cults, and portrayed themselves as pharaohs. Some traditions merged, as Greek and Egyptian gods were syncretized into composite deities, such as Serapis, and classical Greek forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs. Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion, bitter family rivalries, and the powerful <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria that formed after the death of Ptolemy IV. In addition, as Rome relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt, the Romans took great interest in the political situation in the country. Continued Egyptian revolts, ambitious politicians, and powerful Syriac opponents from the Near East made this situation unstable, leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Savage began {{a ten-year}} stay in San Francisco. He worked {{with his father}} and brother on an iron foundry enterprise, and served two years as colonel of the 2nd Regiment California National Guard. Savage took a {{prominent}} role in the civic and social life of the city, and was often called upon to make extemporaneous speeches to large crowds, a skill on which politician and economist Henry George complimented him. In January 1878, Savage served as chief military executive officer of the Committee of Safety, a group set up to oppose Denis Kearney and his riotous <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> angry supporters who {{wanted to get rid of}} Chinese immigrants. Savage's calm and logical presence was seen by San Franciscans as a rallying point for law and order during the riots. Savage renewed the friendship of his childhood schoolmate, now Bohemian Club poet Charles Warren Stoddard. He made the acquaintance of writer Archibald Clavering Gunter, who would later publish some of Savage's stories.|$|E

5|$|It was {{alleged that}} the police helped the mob against the Muslim {{community}} {{on the day of}} massacre. Evidence included complaints filed by victims' family members which state that police officials fired bullets and helped the mob, resulting in the killings. It was also alleged that police guided the <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> rioters to residents' hiding places. According to Human Rights Watch, the police did nothing as houses and people were burnt and, {{on the day of the}} violence, did not respond to telephone calls until the massacre ended. Numerous eyewitnesses saw police aiming tear gas shells at, and firing upon, Muslim youths who tried to defend themselves or others. There also have been allegations that police themselves burnt houses and looted. In the violence, the extensive use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was reported, which was cited as evidence of the involvement of officials because of easy access to it.|$|E
5|$|Murat and Kellermann {{immediately}} {{pounced on}} the supporting Liechtenstein Dragoons who were {{too slow to}} respond and routed them as well. The fleeing Austrian horsemen crashed {{into the ranks of}} Pilatti's rattled troopers and carried them away. As the <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> terrified cavalry stampeded past them, the exhausted Austrian infantry of the main body lost heart, provoking a wild rush to the rear. The gun teams fled, pursued by French cavalry, while their whole infantry line advanced westward. The second grenadier brigade under GM Karl Philippi von Weidenfeld and some unpanicked cavalry delayed Boudet’s advance long enough for O’Reilly’s cavalry to return, and together with Frimont, they mounted a last defense around Marengo village as night fell, allowing the Austrian centre to reach safety behind the Bormida. Ott with the Austrian left failed to intervene and found his retreat through Castel Ceriolo blocked by French troops advancing northwest from the centre, but managed to fight {{his way back to the}} Bormida bridgehead.|$|E
5|$|Nativist {{sentiment}} {{increased in}} St. Louis {{during the late}} 1840s, leading to mob attacks and riots in 1844, 1849, and 1852. The 1844 riots derived from popular outrage and resentment toward human dissection, which was then taking place at the Saint Louis University Medical College. The discovery of human remains prompted rumors of grave robbing, and a <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> more than 3,000 residents attacked the medical college, destroying most of its interior facilities. The worst nativist riot in St. Louis took place in 1854. The local militia was used to end the fighting. 10 people were killed, 33 wounded, and 93 buildings were damaged. Regulations on elections prevented fighting in future elections in 1856 and 1858.|$|E

50|$|A {{rat plague}} caused {{considerable}} damage at Coorabulka {{and the surrounding}} areas in 1940. The station manager estimated that 4000 sq mi of grazing lands was ruined by the plague with grass roots being destroyed and young trees being debarked. Reports came from travellers seeing <b>mobs</b> <b>of</b> thousands of rats along the roads.|$|R
5|$|On May 6, nativists {{returned}} in greater numbers. During the rally, {{it began to}} rain, and the meeting was moved into a nearby market. The inflammatory remarks continued inside the market, where fighting broke out between the local Irish Catholics and the nativists. Fighting spilled outside the market, where nativists were shot at by people {{in the windows of}} nearby buildings. One or two nativists were reportedly killed. George Shiffler, an 18 year old leather worker, was the first nativist killed in the riots of 1844. A <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> nativists attacked the Seminary of the Sisters of Charity and several Catholic homes before the riot ended. Numerous people were injured, and two more nativists were killed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 May, a meeting was held in Southery, Norfolk. The group, {{including}} a Thomas Sindall, marched through Denver to Downham Market {{to meet with the}} magistrates at their weekly meeting at The Crown public house. Sindall was the only person known to have been at both the riots at Downham Market and Littleport. He was killed by troopers at Littleport—see below. The <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> 1,500, mainly men but some women, besieged The Crown until the magistrates agreed to allow a deputation of eight rioters inside to make their pleas: to have work and two-shillings (£) per day. The magistrates acceded to these demands, but they had already called the yeoman cavalry from Upwell, who arrived at 5pm. Backed by the troops, the Riot Act was then read in the market place by Reverend Dering, causing further tussles, which subsided after arrests started to be made.|$|E
5|$|One {{high-profile}} {{case that}} illustrated Bradley's opposition to racial violence {{was that of}} ex-slave George Dinning. After being emancipated, Dinning saved enough money to purchase a farm in Simpson County. On January 27, 1897, a <b>mob</b> <b>of</b> 25armed white men came to Dinning's farm, accused him of stealing hogs and chickens, and demanded he leave the county within 10days. Dinning denied being a thief and insisted several people in the county would vouch for his good character. The mob, enraged by Dinning's resistance, began firing on his house and wounded him twice. Dinning retrieved a gun from his house and fired into the mob, killing one man. The mob fled, and the next day, Dinning turned himself in to local officials. While he was in their custody, the mob returned to his farm, drove his family from their house, looted it, and razed it to the ground.|$|E
