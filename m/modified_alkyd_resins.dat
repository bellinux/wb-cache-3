The molecular weight and its distribution were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). The rheological properties were measured by Viscometer, and the drying time of film was obtained by drying recorder. The crosslinking reaction and weatherability were determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) {{was used to evaluate}} the curing kinetics. It was found that the nature of drying oils, neutralizing agents, and cosolvents would significantly influence on the molecular weight, viscosity, stability, drying time and curing kinetics of the paints. When the tung/castor oil, was used as resin generally it showed a higher molecular weight and viscosity than those using soybean or linseed oil. The diethylamine neutralizing agent for paints exhibited the best stability and lower viscosity, In contrast, ammonia exhibited lower stability. The paints which included the resin that using linseed oil,ammonia and butyl cellosolve (EGMBE), showing the fastest drying time for coating film. However, the drying time of the film was found to be significantly decreased, due to blending it with high imino methylated melamine resin. But the crosslinking peak was very weak on the FTIR plot. It was also found that below 109 ℃ during the solvent evaporation stage,the endothermic peak occurred and it would suppress the DSC exotherm associated with the autooxidation crosslinking reaction. However,the temperature was above 109 ℃,the solvent would be completely evaporated,and exothermic reaction would occur,therefore the crosslinking reaction of amino <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> at high temperature would be performed. It was found that the solvent may significantly influence on thermal behavior, and it was also found that the <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> with more iodine value and lower preexponential constant (InZ) and lower activation energy, generally it would have a short drying time. The physical and chemical properties of the coating film depended on the rate of evaporation and stability of the neutralizing agent and the number of unsaturated double bond and hydroxyl group of oil <b>modified</b> <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin.</b> The paints those including the neutralizing agent and using ammonia, showed the best film hardness and water-resistance; but the paint using diethylamine system, exhibited a higher thermal degradation than that of the other 2 kinds of neutralizing agents. Regarding the evaluation of paint which contained a drying oil, linseed oil modified resin, it had a higher film hardness. In contrast, a blend of the drying oil which soybean oil was used as modified resin, it showed both better water-resistance and thermal degradation-resistance. In addition, whatever the substrate was used as coating, {{it was found that the}} film had good flexibility after 15 cycles of cold and hot treatment. In order to qualify the weatherability, the coated wood was placed in the artificially accelerated weatherometer (enclosed carbon-arc type) for 240 hours. The paint system which included ammonia and soybean oil modified resin still maintained a higher gloss retention than that of the other formulations. In addition,the film of the coated wood appeared to have better appearance after 240 hours of exposure. According to the SRS-FTIR measurement, the absorption peak of the methoxyl group (915 cm- 1) and alkyl group (1376 cm- 1) disappeared after 240 hours of exposure. The absorption peak of the triazine ring (1556 cm- 1) disappeared after 268 hours, while the absorption peaks of the carbonyl group(1710 cm- 1, 1721 cm- 1) increased after 268 hours. It was found that the fastest drying time for coating film in air was the <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> containing 5 % trimethylol propane diallyl ether (TMPDAE). <b>Alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> containing 10 % or 15 % had a longer drying time, therefore it would not have any improved effect. With a relative humidity under 65 % and various temperature, it was found that in creasing the temperature resulted in an increased speed of the drying of the film. It also indicated the synergism of both temperature and relative humidity in affecting the drying rate of film. The <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> coating containing 5 % TMPDAE in air at 50 ℃ and under 45 % RH, 2 hours drying time would be required. When UV illumination was applied, the drying time was reduced to 1 hour. Under these condition, the drying time of film was 9 - 18 times faster than drying in air at 25 ℃ and under 65 %RH condition. With a DSC experiment, it was found that increasing the TMPDAE content, resulted in an increasing in the speed of the crosslinking reaction of the film. This indicated that the synergism of temperature and TMPDAE would affect the rate of crosslinking reaction. 高亞胺型甲基化三聚氰胺樹脂可作為水溶性醇酸樹脂之架橋劑，在不需添加酸觸媒下能夠調配氣乾型水性塗料。使用膠體滲透層析儀 (GPC) ， 霍氏 轉換紅外線光譜儀(FTIR) ，示差掃瞄熱卡儀(DSC) 及其他相關儀器 ，評估 樹脂塗料系統之性質及塗膜性能，結果歸納如下： 1. 樹脂塗料之分子量、黏度、穩定性、乾燥性、硬化動力學及塗膜物理 化學性能，主要受乾性油種類，中和劑種類所影響。桐油／篦麻油者 顯示最高分子量及黏度，依次為大豆油及亞麻仁油者；二乙胺中和之 塗料具有最佳穩定性及低黏度；氨者則穩定性最差，含亞麻仁油變性 之結合劑、氨中和劑及乙二醇單丁醚(EGMBE) 共溶劑之配方，塗膜乾 燥速度最快。 2.

A sharp variation of viscosity is only observed for <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins</b> having more than 40 % (w/w) of karawila seed oil. The polyesterification time was reduced and correspondingly the extent of polymerization was also reduced up to 30 % (w/w). Significant variation in transesterification time was also observed for 30 % (w/w). However, further increase in karawila seed oil above 40 % (w/w) had only a marginal effect on the polyesterification reaction. The drying properties of the <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins</b> had been significantly improved with the increase of karawila seed oil up to 30 % (w/w) but further increase in karawila seed oil resulted in poor drying characteristics. The film properties (drying time, hardness, adhesion, chemical resistance and gloss) of the <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins</b> were determined. The optimum film properties were recorded for the oil blend with 30 % (w/w) karawila seed oil and 70 % (w/w) soya bean oil...|$|R

40|$|Novel oxazoline-based comb-polymers {{possessing}} linoleyl or oleic {{side chains}} have been synthesized {{and used to}} produce low viscosity coatings. Inclusion of the polymers in model paint formulations results in coatings that exhibit faster drying times than commercially available <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> formulations. The comb polymers were produced from diol substituted oxazoline monomers that were synthesized through a scalable, solvent free protocol and purified by simple recrystallisation. Co-polymerisation of the oxazolines with adipic acid at 160 °C in the bulk resulted in the targeted polyester comb type polymers. The polymers were soluble {{in a range of}} organic solvents and compatible with commercial <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins.</b> Model paint formulations containing up to 40 wt% of the linoleyl-based comb polymers exhibited a dramatic reduction in viscosity (from 35 to 13 Poise at 25 °C) with increasing quantities of polymer added. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) studies revealed that the drying rate of the model paint formulations containing the comb polymers was enhanced when compared with that of commercial <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy with partial least squares (PLS) data analysis was evaluated for quantifying {{the components of}} mixtures of paint binding media and pigments, and <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins.</b> PLS methods were created using a number of standard mixtures. Validation and measurement uncertainty estimation was carried out. Binary, ternary and quaternary mixtures of several common binding media and pigments were quantified, with standard measurement uncertainties in most cases below 3 g/ 100 g. Classes of components - aromatic anhydrides and alcohols - used in <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> synthesis were also successfully quantified, with standard uncertainties {{in the range of}} 2 - 3 g/ 100 g. This is a more demanding application because in <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins</b> aromatic anhydrides and alcohols have reacted to form a polyester, and are not present in their original forms. Once a PLS method has been calibrated, analysis time and cost are significantly reduced from typical quantitative methods such as GC/MS. This is beneficial in the case of routine analysis where the components are known...|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE: <b>Alkyd</b> <b>resins</b> are {{synthetic}} polyesters used as {{paints and}} coatings. Current approaches for their analysis {{do not allow}} the characterization of pentaerythritol and phthalic acid esters, whose detection is interesting to fully characterize the materials, e. g. for forensic or cultural heritage applications. METHODS: A combined analytical approach based on Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), HighPerformance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) /MS and flow injection analysis (FIA) /MS was adopted. GC/MS was used to characterize the fatty acid profile and the polybasic acids in extracts from industrial <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins.</b> HPLC/MS and FIA/MS {{were used for the}} characterization of the triglyceride profile of the oil used to manufacture the resin and for the identification of reaction products deriving from the synthesis process. RESULTS: The multi-analytical approach was applied on two different industrial <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins</b> produced from two different oils. The GC/MS analysis was successful in characterizing the fatty acid profile and the aromatic fraction of the resin. The HPLC/MS analysis allowed us to characterize the pentaerythritol and phthalic acid ester and the triglycerides residues from the synthesis process, by studying their high-resolution tandem mass spectra. CONCLUSIONS: The application of liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry to the study of industrial <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins</b> allowed us to characterize {{for the first time the}} esters formed by the transesterification reactions involving pentaerythritol, phthalic acid and triglycerides.
