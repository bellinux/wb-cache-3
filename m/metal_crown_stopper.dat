Materials and Methods: The present study was carried out on 40 subjects, the purpose being to investigate the relation of oral perception to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Two types of cast metal crowns-one had morphology closely resembling original tooth and other one confirmed to ideal contours were constructed on endodontically treated posterior tooth. One cast <b>metal</b> <b>crown</b> was randomly selected from two cast <b>metal</b> <b>crown</b> and fitted on prepared tooth. Oral stereognostic score of subject was determined by correct response to questionnaire based on the recognition ability of subjects. Patient satisfaction level was checked by psychometric parameter Likert scale. Same procedure was repeated with other type of cast <b>metal</b> <b>crown.</b> Results: Data obtained were compared by paired and unpaired two sample t-test. Oral stereognostic score and satisfaction score were found to be higher for cast <b>metal</b> <b>crown</b> with morphology resembling to original tooth due to recognition and discriminatory ability of subjects and recall-memory. Oral stereognostic level was found to be higher in younger than older subjects. The level of satisfaction was found to be higher in older subjects than younger subjects.

40|$|Background : The {{design of}} the tooth {{preparation}} and the cementing medium are important consid-erations in the retention of crowns and fixed partial dentures. The purpose of this invitro {{study was to determine}} the effect of axial groove on the retention of complete cast <b>metal</b> <b>crowns</b> using two resin luting cements. Methods: Forty freshly extracted intact human molar teeth were prepared in their long axis to receive complete cast <b>metal</b> <b>crowns.</b> The specimens were randomly divided into two groups (one control and one study group). An axial groove of uniform size and shape was made on the prepared teeth under the study group. Axial surface area of prepared teeth specimens was measured. Complete cast <b>metal</b> <b>crowns</b> were fabricated for each specimen. Specimens of each group were divided into subgroups of 10 samples and were cemented with two resin luting cements, RelyX Unicem® and Calibra®, re-spectively. The cemented crowns were loaded in tension using a Universal Instron testing machine. The maximal tensile strength was recorded. Data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test (α= 0. 05). Results: No significant differences in the tensile stress values were noted between the control (mean: 5. 76 ± 0. 392 MPa) and study (mean: 5. 93 ± 0. 751 MPa) groups cemented with RelyX Unicem. No sig-nificant differences in the tensile stress values were noted between the control (mean: 4. 92 ± 0. 641 MPa) and study (mean: 5. 15 ± 0. 478 MPa) groups cemented with Calibra. However, significant dif-ference in the tensile stress values was found between the two resin cements in the control and study groups.

40|$|Statement of Problem: In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} the esthetic problem of metal collar in porcelain fused to <b>metal</b> <b>crowns</b> various techniques, such as shoulder porcelain, have been suggested. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of repeated porcelain firing cycles on the marginal integrity of shoulder in porcelain fused to <b>metal</b> <b>crowns,</b> made of two kinds of alloys: noble and base-metal. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, four groups of ten brazen models (Die) were used. <b>Metal</b> <b>crowns</b> of groups A&B were made of a noble alloy and those of C&D of a base-metal alloy. Groups A&C had the shoulder width of 1 mm and groups B&D had the shoulder width of 1. 5 mm. After degassing and opaqing, shoulder porcelain was completed in the area of shoulder. At this stage, the average vertical gap of margin was measured by a reflective microscope (&# 61620; 400). Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Duncan tests. Results: No simoltaneouse interaction between the type of alloy and the shoulder width was found (P= 0. 709). The type of alloy had a significant effect on marginal integrity (P= 0. 021) attributing the best marginal integrity of shoulder porcelain to base-metal alloys. Shoulder width played also a significant role on marginal integrity (P= 0. 00) indicating that the reduction of shoulder width would increase the marginal integrity. Conclusion: According to these findings, the best marginal integrity of shoulder porcelain is achieved through shoulder width of 1 mm along with base-metal alloys...|$|R

40|$|Context: Desensitizers {{are used}} to reduce dentin hypersensitivity. They affect the surface texture of {{prepared}} dentin and may alter the retention of fixed restorations. Aims: The aim was to evaluate the effect of dentin desensitizers on the retention of complete cast <b>metal</b> <b>crowns</b> luted with glass ionomer cement. Subjects and Methods: Fifty freshly extracted human premolars were subjected to standardized tooth preparation (20 ° total convergence, 4 mm axial height) with a computer numerically controlled machine. Individual cast <b>metal</b> <b>crowns</b> were fabricated from a base metal alloy. Dentin desensitizers included none (control), a glutaraldehyde (GLU) based primer (Gluma desensitizer), casein phosphopeptide (CPP) -amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) (GC Mousse), erbium, chromium: YSGG laser (Waterlase MD Turbo, Biolase) and Pro-Argin (Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief desensitizing polishing paste). After desensitization, crowns were luted with glass ionomer cement and kept for 48 h at 37 °C in 100 % relative humidity. The samples were tested using a universal testing machine by applying a load at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analysis included One-way ANOVA, followed by the Scheffe post-hoc test with P < 0. 05. Results: All dentin desensitizers showed significantly different values: Pro-Argin (4. 10 Megapascals [Mpa]) < CPP-ACP (4. 01 mpa) < GLU based primer (3. 87 Mpa) < Virgin dentin (3. 65 Mpa) < LASER (3. 37 Mpa).
