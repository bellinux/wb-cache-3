500|$|During {{his first}} year at the Liverpool College of Art, Sutcliffe worked as a bin man on the Liverpool Corporation's waste {{collection}} trucks. Lennon was introduced to Sutcliffe by Bill Harry, a mutual friend, when all three were studying at the Liverpool College of Art. According to Lennon, Sutcliffe had a [...] "marvellous art portfolio" [...] and was a very talented painter {{who was one of the}} [...] "stars" [...] of the school. He helped Lennon to improve his artistic skills, and with others, worked with him when Lennon had to submit work for exams. Sutcliffe shared a flat with Murray at 9 Percy Street, Liverpool, before being evicted and moving to Hillary Mansions at 3 Gambier Terrace, where another art student lived, Margaret Chapman, who competed with Sutcliffe to be the best painter in class. The flat was opposite the new Anglican cathedral in the rundown area of Liverpool 8, with bare lightbulbs and a <b>mattress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> in the corner. Lennon moved in with Sutcliffe in early 1960. (Paul McCartney later admitted that he was jealous of Sutcliffe's relationship with Lennon, as he had to take a [...] "back seat" [...] to Sutcliffe). Sutcliffe and his flatmates painted the rooms yellow and black, which their landlady did not appreciate. On another occasion the tenants, needing to keep warm, burned the flat's furniture.|$|E

2500|$|... 11-year-old Charlie Bucket {{lives in}} poverty {{in a tiny}} house with his parents and four {{grandparents}}. His grandparents share the only bed in the house, located in the only bedroom. Charlie and his parents sleep on a <b>mattress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> One day, Grandpa Joe tells him about the legendary and eccentric chocolatier, Willy Wonka and all the wonderful candy he made until the other candymakers sent in spies to steal his secret recipes, which led him to close the factory forever. The next day, the newspaper announces that Mr Wonka is reopening the factory and has invited five children to come on a tour, after they find a golden ticket in a Wonka Bar. Each ticket find is a media sensation and each finder becomes a celebrity. The first four golden tickets are found by the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled and petulant Veruca Salt, the gum-addicted Violet Beauregarde, and the TV-obsessed Mike Teavee.|$|E
50|$|Even tighter {{control was}} imposed when {{regulation}} of common lodging houses was {{transferred from the}} police to the London County Council in 1894, resulting in the imposition of higher standards and regular inspection of the premises by council officials. The new regulations required the landlords to limewash the walls and ceilings twice a year and the mixed sex accommodation, which was frequently a cover for a brothel, was abolished. Proper beds and bedding had also to be provided instead of <b>mattresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and worse.|$|R

50|$|Women {{prisoners in}} Western Australia were housed at Fremantle Gaol until a Women’s Rehabilitation Centre was opened in 1969. Bandyup Training Centre, the {{precursor}} to Bandyup Women’s Prison, was opened in 1971. It was originally built to hold 68 women. In 1998, following civil society agitation, an urgency motion and debate {{was held in}} state parliament about the conditions at Bandyup. The prison was so overcrowded that women were sleeping <b>on</b> <b>mattresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> A major refurbishment of the prison {{with the addition of}} new units, completed in 2003, brought the total design capacity to 180. Not long after, however, overcrowding again became an issue and continues to this day.|$|R
50|$|Women {{are still}} {{sleeping}} <b>on</b> <b>mattresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> in 2015. Despite the Minister for Corrective Services assuring {{this was not}} the case in Parliament <b>on</b> 19 February, <b>the</b> prison will continue this practice while there is no cap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> number of women that can be held there.In early 2015, the Department of Corrective Services stopped using the phrase ‘operational capacity’ and starting using the phrase ‘total capacity’, which includes beds that have been added to <b>the</b> design capacity <b>on</b> an ad hoc basis. The total capacity published <b>on</b> <b>the</b> DCS website <b>on</b> 23 January 2015 was 321, though the total population at Bandyup on any one day is consistently higher than this.Bunk beds have been installed in various units and are planned to be installed in most cells of the prison, including cells designed for single occupancy. The beds added in unit 4 are so close to the ceiling that the occupant is not able to sit upright in bed and a ceiling light is about 10 cm away from the head of the bed. As there is no desk or chair in these units, these occupants are not able to sit down in the cell. The increase in beds comes without a corresponding increase in other infrastructure, such as showering facilities, or services, such as nursing services or access to phones. While waiting for bunk beds, women have been sleeping <b>on</b> plastic-covered <b>mattresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> In units 1 and 2, women that sleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> have their head next to the toilet. These units are mostly occupied by Aboriginal women.|$|R

60|$|A {{flash of}} {{lightning}} startled the gentlemen {{when they went to}} the window to look out: the thunderstorm began. It was simply impossible that two strangers to the neighborhood could find their way to the station, through storm and darkness, in time to catch the train. With or without bedrooms, they must remain at the inn for the night. Having already given up their own room to their lodgers, the landlord and landlady had no other place to sleep in than the kitchen. Next to the kitchen, and communicating with it by a door, was an outhouse; used, partly as a scullery, partly as a lumber-room. There was an old truckle-bed among the lumber, on which one of the gentlemen might rest. A <b>mattress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> could be provided for the other.

He avoided the reflection in the opposite windows of the light that burned above, {{as though it had}} been an angry eye. He often, in every night, rose up from his fitful sleep, and looked and longed for dawn; all directions and arrangements, even to the ordering of their daily meals, he abandoned to Mr Pecksniff. That excellent gentleman, deeming that the mourner wanted comfort, and that high feeding was likely to do him infinite service, availed himself of these opportunities to such good purpose, that they kept quite a dainty table during this melancholy season; with sweetbreads, stewed kidneys, oysters, and other such light viands for supper every night; over which, and sundry jorums of hot punch, Mr Pecksniff delivered such moral reflections and spiritual consolation as might have converted a Heathen--especially if he had had but an imperfect acquaintance with the English tongue.|$|E

They were short-handed in the matter of physicians and nurses; and Henry and such others as were considered to be fatally hurt were receiving only such attention as could be spared, from time to time, from the more urgent cases. But Dr. Peyton, a fine and large-hearted old physician of great reputation in the community, gave me his sympathy and took vigorous hold of the case, and in about a week he had brought Henry around. Dr. Peyton never committed himself with prognostications which might not materialize, but at eleven o'clock one night he told me that Henry was out of danger, and would get well. Then he said, [...] "At midnight these poor fellows lying here and there all over this place will begin to mourn and mutter and lament and make outcries, and if this commotion should disturb Henry it will be bad for him; therefore ask the physician on watch to give him an eighth of a grain of morphine, but this is not to be done unless Henry shall show signs that he is being disturbed." ...|$|E

In 1974, Princess Aida was seized at the palace at Mekele by revolutionary soldiers sent to arrest her husband. Ras Mangasha had escaped days earlier and would establish the Ethiopian Democratic Union (EDU) which would fight the Derg regime until the EDU fractured in 1977 between rival factions. Princess Aida however had decided to remain behind and share the fate of her grandfather, her mother, and her family. Princess Aida was among the women of the Imperial family who were incarcerated under the Derg for 14 years. Her brother Prince Rear Admiral Iskinder Desta was executed along with 62 other former officials on Friday November 23, 1974. Together with her mother Princess Tenagnework Haile Selassie, and her sisters Princesses Seble, Sophia and Hirut, were Princess Sara Gizaw, Duchess of Harar (Widow of Prince Makonnen Haile Selasssie), Princess Yeshashework Yilma (the Emperor's niece by his elder brother), Princess Ijigayehu Asfaw Wossen (daughter of the Crown Prince) and Princess Zuriashwork Gebre-Igziabiher (widow of Prince Asrate Kassa). These women were made to share a former storage room in the precincts of the notorious Akaki Prison known as [...] "Alem Bekagn" [...] which translates to [...] "I am done with the world". They shared <b>mattresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and were forced to endure the light of a single light bulb that was never turned off during their entire imprisonment. Years of campaigning by their friends and relatives as well as human rights and humanitarian organizations around the world had little effect in convincing the Derg regime to release the women of the Imperial family. The Princesses were suddenly and unexpectedly released from prison in September 1988, followed a year later by the men of the family.|$|R
