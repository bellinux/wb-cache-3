2500|$|While it {{had been}} {{necessary}} to obtain an Act of Parliament {{to build a new}} railway, the government initially took a laissez faire approach to their construction and operation. The Government began to take an interest in safety matters, with the 1840 [...] "Act for Regulating Railways", which empowered the Board of Trade to appoint railway inspectors. The Railway Inspectorate was established in 1840 to enquire after the causes of accidents and recommend ways of avoiding them. The first investigation was conducted by Colonel Frederic Smith into 5 deaths caused by a large casting falling from a moving train in 1840 (Howden rail crash). He also conducted an enquiry into the derailment on the GWR when a <b>mixed</b> <b>goods</b> and passenger train derailed on Christmas Eve, 1841. The train hit a landslide at Sonning (Railway accident at Sonning Cutting), killing 9 passengers. [...] As early as 1844 a bill had been put before Parliament suggesting the state purchase of the railways; this was not adopted. It did, however, lead to the introduction to minimum standards for the construction of third-class carriages, an issue raised by the Sonning accident, which {{came to be known as}} [...] "Parliamentary Carriages".|$|E
2500|$|From 1866 a <b>mixed</b> <b>goods</b> and {{passenger}} service left Perth at 1am, after connecting with the 10am train from London, and arrived in Inverness at 9am. A night train {{service in the}} return direction started in 1872, leaving Inverness at 7:30pm to arrive in Perth at 5:05am. After sleeping carriages were made available from 1878, the train was re-timed to depart at 10pm and to arrive at 7am; London could be reached at 9:40pm. By 1883, there were four services each way between Inverness and Perth, taking between [...] and 7 hours; two years later the mail trains were rescheduled to take 4 hours with five stops. The loadings on these trains were light in winter, but heavy in July and August with through carriages from other railways being attached. In Express Trains English and Foreign Foxwell reports a doubled headed train with 37 carriages, including 12 horseboxes, from ten railway companies. This train was banked from Blair Atholl. The only train to run on Sundays was the mail train, except between 1878 and 1891 when the Inverness to Perth night train ran Sunday nights.|$|E

Contrary {{to the existing}} literature, this happens only when consumer types are observable.

6000|$|Before the {{beginning}} of this story of the most remarkable episodes in his life, Philip Hadden was engaged for several years in transport-riding--that is, in carrying goods on ox waggons from Durban or Maritzburg to various points in the interior. A difficulty such as had more than once confronted him {{in the course of his}} career, led to his temporary abandonment of this means of earning a livelihood. On arriving at the little frontier town of Utrecht in the Transvaal, in charge of two waggon loads of <b>mixed</b> <b>goods</b> consigned to a storekeeper there, it was discovered that out of six cases of brandy five were missing from his waggon. Hadden explained the matter by throwing the blame upon his Kaffir [...] "boys," [...] but the storekeeper, a rough-tongued man, openly called him a thief and refused to pay the freight on any of the load. From words the two men came to blows, knives were drawn, and before anybody could interfere the storekeeper received a nasty wound in his side. That night, without waiting till the matter could be inquired into by the landdrost or magistrate, Hadden slipped away, and trekked back into Natal as quickly as his oxen would travel. Feeling that even here he was not safe, he left one of his waggons at Newcastle, loaded up the other with Kaffir goods--such as blankets, calico, and hardware--and crossed into Zululand, where in those days no sheriff's officer would be likely to follow him.|$|E

Among the casualties were artisans returning home after working on the new Parliament building. The tragedy stimulated William Ewart Gladstone, while President of the Board of Trade (1843-1845), to introduce legislation to improve safety on the railways.|$|E
