Consumers value the bundling of pay TV channels with retransmitted free-to-air channels {{for a variety of}} reasons, in particular the improved signal quality provided in areas where off-air reception is less than ideal. Hence, the conditions under which pay TV services can retransmit free-to-air signals are of crucial importance. This paper compares US and Australian signal retransmission regulations and assesses their impact on competition between pay TV and free-to-air television and on actual or potential competition between pay TV media such as cable and satellite television. The analysis also touches on the competitive implications of common ownership of satellite and cable pay TV services. To place the signal retransmission issues in the proper context, the paper examines differences in the structure of free-to-air television distribution systems in Australia and the US. In particular, it contrasts the Australian tendency to distribute most programming and sell most advertising nationally with the more locally oriented network—affiliate system in the US. The paper considers the relative merits of compulsory licensing and full copyright protection for free-to-air television signals and examines <b>mandatory</b> <b>signal</b> carriage ('must-carry') regulations. competition, copyright, free-to-air TV, pay TV, retransmission,...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe related Wnt-Frizzled(Fz) /β-catenin and Fz/planar cell {{polarity}} (PCP) pathways {{are essential}} for the regulation of numerous developmental processes and are deregulated in many human diseases. Both pathways require members of the Dishevelled (Dsh or Dvl) family of cytoplasmic factors for signal transduction downstream of the Fz receptors. Dsh family members have been studied extensively, but their activation and regulation remains largely unknown. In particular, very {{little is known about}} how Dsh differentially signals to the two pathways. Recent work in cell culture has suggested that phosphorylation of Dsh by Casein Kinase I epsilon (CKIɛ) may act as a molecular “switch,” promoting Wnt/β-catenin while inhibiting Fz/PCP signaling [1]. Here, we demonstrate in vivo in Drosophila through a series of loss-of-function and coexpression assays that CKIɛ acts positively for signaling in both pathways, rather than as a switch. Our data suggest that the kinase activity of CKIɛ is required for peak levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In contrast, CKIɛ is a <b>mandatory</b> <b>signaling</b> factor in the Fz/PCP pathway, possibly through a kinase-independent mechanism. Furthermore, we have identified the primary kinase target residue of CKIɛ on Dsh. Thus, our data suggest that CKIɛ modulates Wnt/β-catenin and Fz/PCP signaling pathways via kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms...|$|R

On-line SPE was evaluated with one restricted access material (RAM), two large particle supports (LPS) and one monolith. A sample protein precipitation (PP) with acetonitrile (2 : 1) and a direct injection were tested. Principal component analysis (PCA) {{was performed to}} simplify data presentation and interpretation. Protein precipitation {{was found to be}} <b>mandatory</b> for reducing <b>signal</b> modification. Regarding sensitivity towards matrix effects after PP, atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) was globally the least sensitive ionization mode while electrospray ionization ESI was the most sensitive...|$|R
40|$|Although genetic {{engineering}} is a prom 1 Smg tool for crop varietal development, genetically modified foods {{continue to be}} controversial. Many groups that oppose these new goods are supporting a public policy of mandatory labelling for GM content. Debate, however, contirmes over whether the USA should impose a mandatory labelling policy for genetically modified (GM) foods. Groups that favour a mandatory labelling policy for GM foods include Greenpeace International (1997) Friends of the Earth (2001), and the Consumers Union (Consumer Reports, 1999). Groups opposing mandatory GM labels include the Council for Biotechnology Information (2001) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (2001). This contentious issue has engaged debate from {{all sides of the}} spectrum, yet only modest economic research has examined the merits and pitfalls of a new regulation that requires mandatory labelling for GM foods in the USA. This chapter examines the potential welfare effects of imposing a mandatory GMlabelling policy in the USA. We first discuss when a mandatory labelling policy is likely to benefit consumers. We then describe an experimental auction designed to provide data that are needed to test whether consumers will benefit from a mandatory GM-labelling policy. For a sample of adult consumers living in two major Midwestern cities, our results do not contradict the hypothesis that consumers interpret voluntary and <b>mandatory</b> market <b>signals</b> identically. These findings suggest that it would be more e fficient or welfare improving for the USA to continue its voluntary labelling policy and resist calls for new regulations that mandate labelling of GM foods...|$|R

When information {{is presented in two}} forms, children may derive an estimate from the fastest available source, subsequently ignoring the alternate, even if it contains redundant information. Nardini et al. (2010) provides evidence that children's (aged 6 years) response latencies are significantly lower when stimuli are presented in multi-cue over single-cue conditions. Conversely, adults showed no change between these conditions. Indeed, adults display <b>mandatory</b> fusion of <b>signals,</b> therefore they can only ever aim for maximum accuracy. Interestingly, however, the overall mean latencies for children were not faster than adults, which suggests that speed optimization merely enable them {{to keep up with the}} mature pace. Considering the haste of real-world events, this strategy may prove necessary to counteract the general slower processing of children and maintain effective vision-action coupling. Ultimately the developing sensory system may preferentially adapt for different goals – speed and detecting sensory conflicts – those typical of objective learning.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{activation}} details and products of human lymphomonocytes, stimulated by different Î²-glucans, that is Euglena paramylon, MacroGardÂ®, and lipopolysaccharide. We investigated the gene expression of inflammation-related cytokines and mediators, transactivation of relevant transcription factors, and phagocytosis role in cell-glucan interactions, by means of RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and colorimetric assay. Our results show that sonicated and alkalized paramylon upregulates pro-inflammatory factors (NO, TNF-Î±, IL- 6, and COX- 2) in lymphomonocytes. A clear demonstration of this upregulation is the increased transactivation of NF-kB visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. Phagocytosis assay showed that internalization is not a <b>mandatory</b> step for <b>signaling</b> cascade to be triggered, since immune activity is not present in the lymphomonocytes that have internalized paramylon granules and particulate MacroGardÂ®. Moreover, the response of Euglena Î²-glucan-activated lymphomonocytes is much greater than that induced by commercially used Î²-glucans such as MacroGardÂ®. Our in vitro results indicate that linear fibrous Euglena Î²-glucan, obtained by sonication and alkaline treatment can act as safe and effective coadjutant of the innate immune system response...|$|R

40|$|Chemokines {{regulate}} leukocyte migration during {{physiological and}} pathological conditions. They exert their biological activity through interaction with 7 -transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and are presented on glycosaminoglycans (GAG) linked to endothelial cell layers. Specific chemokines and chemokine receptors affect angiogenesis or are targets for viral mimicry, e. g. by {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). Several enzymes, in particular proteases, have been described to process chemokines at specific sites generating chemokine isoforms that were also identified from natural sources. For some chemokines, e. g. CXCL 8 and CCL 3 L 1, posttranslational modification results in enhanced biological activity. For CXCL 7 and CCL 14 truncation is even <b>mandatory</b> for receptor <b>signaling</b> and chemotactic properties. The activity of many other chemokines is down-regulated by processing and receptor antagonists are generated, e. g. for truncated CCL 8 and CCL 11. Moreover, some processed chemokines such as CCL 5 (3 - 68) show enhanced affinity for one receptor (CCR 5) and reduced interaction with other receptors (CCR 1 and CCR 3) resulting in differential changes in leukocyte response. These posttranslational mechanisms, in addition to gene duplication, transcriptional and translational regulation of chemokine ligand and receptor expression, GAG binding properties, expression of "silent" receptors and synergistic interaction between chemokines, modulate chemokine activity in a complex manner. This report reviews current understanding on the regulation of the chemokine network through posttranslational modification and its consequences for leukocyte migration, angiogenesis and protection against viral infection. status: publishe...|$|R
