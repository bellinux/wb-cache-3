25|$|The {{antihypertensive}} {{effects of}} <b>methyldopa,</b> mecamylamine, reserpine and veratrum alkaloids {{may be reduced}} by sympathomimetics. Beta-adrenergic antagonists may also interact with sympathomimetics. Increase of ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. Antacids increase the rate of pseudoephedrine absorption, while kaolin decreases it.|$|E
25|$|Autoimmune {{hepatitis}} is {{a chronic}} disease {{caused by an}} abnormal immune response against liver cells. The disease {{is thought to have}} a genetic predisposition as it is associated with certain human leukocyte antigens involved in the immune response. As in other autoimmune diseases, circulating auto-antibodies may be present and are helpful in diagnosis. Auto-antibodies found in patients with autoimmune hepatitis include the sensitive but less specific anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA), and atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA). Other autoantibodies that are less common but more specific to autoimmune hepatitis are the antibodies against liver kidney microsome 1 (LKM1) and soluble liver antigen (SLA). Autoimmune hepatitis can also be triggered by drugs (such as nitrofurantoin, hydralazine, and <b>methyldopa),</b> after liver transplant, or by viruses (such as hepatitis A, Epstein-Barr virus, or measles).|$|E

50|$|Non-heme iron {{forms an}} {{insoluble}} complex {{with several other}} drugs, resulting in decreased absorption of both iron and the other drug. Examples include tetracycline, penicillamine, <b>methyldopa,</b> levodopa, bisphosphonates and quinolones. The same can occur with elements in food, such as calcium. Absorption of iron is better at a low pH (i.e. an acidic environment), and absorption is decreased {{if there is a}} simultaneous intake of antacids.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{substances}} {{interfere with the}} Ehrlich reaction on the Multistix strip: porphobilinogen, indican, p-amino salicylic acid, sulphonamide, <b>methyldopa,</b> procaine and chlorpromazine. The test should be carried out at room temperature as the reaction’s sensitivity increases with temperature. Poorly stored samples can yield false negative results as the urobilinogen suffers photo oxidation to urobilin that does not react. The formaldehyde used as a preservative produces false negatives in both reactions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methyldopa,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Aldomet among others, is a {{medication}} used for high blood pressure. It {{is one of the}} preferred treatments for high blood pressure in pregnancy. For other types of high blood pressure including very high blood pressure resulting in symptoms other medications are typically preferred. It can be given by mouth or injection into a vein. Onset of effects is around 5 hours and they last about a day.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} can {{be established}} by measuring catecholamines and metanephrines in plasma (blood) or through a 24-hour urine collection. Care {{should be taken to}} rule out other causes of adrenergic (adrenalin-like) excess like hypoglycemia, stress, exercise, and drugs affecting the catecholamines like stimulants, <b>methyldopa,</b> dopamine agonists, or ganglion blocking antihypertensives. Various foodstuffs (e.g. coffee, tea, bananas, chocolate, cocoa, citrus fruits, and vanilla) can also affect the levels of urinary metanephrine and VMA (vanillylmandelic acid).|$|E
5000|$|Common {{causes of}} drug-related {{cheilitis}} include Etretinate, Indinavir, Protease inhibitors, Vitamin A and Isotretinoin (a retinoid drug). Uncommon causes include Atorvastatin, Busulphan, Clofazimine, Clomipramine, Cyancobalamin, Gold, <b>Methyldopa,</b> Psoralens, Streptomycin, Sulfasalazine and Tetracycline. A condition called [...] "drug-induced ulcer of the lip" [...] {{is described as}} being characterized by painful or tender, well-defined ulcerations of the lip without induration. It {{is the result of}} oral administration of drugs, and the condition resolves when the drugs are stopped.|$|E
50|$|Lactation {{requires}} {{the presence of}} prolactin, and the evaluation of galactorrhea includes eliciting a history for various medications or foods (<b>methyldopa,</b> opioids, antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as well as licorice) and for behavioral causes (stress, and breast and chest wall stimulation), as well as evaluation for pregnancy, pituitary adenomas (with overproduction of prolactin or compression of the pituitary stalk), and hypothyroidism. Adenomas of the anterior pituitary are most often prolactinomas. Overproduction of prolactin leads to cessation of menstrual periods and infertility, which may be a diagnostic clue. Galactorrhea may also be caused by hormonal imbalances owing to birth control pills.|$|E
50|$|When <b>methyldopa</b> {{was first}} introduced, {{it was the}} {{mainstay}} of antihypertensive treatment, but its use has declined on account of relatively severe adverse side effects, with increased use of other safer and more tolerable agents such as alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Additionally, {{it has yet to}} be associated with reducing adverse cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction and stroke, or overall all-cause mortality reduction in clinical trials. Nonetheless, one of methyldopa's still current indications is in the management of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), as it is relatively safe in pregnancy compared to many other antihypertensives which may affect the fetus.|$|E
50|$|While {{increase}} of dopamine levels is a desired interaction, tolcapone can theoretically {{also increase the}} levels of other drugs metabolised by COMT, such as the AADC inhibitors carbidopa and benzerazide, as well as <b>methyldopa,</b> dobutamine, apomorphine, adrenaline, and isoprenaline. In studies, a slight interaction with benzerazide was seen, but not with carbidopa. Other interactions with this group of drugs have not been studied. A related type of theoretical interactions is with drugs that increase catecholamine concentrations, such as monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors; these also showed only slight effects in practice. Combination with non-selective MAO inhibitors might be dangerous.|$|E
50|$|Noncyclical breast pain has various {{causes and}} {{is harder to}} diagnose. Noncyclical pain has {{frequently}} its root cause outside the breast. Some degree of non-cyclical breast tenderness can normally be present due to hormonal changes in puberty (both in girls and boys), in menopause and during pregnancy. After pregnancy, breast pain {{can be caused by}} breastfeeding. Other causes of non-cyclical breast pain include alcoholism with liver damage (likely due to abnormal steroid metabolism), mastitis and medications such as digitalis, <b>methyldopa</b> (an antihypertensive), spironolactone, certain diuretics, oxymetholone (an anabolic steroid), and chlorpromazine (a typical antipsychotic). Also, shingles can cause a painful blistering rash on the skin of the breasts.|$|E
50|$|Recommendations for {{prevention}} include: aspirin {{in those at}} high risk, calcium supplementation in areas with low intake, and treatment of prior hypertension with medications. In those with pre-eclampsia delivery of the baby and placenta is an effective treatment. When delivery becomes recommended depends on how severe the pre-eclampsia and how far along in pregnancy a person is. Blood pressure medication, such as labetalol and <b>methyldopa,</b> {{may be used to}} improve the mother's condition before delivery. Magnesium sulfate may be used to prevent eclampsia in those with severe disease. Bedrest and salt intake have not been found to be useful for either treatment or prevention.|$|E
50|$|In studies, {{entacapone}} {{has shown}} a low potential for interaction with other drugs. In theory, it could interact with MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors because they also increase catecholamine levels in the body, with drugs being metabolized by COMT (for example <b>methyldopa,</b> dobutamine, apomorphine, adrenaline, and isoprenaline), with iron because it could form chelates, with substances binding to the same albumin site in the blood plasma (for example diazepam and ibuprofen), and with drugs being metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP2C9 (for example warfarin). None of the medications tested in studies have shown clinically relevant interactions, except perhaps warfarin for which a 13% (CI90: 6-19%) increase in INR was seen when combined with entacapone.|$|E
50|$|Examples {{of drugs}} {{commonly}} associated with depressogenic effects include some anticonvulsants such as the barbiturates (e.g. phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam), vigabatrin, and topiramate, corticosteroids like dexamethasone and prednisone, cytokines like interferon-α and interleukin-2, certain antihypertensives such as amiodarone, clonidine, <b>methyldopa,</b> reserpine, and tetrabenazine (used as an antipsychotic/antihyperkinetic), and agents with antiandrogen, antiestrogen, and/or anti-neurosteroid activities such as GnRH agonists (e.g., leuprolide, goserelin), anastrozole (an aromatase inhibitor), finasteride (a 5α-reductase inhibitor), and clomiphene (a SERM), {{as well as others}} including flunarizine, mefloquine, and efavirenz. Another notable agent is rimonabant, a cannabinoid receptor antagonist marketed as an anti-obesity agent which was withdrawn shortly after its introduction due to the incidence of severe psychiatric side effects associated with its use including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.|$|E

50|$|The {{concentration}} of 5’nucleotidase protein {{in the blood}} is often used as a liver function test in individuals that show signs of liver problems. The combined assays of serum 5'nucleotisase and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activities are extremely helpful in differential diagnosis since serum 5'nucleotidase activity is increased in obstructive hepatobiliary disorders, but not in osseous disorders, whereas serum AP activity is generally increased in both categories of diseases. In other words, the test is used to determine if elevated protein levels are due to skeletal damage or liver damage. Normal levels of 5’nucleotidase are 2-17 units per liter. Elevated levels may indicate cholestasis, destruction of liver cells, hepatitis (liver inflammation), liver ischemia, a liver tumor, or use of liver-damaging drugs. Pregnancy and certain medications (acetaminophen, halothane, isoniazid, <b>methyldopa,</b> nitrofurantoin) may interfere with the test.|$|E
30|$|Also, {{in order}} to {{evaluate}} the analytical applicability of the proposed method, it was applied for the determination of <b>methyldopa</b> in urine samples. Known amounts of <b>methyldopa</b> {{were added to the}} urine sample, and its concentrations were estimated with the proposed method. The urine sample was found to be free from <b>methyldopa.</b> Therefore, different amounts of <b>methyldopa</b> were spiked to the sample and analyzed by the proposed method. The results for determination of <b>methyldopa</b> in real samples are given in Table  2. Satisfactory recovery of the experimental results was found for <b>methyldopa.</b> The reproducibility of the method was demonstrated by the mean R.S.D.|$|E
