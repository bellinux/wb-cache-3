40|$|Thickness {{determination}} of ZnO transparent material on a substrate (<b>microscope</b> <b>slide)</b> by using Michelson Interferometer {{has been carried}} out. Materials which used in the research were a <b>microscope</b> <b>slide,</b> which thickness of 1 mm, and ZnO transparent material on a 1 mm <b>microscope</b> <b>slide.</b> Refractive index of the <b>microscope</b> <b>slide</b> and the thickness of ZnO were measured by counting the fringes transitions as the materials rotated large as f, on the other words, fringes transitions N as function of sinus incident angles f of laser ray, N º N(sinf). Incident angles of laser ray, which {{are used in the}} measurement of refractive index of <b>microscope</b> <b>slide</b> and of ZnO transparent material thickness on <b>microscope</b> <b>slide,</b> are 1 °, 2 °, 3 °, 4 °, 5 °, 6 °, 7 °, 8 °, 9 °, dan 10 °. Laser ray used in this research was He-Ne laser, which has l = 633 nm and its output power was < 1 mW. The results of this research show that there were N fringes transitions as research-materials rotated large as f. Those measured fringes transitions still have remarkable agreement with the theoretical fringes transitions, by which has to be compared. As the incident angles get bigger, the fringes transitions N get bigger too. The thickness of the ZnO thin film, which was resulted from the research, was (6. 0 ± 1. 8) × 10 - 5 m...|$|R
25|$|FISH is {{the most}} {{commonly}} applied method to determine the chromosomal constitution of an embryo. In contrast to karyotyping, {{it can be used}} on interphase chromosomes, {{so that it can be}} used on PBs, blastomeres and TE samples. The cells are fixated on glass <b>microscope</b> <b>slides</b> and hybridised with DNA probes. Each of these probes are specific for part of a chromosome, and are labelled with a fluorochrome.|$|E
25|$|Organic palynofacies {{considers}} all {{the acid}} insoluble {{particulate organic matter}} (POM), including kerogen and palynomorphs in sediments and palynological preparations of sedimentary rocks. The sieved or unsieved preparations may be examined using strew mounts on <b>microscope</b> <b>slides</b> that may be examined using a transmitted light biological microscope or ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence microscope. The abundance, composition and preservation of the various components, together with the thermal alteration of the organic matter is considered.|$|E
25|$|In {{organisms that}} {{maintain}} a constant shape and have one dimension {{longer than the}} other, at least two directional terms can be used. The long or longitudinal axis is defined by points at the {{opposite ends of the}} organism. Similarly, a perpendicular transverse axis can be defined by points {{on opposite sides of the}} organism. There is typically no basis for the definition of a third axis. Usually such organisms are planktonic (free-swimming) protists, and are nearly always viewed on <b>microscope</b> <b>slides,</b> where they appear essentially two-dimensional. In some cases a third axis can be defined, particularly where a non-terminal cytostome or other unique structure is present.|$|E

25|$|Indirect {{immunofluorescence}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used tests for ANAs. Typically, HEp-2 cells are used as a substrate to detect the antibodies in human serum. <b>Microscope</b> <b>slides</b> are coated with HEp-2 cells and the serum is incubated with the cells. If antibodies are present then they will bind to the antigens on the cells; in the case of ANAs, the antibodies will bind to the nucleus. These can be visualised by adding a fluorescent tagged (usually FITC or rhodopsin B) anti-human antibody that binds to the antibodies. The molecule will fluoresce when a specific wavelength of light shines on it, which can be seen under the microscope. Depending on the antibody present in the human serum and the localisation of the antigen in the cell, distinct patterns of fluorescence will be seen on the HEp-2 cells. Levels of antibodies are analysed by performing dilutions on blood serum. An ANA test is considered positive if fluorescence is seen at a titre of 1:40/1:80. Higher titres are more clinically significant as low positives (≤1:160) are found in up to 20% of healthy individuals, especially the elderly. Only around 5% of the healthy population have ANA titres of 1:160 or higher.|$|E

[...] Specialist glass tubing and <b>microscope</b> <b>slides</b> are produced by Chance Brothers in their factory in Malvern next door to the Morgan Motor works. Pipe organs have been built in Malvern since Nicholson Organs was founded by John Nicholson in 1841.
