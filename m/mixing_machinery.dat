50|$|A Syrian {{defector}} {{who worked}} inside the chemical weapons network alleged that in January 2012 two senior Syrian officers moved about 100 kg. {{of chemical weapons}} materials from a secret military base in Nasiriyah. The Syrian source also described construction of special trucks, which could transport and mix the weapons. These mobile mixers were constructed inside Mercedes or Volvo trucks that were similar to refrigerator trucks. Inside were storage tanks, pipes and a motor to drive the <b>mixing</b> <b>machinery,</b> the defector said.|$|E

As this provided a prominent target for then-new infrared homing missiles, only Sheffield and both the Argentinian Hércules and Santísima Trinidad had these 'ears'.

40|$|We {{introduce}} Generalized Multilevel Functional Linear Models (GMFLMs), a novel statistical {{framework for}} regression models where exposure has a multilevel functional structure. We show that GMFLMs are, in fact, generalized multilevel mixed models. Thus, GMFLMs {{can be analyzed}} using the <b>mixed</b> effects inferential <b>machinery</b> and can be generalized within a well-researched statistical framework. We propose and compare two methods for inference: (1) a two-stage frequentist approach; and (2) a joint Bayesian analysis. Our methods are motivated by and applied to the Sleep Heart Health Study, the largest community cohort study of sleep. However, our methods are general and easy to apply to {{a wide spectrum of}} emerging biological and medical datasets. Supplemental materials for this article are available online...|$|R
5000|$|In case {{of failure}} to achieve any gains by a strike, the worker resorts to sabotage, the silent strike by which are gained all the {{advantages}} of the open strike without its dangers; i.e., the men keep their places at their machines, thus preventing and making unnecessary the employment of scabs, pretending to do the work for which they receive their pay, but actually doing only so much of it as is needed to deceive the overseers. At the same time the worker employs many methods of attacking the employer, such as breaking delicate parts of <b>machinery,</b> <b>mixing</b> wrong ingredients into compounds, telling truth or lies to customers, anything, in short, to force the employer to terms.It is useless to assert that these methods will not appeal to AngloSaxon workers, as does one writer on the subject. Certainly sabotage is not [...] "fair-play," [...] but neither is {{in the eyes of the}} laborer, the condition which forces him to it.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} Generalized Multilevel Functional Linear Models (GMFLM), a novel statistical framework {{motivated by}} {{and applied to}} the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), the largest community cohort study of sleep. The primary goal of SHHS is to study the association between sleep disrupted breathing (SDB) and adverse health effects. An exposure of primary interest is the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG), which was observed for thousands of individuals at two visits, roughly 5 years apart. This unique study design {{led to the development}} of models where the outcome, e. g. hypertension, is in an exponential family and the exposure, e. g. sleep EEG, is multilevel functional data. We show that GMFLMs are, in fact, generalized multilevel mixed effect models. Two consequences of this result are that: 1) the <b>mixed</b> effects inferential <b>machinery</b> can be used for GMFLM and 2) functional regression models can be extended naturally to include, for example, additional covariates, random effects and nonparametric components. We propose and compare two inferential methods based on the parsimonious decomposition of the functional space...|$|R
40|$|Accelerated {{carbonation}} involves {{exposing a}} material to a concentrated atmosphere of carbon dioxide, {{and can be}} used to treat hazardous wastes and soils and create new construction materials. The present work examines the use of accelerated carbonation to reduce the hazardous properties of wastes as a means of reducing the costs of disposal to landfill, and then develops the process to manufacture aggregate from the waste removing it from landfill disposal completely. A range of thermal wastes, including those from cement, metallurgical and paper processes, were found to be reactive with carbon dioxide. Many of these wastes are hazardous on account of their alkaline pH, which carbonation partially neutralizes, effectively allowing reclassification of the materials as stable non-reactive hazardous wastes under the Landfill Regulations. Cement and paper wastes were highly reactive with carbon dioxide, and were considered for use as cement substitutes to reconstitute non-reactive wastes into aggregate. Previous work had suggested that carbonation and pelletising were not compatible due to differing optimum conditions. This issue was investigated by considering the effects of the <b>mix</b> formulations and <b>machinery</b> parameters. The pelletising and carbonation processes require widely different moisture contents. The disparity is due to the need for total saturation of the material to form bonds between grains during pelletising, and an open pore network for carbon dioxide to penetrate. To achieve the two simultaneously, several methods were investigated. Chemical catalysts including sodium hypochlorite and sodium sulfite increased carbonation in a saturated material. However, curing the formed aggregates in carbon dioxide was found to be the most economic solution. A pilot scale process was developed based upon the laboratory results. A bespoke rotary carbonation reactor was developed to produce aggregate in bulk for commercial testing. Aggregate which was subjected to accelerated carbonation, has enhanced strength and durability compared to aggregate exposed to natural carbonation. The aggregate was successfully used to produce lightweight concrete with comparable strength to concrete made from commercial lightweight aggregate. Aggregate was also supplied for a research project to investigate the use of recycled materials as a horticultural growing medium...|$|R
