40|$|Abstract. Lack of fusion {{is a very}} {{dangerous}} weld defect in a welded structure. Because of the notch effect, a crack may further propagate under the smallest load applied. This type of defect is very difficult to detect with non-destructive testing methods. For {{the purpose of the present}} study, lack-of-fusion defects were artificially produced in a multi-pass welded joint. The aim was to find out how ultrasonic devices can sense this type of defect in a butt weld. In addition radiography was used to detect the occurrence of lack of fusion in the welded joint. In the ultrasonic examination 60 ° and 70 ° angle probes were applied. They showed lack of fusion at the opposite side-walls of the groove. A normal probe was then used to detect the occurrence of inter-run lack of fusion. The weld defects provided a multiple reflection of ultrasonic waves, which confirmed the presence of lack of fusion in a certain depth. This was additionally confirmed by an ultrasonic thickness <b>measuring</b> <b>gage.</b> Finally, micro sections of the weld were made to establish the actual location and shape of lack-of-fusion defects. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} and modulus of amorphous diamond, a new material for surface micromachined MEMS and sensors, was tested in uniaxial tension by pulling laterally {{with a flat}} tipped diamond in a nanoindenter. Several sample designs were attempted. Of those, only the single layer specimen with a 1 by 2 {micro}m gage cross section and a fixed end rigidly attached to the substrate was successful. Tensile load was calculated by resolving the measured lateral and normal forces into the applied tensile force and frictional losses. Displacement was corrected for machine compliance using the differential stiffness method. Post-mortem examination of the samples was performed to document the failure mode. The load-displacement data from those samples that failed in the gage section was converted to stress-strain curves using carefully <b>measured</b> <b>gage</b> cross section dimensions.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{approach is}} discussed {{that may be}} used to directly include first and second order temperature effects in the load prediction algorithm of a wind tunnel strain-gage balance. The improved approach was designed for the Iterative Method that fits strain-gage outputs as a function of calibration loads and uses a load iteration scheme during the wind tunnel test to predict loads from <b>measured</b> <b>gage</b> outputs. The improved approach assumes that the strain-gage balance is at a constant uniform temperature when it is calibrated and used. First, the method introduces a new independent variable for the regression analysis of the balance calibration data. The new variable is designed as the difference between the uniform temperature of the balance and a global reference temperature. This reference temperature should be the primary calibration temperature of the balance so that, if needed, a tare load iteration can be performed. Then, two temperature{dependent terms are included in the regression models of the gage outputs. They are the temperature difference itself and the square of the temperature difference. Simulated temperature{dependent data obtained from Triumph Aerospace's 2013 calibration of NASA's ARC- 30 K five component semi{span balance is used to illustrate the application of the improved approach...|$|R
40|$|The iMachine is a {{spring-loaded}} turntable used {{to measure}} inertial properties of irregularly shaped rigid bodies, specifically manual wheelchairs. We used a Newton-Euler approach to calculate wheelchair mass and center of mass (CM) location from static force measurements using load cells. We determined the moment of inertia about the vertical axis from the natural frequency of the system in simple harmonic motion. The device was calibrated to eliminate the effects of platform components on measurement error. For objects with known inertial properties, the average relative error of the mass and the CM coordinates (x and y) were 0. 76 %, 0. 89 %, and 1. 99 %, respectively. The resolution of the moment of inertia calculation depends on the ratio of test piece inertia to system inertia, such that the higher the ratio, the more accurate the measurements. We conducted a Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility (Gage R&R) test using three manual wheelchairs measured three times by three operators; {{the results showed that}} over 90 % of the variance in inertia was caused by differences in the wheelchairs being <b>measured.</b> <b>Gage</b> R&R analysis indicated that measurement system operation was acceptable using criteria from the Automobile Industry Action Group for both inertia and mass measurements...|$|R

40|$|Calibration data of a {{wind tunnel}} sting balance was {{processed}} using a candidate math model search algorithm that recommends an optimized regression {{model for the}} data analysis. During the calibration the normal force and the moment at the balance moment center were selected as independent calibration variables. The sting balance itself had two moment gages. Therefore, after analyzing the connection between calibration loads and gage outputs, {{it was decided to}} choose the difference and the sum of the gage outputs as the two responses that best describe the behavior of the balance. The math model search algorithm was applied to these two responses. An optimized regression model was obtained for each response. Classical strain gage balance load transformations and the equations of the deflection of a cantilever beam under load are used to show that the search algorithm s two optimized regression models are supported by a theoretical analysis {{of the relationship between the}} applied calibration loads and the <b>measured</b> <b>gage</b> outputs. The analysis of the sting balance calibration data set is a rare example of a situation when terms of a regression model of a balance can directly be derived from first principles of physics.

40|$|Design, {{calibration}}, calibration analysis, {{and intended}} {{use of the}} MC- 130 air balance are discussed. The MC- 130 balance is an 8. 0 inch diameter force balance that has two separate internal air flow systems and one external bellows system. The manual calibration of the balance consisted {{of a total of}} 1854 data points with both unpressurized and pressurized air flowing through the balance. A subset of 1160 data points was chosen for the calibration data analysis. The regression analysis of the subset was performed using two fundamentally different analysis approaches. First, the data analysis was performed using a recently developed extension of the Iterative Method. This approach fits gage outputs as a function of both applied balance loads and bellows pressures while still allowing the application of the iteration scheme that is used with the Iterative Method. Then, for comparison, the axial force was also analyzed using the Non-Iterative Method. This alternate approach directly fits loads as a function of <b>measured</b> <b>gage</b> outputs and bellows pressures and does not require a load iteration. The regression models used by both the extended Iterative and Non-Iterative Method were constructed such that they met a set of widely accepted statistical quality requirements. These requirements lead to reliable regression models and prevent overfitting of data because they ensure that no hidden near-linear dependencies between regression model terms exist and that only statistically significant terms are included. Finally, a comparison of the axial force residuals was performed. Overall, axial force estimates obtained from both methods show excellent agreement as the differences of the standard deviation of the axial force residuals are on the order of 0. 001 % of the axial force capacity...|$|R

40|$|Flexible microwires {{fabricated}} from conducting polymers have a {{wide range}} of potential applications, including smart textiles that incorporate sensing, actuation, and data processing. The development of garments that integrate these functionalities over wide areas (i. e. the human body) requires the production of long, highly conductive, and mechanically robust fibers or microwires. This thesis describes the development of a microwire slicing instrument capable of producing conducting polymer wires with widths as small as a few micrometers and lengths ranging from tens of millimeters to meters. To ensure high conductivity and robustness, the wires are sliced from thin polypyrrole films electrodeposited onto a glassy carbon crucible. Extensive testing was conducted to determine the optimal cutting parameters for producing long, fine wires with cleanly cut edges. This versatile fabrication process has been used to produce free-standing microwires with cross-sections of 2 [micro]m x 3 [micro]m, 20 [micro]m x 20 [micro]m, and 100 [micro]m x 20 [micro]m with lengths of 15 mm, 460 mm, and 1, 200 mm, respectively. An electrochemical dynamic mechanical analyzer was used to measure the static and dynamic tensile properties, the strain-resistance relationship, and the electrochemical actuation performance of the microwires. The <b>measured</b> <b>gage</b> factors ranged from 0. 4 to 0. 7 and are suitable for strain sensing applications.

Four gages are mounted on a rigid beam that, in turn, is mounted {{on the side of}} a load vehicle. The gages read the distance to the pavement. Three of the gages are located outside the range of influence of the load wheel, and hence the pavement below these gages is undeflected. One of the gages is adjacent to the load wheel to measure the induced deflection. An algorithm is presented that relates all measurements to a common datum. ^ The three gages yield readings that are interpreted to give the profile (do the surveying). The gages make so many readings and so quickly, that the standard deviation of the readings, taken over a short time period, gives a measure of the texture. ^ A prototype device was constructed and tested. The results were: (1) Pavement profiles were calculated using the new system. These compare favorably, though not completely, with the transit surveys. (2) Standard deviations were recorded. These readings were taken over concrete, asphalt and porous friction surface pavements. Differences were noted between the textures of concrete (smooth) and asphalt (rough) pavements. No correlation between this measure and standard measures was made. (3) The deflections caused by prototype loads were measured and recorded.
