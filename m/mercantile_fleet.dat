25|$|The {{reason for}} the demise was not purely economic. Privateering {{represented}} a decentralization of power that was inconsistent with both technology {{and the evolution of}} the modern state.

It was this last that doomed privateering, according to Robinson, the primary modern historian of the Confederate privateers; his opinion is echoed by Luraghi. The effort of the Confederate government turned from privateers to their regularly commissioned raiders, which had spectacularly more success in attacking the northern <b>mercantile</b> <b>fleet.</b>|$|E
60|$|Coming in {{from the}} eastward, the bright {{colouring}} of the lightship marking {{the part of the}} river committed to the charge of an Admiral (the Commander-in-Chief at the Nore) accentuates the dreariness and the great breadth of the Thames Estuary. But soon the course of the ship opens the entrance of the Medway, with its men-of-war moored in line, and the long wooden jetty of Port Victoria, with its few low buildings like the beginning of a hasty settlement upon a wild and unexplored shore. The famous Thames barges sit in brown clusters upon the water with an effect of birds floating upon a pond. On the imposing expanse of the great estuary the traffic of the port where so much of the world's work and the world's thinking is being done becomes insignificant, scattered, streaming away in thin lines of ships stringing themselves out into the eastern quarter through the various navigable channels of which the Nore lightship marks the divergence. The coasting traffic inclines to the north; the deep-water ships steer east with a southern inclination, on through the Downs, to the most remote ends of the world. In the widening of the shores sinking low in the gray, smoky distances the greatness of the sea receives the <b>mercantile</b> <b>fleet</b> of good ships that London sends out upon the turn of every tide. They follow each other, going very close by the Essex shore. Such as the beads of a rosary told by business-like shipowners for the greater profit of the world they slip one by one into the open: while in the offing the inward-bound ships come up singly and in bunches from under the sea horizon closing the mouth of the river between Orfordness and North Foreland. They all converge upon the Nore, the warm speck of red upon the tones of drab and gray, with the distant shores running together towards the west, low and flat, like the sides of an enormous canal. The sea-reach of the Thames is straight, and, once Sheerness is left behind, its banks seem very uninhabited, except for the cluster of houses which is Southend, or here and there a lonely wooden jetty where petroleum ships discharge their dangerous cargoes, and the oil-storage tanks, low and round with slightly-domed roofs, peep {{over the edge of the}} fore-shore, as it were a village of Central African huts imitated in iron. Bordered by the black and shining mud-flats, the level marsh extends for miles. Away in the far background the land rises, closing the view with a continuous wooded slope, forming in the distance an interminable rampart overgrown with bushes.|$|E

25|$|By the 9th century, {{groups of}} Varangian Rus', {{developing}} a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways {{controlled by the}} Khazars and their protectorate, the Volga Bulgarians, partially {{in pursuit of the}} Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones, partially to trade in furs and ironwork. Northern <b>mercantile</b> <b>fleets</b> passing Atil were tithed, as they were at Byzantine Cherson. Their presence may have prompted the formation of a Rus' state by convincing the Slavs, Merja and the Chud' to unite to protect common interests against Khazarian exactions of tribute. It is often argued that a Rus' Khaganate modelled on the Khazarian state had formed to the east, and that the Varangian chieftain of the coalition appropriated the title of qaÄŸan (khagan) as early as the 830s: the title survived to denote the princes of Kievan Rus', whose capital, Kiev, is often associated with a Khazarian foundation. The construction of the Sarkel fortress, with technical assistance from Khazaria's Byzantine ally at the time, together with the minting of an autonomous Khazar coinage around the 830s may have been a defensive measure against emerging threats from Varangians to the north and from the Magyars on the eastern steppe. By 860, the Rus' had penetrated as far as Kiev and, via the Dnieper, Constantinople.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the close}} of the American war, Captain Ball was {{entrusted}} with the protection and convoying of an immense <b>mercantile</b> <b>fleet</b> to America, and by his great prudence and unexampled attention to the interests of all and each, endeared his name to the American merchants, and laid the foundation of that high respect and predilection which both the Americans and their government ever afterwards entertained for him. My recollection does not enable me to attempt any accuracy in the date or circumstances, or to add the particulars of his services in the West Indies and on the coast of America, I now therefore merely allude to the fact with a prospective reference to opinions and circumstances, which I shall have to mention hereafter. Shortly after the general peace was established, Captain Ball, who was now a married man, passed some time with his lady in France, and, if I mistake not, at Nantes. At the same time, and in the same town, among the other English visitors, Lord (then Captain) Nelson happened to be one. In consequence of some punctilio, as to whose business it was to pay the compliment of the first call, they never met, and this trifling affair occasioned a coldness between the two naval commanders, or in truth a mutual prejudice against each other. Some years after, both their ships being together close off Minorca and near Port Mahon, a violent storm nearly disabled Lord Nelson's vessel, and in addition to the fury of the wind, it was night time and the thickest darkness. Captain Ball, however, brought his vessel at length to Nelson's assistance, took his ship in tow, and used his best endeavours to bring her and his own vessel into Port Mahon. The difficulties and the dangers increased. Nelson considered the case of his own ship as desperate, and that unless she was immediately left to her own fate, both vessels would inevitably be lost. He, therefore, with the generosity natural to him, repeatedly requested Captain Ball to let him loose; and on Captain Ball's refusal, he became impetuous, and enforced his demand with passionate threats. Captain Ball then himself took the speaking-trumpet, which the fury of the wind and waves rendered necessary, and with great solemnity and without the least disturbance of temper, called out in reply, [...] "I feel confident that I can bring you in safe; I therefore must not, and, by the help of Almighty God, I will not leave you!" [...] What he promised he performed; and after they were safely anchored, Nelson came on board of Ball's ship, and embracing him with all the ardour of acknowledgment, exclaimed, [...] "A friend in need is a friend indeed!" [...] At this time and on this occasion commenced that firm and perfect friendship between these two great men, which was interrupted only by the death of the former. The pleasing task of dwelling on this mutual attachment I defer to that part of the present sketch which will relate to Sir Alexander Ball's opinions of men and things. It will be sufficient for the present to say, that the two men whom Lord Nelson especially honoured, were Sir Thomas Troubridge and Sir Alexander Ball; and once, when they were both present, on some allusion made to the loss of his arm, he replied, [...] "Who shall dare tell me that I want an arm, when I have three right arms--this (putting forward his own) and Ball and Troubridge?" ...|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to detect the strengths and the improvement requiring areas of sea transportation in Turkey via SWOT analysis, and the opportunities this sector brings to Turkey and the threats that might appear have been put forward in several aspects. When the necessary advances have been made considering the outcomes of this study, it can be foreseen that Turkish navigation can make a swift progress and assume {{its place in the}} top 5 <b>mercantile</b> <b>fleets</b> of the World Trade Fleet. Moreover, this new approach that can be developed through the example of Turkey, especially in the context of SWOT analysis methodology, can get {{to be seen as a}} role model before the other developing countries. Sea transportation is not merely a transportation sector. Along with goods and human transportation, ship building industry, port services, sea insurance and sea tourism are among the many naval activities. Because of all these, sea transportation has a significant place in international trade. The overall commercial value of world trade mounting up to 15 trillion US dollars, 9 trillion dollars of this has been conducted via sea transportation. In other words, 60 percent of world commerce has been done through sea transportation (GISBIR, 2013). Furthermore, the volume of the dry bulk market via sea transportation is expected to grow by 6 percent between the years 2014 and 2018 (GISBIR, 2013) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{attempts}} made during the second quarter of the nineteenth century to establish licensing examinations for ships' officers in the British mercantile marine. The focus is upon analysing the various forces which obtained to determine the pattern and progress of the examination debate. This involved a thorough sifting and evaluation of evidence in support of the view that the emergence of a national system of compulsory examinations for British shipmasters and mates was a more complex process than has been hitherto argued. It considers in detail the events between 1830 - 1850 when increasing demands were made upon government to attend to the problem of British shipwrecks, a problem which was shown {{to be related to the}} incompetence of ships' officers. The thesis shows that the demands to establish standards of professional competency for shipmasters were rooted in precedents of examinations in the Royal Navy, the East India Company, foreign <b>mercantile</b> <b>fleets,</b> professional occupations ashore and in the universities. It analyses the constraints on government action such as the widespread dislike of state interference in private affairs, the intransigent opposition of many shipping interests, the chaotic and restrictive nature of shipping legislation and the lack of a clearly defined government agency competent to supervise effectively a system of shipmaster examinations. The study demonstrates that the emergence of compulsory examinations for masters and mates coincided with the establishment of the Board of Trade as the executive department of government responsible for shipping affairs. Consequently, the Board's activities on the examination front are delineated and analysed. Also charted is the rise and fall of the General Shipowners' Society, the core of opposition to examination reform. Additionally, shipmaster examination reform is related to contemporary developments in the field of professional examinations...|$|R
50|$|Although in late 1939 many of Churchillâ€™s cabinet colleagues {{agreed with}} the need to take action to disrupt the iron ore traffic, they decided against the use of mines. At the time {{negotiations}} into the British chartering of the entire Norwegian <b>mercantile</b> shipping <b>fleet</b> were at a delicate stage and the British Foreign Office made convincing arguments against breaking Norwayâ€™s neutrality. In 1915 (during WWI) Britain had been forced to apologise to Norway for the violation of her territorial waters by British warships following the seizure of a German steamer inside the three mile limit. Near the end of World War I the British, Americans and French had induced the Norwegians to allow the Skjaergaard to be mined in order to prevent German ships and submarines from using their territorial waters as a way around the Great Northern Barrage, a massive minefield laid from Scotland to Norway as part of the earlier allied blockade strategy.|$|R

50|$|By {{the middle}} of the 17th century the Dutch had built by far the largest <b>mercantile</b> <b>fleet</b> in Europe, with more ships than all the other states combined, and their economy, based mainly on {{maritime}} commerce, gave them a dominant position in European trade, especially in the North Sea and Baltic.

Tromp was killed early in the battle, a blow to morale which increased the Dutch desire to end the war. Similar feelings arose in England. Although many had been enriched by the war (Dutch prizes taken during the war, about 1200 merchantmen or 8% of their total <b>mercantile</b> <b>fleet,</b> amounted to double the value of England's entire ocean-going merchant fleet) trade as a whole had suffered. Cromwell himself was exasperated that two Protestant nations should exhaust themselves in this useless conflict that he had started, while Catholic Spain profited.

50|$|In 1919, {{after the}} end of the First World War, Walchand Hirachand, with several of his friends, bought the SSLoyalty from the Scindias of Gwalior. The vessel was {{originally}} the RMS Empress of India (1891) bought from the Canadian Pacific Railway and paid for by the Maharaja of Gwalior as a hospital ship for Indian troops in the First World War. Hirachand's business premise was that the post-war years would also spell massive growth for the shipping industry just as the war years had done; however, British companies such as Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O) and British-India Steam Navigation Company (BISNC) were strong in the shipping industry and this combined with political inertia had caused most of the previous attempts to establish competing Indian companies to fail. Scindia's founders, Narottam Morarjee and Walchand Hirachand, formed the new company to take on the entrenched British interests and create India's own <b>mercantile</b> <b>fleet.</b> Equipped with a ship Walchand named his company The Scindia Steam Navigation Company Ltd. On 5 April 1919 the SS Loyalty sailed to the United Kingdom.

50|$|The Commonwealth fleet {{blockaded}} Flemish ports but, to Cromwell's annoyance, {{the military}} campaign started {{late in the}} year and was subject to many delays. Marshal Turenne spent the summer of 1657 campaigning against the Spanish in Luxembourg and made no move to attack Flanders until September. Mardyck was captured on 22 September and garrisoned by Commonwealth troops. Dunkirk was besieged in May 1658. A Spanish relief force attempted to lift the siege but was defeated on 4 June at the Battle of the Dunes. The Commonwealth contingent in Turenne's army fought with distinction and impressed their French allies with a successful assault up a strongly defended sandhill 150 feet high during the battle. When Dunkirk surrendered to Turenne on 14 June, Cardinal Mazarin honoured the terms of the treaty with Cromwell and handed the port over to the Commonwealth, despite the protests of Louis XIV. The Commonwealth also honoured its obligations in respecting the rights of the Catholic populations of Mardyck and Dunkirk. A contingent of Commonwealth troops remained with Turenne's army and were instrumental in the capture of Gravelines and other Flemish towns by the French. With the privateering threat of Dunkirk threat out of the way, England's <b>mercantile</b> <b>fleet</b> suffered far fewer losses; not only because the Dunkirkers had lost their largest base but also because English trade had already been largely lost to the Dutch.|$|E
