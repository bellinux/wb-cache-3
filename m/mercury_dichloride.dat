40|$|Salts {{of heavy}} metals are {{excreted}} by the kidneys and, as pro-oxidants, stimulate {{the processes of}} free radical oxidation. Mercury ions are accumulated in the kidneys. So {{the study of the}} features of antioxidant enzymes adaptive response of different kidney layers in response to <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride</b> is important. Catalase and glytathionperoxidase activity within rat kidneys 72 hours after <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride</b> intoxication in the ratio of 5 ml per 1 kg of the animal weight was studied. It was important to reveal the influence of the mercury salts on rat kidney antioxidative system. Decreasing glytathionperoxidase activity in cortical and cerebral substances and renal papillae were accompanied by increased contents of oxidative modified proteins and lipids and morphological changes in renal tissue under salt and water loading after <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride</b> poisoning­. The results obtained evidence for the inhibition of antioxidative protection of enzymes in rat kidneys under the <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride</b> effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{processes}} of lipid peroxidation in the tissues of rats' kidneys {{in case of}} 0. 75 % salt loading in conditions of <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride</b> intoxication were studied in white nonlinear male rats. ' It was found that salt loading on the background of sublimate nephropathy leads to increase of thiobarbiturate-reaction products in different layers of kidneys in comparison with control. Increase of lipid peroxidation products caused disruption of pro-/antioxidant balance. That's why we studied activity of catalase and glutathione-Stramferase in rats' kidneys 72 hours after injection of <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride</b> solution in the dose of 5 mg per 1 kg of animal's body weight, which is important for determination of mercury salts influence on the renal antioxidant system. The decrease of catalase activity in the renal cortex, medulla and papilla in case of salt loading after influence of <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride</b> was found. For instance, loading with 0. 75 % solution of NaCl leads to the twofold increase of glutathione-S-transferase activity in comparison with control. Animals' intoxication with sublimate caused glutathione-S transferase activity increase by 43 % in the renal cortex and twofold - in the renal medulla in comparison with control. These results indicate the inhibition of antioxidant protection enzymes in the rats' kidneys in case of <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride</b> influence. Pathogenetic unity of biochemical processes in the studied areas of the kidney is confirmed by the conducted regression analysis that proves interdependence of lipid peroxidation products with the system of antioxidant protection...|$|E
40|$|Aspidosperma polyneuron is {{a species}} {{native to the}} Neotropics, in {{countries}} like Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, typical of semi-deciduous forests, catalogued since 1998 by the IUCN as "Endangered (EN) ", because its natural populations were subjected to an intense exploitation for timber and its habitat was seriously degraded by agricultural and silvopastoral activities. The difficulties for its natural regeneration and the rooting of cuttings, make the in vitro culture an efficient tool to counteract the reproductive difficulties that it presents. However, the presence of pollutants that affect {{the viability of the}} explants needs the development of protocols that allow the in vitro establishment of this species. The objective of this research was to achieve aseptic establishment and the induction of callogenesis in explants of A. polyneuron, by evaluating different disinfection treatments. The expants were obtained from individuals of natural regeneration, in the Municipality of Armero in the Department of Tolima, which were immersed in distilled water with a drop of Tween® 80 for each 100 ml, for 10 minutes and then rinsed with sterile distilled water. There were used as disinfectant agents, sodium hypochlorite and <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride</b> in different concentrations and times of immersion. Among the used explants: buds, nodal segments and leaf blades, the last one was selected for its capacity of producing friable and green callosity, for which a disinfection with <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride</b> (HgCl 2) 0. 125 % for 10 minutes was enough for contamination control and low indexes of oxidation...|$|E
40|$|Two new psychoactive substances, namely 4 -methylmethcathinone (mephedrone) and 5, 6 -methylenedioxy- 2 -aminoindane (MDAI) were {{analysed}} {{with a novel}} {{combination of}} microcrystalline tests followed by Raman micro-spectroscopy to facilitate their absolute identification. The discrimination power of the proposed combination was successfully demonstrated through {{the analysis of the}} positional isomers 2 - and 3 -methylmethcathinone. The addition of <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride</b> as a microcrystalline test reagent produced specific microcrystals of each tested analyte. The robustness of the method was evaluated in the presence of common cutting agents (caffeine and benzocaine) as well as on street samples. The crystal lattice structures of mephedrone, 2 -methylmethcathinone and MDAI <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride</b> microcrystals were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. This confirmed the presence of both drug and reagent together in the lattice and accounts for the distinct habit of the observed microcrystals. Raman spectra of the formed microcrystals differed from those obtained from their standard salt form by loss and/or gain of some vibrational modes. Particularly important was the appearance of the mercury chloride link to each tested drug molecule which showed as strong bands at low wavenumbers. Its presence was corroborated by its detection in the crystal lattice. It was therefore concluded that microcrystalline testing followed by Raman micro-spectroscopy satisfies the technique combination requirement for psychoactive substances recommended by the Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs (SWGDRUG) and provides a rapid and cheap analysis route. The proposed technique combination also aids the development of new microcrystalline tests as it allows for confirmation of the uniqueness of the developed microcrystals almost in-situ rather than growing single crystals for often long periods of time needed for single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.

40|$|The {{interactions}} of three heavy metal-containing compounds, cisplatin (CDDP), arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3), and <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride</b> (HgCl 2), with the multidrug resistance transporters MRP 1 and MRP 2 and {{the involvement of}} glutathione (GSH) -related processes herein were investigated. In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably expressing MRP 1 or MRP 2, viability, GSH content, calcein efflux and polarized GSH efflux were measured {{as a function of}} exposure to CDDP, As 2 O 3 and HgCl 2. In isolated Sf 9 -MRP 1 and Sf 9 -MRP 2 membrane vesicles, the interaction with MRP-associated ATPase activity was measured. In the latter model system adduct formation with GSH is not an issue. The data show that (1) CDDP interacts with both MRP 1 and MRP 2, and GSH appears to play no major role in this process, (2) As 2 O 3 interacts with MRP 1 and MRP 2 in which process GSH seems to be essential, and (3) HgCl 2 interacts with MRP 1 and MRP 2, either alone and/or as a metal-GSH complex. © 2008 Elsevier B.

A principial {{precondition}} for successful elicitation used {{to increase the}} production of secondary metabolities is, among other, finding a suitable elicitor, its concentration and the optimal period of time of {{the action of the}} elicitor on the plant culture in vitro, which was the aim of the present thesis. The effect was examined of a 6, 24, 48 and 168 hour action of the solution of <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride</b> (in four concentrations) on the production of flavonoids and isoflavonoids in the callus and suspension culture of Trifolium pratense L. cultivated on a Gamborg medium with an addition of 2 mg. l- 1 of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2 mg. l- 1 of 6 -benzylaminopurine, at the temperature of 25 řC and 16 hour light/ 8 hour dark period. The maximal content of flavonoids found by a photometric determination according to Pharmacopoeia Bohemica 2005 was demonstrated in the callus culture (0, 636 %) after 6 hour action of the elicitor of the 100 µmol concentration and in the suspension culture (0, 492 %) after 168 hour action of the elicitor of the 10 µmol concentration. The maximal content of isoflavonoids found by a HPLC method was demonstrated in the suspension culture after 168 hour action of the elicitor of the 100 µmol concentration (0, 03 % of daidzein) and after 168 [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{variable}} β-diketiminate ligand poses as {{a suitable}} chemical environment to explore unknown reactivity and functionality of metal centres. Variants on the β-diketiminate ligand can provide appropriate steric and electronic stabilization to synthesize {{a range of}} β-diketiminate group 12 metal complexes. This project aimed to explore various β-diketiminate ligands as appropriate ancillary ligands to derivatise group 12 element complexes and investigate their reactivity. A β-diketiminato-mercury(II) chloride, [o-C₆H₄{C(CH₃) =N- 2, 6 - iPr₂C₆H₃}{NH(2, 6 - iPr₂C₆H₃) }]HgCl, was synthesized by addition of [o-C₆H₄{C(CH₃) =N- 2, 6 - iPr₂C₆H₃}{NH(2, 6 - iPr₂C₆H₃) }]Li to <b>mercury</b> <b>dichloride.</b> Attempts to derivatise the β-diketiminato-mercury(II) chloride using salt metathesis reactions were unsuccessful with only β-diketiminate ligand degradation products being observed in the ¹H NMR. A β-diketiminato-cadmium chloride, [CH{(CH₃) CN- 2, 6 -iPr₂C₆H₃}₂]CdCl, was derivatized to a β-diketiminato-cadmium phosphanide, [CH{(CH₃) CN- 2, 6 -iPr₂C₆H₃}₂]Cd P(C₆H₁₁) ₂, via a lithium dicyclohexyl phosphanide and a novel β-diketiminato-cadmium hydride, [CH{(CH₃) CN- 2, 6 -iPr₂C₆H₃}₂]CdH, via Super Hydride. Initial reactivity studies of the novel cadmium hydride with various carbodiimides yielded a β-diketiminato-homonuclear cadmium-cadmium dimer, [CH{(CH₃) CN- 2, 6 -iPr₂C₆H₃}₂Cd]₂, which formed via catalytic reduction of the cadmium hydride. Attempts to synthesize an amidinate insertion product via a salt metathesis reaction or a ligand exchange reaction proved unsuccessful but a novel cadmium amidinate, [{CH(N-C₆H₁₁) ₂}₂{CH(N-C₆H₁₁) (N(H) -C₆H₁₁) }Cd], was synthesized from addition of dicyclohexyl formamidine to bis-hexamethyldisilazane cadmium. A β-diketiminato-zinc(II) bromide, [o-C₆H₄{C(CH₃) =N- 2, 6 - iPr₂C₆H₃}{NH(2, 6 - iPr₂C₆H₃) }]ZnBr, was synthesized by addition of [o-C₆H₄{C(CH₃) =N- 2, 6 - iPr₂C₆H₃}{NH(2, 6 - iPr₂C₆H₃) }]Li to zinc dibromide. The β-diketiminato-zinc(II) bromide was derivatized {{to a variety of}} complexes (including amides and phosphanides) by a salt metathesis reaction. Chalcogen addition reactions were performed from [o-C₆H₄{C(CH₃) =N- 2, 6 -iPr₂C₆H₃}{NH(2, 6 -iPr₂C₆H₃) }ZnP(C₆H₁₁) ₂] to produce double addition products from sulfur, selenium and tellurium. Chalcogen addition reactions from [o-C₆H₄{C(CH₃) =N- 2, 6 -iPr₂C₆H₃}{NH(2, 6 -iPr₂C₆H₃) }ZnP(C₆H₅) ₂] produced a double addition product for selenium and a β-diketiminato-zinc(II) tellunoite bridged dimer, [o-C₆H₄{C(CH₃) =N- 2, 6 -iPr₂C₆H₃}{NH(2, 6 -iPr₂C₆H₃) }Zn]Te, from tellurium. A total of 14 compounds were characterized via X-ray diffraction. Photoluminescence studies of the β-diketiminato-zinc(II) compounds were conducted where it was proposed that an electron transfer from the lone pair on the hetero-atom influenced the quantum yield and fluorescence intensities...|$|E
