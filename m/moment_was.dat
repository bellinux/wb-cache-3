5|$|By 1973 the {{magnetic}} <b>moment</b> <b>was</b> known within {{a factor of}} two, whereas the tilt was correctly estimated at about 10°. The modulation of Jupiter's DAM by Io (the so-called Io-DAM) was discovered in 1964, and allowed Jupiter's rotation period to be precisely determined. The definitive discovery of the Jovian magnetic field occurred in December 1973, when the Pioneer 10 spacecraft flew near the planet.|$|E
5|$|The expedition's {{success was}} widely applauded, though {{the story of}} Scott's heroic failure overshadowed its {{achievement}} in the United Kingdom. Amundsen's decision to keep his true plans secret until the last <b>moment</b> <b>was</b> criticised by some. Recent polar historians have more fully recognised the skill and courage of Amundsen's party; the permanent scientific base at the pole bears his name, together with that of Scott.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> a {{specific}} quantitative measure, {{used in both}} mechanics and statistics, of {{the shape of a}} set of points. If the points represent mass, then the zeroth <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the total mass, the first moment divided by the total mass is the center of mass, and the second <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the rotational inertia. If the points represent probability density, then the zeroth <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the total probability (i.e. one), the first <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the mean, the second central <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the variance, the third central <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the skewness, and the fourth central moment (with normalization and shift) is the kurtosis. The mathematical concept is closely related to the concept of moment in physics.|$|R

5|$|The {{painting}} glorifies {{this event}} in Poland's past and its culture, and {{the majesty of}} its kings. At the same time, the painting has darker undertones, reflecting the troubled times that befell Poland {{in the late eighteenth}} century, for the Kingdom of Prussia would become one of the partitioning powers that ended the independence of Poland. The painting was seen by some as anti-Prussian, foretelling its perceived betrayal of Poland; others have noted it is also critical of Poland, as Matejko included signs that signify this seemingly triumphant <b>moment</b> <b>was</b> a hollow, wasted victory. Matejko created his painting to remind others {{about the history of the}} no-longer-independent country he loved, and about the changing fates of history. The painting is counted among his masterpieces.|$|E
5|$|The {{results were}} not immediate. In 1862, cattle sold at La Souterraine weighed about 600kg. The decline of Anglomania {{in favour of}} {{economic}} pragmatism, and the criticism {{and fall of the}} aristocracy aided the development of Limousin cattle. The Limousin breed became renowned for the quality of its meat and the exceptional performance of its carcase, and was voted best European breed in 1857, 1858 and 1859 during the food animal competitions held in Poissy. The crowning <b>moment</b> <b>was</b> the honour received by the bull Achilles Caillaud to open the competition in Paris for all breeds in 1886 (the year the Limousin Herd Book was created), and the grand champion prize of all breeds won three years later by Charles Léobardy for his team.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{hypotheses}} for {{the origin}} of the Laplace resonance among Io, Europa, and Ganymede: that it is primordial and has existed {{from the beginning of the}} Solar System; or that it developed after the formation of the Solar System. A possible sequence of events for the latter scenario is as follows: Io raised tides on Jupiter, causing Io's orbit to expand (due to conservation of momentum) until it encountered the 2:1 resonance with Europa; after that the expansion continued, but some of the angular <b>moment</b> <b>was</b> transferred to Europa as the resonance caused its orbit to expand as well; the process continued until Europa encountered the 2:1 resonance with Ganymede. Eventually the drift rates of conjunctions between all three moons were synchronized and locked in the Laplace resonance.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{statistical}} approaches for unsupervised learning is the method of moments. In the method of moments, the unknown parameters (of interest) in the model {{are related to the}} moments of one or more random variables, and thus, these unknown parameters can be estimated given the <b>moments.</b> The <b>moments</b> <b>are</b> usually estimated from samples empirically. The basic <b>moments</b> <b>are</b> first and second order moments. For a random vector, the first order <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the mean vector, and the second order <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the covariance matrix (when the mean is zero). Higher order <b>moments</b> <b>are</b> usually represented using tensors which are the generalization of matrices to higher orders as multi-dimensional arrays.|$|R

5|$|Crosby went on {{to compete}} in two World Junior Championships with Team Canada's under-20 team. When he {{was named to the}} team in December 2003, he became the fifth sixteen-year-old to {{represent}} Canada at the tournament, following Jay Bouwmeester, Jason Spezza, Eric Lindros, and Wayne Gretzky. Competing in the 2004 World Junior Championships in Helsinki, he then became the youngest player to score a goal {{in the history of the}} tournament at 16years, 4months, and 21days when he scored against Switzerland in a 7–2 win. This record would last until the 2012 World Juniors, when Aleksander Barkov of Finland scored a goal aged 16years, 4months. Crosby finished the tournament with 2 goals and 3 assists in 6 games, helping Canada to a silver medal finish. The following year, he returned for Team Canada at the 2005 World Junior Championships in Grand Forks. He improved to 6 goals and 3 assists as Canada earned gold. Crosby stated the following year that his most memorable hockey <b>moment</b> <b>was</b> winning his World Junior gold medal.|$|E
5|$|The cup defeat {{prompted}} Wenger {{make changes}} to his squad. He signed young England internationals Richard Wright and Francis Jeffers, midfielder Giovanni van Bronckhorst from Rangers {{as a partner}} for Vieira, and convinced defender Sol Campbell to join from local rivals Tottenham Hotspur on a free transfer. Campbell's arrival strengthened a defence which {{was going through a}} transition phase from 1999 and 2001; Steve Bould and Nigel Winterburn moved on in this period, club graduate Ashley Cole displaced Sylvinho as Wenger's first choice left back, while Lauren acted as Lee Dixon's understudy. Midfielders Fredrik Ljungberg and Robert Pirès – brought in during preceding transfer windows, had now established themselves into the first team. The 2001–02 season brought much success as Wenger led Arsenal to the double once more. The crowning <b>moment</b> <b>was</b> the win against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the penultimate game of the season. Sylvain Wiltord scored the winning goal to secure the club's 12th league championship and third double; four days earlier, Arsenal beat Chelsea 2–0 in the 2002 FA Cup Final. The team scored in every single league fixture and were unbeaten away from home that season.|$|E
