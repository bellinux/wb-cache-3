30|$|Figure  3 {{shows the}} {{relationship}} between sulfur saturation and water breakthrough time in different distances between gas well and edge water. The larger the amount of final sulfur deposition in the pore is, the shorter the water breakthrough time, which shows that the sulfur deposition can accelerate the water breakthrough time and has a <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> on the gas reservoir development. Mainly because the final sulfur deposition in the pore is greater, the greater damage to reservoir permeability and the greater pressure drop is, the greater the flow rate of gas reservoir is, bring the shorter the water breakthrough time. Also {{it can be seen}} from Fig.  3, the farther the distance between gas well and water boundary is, the <b>more</b> obvious <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> of sulfur deposition on the water breakthrough time. The longer the distance between gas well and water boundary is, the more serious the pressure loss of gas reservoir is, the greater pressure drop and the more sulfur precipitation is. And precipitated sulfur accelerates gas well water breakthrough. So, precipitated sulfur has a <b>more</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> on water breakthrough time in a long distance between gas well and edge water.|$|R

50|$|The term brother {{comes from}} the Proto-Indo-European *bʰréh₂tēr, which becomes Latin frater, of the same meaning. Sibling warmth, or sibling affect between male {{siblings}} has been correlated to some <b>more</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects.</b> In pairs of brothers higher sibling warmth is related to more risk taking behaviour although risk taking behaviour {{is not related to}} sibling warmth in any other type of sibling pair. The cause of this phenomenon in which sibling warmth is only correlated with risk taking behaviours in brother pairs still is unclear. This finding does, however, suggest that although sibling conflict is a risk factor for risk taking behaviour, sibling warmth does not serve as a protective factor. Some studies suggest that girls having an older brother delays the onset of menarche by roughly one year. Research also suggests that the likelihood of being gay increases with the more older brothers a man has. Some analyzers have suggested that a man's attractiveness to a hetero woman may increase with the more he resembles her brother, while his unattractiveness may increase the more his likeness diverges from her brother.|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} effect of import {{competition}} on company training in the United States. Focus {{on the effects of}} imports on training is important, since such training {{is an important factor in}} earnings and job security. Specifically, I look at {{the effect of}} imports at the three digit industry level on the incidence of company training for individuals in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, and thus extend empirical trade research to micro data on individuals. Overall, I find that import competition has a <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> on company training, especially for non-production workers. I also find that imports from low- and middle-income countries have a <b>more</b> severe <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> on training than do those from high-income countries. However, I do not find a significant difference between the effect of imports in high-technology and low-technology industries. Finally, I find that the final goods imports in an industry has a <b>more</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> on training than the imports of intermediate goods in the industry. Thus it is not surprising there is pressure to limit import competition, especially from low- or middle-income countries, since reduced training opportunities for U.

30|$|The {{bottom hole}} {{pressure}} {{has influence on}} the sulfur deposition and water breakthrough time. The lower bottom hole pressure is, the more the amount of released sulfur and the shorter water breakthrough time is. Precipitated sulfur damages reservoir permeability and diminishes effective seepage distance, which accelerates gas well water breakthrough. The longer the distance between gas well and water boundary is, the more serious the pressure loss of gas reservoir is, the greater pressure drop and the more sulfur precipitation is. So, precipitated sulfur has a <b>more</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> on water breakthrough {{time in a long}} distance between gas well and edge water.|$|R

5000|$|The CCT program, BJA, had <b>more</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> on {{the women}} than positive, {{according}} to the indigenous women of Bolivia. The women were required to go to education classes, participate in maternal health activities and go to family planning sessions. They were not educated about their rights. In addition, women had to surrender their rights to reproduce because of the BJA regulations. For, example, women {{would have to wait}} two years to have another child in order to have another cash transfer, but if they did conceive a child then the second cash transfer would be postponed. [...] Another obstacle for Bolivian women nearing labor is that they are required to give birth in hospitals instead of their homes. This requirement allows them to receive proper maternal care. However, the women would have to walk or travel a far distance {{in order to get to}} the nearest hospital. There is a health clinic serving as a waiting place for them before they are about to go into labor. With the different atmosphere of hospitals and waiting clinics, and with differences between hospital staff and the indigenous women, there is a gap of misunderstanding of cultural tradition and the BJA's regulations.|$|E
50|$|CLT {{can also}} be used to explain stereotypes. The abstractness of the {{representations}} we have of people or groups can change our judgment of people who do not fit in the same categories as ourselves and are therefore more socially distant. For example, when viewing a different group of people in a more distant or high-level way, one may easily use abstract or centralized views. Viewing a group of teenagers in the mall, an adult may think that they are up to no good, or that they are trouble-makers. This is an overall abstract and centralized view focused only on one broad aspect of the group. These views are usually incorrect, and can lead to stereotypes and discrimination. Similarly, thinking of others on the lower level, such as people that the individual knows personally (i.e., less distant people), allows for more detailed ideas and perceptions of those people. Therefore, these perceptions are often more correct and less likely to create or strengthen stereotypes. The more social distance there is between groups, the more it increases discrimination against groups that are racially or sexually different from ourselves. When people are categorized in such a way that is distinctly different from oneself (that is, psychologically distant from the self) and are thus viewed in more abstract terms, there tend to be <b>more</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects.</b> Increasing other types of psychological distance (e.g., temporal, spatial) can increase social distance between groups, leading to more of these negative intergroup outcomes.|$|E
5000|$|Social {{inhibition}} {{can range}} from normal reactions to social situations to a pathological level, associated with psychological disorders like social anxiety or social phobia. Life events are important and are related to our well-being and inhibition levels. In a lab study conducted by Buck and colleagues, social inhibition in everyday life was reviewed. Researchers observed how individuals interacted and communicated about different stimuli. In this study, there were female participants called [...] "senders" [...] who viewed twelve emotionally loaded stimuli. There were also {{participants in the study}} called [...] "received" [...] who had to guess which stimuli was viewed by the senders. The senders were either alone, with a friend, or with a stranger while viewing the slides. The results of the study revealed that being with a stranger had inhibitory effects on communication, whereas being with a friend had facilitative effects with some stimuli and inhibitory effects with others. The results show how anyone can be inhibited in daily life, with strangers or even friends. Inhibition can also be determined by one's sensitivity levels to different social cues throughout the day. Gable and colleagues conducted a study in which they examined different events participants would record {{at the end of their}} day. Participants were also measured on the behavioral activation system and the behavioral inhibition system. The results revealed that individuals with more sensitivity on the behavioral inhibition system reported having <b>more</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> from daily events.|$|E
