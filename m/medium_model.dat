40|$|We {{describe}} the fractal solid {{by a special}} continuous <b>medium</b> <b>model.</b> We propose to {{describe the}} fractal solid by a fractional continuous <b>medium</b> <b>model,</b> where all characteristics and fields are defined everywhere in the volume but they follow some generalized equations which are derived by using fractional integrals of fractional order. The order of fractional integral can be equal to the fractal mass dimension of the solid. Fractional integrals are considered as an approximation of integrals on fractals.

40|$|A {{simplified}} approach which utilizes an isotropic porous <b>medium</b> <b>model</b> {{has been widely}} adopted for modeling the flow through a compact heat exchanger. With respect to situations where the compact heat exchangers are partially installed inside a channel, such as the application of recuperators in an intercooled recuperative engine, {{the use of an}} isotropic porous <b>medium</b> <b>model</b> needs to be carefully assessed because the flow passing through the heat exchanger is very complicated. For this purpose, in this study the isotropic porous <b>medium</b> <b>model</b> is assessed together with specific pressure–velocity relationships for flow field modeling inside a rectangular channel with a built-in double-U-shaped tube bundle heat exchanger. Firstly, experiments were conducted using models to investigate the relationship between the pressure drop and the inlet velocity for a specific heat exchanger with different installation angles inside a rectangular channel. Secondly, a series of numerical computations were carried out using the isotropic porous <b>medium</b> <b>model</b> and the pressure–velocity relationship was then modified by introducing correction coefficients empirically. Finally, a three-dimensional (3 -D) direct computation was made using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method for the comparison of detailed flow fields. The results suggest that the isotropic porous <b>medium</b> <b>model</b> is capable of making precise pressure drop predictions given the reasonable pressure–velocity relationship but is unable to precisely simulate the detailed flow features...|$|E

Constructed stochastic random elastic fluctuations were embedded over mean background elastic parameters.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that some long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) {{arise from the}} core collapse of massive stars, and thus {{it is inevitable that}} the environments of these GRBs are preburst stellar winds or dense media. We studied, for the first time, the wind model for afterglows based on the Blandford-McKee self-similar solution of a relativistic shock, and suggested that GRB 970616 is an interactor with a stellar wind. We also proposed a dense <b>medium</b> <b>model</b> for some afterglows, e. g., the steepening in the light curve of the R-band afterglow of GRB 990123 may be caused by the adiabatic shock which has evolved from an ultrarelativistic phase to a nonrelativistic phase in a dense medium. We further discussed the dense <b>medium</b> <b>model</b> in more details, and investigated the effects of synchrotron self absorption and energy injection. A shock in a dense medium becomes nonrelativistic rapidly after a short relativistic phase. The afterglow from the shock at the nonrelativistic stage decays more rapidly than at the relativistic stage. Since some models for GRB energy sources predicted that a strongly magnetic millisecond pulsar may be born during GRB formation, we discussed the effect of such a pulsar on the evolution of the nonrelativistic shock through magnetic dipole radiation. We found that in the pulsar energy injection case, the dense <b>medium</b> <b>model</b> fits very well all the observational data of GRB 980519. Recently, we combined the dense <b>medium</b> <b>model</b> with the pulsar energy injection effect to provide a good fit to the optical afterglow data of GRB 000301 C. ...|$|E
