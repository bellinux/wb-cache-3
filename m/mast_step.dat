5|$|The hull {{had four}} levels {{separated}} by three decks. The terminology for {{these in the}} 16th century was still not standardised so the terms used here are those that were applied by the Mary Rose Trust. The hold lay furthest down in the ship, right above the bottom planking below the waterline. This is where the kitchen, or galley, was situated and the food was cooked. Directly aft of the galley was the <b>mast</b> <b>step,</b> a rebate in the centre-most timber of the keelson, right above the keel, which supported the main mast, and next to it the main bilge pump. To increase {{the stability of the}} ship, the hold was where the ballast was placed and much of the supplies were kept. Right above the hold was the orlop, the lowest deck. Like the hold it was partitioned and was also used as a storage area for everything from food to spare sails.|$|E
2500|$|The English word [...] "tabernacle" [...] {{is derived}} from the Latin tabernāculum meaning [...] "tent" [...] or [...] "hut", which in ancient Roman {{religion}} was a ritual structure. Other uses of this word include nautical usage, referring to a <b>mast</b> <b>step,</b> which by its arrangement of boards allows the mast to be raised and lowered, and textiles industry usage, referring to a similar wooden bar scaffold used for holding a large rug while weaving.|$|E
2500|$|Dennison J. Lawlor was {{a famous}} Boston Naval {{architect}} who produced a line plan in which the Sparrow-Hawk had two masts. The forward mast carried a single square sail, the mizzen mast (after mast) carried a lateen sail. It was decided by a 'Mr. Sanders' [...] to use Lawlor's plan but reduce the depth to about 8'. Common arcs of circles replaced the sheer line with [...] "lively rise" [...] at both ends. Paintings of small square stern ships of this period show an overhang aft, instead of a flat transom, with an outboard rudder as drawn by Lawlor. [...] Sander's rig {{takes into account the}} <b>mast</b> <b>step,</b> and thereby reduced the rig to two possibilities: 'simple' three masted; or the two-masted, square rig known in the 17th century ships as a Barque.|$|E

50|$|A boat or yacht that is Cat-rigged has {{a single}} <b>mast,</b> <b>stepped</b> well forward, {{carrying}} a single fore and aft sail, behind the mast. A boat that is cat-rigged can also be described as having a Una rig.|$|R
50|$|Log canoes {{had one or}} two masts. Two-masted boats on the Chesapeake—not just log canoes—were often {{provided}} with a <b>mast</b> <b>step</b> to allow sailing with {{just one of the}} two sails.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mast</b> <b>step</b> - A socket, often strengthened, to {{take the}} {{downward}} thrust of the mast and hold it in position. May be on the keel or on the deck in smaller craft.|$|E
50|$|A singlehanded {{option was}} envisaged, with a forward <b>mast</b> <b>step</b> position, a second, forward set of chainplates, and {{corresponding}} set of anchor {{points for the}} mainsheet bridle. With a longer tiller extension, the boat could then be sailed using just the mainsail and trapeze, Contender-style.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mast</b> <b>Stepping</b> {{ceremony}} {{is a similar}} event which occurs {{towards the end of}} a ship's construction, and involves the placing of coins underneath the mast of a ship. In shipbuilding today, the coins are normally welded beneath the radar mast.|$|R
50|$|The Norfolk wherry {{is a type}} of boat used on The Broads in Norfolk and Suffolk, England. Three main types were {{developed}} over its life, all featuring the distinctive gaff rig with a single, high-peaked sail and the <b>mast</b> <b>stepped</b> well forward.|$|R
5000|$|The Sturgeon-class destroyers {{served with}} the Royal Navy from 1894; three were built by the Vickers yard and {{differed}} from other similar ships in having their <b>mast</b> <b>stepped</b> before the first funnel. They had Blechynden boilers which gave them [...] and 27 kn. They were armed with one twelve pounder and two torpedo tubes. They carried a complement of 53 officers and men.|$|R
50|$|Finally, the {{fittings}} such as swivels or crutch plate, painter ring, stretchers, keel {{and stem}} band are fitted and fixed with screws. In a sailing dinghy, {{there would be}} more fittings such as fairleads, horse, shroud plates, <b>mast</b> <b>step,</b> toe straps and so on.|$|E
50|$|The Optimist has a pram hull, {{originally}} formed {{primarily from}} five pieces of plywood. It {{was the biggest}} hull Clark Mills could make from two 4 ft by 8 ft sheets. Just {{in front of a}} bulkhead, which partitions the boat nearly in half, is the daggerboard case. Right behind it on the centerline of the hull floor are attached a pulley and ratchet block. These anchor the sheet and its pulley on the boom directly above. At the bow resides a thwart to support the mast which passes through a hole in its centre to the <b>mast</b> <b>step</b> mounted on the centre line of the boat. The painter, a rope used for securing a boat like a mooring line, is usually tied around the <b>mast</b> <b>step.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1963, {{during the}} musealization {{of the ship}} and the {{relocation}} of the mainmast, engineer Guido Ucelli di Nemi (President of the Museum) donated a gold coin that was placed in the <b>mast</b> <b>step,</b> as was in use in ancient times when the construction of a ship was completed.|$|E
50|$|A cat-ketch is a {{sailboat}} that is rigged {{as both a}} catboat and a ketch. Specifically, there is larger <b>mast</b> <b>stepped</b> at the very bow, and a smaller mast further aft. It is different from a standard ketch rig {{because there is no}} jib, and the foremost mast is further forward than most ketches. This rig is found on amongst others Sharpies, Sea Pearl 21, Freedom Yachts and Wyliecats.|$|R
50|$|A silver coin or coins {{sometimes}} are {{placed under the}} mast or in the keel of a ship as a good luck charm. This tradition probably originated with the Romans. The tradition continues in modern times, for example, officers of USS New Orleans placed 33 coins heads up under her foremast and mainmast before she was launched in 1933 and USS Higgins, commissioned in 1999, had 11 coins specially selected for her <b>mast</b> <b>stepping.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the 1972 Olympics, sailed in Kiel, {{the great}} Brazilian Finn sailor Joerg Bruder {{competed in the}} Star Class. On {{the way out of}} the harbor, Bruder and his crew Jan Aten snagged a shroud on a piling and brought the rig down on their heads. They brought the boat back to the dock, brought down a spare <b>mast,</b> <b>stepped</b> it, rigged it and sailed out to win that day's race. Dick Enersen ...|$|R
5000|$|The boat is open, no decked-over areas. The rails (deck {{topsides}} or gunwales) are {{10 inches}} wide at the beam. A <b>mast</b> <b>step</b> is molded into {{the deck and}} the mast supported by cast aluminum bracket attached to the bow section. A flared spray molding extends along the forward deck section aft.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ship was}} in use by merchants for 15-25 years. Knowing {{that the ship}} was old, archaeologists could use the repairs on the Kyrenia to better {{understand}} classical carpentry. The hull’s age increased {{the need for the}} defense against water loss, so any repairs would give very specific evidence to the problems facing ancient ships. A break in the ship’s keel was fixed, and the outside of the ship was protected with pitch and lead sheathing. These measures were taken to extend the ship’s lifespan. Closer analysis of the rabbets in the hull’s frame suggest that the <b>mast</b> <b>step</b> had been moved up to three, and possibly four times. This movement happens to be in close proximity with a well to collect bilge water. Because of this, archaeologists surmise that the movement of the <b>mast</b> <b>step</b> was {{to make way for a}} larger bilge pump, capable of dealing with the greater needs of the aging ship. [...] The extreme measures to deal with water infiltration corroborate the frailty of this ship, which very likely contributed to the ship’s sinking.|$|E
5000|$|The English word [...] "tabernacle" [...] {{is derived}} from the Latin tabernāculum meaning [...] "tent" [...] or [...] "hut", which in ancient Roman {{religion}} was a ritual structure.

50|$|In a <b>Mast</b> <b>Stepping</b> {{ceremony}} on July 21, 1982, silver dollars {{were placed}} {{at the base of}} the new hospital’s flag poles. The placing of the coins, honoring the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Surgeon General, is taken from an ancient Roman custom. The tradition of placing coins at the foot of a ship’s mast was said to ensure that the fare of all hands on board was paid for passage across the River Styx.|$|R
50|$|The little {{fishing port}} of Polperro, 5 {{miles west of}} Looe had a fleet of small sailing fishing boats known as Polperro Gaffers. Their {{principal}} catch was the pilchard {{but this was a}} late summer catch {{and the rest of the}} year they set long lines, and seine nets. Most were built in Looe, around 26' with a deep 6' draft, a gaff rig on a pole <b>mast</b> <b>stepped</b> on the keel and they dried out on legs in Polperro's drying harbour.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sharp complied, {{and in a}} {{few minutes}} the launch was {{floating}} slowly away from the hospitable bank of sand. Paul hauled out the jigger, a small sprit-sail, that kept itself close-hauled from being fastened to a stationary boom, and a little <b>mast</b> <b>stepped</b> quite aft, the effect of which was to press the boat against the wind. This brought the launch's head up, and it was just possible to see, by close attention, that they had a slight motion through the water.|$|R
50|$|A {{forensic}} {{study of}} the wreck suggested that the ship had steerage and was sailing for shelter when it sank. The mizzen mast snapped off above the deck and the upper portion was not located. The main mast was found forward and to the port side of the wreck with the base missing. The foremast is intact and lies nearly parallel but {{on top of the}} main mast suggesting {{at least one of these}} masts fell out of the <b>mast</b> <b>step</b> as the ship went down.|$|E
5000|$|In sailboating and shipbuilding, Mast Stepping is {{the process}} of raising the boat's mast. It also refers to a {{ceremonial}} occasion which occurs when the mast is stepped, towards the end of a ship's construction. The ceremony involves placing or welding one or more coins into the <b>mast</b> <b>step</b> of a ship, and is seen as an important ceremonial occasion in a ship's construction which is thought to bring good luck. [...] Although the coins were originally placed under the main-mast of a ship, they are now generally welded under the radar mast.|$|E
50|$|It is {{reasonable}} to assume that galleys in both Western Scotland and the West of Ireland were built in accordance with well-established shipwrights' techniques of north-west Europe, of which the Norse were major exponents. There was extensive Norse settlement both on the west coast of Scotland and around the coasts of Ireland. Norse shipwrights attached both the stem and stern to the keel with scarfed joints, the hull itself being clinker-built with iron nails. Ribs were attached to the strakes with cords or trenails, and thwarts installed. The mast was then inserted in the <b>mast</b> <b>step.</b> The stem and stern posts would have notches to receive the ends of planks, and knees secured the thwarts.|$|E

50|$|Much like a co-operative, the Sailing Center {{owns and}} {{maintains}} over 80 boats and provides members no-charge {{access to the}} fleet after they successfully demonstrate basic sailing skills and earn a rating. Membership is low cost, less {{than the cost of}} insurance on a privately owned sailboat, and works on a sliding scale based on age, experience and income. The Sailing Center also offers private boat owners 24-hour access to the lake, year-round boat and dinghy storage, <b>mast</b> <b>stepping</b> boat launching and haul out services.|$|R
50|$|Early bomb vessels were rigged as ketches {{with two}} masts. They were awkward vessels to handle, {{in part because}} bomb ketches {{typically}} had the <b>masts</b> <b>stepped</b> farther aft than would have been normal in other vessels of similar rig, {{in order to accommodate}} the mortars forward and provide a clear area for their forwards fire. As a result, by the 1800s British bomb vessels were designed as full rigged ships with three masts, and two mortars, one between each neighboring pair of masts. Bomb vessels often had the front rigging made of chain, to better withstand the muzzle blast of the mortars.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the type}} of short steep waves which occur in Dublin Bay, Ireland, some owners of the Dun Laoghaire International 12 footers under the {{recommendation}} of J.J. O'Leary, modified the design in the 1960s {{to reduce the amount of}} water taken over the bow. They modified the design by putting a small foredeck with washboards, inserting a new <b>mast</b> <b>step</b> aft of the existing step, cutting a circular hole in the forward thwart, moving the mast aft, shortening the boom, cutting down the size of the mainsail, and hoisting a small jib borrowed from the other Dublin Bay classic dinghy class the Water Wag. The modification was declared a success, and the modified fleet sailed and raced for about another 10 years. No alterations were made to the hull, or underwater appendages - so the alterations should be reversible.|$|E
5000|$|All Bristols {{included}} an interior overhead fiberglass headliner that hid rough, irregular fiberglass {{on the inside}} of the cabin. The cabinetry was fiberglassed to the hull, rather than using an interior liner with molded cabinetry, which significantly added to the structural integrity of the hull. The cabinetry was built from 3/4" [...] mahogany plywood, attached with bronze wood screws and glued. The hulls of early Bristols were all solid, hand-laid fiberglass. The decks and cabin tops were cored with end-grain balsa. The cored structure extended to the cockpit seat tops and the cockpit sole. Rudder posts and propeller shafts were solid bronze. Bronze Wilcox Crittenden tapered-plug seacocks were used on all underwater thru-hulls. A distinguishing feature of virtually all Bristol models included at least two moulded dorade boxes on the cabin top abaft the <b>mast</b> <b>step</b> that allowed ventilation in rough seas or rainy weather.|$|E
