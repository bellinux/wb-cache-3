5|$|Complete skeletons {{have been}} {{described}} only for the <b>most</b> <b>advanced</b> abelisaurids (such as Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus), {{making it difficult to}} establish defining features of the skeleton for the family as a whole. However, most are known from at least some skull bones, so known shared features come mainly from the skull.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{all three}} ships was ordered halted on 10 July 1941, and the Sovetsky Soyuz was placed into {{long-term}} conservation as the <b>most</b> <b>advanced</b> ship. However, all three were officially stricken from the Navy List on 10 September 1941.|$|E

5|$|There were {{periods of}} renewed prosperity. The Cambrian Mills in Newtown was {{purchased}} in 1866 by the Cambrian Flannel Company of Newtown and Llanidloes, which modernized the factory {{so it was}} the <b>most</b> <b>advanced</b> facility in Wales and diversified into making plain and coloured flannels, shawls, whittles, hose and tweeds.|$|E
5|$|Caerphilly's water defences {{were almost}} {{certainly}} inspired by those at Kenilworth, where a similar set of artificial lakes and dams was created. Gilbert de Clare had fought at {{the siege of}} Kenilworth in 1266 and would have seen these at first hand. Caerphilly's water defences provided particular protection against mining, which could otherwise undermine castle walls during the period, and are considered the <b>most</b> <b>advanced</b> of their kind in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Chesma (Russian: Чесма, {{sometimes}} transliterated as Tchesma) was {{the second}} ship of the s built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s. When the ship was completed she proved to be very overweight which meant that much of her waterline armor belt was submerged. Russian companies could not produce the <b>most</b> <b>advanced</b> armour and machinery desired by the Naval General Staff, so they were imported from the United Kingdom and Belgium. Chesma spent her career {{as part of the}} Black Sea Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Conveyor belts offer a very {{efficient}} method of loading, with standard loading rates varying between 100 and 700tons per hour, although the <b>most</b> <b>advanced</b> ports can offer rates of 16,000tons per hour. Start-up and shutdown procedures with conveyor belts, though, are complicated and require time to carry out. Self-discharging ships use conveyor belts with load rates of around 1,000tons per hour.|$|E
5|$|Emulating {{the style}} of Cirque du Soleil, Circus Juventas's first show was at Saint Paul's Highland Fest in 1995. From there, the school's {{enrollment}} quickly expanded and the organization initiated a campaign to fund a $2.1 million permanent big top facility, which opened in 2001 on Saint Paul parkland in the Highland Park neighborhood. That year, it began to produce annual summer performances showcasing the work of its <b>most</b> <b>advanced</b> students, each with a distinct theme.|$|E

50|$|USTCON is {{a special}} case of STCON (directed reachability), the problem of {{determining}} whether a directed path between two vertices in a directed graph exists, which is complete for NL. Because USTCON is SL-complete, <b>most</b> <b>advances</b> that impact USTCON have also impacted SL. Thus they are connected, and discussed together.|$|R
5|$|Expansion of {{teaching}} and research activities continues. In 2004, the Faculty of Engineering completed work on the Bristol Laboratory for Advanced Dynamics Engineering (BLADE). This £18.5m project provides cutting-edge technology to further the study of dynamics and is the <b>most</b> <b>advanced</b> such facility in Europe. It was built as an extension to the Queen's Building and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in March 2005.|$|E
5|$|Finland, the United States and Sweden are the <b>most</b> <b>advanced</b> in {{developing}} a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal. Countries vary in their plans on disposing used fuel directly or after reprocessing, with France and Japan having an extensive commitment to reprocessing. The country-specific status of high-level waste management plans are described below.|$|E
5|$|New villages appeared, {{consisting}} of timber houses built {{side by side}} in equal parcels of land. For instance, the scarcely inhabited forests of the Western Carpathians (in present-day Slovakia) developed a network of settlements under Béla IV. Huts disappeared, and new rural houses {{consisting of}} a living room, a kitchen and a pantry were built. The <b>most</b> <b>advanced</b> agricultural techniques, including asymmetric heavy ploughs, also spread throughout the kingdom.|$|E
50|$|The {{establishment}} of LGBT {{rights in the}} U.S. state of Iowa is a recent phenomenon, with <b>most</b> <b>advances</b> in LGBT rights taking place since 2007. Iowa began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on April 27, 2009 following a ruling by the Iowa Supreme Court, making Iowa the fourth U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage.|$|R

5|$|Royd House {{was built}} between 1914 and 1916, by local {{architect}} Edgar Wood, {{as his own}} residence. It has a flat concrete roof, a concave façade, and is faced in Portland red stone and Lancashire brick. It is {{regarded as one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>advanced</b> examples of early 20th-century domestic architecture, and is referenced in architectural digests. It has been a GradeI listed building since 1975, one of six such buildings in Trafford. The Grade II listed clock outside the main transport interchange was built in 1880.|$|E
5|$|The Lexington-class {{ships were}} {{originally}} designed to be battlecruisers, with heavy guns, high speed, and moderate armor protection. The Navy laid down six ships of the class in 1919–20. When the battlecruisers were cancelled under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, two of the unfinished ships were designated for completion as carriers. Lexington and Saratoga were selected since they were the <b>most</b> <b>advanced</b> of the six ships in construction.|$|E

5|$|The United Nations Security Council {{brokered}} the Renville Agreement in {{an attempt}} to rectify the collapsed Linggarjati Agreement. The agreement was ratified in January 1948 and recognised a cease-fire along the so-called 'Van Mook line'; an artificial line which connected the <b>most</b> <b>advanced</b> Dutch positions. Many Republican positions, however, were still held behind the Dutch lines. The agreement also required referenda to be held on the political future of the Dutch held areas. The apparent reasonableness of Republicans garnered much important American goodwill.|$|E
5|$|The chief Roman {{contributions}} to architecture were the arch, vault and the dome. Even {{after more than}} 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand, {{due in part to}} sophisticated methods of making cements and concrete. Roman roads are considered the <b>most</b> <b>advanced</b> roads built until the early 19th century. The system of roadways facilitated military policing, communications, and trade. The roads were resistant to floods and other environmental hazards. Even {{after the collapse of the}} central government, some roads remained usable for more than a thousand years.|$|E
