5|$|Since Gliese 581c has {{not been}} {{detected}} directly, there are no measurements of its radius. Furthermore, the radial velocity <b>method</b> <b>used</b> to detect it only puts a lower limit on the planet's mass, which means theoretical models of planetary radius and structure can only be of limited use.

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity <b>method</b> <b>used</b> to detect 47 Ursae Majoris b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. Preliminary astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite suggest the planet's orbit is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to {{the plane of the}} sky, which would imply a true mass 12% greater than the lower limit determined by radial velocity measurements. However, subsequent investigation of the data reduction techniques used suggests that the Hipparcos measurements are not precise enough to adequately characterise the orbits of substellar companions, and the true inclination of the orbit (and hence the true mass) are regarded as unknown.|$|E

In this paper, six types of noise image detection method are prepared: the <b>method</b> <b>using</b> visual feature, the <b>method</b> <b>using</b> semantic feature, two <b>methods</b> <b>using</b> both features in parallel and two <b>methods</b> <b>using</b> both features in serial.

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity <b>method</b> <b>used</b> to detect Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value depends on the inclination of the orbit, which is not determined by the radial velocity measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets {{can be used to}} determine the true masses. Using this method, the inclination of the orbit can be determined, revealing the planet's true mass to be 0.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity <b>method</b> <b>used</b> to discover 55 Cancri d is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. In the case of 55 Cancri d, this lower limit was around 3.835 times the mass of Jupiter. In 2004, astrometric measurements with the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the planet's orbit is inclined by around 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. If this measurement is confirmed, it implies that the planet's true mass is 25% greater than the lower limit, at around 4.8 Jupiter masses; and it will not be coplanar with the innermost planets e and b (both 85°).|$|E

For example, the historian Robert Hartwell has estimated that per capita iron output rose sixfold between 806 and 1078, such that, by 1078 China was producing 127000000kg (125,000t) in weight of iron per year.

As such, the effect of the regulation allocated all of the steelhead trout fishing to sport anglers, and none to the tribes.|$|E
5|$|Boxwood {{cut across}} the end-grain is hard enough for fine engraving, {{allowing}} greater detail than in normal woodcutting. This been the dominant <b>method</b> <b>used</b> since Bewick's time. In addition, since a wood engraving is inked on the face, it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for many thousands of prints, and importantly can be assembled into a page of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run. In contrast, a copper plate engraving is inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped clean of ink before printing, so much higher pressure is required, and images must be printed separately from the text, at far greater expense.|$|E
