5000|$|This {{intellectual}} <b>movement</b> <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> a {{long period}} of years and can be split into two periods. The first period extends from about 306 to 30 BC, the time from the foundation of the Ptolemaic dynasty to the conquest by the Romans; the second extends from 30 BC to the destruction of the Alexandria Library sometime before or upon the capture of Alexandria by 'Amr ibn al-'As in 641 AD. The clear differences between these two periods explains the variety and vagueness of meaning attaching to the term [...] "Alexandrian School." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although {{originating}} in France, the yé-yé <b>movement</b> <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> Western Europe. The Italian singer Mina became the country's first female {{rock and roll}} singer in 1959. In the following few years, she inclined to middle-of-the-road girl pop. After her scandalous relationship and pregnancy with a married actor in 1963, she developed her image into a grown up 'bad girl'. An example of her style were the lyrics of the song [...] "Ta-ra-ta-ta": [...] "The way you smoke, you are irresistible to me, {{you look like a}} real man". By contrast, her compatriot Rita Pavone cast the image of a typical teeny yé-yé girl. For example, the lyrics of her 1964 hit [...] "Cuore" [...] complained how love made the protagonist suffer.|$|E

50|$|The Boconó Fault is {{a complex}} of {{geological}} fault located in the Eastern Ranges of northeastern Colombia and the Mérida Andes of northwestern Venezuela. The fault has a NE-SW orientation. Boconó Fault is a strike-slip fault and has a dextral relative <b>movement.</b> The fault <b>extends</b> <b>over</b> a length of 500 km. The fault, with a slip rate ranging from 4.3 to 6.1 mm per year, has been active since the Early Holocene and earthquakes of 1610 and 1894 {{are associated with the}} Boconó Fault.|$|R
40|$|Galahad is {{an ongoing}} Specific Targeted Research Project {{developed}} within the EU 6 th Framework Programme ¿ Priority 1. 1. 6. 3. The objective is to retrieve, {{through the use of}} improved GB-SAR and TLS technologies, field parameters {{that can be used in}} prediction algorithms of landslides, avalanches and glaciers related hazards. The landslide study area is located in the ski resort of Formigal, central Pyrenees (province of Huesca, Spain). The excavation of a parking area in the summer of 2004 reactivated a complex paleolandslide creating new sliding surfaces. The <b>movement</b> <b>extends</b> <b>over</b> an area of 0. 25 km 2 and experienced displacements as large as 0. 5 cm/day during the period 2004 ¿ 2005. Stabilization engineering solutions were carried out reducing maximum observed displacement to 0. 2 cm/day at the end of 2005. Within Galahad performed activities consisted in the collection of data on the landslide useful for its detailed characterization and the execution of a series of site measurement campaigns with GB-SAR, TLS and Differential GPS (D-GPS). The monitoring activities started in May 2006 completing a series of four campaigns with Total Station and D-GPS, a continuous two month data acquisition with GB-SAR and several TLS scans during two different periods from three points of view over the landslide. In this paper data obtained by GB-SAR and TLS are compared with D-GPS data, and a good agreement has been found between data sets. The project is still in progress and new site measurement campaigns with GB-SAR, TLS and D-GPS in 2007 will provide further insight into landslide forecasting models. JRC.
