2500|$|Jobs and Wozniak {{attended}} {{meetings of}} the Homebrew Computer Club in 1975. In 1976, Wozniak invented the Apple I computer {{and showed it to}} Jobs, who suggested that they sell it. Jobs, [...] Wozniak, [...] and Ronald Wayne formed Apple Computer (now called Apple Inc.) in the garage of Jobs's Los Altos home on Crist Drive. Wayne stayed only a short time, leaving Jobs and Wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the company. The two decided on the name [...] "Apple" [...] after Jobs had returned from the All One Farm commune in Oregon, where he would spend time in the farm's apple orchard. A neighbor on Crist Drive recalled Jobs as an odd individual who would greet his clients [...] "with his underwear hanging out, barefoot and hippie-like." [...] Another neighbor, Larry Waterland, who had just earned his PhD in chemical engineering at Stanford, recalled dismissing Jobs's budding business: [...] " [...] 'You punched cards, put them in a big deck,' he said about the mainframe machines of that time. 'Steve took <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the garage. He had a circuit board with a chip on it, a DuMont TV set, a Panasonic cassette tape deck and a keyboard. He said, 'This is an Apple computer.' I said, 'You've got to be joking.' I dismissed the whole idea.' [...] " [...] Jobs's friend from Reed College and India, Daniel Kottke, recalled that he [...] "was the only person who worked in the garage ... Woz would show up once a week with his latest code. Steve Jobs didn't get his hands dirty in that sense." [...] Kottke also stated that much of the early work took place in Jobs's kitchen, where he spent hours on the phone trying to find investors for the company.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} the boy. [...] "He {{looked at all}} the bodies, but did not find his; so he sent <b>me</b> <b>over</b> here <b>to</b> tell ye that p'raps he's escaped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That’ll do," [...] I ses at last, arter they ’ad walked round me ’arf-a-dozen {{times and}} patted <b>me</b> all <b>over</b> <b>to</b> see if I was dry. [...] "You get off while you’re safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|I have {{mentioned}} that my obliging friend the amoureux-fou handed <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the doorkeeper of the citadel. I should add that I {{was at first}} committed ...|$|E

6000|$|Haney was beaming. [...] "It makes <b>me</b> <b>over</b> new <b>to</b> sniff {{this air}} again," [...] he was saying. [...] "'Tis a bad plan {{to let go}} your hold on {{mountain}} air. Me lungs have contracted a trifle, but they'll expand again. I'll be riding a horse in a month." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Send in the {{application}} right away. That's partly what brought <b>me</b> <b>over.</b> I'll have <b>to</b> get you {{and two of the}} boys at Carthew to vouch for me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Bah! I am {{not afraid}} of him. He had <b>me</b> foul <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Golden Pick, but I'll be careful when next we meet. But I'll not waste time with you here, Rasco. I've got you alone and 'dead men tell no tales.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not now, dear." [...] She {{paused a}} moment, {{and then said}} deliberately: [...] "But you wouldn't mind turnin' out after sun-up and runnin' an errand for <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> The Lookout?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I must know," [...] she insisted. [...] "Have I not the right? Tell me now: Was it {{that you}} wished to see my face again before they gave <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the grave?" ...|$|E

One night we were lying at anchor, close to a dry sandbank--to this day I am not sure where it was--off the Colombian coast or thereabouts. We were to start digging the next morning, and all hands had turned in early, expecting a hard day with the shovels. Up he comes, and in his quiet, tired way of speaking--you can tell a gentleman by that as much as by {{anything}} else almost--up he comes behind me and says, just like that into my ear, in a manner: 'Well, {{what do you think of}} our treasure hunt now?' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{threw his}} arms around my neck, bent <b>me</b> <b>over</b> his stomach <b>to</b> his breast, kissed me on both cheeks, hugged me four or five times, and then placed me in his own arm-chair. As soon as I had got well again, we began {{business}} at once.|$|R
