In Aria of Sorrow, Kojima's designs followed the [...] "different route" [...] theme that producer Koji Igarashi was attempting to pursue with Aria of Sorrow by placing it in a futuristic setting. Following this theme, Alucard's appearance as Genya Arikado was made much more contemporary, featuring modern attire as versus the medieval appearance of previous Castlevania characters.

500|$|Bob Mercer {{felt that}} Bush's {{relative}} lack of success in the United States compared {{to the rest of}} the world was due to her music being a poor fit for American radio formats, and that there were no outlets for the visual presentation central to Bush's appeal. EMI capitalised on Bush's appearance by promoting the album with a poster of her in a tight pink top that emphasised her breasts. In an interview with NME magazine in 1982 Bush criticised this <b>marketing</b> <b>technique,</b> stating: [...] "People weren't even generally aware that I wrote my own songs or played the piano. The media just promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm an artist in a female body." [...] In late 1978, EMI persuaded Bush to quickly record a follow-up album, Lionheart, to take advantage of the success of The Kick Inside. Bush has often expressed dissatisfaction with Lionheart, feeling that she had needed more time to get it right. The album was produced by Andrew Powell, assisted by Bush. While it had spawned several hit singles, most notably [...] "Wow", it did not garner the same reception as her first album, reaching number six in the UK album charts.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} [...] "I'm Not Fooled By That Cheap Disguise", a 1991 essay {{deconstructing}} the Batman mythos, refer to Anarky {{as a challenge}} to Batman's social and political world view, and to the political position indirectly endorsed by the themes of a Batman adventure. As the Batman mythos is centered on themes of retribution and the protection of property rights, the invitation to readers to identify with Batman's vigilantism is an invitation to adopt political authoritarianism. The authors summarize that position as [...] "the inviolability of property relations and the justification of their defense by any means necessary (short of death)." [...] However, the authors contend that Anarky [...] "potentially redefines crime" [...] and invites the reader to identify with a new political position in favor of the disenfranchised, which Batman [...] "can not utterly condemn". The authors contend that the creation of Anarky and dialogue by other characters represented a shift towards [...] "self-conscious awareness of the Batman's hegemonic function, questioning the most central component of the Batman's identity—the nature of crime and his relation to it." [...] However, the authors remain skeptical of Anarky's commercial nature, pointing out Anarky could be [...] "incorporated as another <b>marketing</b> <b>technique</b> [...] The contradictions of capitalism would thus permit the commodification of criticisms as long as they resulted in profits." ...|$|E

2500|$|The term Green {{transport}} {{is often}} used as a greenwash <b>marketing</b> <b>technique</b> for products which are not proven to make a positive contribution to environmental sustainability. Such claims can be legally challenged. For instance Norway's consumer ombudsman has targeted automakers who claim that their cars are [...] "green", [...] "clean" [...] or [...] "environmentally friendly". Manufacturers risk fines {{if they fail to}} drop the words. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) describes green claims on products as very vague, inviting consumers to give a wide range of meanings to the claim, which risks misleading them. In 2008 the ACCC forced a car retailer to stop its green marketing of Saab cars, which was found by the Australian Federal Court as misleading.|$|E

In this case, the judge ruled that condoms could be legally advertised and sold for the prevention of disease. [...] There were still a few state laws against buying and selling contraceptives, and advertising condoms as birth control devices remained illegal in over thirty states. [...] But condoms began to be publicly, legally sold to Americans for the first time in forty-five years. [...] Through the 1920s, catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important <b>marketing</b> <b>technique</b> for many consumer items, including condoms and cigarettes. [...] Quality testing became more common, involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect loss of pressure.
