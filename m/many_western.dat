5|$|B. sceptrum {{has been}} shown to be highly {{susceptible}} to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, unlike <b>many</b> <b>Western</b> Australian banksias.|$|E
5|$|Banksia lemanniana {{has been}} shown to have a low to {{moderate}} susceptibility to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, unlike <b>many</b> <b>Western</b> Australian banksias. A study on cultivated plants in South Australia inoculated with P.cinnamomi and P.citricola found B.lemanniana to have an overall low susceptibility overall to both organisms, although 2-to-3-week-old seedlings appeared more vulnerable than 10-month-old ones.|$|E

50|$|Jack N. Young is an American stunt {{performer}} and location manager {{who worked on}} <b>many</b> <b>westerns</b> and adventure movies from 1947 to 2006.|$|R
5000|$|Hank Worden (born Norton Earl Worden July 23, 1901 [...] - [...] December 6, 1992) was an American cowboy-turned-character-actor who {{appeared}} in <b>many</b> <b>Westerns</b> including The Lone Ranger.|$|R
5|$|The Prague Spring deepened the disillusionment of <b>many</b> <b>Western</b> leftists with Soviet views. It {{contributed to}} the growth of Euro{{communist}} ideas in Western communist parties, which sought greater distance from the Soviet Union, and eventually led to the dissolution of many of these groups.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, sumo is {{considered}} Japan's national sport. Japanese martial arts such as judo, karate and kendo are also widely practiced and enjoyed by spectators in the country. After the Meiji Restoration, <b>many</b> <b>Western</b> sports {{were introduced in}} Japan and began to spread through the education system.|$|E
5|$|After the referendum, Lukashenko {{convened a}} new {{parliamentary}} assembly from those {{members of the}} parliament who were loyal to him. After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about forty deputies of the old parliament were left and the Supreme Soviet was dismissed by Lukashenko. Nevertheless, international organizations and <b>many</b> <b>Western</b> countries do not recognize the current parliament given {{the way it was}} formed. At the start of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia suspended trading in the Belarusian ruble, which led to a collapse {{in the value of the}} currency. Lukashenko responded by taking control of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, sacking the entire bank leadership and blaming the West for the free fall of the currency.|$|E
5000|$|Stephen McNally (July 29, 1911 - June 4, 1994) was an American actor remembered {{mostly for}} his {{appearances}} in <b>many</b> <b>Westerns</b> and action films. He often played hard-hearted characters or villains.|$|R
5000|$|He {{also wrote}} <b>many</b> <b>westerns</b> {{and used the}} pseudonyms Jay Lewis Bixby, D. B. Lewis, Harry Neal, Albert Russell, J. Russell, M. St. Vivant, Thornecliff Herrick and Alger Rome (for one {{collaboration}} with Algis Budrys).|$|R
50|$|He {{was active}} as a {{director}} from 1912 to 1933, making more than 130 films, most of them silent. In addition to the <b>many</b> <b>westerns</b> and adventure films to his credit, he directed the first Thai-Hollywood co-production, Miss Suwanna of Siam, in 1923.|$|R
5|$|Although {{these issues}} with {{censorship}} obscured and truncated the film {{for many years}} following its release, the film was soon recognized by <b>many</b> <b>western</b> critics and film directors as a highly original and accomplished work. Even more since being restored to its original version, Andrei Rublev {{has come to be}} {{regarded as one of the}} greatest films of all time, and has often been ranked highly in both the Sight & Sound critics' and directors' polls.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>many</b> <b>western</b> {{travelers}} {{coming into}} China {{to live and}} trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner in 1856, {{it was named}} in honour of English botanist Charles Morgan Lemann. It {{is one of three}} or four related species all with pendent inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus. No subspecies are recognised. Banksia lemanniana is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Unlike <b>many</b> <b>Western</b> Australian banksias, it appears to have some resistance to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, {{and is one of the}} easier Western Australian species to grow in cultivation.|$|E
50|$|Rod Cameron (December 7, 1910 - December 21, 1983) was a Canadian-born {{film and}} {{television}} actor whose career extended from the 1930s to the 1970s. He appeared in horror, war, action and science fiction movies, but is best remembered for his <b>many</b> <b>westerns.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1933 Webb and Bernard B. Ray created Reliable Pictures Corporation with {{a studio}} at Beachwood and Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Reliable {{produced}} and released <b>many</b> <b>Westerns,</b> starting with Girl Trouble (1933), until the company closed in 1937. Its final release was The Silver Trail.|$|R
5000|$|Joey called Jim by {{his first}} name but in time looked upon him as a father. Character actor William Fawcett played the {{housekeeper}} and top ranch hand, Pete Wilkey. [...] Fawcett was the veteran of <b>many</b> <b>westerns</b> on both television and in motion picutures.|$|R
5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and <b>many</b> <b>western</b> European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>Western</b> Catholics and non-Catholics have voiced {{disagreement}} on the Church's support for natural family planning, and contend {{it contributes to}} overpopulation and poverty. The Church's rejection of condom use is widely criticized, in particular with regard to countries where the incidence of AIDS and HIV has reached epidemic proportions. In its defense, Catholics cite countries such as Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged instead of condom use, and where greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in countries that promote condom use alone.|$|E
5|$|Policy {{interventions}} to decrease passive smoking in public {{areas such as}} restaurants and workplaces have become more common in <b>many</b> <b>Western</b> countries. Bhutan has had a complete smoking ban since 2005 while India introduced a ban on smoking in public in October 2008. The World Health Organization has called for governments to institute a total ban on tobacco advertising to prevent young people from taking up smoking. They assess that such bans have reduced tobacco consumption by 16% where instituted.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, Cameron {{appeared}} with Bonita Granville in the comedy film Strike It Rich. He then appeared in <b>many</b> <b>westerns</b> and other films for Republic Pictures including Santa Fe Passage (1955), and later The Gun Hawk (1963) , Requiem for a Gunfighter (1965) and The Bounty Killer (1965).|$|R
50|$|The film {{starts with}} a scene common to <b>many</b> <b>Westerns,</b> cowboys in a drunken state {{shooting}} up a town and wreaking havoc. The rowdies are {{from the town of}} Sabbath and are visiting the town of Bannock for a little recreation that gets out of hand.|$|R
50|$|Alexander {{was born}} in Germany. He began his Hollywood career in 1934 and {{produced}} about 50 films through 1949, <b>many</b> <b>westerns,</b> all with low budgets and with no connection to the established Hollywood studios (other {{than the fact that}} his uncle was Carl Laemmle, long-time head of Universal Pictures).|$|R
5|$|Questions about Modi's {{relationship}} with Muslims were also raised by <b>many</b> <b>Western</b> nations {{during his tenure}} as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, {{in accordance with the}} recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed {{under the aegis of the}} International Religious Freedom Act, the only person denied a US visa under this law. The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK and the EU lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil rights}} {{movement}} has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. <b>Many</b> <b>Western</b> feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights {{and the rights of}} non-white people. Despite the connections between the women's and {{civil rights movement}}s, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues. Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, classism, and sexism, and new feminisms, such as black feminism and Chicana feminism.|$|E
5|$|The gorge widens {{where the}} highway passes by Castle Valley and Professor Valley, {{which have been}} the {{shooting}} locations for <b>many</b> <b>western</b> films (including Wagon Master and Rio Grande) and television commercials. Near {{the east end of}} the valley the highway crosses Onion Creek, a stream sourced by springs that contain naturally occurring minerals that produce a strong odor in the water. At the east end of the valley the highway has a view of the Fisher Towers, a set of dark red spires. After leaving the valley, the road winds farther up the river gorge until arriving at the Dewey Bridge, named for Dewey, a nearby ghost town.|$|E
50|$|The Spahn Movie Ranch, {{once owned}} by silent film actor William S. Hart, was used to film <b>many</b> <b>westerns,</b> {{particularly}} from the 1940s to the 1960s, including Duel in the Sun, and episodes of television's Bonanza and The Lone Ranger. A western town set was located at the ranch.|$|R
5000|$|Francis Luke Askew (March 26, 1932 [...] - [...] March 29, 2012) was an American actor {{best known}} {{for his role in the}} 1969 film Easy Rider. He {{appeared}} in <b>many</b> <b>westerns,</b> and had a rare lead role in the spaghetti Western Night of the Serpent (La notte dei serpenti; 1969).|$|R
50|$|Swenson {{entered the}} film {{industry}} in 1943 with two wartime documentary shorts, December 7 and The Sikorsky Helicopter, followed by more than thirty-five roles in feature films and television movies. No Name on the Bullet (1959) {{is only one of}} the <b>many</b> <b>westerns</b> in which he performed for both film and television.|$|R
5|$|A {{version for}} PC was {{developed}} by Square's Costa Mesa offices. Square invested in a PC version so they could reach as wide a player base as possible; <b>many</b> <b>Western</b> consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled {{by a team of}} 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but including help from Tokyo. Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished. The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays. The PC version came with a license for Yamaha Corporation's software synthesizer S-YXG70, allowing high-quality sequenced music despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to XG format files was done by Yamaha.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern Europe, socialist governments fell to {{capitalist}} reformers between 1989 and 1991 and <b>many</b> <b>Western</b> observers {{expected the}} same in Cuba. Increasingly isolated, Cuba improved relations with Manuel Noriega's right-wing government in Panama – despite Castro's personal hatred of Noriega – but it was overthrown in a U.S. invasion in December 1989. In February 1990, Castro's allies in Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas, were defeated by the U.S.-funded National Opposition Union in an election. With {{the collapse of the}} Soviet bloc, the U.S. secured a majority vote for a resolution condemning Cuba's human rights violations at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. Cuba asserted that this was a manifestation of U.S. hegemony, and refused to allow an investigative delegation to enter the country.|$|E
5|$|Linda Syddick {{was one of}} <b>many</b> <b>Western</b> Desert {{women who}} took up {{painting}} in the early 1990s, {{as part of a}} broader contemporary Indigenous Australian art movement. She began painting some time prior to 1991, when her work was first exhibited in Alice Springs. Her work includes a distinctive fusion of Christian and Aboriginal traditional themes and motifs. She has been a finalist in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards on at least four occasions, and in the Blake Prize (a religious art competition) at least three times. Her works are held by numerous galleries including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Art Gallery of South Australia. Linda Syddick was the subject of a portrait painted by Robert Hannaford, which was a 1992 finalist in Australia's premiere portrait competition, the Archibald Prize.|$|E
50|$|Andrew V. McLaglen, the film's director, {{was the son}} of {{actor and}} former boxer Victor McLaglen, and went on to direct ninety-six episodes of Gunsmoke {{starring}} James Arness, as well as five movies starring John Wayne, among many others. Gun the Man Down also remains notable for being the first of <b>many</b> <b>westerns</b> McLaglen directed.|$|R
50|$|In 1956 he {{composed}} the {{score for the}} World War II drama The Sharkfighters, possibly traveling to Cuba with the film company. The score is distinctive in its use of ethnic themes featuring syncopation and percussion instruments that stress the ostinato rhythm that soon became the signature style element of his scores for <b>many</b> <b>westerns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He {{directed}} <b>many</b> <b>Westerns</b> {{during his}} career, and {{is credited with}} devising the modern system of filming movie fight sequences {{in a series of}} carefully choreographed shots, which he patterned after the musical sequences of American director Busby Berkeley. Prolific and pugnacious, Witney began directing while still in his 20s, and continued until 1982.|$|R
