These states are described using the formalism of quantum field theory, but some phenomena are difficult to explain using standard field theoretic techniques.

5|$|En route, Riker and Troi observe as Enterprise is {{contacted}} by Shran, a former Andorian Imperial Guard who Archer believed was dead. Apparently his young daughter has been kidnapped, and {{he asks for}} Archer's help in rescuing her from Rigel X. Archer decides to assist, despite Commander T'Pol's warning {{that they may be}} late returning for the ceremony. Riker joins the Enterprise crew as it assaults Shran's enemies and brings his daughter safely back. Troi also advises that Riker assume the role of ship's chef, hoping to earn the confidence of the simulated crew. As he prepares food with the crew, he learns <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> memories and impressions of Tucker.|$|E

When female {{undergraduates}} were exposed to depictions of thin women their body satisfaction decreased, but rose when exposed to larger models. In addition, many women engage in fat talk (speaking negatively about the weight-related size/shape of one's body), a behavior that {{has been associated with}} weight dissatisfaction, body surveillance, and body shame. In addition, women who overhear others using fat talk may also experience an increase in body dissatisfaction and guilt. As a result, women may experience concerns related to body image {{in a number of different}} ways and from a variety of sources.|$|E

25|$|Lazar is Goodwin's {{assistant}} and Director of the Neo Domino Security Division. He {{comes from a}} family of clowns and enjoys eating cup ramen. In the third season, he pledges allegiance to the Three Emperors of Yliaster, but later goes into hiding with his wife and son when he learns <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> plans. While generally composed, he gets rather jittery under pressure. He uses a 'Jester Deck', which focuses on sealing Synchro monsters. After his hideout is discovered by Team 5D's, he decides to cooperate with them. After Yliaster is defeated, Lazar becomes the first elected Mayor of New Domino City when a civilian government is established in the city, replacing the Public Security Maintenance Bureau.|$|E
25|$|Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS): The VIMS is {{a remote}} sensing {{instrument}} that captures images using visible and infrared light {{to learn more}} about the composition of moon surfaces, the rings, and the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan. It is made up of two cameras in one: one used to measure visible light, the other infrared. VIMS measures reflected and emitted radiation from atmospheres, rings and surfaces over wavelengths from 350 to 5100nm, to help determine their compositions, temperatures and structures. It also observes the sunlight and starlight that passes through the rings to learn <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> structure. Scientists used VIMS for long-term studies of cloud movement and morphology in the Saturn system, to determine Saturn's weather patterns.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS): The UVIS is a remote-sensing {{instrument}} that captures {{images of the}} ultraviolet light reflected off an object, such as the clouds of Saturn and/or its rings, to learn <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> structure and composition. Designed to measure ultraviolet light over wavelengths from 55.8 to 190nm, this instrument is also a tool to help determine the composition, distribution, aerosol particle content and temperatures of their atmospheres. Unlike other types of spectrometer, this sensitive instrument can take both spectral and spatial readings. It is particularly adept at determining the composition of gases. Spatial observations take a wide-by-narrow view, only one pixel tall and 64 pixels across. The spectral dimension is 1,024 pixels per spatial pixel. Also, it can take many images that create movies {{of the ways in}} which this material is moved around by other forces.|$|E

25|$|Hensel {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a study with 387 female participants {{between the ages of}} 14 and 17 and found that as the girls got older (and learned <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> sexual self-concept), they experienced less anxiety, greater comfort with sexuality and experienced more instances of sexual activity. Additionally, across the four years (from 14-17), sexual self-esteem increased, and sexual anxiety lessened. The researchers stated that this may indicate that the more sexual experiences the adolescent girls have had, the more confidence they hold in their sexual behavior and sexuality. Additionally, it may mean that for girls who have not yet had intercourse, they become more confident and ready to participate in an encounter for the first time. Researchers state that these patterns indicate that adolescent sexual behavior is not at all sporadic and impulsive, rather that it is strongly affected by the adolescent girls’ sexual self-concept and changes and expands through time.|$|E
25|$|The empire crumbled again {{amid the}} burnout of {{another of his}} creations, the 1979–80 Three's a Crowd (in which three sets of wives and {{secretaries}} competed to see who knew <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> husbands/bosses). This show provoked protests from enraged feminist and socially conservative groups (two otherwise diametrically opposed viewpoints), who charged that the show deliberately exploited adultery, to advocate it as a social norm. Most stations dropped this show months before the season was over {{as a response to}} those criticisms. At the same time, Newlywed lost the sponsorships of Ford and Procter & Gamble and earned the resentment of Jackie Autry, whose husband and business partner Gene Autry owned the show's Los Angeles outlet and production base, KTLA, because of its supposedly highly prurient content. So strong were the feelings of the Autrys that Newlywed came close to being expelled from the KTLA facilities, but the show was discontinued by the syndicator before any action occurred. Gong Show and Dating Game also ended otherwise successful syndicated runs in 1980 because of the Three's a Crowd and Newlywed controversies, likely because stations were fearful of community and advertiser retribution on account of Barris' reputation.|$|E
