25|$|In 2004 Belgium {{requested}} a reopening of the Iron Rhine railway. This {{was the result}} of the increasing transport of goods between the port of Antwerp and the German Ruhr Area. As part of the European policy of <b>modal</b> <b>shift</b> on the increasing traffic of goods, transport over railway lines and waterways was now preferred over road transport. The Belgian request was based on the treaty of 1839, and the Iron Rhine Treaty of 1873. After a series of failed negotiations, the Belgian and Dutch governments agreed to take the issue to the Permanent Court of Arbitration and respect its ruling in the case.|$|E

40|$|Mandatory {{ballast water}} management, {{resulting}} in an increase of required freight rates (RFR) on the St Lawrence Seaway, may cause <b>modal</b> <b>shifts</b> from the marine transportation mode to other modes. However, the <b>modal</b> <b>shifts</b> could well produce several undesirable side effects, such as worse air pollution, lower transportation safety, etc. To evaluate the trade-off between these and the positive ballast water management effects, a multi-attribute decision problem is formulated and solved, using the Analytic Hierarchy Process method, fuzzy set theory, and utility theory. A numerical example is presented. The results indicate that such <b>modal</b> <b>shifts</b> should be avoided, since the more the cargo is shifted from the marine mode to other modes, the more unfavourable the consequences are for the system.

40|$|This paper {{traces the}} {{historical}} evolution and spatial disparity of CO 2 emissions from passenger transport in China. The general trends of CO 2 emissions from four passenger transport modes are estimated {{by both the}} distance-based and fuel-based methods. The results suggest that CO 2 emissions from road transport represented the leading source of passenger transport CO 2 emissions in China. Moreover, they have continued to grow rapidly. Air transport was the second largest contributor since 1998. Emissions from rail and water transport have remained relatively stable with lower emission intensity. At the provincial level, great regional disparity was noticeable, especially in road transport. Moreover, the decomposition analysis shows that income growth was the principal factor leading {{to the growth of}} passenger transport CO 2 emissions in China for both the 1949 - 1979 and 1980 - 2009 periods. The second most important factor was increased transport intensity and <b>modal</b> <b>shifts</b> for the former and the latter period, respectively. The main factor contributed to emission reduction was the lower emission intensity supported by policies, although the effect was weak. In the future, more policies to encourage <b>modal</b> <b>shifts</b> toward sustainable transport modes and travel reduction should be encouraged. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|As {{an interim}} conclusion, we can {{state that the}} {{classical}} means of green logistics, which are alternative propulsion technology, alternative fuels and shifts from road to rail/IWW, cannot be implemented in the short run. Therefore, it is necessary to give clear signals to the market players that changes towards this direction will be needed to make freight transport more sustainable. However, big steps forward stemming from alternative propulsion and fuels can only be expected in the long run. <b>Modal</b> <b>shifts</b> are possible already in the short and medium run, but they can be only implemented in particular market segments such that the contribution to the reduction target should not be overrated.|$|R

Growing concern over air quality has prompted the development of strategies to reduce vehicle emissions in these areas. Concern has also been expressed regarding the current dependency of the U,S, on foreign oil. An option for addressing these concerns is to reduce vehicle-miles travelled (VMT), High- occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes have been cited as one alternative for achieving this goal. However, latent travel demand frequently negates {{some or all of the}} VMT savings brought about by HOV lanes, The net effects of <b>modal</b> <b>shifts</b> to HOV lanes and the subsequent latent travel demand were studied in the thesis, A methodology was developed for estimating vehicle emissions and energy consumption impacts of <b>modal</b> <b>shifts</b> from private vehicles in the freeway mainlanes to buses in an HOV lane when latent travel demand is considered. The methodology was evaluated and determined to yield reasonable results, Finally, the methodology was applied to a freeway corridor in Houston, Texas. The results of the application indicate that reductions in VMT do not necessarily cause reductions in vehicle emissions of interest even when considered, all three of the pollutants of latent travel demand is not consumption was decreased at considered. Energy consumption was decreased a virtually all levels of latent travel demand except where latent travel demand was equivalent to the mode shift...|$|R

30|$|If {{a general}} {{comparison}} is {{made between the}} composition costs of a road and railway vector, some asymmetries emerge. The characteristics of an infrastructure are: slow (along traditional railways, not on high speed ones, however so far rarely used for freight) and rigid for railways, as regards freight, while road transport is frequently faster, in part thanks to the far wider capillarity of the road network {{and the possibility of}} avoiding two <b>modal</b> <b>shifts.</b> The latter is also possible by rail, but only when shuttle trains from industry to industry are pursuable, in terms of quantity and availability of track links connected to the main railways (which are usually foreseen by the rail infrastructure manager for heavier traffic than 2 – 3 trains/week).|$|R
30|$|Empirical {{findings}} have documented that individuals employ {{a wide variety}} of strategies when faced with restrictions imposed by transport policies (e.g., decreased transit services, gasoline restrictions) [1 – 3], strategies that range from simple <b>modal</b> <b>shifts</b> to more complex adaptations involving trip consolidation (i.e., chaining), activity re-scheduling and destination substitution. Conventional travel demand models do not reflect (and hence predict) these complex responses, however, because of several theoretical shortcomings. In addition, estimation of the likely impacts of various activity system policies (e.g., flexitime, extended hours of service facilities) is beyond the realm of the present models, which means that separate understandings have to be built on various episodes affecting travel behaviour and made into concrete variables for the transport modelling process.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the possible extent of <b>modal</b> <b>shifts</b> from car use to 'alternative modes' (public transport, cycling, walking) without any change in individual patterns of activity. Its approach is based on a transfer procedure that allows the simulation of the maximal potential market for transport modes other than the private car. The method is based on repeated iterations of a simulation model that assigns journeys to transport modes other than the automobile based on a number of improved public transport scenarios. Demand is channelled towards individual modes (walking, cycling), public transport, and a combination of individual and public modes, based on their relative time and distance performance. The modal transfer procedure is applied to several transport supply scenarios, which provide a picture of what is possible in the sphere of modal split. Each simulation entails a potential transfer of private vehicle-km to each of the other modes. Even where different public transport scenarios are simulated, the transfer is evaluated for round trips in both the Paris and Lyon surveys. There is therefore no modification in the activity pattern of the people surveyed nor trips induced by improvements in transport supply. The aim is not to predict what would be the modal split in other circumstances, but the upper limit of the shifts. This paper presents our methodology and the principal results obtained through numerical simulations based on figures for the Paris and Lyon conurbations. This approach demonstrates that a policy focused on <b>modal</b> <b>shifts</b> has the potential to reduce car use, but that this potential is limited. Any aspiration to reduce car use further would mean changes in the patterns and location of activity...|$|R
