500|$|The {{committee}} then approached Charles Sargeant Jagger {{in early}} 1921. Jagger {{trained as a}} <b>metal</b> <b>engraver</b> before attending the Royal College of Art. He served in the infantry during the First World War and was injured at the battles of Gallipoli and Neuve-Église, being awarded the Military Cross. At {{the end of the}} war, Jagger became involved in the design of war memorials, which formed the basis of his artistic reputation. Among his works were the stark, brutal sculpture at the Hoylake and West Kirby War Memorial and the Great Western Railway War Memorial at Paddington station, though the Royal Artillery memorial is arguably his leading work. Jagger was approached by the RAWCF both because of his reputation as a designer and because of his service as an infantry officer, although the American artist John Sargent, a patron of Jagger's, may have encouraged the committee to consider the young artist. General Sir John Du Cane, a member of the RAWCF committee, encouraged his fellow members to consider Jagger {{on the grounds that the}} memorial would be the work which established Jagger's reputation and thus the sculptor would produce his best work. [...] The RAWCF requested that he submit a model for a realist sculpture, to include a group of soldiers in bronze on a pedestal. The RAWCF [...] felt that a realist design would have broader appeal and would be inclusive of the tastes of ordinary artillerymen—rather than catering solely for the tastes of the officers—while at the same time creating a historical record of the era for future generations.|$|E
6000|$|... 61. For instance, I am in {{this course}} of lectures {{to give you}} an account of a single and minor branch of graphic art,--engraving. But observe how many {{references}} to local circumstances it involves. There are three materials for it, we said;--stone, wood, and metal. Stone engraving is the art of countries possessing marble and gems; wood engraving, of countries overgrown with forest; metal engraving, of countries possessing treasures of silver and gold. And the style of a stone engraver is formed on pillars and pyramids; the style of a wood engraver under the eaves of larch cottages; the style of a <b>metal</b> <b>engraver</b> in the treasuries of kings. Do you suppose I could rightly explain to you the value of a single touch on brass by Finiguerra, or on box by Bewick, unless I had grasp of the great laws of climate and country; and could trace the inherited sirocco or tramontana of thought to which the souls and bodies of the men owed their existence? ...|$|E

60|$|In <b>metal</b> <b>{{engraving}},</b> it {{is easier}} to lay a fine line than a thick one; and however fine the line may be, it lasts;--but in wood engraving it requires extreme precision and skill to leave a thin dark line, and when left, it will be quickly beaten down by a careless printer. Therefore, the virtue of wood engraving is to exhibit the qualities and power of thick lines; and of <b>metal</b> <b>engraving,</b> to exhibit the qualities and power of thin ones.|$|R

Juengling's reproductions of Kelly's illustrations in Scribner's Monthly (1877) is regarded by Weitenkampf as making [...] "the first obvious, continued assertion of the new point of view." ...|$|E

50|$|Shading {{is used in}} the {{greatest}} moderation with thin straight strokes that never overpower the stronger organic lines of the design. In early <b>metal</b> <b>engraving</b> the shading lines are often cross-hatched. In the earliest woodcuts they are not. The reason being that when lines are incised, they may as easily be crossed, as not. Whereas when they are reserved, the crossing involves much non-artistic labor.|$|R
60|$|You {{probably}} {{already know the}} difference between the actual methods of producing a printed impression from wood and metal; but I may perhaps make the matter a little more clear. In <b>metal</b> <b>engraving,</b> you cut ditches, fill them with ink, and press your paper into them. In wood engraving, you leave ridges, rub the tops of them with ink, and stamp them on your paper.|$|R

50|$|The {{characteristics}} of early <b>metal</b> <b>engraving</b> in Germany are {{demonstrated in the}} works of Martin Schongauer (d. 1488) and Albrecht Dürer (d. 1528). Schongauer used outline and shade as a unified element, and the shading, generally in curved lines. His skill is far more masterly than the straight shading of Mantegna. Dürer continued Schongauer's curved shading, with increasing manual delicacy and skill, and over-loaded his plates with quantities of living and inanimate objects. He applied the same intensity of study to every art form he explored.|$|R
