25|$|Internet service {{providers}} establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks {{at various levels}} of scope. End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent {{the bottom of the}} routing hierarchy. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the tier 1 networks, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via peering agreements. Tier 2 and lower level networks buy Internet transit from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement <b>multihoming</b> to achieve redundancy and load balancing. Internet exchange points are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as GEANT, GLORIAD, Internet2, and the UK's national research and education network, JANET. Both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of scale-free networks. Computers and routers use routing tables in their operating system to direct IP packets to the next-hop router or destination. Routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or automatically by routing protocols. End-nodes typically use a default route that points toward an ISP providing transit, while ISP routers use the Border Gateway Protocol to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global Internet.|$|E
2500|$|When two-sided markets {{contain more}} than one {{competing}} platform, the condition of users affiliating with {{more than one}} such platform is called <b>multihoming.</b> Instances arise, for example, when consumers carry credit cards from more than one banking network or they continue using computers based on two different operating systems. This condition implies an increase of [...] "homing" [...] costs, which comprise all the expenses network users incur in order to establish and maintain platform affiliation. These ongoing costs of platform affiliation should be distinguished from switching costs, which refer to the one time costs of terminating one network and adopting another.|$|E

50|$|Classical <b>multihoming</b> is the {{dominant}} technique for IPv4. This requires that a network have its own public IP address range and a public Autonomous System (AS) number.|$|E
50|$|Network load {{balancing}} (commonly {{referred to as}} dual-WAN routing or <b>multihoming)</b> {{is the ability to}} balance traffic across two WAN links without using complex routing protocols like BGP.|$|E
50|$|<b>Multihoming</b> is the {{practice}} of connecting a host or a computer network {{to more than one}} network. This can be done in order to increase reliability or performance, or to reduce cost.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Multihoming</b> with {{multiple}} addresses has been implemented for IPv6. [...] For outgoing traffic, this requires {{support on the}} host, either protocol agnostic (Multipath TCP, SCTP, etc.) or specific to IPv6 (e.g. SHIM6).|$|E
5000|$|Support of the RFC 4555 Mobility and <b>Multihoming</b> Protocol (MOBIKE) {{which allows}} dynamic {{changes of the}} IP address and/or network {{interface}} without IKEv2 rekeying. MOBIKE is also supported by the Windows 7 Agile VPN Client.|$|E

50|$|Classical <b>multihoming</b> is costly, {{since it}} {{requires}} the use of address space that is accepted by all providers, a public Autonomous System (AS) number, and a dynamic routing protocol. Since multihomed address space cannot be aggregated, it causes growth of the global routing table.|$|E
50|$|IPAM {{tools are}} {{increasingly}} important as new IPv6 networks are deployed with larger address pools, different subnetting techniques {{and more complex}} 128-bit hexadecimal numbers, which are not as easily human-readable as IPv4 addresses. IPv6 networking, mobile computing, and <b>multihoming</b> require more dynamic address management.|$|E
50|$|Communications in {{data centers}} today {{are most often}} based on {{networks}} running the IP protocol suite. Data centers contain a set of routers and switches that transport traffic between the servers and to the outside world. Redundancy of the Internet connection is often provided by using two or more upstream service providers (see <b>Multihoming).</b>|$|E
50|$|Reliability {{was also}} {{a key part of}} the {{security}} design of SCTP. <b>Multihoming</b> enables an association to stay open even when some routes and interfaces are down. This is of particular importance for SIGTRAN as it carries SS7 over an IP network using SCTP, and requires strong resilience during link outages to maintain telecommunication service even when enduring network anomalies.|$|E
50|$|Source-specific routing, {{also called}} source-address {{dependent}} routing (SADR), is a routing technique {{in which a}} routing decision is made {{by looking at the}} source address of a packet in addition to its destination address. The main application of source-specific routing is to allow a cheap form of <b>multihoming</b> without the need for provider-independent addresses or any cooperation from upstream ISPs.|$|E
50|$|BGP4 is {{standard}} for Internet routing, required of most Internet service providers (ISPs) to establish routing between one another. Very large private IP networks use BGP internally. An {{example is the}} joining {{of a number of}} large Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) networks, when OSPF by itself does not scale to the size required. Another reason to use BGP is <b>multihoming</b> a network for better redundancy, either to multiple access points of a single ISP or to multiple ISPs.|$|E
50|$|In {{classical}} <b>multihoming,</b> {{a network}} {{is connected to}} multiple providers, and uses its own range of addresses (typically from a Provider Independent (PI) range). The network's edge routers communicate with the providers using a dynamic routing protocol, typically BGP, which announces the network's address range to all providers. If one of the links fail, the dynamic routing protocol recognises the failure within seconds or minutes, and reconfigures its routing tables to use the remaining links, transparently to the hosts.|$|E
