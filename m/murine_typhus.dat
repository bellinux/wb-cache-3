The vast variability and non-specific presentation of this infection have often made it difficult to diagnose clinically.

40|$|Abstract. Blood–brain barrier (BBB) {{function}} and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers were measured in patients admitted to hospital with severe neurological infections in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (N = 66), including bacterial meningitis (BM; N = 9) or tuberculosis meningitis (TBM; N = 11), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV; N = 25), and rickettsial infections (N = 21) including <b>murine</b> and scrub <b>typhus</b> patients. The albumin index (AI) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels {{were significantly higher}} in BM and TBM than other diseases but were also raised in individual rickettsial patients. Total tau protein was significantly raised in the CSF of JEV patients. No {{differences were found between}} clinical or neurological symptoms, AI, or biomarker levels that allowed distinction between severe neurological involvement by Orientia tsutsugamushi compared with Rickettsia species. Central nervous system (CNS) infections are caused by a range of different pathogens and a major cause of mor-bidity and mortality worldwide. 1, 2 Orientia tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp. infections have recently been identified as a major cause of CNS disease in Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Laos) in a large prospective study 3 where 9 % of al...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} strains of typhus virus are {{observed}} in Mexico: first the murine type which is obtained from wild rats in nature, from isolated endemic cases, and from cases during short epidemic outbreaks, and second, the epidemic type of strains which is obtained from long standing serious epidemics. Some of these epidemic strains correspond entirely to strains of historic Old World typhus. Other strains which in their experimental behavior are intermediate {{between these two}} types of strains were isolated from the same epidemic. A method is described by which these epidemic non-orchitic strains can be converted into murine strains regularly causing scrotal lesion in guinea pigs and a highly fatal disease in rats. The same results were obtained with an Old World strain of epidemic typhus. The method, which consists of daily blood injections into intraperitoneally inoculated rats, is based on the observation that Rickettsia prowazeki multiplies only within cells which come in constant or frequent contact with fresh blood. It is concluded from our experiments that there does not exist any real difference between the virus of historic Old World <b>typhus</b> and the <b>murine</b> New World <b>typhus.</b> Both are considered to be of murine origin.

40|$|Surface {{proteins}} of the obligate intracellular bacterium Rickettsia typhi, {{the agent}} of <b>murine</b> or endemic <b>typhus</b> fever, comprise an important interface for host-pathogen interactions including adherence, invasion and survival in the host cytoplasm. In this report, we present analyses of the surface exposed proteins of R. typhi based on a suite of predictive algorithms complemented by experimental surface-labeling with thiol-cleavable sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and identification of labeled peptides by LC MS/MS. Further, we focus on proteins belonging to the surface cell antigen (Sca) autotransporter (AT) family which {{are known to be}} involved in rickettsial infection of mammalian cells. Each species of Rickettsia has a different complement of sca genes in various states; R. typhi, has genes sca 1 thru sca 5. In silico analyses indicate divergence of the Sca paralogs across the four Rickettsia groups and concur with previous evidence of positive selection. Transcripts for each sca were detected during infection of L 929 cells and four of the five Sca proteins were detected in the surface proteome analysis. We observed that each R. typhi Sca protein is expressed during in vitro infections and selected Sca proteins were expressed during in vivo infections. Using biotin-affinity pull down assays, negative staining electron microscopy, and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that the Sca proteins in R. typhi are localized {{to the surface of the}} bacteria. All Scas were detected during infection of L 929 cells by immunogold electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence assays demonstrate that Scas 1 - 3 and 5 are expressed in the spleens of infected Sprague-Dawley rats and Scas 3, 4 and 5 are expressed in cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis). Sca proteins may be crucial in the recognition and invasion of different host cell types. In short, continuous expression of all Scas may ensure that rickettsiae are primed i) to infect mammalian cells should the flea bite a host, ii) to remain infectious when extracellular and iii) to infect the flea midgut when ingested with a blood meal. Each Sca protein may be important for survival of R. typhi and the lack of host restricted expression may indicate a strategy of preparedness for infection of a new host...|$|R
