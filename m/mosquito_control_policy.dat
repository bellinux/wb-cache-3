40|$|The {{proposed}} {{release of}} genetically modified mosquitoes (GMM) in the Florida Keys to combat the spread of diseases such as Zika prompted heated local debate, turning a seemingly routine <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> <b>policy</b> into a public scientific controversy. Arguments about the GMM derive from inventional commonplaces where the historical conflict between democratic systems of civic deliberation and the epistemic authority of expertise is instantiated. This project analyzes the topoi that Keys participants gather around to generate their argumentative positions as published in public, local print and digital news articles, blog posts, and {{letters to the editor}} between 2011 and 2016. Investigating the commonplaces that orient the argumentative trajectories of Keys participants reveals that each relational topos intersects with individual worldviews, risk assessments, and standards and can therefore be used for contradictory arguments. The many complex and connected factors that influence participant positions must be appreciated and acknowledged in any such civic deliberation about a science-related policy or technology. There is no easy resolution for such conflicts, such as clarifying scientific data for the public, to generate consensus; the irresolvable tension between democracy and expertise underlies public scientific controversies and requires mutual respect and appreciation for the varied reasons why people disagree to move towards more productive civic discourse...|$|E
40|$|Malaria {{and human}} {{prosperity}} had been intimately connected {{since the beginning}} of human civilization through agriculture, and today most of its burden is concentrated in poor and rural communities. While this connection has been recognized, the contribution of agricultural development on the distribution and abundance of malaria, and the influence of the feedback that can operate between the disease and the agrarian economy, remains poorly understood. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the role of irrigation and agricultural development in determining the distribution, abundance, and dynamics of malaria populations and simultaneously the role of malaria on human behavior related to <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> <b>policy</b> and economic productivity. This dissertation examines the current malaria situation in the semi-desert and monsoon-driven region of Northwest India and, retrospectively, malaria elimination in Mississippi, United States. This work shows that in highly irrigated areas malaria predictability based on rainfall is reduced due to intense vector control programs, most successfully implemented by authorities in more prosperous and irrigated places. I show that this vector control strategy generates a mechanistic feedback between the disease and the control itself, which decreases the effectiveness of the intervention and the likelihood of elimination. In addition, I provide evidence suggesting that this period of high risk and high control in irrigated settings is a transient period, lasting {{for more than a decade}} when poor areas with low irrigation development transition to becoming areas with sustainable low risk and better socioeconomic conditions. Finally, I provide evidence to suggest that income and other economic factors had a large influence in driving malaria interannual variability and its elimination in Mississippi. The influence of malaria on cotton production, which dominated the economy of the region at this time, was limited. Together, the results from this dissertation provide insight to support the idea that including socioeconomic factors, while indirectly related to malaria transmission, with detailed ecological knowledge of the malaria system can provide valuable information to generate more sustainable and effective strategies to decrease malaria burden and eventually eradicate the disease...|$|E

40|$|Background: As the arboviral {{diseases}} dengue, chikungunya and Zika {{emerge in}} the Americas, so does the need for sustainable vector <b>control</b> <b>policies.</b> To successfully achieve <b>mosquito</b> <b>control,</b> joint efforts of both communities and governments are essential. This study investigates this important, but by-and-large neglected topic. Methods: In June and July 2015, a cross-sectional mixed methods study applying a survey questionnaire (response rate of 82. 5 %; n = 339), in-depth interviews (n = 20) and focus group discussions (n = 7; 50 participants) was performed in Curacao. The study was designed based on an integrated theoretical framework of the Health Belief Model and the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Results: Participants showed a good knowledge of, and a high-level performance of <b>mosquito</b> breeding site <b>control</b> (MBSC) practices. Personal protection against mosquitoes (e. g. topical repellents) was perceived as relatively less effective thus practiced to lower extent compared to MBSC practices (i. e. larval source management). A lower intention to perform MBSC was independently associated with: (i) satisfaction on governmental MBSC (P = 0. 012); (ii) barriers to perform MBSC practices, i. e. Government doesn't control other breeding sites' (P = 0. 005), 'Don't know how to control breeding sites' (P = 0. 041), and 'a mosquito does not transmit dengue' (P = 0. 016), (iii) attitudes towards MBSC (P = 0. 001) and self-efficacy (person's perceived ability to act) to perform MBSC (P = 0. 002). Mixed-methods evidence highlights three possible ways of improving community participation in MBSC. First, it highlights the need for ongoing media coverage, targeting (i) communities' perceptions on transmission routes of dengue and chikungunya, and (ii) presence of car tires in yards. Secondly, it shows that promotion of governmental activities in MBSC can enhance MBSC of communities, if people {{develop a sense of}} responsibility to perform MBSC at their own properties. Thirdly, this study describes the presence of key persons in communities, who could be engaged in <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> to improve MBSC in neighbourhoods. Conclusion: This study reveals gaps between policy and communities' lived realities. These gaps might be overcome with the proposed interventions, resulting in a higher performance of MBSC in the community in Curacao. Furthermore, this study shows how interdisciplinary mixed methods research can provide important, comprehensive, and in-depth insights to inform <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> policie...|$|R

40|$|In 2013 and 2014 routine {{surveillance}} for invasive mosquito {{species was}} implemented in Belgium at 13 potential points of entry. Following {{the introduction of}} Aedes (Stegomia) albopictus (Skuse, 1895) to Belgium via a used tyre import company (Vrasene, Province of East Flanders) in July 2013 one female and 17 larvae were collected outdoors {{during a period of}} intensive surveillance in summer and autumn 2013, but no control measures were implemented. Although climatic conditions were suitable during the winter of 2013 - 2014, this reproducing population did not overwinter. Lack of genetic variation, incomplete diapause adaptation and egg desiccation due to long dry periods during diapause, or competition with endemic species are possible reasons. More studies on the diapause/longevity of Ae. albopictus eggs in northern temperate climatic conditions and on the competition with endemic species in western and central Europe are warranted to assess the potential for this invasive mosquito to overwinter. Furthermore, following the detection of four Ae. albopictus larvae in a shipment of lucky bamboo at the port of Antwerp in August 2014, one female, one male, 11 pupae and six larvae were collected at the destined lucky bamboo company (Lochristi, Province of East Flanders) in autumn 2014. In this case, immediate control measures were successfully implemented at the nursery. Because of increasing threats and the absence of an invasive <b>mosquito</b> species <b>control</b> <b>policy</b> in Belgium, the need for a permanent vector surveillance and control plan has never been so high.

The study developed a typology of <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> programs, based on the approaches used. Based on the analysis of data on RRV disease rates between <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> types within 4 climatic regions, each region had different combinations of <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> strategies in their programs; there were also general similarities in the relationship between program types and RRV rates between the regions. The long-term RRV disease rates were lower in areas where the <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> program included pre-emptive (rather than reactive) surveillance based on an extensive (rather than incomplete) knowledge of mosquito habitats, and where treatment of both saltwater and freshwater habitats (compared to only saltwater habitats, in coastal areas) occurred.

40|$|Natural {{disasters}} such as hurricanes {{may cause}} increases in mosquito abundance and, consequently, arbovirus transmission risk. In 2011, flooding from Hurricane Irene in eastern North Carolina (NC) resulted in increased mosquito populations that hindered recovery efforts. Budget shortfalls in NC {{have reduced the}} functionality of long-term <b>mosquito</b> surveillance and <b>control</b> programs; hence, many counties rely on the Federal Emergency Management Agency for post-disaster <b>mosquito</b> <b>control.</b> This pilot study examines mosquito abundance pre- and post-aerial insecticide spraying at eight study sites in Washington and Tyrrell Counties in rural eastern NC after Hurricane Irene. Traps in spray zones show decreases in mosquito abundance following aerial pesticide application compared to control traps, although no significant differences (p > 0. 05) were observed. Implications of reactive rather than proactive <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> responses are discussed. The absence of state <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> funding left some emergency managers (EMs) with the added burden of <b>mosquito</b> <b>control,</b> including coordination, implementation, and reimbursement for control activities.

40|$|<b>Mosquito</b> <b>control</b> is an {{important}} and basic public health function. The rapid spread of West Nile virus across the U. S. {{in the last five}} years demonstrates the continuing need for organized <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> activities. States and local communities are challenged to develop and maintain these essential vector control programs, especially in tight budgetary times and when emergency situations have quieted. In response to needs voiced by the public and impacted communities, as well as the public health and <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> communities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases sponsored ASTHO to develop a set of recommendations for creating sustainable state and local <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> programs. Because <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> involves many players, ASTHO convened the <b>Mosquito</b> <b>Control</b> Collaborative (MCC or the Collaborative), a body comprised of state, local, and federal representatives from public health, environmental, and agricultural agencies, as well as other organizations intimately involved with vector control and public health. Because <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> efforts begin at the community level, ASTHO invited the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) to join the project as a partner. The following document consists of the recommendations developed by the MCC from February through December 2004. The purpose of this document is to serve as a catalyst for discussion and as a working document for public health practitioners and policy makers.
