5|$|In the Crystal City, Virginia {{headquarters}} of the software company Eurisko, founder Brad Wilczek {{and chief executive officer}} Benjamin Drake argue about downsizing measures. After Wilczek leaves, Drake writes a memo proposing to shut down the Central Operating System, a computer which runs the Eurisko Building. Seeing this through a surveillance camera, the COS sets up a trap and lures Drake into a bathroom, locking the door behind him. Drake tries to use his keycard to open it, but it rejects the card. When he inserts a <b>manual</b> <b>override</b> key, he is fatally electrocuted.|$|E
5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated {{there was a real}} concern. In response, the areas of the horizontal stabilizer were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a <b>manual</b> <b>override</b> switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E
5|$|The lens {{features}} a hypersonic zoom motor for its autofocus, {{which is considered}} to be a fast and quiet design. In addition, <b>manual</b> <b>override</b> is allowed in the single-shot autofocus mode. The lens, which focuses internally, has one of the lowest maximum magnification measurements in its class (which includes the Canon 10–18mm and 10–22mm, Sigma 10–20mm f/3.5 and Sigma 10–20mm f/4–5.6 EX DC HSM, Tamron 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5 DI II, Nikon 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5G ED AF-S DX, and Tokina 11–16mm f/2.8 AT-X Pro DX lenses). The lens' autofocus feature is not functional with Pentax ist* series and K100D DSLR cameras that do not support hypersonic zoom mechanics. The lens is capable of focusing from infinity to minimum focusing distance and back in under a second: so micro focusing is rapid. However, because of the narrow focus range (0.13x) the lens is not suitable for macro photography.|$|E
25|$|Control data {{comes from}} two locations: Metrol, and control stations. Next train data and times are {{automatically}} updated by the train control systems, with <b>manual</b> <b>overrides</b> also possible.|$|R
30|$|It {{is likely}} that the ship’s {{concepts}} of operation (CONOPS) will always include a much larger percentage of <b>manual</b> <b>overrides</b> than in terrestrial systems, which will have to be reflected in the control strategy.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigation}} report resulted in improved fire-proofing of all such carriages {{and the provision}} of through-corridors between carriages. Although the electrically-operated doors had <b>manual</b> <b>overrides</b> positioned under the passenger seats, this was poorly signed. The report resulted in their being marked with red signage.|$|R
25|$|If the paddle-shift {{activated}} <b>manual</b> <b>override</b> {{of one of}} {{the automatic}} modes (D or S) is used intermittently the DSG transmission will default back to the previously selected automatic mode after a predetermined duration of inactivity of the paddles, or when the vehicle becomes stationary. Alternatively, should the driver wish to immediately revert to fully automatic control, this can be done by activating and holding the + paddle for at least two seconds.|$|E
25|$|Some {{flushometer}} models {{require the}} user to either depress a lever or press a button, which in turn opens a flush valve allowing mains-pressure water to flow directly into the toilet bowl or urinal. Other flushometer models are electronically triggered, using an infrared sensor to initiate the flushing process. Typically, on electronically triggered models, an override button is provided in case the user wishes to manually trigger flushing earlier. Some electronically triggered models also incorporate a true mechanical <b>manual</b> <b>override</b> {{which can be used}} in the event of the failure of the electronic system. In retrofit installations, a self-contained battery-powered or hard-wired unit can be added to an existing manual flushometer to flush automatically when a user departs.|$|E
25|$|The {{ejection}} seat was the Raketstol 37 (literally; Rocket chair 37) {{and was the}} last Saab designed seat in service. A derivative of the Saab 105 trainer seat, the seat was optimized for low altitude, high speed ejections. Once activated by the pilot via triggers built into the armrests (on twin-seat models, the occupant of the forward cockpit position is able to initiate the ejection of both seats), the ejection sequence is automated, including {{the removal of the}} canopy; {{in the event of a}} malfunction, a reserve trigger can be activated. A combined parachute and seat harness is used, which features a barometric interlock to appropriately release the occupant and harness from the seat during the ejection sequence, a <b>manual</b> <b>override</b> handle is also provided for this function.|$|E
50|$|In {{technical}} writing where a single source may {{be published in}} multiple formats, and now in HTML5 with the expectation of viewing content at different sizes or resolutions, use the word processor settings that automatically prevent widows and orphans. <b>Manual</b> <b>overrides</b> like inserted empty lines or extra spaces can cause unexpected white space {{in the middle of}} pages.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>manual</b> <b>overrides</b> {{can be used}} to veto an {{automated}} system's judgment when the system is in error. An example of this is a printer's ink level detection: in one case, a researcher found that when he overrode the system, up to 38% more pages could be printed at good quality by the printer than the automated system would have allowed.|$|R
50|$|AVS verifies the numeric {{portions}} of a cardholder's billing address. For example, if {{the address is}} 101 Main Street, Highland, CA 92346, in the United States, AVS will check 101 and 92346. Cardholders may receive false negatives, or partial declines for AVS from e-commerce verification systems, which may require <b>manual</b> <b>overrides,</b> voice authorization, or reprogramming of the AVS entries by the card issuing bank.|$|R
2500|$|Instead of a {{one-shot}} temporary installation, the hackers have {{designed and built}} a permanent facility that can be re-used repeatedly by the MIT community. An understanding has been reached with the EAPS Department, which is headquartered in the Green Building, to allow the light display hardware to remain installed in each window. [...] To avoid annoying the occupants and to allow late-working staff to [...] "opt out", each light display {{is equipped with a}} <b>manual</b> <b>override</b> button, which will disable the pixel lighting for that window for several hours after it is pressed. In addition, the hackers have released Open Source software tools used to develop new display patterns, so that others can design and deploy new stationary or animated images, in cooperation with the hacker engineers.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to {{the earlier}} Bf 109 E, the Bf 109 F was much {{improved}} aerodynamically. The engine cowling was redesigned to be smoother and more rounded. The enlarged propeller spinner, adapted {{from that of the}} new Messerschmitt Me 210, now blended smoothly into the new engine cowling. Underneath the cowling was a revised, more streamlined oil cooler radiator and fairing. A new ejector exhaust arrangement was incorporated, and on later aircraft a metal shield was fitted over the left hand banks to deflect exhaust fumes away from the supercharger air-intake. The supercharger air-intake was, from the F-1 -series onwards, a rounded, [...] "elbow"-shaped design that protruded further out into the airstream. A new three-blade, light-alloy VDM propeller unit with a reduced diameter of 3m (9ft 8.5in) was used. Propeller pitch was changed electrically, and was regulated by a constant-speed unit, though a <b>manual</b> <b>override</b> was still provided. Thanks to the improved aerodynamics, more fuel-efficient engines and the introduction of light-alloy versions of the standard Luftwaffe 300 litre drop tank, the Bf 109 F offered a much increased maximum range of 1,700km (1,060mi) compared to the Bf 109 E's maximum range figure of only 660km (410 miles) on internal fuel, and with the E-7's provision for the 300 litre drop tank, a Bf 109E so equipped possessed double the range, to 1,325km (820mi).|$|E

The main turbine sets could achieve {{a load of}} 10 MW from the pressing of a button within 2 minutes and 40 seconds. From the stabilizing load of 10 MW, the full capacity of 55 MW could be achieved {{in a matter of}} seconds.|$|R

50|$|Automated {{systems are}} {{becoming}} increasingly common and integrated into everyday objects such as automobiles and domestic appliances. This development of ubiquitous computing raises general issues of policy and law {{about the need for}} <b>manual</b> <b>overrides</b> for matters of great importance such as life-threatening situations and major economic decisions. The loyalty of such autonomous devices then becomes an issue. If they follow rules installed by the manufacturer or required by law and refuse to cede control in some situations then the owners of the devices may feel disempowered, alienated and lacking true ownership.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore human-computer {{interaction}} for carving, building upon our previous work with the FreeD digital sculpting device. We contribute a new tool design (FreeD V 2), with a novel set of interaction techniques for the fabrication of static models: personalized toolpaths, <b>manual</b> <b>overriding,</b> and physical merging of virtual models. We also present techniques for fabricating dynamic models, which may be altered directly or parametrically during fabrication. We demonstrate a semi-autonomous operation and evaluate {{the performance of the}} tool. We end by discussing synergistic cooperation between human and machine to ensure accuracy while preserving the expressiveness of manual practice...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. Reliable {{manufacture}} depends among other aspects {{on the supply}} of correct parts to the different manufacturing processes. In this paper a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system used for material handling in harsh environments is presented. The system enforces business rules to guarantee that only correct parts are supplied to the assembly line also registering unexpected <b>manual</b> <b>overrides</b> of the system (e. g. Operator manually retracting the solenoid {{at the entrance of}} the lane at the assembly station). Resulting benefits allowed include an ergonomically smoother loading operation and a reduction in misbuild levels in a flexible manufacturing environment...|$|R

40|$|The Flight Support System (FSS) which {{contains}} twelve mechanisms (six different types) {{which are used}} for retention and positioning of a Multimission Modular Spacecraft (MMS) within the Space Shuttle's cargo bay during launch, retrieval, and servicing missions is described. Retention latches were designed to provide the capability for structural support of the MMS during launch and retrieval, and during servicing operations the mechanisms on the Positioning Platform provide the capability for positioning the MMS in virtually any orientation necessary for the work to be performed. In addition, there are mechanisms for matching and demating umbilical connectors and a mechanism for locking the Positioning Platform during maneuvers. Each Mechanism is driven by a Common Drive Unit. <b>Manual</b> <b>overrides</b> were provided for those mechanisms that would present a safety hazard for the crew, if they should fail...|$|R
40|$|The Shuttle Orbiter {{communications}} equipment includes phase modulation (PM) and frequency modulation (FM) channels. The PM section has {{the capability of}} routing high levels of energy (175 W) from any one of four transmitters {{to any one of}} four antennas, mutually exclusive. The FM channel uses a maximum of 15 -W power routed from either of two transmitters to one of two antennas, mutually exclusive. The paper describes the design and the theory of a logic-controlled RF switch matrix devised for the purposes cited. Both PM and FM channels are computer-controlled with <b>manual</b> <b>overrides.</b> The logic interface is realized with CMOS logic for low power consumption and high noise immunity. The interior of the switch matrix is maintained at a pressure of 15 psi (90 % nitrogen, 10 % helium) by an electron beam-welded encapsulation. The computational results confirm the viability of the RF switch matrix concept...|$|R
50|$|According to Boeing-published flight {{procedure}}s, A/T {{is engaged}} BEFORE the takeoff procedure and is automatically disconnected two seconds after landing. During flight, <b>manual</b> <b>override</b> of A/T is always available. A release of <b>manual</b> <b>override</b> allows A/T to regain control, and the throttle {{will go back}} to the A/T commanded position except for two modes (Boeing type aircraft): IDLE and THR HLD. In these two modes, the throttle will remain at the manual commanded position.|$|E
50|$|Another type is the roll-up or rolling shutter, {{consisting}} {{of a series of}} slats that form a curtain with both sides of the curtain being inserted into guide rails. The curtain is then rolled onto an axle which is covered by a housing. Rolling shutters can be operated manually by gear, by pull strap or can be motorized independently or in conjunction with a <b>manual</b> <b>override.</b> Motorized shutters can be operated by either a switch or remote and can be controlled either individually or in groups. On loss of power caused by hurricanes, motorized shutters must be operated manually, requiring either access to the motor (which can be difficult) or a pre-installed <b>manual</b> <b>override.</b> Most often, a <b>manual</b> <b>override</b> is operated using a gear. When deployed, all hurricane shutters require special techniques for firefighters {{to gain access to the}} interior of a structure.|$|E

40|$|ESRI is {{developing}} its GIS software to support cartographic representations inside a versioned geodatabase. Representations are usually {{described as a}} Digital Cartographic Model (DCM), {{as opposed to a}} Digital Landscape Model (DLM). A set of tools (including generalization operators) is involved in deriving the DCM from the DLM. One of the main benefits of the DCM representation mechanism is to support <b>manual</b> <b>overrides,</b> because there will always need to be human interventions. Thus, real cartographic data require a combination of automated and human work. This paper covers the propagation of DLM updates to the DCM features and representations. The first challenge is to apply the same set of derivation rules using just update descriptions as input, instead of a whole new dataset. The second challenge is to prevent erasing the manual work of the cartographer, which represents much of the time spent to produce the final map. The paper describes how the database model is extended {{to keep track of the}} cartographers manual work. ...|$|R
