25|$|Two {{holes at}} the bottom left and right {{indicate}} whether the disk is write-protected and whether it is high-density; these holes are spaced as far apart as the holes in punched A4 paper, allowing write-protected high-density floppies to be clipped into standard ring binders. A notch at top right ensures that the disk is in the correct orientation and an arrow at top left indicating direction of insertion. The drive usually has a button that when pressed ejects the disk {{with varying degrees of}} force, the discrepancy due to the ejection force provided by the spring of the shutter. In IBM PC compatibles, Commodores, Apple II/IIIs, and other non-Apple-Macintosh machines with standard floppy disk drives, a disk may be ejected manually at any time. The drive has a disk-change switch that detects when a disk is ejected or inserted. Failure of this <b>mechanical</b> <b>switch</b> is a common source of disk corruption if a disk is changed and the drive (and hence the operating system) fails to notice.|$|E
2500|$|A small notch disk {{identifies}} {{that it is}} writable, {{detected by}} a <b>mechanical</b> <b>switch</b> or phototransistor above it; {{if it is not}} present, the disk can be written; in the 8-inch disk the notch is covered to enable writing while in the 5¼-inch disk the notch is open to enable writing. Tape may be used over the notch to change the mode of the disk. [...] Punch devices were sold to convert read-only disks to writable ones and enable writing on the unused side of single sided disks; such modified disks became known as flippy disks.|$|E

While in the box, the cat is described as being in a quantum superposition of [...] "dead" [...] and [...] "alive" [...] states, though opening the box effectively collapses the cat's wave function {{to one of the}} two conditions. In the case of the EPR paradox, quantum entanglement appears to allow for the physical impossibility of information transmitted faster than the speed of light, violating special relativity. Related to the EPR paradox is the phenomenon of quantum pseudo-telepathy in which parties who are prevented from communicating do manage to accomplish tasks that seem to require direct contact.|$|E
40|$|MEMS based <b>mechanical</b> <b>switches</b> {{are seen}} to be the likely {{replacements}} for CMOS based switches due to the several advantages that these <b>mechanical</b> <b>switches</b> have over CMOS <b>switches.</b> <b>Mechanical</b> <b>switches</b> {{can be used in}} systems under extreme conditions and also provide more reliability and cause less power loss. A major problem with <b>mechanical</b> <b>switches</b> is bouncing. Bouncing is an undesirable characteristic which increases the switching time and causes damage to the switch structure affecting the overall switch life. This thesis proposes a new switch design that may be used to mitigate bouncing by using two voltage sources using a double electrode configuration. The effect of many switch’s tunable parameters is also discussed and an effective tuning technique is also provided. The results are compared to the current control schemes in literature and show that the double electrode scheme is a viable control option...|$|R

50|$|Initially, all {{switches}} {{are closed}} (on). Because the high-voltage semiconductor switch has much greater resistance than the <b>mechanical</b> <b>switch</b> plus the low-voltage semiconductor switch, current flow through it is low. To disconnect, first the low-voltage semiconductor switch opens. This diverts the current through the high-voltage semiconductor switch. Because of its relatively high resistance, it begins heating very rapidly. Then the high-speed <b>mechanical</b> <b>switch</b> is opened. Unlike the low-voltage semiconductor switch, which {{is capable of}} standing off only the {{voltage drop of the}} closed high-voltage semiconductor switch, this one is capable of standing off the full voltage. Because no current is flowing through this switch when it opens, it is not damaged by arcing. Then, the high-voltage semiconductor switch is opened. This actually cuts the power. However, it is not quite 100% off. A final low-speed <b>mechanical</b> <b>switch</b> disconnects the residual current.|$|E

40|$|International audienceEnergy {{harvesting}} {{is considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising solution for the power supply of autonomous sensor systems. Two main properties are required: self-powered ability and wideband operation. This article proposes a new self-powered bistable generator which is composed of three parts: the self-powered OSECE (Optimized Synchronous Electric Charge Extraction) circuit, the BSM (buckled-spring -mass) oscillator and two stoppers. The combination of the BSM oscillator and the stoppers allows wideband harvesting capability and the self-powered OSECE circuit with <b>mechanical</b> <b>switches</b> ensures high harvested power and autonomous features. A model of this novel generator is detailed and experimentally validated. As an incremental innovation, better performance is obtained for this new generator compared with the original BSM generator with the standard circuit (without stoppers and <b>mechanical</b> <b>switches).</b> Discussions and optimizations are performed to find the optimal parameters and fully investigate the performance of the proposed generator. It shows that introducing the stoppers and the self-powered OSECE circuit using <b>mechanical</b> <b>switches</b> can substantially enhance the harvested power with moderate additional complexity...|$|R

During these thermal transients, the vent valve was cooled ten times by liquid nitrogen and two times by liquid hydrogen.
