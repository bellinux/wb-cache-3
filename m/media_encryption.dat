5000|$|The SDES method {{does not}} address the [...] "end-to-end" [...] <b>media</b> <b>encryption.</b> For example, if user A is talking to user B via a proxy P, SDES allows {{negotiation}} of keys between A and P or between B and P, but not between A and B. For end-to-end media security you must first establish a trust relationship with the other side. If you use a trusted intermediate for this, the call setup delay will significantly increase, which makes applications like push-to-talk difficult. If you do this peer-to-peer, it might be difficult for you to identify the other side. For example, your operator might implement a B2BUA architecture and play the role of the other side, so that you still don't have end-to-end security. Newer, modern protocols, like ZRTP, offer end-to-end encryption for SIP/RTP calls.|$|E
5000|$|Crypto-shredding is the {{practice}} of 'deleting' data by (only) deleting or overwriting the encryption keys.When a cryptographic disk erasure (or crypto erase) command is given (with proper authentication credentials), the drive self-generates a new <b>media</b> <b>encryption</b> key and goes into a 'new drive' state. Without the old key, the old data becomes irretrievable and therefore an efficient means of providing disk sanitization {{which can be a}} lengthy (and costly) process. For example, an unencrypted and unclassified computer hard drive that requires sanitizing to conform with Department of Defense Standards must be overwritten 3+ times; a one Terabyte Enterprise SATA3 disk would take many hours to complete this process. Although the use of faster solid-state drives (SSD) technologies improves this situation, the take up by enterprise has so far been slow. The problem will worsen as disk sizes increase every year. With encrypted drives a complete and secure data erasure action takes just a few milliseconds with a simple key change, so a drive can be safely repurposed very quickly. This sanitization activity is protected in SEDs by the drive's own key management system built into the firmware in order to prevent accidental data erasure with confirmation passwords and secure authentications related to the original key required. There is no way to retrieve data once erased in this way [...] - the keys are self generated randomly so there is no record of them anywhere. Protecting this data from accidental loss or theft is achieved through a consistent and comprehensive data backup policy.|$|E

Beginning with diverse studies {{of the physical world}} and slowly transferring towards not only the biological but also the social settings in which we function on a daily basis. In addition to the physical, biological, and societal settings, one major environment that has risenmore recently is called the symbolic environment(Gross, 1981). Gross (1981) defines this symbolic element as an entity consisting of some symbolic means, <b>media,</b> <b>encryptions,</b> and constructions that individuals use to interact with one another and eventually, on which cultures are built upon. Without undermining the importance in other fields of study, it is essential to acknowledge the significance of the symbolic environment. This study focused on the use of modes in a group-conversation between individuals with different cultural backgrounds. One of the focal points was also in discovering whether or not individual’s cultural features could be apparent in the mode-use. The modes concentrated on in the study included image-, audio-, and video- attachments. An important factor that was revealed during the analysis, but not considered prior to the study, was the emergence of an additional use of mode – links. Initially, links were not part of the study,but as they were used by the participants, they were included as a fourth mode. Other key findings from the study were in relation to the understood reasons for individuals’ use of modes. Modes were attached in relation toinformation sharing, humor use, conversation initiations and continuations, and alsowhen clarifying the mode by combining text with it. Modes were used the mostto initiate humor, second highest to share information, and lastly to obtain information.
