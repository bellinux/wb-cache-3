The formation of oxides, nitrides and carbides must be avoided to yield workable metals; this is normally achieved by the Kroll process. The oxides (MO2) are reacted with coal and chlorine to form the chlorides (MCl4). The chlorides of the metals are then reacted with magnesium, yielding <b>magnesium</b> <b>chloride</b> and the metals.|$|E

5|$|The {{abundant}} inorganic elements act as ionic electrolytes. The {{most important}} ions are sodium, potassium, calcium, <b>magnesium,</b> <b>chloride,</b> phosphate and the organic ion bicarbonate. The maintenance of precise ion gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and pH. Ions are also critical for nerve and muscle function, as action potentials in these tissues {{are produced by}} the exchange of electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cell's fluid, the cytosol. Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels. For example, muscle contraction depends upon the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T-tubules.|$|E
25|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>chloride</b> is {{the name}} for the {{chemical}} compound with the formula MgCl2 and its various hydrates MgCl2(H2O)x. These salts are typical ionic halides, being highly soluble in water. The hydrated <b>magnesium</b> <b>chloride</b> can be extracted from brine or sea water. In North America, <b>magnesium</b> <b>chloride</b> is produced primarily from Great Salt Lake brine. It is extracted in a similar process from the Dead Sea in the Jordan valley. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>chloride,</b> as the natural mineral bischofite, is also extracted (via solution mining) out of ancient seabeds; for example, the Zechstein seabed in northwest Europe. Some <b>magnesium</b> <b>chloride</b> is made from solar evaporation of seawater.

25|$|Because {{magnesium}} is {{a mobile}} nutrient, <b>magnesium</b> <b>chloride</b> can be effectively {{used as a}} substitute for magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) to help correct magnesium deficiency in plants via foliar feeding. It is advisable to use a smaller dose when using <b>magnesium</b> <b>chloride</b> compared to the recommended dose of magnesium sulfate (20 g/L).

The precipitation of these cardiac and skeletal muscle changes by sodium chlorate was prevented by the prophylactic administration of either potassium or <b>magnesium</b> <b>chlorides.</b> The protective effect of these chlorides against the cardiotoxic and convulsive effects of disodium hydrogen phosphate has already been demonstrated by our earlier experiments. Sodium sulphate produced cardiac necroses in rats maintained on the same diet, and both potassium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>chlorides</b> had a prophylactic action. Unlike sodium perchlorate, however, sodium sulphate produced no muscular cramps under these conditions. Equimolecular amounts of sodium given {{in the form of}} sodium chloride (instead of sodium perchlorate, sodium sulphate, or disodium hydrogen phosphate) did not cause cardiac necroses or muscular cramps in rats maintained on the potassium-deficient diet. As the same three sodium salts, namely the perchlorate, the sulphate, and the hydrogen phosphate, produced cardiac necroses in rats sensitized by either a potassium-deficient diet or by certain corticoids, it seems that the anion must play a decisive rôle, since equivalent amounts of NaCl are ineffective...|$|R
