40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the production of}} two wavelength-selective multiplexer/demultiplexer (lambda -muldex) components intended to become parts of an integrated optical convertor for a bidirectional subscribers' access system. These are: a broadband <b>muldex</b> for 1. 3 and 1. 55 µm and a narrow-band duplexer for the 1. 3 µm band. It discusses the general background to the development and the technology of the broad-band <b>muldex,</b> describes in some detail the steps {{in the production of}} the devices by a two-stage, self-aligning etching process, and indicates the characteristics...|$|E

It {{achieves}} multiple use of a given wavelength range used as a transmission channel. The light source for the single mode transmission system may be a monomode laser. The light is transmitted via monomode optical fibres. Two optical channels (A,B) run adjacent to each other, {{and there is a}} discontinuous connection between them over N sections (S) with etched fits (g). The fits give reduced coupling and a measure of optical isolation in a regular array between coupling areas, and the whole assembly acts as an optical filter. USE - For road band optical data transmission. 4 /...|$|E

A specific or pseudo random test signals can be injected into one channel of the transmit <b>muldex</b> (S). The scrambler/descrambler has its own specification for scrambling descrambling the digital data and if no fault exists the signals are transmitted through the system and subsystems on a bit sequence independent basis; if a fault exists in the subsystem the descrambler formats the output from that subsystem into a form recognisable by the distant end receiver (E) and distinct for that subsystem. 1 /...|$|E
