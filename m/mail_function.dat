30|$|We {{proposed}} a multimodal framework for detecting game bots {{in order to}} reduce damage to online game service providers and legitimate users. We observed the behavioral characteristics of game bots and found several unique and discriminative characteristics. We found that game bots execute repetitive tasks associated with earning unfair profits, they do not enjoy socializing with other players, are connected among themselves and exchange cyber assets with each other. Interestingly, some game bots use the <b>mail</b> <b>function</b> to collect cyber assets. We utilized those observations to build discriminative features. We evaluated the performance of the proposed framework based on highly accurate ground truth—resulting from the banning of bots by the game company. The results showed that the framework can achieve detection accuracy of 0.961. Nonetheless, we should consider that the banned list does not include every game bot.|$|E

This paper presents a classification for e-mail routing issues. It clearly defines commonly used terminology such as static routing, store-and-forward routing, source routing and others. Real life examples show which routing options are used in existing projects. The goal is to define all terminology in one reference paper. This will also help relatively new mail system managers to understand the issues and make the right choices. The reader is expected to already have a solid understanding of general networking terminology.

Electronic <b>mail</b> <b>functions</b> as a medium of interpersonal exchange. As it accumulates, email data becomes more than a collection of reminders. It is a diary we didn’t know we were keeping, and a potential source of valuable insight into the structure and dynamics of one's social network. Current interfaces do little to help users see patterns of social interaction within email data. We introduce a multiscale email interface that utilizes computed intimacy measures and chronology as parameters for information visualization. Rhythms {{of intimacy}} in email experience are made visible as patterns of color and shapes in a zoomable chronological grid. Qualitative user experience data indicates that such an email visualization can provide striking insights into the experience of social connectedness over time.

This includes not only groupware, i. e., software that directly supports collaborative work, but also single user software. Research has shown that often adaptations to single user software are distributed among colleagues, thus leading to a systematization in a group’s adaptations. Based on this observation an empirical field-study on the collaborative tailoring habits of users of a particular word processor was carried out.

40|$|Abstract: Mail systems {{comprise}} different {{components to}} accomplish all mail activities. On {{the top of}} these <b>mail</b> system <b>functions</b> is the message submission, delivery, and retrieval on a target host. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMPT) is the mail transport protocol used to transfer mail between hosts. In SMTP session, like any protocol, two participants are involved. The first is the client that initiates the session and manages connection by sending requests. The other, which is the server, waits for such requests that trigger responses. This paper presents an enhanced messages delivery approach through a proposed SMTP client. A proposed architecture implementation is presented {{as well as the}} algorithm workflow for processing mails by the SMTP client. The paper provides a per-host grouping strategy that minimizes the delivery time of messages queue to multiple hosts by processing all messages belonging to the same host mail server as a one bulk. A comparative study for messages delivery with and without the grouping mechanism proved a significant reduction the the time for delivering a queue of messages. In addition to grouping, the features contributed in threading and session handling, prioritized delivery, and pipelining enhanced the way and performance of mails delivery to destination hosts...|$|R

As {{a result of the}} increased percentage of taxpayers filing returns electronically, IRS designed a detailed business plan {{to reduce the number of}} service center campuses that process paper returns. In fiscal year 2004, Brookhaven became the first service center campus to downsize its submission processing function, leading to changes in its operations and a significant reduction in the volume of taxpayer receipts and information processed. Congress requested this review in light of these significant changes in operations and IRS's desire to benefit from the Brookhaven experience in planning for future submission processing rampdowns. Specifically, we were asked to (1) review the policies and procedures IRS developed to safeguard and process taxpayer receipts and information at the modified Brookhaven operation and (2) offer recommendations, if any, for improving internal controls at Brookhaven and at other submission processing centers that will undergo future rampdowns. To accommodate the request, we agreed to add a review of the <b>mail</b> control <b>function</b> at the Brookhaven service center campus to our tests of internal controls conducted as part of our audit of IRS's fiscal year 2004 financial statements. We have performed extensive work in reviewing internal controls designed to safeguard taxpayer receipts and information as part of our annual financial audits of IRS. In performing this work, we have come to recognize the significance and importance of the submission processing function to IRS and the potential for loss, theft, or misuse of taxpayer receipts and information if controls are not properly designed and effectively implemented. Our audits have identified weaknesses in internal controls over the safeguarding of taxpayer receipts and information related to submission processing activities at IRS's service center campuses, lockbox banks, and field offices. In reviewing the Brookhaven rampdown procedures, we considered the internal control weaknesses previously found at other service center campuses. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{occupational}} exposure to ozone in ambient air can affect lung function remains unclear. We conducted a panel study in 43 mail carriers by measuring their peak expiratory flow rates (PEFRs) twice daily for 6 weeks in 2001. The daily exposure of each mail carrier to O 3, particulate matter < 10 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM 10), and nitrogen dioxide was estimated by one air monitoring station {{in the center of}} the mail carrier’s delivery area. Hourly concentrations of air pollutants during their exposure periods were 6 – 96 ppb for O 3, 11 – 249 µg/m 3 for PM 10, and 14 – 92 ppb for NO 2. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the association between air pollution exposures and PEFR after adjusting for subject’s sex, age, and disease status and for temperature and humidity. We found that night PEFR and the deviation in night PEFR were significantly decreased in association with 8 -hr O 3 exposures with a lag 0 – 2 days and by daily maximum O 3 exposures with a lag of 0 – 1 day in our multipollutant models. By contrast, neither PM 10 nor NO 2 was associated with a PEFR reduction. Daily 8 -hr mean concentrations of O 3 had greater reduction effects on PEFR than did daily maximum concentrations. For a 10 -ppb increase in the 8 -hr average O 3 concentration, the night PEFR was decreased by 0. 54 % for a 0 -day lag, 0. 69 % for a 1 -day lag, and 0. 52 % for a 2 -day lag.
