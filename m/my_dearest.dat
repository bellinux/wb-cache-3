5|$|<b>My</b> <b>dearest</b> mother, This morning, {{about four}} o'clock, I was got up, just one hour after I retired, with the {{information}} that at six {{we were going to}} Richmond. At six we started. The rebs had gone at three, along a road strewn with all the munitions of war. Richmond was reached, but the barbarous South had consigned it to flames. The roar of the bursting shells was terrific.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{could in}} the least {{palliate}} this long, this cold, this very distant separation from <b>my</b> <b>dearest</b> wife and children but the certain knowledge that I am preparing for their ease, happiness and prosperity, and when that is the prise, I know no hardships that I would not encounter with, to obtain it.|$|E

25|$|Berkeley's biographer, J. D.

25|$|Wife and I are come {{to settle}} here. We came last night, {{got up to}} a {{delightful}} spring day, {{and we are now}} enjoying the little book room, with the windows open, hearing the birds sing, and the place looking beautiful. The plants in the passage are just watered: and with the passage door open the room smells like a greenhouse. Pamela has dressed four beautiful flower-pots, and is now working at her frame, while I write to <b>my</b> <b>dearest</b> mother; and upon the two little stands are six pots of fine auriculas, and I am sitting in a bay window with all those pleasant feelings which the fine weather, the pretty place, the singing birds, the pretty wife and Frescati give me.|$|E

He had admired McKinley, describing him as [...] "awfully like Lincoln in many respects" [...] and wrote to a friend, [...] "what a strange and tragic fate it has been of mine—to stand by the bier of three of <b>my</b> <b>dearest</b> friends, Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley, three of the gentlest of men, all risen to be head of the State, and all done to death by assassins".|$|E

500|$|On 12 September, Lord Dingwall {{had landed}} at Leith, {{reporting}} that [...] "he {{had come in}} company with the Queen's fleet three hundred miles, and was separated from them by a great storm: it was feared that the Queen was in danger upon the seas." [...] Alarmed, James called for national fasting and public prayers, kept watch on the Firth of Forth for Anne's arrival, wrote several songs, one comparing the situation {{to the plight of}} Hero and Leander, and sent a search party out for Anne, carrying a letter he had written to her in French: [...] "Only to one who knows me as well as his own reflection in a glass could I express, <b>my</b> <b>dearest</b> love, the fears which I have experienced because of the contrary winds and violent storms since you embarked...". Informed in October that the Danes had abandoned the crossing for the winter, and in what Willson calls [...] "the one romantic episode of his life", James sailed from Leith with a three-hundred-strong retinue to fetch his wife personally, arriving in Oslo on 19 November after travelling by land from Flekkefjord via Tønsberg. According to a Scottish account, he presented himself to Anne, [...] "with boots and all", and, disarming her protests, gave her a kiss in the Scottish fashion.|$|E
500|$|For {{hundreds}} of years, abdominal gunshot wounds had meant death by gangrene or other infection, with doctors {{able to do}} little more than ease pain. [...] Only seventeen years previously, Dr. Emil Kocher, a Swiss surgeon, had been the first to successfully operate on a patient who had received such a wound. [...] To increase the lighting, sunlight was reflected onto the wound by another physician; {{towards the end of the}} surgery, a better light was rigged. [...] The hospital lacked basic surgical equipment such as retractors. [...] With McKinley in a weakened condition, Mann could do little probing of the wound to try to find the bullet; his work was complicated by the fact that the President was obese. [...] The surgeon made an incision in the President's skin, and found and removed a small piece of cloth which was embedded in the flesh. [...] He probed with his finger and hand, finding damage to the digestive system—the stomach displayed both an entry and exit wound. [...] Mann sewed up both holes in the organ, but could not find the bullet itself; he concluded it had lodged in the President's back muscles. [...] He later wrote, [...] "A bullet once it ceases to move does little harm." [...] A primitive X-ray machine was on display at the fair but was not used on McKinley; Mann later stated that its use might have disturbed the patient and done little good. [...] He used black silk thread to stitch the incision and wound, without drainage, and covered the area with a bandage. [...] As the operation concluded, Dr. Park arrived from Niagara Falls; he was unwilling to interfere and at 5:20, McKinley was given another shot of painkiller and allowed to awaken. [...] He was taken to the Milburn House by the electric ambulance. [...] The First Lady had not been told of the President's shooting; once the surgery was complete, the presidential physician, Presley M. Rixey, gently told her what had occurred. [...] Ida McKinley took the news calmly; she wrote in her diary, [...] "Went to Niagra [...] Falls this morning. [...] <b>My</b> <b>Dearest</b> was receiving in a public hall on our return, when he was shot by a ... Leech, in her biography of President McKinley, suggests that the First Lady could not write the word, [...] "anarchist".|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, Connolly's best friend, Danny Kyle, died. [...] "He was <b>my</b> <b>dearest,</b> dearest, oldest friend", Connolly {{explained}} to an Australian audience on his Greatest Hits compilation, released in 2001. It was Kyle who helped Connolly overcome his recoiling nature at being touched by others, {{a remnant of}} the abuse he endured as a child. [...] "Every time it happened, Danny would just collapse with hysterics," [...] said Pamela Stephenson. [...] "'That's not normal, Billy,' Danny tried to be patient with him. 'You'll have to relax. It's touchy-feely, you know, the way we live. We like to touch each other and we kiss: we're different. You'll have to calm down or you'll always be fighting.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Holbein {{broke his}} journey at Antwerp, where he bought some oak panels {{and may have}} met the painter Quentin Matsys. Sir Thomas More welcomed him to England and found him a series of commissions. [...] "Your painter, <b>my</b> <b>dearest</b> Erasmus," [...] he wrote, [...] "is a {{wonderful}} artist". Holbein painted the famous Portrait of Sir Thomas More (Holbein) and another of More with his family. The group portrait, original in conception, is known only from a preparatory sketch and copies by other hands. According to art historian Andreas Beyer, it [...] "offered a prelude of a genre that would only truly gain acceptance in Dutch painting of the seventeenth century". Seven fine related studies of More family members also survive. Granted, Cromwell had exaggerated her beauty.|$|E
