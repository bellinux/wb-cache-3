The fastest growth of small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> takes place in clusters.

The purpose of the article is to identify and evaluate the innovative potential of existing clusters of small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> in the regions of Russia.

The study found {{a low level of}} innovation activity in clusters of small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Their impact on the qualitative {{development of}} the regional economy is severely limited. The main reason is weak internal innovation potential and lack of integration with innovation generators. Technological entrepreneurship is developing poorly. The size of the cluster of small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> is insufficient to form the infrastructure and elements of the innovation system. Innovative institutions can be formally included in the cluster, but there is no real interaction. Consequently, existing clusters of small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> solve {{only a limited number of}} specific tasks. Objective advantages of the cluster (positive effects of territorial concentration, diffusion of innovations, collective interactions) need to be complemented by elements of a regional innovation system. The development of the innovative potential of clusters of small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> requires interaction with the research and development sector, development institutions, the state, and public organizations. In addition, specific support is required for innovative activity of clusters of small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Under these conditions, clusters of small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> can positively affect the quality of economic growth in the territories...|$|R
