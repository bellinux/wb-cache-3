30|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} have caught lots {{of attention in}} recent years. One of the major problems is the coverage problem. Traditionally, coverage problems concern whether a certain target area or a certain target object can be fully monitored by the sensors collaboratively. Instead of considering whether a certain area or a certain target object is completely covered, we focus on a specific coverage problem called the perimeter coverage problem. In this problem, we want to monitor the perimeter of a big target but each sensor can only <b>monitor</b> <b>part</b> of the perimeter. One typical application scenario is to monitor the coastline of a large lake so as {{to ensure that no}} people can go through its perimeter intentionally or accidentally.

The relative proper motion of a caustic-crossing binary lens can be measured with observations from a single terrestrial telescope. Thus, uniquely, binary lenses can be completely solved with only {{the addition of a}} measurement of the microlensing parallax. This solution will yield the mass, distance, and transverse velocity of the lens relative to the source. To date, only one of the ∼ 1000 observed microlensing events has been so solved. We examine the ability of a parallax satellite combined with ground-based observations to solve these events. To measure both components of the vector parallax, the lens must be observed near two different caustics. Thus, the final accuracy is determined mostly by whether one can intensively <b>monitor</b> <b>part</b> of the first caustic crossing, by the magnification pattern, and by the path of the source with respect to the lens geometry. We find that vector parallaxes can be measured far more easily for binary lenses than single lenses, requiring 1 - 3 orders of magnitude fewer photons.

40|$|In {{order to}} deal with global competition, {{industries}} have undertaken many efforts directed to improve manufacturing efficiency. From a broad perspective, the adopted approaches could be classified in two categories: 1. the simplification of manufacturing processes and relative control systems, leading to lean manufacturing methododologies and techniques; 2. the massive deployment of information tools and computational algorithms, aiming to plan and control all the activities in detail, in spite of system complexity. For several years, these two approaches have been assumed to be mutually exclusive; nevertheless, information collection and analysis are mandatory to define improvement strategies and assess their impact; therefore, the deployment of lean manufacturing methodologies cannot exclude the integration of Information Technology (IT) tools. The aim of this work is to investigate on methodologies and techniques adoptable to improve the efficacy of Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), a class of software that allows data exchange between the shop-floor and the organizational levels, enabling the implementation of the lean manufacturing approach. Today, the feedback information in the available MES mainly consists in key performance indicators, such as cycle time, work in process and resources utilization. Beside this, MES requires the integration of functionalities for process monitoring and control, aiming at the reduction of wastes and supporting continuous improvement. Hence, mathematical techniques able to analyze data in real-time and provide useful information to adaptively control the process are studied in this work. To provide the evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach, as well as the independence from any specific manufacturing technology, different case studies, both in the fields of subtractive and additive manufacturing, have been developed. In the former, a technique for the automatic alignment of a spur gear has been studied: geometrical measurements are acquired and analyzed in real-time to provide the values for two feasible part rotations resulting in the gear configuration with minimum positioning error. Such gears are manufactured for applications in aeronautics, and the deployment of this automation system is particularly significant because of the tight tolerances to be satisfied. The latter case study deals with a Fused Deposition Modeling process: an algorithm able to <b>monitor</b> <b>part</b> surface accuracy and identify defects has been developed. This methodology allows to evaluate in real-time whether the quality of the part is satisfactory or not; in case of negative response, the process can be stopped avoiding material loss. The implemented techniques enable product quality improvement, as well as the reduction of wasted material and time. Nevertheless, the deployment of such information only for process control purposes is restrictive; a framework to use this knowledge for supporting the design and the continuous improvement of a product or a process is presented. Furthermore, two case studies have been dealt to extend the application of MES tools from manufacturing operations to ancillary services. The first one is in the field of automated warehouses: a combined approach made of mathematical models and simulations has been developed. Analytical tools have been defined to evaluate the average performance of a system in simple, pre-determined situations; conversely, the simulation tool aims at a higher detail level of assessment, since in the real shop-floor deployment, different, composite storage and retrieval activities can take place. In the second case-study, mathematical models and simulation are used to support the re-design of a manufacturing process; {{the focus is on the}} transport of items through the line, performed by automated vehicles.

40|$|In {{a system}} with several stochastically failing parts and economies of scale in their maintenance, it may be {{advantageous}} to follow an "opportunistic" policy for maintenance. In opportunistic policies the {{action to be taken}} on a given part at a given time depends {{on the state of the}} other parts of the system. For the model considered in this paper, it is assumed that all parts of the system but one are inspected continuously (monitored) and that the remaining part cannot be inspected except when it is replaced. If the <b>monitored</b> <b>parts</b> have exponential distributions of time to failure, the optimal replacement policy for the remaining part has the following form: Let the non-monitored part be labeled 0 and let there be M <b>monitored</b> <b>parts,</b> labeled 1, [...] ., M; then there are M + 1 numbers n 1, [...] ., n M, N, with 0 ≦ n i ≦ N ≦∞ such that: (a) if Part i fails at a time when the age of Part 0 is between 0 and n i, replace Part i alone (i - 1, [...] ., M); (b) if Part i fails at a time when the age of Part 0 is between n i and N, then replace Parts 0 and i together; (c) if Part 0 reaches age N at a time when all <b>monitored</b> <b>parts</b> are good, replace Part 0 alone. It is demonstrated that the parameter N is finite provided that the reliability of the non-monitored part approaches zero as the age of this part goes to infinity. These results are proved for several alternative criteria for evaluating replacement policies. Computation of the parameters of the optimal policy is also discussed. Applications of this policy are discussed in [Jorgenson, D., J. J. McCall. 1962. Optimal Scheduling of Replacement and Inspection. The RAND Corporation, Memorandum RM- 3098 -PR, May. ]. ...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{competitive}} market demands frequent change in product variety, increased production volume and shorten product/process change over time. These market requirements point towards development of key enabling technologies (KETs) to shorten product and process development cycle, improved production quality and reduced time-to-launch. One {{of the critical}} prerequisite to develop the aforementioned KETs is efficient and accurate modelling of product and process dimensional errors. It is especially critical for assembly processes with compliant parts as used in automotive body, appliance or wing and fuselage assemblies. Currently, the assembly process is designed under the assumption of ideal (nominal) products and then check by using variation simulation analysis (VSA). However, the VSA simulations are oversimplified as {{they are unable to}} accurately model or predict the effects of geometric and dimensional variations of compliant parts, as well as variations of key characteristics related to fixturing and joining process. This results in product failures and/or reduced quality due to un-modelled interactions in assembly process. Therefore, modelling and prediction of the geometric shape errors of complex sheet metal parts are of tremendous importance for many industrial applications. Further, as production yield and product quality are determined for production volume of real parts, thus not only shape errors but also shape variation model is required for robust assembly system development. Currently, parts shape variation can be measured during production by using recently introduced non-contact gauges which are fast, in-line and can capture entire part surface information. However, current applications of non-contact scanners are limited to single part inspection or reverse engineering applications and cannot be used for monitoring and statistical process control of shape variation. Further, the product shape variation can be reduced through appropriate assembly fixture design. Current approaches for assembly fixture design seldom consider shape variation of production parts during assembly process which result in poor quality and yield. To address the aforementioned challenges, this thesis proposes the following two enablers focused on modelling of shape errors and shape variation of compliant parts applicable during assembly process design phase as well as production phase: (i) modelling and characterisation of shape errors of individual compliant part with capabilities to quantify fabrication errors at part level; and (ii) modelling and characterisation of shape variation of a batch of compliant parts with capabilities to quantify the shape variation at production level. The first enabler focuses on shape errors modelling and characterisation which includes developing a functional data analysis model for identification and characterisation of real part shape errors that can link design (CAD model) with manufacturing (shape errors). A new functional data analysis model, named Geometric Modal Analysis (GMA), is proposed to extract dominant shape error xixmodes from the fabricated part measurement data. This model is used to decompose shape errors of 3 D sheet metal part into orthogonal shape error modes which can be used for product and process interactions. Further, the enabler can be used for statistical process control to monitor shape quality; fabrication process mapping and diagnosis; geometric dimensioning and tolerancing simulation with free form shape errors; or compact storage of shape information. The second enabler aims to model and characterise shape variation of a batch of compliant parts by extending the GMA approach. The developed functional model called Statistical Geometric Modal Analysis (SGMA) represents the statistical shape variation through modal characteristics and quantifies shape variation of a batch of sheet metal parts a single or a few composite parts. The composite part(s) represent major error modes induced by the production process. The SGMA model, further, can be utilised for assembly fixture optimisation, tolerance analysis and synthesis. Further, these two enablers can be applied for monitoring and reduction of shape variation from assembly process by developing: (a) efficient statistical process control technique (based on enabler ‘i’) to <b>monitor</b> <b>part</b> shape variation utilising the surface information captured using non-contact scanners; and (b) efficient assembly fixture layout optimisation technique (based on enabler ‘ii’) to obtain improved quality products considering shape variation of production parts. Therefore, this thesis proposes the following two applications: The first application focuses on statistical process control of part shape variation using surface data captured by in-process or off-line scanners as Cloud-of-Points (CoPs). The methodology involves obtaining reduced set of statistically uncorrelated and independent variables from CoPs (utilising GMA method) which are then used to develop integrated single bivariate T 2 -Q monitoring chart. The joint probability density estimation using non-parametric Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) has enhanced sensitivity to detect part shape variation. The control chart helps speedy detection of part shape errors including global or local shape defects. The second application determines optimal fixture layout considering production batch of compliant sheet metal parts. Fixtures control the position and orientation of parts in an assembly process and thus significantly contribute to process capability that determines production yield and product quality. A new approach is proposed to improve the probability of joining feasibility index by determining an N- 2 - 1 fixture layout optimised for a production batch. The SGMA method has been utilised for fixture layout optimisation considering a batch of compliant sheet metal parts. All the above developed methodologies have been validated and verified with industrial case studies of automotive sheet metal door assembly process. Further, they are compared with state-of-the-art methodologies to highlight the boarder impact of the research work to meet the increasing market requirements such as improved in-line quality and increased productivity...|$|E

40|$|This paper calculates {{some of the}} {{operating}} characteristics of opportunistic replacement and inspection policies. An operating characteristic of a particular policy is a function defined on the stochastic process induced when the policy is implemented. An opportunistic replacement policy makes the replacement of a single uninspected part conditional on the state (good or failed) {{of one or more}} continuously inspected (<b>monitored)</b> <b>parts.</b> An opportunistic inspection policy makes the inspection of a non-monitored part conditional on the state (good or failed) of a <b>monitored</b> <b>part.</b> Some of {{the operating}} characteristics of these policies examined in this paper are: the expected rate of opportunistic (joint) replacement of the uninspected part and one of the monitored parts; the expected rate of planned replacement of the uninspected part; the probability of at least m failures of a <b>monitored</b> <b>part</b> in the interval [0, t]; the expected rate of opportunistic inspection [...] inspection of the non-monitored part which is triggered by a failure of the monitored part; and the expected rate of planned inspection of the non-monitored part. These operating characteristics are precisely the information needed to establish a suitable supply policy. They should also be helpful to the maintenance manager in his efforts to predict the relative frequencies of the various maintenance actions. As an example the opportunistic replacement policy is applied to the rocket engines of a hypothetical ballistic missile. Several operating characteristics are then computed and the sensitivity of these operating characteristics to changes in the rocket engine failure rate is exhibited. This illustrative analysis indicates that both the expected rate of opportunistic (joint) replacement of the rocket engines and re-entry vehicle and the expected rate of replacement of the rocket engines due to mandatory replacement are highly sensitive to changes in the rocket engine failure rate. On the other hand, the expected rate of opportunistic (joint) replacement of the rocket engines and the guidance and control system is relatively unaffected by changes in the engine failure rate. ...|$|R
