40|$|We treated {{a patient}} with hypertrophic obstructive {{cardiomyopathy}} (HOCM) who underwent DDD pacing therapy. He suffered from attacks of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) complicated by sick sinus syndrome. Initially, {{we were unable to}} decrease the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient by pacing from the mid-distal portion of the right ventricular (RV) septum. However, by changing the pacing site to the apical portion guided by right ventriculography, it was possible to decrease the LVOT gradient {{and at the same time}} reduce the mitral regurgitation. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) revealed a <b>marked</b> <b>motion</b> delay of the ventricular septum during DDD pacing. The mechanism of the therapy for HOCM provided by the DDD pacing was clearly confirmed by TDI. Furthermore, a dramatic effect of preventing symptomatic PAF with the use of overdrive pacing in the region of Bachmann's bundle was also observed. This case report provides new insight into DDD pacing therapy for patients with HOCM...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to English, Finnish has several postpositions which indicate {{in front of}} locations (edella, edessa) and behind locations (takana, jaljessa and perassa). Based on predictions generated from findings from other prepositions in English, and following the prediction by Nikanne (2003) that some postpositions <b>mark</b> <b>motion</b> while others do not, an experiment was designed to examine the influence of movement, alignment, and orientation of located and reference objects on the comprehension of in front of and behind in English and the corresponding Finnish postpositions. Native speakers of English and Finnish had to rate the appropriateness of sentences containing these terms to describe pictures of cars at various positions on a roundabout. The results show similarity between "in front of" and 7 quot;behind" terms across languages. While movement does distinguish between "behind" terms in Finnish, in both Finnish and English movement only affected the acceptability of "in front of" and "behind" when reference frame conflicts were present...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{hypothesis}} is tested that the motion pattern of small anatomic landmarks, recognizable {{at the left}} ventricular endocardial border in the contrast angiocardiogram, reflects {{the motion of the}} endocardial wall. To verify this, minute metal markers were inserted in the endocardium of eight pigs with a novel retrograde transvascular approach. <b>Marker</b> <b>motion</b> was subsequently recorded with roentgen cinematography and compared with the motion of the landmarks on the endocardial contours detected from the contrast ventriculogram with an automated contour detection system. Linear regression analysis of the directions of the systolic metal marker and endocardial landmark pathways yielded a correlation coefficient of 0. 86 and a standard error of the estimate of 10. 3 °. Landmark pathways were also measured in 23 normal human left ventriculograms. Normal left ventricular endocardial wall motion during systole, as observed in the 30 ° right anterior oblique view, is characterized by a dominant inward transverse motion of the opposite anterior and inferoposterior walls and a descent of the base toward the apex. The apex itself is almost stationary. On the basis of these observations, a widely applicable model for the assessment of left ventricular wall motion is described in mathematical terms...|$|R

5000|$|Although a {{close friend}} of Joseph Smith, Marks {{occasionally}} found himself at odds with the prophet. Smith presented evidence of why Sidney Rigdon should be rejected as first counselor in the First Presidency of the church during the October 1843 General Conference. He accused Rigdon, the long-time friend of Marks, as having lost his [...] "integrity and steadfastness" [...] and stated that he had no confidence in Rigdon's abilities as a leader in the church or as his counselor. Regardless of these accusations <b>Marks</b> <b>motioned</b> that Rigdon remain in his station as a counselor in the First Presidency. Rigdon was sustained to the position by the membership of the church. After the vote, Smith stood and stated, [...] "I have thrown him off my shoulders and you have again put him on me, you may carry him, but I will not." [...] Because Rigdon was rejected by Smith, most of the core leadership of the church, including members of the Council of Fifty and Anointed Quorum, questioned Rigdon's standing and authority and later, his claim to succeed Smith as head of the church. Rigdon and Marks were also known opponents of plural marriage. Those who supported this controversial practice instituted by Smith saw such dissent as disloyal.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Radiopaque markers were {{implanted}} in the left ventricular myocardial midwall in 58 patients and studied in the 30 ° right anterior oblique projection by computer-aided fluoroscopy. <b>Marker</b> <b>motion</b> {{was used as a}} standard of segmental wall motion against which the accuracy of five methods for measuring left ven-tricular wall motion was assessed: two methods using hemiaxial measurements in rectangular coordinates, two using radial measurements in polar coordinates (all with frame-by-frame axial reindexing) and one using radial measuremehts in fixed external polar coordinates. The latter method showed significantly les error (25. 9 %, p < 10 - 6) in measuring midwall marker motion than the other four methods (range 42. 5 - 47. 5 %) in the group as a whole and in subgroups that had abnormalities of posterior, apical and anterior wall motion. This method also had the best correlation of marker motion and motion of adjacent endocardial border (of the overall left ventricle and the posterior, apical, and anterior walls separately) as visualized by ventriculography in 29 patients. The bulk of the reduction in error using this method was due to the use of a fixed external reference system, with a small additional increment of error removed by proper selection of the polar origin at a point 69 % of the distance from the anterolateral edge of the aortic valve to the ventricular apex at end-systole.
