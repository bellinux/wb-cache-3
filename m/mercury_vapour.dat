The nitrogen post-discharge is investigated for many years theoretically {{as well as for}} a practical use. The object of this master thesis is a study of kinetic processes ongoing at titrations of <b>mercury</b> <b>vapours</b> during the nitrogen post-discharge at different pressures and applied powers. All experimental data were obtained from an optical emission spectroscopy of nitrogen post-discharge. DC discharge in flowing regime was chosen for measurements. The first part of experiments was carried out at the constant discharge current (100 mA), voltage (1300 V) and wall temperature (300 K). The total gas pressure was varied in range of 500 - 3000 Pa at nitrogen flow in range of 0. 12 - 0. 68 l/min. Nitrogen flow values were arranged to obtain constant nitrogen flow velocity for all gas pressures. The second set of experiments studied power dependencies. The current was varied in the range of 50 - 200 mA for constant voltage 1300 V. The total gas pressure in this case was 1000 Pa. <b>Mercury</b> <b>vapours</b> were introduced into the system by titration tube at different post-discharge time. The nitrogen pink afterglow effect was well visible at all experimental conditions. This effect corresponds to the maximum intensity of light emission, which expresses as considerable growth of characteristic pink radiation in the post-discharge time. Optical emission spectra of post-discharge were taken in the range of 320 - 780 nm. Besides three nitrogen spectral systems (first and second positive and first negative), the mercury line at 254 nm was recorded in the second order spectrum at 508 nm under these conditions if mercury was added. This spectral line is excited under post-discharge conditions by collisionally induced resonance energy transfer from nitrogen highly vibrationally excited ground state metastables and it opens an unique technique for their monitoring. The dependence of relative intensities on decay time for mercury spectral line and selected nitrogen spectral systems at different titration positions were measured. The relative intensities of nitrogen bands decrease with increasing of mercury line relative intensity for all total gas pressures. The pink afterglow phenomenon shifts to the later decay times with the increasing of total gas pressure. In the case of experiments at different power, {{it can be seen that}} with decreasing power mercury spectral line intensity decreases in post-discharge time. The first detailed tests of the unique detection for highly excited of nitrogen metastables were completed. However this master thesis is concentrated on the basic research which supports better indication of kinetic processes and reactions leading to transformation of excitation energy, this new knowledge should be applied in future also in technologies based on the long-lived metastable induced reactions...|$|R

One of the crucial stages of HgCdTe epitaxy is CdTe nucleation on GaAs substrate. Successful composite substrates have been obtained with suitable substrate preparation, liner and susceptor treatment, proper control of background fluxes and ap-propriate nucleation conditions. Due to the large mismatch between GaAs and CdTe, both (100) and (111) growth may occur. It mostly depends on substrate disorientation and preparation, nucleation conditions and growth temperature.

Applying the heat of the blowpipe to it, you see how the heat drives off the vapour; and if you notice {{at the end of the}} Lecture, you will observe on the stone a purple patch of condensed gold. Thus you see a proof of the volatilisation of gold. It is the same with silver. You will not be startled if I sometimes use one agent and sometimes another to illustrate a particular point. The volatility of gold and silver is the same thing, whether it be effected by the voltaic battery or by the blowpipe. [A lump of silver was placed in a charcoal crucible between the poles of a voltaic battery.] Now, look at the fumes of silver, and observe the peculiar and beautiful green colour which they produce. We shall now shew you this same process of boiling the silver, cast on a screen from the electric lamp which you have before you; and while Dr. Tyndall is kindly getting the lamp ready for this purpose, let me tell you that Deville proposes to throw out in this way all these extraneous things that I have spoken of, except two--namely, iridium and rhodium. It so happens, as he says, that iridium and rhodium do make the metal more capable of resisting the attacks of acids than platinum itself. Alloys are compounded up to 25 per cent. of rhodium and iridium, by which the chemical inaction of the platinum is increased, and also its malleability and other physical properties. [The image of the voltaic discharge through vapour of silver was now thrown upon the screen.] What you have now on the screen is an inverted image of what you saw when we heated the silver before. The fine stream that you see around the silver is the discharge of the electric force that takes place, giving you that glorious green light which you see in the ray; and if Dr. Tyndall will open the top of the lamp, you will see the quantity of fumes that will come out of the aperture, shewing you at once the volatility of silver.|$|E

This study has been made within the artisanal gold mining in Santo Domingo, Nicaragua. The {{focus has been on}} the burning process in the artisanal gold extraction. The recommendation from United Nation Environmental Program, to introduce mercury capturing devices to reduce the emissions, has been evaluated. The mercury retort enclose the <b>mercury</b> <b>vapours</b> and the vapours condensate and the mercury can be reused. It is a low-tech device that fits the existing conditions in Chontales. This study has been assessing the potential to make the artisanal gold mining less polluting and damaging to health and evaluating the willingness of the artisanal gold miners in Chontales, Nicaragua to adopt the technology mercury retort. Seven artisanal gold miners were interviewed and mercury retorts were shown to the gold miners who were not familiar with the technique. The information gained from the interviews suggest that the poorest artisanal gold miners know about the risks with mercury but did not know about the technique mercury retort, but they were willing to learn and had a positive approach to start using it to save mercury and money. Mercury retorts could be built in Nicaragua for a cost of 7 US$. It is cheap to build a mercury retort in Nicaragua and the device prevents the vapours to enter the atmosphere. The factor that is limiting the adoption of mercury retorts is the lack of information and knowledge within the communities. More information should be given to the artisanal gold miners if more people should start using mercury retorts. Mercury should be phased out from artisanal gold mining, but until it is done, mercury retort could be a way to reduce the 727 tons of mercury which each year enters the atmosphere thru burning of gold amalgam worldwide...|$|R

In this study, basal serum concentrations of pituitary hormones (thyrotrophin (TSH), prolactin (PRL), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinising hormone (LH] or their response after administration of thyrotrophin and gonadotrophin releasing hormones did not differ between 11 male workers (mean urinary Hg (U Hg) concentration 26 nmol/mmol creatinine) and nine male dentists (U Hg concentration 1. 3 nmol/mmol creatinine) exposed to elemental Hg vapour when compared with matched referent groups (U Hg concentration 0. 6 and 0. 4 nmol/mmol creatinine). Thus {{there was no evidence}} of an effect of Hg on the pituitary. Neither was there any association between exposure to Hg and serum concentrations of free thyroid hormones (S FT 3, S FT 4), testosterone, or cortisol. Increased plasma concentrations of selenium (Se) were associated with increased basal serum concentrations of TSH, decreased concentrations of basal serum cortisol, and decreased release of FSH...|$|R
50|$|Free mercury ions {{can bind to}} metalloproteins, {{particularly}} those with cysteine residues, and can cause incorrect conformations resulting in function loss. This can cause death in many bacteria, as can many other heavy metals, and thus, needs {{to be removed from}} the cell or transformed into a chemically inert form. Mercury(II) reductase takes Hg2+ and catalyzes its reduction into Hg0 which is then released from the cell as a <b>vapour.</b> <b>Mercury</b> in its elemental form does not have the ability to form stable complexes with amino acid residues in proteins so is less dangerous than its ionic form.|$|R
