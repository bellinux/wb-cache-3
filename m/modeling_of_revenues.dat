40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is based on <b>modelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> streams in a {{sweatshop}} Klokánek. At the beginning the reader will get familiar with basic terminology and methods related to marketing analysis and time series forecasting that will be later on applied in the practical part using historical business data. The aim is to create quantitative basis for pricing and estimation <b>of</b> <b>revenues</b> for a selected product, partly based on competing sweatshops pricing and quality of services. The particular forecasting was conducted for several variants of sales levels: Holt-Winters method, Monte Carlo simulation, SARIMA. These inputs were collected for the recommendations that were provided {{in the end of}} the thesis...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{question}} {{the nature and}} dimensions of eValues. We apply our approach to electronic marketplaces (EMPs), as an illustration of interorganizational information systems. The research is based upon 50 interviews made in 6 EMPs, and a thematic analysis on the themes linked to “the value of EMPs”. Our results categorise the different perceptions of eValues according to the different profiles: the value proposition of EMPs’ managers and the perceived values of buyer and supplier managers. We highlight that eValue is a key component that helps to distinguish three types of EMP business models: the Buy-type, the Supply-type and the Indus-type. Finally, we discuss the orientation <b>of</b> each business <b>model</b> according to the current value it offers to customers, and conclude {{that the concept of}} eValue questions the design <b>of</b> the <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> <b>of</b> EMPs. 1...|$|R

Using farm-level data these characteristics were identified by estimating a logit <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> insurance purchase decisions by farm operators. Results indicate that farm operators with the ability to self-insure through accumulation of sufficient wealth reserves measured in terms of the ratio of debts-to-assets, operators with off-farm income, and participation in production and marketing contracts, are more likely to pursue these strategies as a substitute for federal revenue insurance programmes. Further, study finds that older and wealthy cash grain farmers are less likely to buy revenue insurance. ...|$|R

We then verified the existence of synergies between banking and insurance divisions of financial conglomerates, using the financial data of the respective banking and insurance divisions of fourteen European financial conglomerates. From among them, we collected the data of the respective banking divisions of twelve financial conglomerates, separately for personal banking and corporate banking, and determined the existence of synergies among the personal banking division, corporate banking division and insurance division of the financial conglomerates.

40|$|We {{study the}} welfare impact <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> management, i. e. intertemporal price {{discrimination}} when the product availability is limited both {{in time and}} quantity, and consumers' arrival is random. This practice is particularly relevant, and widely spread, in the transport industry, but {{little is known about}} its implications on profits and consumer surplus. We develop a theoretical <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> management allowing for heterogeneity in product characteristics, capacity constraints, consumer preferences, and probabilities of arrival. We also introduce dynamic competition between revenue managers. We solve this model computationally and recover the optimal pricing strategies. We find that revenue management is welfare enhancing. Revenue managers face two types of constraints: a limited booking period and fixed capacities. Previous sales affect the relative slackness of these two constraints, explaining price variations. Profits increase as the practice offers more leeway to the seller compared to posting a fixed price throughout the booking period. Total consumer surplus also increases for a wide range <b>of</b> specifications, as <b>revenue</b> management raises the number of sales. In the presence of heterogeneous consumers, consumers with low price sensitivity subsidize ones with high price sensitivity when demand is low but both types benefit from the practice when demand is high.

But this new activity is also a new source <b>of</b> <b>revenues</b> for those vertically integrated ISP-CDNs, which can sell those services to content providers.

Our model incorporates the possibility for the vertically-integrated ISP to partially offer CDN services to competitors in order to optimize the trade-off between CDN revenue (if fully offered) and competitive advantage on subscriptions at the ISP level (if not offered to competitors). Our results highlight two counterintuitive phenomena: an ISP may prefer an independent CDN over controlling (integrating) a CDN; and from the user point of view vertical integration is preferable to an independent CDN or a no-CDN configuration. Hence, a regulator may want to elicit such CDN-ISP vertical integrations rather than prevent them...|$|R
40|$|The {{bursting}} of {{the house}} price bubble in 2008 - 09 {{has led to a}} situ-ation where local governments that rely on property tax revenues are in a precarious position.

If there is no change in the effective tax rate applied to the property tax base, revenues fall substantially, affecting the local government’s ability to provide public goods and services.

The consumers are heterogeneous in their valuations or willingness to pay.

Consumers with higher valuations, e. g. business travelers, learn their true valuations after the ones with lower valuations, e. g. leisure travelers.

In this article, the authors present a <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> generation across four sequential distribution channels, combining choice-based conjoint data with other information. Drawing on stratified random samples for three major markets-namely, the United States, Japan, and Germany-and a total of 1770 consumers, the empirical results suggest that the studios that produce motion pictures can increase their revenues by up to 16. 2 % through sequential distribution chain timing and order changes when applying a common distribution model for all movies in a country and that revenue-optimizing structures differ strongly among countries. Under the conditions of the study, the authors find that the simultaneous release of movies in theaters and on rental home video generates maximum revenues for movie studios in the United States but has devastating effects on other players, such as theater chains.
