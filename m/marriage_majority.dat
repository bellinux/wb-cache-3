40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} level of {{knowledge}} of the adolescent girls regarding reproductive health issues. Materials and methods: A cross sectional descriptive type of study was carried out among 150 unmarried adolescent girls of Vashantek slum in Dhaka city by face to face interview using a semistructured questionnaire from January to June 2008. Results: The {{mean age of the}} respondents were 16. 4 ± 2. 9 years ranging from 10 - 19 years. Out of 150 respondents, 130 had history of menstruation and their median age of menarche was 13 years. The correct knowledge was high among the adolescent having secondary level of education than the SSC and above or primary level of education and the difference was statistically significant (p< 0. 05). About three-fourths of the respondents had sufficient knowledge about hygienic menstrual practice. Majority of the girls could mention the legal age of marriage. Regarding the demerits of early <b>marriage,</b> <b>majority</b> mentioned some of the demerits but not all. Three-fifths of the respondents had no knowledge on importance of family planning and regarding the methods of family planning, majority of them had no knowledge. Majority of the respondents heard the disease AIDS but regarding the knowledge on causative agent half of them had no knowledge. More than two-fifths had no knowledge on mode of transmission of AIDS. It was also found that majority of the respondents had no knowledge on symptoms of AIDS and three-fifths had no knowledge on prevention of AIDS. Conclusion: So formal, informal and special educational program may be taken to educate the adolescent girls on reproductive health issues and government should be more concerned about this. </p...|$|E

This paper studies the nature, frequency and value of remittances from farm servants to their parents in three countries during the eighteenth century. Important differences emerge from this comparative study. Farm servants in Belgium and France frequently supported their parents financially with their earnings.

Although smaller shares of women entered marriage at each age across cohorts, there is increasing diversity in the timing and context of marriage. Family Forming marriage continues to be the <b>majority</b> <b>marriage</b> experience, but Direct Family Forming marriage has declined and Post-Cohabitation Family Forming marriage has increased. Conception-Related Legitimizing marriages became more important in Central and Eastern Europe, but less common in Western and Anglo-Saxon countries. Limited evidence for growth in post-first-birth marriages suggest that childbearing intentions or a first conception continue to be important triggers for marriage, although this may be changing in Nordic, Western European and Anglo-Saxon countries.

5000|$|Finding {{that the}} {{fundamental}} right to marriage is inclusive of same-sex <b>marriage,</b> the <b>majority</b> goes on to strict scrutiny analysis.

[...] As to the first argument, and citing Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, the state notes that Virginia voters {{have the right to}} determine what <b>marriage</b> is. The <b>majority</b> counters with the reasoning that [...] "the people's will is not an independent compelling interest that warrants depriving same-sex couples of their fundamental right to marry," [...] and goes on to cite West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette: [...] The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections. [...] As to the second argument, the majority responds citing Heller v. Doe ex rel. Doe: [...] "The Supreme Court has made it clear that, even under rational basis review, the 'ancient lineage of a legal concept does not give it immunity from attack.'" [...] In dismissing the third and fourth arguments, the majority finds that the Supreme Court severed the link between marriage and children and upheld a right not to procreate in Griswold v. Connecticut: [...] Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions. [...] It also states: [...] "If Virginia sought to ensure responsible procreation via the marriage ban, the laws are woefully underinclusive. Same-sex couples are not the only category of couples who cannot reproduce accidentally. For example, opposite-sex couples cannot procreate unintentionally if they include a post-menopausal woman or an individual with a medical condition that prevents unassisted conception.... We therefore reject ... attempts to differentiate same-sex couples from other couples who cannot procreate accidentally. Because same-sex couples and infertile opposite-sex couples are similarly situated, the Equal Protection Clause counsels against treating these groups differently." [...] Also, the [...] "responsible procreation argument falters for another reason as well. Strict scrutiny requires that a state's means further its compelling interest. ... Prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying and ignoring their out-of-state marriages does not serve Virginia's goal of preventing out-of-wedlock births. Although same-sex couples cannot procreate accidentally, they can and do have children via other methods." ...|$|R

40|$|Being {{rare and}} stigmatized, lesbian, gay, and {{bisexual}} (LGB) people are hard-to-survey. Gaining their participation, reducing concealment of LGB identity, and accurately measuring their marital status are challenging. In this dissertation, I {{examine the effects}} that LGB-inclusive tailoring—inclusive cover image design and “same-sex” and “opposite-sex” marital status categories—has on addressing these challenges; particularly, the effect on who responds to a survey and the answers that they provide, among LGB and non-LGB people. The experiments were embedded in the 2013 Nebraska Annual Social Indicators Survey (NASIS), a general population mail survey of Nebraskans (n= 1, 608). I test how the LGB-inclusive cover design and marital status categories influenced the percent of LGB respondents; the percent of respondents who are in same-sex relationships; unit and item nonresponse; the demographic, political, and religious composition of respondents; reports to attitudinal questions about LGB issues; and how non-LGB respondents report their marital status. In the final part of this dissertation, I examine whether the red-blue state and urban-rural narratives reflect Nebraskans’ opinions about LGB issues. Analyses showed that the inclusive cover design increased the percent of LGB respondents without a significant backlash from others in the population and little effect on answers to LGB issue questions. The LGB-inclusive marital status categories, however, {{did not address the}} challenges of measuring same-sex couple identity. Instead, the inclusive wording led to higher item nonresponse and to more heterosexual respondents misreporting their marital status. Additionally, I observed that Nebraska does not fit a red state narrative, with equal favorability and opposition to same-sex <b>marriage</b> and <b>majority</b> support for other LGB rights; although, I found that rural respondents reported significantly more conservative opinions than urban respondents, consistent with that frame. Overall, this dissertation suggests that inclusive cover designs might be useful for encouraging hard-to-survey populations’ participation, that more research is necessary to accurately measure marital status, and that Nebraskans’ opinions about LGB issues are more complex than people often assume.
