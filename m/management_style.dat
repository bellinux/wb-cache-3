40|$|Cross {{cultural}} {{researchers have}} asked {{to what extent}} culture affects working and <b>management</b> <b>styles</b> {{of people in a}} given society.

Working and <b>management</b> <b>styles,</b> therefore, should not be different across cultures. On the other hand, specific management practices, said some experts, are in fact influenced by culture and therefore management practices should be tailored in accordance with a given cultural environment.

5|$|CT was {{involved}} in a criminal investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the mid-1990s of Ed's Transmission, a transmission shop in Everett used by the agency for bus parts. Detectives from the FBI and Snohomish County Sheriff seized records from both parties and began a two-month audit of Community Transit management. The auditors released a report that criticized the <b>management</b> <b>style</b> of Executive Director Ken Graska and his department heads, leading to the former's resignation in December 1993 after nine years at his position. Federal prosecutors accused Ralph Woodall, the 50-year-old co-owner of the shop, of 15 counts of mail fraud after intentionally overbilling for transmission repairs. Community Transit Maintenance Director Michael Lynn resigned after confessing that he had accepted gifts from Woodall in exchange for sending all of CT's transmissions to Ed's Transmissions without going through competitive bidding. A U.S. District Court jury found Woodall guilty of 15 counts of mail fraud in December 1996, with Judge John C. Coughenour sentencing him to 2.5 years in federal prison the following May, along with Ed's Transmission being forced to pay a $825,000 settlement after a civil suit was filed.|$|E
5|$|Harrison quickly saw the {{enactment}} of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act in 1890, a cause he had championed while in Congress. In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability), the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. Pension expenditures reached $135million under Harrison, the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by Pension Bureau commissioner James R. Tanner's expansive interpretation of the pension laws. An investigation into the Pension Bureau by Harrison's Secretary of Interior John W. Noble found evidence of lavish and illegal handouts under Tanner. Harrison, who privately believed that appointing Tanner had been a mistake, due to his apparent loose <b>management</b> <b>style</b> and tongue, asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with Green B. Raum. Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for expediting pension cases. Harrison, having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican investigation report that exonerated Raum, kept him in office {{for the rest of his}} administration.|$|E
5|$|McKnight {{remained}} at North Castle until John Morgan, the Director General, ordered him and Samuel Adams, Jr. (the son of Samuel Adams of Massachusetts) {{to set up}} a new hospital near Peekskill, New York, for more than 300 sick soldiers of General William Heath's division. Unable to find an acceptable site for a hospital, the two surgeons took over accommodations in Fishkill, New York, twenty miles north of Peekskill. Washington, however, sent convalescents to Peekskill because Morgan told him the hospital was there. Morgan was dismissed as Director General soon thereafter, in January 1777, due to rancor with Washington over supplies and a rampant smallpox epidemic then raging its way through the army. Morgan's <b>management</b> <b>style</b> rankled the surgeons, including McKnight, as Morgan was wrestling with Shippen, McKnight's mentor, over control of the hospitals in New Jersey. Isaac Foster took over temporary supervision of the hospitals {{on the east side of}} the Hudson River after Morgan's dismissal at Washington's request.|$|E

The results from 221 participants indicate that positive and negative relationships exist among the dimensions of intercultural sensitivity and conflict <b>management</b> <b>styles,</b> Millennials show a preference for conflict <b>management</b> <b>styles</b> that reflect a concern for self, and Millennials report high Interaction Confidence and low Respect for Cultural Difference.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the relationships between}} age level characteristics and complementary instructional <b>management</b> <b>styles.</b> The data gathered from published materials provided the information for the research survey questions on teaching styles and age level characteristics. The data gathered from teachers who are currently in the field {{provided the basis for}} determining there is a relationship between PreK- 8 teachers’ instructional management profiles and their preferences for teaching either lower (PreK- 3) or upper (4 - 8) elementary grade students. Together, published information and survey results indicated that: (1) different instructional methods are more developmentally appropriate for different ages of learners; (2) teachers have natural preferences for particular management styles; and (3) there are distinguishing instructional <b>management</b> <b>styles</b> between teachers who choose to teach at lower grade levels (PreK- 3) and those who choose to teach at upper grade levels (4 - 8). The researcher used two survey instruments to measure teachers’ instructional <b>management</b> <b>styles</b> and their grade level preferences. The Chi Square analysis of grade level preferences by instructional <b>management</b> <b>styles</b> was significant, indicating the proportion of teachers in the four instructional <b>management</b> <b>styles</b> who preferred to teach lower elementary students differed from the proportion of teachers who preferred to teach upper elementary students. The results of the research indicated that educational leaders could use the survey instruments to predict satisfaction for teachers and effective teaching for students. Other research suggested that teachers who teach grade levels of students that generally match their natural instructional <b>management</b> <b>styles</b> would likely enjoy greater job satisfaction, which, as a result, may lead to more effective teaching and longevity in the classroom. Based on the data obtained from research and the survey of teachers’ instructional <b>management</b> <b>styles</b> and grade level preferences, pre-service teachers can make informed career decisions...|$|R

5|$|President John Patrick Crecine {{proposed}} a controversial restructuring in 1988. The Institute {{at that point}} had three colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the College of Computing, the College of Sciences, and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs. Crecine announced the changes without asking for input, and consequently many faculty members disliked him for his top-down <b>management</b> <b>style.</b> The administration sent out ballots in 1989, and the proposed changes passed with very slim margins. The restructuring took effect in January 1990. While Crecine was seen in a poor light at the time, the changes he made are considered visionary. In January 1994, Crecine resigned.|$|E
5|$|The {{three decades}} after the 1952 Grey Cup victory have been called the Argonauts' Dark Ages. The team went thirty-one years between {{championship}} victories and nineteen without even making an appearance in the final. Part of the reason was a salary cap introduced in 1953 that cost them many talented players. For {{the first time in}} decades, they began ranking {{at the bottom of the}} Eastern Division. The <b>management</b> <b>style</b> under new owner John Bassett has also been blamed: young talent was traded or allowed to leave and the team could not form a nucleus of championship players; coaches came and went rapidly. Two notable events occurred off-field at the end of the 1950s: in 1958 the Argonauts became a founding member of the Canadian Football League and a year later found a new home at Exhibition Stadium.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationships among individualism-collectivism (IND-COL), conflict <b>management</b> <b>styles</b> and conflict satisfaction. The authors aim to {{explain some of the}} inconclusive findings in the literature related to IND-COL and conflict styles by studying IND-COL as states, rather than dispositional traits. By taking a dynamic approach to conceptualizing IND-COL and measuring IND-COL over time, we investigate how different ratios of individualistic-to-collectivistic orientations are associated with different conflict <b>management</b> <b>styles.</b> Results show that individuals who employed a balanced focus (1 : 1 ratio) of both individualistic and collectivistic orientations utilized an integrative style in conflict more than individuals with either a strong individualistic or collectivistic orientation. Integrative style was associated with higher levels of satisfaction with conflict outcomes, processes, relationships, goal attainment and job satisfaction at work. Individuals with predominant focus on individualism utilized a dominating style more, whereas individuals with predominant focus on collectivism utilized obliging and avoiding styles. Furthermore, results show that state-level IND-COL is a better predictor of conflict <b>management</b> <b>styles</b> than trait-level IND-COL. Past research has focused on studying IND-COL primarily as a trait variable at the individual level, but we examine IND-COL as states in relation to conflict <b>management</b> <b>styles.</b> In addition, we investigate the combined and optimal effects of both individualism and collectivism value-orientations on conflict <b>management</b> <b>styles...</b>|$|R

In their 2013 study, Kask and Linton develop two ideal profiles, or also known as configurations or archetypes, for startups that are commercializing inventions. The inheritor profile calls for a <b>management</b> <b>style</b> that is not too entrepreneurial (more conservative) and the startup should have an incremental invention (building on a previous standard). This profile is {{set out to be}} more successful (in finding a business partner) in a market that has a dominant design (a clear standard is applied in this market). In contrast to this profile is the originator which has a <b>management</b> <b>style</b> that is highly entrepreneurial and in which a radical invention or a disruptive innovation (totally new standard) is being developed. This profile is set out to be more successful (in finding a business partner) in a market that does not have a dominant design (established standard). New startups should align themselves to one of the profiles when commercializing an invention {{to be able to find}} and be attractive to a business partner. By finding a business partner a startup will have greater chances to become successful.|$|E
