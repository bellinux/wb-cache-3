She has since been researching financial crises, financial contagion, capital controls, <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulations,</b> foreign investment and tax holidays.

50|$|In the Mood Swing paradigm, investors’ and consumers’ animal spirit induces {{an overly}} optimistic mood {{in good times}} of tracing the mispriced asset price signals, which accumulates {{excessive}} risk that runs down the financial system and the economy {{when there is a}} bad shock. Then ex-ante <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulations</b> can play a role to manage overall mood and alert the risks.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011 he won {{the second}} Financial Times annual essay contest on banking {{regulation}} sponsored by the International Centre for Financial Regulation. He wrote about how the G-20 major economies could increase financial stability with <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulations</b> that [...] "leans against the credit cycle" [...] using examples from the UK, South Korea, and the United States. Specifically, he [...] "advocated a global tax on non-core banking liabilities {{as the best way}} to deflate bubbles".|$|R
5000|$|On {{theoretical}} grounds, it {{has been}} argued that a reform of prudential regulation should integrate three different paradigms: the agency paradigm, the externalities paradigm, and the mood swings paradigm. The role of <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation</b> is particularly stressed by the last two of them.|$|E
50|$|The {{main goal}} of <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation</b> {{is to reduce}} the risk and the {{macroeconomic}} costs of financial instability. It is recognized as a necessary ingredient to fill the gap between macroeconomic policy and the traditional microprudential regulation of financial institutions (Bank of England, 2009).|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} measure {{systemic}} risk, <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation</b> relies on several indicators. As mentioned in Borio (2003), {{an important distinction}} is between measuring contributions to risk of individual institutions (the cross-sectional dimension) and measuring the evolution (i.e. procyclicality) of systemic risk through time (the time dimension).|$|E
40|$|Notwithstanding {{the rapid}} growth in the {{popularity}} of and {{the increasing number of}} research papers on macroprudential policy, the general public still has a relatively unclear perception of this concept. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to explain briefly the most important concepts related to macroprudential policy and describe its objectives. Emphasis is put on explaining the main stages of a macroprudential cycle, the relationship between macroprudential policy and other economic policies, and the costs and benefits of <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulations...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} model in which a {{financial}} intermediary's investment in risky assets - risk taking - is excessive due to limited liability and deposit insurance and characterize the policy tools that implement efficient risk taking. In the calibrated model, coordinating interest rate policy with state-contingent <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulations,</b> either capital or leverage regulation, and a tax on profits achieves efficiency. Interest rate policy mitigates excessive risk taking by altering both the return and the supply of collateralizable safe assets. In contrast to commonly used capital regulation, leverage regulation has stronger effects on risk taking and calls for higher interest rates...|$|R
5000|$|Using {{data from}} the UK, Aiyar et al. (2012) find that {{unregulated}} banks in the UK {{have been able to}} partially offset changes in credit supply induced by time-varying minimum capital requirements over regulated banks. Hence, they infer a potentially substantial [...] "leakage" [...] of <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation</b> of bank capital.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Macroprudential</b> <b>regulation</b> is the {{approach}} to financial regulation that aims to mitigate risk to the financial {{system as a whole}} (or [...] "systemic risk"). In the aftermath of the late-2000s financial crisis, there is a growing consensus among policymakers and economic researchers about the need to re-orient the regulatory framework towards a macroprudential perspective.|$|E
50|$|Some {{theoretical}} {{studies indicate}} that macroprudential policies may have a positive contribution to long-run average growth. Jeanne and Korinek (2011), for instance, show that in a model with externalities of crises that occur under financial liberalization, well-designed <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation</b> both reduces crisis risk and increases long-run growth as it mitigates the cycles of boom and bust.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{employing}} several econometric techniques, {{the authors}} construct a financial stress index (CNFSI) and a financial conditions index (CNFCI) {{to measure the}} instability of China's financial system. The indices {{are based on the}} monthly data collected from China's inter-bank markets, stock markets, foreign exchange markets and debt markets. Using these two indices, the authors identify the episodes of systemic financial stress, and then evaluate the indices. The empirical results suggest that the CNFSI performs better than the CNFCI. Furthermore, the authors propose four leading indicators for monitoring China's financial instability, and provide a primary early warning system for China's <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulations.</b> Finally, they conduct a test to evaluate the predictive power of the CNFSI and the early warning system with reference to the 2015 episode. Their results suggest that both work well...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors build upon Assenza et al. (Credit {{networks}} in the macroeconomics from the bottom-up model, 2015), which include firm-bank and bank-bank {{networks in the}} original macroeconomic model in Macroeconomics from the bottom-up (Delli Gatti et al., Macroeconomics from the Bottom-up, 2011). In particular, they extend that framework with {{the inclusion of a}} public sector and other modifications in order to carry out different policy experiments. More specifically, the authors test the implementation of a monetary policy by means of a standard Taylor rule, an unconventional monetary policy (i. e. cash in hands) and a set of <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulations.</b> They explore the properties of the model for such different scenarios. Their results shed some light on the effectiveness of monetary and macroprudential policies in an economy with an interbank market during times of crises...|$|R
40|$|A fast-growing {{literature}} on small open economy models with pecuniary externalities {{has provided the}} theoretical grounds for the policy analysis of macro-prudential regulations and bailouts. Benigno, Chen, Otrok, Rebucci, and Young (2012 a) recently showed that the macro-prudential regulations are desirable if the policy instrument is restricted to capital controls. Using the framework of Jeanne and Korinek (2010), we show that this result depends on the functional form of the collateral constraint which households are faced with. If households collateralize their assets that they purchase {{at the same time}} as their borrowing, capital controls in the form of bailout subsidy during crises can be optimal because they can achieve the …rst best allocation. If, on the other hand, the maximum borrowing is constrained by their assets that they have purchased before they borrow, a stronger case can be made for ex ante <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulations...</b>|$|R
50|$|On the {{international}} level, {{there are several}} potential sources of leakage and arbitrage from <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation,</b> such as banks' lending via foreign branches and direct cross-border lending. Also, as emerging economies impose controls on capital flows with prudential purposes, other countries may suffer negative spillover effects. Therefore, global coordination of macroprudential policies is considered as necessary to foster their effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|This {{inefficiency}} {{is particularly}} relevant in financial economics. When some agents {{are subject to}} financial constraints, then changes in their net worth or collateral that result from pecuniary externalities may have first order welfare implications. The free market equilibrium {{in such an environment}} is generally not considered Pareto efficient. This is an important welfare-theoretic justification for <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation</b> that may require the introduction of targeted policy tools.|$|E
5000|$|Farhi {{started his}} career in the Economics {{department}} of Harvard in 2006 and was tenured in 2010. Though highly quantitative, his work strives to shed light on practical issues such as <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation,</b> mitigating the impacts of economic crises or understanding the implications of fiscal policies. For example, he assessed the controversial Social VAT, a measure introduced by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and repealed by his successor Francois Hollande only to reemerge under a different form: the [...] "Competitiveness Pact".|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on small open economy models with collateral constraints has pro-vided the theoretical grounds for <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulations.</b> This paper examines a subsidy on debt during a crisis {{as a form}} of bailout in comparison to prudential capital controls. We show that the policy prescription on bailouts di¤ers substantially between the timing assumptions of the collateral constraint of households. If borrowing is con-strained by the value of assets that households have purchased before they borrow, the bailout is neutral, suggesting that prudential capital controls are preferable. If, on the other hand, households collateralize their assets that they purchase {{at the same time as}} their borrowing, the bailout replicates the unconstrained allocation without collateral constraint and outperforms prudential capital controls. Even in the latter case, how-ever, our numerical experiments suggest that such bailouts restoring the unconstrained allocation may not be implementable in terms of its size and frequency...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we build}} a dynamic {{stochastic}} general-equilibrium model with housing and household debt, {{and compare the}} effectiveness of monetary policy, housing-related fiscal policy, and <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulations</b> in reducing household indebtedness. The model features long-term fixed-rate borrowing and lending across two types of households, and differentiates between the flow and the stock of household debt. We use Bayesian methods to estimate parameters related to model dynamics, while level parameters are calibrated to match key ratios in the U. S. data. We find that monetary tightening is able to reduce the stock of real mortgage debt, but leads {{to an increase in}} the household debt-toincome ratio. Among the policy tools we consider, tightening in mortgage interest deduction and regulatory loan-to-value (LTV) are the most effective and least costly in reducing household debt, followed by increasing property taxes and monetary tightening. Although mortgage interest deduction is a broader tool than regulatory LTV, and therefore potentially more costly in terms of output loss, it is effective in reducing overall mortgage debt, since its direct reach also extends to home equity loans...|$|R

50|$|The 2007/2008 {{financial}} crisis highlighted {{that a small}} turmoil can cause a big fallback in the financial system - mainly because financial institutions form a highly interconnected network. From a network science point of view this means that some nodes (institutions) have very high degree, i.e. they are linked to many other nodes. As a consequence, they {{play a central role}} in the system, which can be highly important in the case of disturbances. Recognition of this effect led to the revival of <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the {{externalities}} paradigm, the key {{concept is}} called pecuniary externality. This {{is defined as}} an externality that arises when one economic agent's action affects the welfare of another agent through effects on prices. As argued by Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986), when there are distortions in the economy (such as incomplete markets or imperfect information), policy intervention can make everyone better off in a Pareto efficiency sense. Indeed, a number of authors have shown that when agents face borrowing constraints or other sorts of financial frictions, pecuniary externalities arise and different distortions appear, such as overborrowing, excessive risk-taking, and excessive levels of short-term debt. In these environments macroprudential intervention can improve social efficiency. An International Monetary Fund policy study argues that risk externalities between financial institutions and from them to the real economy are market failures that justify <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As of late 2011, {{there had}} been some trends {{consistent}} with a move away from economic liberalism, including a growing acceptance for a return to the use of Capital controls, <b>Macroprudential</b> <b>regulation</b> and State capitalism. On the other hand, China has been progressively liberating its capital account well into 2012, while in the United States the Tea party emerged as a powerful political force, with members who appear to be committed to a purer vision of the free market than has existed since the peak of classical liberalism in the 1840s. [...] George Monbiot said in 2013 that neoliberalism remained an influential ideology. In 2011, professor Kevin Gallagher suggested that rather than being largely governed by a single ideology as had been the case for the previous eras, the newly emerging global order is influenced by [...] "varieties of liberalism".|$|E
40|$|Speculative capital inflows {{raised the}} {{exchange}} rate and stock prices in Iceland in the prelude to the financial turmoil that gripped the country in 2008. Speculators profited from the interest differential {{as well as the}} continued appreciation of the currency from 2004 to 2008 and the rise of stock prices. The inflow was not sustainable because domestic debt was increasing at an unsustainable pace, faster than the rate of interest. Investors attempted to leave the krona when international capital markets became unstable in 2008 and the foreign risk premium rose. The sudden stop of the inflows left most domestic businesses in technical default as well as many households, the banks collapsed and the currency lost half its value. Capital controls were imposed to stem the outflow. Now seven years later, capital controls are being relaxed and the inflow of speculative capital has started again. The paper describes the <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulations</b> that have been passed in recent years and the possible ways the authorities could reduce the inflows or change their nature from short-term to long-term investment. The issue whether a very small economy can have a floating exchange rate and a free flow of capital is discussed...|$|R
40|$|We offer a {{framework}} for <b>macroprudential</b> banking <b>regulation,</b> with a particular emphasis on Latin American countries. Building on previous theoretical work (Rochet 2004) we argue that the main reason behind the high frequency and large magnitude of banking crises {{in the last two}} decades of the XXth century may be the lack of independence of banking supervisors from political powers. We examine how such an independence could be organized, and in particular how banking authorities should manage the banking crises of the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{resumption}} of capital flows to emerging market economies since mid 2009 has posed {{two sets of}} interrelated challenges for policymakers: (i) to prevent capital flows from exacerbating overheating pressures and consequent inflation, and (ii) {{to minimize the risk}} that prolonged periods of easy financing conditions will undermine financial stability. While conventional monetary policy maintains its role in counteracting the former, there are doubts that it is sufficient to guard against the risks of financial instability. In this context, there have been increased calls for the development of macroprudential measures, with an explicit focus on systemwide financial risks. Against this background, this paper analyses the interplay between monetary policy and <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulations</b> in an open economy DSGE model with nominal and real frictions. The key result is that macroprudential measures can usefully complement monetary policy. Even under the "optimal policy," which calls for a rather aggressive monetary policy reaction to inflation, introducing macroprudential measures is found to be welfare improving. Broad macroprudential measures are shown to be more effective than those that discriminate against foreign liabilities (prudential capital controls). However, these measures are not a substitute for an appropriate moneraty policy reaction. Moreover, macroprudential measures are less useful in helping economic stability under a technology shock.

40|$|<b>Macroprudential</b> <b>regulation,</b> {{which has}} emerged as a new {{departure}} in financial regulation (albeit with a longer heritage), since the financial crash, is in a fluid, evolving and highly experimental phase. Understanding its future political economy requires engaging with macroprudential's constituent concepts and how they interrelate to one another. This paper argues that the emerging political economy of <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation</b> revolves around five paradoxes. The first three of these are paradoxes that characterise the financial system and are identified by the macroprudential perspective. In seeking to respond to these paradoxes, macroprudential policy, generates a further two distinctly institutional and political paradoxes. The last of these is a central bankers' paradox which relates to the source of independent central bank authority and the difficulty of building legitimacy and public support for <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation.</b> Functioning <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation</b> is about executing a technocratic control project that rests on a depoliticisation strategy, that in turn risks politicising central banks, exposing their claims to technical authority to critical scrutiny and potential political backlash. This is the ultimate central bankers’ paradox in the era of post-crash political economy. Central banks conducting <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation</b> {{need to be aware of}} this paradox and handle it with great care...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{eruption}} of the global financial crisis in 2008, <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation</b> has become a mantra in the regulatory world. The soon-to-be-widespread adoption of macroprudential tools will inevitably affect {{the dynamics of the}} economy and consequently have a direct bearing on the conduct of monetary policy. This paper explores theoretically several issues surrounding the interplay between <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation</b> and monetary policy. Among the key issues examined are the economic stabilization role of rule-based macroprudential policy, the implications of a countercyclical capital requirement on the monetary transmission mechanism, and the optimal policy combination. ...|$|E
40|$|Although the <b>macroprudential</b> <b>{{regulation}}</b> only {{became a}} central topic of bank regulation after 2008, recognising and analysing risk, what now we call macroprudential, has formed {{part of the}} thinking about banking risk for a long time. A real turn of events {{was caused by the}} Global Financial Crisis. Since then, {{as a consequence of the}} huge taxpayers’ burden and the mutual reinforcing effect of sovereign and banking crises, the main course of bank regulation has become the elaboration and implementation of regulation with a macroprudential perspective. This article reviews the history of the international evolution of <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation</b> from the perspective of both the regulation’s motivations and its conceptual and practical developments. Its main focus is the development of the ideas of a macroprudential perspective on prudential policy and the way these ideas eventually led to concrete experiences with macroprudential regulatory tools. As a conclusion, the author raises the question of whether the financial system has become more stable by implementing the current form of <b>macroprudential</b> <b>regulation...</b>|$|E

Die Autoren des Zeitgespr 4 chs halten Finanzielle Repression f kein geeignetes Entschuldungsinstrument, weil sie nicht zielgenau wirkt, zu einer Fehlallokation von Kapital f und mit der Gefahr einer weiteren Krise verbunden ist. Financial repression {{committed by}} central banks {{has been put}} forward {{as a means to}} secretly reduce the real burden of high public debts.

A mix of conventional budget consolidation and rapid growth was the main driver in this relative debt reduction with a minor role for financial repression. But does financial repression really exist? The authors express different opinions on evidence for this concept. Those authors who find that there are indicators of financial repression fear redistributive tendencies between debtors and creditors and high opportunity costs in the form of savings and investment distortions. Therefore, financial repression is not a 'cure' for the high public debts amassed in the euro area during the recent sovereign debt and banking crisis. Furthermore, the high sovereign debts in the euro area may threaten economic development and impose high costs on society. Therefore, reducing these debts is politically highly relevant, and fiscal policy should be characterised by a modest reduction in government spending and/or tax increases, combined with a policy promoting economic growth. <b>Macroprudential</b> <b>regulations</b> should supplement this financial policy...|$|R
