In trapezoidal and parabolic channels, the governing equations are highly nonlinear in the <b>normal</b> {{and critical}} <b>flow</b> depths and thus solution of the implicit equations involves numerical methods (except for critical depth in parabolic channels).

For the trapezoidal cross section, the maximum error of critical flow depth is less than 6  ×  10 − 6 % (near exact solution) and the <b>maximum</b> error of <b>normal</b> depth is less than 0. 25 % (very accurate solution).

40|$|Due to the {{aperture}} problem, the only general unambiguous motion measurement in images is <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> [...] -the projection of image motion on the gradient direction. In this paper we show how a monocular observer can estimate its 3 D motion {{relative to the}} scene by using <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> measurements in a global and mostly qualitative way. The problem is addressed through a search technique. By checking constraints imposed by 3 D motion parameters on the <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> field the possible space of solutions is gradually reduced. In the four modules that comprise the solution, constraints of increasing restriction are considered, culminating in testing every single <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> value for its consistency {{with a set of}} motion parameters. The fact that motion is rigid defines geometric relations between certain values of the <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> field. The selected values form patterns in the image plane that are dependent on only some of the motion parameters. These patterns, which are determined by the signs of the <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> values, are searched for in order to find the axes of translation and rotation. The third rotational component is computed from <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> vectors that are only due to rotational motion.

In this paper, we propose a method to construct control flow graph by computing separately <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> and exception flow. We show that <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> and exception flow can be safely decoupled, hence these two flows can be computed separately. We propose the analysis that estimates exception-induced control flow, and also propose exception flow graph that represents exception induced control flows.

Basically, this technique is an adaptation made with in the Newton-Raphson iterative scheme in an attempt to speed up the nonlinear solution process and/or remove convergence problems.
