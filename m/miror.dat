When some flatterer hinted that Johnson had {{taken more than}} his right share of the evening's talk, Burke said, [...] "Nay, it is {{enough for me to}} have rung the bell for him." [...] Some one else spoke of a successful imitation of Johnson's style. Burke with vehemence denied the success: the performance, he said, had the pomp, but not the force of the original; the nodosities of the oak, but not its strength; the contortions of the sibyl, but none of the inspiration. When Burke showed the old sage of Bolt Court over his fine house and pleasant gardens at Beaconsfield, Non invideo equidem, Johnson said, with placid good-will, <b>miror</b> magis. They always parted in the deep and pregnant phrase of a sage of our own day, except in opinion not disagreeing. In truth, the explanation of the sympathy between them is not far to seek. We may well believe that Johnson was tacitly alive to the essentially conservative spirit of Burke even in his most Whiggish days. And Burke penetrated the liberality of mind in a Tory, who called out with loud indignation that the Irish were in a most unnatural state, for there the minority prevailed over the majority, and the severity of the persecution exercised by the Protestants of Ireland against the Catholics exceeded that of the ten historic persecutions of the Christian Church.|$|E

40|$|More {{often than}} not, in {{theoretical}} discussions about translation, {{there has been}} a predominance of Western thought (Tymoczko, 2006). This dominance has been reflected principally in the concentration on linguistic aspects of translation, {{as well as in the}} importance given to written texts over any other form of expression. This fact has led to skepticism about metaphorical or non-linguistic studies of translation and non-Western approaches to this field. Nevertheless, there is a growing belief in Translation Studies that translation does not always involve a textual or linguistic practice, but that it can also take place within only one language, and even more, without implying any text at all (Bhabha, 1994; Venuti, 1992; Douglas, 1997; Young, 2003). Moving in that same direction, this thesis offers a metaphorical approach to translation that attempts to expand the boundaries of Translation Studies and resist certain previous Western-oriented conceptualizations of translation. Through examination of the works and a body to remember with and Le pavillon des <b>mirors,</b> written by Carmen Rodriguez and Sergio Kokis, respectively, this thesis contends that their fictional characters may be considered as both linguistically and culturally "translated beings" (Rushdie, 1991). Throughout this discussion, the concept of metaphorical translation refers to the never-ending process of transformation and transculturation that Rodriguez and Kokis' fictional characters undergo in their migrant experience. In other words, this thesis examines Rodriguez and Kokis' literary representations of migrants and their experience with translation as a transformation process. The dislocation caused by migration takes the form of social, linguistic, cultural, and psychological disarticulations, which are typified through images and metaphors of translation. These images and metaphors represent the main focus of analysis in this study. Therefore, this thesis brings about a broader idea of translation than the explicit interlingual transference of meaning. Both migration and its subsequent cultural mingling produce complex situations that are discussed in the works analyzed. First, this thesis examines the spatial and temporal related images and metaphors of translation within Rodriguez and Kokis' works. The aim here is to determine how these characters manage to overcome the loss of their place after migration and how this fact affects their roots. Second, in an attempt to evaluate whether the metaphorical translation of Rodriguez and Kokis' characters symbolizes a successful or a failed translation, this thesis considers specific aspects in characters' identity construction throughout the stories. Finally, their discourses are evaluated to discuss the linguistic conflicts stemming from the tension between mother tongue and adoptive language...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Previous {{research}} {{within the}} Musical Interaction Relying On Reflection (<b>MIROR)</b> project has underestimated children’s own voices when investigating learning enhancing music technology. This study uncovers six young children’s perspectives regarding {{what is possible}} to learn when interacting with a novel music technology known as <b>MIROR</b> Body Gesture (BG). Theory: The theoretical framework of Variation theory is adopted to explore the intended, enacted and lived object of learning. Method: Document analysis, video observations and interviews shed light on what the children {{in this study are}} enabled to learn when using this specific music technology. This analysis exposes a distinct discrepancy between the different objects of learning. Results: The children expressed that this technology provided them with the possibilities to; experience contrast between different sounds, become aware of the technology’s function to generate these differences or variations in the sounds and of their own movements’ function to initiate these variations. These lived experiences are distinct from the intended object of learning which aimed at increasing children’s awareness of the different sound morphology including pitch, lateralization, distortion, density and dynamic accent. The learners’ perspectives also provided insight that verified and refuted the researcher’s perspectives concerning the learning situation. This insight gives a clearer overview of what is possible to discern through using BG and presents implications for its further improvements...|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores young {{children}} and music learning in the ecology of music technologies. The research {{is a part of}} an EU project called <b>MIROR</b> (Musical Interaction Relying on Reflection) that had the intention to develop software for music learning designed to promote specific cognitive abilities in the field of music improvisation. The overarching aim of this thesis is to explore activities where children (and adults) interact with and around the music technology <b>MIROR</b> Impro, and what this participation allows and supports children to learn, including musical learning. The research focuses on the participants’ interaction with each other and in relation to the instrument connected to the software. Participants in the empirical studies are 4 - 8 -year-old (with an emphasis on 6 -year-old) children in a Swedish preschool and in an afterschool centre. The theoretical framework is a sociocultural perspective. A point of departure is the understanding of learning as an act of participation in communities of practice rather than as an individual, cognitive process of internalizing knowledge. According to this perspective, learning is situated in a context and mediated by cultural tools (physical such as musical instruments as well as discursive ones) which are included in the unit of analysis. The results are presented in four empirical studies. Together, these studies show that despite the technology being launched as self-instructive and work as an ‘advanced cognitive tutor’, in situations where a more experienced participant is engaged and interact with the children, their opportunities to learn in and about music is enhanced. In these contexts, the teacher is vital to help the children to conceptualize and identify musical possibilities. The make-believe play communicatively frames the activity in a way that creates meaningfulness and helps children make sense. By interacting verbally with the children as a co-creator, the teacher goes into dialogue with them about a musical content and thus provides opportunities for emerging music learning...|$|E

40|$|According to {{the most}} {{important}} work in his literary activity, F. Galović (1887 – 1914) can be placed somewhere between the Croatian »moderns« (1895 – 1914) and the Croatian literary avant-garde (1910 – 1923). This is particularly evident from his principal prose works, the short stories »Začarano ogledalo« (Enchanted <b>Miror,</b> 1912) and »Ispovijed« (Confession, 1914). The most characteristic part of the creative work of Ivo Vojnović is sublimated in the »Enchanted Mirror«, while the »Confession« anticipates things to come that will later on be chiefly manifested in the literary work of the early Krleža. Since Ivo Vojnović {{was one of the}} main representatives of the Croatian »Moderna«, and Miroslav Krleža the outstanding champion of the Croatian literary Avant-garde, one could say that Galović, by his two drams, and particularly by his liric poetry, did not only creatively link two great Croatian writers Vojnović and Krleža – but also the two literary movements, i. e. the Croatian »Moderna« and the Croatian literary Avant-garde. All considered, one might conclude that F.

40|$|The {{databases}} record {{instances of}} deponency, {{which is the}} term we have adopted to describe mismatches between morphology and morphosyntax. The prototypical example are the deponent verbs of Latin, which involve a mismatch between passive form and active meaning. That is, a normal Latin verb had active forms such as amō 'I love' and amāvī 'I have loved', which contrasted with the passive forms amor 'I am loved' and amātus sum 'I have been loved' (in this case, with a masculine subject). A deponent verb, on the other hand, looks like the passive but functions like the active, as in <b>mīror</b> 'I admire', mīrātus sum 'I have admired'. In the the databases we construe deponency in an extended fashion, covering any mismatch between the apparent morphosyntactic value of a morphological form and its actual value in a given syntactic context.

These deformations can be defined for classical pseudo-differential operators but they are used here on formal pseudo-differential operators {{in order to get a}} differential geometric framework to deal with the KP hierarchy that is known to be completely integrable in the sense of Frobenius. Here, we get an integration of the Zakharov-Shabat connection form by means of smooth sections of a (differential geometric) bundle with structure group some groups of q-deformed operators. The integration obtained by Mulase M 1, and the key tools he developped, are totally recovered on the germs of the smooth maps of our construction. The tool coming from (classical) differential geometry used in this construction is the holonomy group, on which we have an Ambrose-Singer-like theorem: the Lie algebra is spanned by the curvature elements. This result is proved for any connection a diffeological principal bundle with structure group a regular Frölicher Lie group. The case of a (classical) Lie group modelled on a complete locally convex topological vector space is also recovered and the work developped in Ma,Ma 2 is completed. Comment: Differences from the last version: the example of application to the kp hierarchy is added (section 5); section 1. 5. is considerabily enlarged, and <b>miror</b> changes have been made in the rest of the text.

Some of these details are: - There is no special word for money in Hebrew. Most frequently the word for silver [kèsef] is used to denote a money transaction. - For money, as for weight, the shekel [shèkel] was the standard unit, the pieces of metal (gold or silver) being either fractions or multiples of the shekel. Very often the term shekel of silver [shèkel kèsef] is used. There was a Temple-tax, called shekel of the sanctuary [shèkel ha-kòdesh], which had different divisions in the different periods, according to the dominant system – half silver shekel (Exodus, 30 : 13), third silver shekel (Nehemiah, 10 : 33). The “half silver shekel of the sanctuary” consists of twenty gerahs [gerà] (Exodus, 30 : 13). The gerah is supposed {{to be some kind of}} seed, perhaps a bean or some such plant. - Before the Babilonian Exile (VI-th century B. C.) there is no data on coins used by Israelites. At that period the metals were weight but not coinaged. To disprove the opinion that during the whole period before the Exile coined money was unknown the passage in I Samuel, 9 : 8 is cited. Here it is related that Saul's slave gave him the fourth part of a shekel of silver, which he had with him. The conclusion, however, that this is a reference to coined money is too hasty. Even after the Babilonian Exile the coins are rarely mentioned in the text of Old Testament. Such coin is the Persian darics, denarii or Persian drahma [darkmonìm] (Ezra 8 : 27). - Mina [minà] is a unit consisting of shekels. In Bulgarian it is translated as фунт (funt) and in English as pound or mina. When the decimal system made its way into use, the gold mina as well as the silver mina was reckoned at 50 such shekels. Consequently there was (1) the Babylonian silver mina, equivalent to 50 / 45 = 10 / 9 of a mina of weight; (2) the Phenician silver mina, equivalent to 100 / 135 = 20 / 27 of a mina of weight. There was also Alexandrian mina. - Talent [kikàr]. The term kikar, generally rendered talent. It signifies something round or circular, suggesting a ring of this weight to be used as money. The bundles of money carried by the sons of Jacob to Egypt for the purchase of grain (Genesis, 42 : 35) were probably silver rings tied together in bundles. It is evident from the Talmud (Bek. 5 a) that a kikar contained sixty mina. But there are different mina – Hebrew, Babylon, Egypt, Attic. - Ephah [ephà]. Very often [ephà] is used in exchange transactions despite that it is a measure of capacity but not of weight. It is a dry measure. According to BibleWorks 98 the ephah is about 60 kilograms. - There were three different systems for weights and money – Egyptian, Babylonian and Phoenician. In different periods the Jews used different one. One of the differences between Babylonian and Egyptian systems was the Decimal and sexagesimal division of an unite. - Everyone of these three systems had heavy (“royal”) and a light (“common”) talent, mina, shekels, gera et ctr. - Almalech shows in linguistic analysis of the Hebrew words, and the Hebrew and Bulgarian text of the Bible. For example the word [shèkel] means ‘be weight’; from the same root is the noun balance, scales [mishkàl], the verb to measure, to weigh [shakàl]. - Archeological finds are cited – the weights (shekels) were made as little sculptures – in the form of spindle or barrel, each have 12 faces, some of them has a lion stamped on each face save one, reminding of the lion-weights discovered in Assyria and Babylonia. Some weights are of black stone, the others of bronze. - The hypothesis of Sir Charles Warren is taken for basis of speculation because it represents a system of synonymy measures for the elements and the dimensions of the world. Egyptians and Babylonians built different systems on the following relations: cubes of the measures of length and ascertained how many grains of barley corresponded to the quantity of water these cubes would contain; the weight of a cubic inch of rain water – grains; a talent weight of a cubit cubed, equal to the weight of grains; deriving from this the minah (1 / 60 of the talent) of 9, 600 grains, and a shekel (1 / 50 of the minah) 192 grains. - Almalech recalls the “toys of Zagrei” or “the sacral objects”. Zagrei is a chthonic-solar hypostasis of Thracian Dionis. They are bowl, sphere, strobile, rhomb, <b>miror,</b> and apple. The “toys of Zagrei” are magical objects referring to the doctrinal grading of the structure of the Cosmos. They were used also for mythological designation of the initiation into the Orphic cult in the Ancient Thracian and Greek world. Comparing the “toys of Zagrei’ to the sculpture and geometrical forms of weights, Almalech represents the hypothesis that the spring of the money is hidden into the religious secret knowledge of ancient initiated people. They presented their knowledge on the structure of the Universe in the geometrical and sculpture forms of the ancient weights. Afterwards a different cultural and social process took place – the coinage of money. ...|$|E
