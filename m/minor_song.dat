American Youth Rebellion in 1980 s as {{presented}} through <b>Minor</b> Threat’s <b>songs.</b> Thesis: English Department of Faculty of Letters and Fine Arts Sebelas Maret University. This research is conducted {{to find out}} the presentation of the American Youth Rebellion in the 1980 s by analyzing some songs written and performed by one of 1980 s American hardcore bands called Minor Threat. As a 1980 s American youth band, <b>Minor</b> Threat’s <b>song</b> lyrics combined with hardcore music present 1980 s American youth rebellion. Youth age as the transitional period between childhood and adulthood becomes a period where youth refuses to stay in childhood values but also refuses to enter adult world and its values. In this transition period, the youth rebellion emerges as the resistance of the social values. During Minor Threat’s existence in 1980 s, the United States of America was in a great recession period when the country experienced transitions in many sectors. Some American youth speak up their disappointment toward the condition and express their rebellion through hardcore music. The objective of this research is to find out how American youth rebellion in 1980 s is presented through <b>Minor</b> Threat’s <b>songs.</b> The source of data used in this research is <b>Minor</b> Threat’s <b>songs</b> in its EPs (Extended Play/Mini Album). The main data are eight <b>Minor</b> Threat’s <b>songs</b> which are taken from its EPs entitled Minor Threat (released in 1981 by Dischord Records) and In My Eyes (released in 1981 by Dischord Records). These songs are chosen as they are related to the topic of research. The supporting data are taken from books, articles, interviews and websites. This research applies library research in the form of analytic qualitative research. Since this research is carried out within American Studies discipline, it employs interdisciplinary approaches which bring the consequences of applying some theories and approaches. They are semiotic theory, music theory, sociological approach and biographical approach. These approaches and theories are related each other to get the meaning of <b>Minor</b> Threat’s <b>songs</b> as the presentation of American youth rebellion in 1980 s. From the analysis, it can be concluded that <b>Minor</b> Threat’s <b>songs</b> present American youth rebellion in 1980 s through their song lyrics and music. The subject matter of <b>Minor</b> Threat’s <b>song</b> lyrics are rebellion towards 1980 s American negative youth lifestyle and rebellion towards 1980 s American social values. The song lyrics are straight forward and use some sarcastic terms. These song lyrics are combined with hardcore music which is aggressive; the music is played in fast beat, while the singer sings the song lyrics in a scream and shouted vocal style. All of these elements are bound up into <b>Minor</b> Threat’s <b>songs</b> that present American youth rebellion in 1980 s...|$|R
5000|$|Use {{of minor}} keys. The {{canonical}} songs are almost universally in <b>minor.</b> <b>Songs</b> {{based in the}} Russian or klezmer traditions normally use the harmonic minor (that is, with an elevated seventh), while songs in the New Hebrew style use natural minor, often with a diminished second leading to the tonic. Songs in this style are also sometimes modal, or semimodal, ending on the dominant rather than the tonic. An example is Moshe, by Emmanuel Zamir, sung by Yaffa Yarkoni.|$|R

5000|$|... "These Days" [...] was {{developed}} by Powderfinger after a request by film director Gregor Jordan, who asked the band to write a song for his upcoming film, Two Hands, after showing them scenes in which the song would appear. Lead singer Bernard Fanning initially wrote the D <b>minor</b> <b>song,</b> and it was demoed in the garage of guitarist Darren Middleton.

5000|$|Four of {{the stage}} show's musical numbers ("Come to Me, Bend to Me", [...] "There But For You Go I", [...] "From This Day On", and [...] "The Sword Dance") were cut prior to the film's release. The Breen office refused to allow {{the use of the}} two songs the Meg Brockie {{character}} sang in the stage version ("The Love of My Life" [...] and [...] "My Mother's Wedding Day"), as the lyrics were considered too risqué for general audiences. With the omission of these songs, the supporting role of Meg Brockie was reduced in the film to scarcely more than a bit part. The <b>minor</b> <b>song</b> [...] "Jeannie's Packin' Up" [...] was also omitted. Some of this was done because, after listening to Gene Kelly's pre-recordings of [...] "There But For You Go I" [...] and [...] "From This Day On", the makers of the film felt that the results did not show his voice to its best advantage, but some was done because producer Arthur Freed wanted to shape the two-and-a-half hour stage musical into a film that ran 108 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|The first ASL {{music video}} that they created {{was for a}} song called Where'd You Go (Fort <b>Minor</b> <b>song)</b> a group founded by Mike Shinoda famous {{for his role in}} Linkin Park. Upon {{completing}} the video, D-PAN shared the video with Shinoda who dismissed it and didn’t want to endorse the video. This upset Forbes thinking that musicians didn’t want to make their music accessible to the 30 million plus members of the deaf and hard of hearing community. D-PAN then set out to find an artist who had a song and message that would resonate with the deaf community. This led them to Waiting on the World to Change by John Mayer. The D-PAN music video features many members of the deaf and hard of hearing community, many who had never experienced music. This music video became an anthem for the deaf community. To date, D-PAN has created music videos for Christina Aguilera"Beautiful", Eminem [...] "Lose Yourself" [...] (featuring Forbes), Owl City [...] "Fireflies" [...] and with the support of Jack White from The White Stripes they created a music video for We're Going to Be Friends which has received millions of views on YouTube.|$|E

50|$|In 1957 a Parisian gallery {{organized}} a restrospective exhibition of Maclet’s work, and the solid {{rise in the}} prices of Maclet’s paintings dates from that retrospective exhibition. When Maclet made sporadic visits to Paris during his years {{in the south of}} France, the painters of Montmartre and Montparnasse considered him a painter on the rise; the canvases he had produced {{while he was in the}} south of France showed that the peasant from Picardy had become a master. But the general public in France did not grasp his importance and value until 1957.Five years of life remained to the painter, years beautifully described by Marcel Guicheteau and Jean Cottel in these words: “Maclet had returned to his first loves, to his first poems; but it was with all his experience, all his wisdom that the old man now bent over the familiar motifs; his <b>minor</b> <b>song</b> had become a song full of light. In the evening of his life he could repeat himself without copying himself; explain himself without humiliating himself; remember himself without destroying himself. He had brought his work to such a degree of perfection that each painting from then on justified itself by references to earlier work and conferred, in a sense, a retroactive value on those works of a far-off past. The artist had reached the state wherein his work soundly established, across the years, its various pictorial values like echoes answering each other at intervals of ten, fifteen, twenty years, all singing the same harmony.” The gardener from Picardy became a master painter.|$|E
