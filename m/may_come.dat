5|$|Because it isn't {{as close}} to its star as its sister planets Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c, the Kepler team {{suggests}} that its light density <b>may</b> <b>come</b> from a large hydrogen and helium atmosphere {{that has not been}} blown away by the stellar wind.|$|E
5|$|Staff {{available}} for employment include entertainers, security guards, mechanics, and handymen. Lack of staff can cause problems, including messy footpaths, rides breaking down, crime, and unhappy visitors. If visitors become unhappy, thugs <b>may</b> <b>come</b> to vandalise the park by committing offences such as popping balloons, stealing food, and beating up entertainers. Occasionally, wages {{and the price}} of goods must be negotiated; failure to reach an agreement results in staff strikes or loss of shipment.|$|E
50|$|In September 2012, the 82nd Thames Sailing Barge Match took place. Cambria won and Edith <b>May</b> <b>came</b> fifth behind Thalatta, Lady of the Lea and Pudge.|$|R
6000|$|So {{the year}} rolled round, and <b>May</b> <b>came</b> again. Uncle Dan was well satisfied, Aunt Becky's {{preparations}} were completed, and Ruth had not [...] "changed her mind." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. <b>May</b> <b>came.</b> It {{was decided}} to keep open the theatre. He would find some one else for the piano, some one else to issue the tickets.|$|R
5|$|Students {{may apply}} for {{financial}} aid such as the Ontario Student Assistance Program and Canada Student Loans and Grants through the federal and provincial governments. The financial aid provided <b>may</b> <b>come</b> {{in the form of}} loans, grants, bursaries, scholarships, fellowships, debt reduction, interest relief, and work programs. In the 2010–11 academic year, Queen's provided $36.5 million worth of student need-based and merit-based financial assistance.|$|E
5|$|Swinefield's {{last name}} <b>may</b> <b>come</b> from Swingfield located near Folkestone, Kent. His father was Stephen of Swinfield, {{who died in}} 1282, and his brother Stephen {{remained}} a layman. No other information about his family and upbringing, including his date of birth, has emerged. He was a doctor of divinity degree, but where he graduated is not known.|$|E
5|$|Teams {{consist of}} 15 members who <b>may</b> <b>come</b> from {{different}} countries. Individuals may prearrange teams or sign up individually, {{in which case}} they are randomly grouped into appropriately sized teams.

5|$|The {{challenge}} <b>may</b> <b>come</b> {{from working}} {{outside in the}} elements. It could be 50 degrees when we rehearse and 50 below on game day, we're working under the pretext {{that we can be}} doing this in snow or rain... In a normal indoor environment we have seven minutes to install the stage and get it camera ready. That can be stretched to nine minutes. It's the same time frame for this.|$|E
5|$|Being {{chemically}} stable, neptunium phosphates {{have been}} investigated for potential use in immobilizing nuclear waste. Neptunium pyrophosphate (α-NpP2O7), a green solid, has been produced in the reaction between neptunium dioxide and boron phosphate at 1100°C, though neptunium(IV) phosphate has so far remained elusive. The series of compounds NpM2(PO4)3, where M is an alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs), are all known. Some neptunium sulfates have been characterized, both aqueous and solid and at various oxidation states of neptunium (IV through VI have been observed). Additionally, neptunium carbonates {{have been investigated}} to achieve {{a better understanding of}} the behavior of neptunium in geological repositories and the environment, where it <b>may</b> <b>come</b> into contact with carbonate and bicarbonate aqueous solutions and form soluble complexes.|$|E
5|$|Cavities are {{in great}} demand for nesting by other cavity nesters, so {{woodpeckers}} face {{competition for the}} nesting sites they excavate {{from the moment the}} hole becomes usable. This <b>may</b> <b>come</b> from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity nesting birds like swallows and starlings. Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use other strategies to reduce the chance of being usurped from their nesting site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces the chance that a larger species will take it over and expand it.|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means. There is {{the young}} Frenchman, Jean Coulois, who is engaged for the season. A {{wonderful}} pair, indeed! When <b>May</b> <b>comes,</b> {{they go to the}} music-halls in Paris and London." ...|$|R
60|$|Phil and <b>May</b> <b>came</b> forth at once, but {{the former}} would not remain to supper. He had to visit Mr Blurt, he said, and might perhaps sup with him. Pax {{would go with}} him.|$|R
60|$|Dr. <b>May</b> <b>came</b> {{back with}} George, and stayed to dinner, {{after which he}} talked over {{business}} with Flora, whose sagacity continually amazed him, and who undertook to make her husband understand, and do what was needed.|$|R
5|$|Hastings {{eventually}} switched {{sides and}} joined the Labour Party. His conversion, especially {{in the light of}} later events, was regarded by some as suspect: his entry in the Dictionary of Labour Biography reports speculation that Hastings foresaw that Labour <b>may</b> <b>come</b> to Government and had few senior lawyers to fill the Law Officer posts. John Paton, after speaking from the same Independent Labour Party (ILP) platform as Hastings, {{came to the conclusion that}} Hastings gave political speeches using his skill as a lawyer to master a brief; on the train home, Hastings appeared not to have heard of the ILP.|$|E
5|$|Laws {{have been}} passed {{in many areas of}} the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. Public {{perception}} of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies. Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they <b>may</b> <b>come</b> into conflict with humans. In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.|$|E
5|$|Students {{may apply}} for {{financial}} aid such as the Ontario Student Assistance Program and Canada Student Loans and Grants through the federal and provincial governments. The financial aid provided <b>may</b> <b>come</b> {{in the form of}} loans, grants, bursaries, scholarships, fellowships, debt reduction, interest relief, and work programs. In the 2015-2016 academic year, McMaster students received approximately $100.2 million in Canada-Ontario Integrated Student Loans and $32.1 million in grants, approximately $132.3 million in total. In the same year students received approximately $10 million in bursaries.|$|E
60|$|When, {{after an}} hour's painful walk, Mr. <b>May</b> <b>came</b> to Bullwell Station and found {{there was no}} train till six in the evening, {{he felt he was}} earning every penny he would ever get from Mr. Houghton.|$|R

50|$|A club which {{received}} a promotion to Liga FAM <b>may</b> <b>came</b> from multiple different leagues such as Liga Bolasepak Rakyat, state league and Liga Bola Sepak IPT which all were managed {{by a different}} management which has been sanctioned by FAM.|$|R
5|$|Sycamore {{trees are}} very {{variable}} across their wide range and have strategies to prevent self-pollination, which is undesirable because it limits the genetic {{variation of the}} progeny and may depress their vigour. Most inflorescences are formed of a mixture of functionally male and functionally female flowers. On any one tree, one or other of these flower types opens first and the other type opens later. Some trees may be male-starters in one year and female-starters in another. The change from one sex to the other may take place on different dates {{in different parts of}} the crown, and different trees in any one population <b>may</b> <b>come</b> into bloom over the course of several weeks, so that cross-pollination is encouraged, although self-pollination may not be completely prevented.|$|E
5|$|The Pasha'a daughter, Murana, {{finds him}} hiding and orders her servant {{to assist in}} Jack's escape. Guards appear and {{announce}} that {{they are looking for}} the escaped prisoner, but they are turned away. Dressed up as a woman, Jack tries to have Murana flee with him. She says that one day she cannot marry him now, but she <b>may</b> <b>come</b> to his country one day. Jack trades a flower for his business card and departs. A year later, Jack and his mother have a visitor ushered and they stand in confusion at the beautiful young woman. Jack does not recognize her until she covers her face with her veil and she announces her intention to be his bride.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is {{a medical}} nutrition therapy that involves participants from various disciplines. Team members include a registered paediatric dietitian who coordinates the diet programme; a paediatric neurologist who is experienced in offering the ketogenic diet; and a registered nurse who is familiar with childhood epilepsy. Additional help <b>may</b> <b>come</b> from a medical social worker who works with the family and a pharmacist who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines. Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in {{many aspects of the}} diet for it to be safely implemented.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will keep}} the memory of to-night in my heart of hearts," [...] I said. [...] "You shall never repent the trust you have reposed in me. <b>May</b> I <b>come</b> to you to-morrow? <b>May</b> I <b>come</b> as early as nine o'clock?" ...|$|R
60|$|When Alvina {{had played}} God Save the King she went round behind the stage. But Ciccio and Geoffrey had already packed up the property, and left. Madame {{was talking to}} James Houghton. Louis and Max were busy together. Mr. <b>May</b> <b>came</b> to Alvina.|$|R
60|$|Mr. <b>May</b> <b>came</b> in, {{and stayed}} for a dismal half-hour. Then Alvina {{went back to}} her nursing. The patient was no better, still unconscious. Miss Pinnegar came down, red eyed and sullen looking. The {{condition}} of James gave little room for hope.|$|R
