40|$|Non-contact imaging photoplethysmography is an {{exciting}} new field based {{on the principles of}} traditional photoplethysmography where viable signals can now be acquired without the use of contact equipment. Recent advances regarding non-contact imaging photoplethysmography have permitted a wide range of new possibilities focused on sensing the cardiopulmonary system. Physiological metrics such as pulse rate, respiration rate, and pulse rate variability can be obtained by current photoplethysmographic imaging methods. Although previous systems were challenged by head-motion artifacts, the mitigation of rigid head-motion artifacts has been demonstrated with a <b>multi-imager</b> design. This study investigated the feasibility and accuracy of pulse rate variability utilizing a <b>multi-imager</b> recording system. Parameters such as sampling rate, image resolution, and number of imagers utilized were examined in an attempt to minimize overall system data bandwidth. Accurate pulse rate variability metrics where found within the frequency and temporal domains, along with promising results regarding the aforementioned input parameters...|$|E

The {{enabling}} technologies of increasing PC bus bandwidth, multicore processors, and advanced graphics processors {{combined with a}} high-performance multi-image camera system are leading to new ways of considering video. We describe scalable varied-resolution video capture, presenting a novel method of generating multi-resolution dialable-shape panoramas, a line-based calibration method that achieves optimal <b>multi-imager</b> global registration across possibly disjoint views, and a technique for recasting mosaicking homographies for arbitrary planes. Results show synthesis of a 7. 5 megapixel (MP) video stream from 22 synchronized uncompressed imagers operating at 30 Hz on a single PC. ...|$|E

They also indicated that the Ps 6 onset coincided with the Pi 2 onset in the midnight sector and showed a linear time lag after the Pi 2 onset in the dawn and dusk sectors. Furthermore, Connors et al. (2003) provided several examples in which Ps 6 pulsations occurred at or very near the onset of a substorm expansion phase, a pseudo-breakup, or a poleward boundary intensification. Wild et al. (2011) also presented {{an example of}} omega bands observed just after substorm onset in the midnight sector, dawnward of the onset region. Considering these previous studies and the analogy between the EEASs and omega bands, we speculate that the EEASs {{may be related to}} the generation process of the omega bands, and quite a few omega bands observed in the recovery phase may originate in the eastward expansion of the auroral bulge. The faster eastward propagation of the EEASs (3 – 4  km/s) compared to the omega bands, resulting in a shorter period of the magnetic pulsations than that of Ps 6 pulsations, may be explained by the movement of eastward expansion fronts of the substorm current wedge. The difference in the ionospheric equivalent current between the EEASs and omega bands may be attributed to a large temporal variation in the surge structure, in which the distributions of the FACs and the ionospheric conductivity vary from moment to moment, in contrast to the more stable, well-defined wavy structure of omega bands. Unfortunately, we cannot confirm the abovementioned hypothesis because of a lack of data from global <b>multi-imager</b> networks as well as satellites. It is necessary to statistically analyze data from the large-scale <b>multi-imager</b> and multi-magnetometer networks such as the THEMIS GBO in order to clarify the spatiotemporal variation of the EEASs; this will be explored in future studies.|$|E
30|$|The {{samples were}} {{subjected}} to SDS-PAGE on a 10 or 12 % polyacrylamide gel with the Mini-protean II system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The total number of proteins on the SDS-PAGE gel was detected with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) R- 250. In the case of western blot, the proteins found in the gels were blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane using the Mini Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). After being blocked in 5 % skim milk in a Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1 % Tween 20 (TBST), the membrane was incubated in a 1 : 10000 diluted mouse anti-HPV 16 L 1 antibody (Novus Biologicals Inc. Littleton, CO, USA) for an hour. This antibody can also recognize HPV 6 b L 1 protein. The membrane was washed with TBST and then incubated in a 1 : 20000 diluted either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (GE Healthcare) for an hour. Detection was performed using ECL Plus Western Blotting Reagent (GE Healthcare). Specific bands were detected using a Fluor-S/MAX <b>Multi-Imager</b> (Bio-Rad). Protein band intensity was analyzed by Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).|$|E
40|$|The paper reports an {{important}} achievement in MRI instrumentation, a pneumatic, fully actuated robot {{located within the}} scanner alongside the patient and operating under remote control based on the images. Previous MRI robots commonly used piezoelectric actuation limiting their compatibility. Pneumatics is an ideal choice for MRI compatibility because it is decoupled from electromagnetism, but pneumatic actuators were hardly controllable. This achievement was possible due to a recent technology breakthrough, the invention of {{a new type of}} pneumatic motor, PneuStep (1), designed for the robot reported here with uncompromised MRI compatibility, high-precision, and medical safety. MrBot is one of the ‘‘MRI stealth’ ’ robots today (the second is described in this issue by Zangos et al.). Both of these systems are also <b>multi-imager</b> compatible, being able to operate with the imager of choice or cross-imaging modalities. For MRI compatibility the robot is exclusively constructed of nonmagnetic and dielectric materials such as plastics, ceramics, crystals, rubbers and is electricity free. Light-based encoding is used for feedback, so that all electric components are distally located outside the imager’s room. MRI robots are modern, digital medical instruments in line with advanced imaging equipment and methods. These allow for accessing patients within closed bore scanners and performing interventions under direct (in scanner) imaging feedback. MRI robots could allow e. g. to biopsy small lesions imaged with cutting edge cancer imaging methods, or precisely deploy localized therapy at cancer foci. Our robot is the first to show the feasibility of fully automated in-scanne...|$|E
40|$|Fractures {{within the}} {{producing}} reservoirs at McElroy Field {{could not be}} studied with the industry-provided 3 C 3 D seismic data used as a cost-sharing contribution in this study. The signal-to-noise character of the converted-SV data across the targeted reservoirs in these contributed data was not adequate for interpreting azimuth-dependent data effects. After illustrating the low signal quality of the converted-SV data at McElroy Field, the seismic portion of this report abandons the McElroy study site and defers to 3 C 3 D seismic data acquired across a different fractured carbonate reservoir system to illustrate how 3 C 3 D seismic data can provide useful information about fracture systems. Using these latter data, we illustrate how fast-S and slow-S data effects can be analyzed in the prestack domain to recognize fracture azimuth, and then demonstrate how fast-S and slow-S data volumes can be analyzed in the poststack domain to estimate fracture intensity. In the geologic portion of the report, we analyze published regional stress data near McElroy Field and numerous formation <b>multi-imager</b> (FMI) logs acquired across McElroy to develop possible fracture models for the McElroy system. Regional stress data imply a fracture orientation different from the orientations observed {{in most of the}} FMI logs. This report culminates Phase 2 of the study, ''Combining a New 3 -D Seismic S-Wave Propagation Analysis for Remote Fracture Detection with a Robust Subsurface Microfracture-Based Verification Technique''. Phase 3 will not be initiated because wells were to be drilled in Phase 3 of the project to verify the validity of fracture-orientation maps and fracture-intensity maps produced in Phase 2. Such maps cannot be made across McElroy Field because of the limitations of the available 3 C 3 D seismic data at the depth level of the reservoir target...|$|E
40|$|Background: Oral submucous {{fibrosis}} (OSF) may {{be considered}} a collagen metabolic disorder resulting from areca-nut alkaloid exposure and individual variation in collagen metabolism. Due {{to the complexity of}} OSF pathogenesis, it is important to elucidate independent and interactive effects of polymorphisms of collagen-related genes on OSF risk. Materials and Methods: This study is focused on seven polymorphisms (SNPs) of transforming growth factor-beta- 1 (TGF-beta- 1) gene in patients with oral submucous fibrosis (OSF), belonging to south Indian ethnic extraction. The mean age at presentation was 43. 9 years, range 23 - 72 years (n= 50, M:F ratio, 2. 6 : 1). DNA samples from 50 subjects of the same ethnic group and comparable demographic features who have had practiced the habit of areca-chewing of almost equal duration, but remained free of disease constituted the controls. All DNA samples were collected progressively and purified from peripheral blood employing standard protocols and tested for SNPs. They included two polymorphisms in the promoter region (C- 509 T and G- 800 A), three polymorphisms in exon- 1 (Arg 25 Pro(G 915 C), Leu 10 Pro(T 869 C), Glu 47 Gly(A 979 G) and two in 5 ͲUTR regions (C→T(rs 13306708) and G→A (rs 9282871). The extracted DNA samples along with the primers underwent PCR amplification and the genotypic and allelic frequencies were calculated. All calculations were performed using the SPSS software. The PCR products were purified and subsequently sequenced using Flour S™ <b>multi-imager</b> system (Biorad). The sequenced data were analyzed using the BioEdit sequence analysis software. Results: Out of the seven polymorphisms analyzed, six such as two in the promoter region, three in exon- 1 and one in 5 ¢UTR were found to have a " P" value above 0. 05 and hence were not significant. The C→T transition (rs 13306708) in the 5 ¢UTR region recorded a " P" value of 0. 03 on comparison and hence was found to be significant. The allelic frequencies for this C→T transition in patients were 68. 7 % C and 31. 2 % T (27 CC, 15 CT, 8 TT) and that in controls were 89. 5 % C and 10. 4 % T (42 CC, 6 CT, 2 TT). Conclusions: The polymorphism in 5 ¢UTR C-T in TGF beta 1 gene has a significant association with OSF, being a prime determinant in the pro-angiogenic pathway which has got direct bearing with the pathophysiology of the disease. The proximity of this polymorphism to the transcription site and the associated risk involved is discussed. King Saud Universit...|$|E
