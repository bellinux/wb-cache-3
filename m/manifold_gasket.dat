25|$|In 2008 Aston {{introduced}} an aftermarket dealer approved upgrade path {{for power and}} handling of the 4.3-litre variants that maintained the warranty with Aston. The power upgrade was The V8 Vantage Power Upgrade, creating a more potent version of the Aston Martin 4.3-litre engine {{with an increase in}} Peak power of 20bhp to 400bhp while peak torque is increased by 10Nm to 420Nm. This consists of the fitting of the following revised components; manifold assembly (painted Crackle Black), valved air box, right and left hand side vacuum hose assemblies, engine bay fuse box link lead (ECU to fuse box), throttle body to <b>manifold</b> <b>gasket,</b> intake <b>manifold</b> <b>gasket,</b> fuel injector to manifold seal, and a manifold badge.|$|E
25|$|DEX-COOL {{specifically}} {{has caused}} controversy. Litigation has linked it with intake <b>manifold</b> <b>gasket</b> failures in General Motors' (GM's) 3.1L and 3.4L engines, {{and with other}} failures in 3.8L and 4.3L engines. One of the anti-corrosion components presented as sodium or Potassium 2-ethylhexanoate and ethylhexanoic acid is incompatible with nylon 6,6 and silicone rubber, and is a known plasticizer. Class action lawsuits were registered in several states, and in Canada, {{to address some of}} these claims. The first of these to reach a decision was in Missouri, where a settlement was announced early in December 2007. Late in March 2008, GM agreed to compensate complainants in the remaining 49 states. GM (Motors Liquidation Company) filed for bankruptcy in 2009, which tied up the outstanding claims until a court determines who gets paid.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the mid-1990s}} to 2003 these engines had failure prone intake <b>manifold</b> <b>gaskets</b> which could cause coolant leakage often leading to engine failure. In 2002 a {{technical}} service bulletin (#02-06-01-014) was issued to recommend RTV sealand applied during gasket replacement. Another TSB was issued {{to change the}} design of replacement gaskets intended to remedy deterioration of the nylon/silicone material of the original gasket needed.|$|R
50|$|For the 1990 model year, all Blazers {{now had a}} {{standard}} rear wheel anti-lock braking system. A new electronic speedometer system, with a 6 digit odometer on the dashboard was also introduced for 1990, along with non-asbestos brake linings. A new brake warning light on the dashboard was also introduced for 1990. The Blazer body also used double sided, galvanized exterior sheet metal. A new option for 1990 was power mirrors. The 5.7-liter V-8 (L05) engine was improved for 1990 {{with the addition of}} improved oil control rings, a redesigned rear crankshaft seal, a new camshaft sprocket design, non-asbestos intake <b>manifold</b> <b>gaskets,</b> and heavy-duty intake valves.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the re-spacing of the {{cylinder}} bores, {{the cylinder}} head castings remained unchanged. As a result, the centrelines of the combustion chambers {{in the head}} no longer aligned precisely with the centrelines of the cylinders but this did not matter greatly as the combustion chamber diameters in the head were smaller than the cylinder diameters. The 3.8 and 4.2-litre cylinder heads and cams are therefore interchangeable. The 4.2-litre engine from the factory had unsmoothed steps between the inlet manifold and head, and the <b>manifold</b> <b>gaskets</b> were not a good match for the inlet ports. These engines therefore make excellent bases for some modification, achieving approx. [...] SAE net and increased torque merely by [...] "flowing" [...] the head.|$|R
50|$|The HT4100 was {{prone to}} failure of the intake <b>manifold</b> <b>gasket</b> due to {{scrubbing}} of the bi-metal interface, aluminum oil pump failure, cam bearing displacement, weak aluminum block castings and bolts pulling the aluminum threads from the block. It {{may not have been}} the most successful engine to sit under the hood of a Cadillac, but potential buyers were no more satisfied with the other two engines available at the time, the V8-6-4 and the Oldsmobile 5.7 L Diesel. Reliability issues soiled the reputation of the HT4100. As a result, the V8 Oldsmobile gas engines were a popular and straightforward conversion. Despite problems with the engines, Cadillac still had annual sales above 300,000 as late as 1986.|$|E

50|$|The Oldsmobile Cutlass {{name was}} revived in 1997 as a {{slightly}} upscale {{version of the}} mechanically identical fifth generation Chevrolet Malibu. The Cutlass did have a few minor differences. Visually, it had a split grille front fascia like other Oldsmobiles {{at the time and}} all red rear tail lamps. Mechanically, the V6 engine was the only engine offered. The 3100 V6 engine equipped to the Cutlass was one of GM's most produced engines, despite issues with failure of the Lower Intake <b>Manifold</b> <b>Gasket.</b> Failure of the gasket could lead to engine failure, as coolant sometimes contaminated the oil. Replacement of the plastic factory gaskets with OEM grade metal gaskets solved the problem. Option-wise, it offered leather seats, chrome wheels and more standard equipment on base models; like a split-folding rear seat and power locks. This generation of Cutlass was intended as a placeholder model to fill the gap left by the discontinuation of the Ciera, before the all-new Alero arrived. Production of this generation of Cutlass ended July 2, 1999, making it the final vehicle to bear the Cutlass name.|$|E
2500|$|Milt Schornack joined Royal Pontiac {{and helped}} improve the {{performance}} enhancement package. The {{components of the}} kit varied, but generally included parts to modify the spark advance of the distributor, limiting spark advance to 34–36° at no more than 3,000rpm (advancing the timing at high rpm for increased power), a thinner copper head gasket to raise compression to about 11.23:1, special intake <b>manifold</b> <b>gaskets</b> to block the heat riser to the carburetor (keeping it cooler), larger carburetor jets, and locking rocker nuts to hold the hydraulic valve lifters at their maximum point of adjustment, allowing the engine to rev higher without [...] "floating" [...] the valves. Properly installed, the kit could add between 30 and 50 horsepower (20–40kW), although it required high-octane superpremium gasoline of over 100 octane to avoid spark knock with the higher compression and advanced timing. Adhesive [...] "Royal Bobcats" [...] stickers were also included.|$|R
50|$|The Early fuel {{evaporator}} is {{a device}} {{found in some}} internal combustion engines with carburetors. It can sometimes {{be referred to as}} an Electronic fuel evaporator. The device on a car, commonly referred to as an EFE heater is located between the throttle body of the carburetor and the intake <b>manifold</b> as a <b>gasket</b> and contains a resistance grid that heats the air/fuel mixture. The purpose of the EFE heater is to aid with vaporization of fuel in cold conditions, as well as to reduce exhaust emissions by running for about two minutes to allow for leaner choke calibrations. Photo shown below is of a USED, most likely defective, EFE Grid Gasket. Most common manufacture was Sylvania. Sylvania model 515853 is used on the 84 Buick Century Limited 3.0L 2 Barrel gas engine.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "short block" [...] of {{the engine}} {{is the same as}} other Land Rover 4.6 HSE models. Short-blocks used for the 4.6L Callaway engines were stamped with a 9.60:1 {{compression}} ratio marking from Land Rover. The increase of 0.25 points, up from the standard 4.6L compression ratio of 9.35:1 was achieved by a modification to the cylinder heads. The cylinder heads were also modified to improve the airflow {{into and out of the}} combustion chambers. The inlet <b>manifold</b> <b>gasket</b> front valley clamp has been changed to accommodate the heater hose positioning on the bottom front of the Callaway manifold. The ram pipe housing has been modified by shortening the ram pipe tube lengths. The intake runner lengths were tuned to increase both power and torque. The black plastic air inlet tube was replaced with a larger diameter fancy looking carbon fiber inlet tube to match the larger throttle bore in the plenum. The air cleaner box base was modified to increase the airflow. The Lucas GEMS ECU was calibrated to support the mechanical changes to the Callaway engine (the Callaway engine had the same basic FI as in 1998 and did not have the Bosch system that was on other 1999 HSEs).|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{a method of}} {{identifying}} faults in a small four cylinder, four stroke, normally aspirated HSDI diesel engine, type Lister-Petter 4 X 90, using acoustic emission (AE) was investigated. The study was confined to injector faults and leakage of the exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>gasket</b> although the findings could, in principle, be applied to other types of fluid-mechanical malfunction. Simultaneous measurements of AE, cylinder no. 1 pressure and needle lift, crankshaft speed and torque were acquired {{for a range of}} speeds and loads. Using features extracted from the raw AE signal, wavelet transformation and statistical techniques it has been shown, that AE can identify these faults over a range of engine operating conditions. The advantage of using AE over more traditional methods is that the non-intrusive nature of the sensors can result in reduced set up times and therefore cost. Engine condition can {{have a significant effect on}} combustion quality in a diesel engine which in turn can compromise engine performance. As a result there have been man...|$|E
