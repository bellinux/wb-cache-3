5|$|For the 2009 remake, {{stuntman}} Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of makeup special effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Mears's pleasant demeanor had the studio worried {{about his ability to}} portray such a menacing character on screen, but Mears assured them {{he would be able to}} perform the role. When Mears auditioned for the role he was asked why they should hire an actor over just another guy in a mask. As Mears explained, portraying Jason is similar to Greek mask work, where the <b>mask</b> <b>and</b> the actor are two separate entities, and, based on the scene, there will be various combinations of <b>mask</b> <b>and</b> actor in the performance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Differential Power Analysis (DPA) is a {{powerful}} side channel key recovery attack that efficiently breaks block ciphers implementations. In software, two main techniques are usually applied to thwart them: <b>masking</b> <b>and</b> operations shuffling. To benefit from {{the advantages of the}} two techniques, recent works have proposed to combine them. However, the schemes which have been designed until now only provide limited resistance levels and some advanced DPA attacks have turned out to break them. In this paper, we investigate the combination of <b>masking</b> <b>and</b> shuffling. We moreover extend the approach with the use of higher-order <b>masking</b> <b>and</b> we show that it enables to significantly improve the security level of such a scheme. We first conduct a theoretical analysis in which the efficiency of advanced DPA attacks targeting <b>masking</b> <b>and</b> shuffling is quantified. Based on this analysis, we design a generic scheme combining higher-order <b>masking</b> <b>and</b> shuffling. This scheme is scalable and its security parameters can be chosen according to any desired resistance level. As an illustration, we apply it to protect a software implementation of AES for which we give several security/efficiency trade-offs. ...|$|R
