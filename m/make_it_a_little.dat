I'd rather use what I've learned on the next one, and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit better. The worst of it is that I'm no longer a kid and I'm just now getting to be a good writer. Just now.|$|E
500|$|Cohn and Levithan {{had written}} the novel in {{alternating}} chapters: Cohn writing from Norah's perspective and Levithan writing from Nick's perspective. Cera and Dennings recorded voice-over narration to mimic the first-person perspective from which the novel is written, but the voice-overs {{were not included in}} the final cut of the film. Scafaria says that the differences between the novel and the film were [...] "to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more cinematic". She said that Nick and Norah's parents were written out of the script [...] "to absorb what it's like to be young, [...] you're not thinking about your parents when you're out all night". In addition to searching for Where's Fluffy?, Sollett felt that the film needed a second MacGuffin to propel the story forwards, so Norah's best friend Caroline got drunk and then lost, giving Nick and Norah an additional objective.|$|E
500|$|Holley auditioned {{to become}} a {{featured}} vocalist on the American reality television show Dancing with the Stars. The audition consisted of him performing seven different sounds, ranging from Frank Sinatra to Sly Stone. He was successful and became a featured singer {{during the first three}} seasons of the series. Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not a new experience for him. [...] "I've been at sessions where a producer has said he wants me to sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time. I've had people say can you <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more green. Huh? It's tricky." [...] He added, [...] "Sometimes they think they want Sheryl Crow, because she has a hit single. But what they really want is magic, and that is whatever you, as an individual, can bring. It's a tough call between being a blank slate and being yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{was always}} the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we {{finished}} writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand, and that inspired Mariah {{to come up with the}} melodic [...] 'I don't want a lot for Christmas.' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.|$|E
500|$|Barker's drum {{track was}} labeled by Drummerworld as [...] "one {{of the most}} {{creative}} beats of his career," [...] and mainly consists of the same basic beat repeated in sections throughout the verses. The first measure begins with the kick drum and splash cymbal playing on the downbeat, followed by a hit on the bell of the ride cymbal on beat two, preceding an open hi-hat that rings out for a full count on beat three. [...] "The kick, snare, and floor tom are all hit simultaneously on beat four, followed by floor tom hits on the last two sixteenth-note triplets of beat four." [...] The snare is hit on beats two and four, respectively. The song [...] "gradually builds to a powerful, piano-laden crescendo," [...] and the song's final chorus and conclusion take a more uplifting view of the world: [...] "Tomorrow holds such better days / Days when I can still feel alive/ When I can't wait to get outside." [...] DeLonge noted that over six guitar parts were recorded for the [...] "gigantic, sad" [...] choruses, but upon mixing, only four were used. [...] "The extra ones didn't really do anything besides <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more unclear what was going on." ...|$|E
500|$|The Queen {{was also}} the first {{character}} to meet death in a Disney film. As part of elimination of the original story's more gruesome aspects, and to make Snow White seem more a [...] "nice girl", the Wicked Queen is no longer cannibalistic and her destruction was made [...] "just as certain but more merciful" [...] than in the original story, where she is forced to dance to her death in red-hot iron shoes on her feet as an invited guest at Snow White's wedding. Snow White's role in the Queen's demise is removed, and the Queen [...] "dies more neatly and quickly," [...] as justice is served without resorting to killing or torture. She also invites her own downfall while pushing the boulder, and her fate is only suggested rather than shown. One of the Witch's animators was Ward Kimball, whom Walt Disney also let to draw the two vultures watching her fall [...] "to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> easier" [...] for him, as Kimball has been reassigned after his own sequence was cut from the film, since Disney thought these additional dwarfs gag scenes would distract from [...] "the real drama" [...] of the tension between Snow White and her wicked stepmother that was supposed to drive the film.|$|E

500|$|During {{production}} of [...] and At World's End, writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio discovered Tim Powers' 1987 novel On Stranger Tides, which they considered a good {{foundation on which}} to base [...] "a new chapter" [...] in the Pirates series. Disney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007. Rossio stated that he and Elliot had considered using Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth in the story before reading the book, [...] "but whenever you say those words, Powers' novel comes to mind. There was no way we could work in that field without going into territory Tim had explored." [...] However, they denied {{that it would be a}} straight version of the novel: [...] "Blackbeard came from the book, and in the book there is a daughter character, too. But Jack Sparrow is not in the book, nor is Barbossa. So I wouldn't call this an adaptation." [...] Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film, [...] "kind of a James Bond sort of thing", instead of the [...] "designed to be a trilogy" [...] structure of the previous installments. They hoped to [...] "design a story that would support new characters," [...] as characters such as Will Turner would not return. Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to [...] "streamline the story a little bit, <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> simpler and not have as many characters to follow", as the number of characters and subplots in At World's End caused the film to have an unwieldy length. The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded in the previous episodes: mermaids, which are briefly referenced in the book. The mermaids' role expanded in the script, which included a vast attack sequence.|$|E

We wanted to have some comedy in there and I wanted to do some animation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{most notable}} {{of these was}} Neofytos Vamvas, head of the School of Philosophy, and later Dean, of the University of Athens. [...] (Despite his high reputation, he had been {{considered}} too 'radical' for the School of Theology.) [...] Vamvas had been a close friend and follower of Korais in Paris, {{and over the years}} 1831–50 he led a small team of scholars in producing a translation of the Old and New Testaments into the 'Pan-Hellenic' katharevousa of the time — certainly not the spoken language, but close enough to it, it was hoped, to influence everyday speech and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more like Ancient Greek.|$|E
5000|$|Spicy {{brown mustard}} is also {{commonly}} used in the United States. The seeds are coarsely ground, giving <b>it</b> <b>a</b> speckled brownish-yellow appearance. In general, it is spicier than American mustard. Some [...] "Deli-style" [...] mustard incorporates horseradish which actually <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> spicier than spicy brown. A variety popular in Louisiana is called Creole mustard. Typically Creole mustard is much coarser than Spicy Brown.|$|R

These numbers have been printed on them long ago, during their days as part of the Lyemun Barracks. Some buildings however, have stripped off and removed these numbers, and that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more difficult to identify them.|$|R
30|$|Three of the CAB respondents, however, {{viewed the}} {{collaboration}} between the county and the national level as being somewhat complicated, relating perhaps to aspects of academic background and professional culture. One noted: “There are different schools involved […] I guess <b>it’s</b> <b>a</b> functional personal thing that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> hard to get things going sometimes.” No specific strategy currently exists for the avoidance of potential problems relating to knowledge views and academic backgrounds.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to the show's broadcast, it {{was stated}} that the set for the show, {{designed}} by the same designer of Conan's previous sets, John Shaffner, would be inspired by The Legally Prohibited Tour, adopting more of a [...] "theatre" [...] appearance than the previous shows. Shaffner commented on {{the choice of the}} show's chair, stating, [...] "You find one that you like and then you build it yourself to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shallower and a little more upright and the cushion a little firmer [...] But not too firm or every time the guest sits down they’ll say, 'Oooh this is a hard chair.'" [...] The rest of the set has been described as being [...] "filled with warm wood tones and electric blue screens," [...] and has been compared to the set of his most recent stint on The Tonight Show. The new set features several differences, however, including a remote-controlled moon, and the backdrop being transformed into a giant blue ocean. [...] In keeping with a change made during The Tonight Show, Andy Richter joins O'Brien during celebrity interviews on the main set rather than remaining behind a lectern after the monologue.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} recurrent {{neural networks}} (RNNs), which have attracted great attention on sequential tasks, such as handwriting recognition, speech recognition and image to text. However, compared to general feedforward neural networks, RNNs have feedback loops, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{hard to understand}} the backpropagation step. Thus, we focus on basics, especially the error backpropagation to compute gradients with respect to model parameters. Further, we go into detail on how error backpropagation algorithm is applied on long short-term memory (LSTM) by unfolding the memory unit. Comment: 9 page...|$|R

50|$|Another example: Force is {{dependent}} on the cross-sectional area of muscle (CSA), which is L2. If comparing force to a length, then the expected slope is 2.
