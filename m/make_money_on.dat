5|$|In 1972, Norsk Flytjeneste {{purchased}} two 50-passenger Douglas DC-6Bs from Braathens SAFE and leased {{one from}} Sterling Airways. They {{were used for}} domestic and international charter. The largest contract was from the Norwegian Church Aid, who contracted Norsk Flytjeneste to fly aid to Bangladesh. However, the airline failed to <b>make</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the DC-6s, mostly {{because of the high}} operating costs, and sold them after a year. The company followed up with purchasing a ten-seat Cessna Citation business jet that they offered in the charter market. However, the market was not large enough, and the jet was sold.|$|E
5|$|In Grenland, the {{metropolitan}} area surrounding Skien, {{there was a lot}} of opposition to the airline, and several local businesspeople claimed that it would be better if Norsk Air was awarded the contract, or Skien Airport was closed and locals instead used the nearby Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Norsk Air stated that it would not be possible for them to <b>make</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the Skien–Oslo route; despite that, it operated from Skien to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Stavanger Airport, Sola. In 1993, Norsk Air announced that it would no longer fly from Skien, and would focus all their operations at Sandefjord. Teddy Air subsequently took over the Stavanger route, while the Bergen route was granted to Air Stord, despite Teddy Air having applied for the concession. In 1994, the company had a revenue of NOK7.5 million, and a NOK1 million profit.|$|E

25|$|The {{increased}} number of flights caused expansion of the terminal, which opened in September 1999. However, after failing to <b>make</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the new route, Braathens {{pulled out of the}} Oslo service in November 1999. Braathens reduced its services to Bergen in January 2000, after which Coast Air responded by increasing its services. However, the airline closed the Aberdeen route the following year.|$|E
25|$|The {{private sector}} {{partners}} {{pulled out of}} the Plains Upgrader because upgrading heavy oil at that time was a risky financial proposition. To be economic, these projects rely on substantial differences in pricing ("differentials") between light and heavy crude oil. Heavy oil is worth less than light oil; the question is, How much less? Unless upgraded oil fetched considerably more per barrel than the less attractive heavy oil, the upgrader would not <b>make</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> processing the stuff.|$|E
25|$|Teddy Air was {{established}} in 1989 and began services from Skien to Fornebu the following year, initially using a Britten-Norman Islander. There {{was a lot of}} local opposition to the airline, and several local businesspeople claimed {{that it would be better}} if Norsk Air was awarded the contract, or Skien Airport was closed and locals instead used Sandefjord Airport. Norsk Air stated that it would not be possible for them to <b>make</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the Skien–Oslo route; Widerøe chose to operate out of Sandefjord and from 1993 closed its operations at Geiteryggen. Teddy Air subsequently took over the Stavanger route, using an Embraer 110, while the Bergen route was granted to Air Stord, despite Teddy Air having applied for the concession. Coast Air was also awarded a concession on the route to Bergen.|$|E

25|$|Each year {{billions of}} dollars of illegal {{gambling}} takes place in New Jersey. Illegal gambling operations range from employees who <b>make</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> office sports betting pools to online poker websites to multimillion-dollar enterprises run by organized criminals. Despite the availability of legal gambling in New Jersey, studies have shown that illegal gambling persists because it offers options that are not available legally (e.g., casino gambling outside of Atlantic City), and because some gamblers prefer using a bookmaker whom they personally know. State law does not punish players, but a person operating an illegal gambling enterprise, or possessing equipment or records used for illegal gambling can face up to five years' imprisonment depending on the quantity and size of the bets. However, illegal gambling arrests are rare in New Jersey, and there is presumption of non-incarceration for first-time offenders.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} took {{initiative to}} cover the costs to upgrade Stafsberg to allow scheduled services in 1985. Costing NOK800,000, The upgrades included upgrades to the tower and establishment of a terminal building. Widerøe was in August 1986 awarded a concession to operate flights from Hamar to Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen Airport, Flesland, using de Havilland Canada Twin Otters. The ministry simultaneously rejected a joint route application from Norsk Flytjeneste and Trønderfly. The route to Oslo and Bergen commenced on 12 November; after two months Widerøe stated that they were happy with the patronage to Bergen, but no to Oslo. Due to low patronage, the last flights to Oslo and Trondheim were carried out on 27 November 1987. At the same time the airline increased their services to Bergen. However, Widerøe terminated the Bergen route on 17 June 1988, citing that they were not able to <b>make</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the route.|$|E
25|$|From 1 April 2003 Norwegian Air Shuttle {{took over}} the route from Andenes to Bodø and Tromsø. However, they decided to {{terminate}} their operations with the Fokker 50, and thus also serving Andenes, to concentrate their efforts on becoming a low-cost carrier. From 1 January 2004 the route was served by Widerøe, who won the extraordinary tender. The state paid NOK68 million for 27 months, up 25 percent from the Norwegian bid, including a service from Tromsø to Lakselv Airport, Banak. The tender for the three years starting on 1 April 2006 was won by Coast Air, which used an ATR-42 on the route. Coast Air {{was not able to}} <b>make</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the route and abandoned the PSO contract from 1 April 2007. Widerøe won the subsequent tender and started flights from that date.

25|$|In 1791, {{during the}} French Revolution, many {{restrictions}} on theatres were removed. New laws allowed essentially anyone {{to open a}} theatre. Developers founded many new theatres, and it became increasingly difficult for any, including state sponsored theatres, to <b>make</b> <b>money.</b> <b>On</b> 8 June 1806 Napoleon issued a decree that regulated the opening of new theatres. No person could open a theatre without {{the approval of the}} emperor, based on a proposal prepared and submitted by the minister of the interior. On 25 April 1807 he enacted a second, more highly developed decree that determined the genres permitted at each theatre. Any theatre wanting to stage a work in the repertory of the state-supported Opéra, the Comédie-Française, or the Opéra-Comique had to pay a fee to the management of the appropriate company. In addition, only the Opéra could perform particular historical and mythological ballets, thus burdening several companies, particularly the Théâtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin.|$|E
25|$|Coleridge's and Southey's {{relationship}} dissolved, and Coleridge {{was without}} a close friend. However, he met William Wordsworth, a fellow poet, in September 1795 and would eventually become close with him. Their relationship {{did not yet}} start, and in January 1796 Coleridge was travelling to find subscribers for a proposed political magazine called The Watchman. During this time, he met with Erasmus Darwin and discussed both politics and religion; Darwin's atheism bothered Coleridge but he respected Darwin's philosophical views. He returned in February and The Watchman was first published on 1 March 1796 {{with the purpose of}} attacking the Gagging Acts. It was printed every 8 days, and the second on 9 March attacked the practice of Church-led fasting. The paper was soon discontinued on 13 May when Coleridge ran out of money to print it. The lack of funds was compounded by illness in Sara's family and the death of her brother-in-law. He was able to <b>make</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the publication of Poems on Various Subjects, 16 April 1796, and by giving lectures about Roman history.|$|E
25|$|Future {{contracts}} are another way our farmer can hedge his risk without {{a few of}} the risks that forward contracts have. Future {{contracts are}} similar to forward contracts except they are more standardized (i.e. each contract is the same quantity and date for everyone). These contracts trade on exchanges and are guaranteed through clearinghouses. Clearinghouses ensure that every contract is honored and they take the opposite side of every contract. Future contracts typically are more liquid than forward contracts and move with the market. Because of this, the farmer can minimize the risk he faces in the future through the selling of future contracts. Future contracts also differ from forward contracts in that delivery never happens. The exchanges and clearinghouses allow the buyer or seller to leave the contract early and cash out. So tying back into the farmer selling his wheat at a future date, he will sell short futures contracts for the amount that he predicts to harvest to protect against a price decrease. The current (spot) price of wheat and the price of the futures contracts for wheat converge as time gets closer to the delivery date, so in order to <b>make</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the hedge, the farmer must close out his position earlier than then. On the chance that prices decrease in the future, the farmer will make a profit on his short position in the futures market which offsets any decrease in revenues from the spot market for wheat. On the other hand, if prices increase, the farmer will generate a loss on the futures market which is offset by an increase in revenues on the spot market for wheat. Instead of agreeing to sell his wheat to one person on a set date, the farmer will just buy and sell futures on an exchange and then sell his wheat wherever he wants once he harvests it.|$|E

Next, Trump embarked on a two-day campaign stop in California, which the media covered extensively. [...] During the stop, Trump held a press conference, appearing with his campaign entourage that included his girlfriend Melania, Roger Stone, and bodyguard Matt Calamari. [...] Aides made hand sanitizer readily available for reporters, presumably due to Trump's alleged germaphobia. [...] The Associated Press (AP) noted that Trump [...] "made little attempt to appear statesman-like" [...] at the press conference with responses that seemed [...] "tailored more to entertain his listeners than establish his credibility." [...] In Burbank, Trump appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno where he attacked Buchanan as [...] "having a love affair with Adolf Hitler" [...] and discussed his upcoming book, The America We Deserve. [...] The Weekly Standard reported that though the release date was only a month away, the book had yet to be written. [...] After the Tonight Show appearance, Trump attended a meeting of one hundred Southern California Reform Party members, to whom he delivered a speech and answered questions. [...] Crowds cheered Trump when he discussed his opposition to NAFTA, but some were offended when he questioned the existence of a Reform Party platform and, after receiving a copy, left it on the podium when he exited. [...] On the final day, Trump visited the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance and walked through an exhibit of The Holocaust. [...] He delivered a speech and held another press conference at the museum atrium, where he denounced Buchanan's views on Nazis. [...] Afterwards, Trump boarded his jet for Long Beach. [...] During an on-jet interview, Trump placed his odds of waging a full-scale campaign at [...] "50/50," [...] but [...] "edging closer," [...] believing there to be a [...] "fervor" [...] among the public about his campaign. [...] The AP evaluated the California response as more [...] "warm" [...] than fervent, but described Trump's treatment as that of a [...] "high profile dignitary." [...] At Trump's final event, he spoke at a Tony Robbins motivational conference. [...] Robbins and Trump had made an agreement that would pay Trump $1 million for showing up at ten of Robbins' events. [...] Trump planned to make campaign stops to coincide with Robbins' shows, speculating that he [...] "could be the first presidential candidate to run and <b>make</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> it." [...] At the event, Trump received what the AP called a [...] "moderately enthusiastic applause" [...] after asking the 21,000 people in attendance whether he should run for president.
