5|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{chemical}} structure, {{and their effects}} in humans are mainly produced by the allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines.

5|$|Communication using surface-borne {{vibrational}} signals is {{more widespread}} among insects because of size constraints in producing air-borne sounds.

The <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> production of vibrational signals are just as diverse as those for producing sound in insects.|$|E
