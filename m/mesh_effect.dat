In this study, a nonlinear-conjugate-gradients-based algorithm, ModEM (Kelbert et al. 2014), was used for 3 -D inverse modeling. Two experiments were designed with two different meshes for the inversions: (1) an experiment designed to analyze the overall regional resistivity variations and the deeper structure (regional model) and (2) a second experiment focused on the shallower structure (down to first 10  km) with the stations {{in the vicinity of the}} NAF (NAF model). While the first experiment contains the frequency range of 160 – 0.001  Hz, shallower model only uses frequencies down to 0.035  Hz.

40|$|Convective {{boundary}} layer over urban area is rarely {{studied in the}} literature due to the technical difficulty of field observation and laboratory experiments. Whereas, the importance of its understanding to many applications is undeniable. Therefore, large-eddy simulation (LES) is employed to study the turbulent flow over idealized urban roughness under a range of convective conditions. Unlike many studies of buoyant instability with urban structures, this LES study simulates explicitly both the motions at roughness and boundary-layer scales, facilitating the analysis on the multi-scale processes that are important under convective condition. The near-wall region is divided into inertial sublayer (ISL) and roughness sublayer (RSL). This study focuses on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), which states that the flow in ISL is scaled by local height rather than {{boundary layer}} depth, and the flow properties in RSL under convective condition. It is found that MOST describes the LES results approximately well, which means the applicability of MOST over idealized urban roughness is basically supported by this study. However, unsatisfactory results at slightly unstable state and near ISL upper limit, and the sensitivity test of the MOST statistics on the domain horizontal dimensions, suggests that boundary layer eddies can modulate the ISL flow statistics. Therefore, MOST is not strictly valid and this explains why most MOST data of field studies are usually unsatisfactory. LES result shows that the flow statistics in RSL deviates from those predicted by MOST, but they {{are found to be}} different from those of vegetative roughness. It is found that <b>mesh</b> <b>effect</b> is important in the vicinity of roughness, but it does not influence the flow in ISL and above since the turbulent processes are ‘local’ under neutral condition and ‘top-down’ 2 under convective condition. The horizontal inhomogeneity of flow statistics in RSL are enhanced by buoyant instability, especially the flux statistics. Functional forms of mean velocity and temperature profiles are derived analytically from the proposed MOST functions and compared well with LES results. The calculated aerodynamic and temperature roughness lengths show an increasing trend with instability at strong convective condition, which is found to be due to the enhanced turbulence at roughness scale. Therefore, the convectional view that roughness lengths are only functions of roughness morphology is not valid. The turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) budget analysis shows that the local buoyant production is much weaker than the shear production and the transport terms are enhanced in convective condition. The wake production term explicitly calculated to be negative by LES, rather than positive documented in some field studies. The convective coherent structures are found to be multi-scaled and formed collectively near surface and the two-point correlation of vertical velocity fluctuation is non-local. Similar to vegetative roughness, the sweep-ejection pair eddy is also found above urban roughness. The results imply the enhanced turbulence near wall in convective condition is governed by a ‘top-down’ mechanism rather than a ‘local’ one, which invalidates the Townsend’s hypothesis, while momentum and heat are actually transported by different organized motions. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|O concreto é um {{material}} de comportamento quase-frágil na ruptura, desenvolvendo uma zona de processo de fratura relativamente grande na ponta de uma fissura principal, na qual ocorrem fenômenos complexos. Modelos de fratura discretos são adequados para estudar tais fenômenos. Neste contexto, o presente trabalho estuda diferentes modelos de fratura discreta em concreto simples, em situação de modo I puro e modo misto (modo I e modo II, simultaneamente) empregando dois modelos constitutivos da zona coesiva, um acoplado e outro desacoplado. Considerando que a malha de elementos finitos não é adaptada durante a análise, fissuras não coincidem exatamente com as superfícies reais de fratura, resultando em componentes de tração e corte nas interfaces coesivas da frente de fissuração, as quais também não coincidem com os valores reais. Tais componentes devem diminuir com a abertura da fissura. Neste trabalho é demonstrado que apenas o modelo acoplado é capaz de lidar com as componentes espúrias do vetor tensões, e que a variável-chave é o potencial plástico empregado na integração deste vetor. Os modelos apresentados são comprovados por estudos experimentais, no caso de fratura em modo I puro com testes de flexão de vigas a 3 pontos e no caso do modo misto com testes em viga com 1 entalhe e dois entalhes a 4 pontos, viga com entalhe excêntrico ensaiada a 3 pontos e placa com duplo entalhe. Parâmetros do modo II podem ser alterados em uma faixa grande sem alterar visivelmente os resultados, pelo menos nos exemplos testados. Por outro lado, a lei coesiva para metodologia das interfaces coesivas necessita de uma lei de pré e pós-pico. Para o pós-pico, três leis são utilizadas, a saber: lei linear, bi-linear e exponencial. A escolha da lei interfere tanto no comportamento de pós-pico, como no valor de carga máxima a ser alcançado. A região de pré-pico define aberturas e deslizamentos elásticos fictícios, porém necessários para metodologia das interfaces coesivas. Neste trabalho, uma equação é proposta para determinar a lei constitutiva de pré-pico, que elimina efeitos de malha tornando a análise objetiva. Plain concrete behaves as a quasi-brittle {{material in}} rupture, developing {{a relatively large}} process zone at the crack tip. Complex phenomena occur in this zone. Discrete fracture models are indicated to study such rupture process. In this context, the present work studies different plain concrete fracture models for mode I and mixed mode (coupled mode I and II) using two constitutive models for the cohesive zone: one is a coupled model {{and the other is}} uncoupled. Considering that the finite element mesh is not adapted during the analysis, cracks do not coincide exactly with the real fracture surfaces, resulting in components of the traction vector at the cohesive zone that are not coincident with the real values either. Such components must decrease with crack opening. In this work it is demonstrated that only the coupled model is able to deal with the spurious components of the traction vector and that the key variable in this regard is the plastic-potential used in the tractions integration. The presented models are verified by experimental tests. In the case of the pure mode I, threepoint beams are used {{and in the case of}} the mixed mode three-point and four-point beams as well as double-notched plates are used. Mode II parameters can be changed in a large range without a noticeable change in results, at least for the tested examples. On the other side, the cohesive law used in the methodology needs a pre-peak and a post-peak relation. For the postpeak, three different shapes are used: linear, bi-linear and exponential. The shape has influence in the overall post-peak behavior of the body, as well as in the peak loading reached. Pre-peak relation defines the fictitious elastic opening and the sliding necessary to complete the description of the cohesive interface methodology. In this work an equation is proposed for the pre-peak constitutive law that eliminates <b>mesh</b> <b>effect</b> problems, turning the analysis objective...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we develop methods based {{primarily}} {{on the work of}} Kuropatenko and Wilkins to improve the application of artificial viscosity in 3 D finite element method (FEM) codes. The primary goal is to obtain better shock predictions for hypervelocity impacts (HVI) and reduce the need for user calibration. We focus on examining factors such as geometric variability with respect to shock direction, dynamic adaptation to changes in compressibility in the shock front, and anisotropic compression in multi-dimensional formulations. We implement the methods in the Velodyne hydro-structural code and investigate the effects on shock propagation using a series of simple flyer impact test cases which cover a range of system responses including strong and weak shocks. Various initial mesh geometries are utilized to examine <b>mesh</b> <b>effects.</b> Energetic materials using the Ignition and Growth Reactive Burn (IGRB) equation of state (EOS) are also examined due to the rapid change in compressibility and energy density which occurs due to reaction. These rapid changes can lead to insufficient damping in artificial viscosity calculations and thus provide an effective test case. We employ the CTH hydrocode to evaluate baseline shock behavior. The regular, ordered mesh of CTH allows for a consistent and precise application of the artificial viscosity. Direct numerical comparisons are used rather than experimental data to eliminate uncertainty due to factors such as material characterizations, EOS models, and mesh resolution. We compare the CTH results against various FEM artificial viscosity implementations to evaluate performance.

A method known as Implicit Monte Carlo (IMC) is widely used among the scientific community to solve such problems; however, the slow convergence of Monte Carlo methods can result in exhaustion of computational resources and statistically inaccurate solutions for very complex simulations. Thus, methods must be developed to decrease the uncertainty in our results without exhausting our resources.
