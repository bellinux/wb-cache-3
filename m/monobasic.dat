5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, <b>monobasic,</b> sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E

50|$|One {{constituent}} {{member of}} the MSS family, the <b>monobasic</b> malonate:Na+ symporter of Malonomonas rubra, has been functionally and genetically characterized. It consists of two integral membrane proteins, MadL (129 aas; accession number O06931) and MadM (255 aas; accession number O06932) which exhibit 4 and 7 putative transmembrane spanners, respectively. The transporter is believed to catalyze the electroneutral reversible uptake of H+-malonate with one Na+, and both subunits {{have been shown to}} be essential for activity. There is a close two-subunit homologue in Pseudomonas putida, which is encoded within the malonate decarboxylase gene cluster of this organism. The NapA Na+/H+ antiporter of Enterococcus hirae (CPA2 family; TC #2.A.37) also appears to be distantly related to MadM.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dissociation}} of protons from {{oxalic acid}} proceeds in a stepwise manner as for other polyprotic acids. Loss {{of a single}} proton results in the monovalent hydrogenoxalate anion [...] A salt with this anion is sometimes called an acid oxalate, <b>monobasic</b> oxalate, or hydrogen oxalate. The equilibrium constant (Ka) for loss of the first proton is 5.37 × 10−2 (pKa = 1.27). The loss of the second proton, which yields the oxalate ion has an equilibrium constant of 5.25 × 10−5 (pKa = 4.28). These values imply, in solutions with neutral pH, no oxalic acid and only trace amounts of hydrogen oxalate exist. The literature is often unclear on the distinction between H2C2O4, , and , and the collection of species {{is referred to as}} oxalic acid.|$|E
