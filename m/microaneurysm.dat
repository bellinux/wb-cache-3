40|$|A novel {{method to}} {{identify}} the Diabetic retinopathy stages in human retinal image is proposed. Diabetic retinopathy is the dangerous eye disease cause the blindness in worldwide. The first manifestation of diabetic retinopathy is <b>microaneurysms.</b> They are appearing as small reddish dot in human retinal image. The number of <b>microaneurysms</b> is the important parameter used {{to identify the}} severity of the diabetic retinopathy. Hence the detection of <b>microaneurysms</b> in human retinal image is the major work to identify the stage of the disease. Early identification of <b>microaneurysms</b> can help to reduce the growth of diabetic retinopathy disease, which helps to reduce the incidence of blindness. The algorithm starts with the preprocessing stage, which are used as guidelines for the subsequent Image enhancement and <b>Microaneurysms</b> detection phases.

40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Microaneurysms</b> {{commonly}} {{are believed}} to be related causally to retinal thickening in diabetic retinopathy, especially by leaking. The hypothesis that thicker areas of retina in diabetic retinopathy have more <b>microaneurysms</b> per unit area than areas that are not as thick was tested. METHODS: Retinal thickness analysis was performed with a prototype instrument for 27 eyes of 27 diabetic patients and 22 normal eyes of 22 healthy subjects. Maps of retinal thickness were created, and <b>microaneurysms</b> were counted in zones having four levels of retinal thickness. RESULTS: There was no increase in either total <b>microaneurysms</b> or apparent leaking <b>microaneurysms</b> per unit area with increasing levels of retinal thickness (P = 0. 77 and 0. 87, respectively). CONCLUSION: Some <b>microaneurysms</b> may not cause thickening, or other factors may contribute to retinal thickening in diabetic retinopathy. The results may have implications on the pathogenesis of diabetic macular edema. Copyright © 2008 by the Ophthalmic Communication Society Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|This is {{followed}} by an exudative stage, {{in which there is}} disruption of the blood-retina barrier, necrosis of the smooth muscles and endothelial cells, exudation of blood and lipids, and retinal ischemia. These changes are manifested in the retina as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates, and cotton-wool spots. Swelling of the optic disk may occur at this time and usually indicates severely elevated blood pressure (i.e., malignant hypertension). Because better methods for the control of blood pressure are now available in the general population, malignant hypertension is rarely seen. In contrast, other retinal vascular complications of hypertension, such as macroaneurysms and branch-vein occlusions, are not uncommon in patients with chronically elevated blood pressure. These stages of hypertensive retinopathy however, may not be sequential. For example, signs of retinopathy that reflect the exudative stage, such as retinal hemorrhage or <b>microaneurysm,</b> may be seen in eyes that do not have features of the sclerotic stage, The exudative signs are nonspecific, since they are seen in diabetes and other conditions.|$|E

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To {{determine}} whether <b>microaneurysms,</b> {{in the absence}} of other lesions, have a predictive role in the progression of diabetic retinopathy in Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Retinal photographs taken at diagnosis in patients participating in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, and thereafter at 3 yearly intervals, were assessed using a modified Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy grading system for lesions of diabetic retinopathy and end points of vitreous haemorrhage and photocoagulation. The number of <b>microaneurysms</b> in each eye was recorded. RESULTS: The changes between diagnosis and later photographs were analysed in 2424 patients at 6 years, 1236 at 9 years and 414 at 12 years. Of the 2424 patients studied in the 6 year cohort 1809 had either no retinopathy or <b>microaneurysms</b> only at entry. In these patients the presence of <b>microaneurysms</b> alone and also the number of <b>microaneurysms</b> had a high predictive value for worsening retinopathy at 3, 6, 9, and 12 years after entry into the study (e. g. at 6 years chi(2) for trend = 75 on 1 df, p < 0. 001). The predictive value of {{the presence or absence of}} <b>microaneurysms</b> and their number at 3 years from diagnosis and subsequent worsening retinopathy was similar to that at entry.

We have proposed two subsystems for an automatic detection of <b>microaneurysms</b> in colour fundus images using the Circular Hough Transform method for the localisation of the <b>microaneurysms,</b> due to the capability of this method to detect circular shapes.

METHODS: Three fluorescein angiograms were taken at 1 year intervals during a 2 year follow up from 24 type 1 diabetics with mild background retinopathy. Microaneurysms were identified and localised twice from each angiogram using a computerised system for retrieval of the coordinates for each <b>microaneurysm.</b> Microaneurysms identified similarly in both sessions were then processed further to obtain rates of <b>microaneurysm</b> formation and disappearance, and <b>microaneurysm</b> count changes. RESULTS: In the whole material {{the total number of}} microaneurysms increased from 298 to 436 from baseline to 2 years. During the 2 year follow up 395 new microaneurysms formed and 258 microaneurysms disappeared. Of the microaneurysms present at baseline 174 (58 %) were still present at the 1 year and 142 (48 %) at the 2 year follow up.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Microaneurysms</b> {{are present}} in healthy old-age human retinas. However, to date, no age-related {{pathogenic}} mechanism has been implicated in their formation. Here, cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging and several age-related diseases, has been analyzed in the old-age human retina and in the retina of a progeric mouse. Methods: Retinas were obtained from 17 nondiabetic donors and from mice deficient in Bmi 1. Cellular senescence was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, senescent-associated β-galactosidase activity assay, Sudan black B staining, conventional transmission electron microscopy, and immunoelectronmicroscopy. Results: Neurons, but not neuroglia, and blood vessels undergo cellular senescence in the old-age human retina. The canonical senescence markers p 16, p 53, and p 21 were up-regulated and coexisted with apoptosis in old-age human <b>microaneurysms.</b> Senescent endothelial cells were discontinuously covered by fibronectin, and p 16 colocalized with the β 1 subunit of fibronectin receptor α 5 β 1 integrin under the endothelial cellular membrane, suggesting anoikis as a mechanism involved in endothelial cell apoptosis. In a progeric mouse model deficient in Bmi 1, where p 21 was overexpressed, the retinal blood vessels displayed an aging phenotype characterized by enlarged caveolae and lipofuscin accumulation. Although mouse retina is not prone to develop <b>microaneurysms,</b> Bmi 1 -deficient mice presented abundant retinal <b>microaneurysms.</b> Conclusions: Together, these results uncover cellular senescence as a player during the formation of <b>microaneurysms</b> in old-age human retinas...|$|R

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of the hypertensive intracerebral hematoma supposes rupture of a <b>microaneurysm</b> of a cerebral arteriole due to angionecrosis. Oneda 11 {{found that}} microaneurysms develop after fibrinoid degeneration of the arterial wall. As {{to the frequency}} and distribution of micro-aneurysms Oneda showed they were more frequent in the putamen, thalamus and caudate nucleus and rarely found in the globus pallidus. Matsuoka 6 found 120 microaneurysms on histological examination of serial sections of the brain. They were distributed as follows: 51. 7 % in the putamen, 21. 7 % in the thalamus, 12. 5 % in the pons and 4. 2 % in the pallidum. According to Cole 2 they are found more fre-quently in the putamen, globus pallidus and thalamus and less frequently in the caudate nucleus, internal capsule and subcortical white matter. Those reports help explain why in-tracerebral hemorrhages are found more frequently outside the internal capsule. The variation in {{the location of the}} hematoma in the anteroposterior direction was previously thought to be due to the difference in the hematoma extension. Now it is believed that this variation is due to the differences in the site of a <b>microaneurysm</b> which ruptures.

If a <b>microaneurysm</b> ruptures on the medial lenticulo-striate artery it then develops into the Anterior sub-type.
