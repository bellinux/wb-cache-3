25|$|The {{problem with}} the methods {{described}} above is that errors will accumulate and the series will tend to diverge from the true function. A solution which guarantees a constant <b>maximum</b> <b>error</b> is to use curve fitting. A minimum of N values are calculated evenly spaced along {{the range of the}} desired calculations. Using a curve fitting technique like Gaussian reduction an N1th degree polynomial interpolation of the function is found. With the optimized polynomial, the initial values can be calculated as above.|$|E
2500|$|The deferent-and-epicycle model {{had been}} used by Greek astronomers for centuries along {{with the idea of}} the {{eccentric}} (a deferent which is slightly off-center from the Earth), which was even older. In the illustration, the center of the deferent is not the Earth but the spot marked X, making it eccentric (from the Greek ἐκ ec- meaning [...] "from," [...] and κέντρον kentron meaning [...] "center"), from which the spot takes its name. Unfortunately, the system that was available in Ptolemy's time did not quite match observations, even though it was considerably improved over Hipparchus' system. Most noticeably the size of a planet's retrograde loop (especially that of Mars) would be smaller, and sometimes larger, than expected, resulting in positional errors of as much as 30 degrees. To alleviate the problem, Ptolemy developed the equant. The equant was a point near the center of a planet's orbit which, if you were to stand there and watch, the center of the planet's epicycle would always appear to move at uniform speed; all other locations would see non-uniform speed, like on the Earth. By using an equant, Ptolemy claimed to keep motion which was uniform and circular, although it departed from the Platonic ideal of uniform circular motion. [...] The resultant system, which eventually came to be widely accepted in the west, seems unwieldy to modern astronomers; each planet required an epicycle revolving on a deferent, offset by an equant which was different for each planet. It predicted various celestial motions, including {{the beginning and end of}} retrograde motion, to within a <b>maximum</b> <b>error</b> of 10 degrees, considerably better than without the equant.|$|E
