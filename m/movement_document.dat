5000|$|Wang Dan {{felt there}} were many things {{that could have been}} changed about the movement, and he has raised these issues, both during and after the movement. In an {{interview}} with The New York Times published 2 June 1989, Wang states, I think that the student movements in the future should be firmly based on something solid, such as the democratization of campus life or the realization of civil rights according to the Constitution,… Otherwise, the result is chaos. [...] Another issue Wang raises is the involvement of intellectuals in the movement, expressed in the Times interview as well as a 2008 interview titled “Tiananmen Remembered.” [...] In this source he believes that intellectuals were not used early enough in the movement, and their involvement may have changed the course of events. Despite pointing out failures, Wang feels the protests affected the mentality of many Chinese people, arguing the hunger strike was necessary as it allowed greater attention on the <b>movement.</b> (<b>Document</b> 1) In addition to this Wang feels that the crackdown, and the promotion of democracy got the attention of the entire nation, educating many people on democracy, a completely new idea for many Chinese people.|$|E

To investigate this situation, we conducted two participatory design workshops.

In the second workshop, on refining and communicating, designers proposed tools that could refine <b>movement,</b> <b>document</b> context through usage scenarios, and support the use of examples. In this workshop they struggled to effectively communicate their ideas for developers because their ideas had not been fully explored.

40|$|Recent {{literature}} in carceral geography has attended {{to the importance}} of mobilities in interrogating the experience and control of spaces of imprisonment, detention and confinement. Scholars have explored the paradoxical nature of incarcerated experience as individuals oscillate between moments of fixity and motion as they are transported to/from carceral environments. This paper draws upon the convict ship ? an example yet to gain attention within these emerging discussions ? which is both an exemplar of this paradox and a lens through which to complicate understandings of carceral (im) mobilities. The ship is a space of macro-movement from point A to B, whilst simultaneously a site of apparent confinement for those aboard who are unable to move beyond its physical parameters. Yet, we contend that all manner of mobilities permeate the internal space of the ship. Accordingly, we challenge the binary thinking that separates moments of fixity from motion and explore the constituent parts that shape movement. In paying attention to movements in motion on the ship, we argue that studies of carceral mobility must attend to both methods of moving in the space between points A and B; as micro, embodied and intimate (im) mobilities are also played out within large-scale regimes of <b>movement.</b> <b>Document</b> embargo until 23 / 08 / 2016. preprintPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{narratives}} {{of the civil}} rights <b>movement</b> <b>document</b> black veterans ’ contributions to the movement’s success, often attributing their efforts to their military experience. While this attribution makes sense intuitively, alternative explanations for black veterans ’ mobilization are not fully explored in existing work. For instance, black veterans were often among the most active members in many {{of the civil rights}} organizations from which insurgency was launched. Therefore, we cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} black civic institutions, not military service per se, drove black veterans ’ activism. Furthermore, if military service did lead to political activism, we lack a microlevel mechanism to explain the means by which it did so. In this article, I show that military service did motivate black veterans ’ activism independent of their membership in black civic institutions or feelings of group solidarity and theorize a mechanism by which it did so.

40|$|O presente estudo analisa o papel de movimentos de mulheres na área da saúde da mulher no Brasil durante a primeira metade da década de 1980, período em que havia, internacionalmente, um paradigma predominante do controle da natalidade e em que, internamente, lutava-se em busca dos direitos reprodutivos. Dois atores são destacados nesse processo: o governo federal, representado pelo Ministério da Saúde, e a sociedade civil, aqui representada pelo movimento de mulheres. A fim de entender, ainda que parcialmente, e mapear traços da dialética entre duas posições acerca da saúde da mulher foram selecionados dois textos: a Carta de Itapecerica, elaborada por mais de 70 grupos de mulheres, de 19 estados brasileiros, ligadas à área da saúde e que participaram do Primeiro Encontro Nacional de Saúde da Mulher, em outubro de 1984, e o pronunciamento do Ministro de Estado da Saúde do Brasil, Waldyr Mendes Arcoverde, na Cidade do México, em 6 de agosto de 1984, durante a abertura da Conferência Internacional sobre População, que aconteceu de 6 a 13 de agosto de 1984. Com base nesses dois eventos e em dois dos textos que deles resultaram, um deles representando o governo e o outro a sociedade civil, é utilizada a análise lexical, mapeando trechos que poderiam ser vinculados a discursos particulares tendo como base o documento do movimento social e o documento oficial do governo, no intuito de {{investigar}} se há discursos que se materializam nos dois documentos analisados, ou se os dois documentos recorrem a discursos distintos sobre o tema em foco. Como resultados da pesquisa, observamos a influência que o ambiente internacional exerceu no plano doméstico e a importância do protagonismo dos movimentos de mulheres na definição de políticas públicas. __________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe {{present study}} examines {{the role of}} women’s movements {{in the area of}} women's health, {{during the first half of}} eithties, a period when there was a prevailing internationally paradigm of birth control and internally struggled in accessing reproductive rights. Two actors are featured in this process, the federal government represented by the Ministry of Health and the social society by the women's movement. In order to understand, even though partially, and map dialectic trace between two positions on women's health, two texts were selected Chart of Itapecerica prepared by more than 70 women's groups from 19 Brazilian states, related with health who participated in the First National Meeting of Women's Health, in October 1984; and the statement of the Minister of Health of Brazil, Waldyr Mendes Arcoverde, in Mexico City, on August 6, 1984, during the opening of the International Conference on Population, held from 6 - 13 August 1984. Based on these two events, and in two texts resulted from them: one of them representing the government and the other the civil society, it is used the lexical analysis, mapping stretches that could be linked to particular discourses based on the social <b>movement</b> <b>document</b> and the official government document, in order to investigate whether there are speeches that materialize in the two documents analyzed, or if the two documents resort to different discourses on the subject in focus.

40|$|An optical {{displacement}} sensor using a pair type bundled fiber is investigated {{from both the}} theoretical and experiment perspectives. The theoretical analysis uses an electromagnetic Gaussian beam approach to determine a transfer function of the sensor. The displacement between a flat mirror and the bundled fiber end is measured using an intensity modulation technique. The sensor has two operating ranges with a good linearity; namely the front slope and back slope. On the front slope the sensitivities are obtained at 1. 71 and 1. 0 mW/mu m for the theoretical and experimental approaches respectively while on the back slope the sensitivities are 0. 38 and 0. 22 mW/mu m for theoretical and experimental approaches respectively. This discrepancy in theoretical and experimental values is due to neglecting the effect of Gaussian beam truncation in our simple theoretical model. The front slope is highly sensitive and useful for close distance targets while the back slope is less sensitive and useful for large displacement <b>movements.</b> <b>Document</b> Type: Articl...|$|R

The traffic generated due to <b>movements</b> of <b>documents</b> at runtime during load balance could also affect the performance of the DWS system. In this paper, we prove that minimizing such traffic in a DWS system is NP-hard. We propose several heuristic document distribution schemes that perform partial replication of a site's documents at selected server locations so that load balancing is maintained. We carry out simulation of these schemes using both a synthetic workload and real log data. From the simulation results, we find that using an additional 50 % of storage for replication, our heuristics can improve the load balancing performance in the DWS system by 48 %, and the internal traffic due to <b>movements</b> of <b>documents</b> has an negligible effect on the system's performance...|$|R
