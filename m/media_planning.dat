However, NPR station listenership is measured by Arbitron in both Diary and PPM (people meter) markets. NPR stations are frequently not included in [...] "summary level" [...] diary data used by most advertising agencies for <b>media</b> <b>planning.</b> Data on NPR listening can be accessed using [...] "respondent level" [...] diary data. Additionally, all radio stations (public and commercial) are treated equally within the PPM data sets making NPR station listenership data much more widely available to the <b>media</b> <b>planning</b> community. According to Arbitron's National Broadcast Audience Estimate report for September 29, 2011, NPR's signature morning news program, Morning Edition, is the network's most popular program, drawing 12.9 million listeners a week, with its afternoon newsmagazine, All Things Considered, a close second, with 12.2 million listeners a week. Arbitron data is also provided by Radio Research Consortium, a non-profit corporation which subscribes to the Arbitron service and distributes the data to NPR and other non-commercial stations and on its website.|$|E

The {{important role of}} social media is to quickly discover trends, extract structured insights to the marketplace and quantify perceptions of an organization’s products and services. Information about an organization’s products and services are easily accessed via social networks, blogs, tweets, videos, pictures, and numerous other online tools. When customers perceive that the information is positive, the organization can benefit with new and repeat sales. If, however, the information is negative, and the organization does not respond, the organization can suffer. In this paper, the authors define social media; discuss why it’s important to develop a social <b>media</b> <b>plan</b> that {{is embedded in the}} strategic fiber of the organization; as well as present how organizations are able to develop a customer-centric strategic social <b>media</b> <b>plan</b> and the impact of this plan on small and medium enterprises.

50|$|There is an {{apparent}} distinction between general marketing media buyers and direct response media buyers (DRMB). General market media buyers enact or actualize <b>media</b> <b>plans</b> {{drawn up by}} media planners. They negotiate rates and create media schedules based on a <b>media</b> <b>plan</b> constructed by a media planner. Through the media planner, general market media buyers rely on published cost per point guides. An experienced DRMB knows which stations generate a specific quantity of response and knows within reason, the break even point of the expenditure versus the return. With that information, the DRMB is efficient in negotiating a functional rate and in purchasing media from the appropriate stations. The DRMB attaches unique phone numbers to each station they purchase media from and track the sales, and make adjustments to the <b>media</b> <b>plan</b> and schedule as necessary to optimize results. DRMB can be short-form or long-form, although long-form is becoming increasingly unpopular. With these differing methodologies, direct response marketing {{can be considered a}} specialized arena.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} model to analyze the impact of {{advertising}} <b>media</b> <b>plans</b> and point-of-purchase marketing variables on a brand's market performance. Our model integrates brand choice, purchase incidence, and exposure behavior within a nonstationary stochastic framework. Moreover, it considers various aspects of consumer heterogeneity including individual differences in loyalty levels, purchase rates, and exposure probabilities for a population of consumers. The integrated model provides a relationship of advertising exposures from <b>media</b> <b>plans,</b> and other marketing variables, to measures of a brand's performance that include market share, penetration and depth of repeat patterns over time. In this paper, we focus on a multi-brand model formulation and stress its application {{to the analysis of}} advertising <b>media</b> <b>plans.</b> Based on single-source UPC scanner panel data for a frequently purchased product category, we provide an empirical test of the model.
