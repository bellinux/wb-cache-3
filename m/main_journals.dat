500|$|Data in the {{preprint}} archive is updated {{daily from}} the arXiv, the main repository {{of physics and}} astronomy preprints. [...] The advent of preprint servers has, like ADS, {{had a significant impact}} on the rate of astronomical research, as papers are often made available from preprint servers weeks or months before they are published in the journals. [...] The incorporation of preprints from the arXiv into ADS means that the search engine can return the most current research available, with the caveat that preprints may not have been peer reviewed or proofread to the required standard for publication in the <b>main</b> <b>journals.</b> [...] ADS's database links preprints with subsequently published articles wherever possible, so that citation and reference searches will return links to the journal article where the preprint was cited.|$|E
500|$|At first, {{the journal}} {{articles}} available via ADS were scanned bitmaps created {{from the paper}} journals, but from 1995 onwards, the Astrophysical Journal began to publish an on-line edition, soon followed by the other <b>main</b> <b>journals</b> such as Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. [...] ADS provided links to these electronic editions from their first appearance. [...] Since about 1995, the number of ADS users has doubled roughly every two years. [...] ADS now has agreements with almost all astronomical journals, who supply abstracts. Scanned articles from {{as far back as}} the early 19th century are available via the service, which now contains over eight million documents. [...] The service is distributed worldwide, with twelve mirror sites in twelve countries on five continents, with the database synchronized by means of weekly updates using rsync, a mirroring utility which allows updates to only the portions of the database which have changed. [...] All updates are triggered centrally, but they initiate scripts at the mirror sites which [...] "pull" [...] updated data from the main ADS servers.|$|E

As an {{introduction}} to the new journal we will be publishing a series of summaries of the topics to be covered, highlighting the most important papers in the field that have been published recently in the <b>main</b> <b>journal,</b> International Journal of Cardiology. This article describes a topic review of congenital heart disease. IJC {{has become one of the}} most important sources of quality papers in this field and many excellent publications have been published in the <b>main</b> <b>journal.</b> The expansion of space occasioned by the launch of IJC — Heart and Vessels will allow us to publish more high quality papers in the expanding field of congenital heart disease...|$|R

50|$|In the {{crankcase}} of {{a vehicle}} engine, motor oil lubricates rotating or sliding surfaces between the crankshaft journal bearings (main bearings and big-end bearings), and rods connecting the pistons to the crankshaft. The oil collects in an oil pan, or sump, {{at the bottom of}} the crankcase. In some small engines such as lawn mower engines, dippers on the bottoms of connecting rods dip into the oil at the bottom and splash it around the crankcase as needed to lubricate parts inside. In modern vehicle engines, the oil pump takes oil from the oil pan and sends it through the oil filter into oil galleries, from which the oil lubricates the main bearings holding the crankshaft up at the <b>main</b> <b>journals</b> and camshaft bearings operating the valves. In typical modern vehicles, oil pressure-fed from the oil galleries to the main bearings enters holes in the <b>main</b> <b>journals</b> of the crankshaft.|$|E
5000|$|First, {{and most}} important, the crankshaft's rod {{journals}} are physically {{farther from the}} <b>main</b> <b>journals</b> than on the original equipment. A given extension in {{the distance between the}} rod and <b>main</b> <b>journals</b> results in twice that distance in increase of piston travel. For example, in a Chrysler LA (1971-1992) 360 cubic inch (5.9 l) V8, the rod journal centerline is 1.79 in (4.55 cm) from the main journal centerline. The piston travels 3.58 in (9.1 cm) in this configuration. When this engine is modified with a 402 cubic inch (6.6 l) stroker kit, the distance between the main journal centerline and the rod journal centerline is increased to 2.00 in (5.08 cm), which results in the piston travelling 4.00 in (10.16 cm). So, the modified crankshaft with 0.21 in (0.53 cm) further distance between the main and rod journals results in 42 cubic inches (.7 [...] ) of displacement greater than the engine had before.|$|E

5000|$|Formed in 1985, {{the group}} {{originated}} in the Lisbon suburb of Amadora and had a largely youthful membership. Ideologically it rejected liberal democracy, party politics, communism and capitalism and took an ethnic nationalist view, calling for the defence of the Portuguese [...] "race" [...] against immigration and miscegenation. It produced two <b>main</b> <b>journals,</b> Accao and Ofensiva, {{as well as other}} more sporadic works that were designed to specifically appeal to members of the skinhead movement, which had become an underground fashion in Portugal around 1987.|$|E
50|$|A {{crankshaft}} is {{subjected to}} enormous stresses, potentially equivalent of several tonnes of force. The crankshaft {{is connected to the}} fly-wheel (used to smooth out shock and convert energy to torque), the engine block, using bearings on the <b>main</b> <b>journals,</b> and to the pistons via their respective con-rods. An engine loses up to 75% of its generated energy in the form of friction, noise and vibration in the crankcase and piston area. The remaining losses occur in the valvetrain (timing chains, belts, pulleys, camshafts, lobes, valves, seals etc.) heat and blow by.|$|E
5000|$|Ford's 5.9 L V12 {{version of}} its Duratec engine {{is used in the}} present Aston Martin lineup. [...] It is best thought of as two 3.0 L Duratec V6s mated end to end, albeit with {{slightly}} larger <b>main</b> <b>journals.</b> The regular Aston Martin V12 uses roller rockers (RFF), and was designed by Ford and Cosworth. [...] Cosworth assembled the V12 engines for a year before Aston Martin took over production. [...] However, Cosworth still casts the heads and blocks. [...] The variant used in the Aston Martin One-77 uses (DLC coated) DAMB cam followers like the later Duratec engines, and is built by Cosworth.|$|E

50|$|The major {{differences}} of the Buick 350 {{in comparison to}} other GM V8s are Buick's deep-skirt engine block construction, the use of cast iron with increased nickel content, {{the use of an}} external oil pump, a forward-mounted distributor, under-square cylinder bore sizing, 3 in crankshaft <b>main</b> <b>journals,</b> and 6.385 in connecting rods. The Buick 350 also shares an integrated aluminum timing cover, which incorporates the oil pump mechanisms as well, leaving the oil filter exposed to oncoming air for added cooling. The engine garnered a reputation as a rugged and durable engine , and some of the design characteristics of the Buick 350 are found in other Buick-designed GM engines such as the 231 CID L V6 and its 3800 descendants.|$|E
50|$|From these {{holes in}} the <b>main</b> <b>journals,</b> the oil moves through passageways inside the {{crankshaft}} to exit {{holes in the}} rod journals to lubricate the rod bearings and connecting rods. Some simpler designs relied on these rapidly moving parts to splash and lubricate the contacting surfaces between the piston rings and interior surfaces of the cylinders. However, in modern designs, there are also passageways through the rods which carry oil from the rod bearings to the rod-piston connections and lubricate the contacting surfaces between the piston rings and interior surfaces of the cylinders. This oil film {{also serves as a}} seal between the piston rings and cylinder walls to separate the combustion chamber in the cylinder head from the crankcase. The oil then drips back down into the oil pan.|$|E
