In order to meet the proposed objectives, a culture with a synthetic substratum (ethanol) was utilized. A <b>mineral</b> <b>membrane</b> with the following characteristics was used: a pore diameter of 0. 2 m m, 19 channels of a 4 mm diameter, a width of 0. 85 m, a filtering surface area of 0. 2 m 2, a pressure of 2 bar and a tangential velocity of 2 m/s. The experiments consisted of modifying the residence time of the substratum within the reactor. The following measurements were taken: chemical oxygen demand (COD), concentration of biomass and filtered flow. The results show a treated effluent of good quality, indicating that the time of hydraulic residence time influences the efficiency of the system and is influenced by the restriction of the filtered flow by a fast fouling of the membran...|$|E
40|$|Distillery {{effluent}} from sugarcane molasses {{leads to}} an environmental pollution due to its large volume {{and the presence of}} dark brown colored compounds, known as melanoidins. In this study, a bacterial consortium CONS 8 isolated from waterfall sediments in Maehongsorn province was selected as a molasses-decolorizing consortium. Consortium CONS 8 was able to decolorize, only within 2 days, in Erlenmeyer flasks, three different synthetic wastewaters containing either Viandox sauce (13. 5 % v/v), beet molasses wastewater (41. 5 % v/v) or sugarcane molasses wastewater (20 % v/v) at 9. 5, 8. 0 and 17. 5 %, respectively. Four predominant bacteria present in the consortium CONS 8 were identified by the 16 S rDNA analysis. To achieve the highest decolorization, the artificial bacterial consortium MMP 1 comprising Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia mercescens (T 2) and unknown bacterium DQ 817737 (T 4), was constructed. Under optimized conditions (aeration, pH), the bacterial consortium MMP 1 was able to decolorize the synthetic melanoidins-containing wastewater at 18. 3 % within 2 days. The comparison of decolorization by the consortium MMP 1 with abiotic control proved that the color removal for synthetic melanoidins-containing wastewater medium was mainly due to biotic activity of bacterial cells, without any adsorption phenomena. Supplement of nutrients and vitamin B did not promote melanoidins decolorization by bacterial consortium MMP 1. Finally, the performance of a membrane bioreactor (MBR) for synthetic melanoidins-containing wastewater treatment was investigated at laboratory scale, with a <b>mineral</b> <b>membrane.</b> The reactor seeding was made with the MMP 1 bacterial consortium inoculum. The reactor was performed with several hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 15, 20, and 40 hours. The performances were analyzed in terms of COD, color removal and biomass in the reactor. The results indicated that the higher COD and color removal efficiency were achieved with the longer HRT...|$|E

Here, commercial hydrophobic polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) membranes with a hydrophilic polyurethane surface layer (PU-PTFE) are used {{for the first time}} for direct contact MD (DCMD) on real poultry, fish, and bovine stick waters. Metal membrane microfiltration (MMF) was also used to capture fats prior to MD. Although the standard hydrophobic PTFE membranes failed rapidly, PU-PTFE membranes effectively processed all stick water samples to colourless permeate with sodium rejections > 99 %. Initial clean solution fluxes 5 – 6 L/m 2 /h declined to less than half during short 40 % water recovery tests for all stick water samples. Fish stick water uniquely showed reduced fouling and up to 78 % water recovery. Lost flux was easily restored by rinsing the membrane with clean water. MMF prior to MD removed 92 % of fats, facilitating superior MD performance. Differences in fouling between stick waters were attributed to temperature polarisation from higher melt temperature fats and relative proportions to proteins. Hydrophilic coated MD membranes are applicable to stick water processing but further studies should consider membrane cleaning and longer-term stability...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to widely used emulsification processes (high pressure homogenizers, rotor/ stator, etc.), emulsions {{can be made}} with <b>mineral</b> <b>membranes</b> in relatively low and controlled shear conditions. In this system, the dispersed phase permeates through membrane pores into the continuous phase circulating in the retentate loop. Droplets detach from the membrane owing to the shearing of the continuous phase. This process produces only a little heating, energy consumption is low. This is interesting both from economic and technological points of view, because it may limit the denaturation of macromolecular emulsifiers. The influence of some factors (membranes, working conditions, emulsifiers) on the droplet size of oil-water emulsions was studied. The sizes depended mainly on the adsorption speed of emulsifiers: emulsions were much finer with emulsifiers adsorbing quickly at the interface, such as SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) than with emulsifiers lowering the interfacial tension more slowly, such as β-casein or 11 S soya globulin. The membrane pore size, the shear rate at the membrane surface and, to a lesser extent, the volume fraction of the oil phase (between 0 and 30 %) had also a significant effect, unlike the oil flux. The emulsions were finer and more stable than those obtained in the same conditions with a rotor/stator system...|$|R

Although several studies aimed to identify operating conditions (e. g. juice pretreatment, crossflow filtration mode, etc.) to achieve acceptable performances, only few studies {{focused on the}} fouling propensity of fruit juices and on the identification of their foulant compounds. The aim of this work was to evaluate the fouling behavior of two orange juices {{and focused on the}} identification of relevant size-classes of foulant particles. Lab-scale filtration tests were carried out in conjunction with juice size-fractionation with the aim of quantifying the resistance to filtration of the juices. Based on a resistance-in-series approach, size-cartographies of foulant particles that are juice and membrane-specific were built. These cartographies were provided for two <b>mineral</b> <b>membranes</b> M 1. 2 and M 0. 2 with different average pore diameters (1. 2 and 0. 2 μm). M 1. 2 results showed that the fouling is mainly external for both juices and due to particles larger than 2 µm. In contrast, results concerning M 0. 2 filtration tests showed that four different size-classes of fruit juices compounds are involved in different fouling mechanisms. Moreover, the hydraulic reversibility of the fouling mechanisms was evaluated through the impact of shear rate on the measured resistances. It was seen that the fouling was mainly reversible when M 1. 2 was used for both juices filtration while it was not the case when juices were filtered with M 0. 2. This information would be interesting to choose the appropriate strategy in order to enhance the microfiltration of these juices at large scale. Moreover, the proposed size-cartography strategy would greatly satisfy the industrial demand for practical tool to identify the different size-classes of compounds governing the overall membrane fouling.

The outstanding problem is to ascertain how these factors exert their deleterious effects. Both compact and fibrous <b>minerals</b> inflict <b>membrane</b> damage, for which chemical mechanisms still leave uncertainty. A major weakness of cytotoxicity studies, even when lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species are considered, lies in tacitly assuming that membrane damage suffices to account for fibrogenesis, whereas the parallel occurrence of such manifestations does not necessarily imply causation. The two-phase procedure established that particles, both compact and fibrous, induce release of a macrophage factor that provokes fibroblasts into collagen synthesis. The amino acid composition of the macrophage fibrogenic factor was characterized and its intracellular action explained. Fibrous particles introduce complexities respecting type, durability, and dimensions. Asbestotic fibrosis is believed to depend on long fibers, but scrutiny of the evidence from experimental and human sources reveals that a role for short fibers needs to be entertained. Using the two-phase system, short fibers proved fibrogenic. Other mechanisms, agonistic and antagonistic, may participate. Growth factors may affect the fibroblast population and collagen production, with cytokines such as interleukin- 1 and tumor necrosis factor exerting control. Immune involvement is best regarded as an epiphenomenon. Downregulation of fibrogenesis may follow collagenase release from macrophages and fibroblasts, while augmented type II cell secretion of lipid can interfere with the macrophage-particle reaction...|$|R

Therefore, the marble processing wastewaters should not be disposed directly into the environment without a suitable treatment {{in order to prevent}} negative impacts and comply with the national legislations currently in force.

The goal of the research is to develop a treatment system for the separation of contaminants in low-organic Hanford tank wastes into various sub-groups that are relatively easy to treat further to yield products that are amenable to final disposal. The main target contaminants are Sr and Cs, although heavy metals and actinide-group elements are also targets.

40|$|Statistically {{designed}} {{experiments were}} conducted on a bench-scale ultrafiltration (UF) system using 10 kDa and 100 kDa polyethersulphone membranes to study the effect of operating conditions on membrane performance during whey processing. Experiments have underlined the importance of and provided {{a deeper understanding of}} factors influencing rejection. During filtration, a dynamic layer controlled protein fouling, reducing the effective molecular weight cut-off of the 100 kDa membrane and resulting in partial rejection. As pressure increases, the cake becomes denser allowing fewer and smaller passages for permeation, thereby increasing rejection of smaller solutes. Whey should be processed at high UF cross-flow velocities, relatively low transmembrane pressures, low feed concentrations and low temperatures. Low pressures help improve fractionation efficiency; high cross-flow velocities limit cake build-up and control cake thickness, thereby reducing specific cake resistance. Temperatures less than 10 °C and pH values away from the protein iso-electric point inhibit bacterial growth and are compatible with protein, <b>mineral</b> and <b>membrane</b> stability. An existing model of dairy UF plants enabled determination of factors that affect membrane age and operational measures that minimise the effect of ageing. No significant effect of ageing was observed on performance at different volume concentration ratios (VCR). Operation at VCR 37 and 38 was capable of producing 80 % whey protein concentrate (WPC). The effect of diafiltration water is improved when introduced over two loops with reallocation. Prevention of reallocation will dilute the total solids concentration in the retentate producing product that is out of specification. High protein rejections, lactose and ash rejection values between 5 - 15 %, and non-protein nitrogen rejections below 50 % are essential for producing 80 % WPC. Fat rejection did not influence product quality although experimental studies show that fat concentration in liquid whey affects performance. Flux was the most influential measure of membrane life. Membrane elements in loops 11 - 12 did not require as frequent replacement compared to elements in loops 5 - 7 which are most susceptible to ageing.

40|$|The pathway {{from simple}} abiotically made organic {{compounds}} to the molecular bricks of life, {{as we know}} it, is unknown. The most efficient geological abiotic route to organic compounds results from the aqueous dissolution of olivine, a reaction known as serpentinization (Sleep, N. H., et al. (2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101, 12818 – 12822). In addition to molecular hydrogen and a reducing environment, serpentinization reactions lead to high-pH alkaline brines that can become easily enriched in silica. Under these chemical conditions, the formation of self-assembled nanocrystalline mineral composites, namely silica/carbonate biomorphs and metal silicate hydrate (MSH) tubular membranes (silica gardens), is unavoidable (Kellermeier, M., et al. In Methods in Enzymology, Research Methods in Biomineralization Science (De Yoreo, J., Ed.) Vol. 532, pp 225 – 256, Academic Press, Burlington, MA). The osmotically driven membranous structures have remarkable catalytic properties that could be operating in the reducing organic-rich chemical pot in which they form. Among one-carbon compounds, formamide (NH 2 CHO) {{has been shown to}} trigger the formation of complex prebiotic molecules under mineral-driven catalytic conditions (Saladino, R., et al. (2001) Biorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 9, 1249 – 1253), proton irradiation (Saladino, R., et al. (2015) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 112, 2746 – 2755), and laser-induced dielectric breakdown (Ferus, M., et al. (2015) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 112, 657 – 662). Here, we show that MSH membranes are catalysts for the condensation of NH 2 CHO, yielding prebiotically relevant compounds, including carboxylic acids, amino acids, and nucleobases. Membranes formed by the reaction of alkaline (pH 12) sodium silicate solutions with MgSO 4 and Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 · 9 H 2 O show the highest efficiency, while reactions with CuCl 2 · 2 H 2 O, ZnCl 2, FeCl 2 · 4 H 2 O, and MnCl 2 · 4 H 2 O showed lower reactivities. The collections of compounds forming inside and outside the tubular membrane are clearly specific, demonstrating that the <b>mineral</b> self-assembled <b>membranes</b> at the same time create space compartmentalization and selective catalysis of the synthesis of relevant compounds.

The adsorbent choice was made on an Algerian bleaching ground: the bentonite available on the market with low cost. It has sorptives properties and ions exchange with specific area 250 m 2 g - 1. In the first step, we considered the organic matter adsorption on bentonite in static mode (jar test). The optimal conditions were determined corresponding to the best elimination of the Chemical Oxygen Demand with a final value equal to 30. 6 mg L - 1 and turbidity, in jar test with 1. 5 NTU value for an optimal bentonite concentration equal to 10 g L - 1. In the second step, the adsorption ultrafiltration coupling, showed a final value in COD equal to 9. 2 mg L - 1 and final turbidity equal to 1. 2 NTU. An improvement of the permeate flux was showed equal to 48. 8 % for the optimal concentration bentonite 10 g L - 1. The adsorption significantly improves the ultrafiltration performances...|$|R
40|$|Milk is a dilute aqueous {{dispersion}} with a complex mixture of proteins, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins and <b>minerals.</b> Milk <b>membrane</b> lipids {{are a part}} of the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), which covers the fat globules. During dairy processing membrane material is released and surface structure features are altered. The presence of free membrane material as well as various surfaces might influence various technical properties of relevance to the dairy industry. This thesis focuses therefore on the polar milk membrane lipids self-assembly structures in dispersions in oil-based emulsions, and their interactions with the major serum protein, beta-lactoglobulin and the major casein, beta-casein. The main polar membrane lipids of the MFGM are the zwitterionic lipids: phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and sphingomyelin (SM), and the anionic lipids: phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI). A higher PE content led to reversed hexagonal structures. At compositions resembling the MFGM a lamellar phase was determined. At this composition mainly unilamellar spherical vesicular structures were visualized using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM). Also bilamellar and multilamellar vesicles were present in addition of salt. Vesicles in cream showed facetted structures, in buttermilk and vitamized skim milk combined vesicle-emulsion aggregates were revealed. Deformed and tubular structures were observed at high PE content, close to the phase boundary of the lamellar to the reversed hexagonal phase. Combining a serum depletion method with radiolabelled proteins and Cryo-TEM interactions between membrane lipid vesicles and beta-casein or beta-lactoglobulin were investigated. At neutral pH and with a mild heat treatment low adsorbed amount of the proteins were observed, however an increase in adsorbed amount of beta-lactoglobulin and aggregation of the vesicles at lower pH was observed. Competitive adsorption between milk proteins and membrane lipids at the oil-water interface and how it depends on the formation of emulsions were investigated. Surface structures were described with different models. Adding vesicles to the protein emulsified emulsion led to adsorption / deposition of the vesicles at the oil-water interface. Furthermore, adding protein to a membrane lipid emulsified emulsion only a small amount of protein was adsorbed at the oil-water interface. Competitive adsorption at the oil-water interface was observed when beta-casein or beta-lactoglobulin was emulsified together with the membrane lipids. This study shows that the kinetics aspects can control the structures rather than the thermodynamic equilibrium, and that this may result in structures more complex than an adsorbed monolayer. Hence, it can be expected that procedures, such as the mixing order, during emulsion preparation is of crucial importance to the emulsification performance...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{lifetime}} of most reverse osmosis (RO) systems some fouling will adversely affect membrane performance. The major constituents of foulants found on the first position during six years of membrane autopsy at the Genesys Membrane laboratory are clay minerals chemically known as aluminosilicates. Clay is a naturally occurring material found in all RO feed waters composed primarily of different fine-grained minerals, which exhibit a degree of plasticity (deformation under pressure) depending {{on the amount of}} water held by polar attraction in the mineral crystalline structure. Clay deposits are difficult to remove with traditional specialty and commodity cleaning chemicals. This is due to the characteristic of plasticity, the presence of different structural cations and also the impermeability of clay to water. Clay deposits fouling the membrane rapidly reduce flux rates. In order to maintain product water output operators invariably increase feed pressure which compacts the deposit making it less porous and harder to penetrate with traditional cleaning chemicals. Ineffective deposit removal leads to more frequent cleaning and enhanced potential for <b>membrane</b> damage. Clay <b>mineral</b> fouling of <b>membranes</b> therefore requires immediate removal through effective cleaning. This paper explores the chemistry of clay and the mechanisms involved in membrane fouling. The process of developing and testing a new cleaning product Genesol 703 which removes clay deposits from RO/NF/UF systems is described. Comparative results with conventional cleaning products and commodity chemicals are presented. Product efficacy was determined by comparison of membrane flux rates before and after cleaning. The results demonstrate that Genesol 703 is a technically and economically viable cleaning chemical product for the removal of clay deposits from membranes...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{quite a number}} of {{investigations}} have been focused on the mechanisms by which acid deposition from the atmosphere is neutralized while passing through the upper horizons of a soil profile. A large number of studies investigated mineral dissolution rates in the laboratory including data from minerals present in soils. The soils of Central Europe mostly contain quartz, feldspar, illite, chlorite, kaolinite, various mixed layer minerals, and organic material. The dissolution kinetics of some of these minerals are well documented, but the applicability of the reaction rates, measured in the laboratory, to weathering processes in the field still represents a major gap in our knowledge (Hochella and White 1990, Stumm, 1990). Information about weathering processes in natural soil profiles are given by the composition of pore solutions, squeezed from samples of the upper soil horizons. They show low pH values and high concentrations of a number of cations and anions, in addition dissolved organic carbon (Schlabach, 1996). The solved components are certainly influ-enced by the atmospheric input and their interactions with the mineral phases. The input of acids into the upper part of soils leads to proton controlled reactive processes. These processes are rather complex including ion exchange, sorption, desorption, dissolu-tion, and precipitation, occuring either simulta-neously or in a certain succession. In order to understand theses complex weathering processes it is necessary to characterize and quantify the single processes.

40|$|Objectives : The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to evaluate clinically and radiographically the success and esthetic result of immediate implant placement {{at the time of}} extraction. Material and methods : Twelve patients with 14 titanium screw-shaped implants (13 – 16 [*]mm length and 4. 3 or 5 [*]mm diameters) were placed in the extraction sockets. Defects after implant placement were recorded, and then filled up with deproteinized bovine bone <b>mineral,</b> bioabsorbable collagen <b>membrane,</b> and absorbable pins. The defect was again re-evaluated at second-stage surgery. Clinical and radiographic parameters of the peri-implant conditions were assessed at the moment of prosthesis placement and at 1 -year follow-up. Results : The cumulative implant survival and success rate was 100 % after a 1 -year observation period. Analysis of the esthetic result showed that the mean pink esthetic score (PES) was 11. 1 (SD 1. 35) at 1 -year follow-up. At 1 year, 64. 3 % papillae had a score of 2 and the remaining 35. 7 % score 3 according to the Jemt (1997) papillary index. Optimal value of width of the keratinized mucosa was recorded in 13 (92. 9 %) implant cases in both periods of follow-up. At 1 -year follow-up, the linear distance between implant-shoulder to the bone peaks remains stable with a mean of 2. 62 ± 0. 2 [*]mm at the mesial and 2. 9 ± 0. 58 [*]mm at the distal aspect. Conclusion : Careful evaluation of potential extraction sites before immediate implant installation promotes optimal implant esthetics. To cite this article: Juodzbalys G, Wang H-L.

40|$|Capsule’’: A {{mixture of}} H 3 PO 4 and {{phosphate}} rock {{was effective in}} metal immobilization. To assess the efficiency of P-induced metal immobilization in soils, a pilot-scale field experiment was conducted at a metal con-taminated site located in central Florida. Phosphate was applied at a P/Pb molar ratio of 4. 0 with three treatments: 100 % of P from H 3 PO 4, 50 % of P from H 3 PO 4 + 50 % of P from Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2, and 50 % of P from H 3 PO 4 + 5 % phosphate rock in the soil. Approximately 1 year after P application, soil and plant samples were collected to determine mobility and bioavailability of selected metals (Pb, Zn, and Cu) using sequential extraction procedure and mineralogical characterization using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis. Phosphorus distribution and soil pH effects were also evaluated. Phosphate was more effective in transforming soil Pb (to 53 %) from the non-residual to the residual phase than soil Zn (to 15 %) and soil Cu (to 13 %). This was because Pb was immobilized by P via formation of an insoluble pyromorphite-like mineral in the surface and subsurface of the soil, whereas no phosphate mineral Zn or Cu was identified. While P amendment enhanced metal uptake in the roots of St. Augustine grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum), it significantly reduced metal translocation from root to shoot, especially Pb via formation of a pyromorphite-like <b>mineral</b> on the <b>membrane</b> surface of the root. A mixture of H 3 PO 4 and phosphate rock was effective in metal immobilization, with less soil pH reduction and less soluble P. Although H 3 PO 4 was effective in immobilizing Pb, its use {{should be limited to}} minimize soil pH reduction and potential eutrophication risk...|$|R

These deposits may result {{in a wide range of}} clinical manifestations depending upon their type, location, and the amount of deposition. Dialysis-related amyloidosis is a serious complication of long-term dialysis therapy and is characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils, principally composed of β 2 microglobulins (β 2 M), in the osteoarticular structures and viscera. Most of the β 2 M is eliminated through glomerular filtration and subsequent reabsorption and catabolism by the proximal tubules. As a consequence, the serum levels of β 2 M are inversely related to the glomerular filtration rate; therefore, in end-stage renal disease patients, β 2 M levels increase up to 60 -fold. Serum levels of β 2 M are also elevated in several pathological conditions such as chronic inflammation, liver disease, and above all, in renal dysfunction. Retention of amyloidogenic protein has been attributed to several factors including type of dialysis membrane, prolonged uremic state and/or decreased diuresis, advanced glycation end products, elevated levels of cytokines and dialysate. Dialysis treatment per se has been considered to be an inflammatory stimulus, inducing cytokine production (such as interleukin- 1, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 6) and complement activation. The released cytokines are thought to stimulate the synthesis and release of β 2 M by the macrophages and/or augment the expression of human leukocyte antigens (class I), increasing β 2 M expression. Residual renal function is probably the best determinant of β 2 M levels. Therefore, it has to be maintained as long as possible. In this article, we will focus our attention on the etiology of dialysis-related amyloidosis, its prevention, therapy, and future solutions.

40|$|Abstract 79 Se is a {{potentially}} mobile long-lived fission product, which {{may make a}} dominant contribution to the long-term radiation exposure resulting from deep geological disposal of radioactive waste. Its mobility is affected by sorption on minerals. Selenium sorption processes have been studied mainly by considering interaction with a single mineral surface. In the case of multi-component systems (e. g. soils), {{it is difficult to}} predict the radioelement behaviour only from the mineral constituents. This study contributes to the understanding of multi-component controls of Se concentrations towards predicting Se behaviour in soils after migration from a disposal site. This goal was approached by measuring selenite sorption on mono and multi-phase systems physically separated by dialysis membranes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, very few studies have used dialysis membranes to study the sorption competition of selenite between several mineral phases. Other workers have used this method to study the sorption of pesticides on montmorillonite in the presence of dissolved organic matter. Indeed, this method allows measurement of individual Kd in a system composed of several <b>mineral</b> phases. Dialysis <b>membranes</b> allowed (i) determination of the competition of two mineral phases for selenite sorption (ii) and determination of the role of humic acids (HAs) on selenite sorption in oxidising conditions. Experimental results at pH 7. 0 show an average Se(IV) sorption distribution coefficient (Kd) of approximately 125 and 9410 L kg− 1 for bentonite and goethite, respectively. The average Kd for goethite decreases to 613 L kg− 1 or 3215 L kg− 1 in the presence of bentonite or HA, respectively. For bentonite, the average Kd decreases slightly in the presence of goethite (60 L kg− 1) and remains unchanged in the presence of HA. The experimental data were successfully modelled with a surface complexation model using the PHREEQC geochemical code. The drastic decrease in Se(IV) sorption on goethite in a multi-phase system is attributed to competition with dissolved silica released by bentonite. As with Si the HA compete with Se for sorption sites on goethite...|$|R
