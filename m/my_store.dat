25|$|The famous Sioux leader Sitting Bull is {{connected}} to Willow Bunch through his relationship with Jean-Louis Légaré. Sitting Bull led the Sioux and the Cheyenne in the Battle of Little Bighorn against General Custer and the 7th Cavalry Regiment. After the battle, the Sioux retreated to Saskatchewan, settling in the Wood Mountain area. The first group of Sioux was sent as a scouting party. They crossed the border along Frenchman river below the present villages of Val Marie and Mankota. They arrived at Jean-Louis Légaré’s trading-post on November 17, 1876. “I was in <b>my</b> <b>store</b> with two of my men, when a dozen savages on horseback appeared.” They told Légaré they needed supplies and came to “sleep in peace.” Légaré gave them $30 in goods and they went away. The next day, they came back with seventy lodges and camped.|$|E
