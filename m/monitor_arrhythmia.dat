MethodsThis prospective, randomized single-center controlled study included 10 patients with established chronic transmural myocardial scars. Candidates for myocardial revascularization were randomly allocated into two treatment groups. In the control arm (n= 5), the revascularizable area was treated with CABG and the non-revascularizable area was left untouched. Patients in the AGTP-treated arm (n= 5) were treated with CABG and the non-revascularizable area was covered by a biological adipose graft. The primary endpoint was the appearance of adverse effects derived from the procedure including hospital admissions and death, and 24 -hour Holter <b>monitoring</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> at baseline, 1 week, and 3 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints of efficacy were assessed by cardiac MRI. FindingsNo differences in safety were observed between groups in terms of clinical or arrhythmic events. On follow-up MRI testing, participants in the AGTP-treated arm showed a borderline smaller left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV; p= 0. 09) and necrosis ratio (p= 0. 06) at 3 months but not at 12 months. The AGTP-treated patient with the largest necrotic area and most dilated chambers experienced a noted improvement in necrotic mass size (− 10. 8 %), and ventricular volumes (LVEDV: − 55. 2 mL and LVESV: − 37. 8 mL at one year follow-up) after inferior AGTP.

40|$|SUMMARY Computerized <b>arrhythmia</b> <b>monitors</b> {{recognize}} {{only a few}} of {{the significant}} arrhythmias and generally fail to detect arrhythmias of supraventricular origin. This is because conventional surface leads, which are sufficient for QRS recognition, are highly inadequate for automated P-wave detection. A new two-lead system, which includes a swallowable capsule-electrode for esophageal monitoring of atrial activity, is used in an on-line <b>arrhythmia</b> <b>monitor.</b> Three interval measurements (AA, AR and RR) and a QRS shape measurement provide the foundation for a detailed interpretation of each beat. Building on the single-beat analysis, a contextual diagnostic algorithm then recognizes and reports on-line the following arrhythmias: couplets, bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia with retrograde conduction to the atria, first-degree block, second-degree block, Wenckebach periodicity, advanced block, third-degree block and sinus bradycardia.

40|$|The {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) is a time-varying {{electrical signal}} that interprets the electrical {{activity of the}} heart. It is obtained by a non-invasive technique known as surface electromyography (EMG), used widely in hospitals. There are many clinical contexts in which ECGs are used, such as medical diagnosis, physiological therapy and <b>arrhythmia</b> <b>monitoring.</b> In medical diagnosis, medical conditions are interpreted by examining information and features in ECGs. Physiological therapy involves the control of {{some aspect of the}} physiological effort of a patient, {{such as the use of}} a pacemaker to regulate the beating of the heart. Moreover, <b>arrhythmia</b> <b>monitoring</b> involves observing and detecting life-threatening conditions, such as myocardial infarction or heart attacks, in a patient. ECG signals are usually corrupted with various types of unwanted interference such as muscle artifacts, electrode artifacts, power line noise and respiration interference, and are distorted in such a way that it can be difficult to perform medical diagnosis, physiological therapy or <b>arrhythmia</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Consequently signal processing on ECGs is required to remove noise and interference signals for successful clinical applications. Existing signal processing techniques can remove some of the noise in an ECG signal, but are typically inadequate for extraction of the weak ECG components contaminated with background noise and for retention of various subtle features in the ECG. For example, the noise from the EMG usually overlaps the fundamental ECG cardiac components in the frequency domain, in the range of 0. 01 Hz to 100 Hz. Simple filters are inadequate to remove noise which overlaps with ECG cardiac components. Sameni et al. have proposed a Bayesian filtering framework to resolve these problems, and this gives results which are clearly superior to the results obtained from application of conventional signal processing methods to ECG. However, a drawback of this Bayesian filtering framework is that it must run offline, and this of course is not desirable for clinical applications such as <b>arrhythmia</b> <b>monitoring</b> and physiological therapy, both of which re- quire online operation in near real-time. To resolve this problem, in this thesis we propose a dynamical model which permits the Bayesian filtering framework to function online. The framework with the proposed dynamical model has less than 4 % loss in performance compared to the previous (offline) version of the framework. The proposed dynamical model is based on theory from fixed-lag smoothing...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{see whether}} {{transient}} myocardial ischaemia on ambulatory monitoring after myocardial infarction {{is associated with}} ventricular arrhythmias. DESIGN [...] A prospective study. SETTING [...] The coronary care unit, general medical wards, and cardiorespiratory department of a major teaching hospital.

INTERVENTIONS [...] 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic <b>monitoring</b> for ventricular <b>arrhythmias</b> and ST depression both early (mean 6. 3 days after infarction, n = 201) and late (mean 38 days, n = 177). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Episodes of myocardial ischaemia were identified during ambulatory monitoring by transient ST depression of > or = 1. 0 mm lasting for > or = 30 s. Ventricular arrhythmias were single extrasystoles, couplets, or ventricular tachycardia. RESULTS [...] All ventricular arrhythmias were significantly more frequent in late than early <b>monitoring.</b> The <b>arrhythmias</b> included couplets (in 83 / 174 (48 %) v 49 / 200 (25 %) of patients, p = 0. 0000028) and ventricular tachycardia (29 / 174 (17 %) v 15 / 199 (8 %), p = 0. 0064). Patients with ST depression (29 early; 56 late), compared with those without ischaemia, did not experience {{a significant increase in}} single extrasystoles, couplets (31 % v 23 % early; 47 % v 48 % late), or ventricular tachycardia (3 % v 8 % early; 18 % v 16 % late).
