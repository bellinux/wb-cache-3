50|$|In 2006, {{an upgrade}} to the Central <b>Motorway</b> Junction saw ramps open between the Northern <b>Motorway</b> and the Northwestern <b>Motorway,</b> and the Northern <b>Motorway</b> and Grafton Gully. Beforehand, traffic {{travelling}} from the Northern <b>Motorway</b> to the Northwestern <b>Motorway</b> or Grafton Gully had to exit at Cook Street and travel through local city streets {{to connect to}} Waitakere or the Port of Auckland.|$|R
5|$|Póvoa de Varzim {{is served}} by a {{transportation}} network that employs maritime, aerial and terrestrial travel. The terrestrial access infrastructure is composed of national <b>motorways</b> (freeways), the national roads system, and light rail metro.

5|$|The A1 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system integrated with the A6 motorway as the two connect in the Bosiljevo2 interchange forming a unified toll system. Since the two <b>motorways</b> are operated by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb and Hrvatske autoceste, the toll collection system is operated jointly by the two operators. The toll is payable in Croatian kuna, euro, major credit and debit cards and using a number of prepaid toll collection systems including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operators and ENC – an electronic toll collection (ETC) which is shared at all <b>motorways</b> in Croatia (except the A2 motorway) and provides drivers use of dedicated lanes at toll plazas and a discounted toll rates.|$|E
5|$|The A1 {{north of}} the Bosiljevo2 {{interchange}} is operated by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb {{and the rest is}} operated by Hrvatske autoceste, both of which do not report company toll income separately for individual sections of various <b>motorways.</b> Total toll income reported by Hrvatske autoceste {{in the first half of}} 2011 was 508.1 million kuna (68.3 million euro). This figure pertains to the A1 south of the Bosiljevo2 interchange as well as all other <b>motorways</b> operated by Hrvatske autoceste, however the A1 represents the longest and the busiest tolled motorway operated by Hrvatske autoceste. Toll income reported by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb for the first half of 2011 is 191.2 million kuna (25.7 million euro). This sum includes company toll income generated elsewhere, however the A1 section represents the busiest section of the motorway network operated by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb. Hrvatske autoceste and Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb reported increase of the toll income compared to the same period of 2010 of 2.2% and 5% respectively.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, ramps were {{installed}} at the Central <b>Motorway</b> Junction to allow direct access between the Southern <b>Motorway</b> and the Northwestern <b>Motorway.</b> The following year, ramps opened between Grafton Gully and the Northwestern <b>Motorway,</b> allowing <b>motorway</b> traffic {{direct access to the}} eastern city centre and the port.|$|R

5|$|After {{reviewing}} {{traffic conditions}} in 1961, the Ministry of Transport planned {{to improve the}} North Circular Road to a higher capacity, grade separating as many junctions as possible, particularly those at important arterial routes. In the 1960s the Greater London Council developed the London Ringways Plan to construct a series of circular and radial <b>motorways</b> throughout London with the hope to ease traffic congestion in the central area. Under this plan the North Circular Road was to be improved to dual-carriageway standard throughout {{the majority of its}} length by the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|BINA Istra, {{the primary}} {{operator}} of the route, leases the type A, B, and C service areas to various operators through public tenders.
