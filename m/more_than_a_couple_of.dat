5|$|Thick as a Brick {{was viewed}} by some critics as Jethro Tull's first {{progressive}} rock album. The album has {{a variety of}} musical themes, time signature changes and tempo shifts – all of which were features of the progressive rock scene. Although the finished album runs as one continuous piece, it is made up of a medley of individual songs that run into each other, none of which individually lasts <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> minutes. Parts of the suite blend classical and folk music into the typical rock music framework.|$|E

25|$|Multiplying {{numbers to}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> decimal places by hand is tedious and error prone. Common {{logarithms}} were invented to simplify such calculations. The slide rule allowed numbers to be quickly multiplied to about three places of accuracy. Beginning {{in the early}} 20th century, mechanical calculators, such as the Marchant, automated multiplication of up to 10digit numbers. Modern electronic computers and calculators have greatly reduced the need for multiplication by hand.|$|E
25|$|In June 2004 {{the first}} {{performances}} for about 70 years {{took place in}} the theatre, first in its foyer then in July in the theatre itself. Although conditions were far from ideal, the audience was able to see the potential of this very large space – originally seating 3,000, it cannot currently be licensed for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred. It is intended that the theatre will one day reopen, but much costly restoration will be required first. It will never again reach a seating capacity of 3,000 (not least because one balcony was removed {{in the early part of}} the 20th century as a fire precaution, when films started to be shown there), but it does seem likely that a capacity of more than 1,000 may one day be achieved. A major season of the theatre company Complicite was planned for 2005 but the project, which would have included some repair and access work, was cancelled due to higher-than-anticipated costs.|$|E

25|$|After Coral Sea, the loaned pilots {{returned}} to VF-3. However, with Lexington sunk and VF-2 attached to Saratoga, VF-3 was now effectively homeless. In the interim it operated out of Pearl as a training unit. Jimmy Thach passed command to Butch O'Hare on 24 June 1942, making him CO, and O'Hare subsequently appointed Vorse as his Executive Officer (XO). Vorse wouldn't stay put <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks, however. The Navy {{was in the}} midst of a major reshuffling of fighter squadrons, including a move from twenty-seven to thirty-six plane squadrons as a standard complement. In the post-Midway milieu, fighter-starved air groups were actively recruiting from squadrons like O'Hare's VF-3. Champing at the bit to get back out to sea, Vorse took Capt. James M. Shoemaker up on an offer to join VF-6. Only 6 July 1942 Vorse was transferred; nine days later VF-6 would depart with USS Enterprise, a part of Task Force 16 under the command of Admiral Kinkaid.|$|E
25|$|While Hancock {{was in the}} Po sector, Warren {{requested}} {{permission from}} Meade to attack Laurel Hill at 4 p.m., uncoordinated {{with the rest of}} Grant's attack. Again the Laurel Hill line repulsed the Union troops with heavy losses. Grant was forced to postpone his 5 p.m. coordinated assault until Warren could get his troops reformed. Not informed of the delay, Brig. Gen. Gershom Mott of the II Corps moved his division forward at 5 p.m. toward the tip of the Mule Shoe. When his men reached the open field, Confederate artillery ripped them to shreds, and they retreated. At around 6 p.m., Col. Emory Upton led a group of 12 hand-picked regiments, about 5,000 men in four battle lines, against an identified weak point {{on the west side of}} the Mule Shoe. The plan was for Upton's men to rush across the open field without pausing to fire and reload, reaching the earthworks before the Confederates could fire <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> shots. The plan worked well initially, but Generals Lee and Ewell were quick to organize a vigorous counterattack with brigades from all sectors of the Mule Shoe. No Union supporting units arrived. Upton's men were driven out of the Confederate works, and he reluctantly ordered them to retreat.|$|E

500|$|When {{performed}} properly, deep frying {{does not}} make food excessively greasy, because the moisture in the food repels the oil. The hot oil heats the water within the food, steaming it; oil cannot go against the direction of this powerful flow because (due to its high temperature) the water vapor pushes the bubbles toward the surface. As long as the oil is hot enough and the food is not immersed in the oil for too long, oil penetration will be confined to the outer surface. Foods deep-fried at proper temperatures typically absorb [...] "no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> tablespoons per [...] cups of oil" [...] used.

500|$|The island's {{population}} numbered a {{few dozen}} families throughout the 18th century, corresponding to a population of no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred people; it was recorded as numbering 30 families in 1710, 47 in 1724, 40 in 1735 and 30 in 1760. They rented their land from two branches of the Sinclair family, the Sinclairs of Mey who owned Uppertown and the Sinclairs of Freswick who owned Nethertown. The latter acquired Nethertown in 1721 and eventually took possession of Uppertown as well by obtaining the wadset from the Kennedys, reportedly through skullduggery.

The island was reasonably profitable for the Sinclairs; in 1724 the islanders paid an annual rent of 1,300 marks (equivalent to about £125 at 2011 prices), part of which was paid in surplus grain ferried by Stroma's boats to the Sinclair granaries at Staxigoe near Wick.
