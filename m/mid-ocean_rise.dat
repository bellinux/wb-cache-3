40|$|A {{generalized}} image technique is described for modelling electromagnetic induction in two-dimensional systems, {{consisting of a}} thin (Price-type) ocean overlying a perfect conductor in the mantle. The method constructs a Greenâ€™s function for currents in the ocean by conformally mapping the perfect conductor boundary into a straight line. Examples are given that show the effects to be expected at an ocean-continent boundary with isotherms rising under the ocean, and at a <b>mid-ocean</b> <b>rise</b> where the high temperatures {{are believed to be}} quite shallow. 1...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Easter Island and Sala y Gomez {{are part}} of the Sala y Gomez Ridge, a broad band of high {{topography}} and scattered seamounts extending ESE from the East Pacific Rise. It has been proposed that the Sala y Gomez Ridge results from the movement of the Nazca Plate over a fixed melting spot in the mantle. To test this hypothesis volcanic rocks from Easter Island and Sala y Gomez were analyzed for their K-Ar ages and major element abundances. Subaerial Easter Island was constructed in three distinct episodes, occurring at 2. 5 m. y., 0. 9 m. y., and 0. 4 m. y. ago. The youngest rocks on the island are the Roiho olivine basalts, and are probably less than 50, 000 years old. Eruptive activity on Sala y Gomez was essentially contemporaneous with the early volcanism on Easter Island. No migration of volcanism with time is apparent along the Sala y Gomez Ridge, thus a major criterion of the melting spot hypothesis is not fulfilled. Volcanic rocks from Easter Island constitute a tholeiitic differentiation series; they are chemically similar to those from other islands situated near <b>mid-ocean</b> <b>rise</b> crests. The wide compositional spectrum is most likely the result of fractional crystallization from a basaltic parent liquid, though the data is ambiguous for the highly silicic differentiates. The youngest basalts possess more alkaline affinities which are probably not related to fractional crystallization from the earlier basalts. The alkaline nature of these rocks {{may be the result of}} a downward migration of the fusion zone with time, as the island moved eastward over a progressively thickening lithosphere. Volcanic rocks from Sala y Gomez belong to an alkali olivine basalt series. The fundamental chemical differences between the Easter Island and Sala y Gomez suites suggest that the two islands were not derived from a common source, as predicted by the melting spot hypothesis. The evidence does not support a melting spot origin for Easter Island, Sala y Gomez, and the Sala y Gomez Ridge. An alternative model involving diapiric intrusion and decompression melting of asthenosphere material along a major fracture in the Nazca Plate provides a better explanation for the data. Synchronous volcanism along the eastern extension of the Easter Island transform fault has given rise to the islands and seamounts on the Sala y Gomez Ridge...|$|E
40|$|The Mid-Atlantic ridge is a volcanically active rise {{that runs}} south from the Arctic through Iceland to near Antarctica. For some time, fresh flows of basaltic rock have {{appeared}} {{from the various}} fissures in ridge. Such flows have been frequently observed on Iceland and other islands along the ridge. At the mid-oceanic ridge, new basaltic ocean floor is created. At a few places the <b>mid-ocean</b> ridge <b>rises</b> above sea level, forming islands, such as Iceland, where basaltic volcanism can be observed. Iceland formed by volcanic activity on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in late Cenozoic time...|$|R
40|$|Hydrothermal venting {{associated}} with mid-ocean ridge volcanism is globally widespread. This venting {{is responsible for}} a dissolved iron flux to the ocean that is approximately equal to that {{associated with}} continental riverine runoff. For hydrothermal fluxes, {{it has long been}} assumed that most of the iron entering the oceans is precipitated in inorganic forms. However, the possibility of globally significant fluxes of iron escaping these mass precipitation events and entering open-ocean cycles is now being debated, and two recent studies suggest that dissolved organic ligands might influence the fate of hydrothermally vented metals. Here we present spectromicroscopic measurements of iron and carbon in hydrothermal plume particles at the East Pacific <b>Rise</b> <b>mid-ocean</b> ridge. We show that organic carbon-rich matrices, containing evenly dispersed iron(II) -rich materials, are pervasive in hydrothermal plume particles. The absence of discrete iron(II) particles suggests that the carbon and iron associate through sorption or complexation. We suggest that these carbon matrices stabilize iron(II) released from hydrothermal vents in the region, preventing its oxidation and/or precipitation as insoluble minerals. Our findings have implications for deep-sea biogeochemical cycling of iron, a widely recognized limiting nutrient in the oceans...|$|R
