25|$|The {{standard}} {{treatment for}} GPA is cyclophosphamide and high dose corticosteroids for remission induction and less toxic immunosuppressants like azathioprine, leflunomide, methotrexate or mycophenolate <b>mofetil.</b> Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole {{may also help}} prevent relapse. Rituximab may be substituted for cyclophosphamide in inducing remission.|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin has now {{replaced}} {{some of the}} azathioprine use due to {{a longer}} survival time, especially in heart-related transplantations. Moreover, despite being considerably more expensive, mycophenolate <b>mofetil</b> is also increasingly being used in place of azathioprine in organ transplantation, as it is associated with less bone marrow suppression, fewer opportunistic infections, and a lower incidence of acute rejection.|$|E
25|$|The acute uveitis {{phase of}} VKH is usually {{responsive}} to high-dose oral corticosteroids; parenteral administration {{is usually not}} required. However, ocular complications may require an subtenon or intravitreous injection of corticosteroids or bevacizumab. In refractory situations, other immunosuppressives such as cyclosporine, or tacrolimus, antimetabolites (azathioprine, mycophenolate <b>mofetil</b> or methotrexate), or biological agents such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or infliximab may be needed.|$|E
25|$|There is {{increasing}} use of immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate <b>mofetil</b> and azathioprine because of their effectiveness. In chronic refractory cases, where immune pathogenesis has been confirmed, the off-label use of the vinca alkaloid and chemotherapy agent vincristine may be attempted. However, vincristine has significant side effects and its use in treating ITP must be approached with caution, especially in children.|$|E
25|$|Sirolimus {{can also}} be used alone, or in {{conjunction}} with a calcineurin inhibitor (such as tacrolimus), and/or mycophenolate <b>mofetil,</b> to provide steroid-free immunosuppression regimens. Impaired wound healing and thrombocytopenia are a possible side effects of sirolimus; therefore, some transplant centers prefer not to use it immediately after the transplant operation, but instead administer it only after a period of weeks or months. Its optimal role in immunosuppression has not yet been determined, and it remains the subject of a number of ongoing clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{transplant}} rejection and subsequent damage to the new lung or lungs, patients must take a regimen of immunosuppressive drugs. Patients will normally {{have to take a}} combination of these medicines in order to combat the risk of rejection. This is a lifelong commitment, and must be strictly adhered to. The immunosuppressive regimen is begun just before or after surgery. Usually the regimen includes ciclosporin, azathioprine and corticosteroids, but as episodes of rejection may reoccur throughout a patient's life, the exact choices and dosages of immunosuppressants may have to be modified over time. Sometimes tacrolimus is given instead of ciclosporin and mycophenolate <b>mofetil</b> instead of azathioprine.|$|E
2500|$|Several other disease modifying therapies {{are being}} tried. [...] In 2007, Devic's disease was {{reported}} to be responsive to glatiramer acetate and to low-dose corticosteroids. Use of Mycophenolate <b>mofetil</b> is also currently under research.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cornerstone}} of therapy is reduction in immunosuppression. [...] A recent surge in BKVAN correlates {{with use of}} potent immunosuppressant drugs, such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate <b>mofetil</b> (MMF). [...] Studies have not shown any correlation between BKVAN and a single immunosuppressive agent but rather the overall immunosuppressive load.|$|E
2500|$|No {{controlled}} {{trials have}} established {{the effectiveness of}} treatments {{for the prevention of}} attacks. Many clinicians agree that [...] long term immunosuppression is required to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks, while others argue the exact opposite. [...] Commonly used immunosuppressant treatments include azathioprine (Imuran) plus prednisone, mycophenolate <b>mofetil</b> plus prednisone, mitoxantrone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and cyclophosphamide.|$|E
2500|$|Cyclophosphamide {{had been}} used in {{combination}} with anti-platelet/anticoagulants in unselected IgA nephropathy patients with conflicting results. Also, the side effect profile of this drug, including long term risk of malignancy and sterility, made it an unfavorable choice for use in young adults. However, one recent study, in a carefully selected high risk population of patients with declining GFR, showed that a combination of steroids and cyclophosphamide for the initial 3 months followed by azathioprine for a minimum of 2 years resulted in a significant preservation of renal function. Other agents such as mycophenolate <b>mofetil,</b> ciclosporin and mizoribine have also been tried with varying results.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{most other}} allografts, a liver {{transplant}} will be rejected by the recipient unless immunosuppressive drugs are used. [...] The immunosuppressive regimens for all solid organ transplants are fairly similar, {{and a variety of}} agents are now available. [...] Most liver transplant recipients receive corticosteroids plus a calcineurin inhibitor such as tacrolimus or ciclosporin, (also spelled cyclosporine and cyclosporin) plus a purine antagonist such as mycophenolate <b>mofetil.</b> Clinical outcome is better with tacrolimus than with ciclosporin {{during the first year of}} liver transplantation. If the patient has a co-morbidity such as active hepatitis B, high doses of hepatitis B immunoglubins are administrated in liver transplant patients.|$|E
2500|$|The ideal {{treatment}} for IgAN would remove IgA from the glomerulus and prevent further IgA deposition. [...] This goal still remains a remote prospect. There {{are a few}} additional caveats {{that have to be}} considered while treating IgA nephropathy. IgA nephropathy has a very variable course, ranging from a benign recurrent hematuria up to a rapid progression to chronic kidney failure. Hence the decision on which patients to treat should be based on the prognostic factors and the risk of progression. Also, IgA nephropathy recurs in transplants despite the use of ciclosporin, azathioprine or mycophenolate <b>mofetil</b> and steroids in these patients. There are persisting uncertainties, due to the limited number of patients included in the few controlled randomized studies performed to date, which hardly produce statistically significant evidence regarding the heterogeneity of IgA nephropathy patients, the diversity of study treatment protocols, and the length of follow-up.|$|E

50|$|Mycophenolic acid, less {{accurately}} called mycophenolate, is an {{immunosuppressant drug}} {{used to prevent}} rejection in organ transplantation. It inhibits an enzyme needed {{for the growth of}} T cells and B cells. It was initially marketed as the prodrug mycophenolate <b>mofetil</b> (MMF) to improve oral bioavailability. More recently, the salt mycophenolate sodium has also been introduced. Mycophenolate <b>mofetil</b> is marketed under the trade name CellCept and mycophenolate sodium as Myfortic.|$|E

5000|$|Acidity: Due to {{its effect}} of {{reducing}} stomach acidity, use of pantoprazole can affect absorption {{of drugs that}} are pH-sensitive such as ampicillin esters, ketoconazole, atazanavir, iron salts, amphetamine and mycophenolate <b>mofetil.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{patients}} {{not responding}} to this approach there is weak evidence supporting the use of intravenous immunoglobulin, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, mycophenolate <b>mofetil</b> and other agents; and trials of rituximab have indicated a potential therapeutic effect.|$|E
