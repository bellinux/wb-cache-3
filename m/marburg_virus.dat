50|$|The {{adenosine}} analog NITD008 {{has been}} reported to directly inhibit the recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the dengue virus by terminating its RNA chain synthesis. This suppresses peak viremia and rise in cytokines and prevented lethality in infected animals, raising the possibility of a new treatment for this flavivirus. The 7-deaza-adenosine analog has been shown to inhibit the replication of the hepatitis C virus.

25|$|Viral {{hemorrhagic fever}}s such as Ebola virus disease, Lassa fever virus, Rift Valley fever, <b>Marburg</b> <b>virus</b> and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever are highly {{contagious}} and deadly diseases, with the theoretical {{potential to become}} pandemics. Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected vector, and the vector only has a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly quarantine vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.|$|E

25|$|Bats {{were known}} to roost in the cotton factory in which the first cases of the 1976 and 1979 {{outbreaks}} were observed, and they have also been implicated in <b>Marburg</b> <b>virus</b> infections in 1975 and 1980. Of 24plant and 19vertebrate species experimentally inoculated with EBOV, only bats became infected. The bats displayed no clinical signs of disease, which is considered evidence that these bats are a reservoir species of EBOV. In a 2002–2003 survey of 1,030animals including 679bats from Gabon and the Republic of the Congo, 13fruit bats were found to contain EBOV RNA. Antibodies against Zaire and Reston viruses {{have been found in}} fruit bats in Bangladesh, suggesting that these bats are also potential hosts of the virus and that the filoviruses are present in Asia.|$|E

Additionally, poorly characterized pathogens which appear closely related to dangerous pathogens are often handled at this level until sufficient data are obtained either to confirm continued work at this level, or {{to work with them}} at a lower level.

40|$|AbstractEbola <b>viruses</b> and <b>Marburg</b> <b>viruses,</b> {{members of}} the {{filovirus}} family, cause severe hemorrhagic fever. The ability of these viruses to potently counteract host innate immune responses {{is thought to be}} an important component of viral pathogenesis. Several mechanisms of filoviral innate immune evasion have been defined and are reviewed here. These mechanisms include suppression of type I interferon (IFN) production; inhibition of IFN-signaling and mechanisms that either prevent cell stress responses or allow the virus to replicate {{in the face of such}} responses. A greater understanding of these innate immune evasion mechanisms may suggest novel therapeutic approaches for these deadly pathogens...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{pathological}} conditions and diseases {{can lead to}} internal bleeding. These include blood vessel rupture {{as a result of}} high blood pressure, aneurysms, esophageal varices or peptic ulcers.Another common cause of internal bleeding is carcinoma (cancer), either of the gastro-intestinal tract, of the lung, or more rarely of other organs such as the prostate, pancreas or kidney.Other diseases linked to internal bleeding include scurvy, hepatoma, liver cancer, Autoimmune Thrombocytopenia, ectopic pregnancy, malignant hypothermia, ovarian cysts, Vitamin K Deficiency, and hemophilia and malaria. Some viruses may cause a type of internal bleeding called viral hemorrhagic fever, such as the Ebola, Dengue or <b>Marburg</b> <b>viruses,</b> but these are rare.|$|R
40|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{outbreak of}} Ebola in West Africa resulted in over 28, 000 cases and 11, 000 deaths, underlining {{the need for}} {{a better understanding of the}} biology of this highly pathogenic virus to develop specific counter strategies. Two filoviruses, the Ebola and <b>Marburg</b> <b>viruses,</b> result in a severe and often fatal infection in humans. However, bats are natural hosts and survive filovirus infections without obvious symptoms. The molecular basis of this striking difference in the response to filovirus infections is not well understood. We report a systematic overview of differentially expressed genes, activity motifs and pathways in human and bat cells infected with the Ebola and <b>Marburg</b> <b>viruses,</b> and we demonstrate that the replication of filoviruses is more rapid in human cells than in bat cells. We also found that the most strongly regulated genes upon filovirus infection are chemokine ligands and transcription factors. We observed a strong induction of the JAK/STAT pathway, of several genes encoding inhibitors of MAP kinases (DUSP genes) and of PPP 1 R 15 A, which is involved in ER stress-induced cell death. We used comparative transcriptomics to provide a data resource that can be used to identify cellular responses that might allow bats to survive filovirus infections. Additional co-authors: Andreas J.

2500|$|The virus {{responsible}} for the initial outbreak, first thought to be <b>Marburg</b> <b>virus,</b> was later identified as {{a new type of}} virus related to marburgviruses. Virus strain samples isolated from both outbreaks were named as the [...] "Ebola virus" [...] after the Ebola River, located near the originally identified viral outbreak site in Zaire. Reports conflict about who initially coined the name: either Karl Johnson of the American CDC team or Belgian researchers. Subsequently, a number of other cases were reported, almost all centered on the Yambuku mission hospital or having close contact with another case. 318 cases and 280 deaths (an 88 percent fatality rate) occurred in Zaire. Although it was assumed that the two outbreaks were connected, scientists later realized that they were caused by two distinct ebolaviruses, SUDV and EBOV. The Zaire outbreak was contained {{with the help of the}} World Health Organization and transport from the Congolese air force, by quarantining villagers, sterilizing medical equipment, and providing protective clothing.|$|E
