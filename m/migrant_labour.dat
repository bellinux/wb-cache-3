5|$|In 1801, the {{population}} of Wales was 587 thousand, {{and most of these}} would have been living in rural areas and employed in agriculture. By 1911, {{the population}} had swelled to 2.4 million, more than half of whom lived in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, where they were employed in mining, steel and other industries. There was a shift away from the land with many dwellers in the rural west emigrating in the 1830s and 1840s and migrating to the cities {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century. By 1911, agriculture was a minor industry in Glamorgan, and <b>migrant</b> <b>labour</b> from England was needed to help get in the harvest. Rural craftsmen were also lost and their supply was replenished from depressed areas of southwestern England and by mass immigration from Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Clarke was {{a critic}} of <b>migrant</b> <b>labour</b> schemes, which were {{designed}} to attract foreign labour to Rhodesia, and in 1900 he defended the rights of indigenous labour against infringement by foreign Africans from Mozambique, Nyasaland, Zambia and South Africa. As early as 1900, the BSAC came to the Colonial Office with a proposal regarding Chinese labour. In London, the Land and Mine Owners Association was formed in 1902 to lobby the Colonial Office and continued to press throughout 1903. The Colonial Office postponed its decision saying that the question concerned not only Rhodesia but all of southern Africa. Milner was lobbied by the BSAC and he promised his support. Clarke, however, dismissed the demands, arguing that 'the introduction {{of large numbers of}} Asiatics... will subject the aboriginal natives to unfair competition'. He forecast that the labour shortage was temporary and that the new bureau would satisfy demand. Clarke also argued that most Rhodesians were opposed to the introduction of Chinese labour. The Duke of Marlborough, then Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, recorded that he found Clarke's argument more convincing than Milner's, and the Colonial Office refused the proposal.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of mining increased {{the migration of}} native African people in search of employment to the province from elsewhere in Africa. The mining industry improved {{the standard of living}} of those living along Northern Rhodesia's railroads, and increased the influx of white people, the Europeans from South Africa who wanted to maintain their superiority over the native African population. Native Africans were poorly treated by the whites and discouraged from working in the mines; this evolved into a racial struggle. The high rate of immigration to the region increased the number of unplanned settlements. The BSAC introduced a hut tax in 1901 in North-Eastern Rhodesia and between 1904 and 1913 in North-Western Rhodesia for all migrants. The tax was high (in some cases, six months' wages), and intended to create a system of debt bondage and generate income for investment in other mines. Unrest caused by tax increases was suppressed {{with the help of the}} British South Africa Police. The imposition of tax was a strategy adopted to create bond labour and sustain demand during the 1920s when the demand for miners was higher. The company was able to maintain low wages on account of predominance of <b>migrant</b> <b>labour</b> from rural regions. The African miners had three major issues: low wages compared to European miners, a prohibition against working in mines reserved for Europeans despite high skills, and workplace harassment and brutality.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this study}} is to profile the {{international}} <b>migrant</b> <b>labours</b> who are legally working in the tourism and hospitality industry in Malaysia. Langkawi has been chosen to present the scope of the study due to the fact that it is a world tourist destination. The profile presents a various pattern of international <b>migrant</b> <b>labours</b> socio-demographic characteristics and factors motivating them to work in the industry. It is noted that majority of the international <b>migrant</b> <b>labours</b> who are working in the tourism and hospitality industry in Langkawi consists of male within the range of 18 – 30 years old and single. Interestingly, majority of them are Indonesian, having a certificate and mostly educated from secondary school. Majority of them also contributes as semi-skilled labours. Regardless of various sectors in the tourism and hospitality industry, the international <b>migrant</b> <b>labours</b> enjoy working in the accommodation sector. Most of them have been working for 1 – 5 years and receiving an income of RM 1, 000 – RM 4, 999 per month. The profile also highlights that majority of the international <b>migrant</b> <b>labours</b> want to gain new experience and most of them are also following their friends. Langkawi is chosen as a destination due to the fact that it is a beautiful island, easy to get around and also a peaceful place to work. Further, it is emphasized in the profile that the international <b>migrant</b> <b>labours</b> have chosen to work in the accommodation sector based on high wages factor...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{registered}} <b>migrant</b> <b>labours</b> (more than 2. 3 million in year 2013) send to Malaysia are being employed in various work sectors including construction, manufacturing, plantation, agriculture and services. While the source countries are from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, India, China, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Vietnam. The fundamental concern is on <b>migrant</b> <b>labours</b> status because they remain {{the employees of}} those outsourcing companies and not the factories where they work. This is because work contract are made between the out sourcing companies and the factories owners (the employers) and not between the employees and the employers. This leaves great consequences on the employees. Legally, in labour relations, the lack on privity of contract between the employee and employer {{raise the question of}} legal responsibility and liability between the contracting parties. This paper will deal further on the receiving government policy, law and practice as well as the responsibility and liability of the outsourcing companies towards the <b>migrant</b> <b>labours</b> and the employers...|$|R

40|$|International {{migration}} {{is an old}} phenomenon caused by many factors divided into push and pull factors. However, there is no enough coverage on {{the perceptions of the}} <b>labour</b> <b>migrants.</b> Although there is a vast body of writing on migration, this study delves into the experiential perceptions of academic <b>labour</b> <b>migrants</b> at Rhodes University. These academic <b>labour</b> <b>migrants</b> include professors, lecturers, researchers and postdoctoral research fellows. The study took a qualitative approach to document the experiential perceptions of academic <b>labour</b> <b>migrants</b> at Rhodes University. In-depth interviews were conducted with twelve respondents, to analyse how academic <b>labour</b> <b>migrants</b> perceive South Africa’s changing visa policies in the context of regional integration and development, migration networks and choice, host-migrant relations. The study is underpinned by Probsting’s (2015) concept of "spatial fix" in the context of capitalism and migration, to locate the positionality of academic <b>labour</b> <b>migrants</b> within a capitalist society. The study established that the increase in skilled labour {{migration is}} relatively linked to the expansion of capitalism. Based on the perceptions of the respondents, the study concluded that migration is inherently vital in providing cheap labour for capitalists. It established that changing visa policies is not without problems. Historical dispositions of the apartheid system, conflicting domestic versus international imperatives, neo-liberal policies and the widely condemned results of capitalism as an imperialist system and other factors influence migration management in South Africa...|$|R
25|$|In the 1950s, post-war {{demand for}} housing led the State Government to create a public housing programme, {{providing}} cheap accommodation to cope with returning servicemen, and the boom in <b>migrant</b> <b>labour.</b> Suburbs such as Bellerive, Lindisfarne, Montagu Bay, Mornington, Rosny and Warrane all expanded dramatically throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and housing from the period still often bears the distinctive design patterns of former government housing. For {{many parts of the}} city electricity supply only arrived in the 1950s, and sealed roads, mains water, and sewage only began to be provided in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|In 1845, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4–2hectares (1–5acres) in size, while 40% were of 2–6hectares (5–15acres). Holdings were {{so small}} that no crop other than {{potatoes}} would suffice to feed a family. Shortly before the famine the British government reported that poverty was so widespread that one-third of all Irish small holdings could not support their families after paying their rent, except by earnings of seasonal <b>migrant</b> <b>labour</b> in England and Scotland. Following the famine, reforms were implemented making it illegal to further divide land holdings.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{immigrant}} workers mainly from {{new member states}} of the European Union in Central and Eastern Europe comprise a large component of the seasonal agricultural workforce, particularly {{in the south of}} the county where more labour-intensive crops such as small vegetables and cut flowers are typically grown. This seasonal influx of <b>migrant</b> <b>labour</b> occasionally causes tension between the migrant workforce and local people, in a county which is relatively unaccustomed to large-scale immigration. However, {{as a result of the}} current economic climate some food production facilities have closed down, this has caused some reduction in the levels of migrant workers. The large number of people from Portugal is still obvious in the town of Boston, and in Grantham the number of Polish workers is apparent.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Migrant</b> <b>labour</b> {{remained}} a fundamental {{aspect of the}} South African mining industry, which employed half a million mostly black miners. Labour unrest in the industry resulted in a massacre in mid-August 2012, when anti-riot police shot dead 34 striking miners and wounded many more in {{what is known as}} the Marikana massacre. The incident was widely criticised by the public, civil society organisations and religious leaders. The <b>migrant</b> <b>labour</b> system was identified as a primary cause of the unrest.

40|$|The {{historical}} {{forces of}} globalization are mainly {{derived from the}} logic of capitalism. The social relations of globalization {{are based on the}} requirements of capital accumulation. There has been further global wealth concentration, rather than global wealth redistribution. In this framework, there are two axes of analysis involved in women's labour and globalization: one is women as victims of economic process; the other is the potential for women as subjects of the process. When women are perceived as an agency in the globalization process, they become a social force capable of acting in their own interest. Democratization requires significant changes in the composition of power, allowing the inclusion of a broad spectrum of social forces into the state. This includes incorporation of unorganised labour, such as women's labour, children's <b>labour</b> and <b>migrant's</b> <b>labour...</b>|$|R
