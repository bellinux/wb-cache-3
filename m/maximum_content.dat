It is unavailable in many places, although its use is common in the western United States and Canada.

The FEEDAP Panel developed, based on an approximation using zinc requirements and background data, potential new <b>maximum</b> <b>contents,</b> which could replace the current ones. The newly proposed total <b>maximum</b> <b>contents</b> are: 150 mg Zn/kg complete feed for piglets, sows, rabbits, salmonids, cats and dogs; 120 mg Zn/kg complete feed for turkeys for fattening; 100 mg Zn/kg complete feed for all other species and categories.

The composition of pollen loads showed the <b>maximum</b> <b>contents</b> of dry matter, ash, glucose, fructose, magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), and manganese (Mn) for the date palm; the <b>maximum</b> <b>contents</b> of protein, calcium (Ca), and zinc (Zn) for alfalfa; the <b>maximum</b> <b>contents</b> of fiber, and copper (Cu) for the sunflower; the <b>maximum</b> <b>contents</b> of the lipids and iron (Fe) for summer squash; and the <b>maximum</b> <b>contents</b> of sodium (Na), and potassium (K) for rape.

The high levels of protein, ash, glucose, and fructose, and low lipid content found in bee-pollen from the date palm and from alfalfa, mean that pollen from the date palm and from alfalfa make an excellent food supplement.

Mastacembelus pancalus, Xenntodon cancila, Chanda baculis and Glossogobius giuris were used for preparation of dust which can be preserved for a time period. The fishes were sun dried or oven dried, which are also method of preservation. Quality of the oven-dried fish was better than that of the sun-dried fish, but sun-drying process is easy and can be used in large scale. The fish powder remained in good condition for 7 - 9 months at normal room temperature, but at- 18 °C the powder was in good condition throughout the year. Highest quantity of powder from 1 kg of fish was obtained in case of the mixed species as 24. 61 % and the lowest in O. bacaila which was 20. 52 %. Biochemical analysis showed that the <b>maximum</b> calcium <b>content</b> was found as 1. 34 % in M. vittatus and minimum was 0. 80 % in mixed SIS fishes. <b>Maximum</b> phosphorus <b>content</b> was 2. 90 % in C. ranga and minimum was 1. 72 % in C. soborna. <b>Maximum</b> iron <b>content</b> was found as 45. 20 mg/ 100 g in mixed SIS fishes and minimum was found as 16. 85 mg/ 100 g in O. bacaila.
