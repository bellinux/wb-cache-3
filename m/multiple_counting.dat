Examination of serial slices was carried out to correctly identify mechanoreceptors, as they have relatively large size.|$|E
40|$|The EU Directive on the {{promotion}} of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market (Directive 2001 / 77 /EC) asks Member States, among others, to is-sue guarantees of origin for renewable electricity on request. Member States are obliged to ap-point one or more independent bodies to certify that green electricity comes from renewable en-ergy sources. These bodies will supervise {{the issue of the}} guarantees of origin (GO). The Direc-tive stipulates that these bodies should be in place no later than 27 October 2003. The RE-GO project has been conducted in the framework of the EU Altener programme and aims to: 1. review the implementation and use of GO in the EU, 2. analyse the GO as a tool for renewable energy policy formulation, 3. analyse the GO as a tracking method and the problem of <b>multiple</b> <b>counting.</b> The present report covers the second objective. The analysis presented in the report involves an identification of the potential interactions between GO and various renewable energy support policies which are currently implemented in the Member States, and an evaluation of the poten-tial role GO can play in facilitating these policies. The analysis covers the interactions between GO and indicative targets, Tradable Renewable Electricity Certificate (TREC) systems, feed-in-tariffs, fiscal incentives, electricity labels, electricity disclosure, the Renewable Energy Certifi-cate System (RECS) and the EU Emission Trading Scheme. The GO implementation design varies considerably among the Member States. Some countries have implemented a GO system that does not go beyond the minimum requirements of the Di-rective, whilst other countries have included additional information to enable GO to facilitate national renewable energy policy mechanisms. The report concludes that GO systems based on the minimum requirements of the EU Directive 2001 / 77 /EC on {{the promotion}} of electricity produced from renewable energy sources, cannot be linked to national renewable energy support mechanisms, and, therefore, can easily lead to inef-ficiencies, in transparencies and also to <b>multiple</b> <b>counting</b> of the environmental benefits. It is recommended, therefore, to implement a GO system that goes beyond the minimum require-ments {{so that it can be}} fully integrated into the national support mechanisms. In this way GO can become a key component of the national renewable energy policy. In the longer term, a fully harmonised GO system across the European Union would be advisable to avoid duplica-tion of verification and monitoring efforts, and to effectively prevent <b>multiple</b> <b>counting</b> of environmental benefits...|$|E

A video based surveillance system for monitoring crowd behaviour is developed. The system detects dangerous situations by analysing the dynamics of the crowd density. Therefore we developed a grid-based people counting algorithm which provides density per cell for the global view on the monitored area. Since multiple cameras may observe same parts of the monitored area, the challenge is not only to count people seen by single cameras, but also to merge the views. Therefore we first detect people seen by each camera separately and then sum the results to a global representation.

In order to address this limitation, a continuous-time unit-specific event-based and slot-based hybrid model framework with hierarchical structure is proposed in this work. A unit-specific event-based model without utility constraints is formulated in upper layer, and a slot-based model is introduced in lower layer. In the hierarchical structure, the two layers jointly address the short-term production scheduling problem of batch plants under utility consideration. The key features of this work include the following: (a) eliminating overstrict constraints on utility resources, (b) solving <b>multiple</b> <b>counting</b> problems, and (c) considering duration time of event points in calculating utility utilization level.

In general, most methods technically fulfilled those criteria, with exception of the “Worst case ” or marginal approach which resulted in <b>multiple</b> <b>counting</b> of global emissions. The selection amongst the acceptable methods still remains rather subjective. The conclusions of agricultural LCA studies, related for example to the GHG emissions from livestock feed, are strong-ly dependent on the selected method, and for this reason a universally accepted single method is needed.

A new method {{based on the}} geometrical projection performed by a ray-congruence has been developed as a preconditioning of the ray tracing procedure. It builds a visibility tree, i. e., a database, storing information on all possible ray paths inside a scenario. The method gives a solution to a class of open problems of ray tracing techniques: ray missing, double (<b>multiple)</b> <b>counting,</b> termination criterion, calculation upgrade. Other features of the method are the multipath map and the multipath classification that allow the user to know the relevance of multipath at any point of the scenario in advance, before ray-tracing calculation. The method can be systematically applied to scenarios pertaining to different applications provided that the objects belong to the class of polyhedrons.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{algorithm}} for counting N indistinguishable objects, called targets, by {{a collection of}} sensors. We adopt a minimalist scenario where sensors are unaware of the (non-empty) intersections of sensing regions, and so simple addition of all sensor counts inflates estimates {{of the total number}} of targets. The <b>multiple</b> <b>counting</b> in intersections must be accounted for, but with nothing more than the sensor counts, this is clearly impossible. However, noise is typically present in the target counting of many, if not most, applications. We make the key observation that if there is a (target-dependent) noise source affecting all sensors simultaneously, then it couples those with non-empty intersections. Exploitation of this coupling allows us to extract multiple-counting statistics from stochastic correlation patterns, and hence to compute accurate estimates of N via the classical inclusion-exclusion formula. Cumulants are the correlation measures of choice. Our analysis brings out and resolves certain technicalities that arise in our statistical counting algorithm. Examples are worked out to show the potential of the new algorithm. The paper concludes with a discussion of alternative models and open problems...|$|E

40|$|Are we {{recognizable}} by {{our image}} preferences? This paper answers affirmatively the question, presenting a soft biomet-ric approach where the preferred images {{of an individual}} are used as his personal signature in identification tasks. The approach builds a multi-resolution latent space, formed by <b>multiple</b> <b>Counting</b> Grids, where similar images are mapped nearby. On this space, a set of preferred images of a user produces an ensemble of intensity maps, highlighting in an intuitive way his personal aesthetic preferences. These maps are then used for learning a battery of discriminative classi-fiers (one for each resolution), which characterizes the user and serves to perform identification. Results are promis-ing: on a dataset of 200 users, and 40 K images, using 20 preferred images as biometric template gives 66 % of proba-bility of guessing the correct user. This makes the “personal aesthetics ” a very hot topic for soft biometrics, while its us-age in standard biometric applications seems to be far from being effective, as we show in a simple user study...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{data mining}} {{requires}} {{the analysis of}} the interactions in space. These interactions can be materialized using distance tables, reducing spatial data mining to multi-table analysis. However, conventional data mining algorithms consider only one input table where each row is an observation to analyze. Simple relational joins between these tables does not resolve the problem and mislead the results because of the <b>multiple</b> <b>counting</b> of observations. We propose three alternatives of multi-table data mining in the context of spatial data mining. The first makes a hard modification in the conventional algorithm in order to consider those tables. The second is an optimization of the first approach. It pre-computes all join operations and adapts the conventional algorithm. The third re-organizes data into a unique table by completing -not joining- the target table using the existing data in the other tables, then applies any standard data mining algorithm without modification.

A new Stata command allows taking advantage of Internet search engines, like Google or Yahoo to find proper substitutes for an unclear word or multiple words. The distinctive feature of the search engines is that they rely not only on the spelling similarity, but are also context driven: other words may affect the suggestion, such as including "city" into the query. This will hint to the search engine to give more priority to the names of cities.

40|$|The Galilean {{invariance}} of the Navier-Stokes {{equation is}} shown to be akin to a global gauge symmetry familiar from quantum field theory. This symmetry leads to a <b>multiple</b> <b>counting</b> of infinitely many inertial reference frames in the path integral approach to randomly stirred fluids. This problem is solved by fixing the gauge, i. e., singling out one reference frame. The gauge fixed theory has an underlying Becchi-Rouet-Stora (BRS) symmetry {{which leads to the}} Ward identity relating the exact inverse response and vertex functions. This identification of Galilean invariance as a gauge symmetry is explored in detail, for different gauge choices and by performing a rigorous examination of a discretized version of the theory. The Navier-Stokes equation is also invariant under arbitrary rectilinear frame accelerations, known as extended Galilean invariance (EGI). We gauge fix this extended symmetry and derive the generalized Ward identity that follows from the BRS invariance of the gauge-fixed theory. This new Ward identity reduces to the standard one in the limit of zero acceleration. This gauge-fixing approach unambiguously shows that Galilean invariance and EGI constrain only the zero mode of the vertex but none of the higher wavenumber modes.

40|$|International audienceFor several animal taxa, {{non-lethal}} {{techniques that}} do not rely on collecting individuals are routinely used to assess biodiversity (e. g. point counts in birds). Identification often relies {{on the ability of}} the observer, are subjected to errors, but populations are not impacted. Thus, <b>multiple</b> <b>counting</b> sessions (MCS) that allow using robust analyses (e. g. unbiased Chao richness estimate) are available. However, for most species (e. g. arthropods), trap systems must be set up. Killed individuals are collected and later accurately identified in the laboratory, but unbiased MCS become unavailable. Environmental DNA bar-coding provides an alternative, yet it requires important technical support and is not designed for MCS. Lethal rapid biodiversity assessments (RBA), derived from classical trap surveys and based on less accurate identifications (morphospecies are used), have been successfully developed to relax technical constraints. In this study, we combined non-lethal and RBA approaches to address logistical, analytical and ethical issues. We tested five versions of a protocol to visually survey the macro-fauna of hedgerows. A large number of individuals were directly identified in the field, mostly arthropods but also vertebrates. Identification error varied with taxonomic level and lineage, but remained low at the morphospecies level. Importantly, estimates tended to reach asymptotes, suggesting that local richness was appropriately appraised. Like any technique, non-lethal RBA (NL-RBA) present both advantages and weaknesses, and may improve the toolbox to survey biodiversity...|$|E
30|$|More precisely, when {{a journey}} route (in {{this case a}} {{foremost}} journey route) from s to x (s x) is a prefix of a journey route x y {{at a later time}} snapshot, we perform a procedure called SpecialCount (Algorithm  3). The special count procedure involves aggregating the values of Count_s[v,x] with Count_x[v',y], for all nodes (resp. v, v') occurring in the journey routes between s and x and between x and y (see Algorithm  3). Algorithm  3 simply calculates the product of the number of foremost journeys between two routes s x, and x y, if they do not share any vertex (lines 4 – 9). If instead they share some vertex v, the calculation is slightly more complicated: let a be the number of foremost journeys from s to y where v is visited at least once on the route between x and y; let b be the number of foremost journeys from s to y where v is visited at least once on the route between s and x; and let c be the sum of a and b. c represents the number of all foremost journeys from s to y that pass through v. However, c counts the journey route passing through v multiple times if v happened to exist in both Count_s[v,x] and Count_x[v,y], and we need to remove such <b>multiple</b> <b>counting</b> of journeys, which is done along with the update to Count_s[v,y] in line 13.|$|E
