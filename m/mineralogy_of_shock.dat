The high-pressure minerals in these rocks result either from solid-state reactions or from the crystallization of melts at high pressures. Comparisons <b>of</b> naturally <b>shocked</b> samples with samples processed in dynamic experiments must be made with extreme caution. The durations <b>of</b> the equilibrium <b>shock</b> pressure experienced by meteorites can vary over at least three orders of magnitude (10 − 2 s to 10 s), and they lie within the lower range of the duration of static experiments conducted in diamond anvil cells or multianvil apparatus. We emphasize that dynamic experiments up to 130 GPa have never produced any reconstructive solid-state phase transition or liquidus high-pressure minerals that offer a reliable calibration of the continuum <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> pressures and temperatures. The solid-state transformations observed in shocked meteorites are in many cases incomplete and provide only insights into the initial stages of high-pressure phase transitions, crystallization, and chemical interdiffusion. In contrast, the natural high-pressure species crystallized from silicate liquids at high pressures and temperatures provide more precise information on the pressures and temperatures reached during a shock event on the parental asteroid. The kinetics of phase transitions and diffusion of trace elements permit meaningful estimates of the pressure, temperature, and shock durations. We also present information on new dense minerals (C and TiO 2) in terrestrial shocked rocks in impact craters and discuss their relevance to a reliable estimate of pressure and temperature conditions...|$|R
40|$|The problem under {{investigation}} is basically two fold, (1) {{the determination of}} the partial grain-size distribution and (2) the <b>mineralogy</b> <b>of</b> the clay/fine silt size fractions of the equatorial Atlantic bottom sediments. From these data, it was hoped to find the controlling factors for the size distribution and <b>mineralogy</b> <b>of</b> the bottom sediments. That is, whether the <b>mineralogy</b> <b>of</b> these sediments reflects the grain-size distribution, clay mineral flocculation, diagenesis, or influences of local source areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{two models}} of {{carbonaceous}} chondrite precursor material presently formulated {{to study the}} process of aqueous alteration in hydrous asteroids are based, in the first case, on the anhydrous <b>mineralogy</b> <b>of</b> CM chondrites, while the second is based on that of the CV chondrites. It is noted that the alteration <b>mineralogy</b> <b>of</b> the CM chondrites and their parent asteroids may be produced by starting with the anhydrous <b>mineralogy</b> <b>of</b> the same CM chondrites, at temperatures in the 1 - 25 C range, {{with a wide variety}} of rock/fluid ratios. The <b>mineralogy</b> <b>of</b> the important CI chondrites is reproducible through the alteration of either CM or CV anhydrous material, at temperatures in the 50 - 150 C...|$|R

40|$|Dust {{coatings}} on rocks {{obscured the}} underlying rock surfaces at the Mars Pathfinder landing site {{and made it}} difficult to obtain pristine visible/near-infrared reflectance spectra and chemical measurements. Such dust coatings also affect the ability of thermal infrared (TIR) spectra (such as that provided by TES and future lander (mini-TES) and orbiter multispectral imaging systems (THEMIS) to reveal accurately the <b>mineralogy</b> <b>of</b> rocks and soils. Similarly, high shock pressures from impact events cause crystalline disorder in important minerals such as pyroxene and feldspar that also affects their TIR spectra and complicates spectral interpretation <b>of</b> <b>shocked</b> impact materials.

To assess {{the success of the}} RQXRD method, the bulk <b>mineralogy</b> <b>of</b> the dacite was determined through a combination of optical study of phenocrysts (plagioclase, augite, orthopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxide) and detailed study of the groundmass using a scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX) analysis system. The groundmass consisted of distinct crystals of feldspar, pyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxide, and patches of very fine-grained mixtures (referred to as funkalite) of feldspar, SiO 2 phase, and Fe-Ti oxide. Groundmass volume percentages were determined by point counting high magnification SEM photomicrographs. These data were combined with phenocryst percentages and converted to weight percentages. The optical/SEM and RQXRD results compared rather well, suggesting RQXRD can provide a relatively rapid method for quantifying the <b>mineralogy</b> <b>of</b> volcanic rocks...|$|R
