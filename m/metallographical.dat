40|$|Generally, the <b>metallographical</b> replica {{method is}} applied on the {{external}} {{surface of the}} energetic pipes {{in order to assess}} the structural degradation. This nondestructive method allows to obtain information regarding the grow and sheroidization of carbides, as well as the propagation of cavities leading to cracks. Considering the analysed pipe a thick-walled cylinder, from the theory of maximum tangential unit stress, the permanent deformations appear, firstly, in the neighborhood of the cylinder internal surface. Thereby, the aim of the paper is to evaluate and compare the structural degradation of the external and, respectively internal surface of a pipe made out from 12 CrMoV 3 steel, with the dimensions of  273 x 38 mm, using the <b>metallographical</b> replica method. The pipe worked at the temperature of 5400 C and the pressure of 140 bar, for 44, 827 hours. The obtained results showed that the structural degradation level of the internal surface is higher with about 11 – 18 % than the structural degradation level of the pipe external surface. Thus, by applying the <b>metallographical</b> replica method, a certain level of structural degradation of the material external surface is established; the degradation level at the internal surface of the pipe is equal or higher than the one determined on the external surface...|$|E

40|$|Several {{pre-oxidation}} {{procedures have}} been tested {{with respect to their}} effect as a hydrogen permeation barrier at the hightemperature alloys Hastelloy X and Inconel 617. By outside coating (Vacuum-Plasma-Spraying, Physical-Vapor-Depositiori) of Hastelloy X samples with alumina the determined impeding effects were very low. A surface aluminium enrichment by different procedures (Diffusionwelding, Physical-Vapor-Deposition, Mechanical-Aluminiumcoating, Aluminiumpainting, Aluminium-Hot-Dipping) were accomplished before selective oxidation. The method of Aluminium-Hot-Dipping generated oxide layers with a four- to fivefold higher impeding effect compared to specimens fabricated by a standard procedure. With the aid of a <b>metallographical</b> follow-up examination it was shown that the higer impeding effects are due to an improved adhesion between the oxide layer and the high temperature material, whereby in the cooling period after manufacturing a smaller amount of oxide cracking is obtainable.
