25|$|The January 2008 Western North American storm complex was a {{powerful}} Pacific extratropical cyclone that affected a large area North America, primarily stretching from western British Columbia to near the Tijuana, Mexico area, starting on January 3, 2008. The system was responsible for flooding rains across many areas in California along with very strong winds locally exceeding hurricane force strength as well as heavy <b>mountain</b> <b>snows</b> across the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain chains {{as well as those}} in Idaho, Utah and Colorado. The storms were {{responsible for the death of}} at least 12 people across three states, and extensive damage to utility services as well, as damage to some other structures. The storm was also responsible for most of the January 2008 tornado outbreak from January 7–8.|$|E
500|$|An unusually warm winter, {{with warm}} days and cold nights, {{was also a}} factor. Water in the mountain's {{fissures}} froze and thawed repeatedly, further weakening the mountain's supports. Heavy snowfall in the region in March {{was followed by a}} warm April, causing the <b>mountain</b> <b>snows</b> to melt into the fissures. [...] GSC geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide. [...] The crew of the freight train that arrived at Frank shortly before the disaster said it was the coldest night of the winter, with overnight temperatures falling below [...] Geologists speculated that the cold snap and rapid freezing resulted in expansion of the fissures, causing the limestone to break off and tumble down the mountain.|$|E

60|$|Yancy's ranch-house {{stood on}} the bank of a fine stream which purled--in keen {{defiance}} of the hot sun--over a gravel bed, so near to the <b>mountain</b> <b>snows</b> that their coolness still lingered in the ripples. The house, a long, low, log hut, was fenced with antlers of the elk, adorned with morning-glory vines, and shaded by lofty cottonwood-trees, and its green grass-plat--after the sun-smit hills of the long morning's ride--was very grateful to the Eastern man's eyes.|$|E
60|$|They glided {{through the}} streets on to the broad, hard road, and crept upwards with {{scarcely}} a sound, through the blue-black twilight. Around {{and in front of}} them little lights shone out from the villas and small houses dotted away in the mountains. Almost imperceptibly they passed into a different atmosphere. The air became cold and exhilarating. The flavour of the <b>mountain</b> <b>snows</b> gave life to the breeze. Hunterleys buttoned up his coat but bared his head.|$|E
60|$|For {{a mile or}} more our road {{ran down}} a winding, rocky gorge, till {{suddenly}} it took a turn, and the country of Kaloon lay stretched before us. At our feet was a river, probably the same with which we had made acquaintance in the gulf, where, fed by the <b>mountain</b> <b>snows,</b> it had its source. Here it flowed rapidly, but on the vast, alluvial lands beneath became a broad and gentle stream that wound {{its way through the}} limitless plains till it was lost in the blue of the distance.|$|E

60|$|Arriving {{there without}} any great difficulty, Otter stood astonished, {{although}} he was not much given {{to the study of}} scenery. Below him lay the City of the Mist, with its shining belt of rivers that, fed from the inexhaustible <b>mountain</b> <b>snows,</b> meandered across the vast plains--now no longer hidden in mist--which they had trodden on their journey. Above his head the mighty peak towered thousands of feet into the air, till it ended in a summit shaped like a human finger pointing eternally to the heavens. Before him the scene was even stranger, made up as it was of snowy fields broken by ridges of black rock, and laid one beneath the other like white sails drying upon the slopes of a sandhill.|$|E
60|$|Once indeed such an {{accident}} did happen. I {{was seated in}} the garden with Ayesha and watching her. Her head rested on her hand, and she was looking with her wide eyes, across which the swift thoughts passed like clouds over a windy sky, or dreams through {{the mind of a}} sleeper--looking out vacantly towards the <b>mountain</b> <b>snows.</b> Seen thus her loveliness was inexpressible, amazing; merely to gaze upon it was an intoxication. Contemplating it, I understood indeed that, like to that of the fabled Helen, this gift of hers alone--and it was but one of many--must have caused infinite sorrows, had she ever been permitted to display it to the world. It would have driven humanity to madness: the men with longings and the women with jealousy and hate.|$|E
60|$|Very {{gradually}} the light increased, {{and it seemed}} to Otter that the mist was somewhat thinner than was usual at this hour, though as yet it hung densely between them and the <b>mountain</b> <b>snows.</b> Now he could trace the walls of the amphitheatre, now he could see the black shimmer of the water beneath, and distinguish the glitter of many hundreds of upturned eyeballs as they glared at him and beyond him. The silence grew more and more intense, for none spoke or moved: all were waiting to see the dawn break upon the slope of snow, and wondering--would it be red or white? Must the gods die or live? So intense and fearful was the hush, unbroken by a breath of air or the calling of a bird, that Otter could bear it no longer, but suddenly burst into song.|$|E
