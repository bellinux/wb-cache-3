50|$|The {{shape of}} Pereskiopsis {{is not that}} <b>of</b> a <b>typical</b> <b>cactus,</b> it has large green leaves and grows like a bush. Only the {{presence}} of areoles, usually with spines and glochids, and the flowers, {{allow it to be}} identified as a cactus. Flowers open during the day. Pereskiopsis is often used as a grafting stock for other cacti, as it promotes quick growth of the scion. Its small diameter makes it an excellent grafting stock for small seedlings, but many species will outgrow the stock and need to be re-grafted or rooted. Pereskiopsis are tropical cactus and can not withstand any frost. Maintain a temperature of approximately 12 °C during winter and be careful with water. The stem tends to rot very easily, especially with low temperatures when the plant is not actively growing.|$|R

Each method is described in detail with other parameters and approach. The focus is put on methods which are useful for the topographic mapping (f. e. orienteering maps) and for cartographic visualization. All this methods are tested for different data and type of relief (plain, mountainous, rock city, area with negative shapes). The aim of study is to find the optimal method for each type of relief which expresses <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> features.

40|$|Based on our highly {{efficient}} Navier-Stokes solver, LVOF (Li, et al., 2004, 2007), we present some results for water entry and exit in a 3 D numerical wave tank, by implementing our {{design of a}} mass-force coupling scheme for water impact (Li, et al., 2007 a). LVOF is constructed by a novel VOF finite volume cut-cells approach that incorporates surface tension, coupled with a dynamic subgrid-scale model. Our mass-force coupling model in theory represents the coupling of a moving body on the flow, which is realized through introducing the internal source function. Importantly, a solid body is treated as a fluid, especially the solid-liquid phase front is captured over a fixed Cartesian grid without smearing the information at the particle-fluid interface. Grid refinement studies are performed for test problems involving the wedge entry and exit. In addition, issue about the convergence performance is addressed under the prescribed entry velocity. Very encouragingly, the results agree with measurements available. It is demonstrated that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> features in complex flow patterns can be captured in waves caused by impact, by using LVOF...|$|R
