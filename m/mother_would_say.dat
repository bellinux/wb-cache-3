2500|$|The film {{tells the}} story of a street gang of {{children}} who terrorize their impoverished neighborhood, at one point brutalizing a blind man and at another assaulting a legless man who moves around on a dolly, which they toss down a hill. [...] Film historian Carl J. Mora has said of Los olvidados that the director: [...] "visualized poverty in a radically different way from the traditional forms of Mexican melodrama. [...] Buñuel's street children are not 'ennobled' by their desperate struggle for survival; they are in fact ruthless predators who are not better than their equally unromanticized victims". [...] The film was made quickly (18 days) and cheaply (450,000 pesos), with Buñuel's fee being the equivalent of $2,000. [...] During filming, a number of members of the crew resisted the production in a variety of ways: [...] one technician confronted Buñuel and asked why he didn't make a [...] "real" [...] Mexican movie [...] "rather than a miserable picture like this one", the film's hairdresser quit on the spot over a scene in which the protagonist's mother refuses to give him food ("In Mexico, no <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that to her son."), another staff member urged Buñuel to abandon shooting on a [...] "garbage heap", noting that there were many [...] "lovely residential neighborhoods like Las Lomas" [...] that were available, while Pedro de Urdimalas, one of the scriptwriters, refused to allow his name in the credits.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Tohru's {{feelings}} for Kyo develop and she eventually admits {{he is the}} Sohma she wants the most to free, because she loves him. This, however, only distresses her further, as she feels she is being unfaithful to her mother's memory. However, when Tohru finally confesses to Kyo, he tells her he knew her mother {{when he was a}} child, and that he could have saved Kyoko from the car that killed her except it would have revealed his curse and Kyoko's final word [...] "I won't forgive you!" [...] (Later it is understood that she meant to say [...] "I won't forgive you if you don't take care of Tohru!") But Tohru doesn't believe her <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that but if she did she would have to go against it because she loves him. Unable in his guilt to accept Tohru's feelings, he says her love is an illusion and runs away. As she follows him, she meets Akito, who believes that Tohru's kindness to and acceptance of the cursed zodiac members has made them unfaithful to her, weakening their [...] "bond" [...] to the point that Momiji and Hiro have been freed from the curse. As she angrily confronts her, however, Tohru realizes that she is trapped by the past as much as she herself has been, by clinging to her mother's memory, and she extends her hand in friendship to Akito and introduces herself as a new start. However, before Akito can accept, Tohru falls down a nearby cliff when the ground collapses in the rain. The accident makes Kyo realize how much he values Tohru, and also allows Akito to finally break away from the roles she has held for most of her life.|$|E

6000|$|Harvey {{smiled at}} the thought of his ten and a half dollars a month, and {{wondered}} what his <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> if she could see him hanging over the edge of a fishing-dory in mid-ocean.

[...] George hated Jack Firebrace and Tom Humbold, and all their like; whereas Harry went out sporting with them, and fowling, and fishing, and cock-fighting, and enjoyed all the fun of the country.|$|E
60|$|We have in {{the last}} three {{chapters}} brought up the history of our characters to the time when our story opens, when Mara and Sally Kittridge were discussing the expected return of Moses. Sally was persuaded by Mara to stay and spend the night with her, and did so without much fear of what her <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> when she returned; for though Mrs. Kittridge still made bustling demonstrations of authority, it was quite evident to every one that the handsome grown-up girl had got the sceptre into her own hands, and was reigning in the full confidence of being, in one way or another, able to bring her mother into all her views.|$|E
60|$|He laughed again, and so offensively that I clapped {{my hand to}} my sword. But before I {{could tell}} him what I thought of his stupidity and rudeness he had wheeled his horse, and was lumbering away down the other road.

From time to time I put my hand to the breast of my tunic and felt the paper crackle beneath my fingers. Ah, my precious paper, which should be turned into the little silver medal for which I had yearned so long. All the way from Braine to Sermoise I was thinking of what my <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> when she saw it.|$|E
5000|$|The reason Wang is {{on stage}} is his mother. He said: [...] "My mother is like my girlfriend. We are very close.

25|$|Cho {{was born}} into a very rich family of six children. His {{grandfather}} was a bank director. During the Korean War, the money the family had owned was burnt and they became impoverished.

6000|$|Whenever a child {{wanted to}} go back from {{dumpling}} and frosted cake to [...] mashed potato and Hubbard squash--they were old-fashioned kind of [...] people, and they had everything on the table at once, because the [...] grandmother and the aunties cooked it, and they couldn't keep jumping [...] up all the time to change the plates--and its mother said it [...] shouldn't, its grandmother said, Indeed it should, then, and helped it [...] herself; and the child's father would say, Well, he guessed he would [...] go back, too, for a change; and the child's <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> She [...] should think he would be ashamed; and then they would get to going [...] back, till everything was perfectly higgledy-piggledy.|$|E

Her <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> words to her which would go through her like swords. Then she opened the door, and for a moment there was the sweetness of an embrace. There was a prolonged tenderness in the kiss which, even to Mrs. Bolton, had a charm for the moment to soften her spirit. 'Oh, mamma; my own mamma!' ...|$|E
50|$|According to Nardoni, he and Jatobá took Pietro and Cauã to the {{apartment}} and when they arrived there, {{he noticed that the}} light in Isabella's room was on. Nardoni said he didn't find Isabella in her bed when he returned to {{the apartment}}, and that she stayed from five to ten minutes on her own; he noticed the hole in the window's safety net, looked out and down and saw Isabella's body on the front yard. He yelled at Jatobá to call his father, which she did, and then she called her own father. Isabella's <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> later <b>say</b> in an interview that Jatobá was hysterical when they spoke on the phone, screaming that Isabella had fallen. According to Oliveira, Jatobá was screaming so much that she had believed Isabella had accidentally fallen into the building's pool and told her to perform CPR on the child.|$|R

5000|$|Her {{most recent}} {{exhibitions}} {{have been at}} the P.P.O.W. Gallery in New York City. What <b>Would</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>Say</b> (2009) featured children engaging in actions which, while innocent, may be construed by adults as provocative or shameful; each work is accompanied by two panels of text. More recently, The Lone Ranger (2013) served as a follow up to What <b>Would</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>Say</b> and included a photo of a boy kissing a horse. According to Attie, that little boy grew up to be the Lone Ranger. Attie expresses that “All of my (her) work is about our hidden selves, the part of us we don’t want to share with others”, and this was her inspiration for “The Lone Ranger”. The overarching idea of the show is that [...] "If a little boy does something, he will {{grow up to be a}} hero. But the little girls, doing the same thing, they all become whores." [...] Attie expresses that “All of my (her) work is about our hidden selves, the part of us we don’t want to share with others”, and this was her inspiration for “The Lone Ranger”. In 2013 she was working on a series of painting called the “Worst Case Scenarios”.|$|R
6000|$|When {{any one of}} the {{children}} violated any rule or direction which had been enjoined upon them--as, for example, when they left the door open in coming in or going out, in the winter; or interrupted their mother when she was reading, instead of standing quietly by her side and waiting until she looked up from her book and gave them leave to speak to her; or used any violence towards each other, by pushing, or pulling, or struggling for a plaything or a place; or did not come promptly to her when called; or did not obey at once the first command in any case, the <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> simply, [...] "Mary!" [...] or [...] "James! Prison!" [...] She would pronounce this sentence without any appearance of displeasure, and often with a smile, as if they were only playing prison, and then, in a very few minutes after they had taken the penitential seat, she would say Free! which word set them at liberty again.|$|E
60|$|Apart {{from this}} {{we had a}} gay day with Uncle Blair. He evidently liked our society better {{than that of the}} grown-ups, for he was a child himself at heart, gay, irresponsible, always acting on the impulse of the moment. We all found him a {{delightful}} companion. There was no school that day, as Mr. Perkins was absent, attending a meeting of the Teachers' Convention, so we spent most of its golden hours in the orchard with Uncle Blair, listening to his fascinating accounts of foreign wanderings. He also drew all our pictures for us, and this was especially delightful, for the day of the camera was only just dawning and none of us had ever had even our photographs taken. Sara Ray's pleasure was, as usual, quite spoiled by wondering what her <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> of it, for Mrs. Ray had, so it appeared, some very peculiar prejudices against the taking or making of any kind of picture whatsoever, owing to an exceedingly strict interpretation of the second commandment. Dan suggested that she need not tell her mother anything about it; but Sara shook her head.|$|E
60|$|The {{sense of}} outrage with which Lemuel was boiling when Miss Vane came in upon Sibyl and himself had wholly passed away, {{and he now}} saw his dismissal, unjust as between that girl and him, unimpeachably righteous as {{between him and the}} moral frame of things. If he had been punished for being ready to take {{advantage}} of that fellow's necessity, and charge him fifty cents for changing ten dollars, he must now be no less obviously suffering for having abused that young lady's trust and defencelessness; only he was not suffering one-tenth as much. When he recurred to that wrong, in fact, and tried to feel sorry for it and ashamed, his heart thrilled in a curious way; he found himself smiling and exulting, and Miss Vane and her niece went out of his mind, and he could not think of anything but of being with that girl, of hearing her talk and laugh, of touching her. He sighed; {{he did not know what}} his <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> if she knew; he did not know where he was going; it seemed a hundred years since the beginning of the afternoon.|$|E

5000|$|McFarland's {{nickname}} [...] "Spanky" [...] is erroneously said to {{have arisen}} from warnings by his mother not to misbehave {{during one of the}} initial discussions with Hal Roach in his office.

[...] While this story has considerable folksy appeal, Spanky himself contradicted the tale, saying that the name was given by a Los Angeles newspaper reporter. The term [...] "a spanky child" [...] was late 19th century-early 20th century slang for an intelligent, gifted toddler. Spanky was an example of such a child in his earliest movies—a toddler who could act—so the name had meaning to the movie-going audience of that era that was lost for later generations. Use of the [...] "Spanky" [...] name by McFarland for subsequent business or personal activities was expressly granted to McFarland in one of his studio contracts. In later years some family members would affectionately refer to him as [...] "Spank." ...|$|R
