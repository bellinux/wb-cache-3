40|$|Abstract Background <b>Micronutrients</b> polyphenols, {{tocopherols}} and phytosterols in rapeseed exert {{potential benefit}} to cardiovascular system, {{but most of}} these <b>micronutrients</b> are removed by the refining process. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of rapeseed oil fortified with these <b>micronutrients</b> on the atherosclerosis risk factors in rats fed a high-fat diet. Methods The rodent diet contained 20 % fat whose source was refined rapeseed oil (RRO) or fortified refined rapeseed oil with low, middle and high quantities of these <b>micronutrients</b> (L-, M- and H-FRRO). Forty male SD rats were divided into four groups. One group received RRO diet and other groups received L-, M- and H-FRRO diet for 10 weeks. Results <b>Micronutrients</b> supplementation significantly increased plasma antioxidant defense capacities, as evaluated by the significant elevation in the activities of GPx, CAT and SOD as well as the level of GSH, and the significant decline in lipid peroxidation. These <b>micronutrients</b> also reduced the plasma contents of TG, TC and LDL-C and increased the ratio of HDL-C/LDL-C. In addition, in parallel with the enhancement of these <b>micronutrients,</b> plasma levels of IL- 6 and CRP declined remarkably. Conclusion Rapeseed oil fortified with <b>micronutrients</b> polyphenols, tocopherols and phytosterols may contribute to prevent atherogenesis by ameliorating plasma oxidative stress, lipid profile and inflammation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>Micronutrients</b> {{play a very}} {{important}} role in both promoting health and curing disease by health professionals. They play a central part in metabolism and in the maintenance of tissue function. It is important that doctors and other health professionals are aware of the evidence for the nutritional essentiality of these substances, and for the situations where an increased intake may lead to clinical benefit. Objectives: 1. To assess the knowledge of health professionals <b>micronutrients</b> and practices in prescribing in treatment. 2. To determine the measures followed by the health professionals in including <b>micronutrients</b> in their own diet. Materials and Methods: A pre-designed and pre-tested anonymous self administered questionnaire was used in a cross sectional study. Results: 70 % of doctors said that they had enough knowledge about prescribing and counseling to patients regarding <b>micronutrients.</b> On comparing the knowledge of specialists about <b>micronutrients</b> with the general practitioners we didn’t find any significant increase in knowledge with specialization. A large section of doctors 95 % of agreed that nutrition {{plays an important role in}} treatment and prescription and counseling of <b>micronutrients</b> is needed. But 82 % of doctors are not sure and 8 % even strongly disagreed if their patients will follow a diet plan even if given. Most of the study participants felt they were not up-to-date about <b>micronutrients.</b> Majority of them attributed this to lack of time and being unaware of any structured resource. Conclusion There is a need to restructure about imparting <b>micronutrients</b> education among doctors. Greater efforts should be aimed towards imparting updates about <b>micronutrients</b> in doctors and other health professionals enable them to contribute positively towards a healthy society.
