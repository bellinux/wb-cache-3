40|$|There is {{currently}} no uniform social security dispute resolution system in South Africa {{due to the}} piecemeal fashion in which schemes were established or protection against individual risks regulated. The result is that each statute provides for its own dispute resolution institution(s) and processes. There are also various gaps and challenges in the current social security dispute resolution systems, some of these relating to the uncoordinated and fragmented nature of the system; inaccessibility of some social security institutions; inappropriateness of some current appeal institutions; {{the lack of a}} systematic approach in establishing appeal institutions; a limited scope of jurisdiction and powers of adjudication institutions; inconsistencies in review and/or appeal provisions in various laws; <b>an</b> <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> alternative dispute resolution procedures; and an absence of institutional independence of adjudication institutions or forums.

In the present study, talc was not used as a pleurodesing agent due to <b>an</b> <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> its sterile and pure form in Iran. Methods Overall, 75 adult male Spraque-Dawley rats were randomized to 5 treatment groups.

40|$|Coignimbrite plumes {{provide a}} common and {{effective}} {{mechanism by which}} large volumes of fine-grained ash are injected into the atmosphere. Nevertheless, controls on formation of these plumes {{as a function of}} eruptive conditions are still poorly constrained. Herein, two 1 -D axysymmetric steady state models were coupled, the first describing the parent pyroclastic density current and the second describing plume rise. Global sensitivity analysis is applied to investigate controls on coignimbrite plume formation and describe coignimbrite source and the maximum plume height attained. For a range of initial mass flow rates between 108 and 1010 kg/s, modeled liftoff distance (the distance at which neutral buoyancy is attained), assuming radial supercritical flow, is controlled by the initial flow radius, gas mass fraction, flow thickness, and temperature. The predicted decrease in median grain size between flow initiation and plume liftoff is negligible. Calculated initial plume vertical velocities, assuming uniform liftoff velocity over the pyroclastic density current invasion area, are much greater (several tens of m/s) than those previously used in modeling coignimbrite plumes (1 m/s). Such velocities are inconsistent with the fine grain size of particles lofted into coignimbrite plumes, highlighting <b>an</b> <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> large clasts, possibly due to particle segregation within the flow, prior to plume formation. Source radius and initial vertical velocity have the largest effect on maximum plume height, closely followed by initial temperature. Modeled plume heights are between 25 and 47 km, comparable with Plinian eruption columns, highlighting the potential of such events for distributing fine-grained ash over significant areas...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} ways in which {{theatrical}} techniques might intervene in the representational operations of monuments. As illustrated by the controversy surrounding nearly every aspect of the memorial to the destroyed World Trade Center, monumentality implies a finality <b>of</b> meaning and <b>an</b> <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> monumental spaces to open and fluctuating meanings. Henri Lefebvre’s distinction between ‘representations of space’ and ‘representational space’ suggests a method for unsettling or rewriting these meanings, which Joanne Tompkins develops as an analytical tool in her consideration of contemporary Australian theatre. However, Tinderbox Theatre Company’s production of convictionsin a decommissioned courthouse in Belfast demonstrates that theatrical representations may have the effect of displacing previous spatial practices, but they also have their own authorizing norms and associated codes of meaning and behaviour. Using Doreen Massey’s concept of ‘relational space’ to augment Lefebvre’s categories, a set of criteria can be articulated for counter-monumental theatre that is attentive to the politics of openness and closure. And While London Burns, a downloadable audio tour of the financial centre of London produced by John Jordan and PLATFORM, is used {{as an example of a}} theatrical event which creates relational spaces that intervene within the normative mechanisms both of corporate organization of urban space and of dramatic narrative.

The resultant radioautographs show diffusion gradients in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and concentration gradients across the nuclear envelope Analysis of these gradients discloses that the nuclear envelope is as permeable as a comparable structure composed of cytoplasm, and is about 108 times more permeable than the oocyte plasma membrane The diffusion coefficient of sucrose in cytoplasm is 2 x 10 - 6 cm 2 /sec, or about one-third its diffusivity in pure water. This reduction can probably {{be accounted for by}} an effective lengthening of the diffusional path because of obstruction by cytoplasmic inclusions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} from a recent meta-analysis of pediatric antidepressant trials if a general property of antidepressant medications [...] the multiple-dosing medication half-life [...] is associated with risks for suicidal ideation or behavior. METHODS: Relative risks for suicidal behavior (ideation, attempt, or preparation) for seven antidepressants were obtained from both the FDA 2 ̆ 7 s initial and published versions of their pediatric antidepressant meta-analysis. The correlation between the relative risk for suicidal behavior and antidepressant half-life was examined using a nonparametric test, Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rho. RESULTS: A significant correlation (rho= 0. 929; p= 0. 003) was observed for the initial analysis, as previously reported by Weiss and Gorman. The correlation was robust {{to a change in}} the suicidality ranking for the longest half-life medication, fluoxetine, that occurred when results from the Treatment of Adolescent Depression Study (TADS) were included in the published meta-analysis (rho= 0. 786, p= 0. 036). LIMITATIONS: In addition to limitations common to meta-analyses, our analysis has additional uncertainties including the fact that adult, rather than pediatric, antidepressant half-life data were used due to <b>an</b> <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> published information. In addition, risks for suicidal ideation/behavior may vary for reasons other than half-life (e. g. study eligibility criteria, illness severity or responsiveness to treatment, diagnoses, etc.). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of suicidal ideation or behavior in short-term antidepressant trials involving children or adolescents, as defined in the recent FDA meta-analysis, appears to be potentially at least partly associated with antidepressant half-life. Although any relationship is tentative, approaches to investigating several potential candidate mechanisms for any association are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Uhralow {{temperature}} radioautography, {{suitable for}} the quantitative locahzation of diffusible solutes, was used to study the permeabihty of the nuclear envelope in the intact amphibian oocyte Sucrose-*H solutions were injected into mature oocytes, m volumes of 0 016 - 0 14 % of that of the cell, and the subsequent movement of the solute was recorded. The resultant radioautographs show diffusion gradmnts in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and concentration gradients across the nuclear envelope Analysis of these gradients discloses that the nuclear envelope is as permeable as a comparable structure composed of cytoplasm, and is about l 0 s times more permeable than the oocyte plasma membrane The diffusion coefficient of sucrose in cytoplasm is 2 X 10 - 6 cm 2 /sec, or about one-third its diffusivity in pure water. This reduction can probably {{be accounted for by}} an effective lengthening of the dlffusional path because of obstruction by cytoplasmic inclusions. The nuclear: cytoplasmic sucrose concentration ratio at diffusional equilibrium is about 3 05, or 1. 6 times as great as expected from the water content of the two compartments This asymmetry is attributed to <b>an</b> <b>unavailability</b> <b>of</b> 36 % of the cytoplasmic water as solvent Finally, sucrose entry into oocytes from a bathing solution was monitored by whole cell analysis and radioautography. These and the microinjection results are consistent with a modet in which sucrose entry into the cell ts entirely limited by the permeabihty of the plasma membrane. The resuhs are inconsistent with ceil models that hypothesize a short-circmt transport route from the extracellular compartment to the nucleus, and with models in which cytoplasmic diffusion is viewed as limiting the rate of solute permeation.
