40|$|Abstract Background Due {{to lack of}} {{culturally}} relevant assessment tools, {{little is known about}} children’s developmental profiles in low income settings such as Ethiopia. The objective {{of this study was to}} adapt and standardize the Denver II for assessing child development in Jimma Zone, South West Ethiopia. Methods Culture-specific test items in Denver II were modified. After translation into two local languages, all test items were piloted and fine-tuned. Using 1597 healthy children 4  days to 70. 6  months of age, the 25, 50, 75 and 90  % passing ages were determined for each test item as milestones. Milestones attainment on the adapted version and the Denver II were compared on the 90  % passing age. Reliability of the adapted tool was examined. Results A total of 36 (28. 8  %) test items, <b>mostly</b> from <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> domain, were adapted. Milestones attainment ages on the two versions differed significantly on 42 (34  %) test items. The adapted tool has an excellent inter-rater on 123 (98  %) items and substantial to excellent test-retest reliability on 119 (91  %) items. Conclusions A Western developmental assessment tool can be adapted reliably for use in low-income settings. Age differences in attaining milestones indicate a correct estimation of child development requires a population-specific standard...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years or so, the subject of <b>Personal,</b> <b>Social,</b> Health and Citizenship Education has been {{developed}} in secondary schools in England as part of the curriculum of pastoral care. David Fincham argues that, where Catholic secondary schools are concerned, the development of <b>Personal,</b> <b>Social,</b> Health and Citizenship Education has been problematic and that the subject has challenged traditional and hierarchical perspectives in these schools. Consequently, divergences have appeared in the perceptions of members of the Catholic community towards what <b>Personal,</b> <b>Social,</b> Health and Citizenship Education should achieve...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 1980 s, the {{introduction}} of market mechanisms in the public sector has been a dominant feature in Sweden. The same is true for the social services in several municipalities, where business style behaviour and organisation, and competition have become salient features of market-oriented social services. The aim of the study is to describe and analyse: the structural conditions for market oriented <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> services; how social workers pursue client centred work in market oriented <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> services; the consequences of this market orientation on the <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> services. The empirical study is a case study of the <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> services in the municipality of Linköping. The purchaser-provider model in Linköping {{is one of the most}} advanced and discussed in Sweden. The research comprises a quantitative pilot study and a qualitative main study. The main study is based on twenty semi-structured interviews with experienced social workers and their immediate superiors. The analysis of the interviews reveals that the <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> services are only achieving to a lesser extent the ends that a quasi-market, theoretically, should achieve. The conditions that have to be satisfied to achieve the ends of the quasi-market are only partly met. Bureaucratic control is one important reason why the <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> services are imperfect as a quasi- market. The re-organisation has resulted in a number of, to some extent, positive consequences. The re-organisation has, however, also resulted in some negative consequences. In the thesis these are categorised in terms of fragmentation, antagonism and obscurity. A linguistic change, in market oriented <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> services, appears to have influenced social workers to think and act differently in relation to their work. The most important conclusion drawn from the study is that the market oriented <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> services partly function as a responsive quasi-market for strong, rational and well- informed clients. However, in relation to the most vulnerable, it is failing in many respects. digitalisering@um...|$|R

40|$|Women middle {{managers}} aspiring for senior management execute their career choices {{in a unique}} career context. They experience the influence of <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> support and non-support in executing their aspirations towards senior management. Yet, {{it is observed that}} measures available to capture <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> support and non-support of this cohort of careerist are not adequately comprehensive. It was felt that there is a considerable space to develop a measure on <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> support and non-support as a contextual factor that affects career choice of women in middle management aspiring for senior management. This paper aims to highlight possible multiple dimensions of <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> support and non-support that affect career aspirations towards senior management amongst women in middle management. Concurrently, it offers some recommendations to develop a measure to capture aforementioned phenomena. To fulfill above aims, a targeted literature review on main areas under discussion was carried out in leading scientific databases such as EBSCOhost, JSTOR, ProQuest, Science Direct, and SpingerLink with the use of key words: women, career choice, aspirations, management, leadership, social support, significant others, and measurement. It is believed that development of a measure to capture the influence of <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> support and non-support in career aspirations towards senior management amongst women in middle management might contribute to enhance the quality of research conducted in this area and intervention programmes taken up to support female senior management aspirants...|$|R
