40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in the development of biodegradable implants for bone fracture repair. Magnesium (Mg) is a promising candidate for these applications, due to its good biocompatibility, biodegradability and favourable mechanical properties. However, pure Mg degrades too rapidly under physiological conditions. There has been a large amount of research done recently to mitigate the degradation rate of Mg {{in order to make it}} a viable biomaterial. This is done primarily through the use of either alloying with other metals, or through a protective coating that degrades at a <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> <b>rate.</b> To date, {{there has been}} limited success in achieving acceptable degradation behaviour through either alloying or coatings. This work was concentrated on two areas: (i) mechanistic understanding of the degradation of Mg-based alloys in physiological conditions, and (ii) utilising partially protective coatings to improve the degradation behaviour of Mg-based alloys. This work culminated in further understanding of the effects of surface roughness and microgalvanic effects of degradation behaviour of Mg alloys, and a novel coating that provided a significantly improved degradation rate for Mg-based alloys. The influence of surface roughness on the passivation and pitting degradation behaviour of AZ 91 Mg alloy in chloride-containing and simulated body fluid (SBF) environments was found to play a critical role on the initial breakdown of the passive layer and the subsequent localised pitting attack. In chloride environment, potentiodyanamic polarisation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests suggested that the passivation behaviour of the alloy was affected by increasing the surface roughness. Similarly, in SBF the polarisation resistance (R(P)) of the rough surface alloy immersed in SBF for 3 h was 30...|$|E

The fiscal advantages designed to encourage the growth of tourist activities have an influence upon a fiscal cost by reducing the taxable base and implicitly lowering companies’ fiscal spending. Fiscal costs are a representative element of any business’ or transaction’s costs. Reducing a company’s fiscal costs allows the amounts saved thereof to be reoriented to new growth opportunities.

The {{aim of this study}} is to explore pricing of currency exchange services based on bid-ask differences in some commercial banks and possible price discrimination in this segment of market comparing the behaviour of Western mothers and Eastern daughters in European international banking groups. The retail currency rate spreads in different bank groups and countries are compared with each other. The main results of the study are that statistically significant differences exist in the spreads set by banking groups in different countries. All banking groups in the pilot sample offer <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> <b>rates</b> in Western countries indicating that the pricing policy of bank groups may be discriminatory.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{looks at}} several {{measures}} of competitiveness for the Japanese manufacturing sector {{relative to the}} United States over the period 1980 - 2000. Using industry-specific unit-value ratios (UVRs) we show that labour productivity in Japanese manufacturing lags considerably behind the U. S. and that the Japanese position has worsened during the 1990 s. In 2000, value added per hour worked in Japanese manufacturing stood at 72 percent of the U. S. level after peaking at 79 percent in 1991. Underneath this aggregate estimate though, {{there is a wide}} range of branch-specific labour productivity levels. Japanese manufacturing has also suffered from rising unit labour cost levels. The long-term trend of a strengthening yen has eroded Japanese cost competitiveness in nearly all branches between 1980 and 2000, although ULC levels have declined somewhat from 1995 onwards due to a <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> exchange <b>rate</b> development and moderate wage growth in Japan. Still, in 2000 unit labour cost in Japanese manufacturing was still 27 percent above the U. S. level. In comparison, in 1980 Japanese unit labour cost stood at only 82 percent of the U.

40|$|Orientation: Nurse {{recruitment}} to {{and participation}} in empirical research is increasingly important in understanding and improving nursing practice. However, the low participation and recruitment rate amongst nurses is not well understood. Research purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate three research recruitment methods for their impact on recruitment and participation rates amongst South African nurses. Motivation for the study: A limited number of studies exist that formally evaluates different recruitment strategies to improve participation in research amongst nurses within developing contexts, especially South Africa. Research approach, design and method: Participants were recruited using three different methods. Of the 250 nurses randomly selected and invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey, 201 agreed and 162 (81 %) returned the questionnaires. Main findings: Nursing management participation in the recruitment and data collection process produces <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> response <b>rates.</b> Reminders and the use of shorter questionnaires also aid higher response rates. Practical/managerial implications: Reminders as well as face-to-face recruitment strategies (especially by a familiar person) successfully improved participation rates amongst South African nurses in this study. Contribution/value-add: This study identifies some strategies that could be used more widely to increase the recruitment and participation of South African nurses in research whilst potentially improving their work situation. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Frozen embryo {{transfer}} {{is an important}} supplementary procedure {{in the treatment of}} infertility. While general information concerning the outcome of frozen {{embryo transfer}} has been documented, few studies have addressed the potential of embryo implantation in particular clinical situations. Importantly, the risk of multiple conception following frozen embryo transfer has been poorly documented compared with the information available for fresh embryo transfer. METHODS: This is a retrospective study analysing 3570 frozen embryo transfer cycles (1438 couples) with a view to increasing our understanding of the clinical circumstances that influence the potential for embryo implantation. RESULTS: The overall implantation rate was 9. 1 %. The characteristics associated with a <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> implantation <b>rate</b> were the success of the previous fresh embryo transfer cycle, age < 40 years and non-tubal factor aetiology of infertility. Such women had an increased risk of multiple conception. CONCLUSION: Female age, the aetiology of infertility and the outcome of fresh embryo transfer are the most important factors influencing the implantation rate following frozen embryo transfer. A prognostic table has been constructed that may assist with the determination of the optimal number of embryos to be replaced in frozen embryo transfer to provide better individualized counselling and to secure an optimal chance of pregnancy while reducing the risk of multiple conception.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{determinants}} {{of the recent}} boom-and-bust cycle of the Lithuanian economy {{with the help of}} a medium-sized macroeconometric model that incorporates a functional financial block. Special emphasis is put on the role of credit market conditions during the overheating episode. We quantitatively estimate the impact of credit conditions and externally funded bank lending on macroeconomic developments. There is evidence that easy credit conditions and active credit expansion contributed moderately to real economic growth but significantly added to overheating pressures by pushing up real estate prices, encouraging concentration of labour and capital into procyclical sectors and increasing private sector’s debt burden. During the boom episode buoyant external environment provided strong background for export-led growth, which was later strongly affected by temporary foreign trade collapse at the outset of the economic crisis. Model results also suggest that government’s discretionary fiscal policies may have contributed to economic overheating and severity of the ensuing crisis by not adopting sufficiently prudent fiscal stance during the boom episode. The model confirms that <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> interest <b>rate</b> environment and accommodating fiscal policies are important for providing a temporary relief for the crisis-stricken economy but deep structural transformation of the economy is needed for the sustainable recovery to take hold. structural macroeconometric modelling, macrofinancial linkages, economic cycles, credit, banking sector, housing price bubble...|$|R

Background: Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is now an integral part of the treatment of high-risk solid tumours in children. However, specific characteristics and problems related to paediatric patients must be taken into account. Considering these tumours are rare, indications, efficacy and practical issues of autologous transplantation have been a topic of research and discussion. Results: We analysed 46 children with high-risk solid tumours and lymphomas, with a median age of 5. 4 years who underwent AHSCT without tumour cell purging. Median follow-up of patients after AHSCT was 37. 5 months. There were no lethal outcomes due to high-dose chemotherapy toxicity or transplantation-related consequences. 11 patients (23. 9 %) died while 35 (76. 1 %) out of 46 patients survived. Overall five-year survival of all transplanted patients was 73 %. There was a significant difference in the survival of neuroblastoma patients compared to the remainder of solid tumour patients (82 % vs. 38 %, log-rank test Χ 2 = 6. 86, P< 0. 01). Unlike lymphoma and neuroblastoma patients, the worst survival rates were amongst patients with brain tumours and rhabdomyosarcoma.

40|$|Mortality among 10 {{groups of}} non-western {{migrants}} to The Netherlands, {{observed in the}} period 1995 - 2000, is compared with mortality among people who were born in and whose parents were born in The Netherlands. The migrant groups concerned consisted {{of people who were}} born in, or whose parents were born in Turkey, Morocco, Surinam, The Netherlands Antilles, Ghana, Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Vietnam. Differences in mortality were adjusted for age, marital status, region, degree of urbanization, and socioeconomic status. Despite the fact that most migrants originate from countries with a substantially higher mortality rate than The Netherlands, most groups had similar or <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> total mortality <b>rates</b> than native Dutch people. Men from Turkey and Surinam had slightly elevated mortality rates and men and women from Somalia had a notably higher mortality rate than native Dutch people. The generally <b>favourable</b> mortality <b>rates</b> among migrants are the result of two compensating phenomena: higher mortality among young migrants than among young native Dutch people, and lower mortality among elderly migrants than among elderly native Dutch people. An analysis of cause-of-death patterns revealed relatively low mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer and respiratory diseases in most migrant groups, and relatively high mortality from infectious diseases and injuries. These findings are unlikely to have been influenced by incomplete registration of mortality. Selective migration may play a role [...] some migrant groups have a relatively high level of education for example. Also some of the findings may be explained by a difference in timing between the health benefits and the health risks of migration. Migrant health could be benefiting from the favourable socioeconomic, public health and health-care conditions in The Netherlands, but not yet be affected by the higher risks of cancer and cardiovascular disease associated with prosperit...|$|R
40|$|From {{both the}} {{perspectives}} of European integration and human rights, migrant health and {{access to health care}} are important elements of national health policy. However, many EU Member States have not addressed, or have only recently begun to address this issue. Relatively {{little is known about the}} health of migrants. Measurement is challenging for a variety of technical and political reasons. The data that is available gives rise to a complex picture; the health of migrants and access issues vary across space, time, age, gender, across different countries of origin and type of migration. Disease specific mortality rates for certain conditions are higher for immigrants. Despite the fact that most migrants originate from countries with a substantially higher mortality rate than Europe, many studies have found that immigrant groups have similar or <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> total mortality <b>rates</b> than native Europeans. However, the health advantage is confined to specific diseases. Furthermore, in many contexts the advantage disappears in the second generation and with increased duration of stay. The possible reasons for inequalities in health care use between migrants and autochthonous populations are complicated. Data in some countries suggests that utilization of health services among migrants tends to be relatively low, with a greater reliance on emergency services. Particularly worrisome are the low rates of utilization of antenatal and paediatric care. Barriers to access are thought to include education, cultural differences, language difficulties, lack of complimentary voluntary health insurance and legal issues. The other major issue i...|$|R
