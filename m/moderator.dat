5|$|In {{these early}} days we {{explored}} {{all sorts of}} power reactors, comparing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each type. The number of possibilities was enormous, since there are many possibilities for each component of a reactor—fuel, coolant, <b>moderator.</b> The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; the coolant may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; the <b>moderator</b> may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no <b>moderator.</b> I have calculated that, if one counted all the combinations of fuel, coolant, and <b>moderator,</b> one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, at the very beginning of nuclear power, we had to choose which possibilities to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the {{reactors}} for plutonium production involved several problems, not just in nuclear physics but in engineering and construction. Issues such as the long-term effect of radiation on materials received considerable attention from the Metallurgical Laboratory. Two types of reactors were considered: homogeneous, in which the <b>moderator</b> and fuel were mixed together, and heterogeneous, in which the <b>moderator</b> and fuel were arranged in a lattice configuration. By late 1941, mathematical analysis had shown that the lattice design had advantages over the homogeneous type, {{and so it was}} chosen for CP-1, and for the later production reactors as well. For a neutron <b>moderator,</b> graphite was chosen {{on the basis of its}} availability compared with beryllium or heavy water.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{area of research}} concerned the Wigner effect. Under bombardment by neutrons, the carbon atoms in the graphite <b>moderator</b> can be knocked out of the graphite's crystalline structure. Over time, this causes the graphite to heat and swell. Investigation of the problem would take most of 1946 before a fix was found.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} discovery Wigner {{made during}} the project was the Wigner effect. This is a swelling of the graphite <b>moderator</b> caused by the displacement of atoms by neutron radiation. The Wigner effect was a serious problem for the reactors at the Hanford Site in the immediate post-war period, and resulted in production cutbacks and a reactor being shut down entirely. It was eventually discovered {{that it could be}} overcome by controlled heating and annealing.|$|E

5000|$|... ===Summary=== Overall, {{there are}} few <b>moderators</b> of the BFLPE, and they mostly have small effect sizes. They have only been shown to alter the {{strength}} of the BFLPE, not to reverse its direction. However, <b>moderators</b> of the BFLPE continue to be an active area of research because of their theoretical implications. Identifying <b>moderators</b> may help to discover the psychological mechanism underlying the BFLPE. From a practical perspective, a more thorough understanding of the <b>moderators</b> of the BFLPE could lead to {{the development and implementation of}} educational policies that less the negative impacts or enhance the positive effects of the BFLPE.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{and describe the}} activities performed by online support community <b>moderators.</b> Methods: A total of 790 messages were downloaded for analysis. Messages were written by 59 <b>moderators</b> from 6 forums that represent a diverse range of conditions (arthritis, complex regional pain syndrome, Crohn’s disease, depression, diabetes and Huntington’s disease).

5|$|Szilárd {{teamed up}} with Fermi {{to build a nuclear}} reactor from natural uranium at Columbia University, where they were {{fortunate}} in having a sympathetic head of the physics department in George B. Pegram. At the time there was disagreement about whether it was uranium-235, which made up less than 1% of natural uranium, or the more abundant uranium-238 isotope, as Fermi maintained, that was primarily responsible for fission. Fermi and Szilárd conducted a series of experiments, and concluded that a chain reaction in natural uranium could be possible if they could find a suitable neutron <b>moderator.</b> They found that the hydrogen atoms in water slowed neutrons, but tended to capture them. Szilárd then suggested using carbon as a <b>moderator.</b> They now needed large quantities of carbon and uranium to create a reactor. Szilárd was convinced that they would succeed if only they could get the materials.|$|E
