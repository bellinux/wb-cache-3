40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis assignment {{handles the}} project of the multifunctional house, located in the southeastern part near the Brno city center. The object is located between the Kopečná street and the Studánka street under the Šilinger square. Surrounding development consists of residential and office buildings. The proposed solution {{is based on the}} current parcel situation and of the overall situation of place. Location of parcel in the given locality reflects overall character and incorporation of the building to the existing built. The object is accessible through the both streets. Material solution of the object is based on the irregular height of neighboring buildings. The building is designed as a longitudinal wall system. Layout of the interior is designed as a dispozitional double tracts. Architectonic solution and interior layout reflects the nature of the neighboring low-rise buildings situated on the south side. On the second floor is proposed coffee shop. For the remaining floors are designed flats of various categories. Outward of the object is made with white <b>masonry</b> <b>paint,</b> partly for its modern look and partly for its neutrality to the nearby development, combined with travertine paneling...|$|E
40|$|In {{cases where}} {{concrete}} {{has to be}} repaired or protected due to exposure to an aggressive environment, a protective coating is often used. The guidelines referenced {{on the subject of}} repairs and coatings of concrete require the substrate must be clean, dry and free from loose material but no mention is made of a preferred method of surface preparation. This research report presents details of an investigation in which concrete was subjected to different curing regimes in order to induce different qualities of surface concrete. The different surface qualities were prepared using four alternative surface preparation methods prior to coating. After an initial investigation, five different coatings were chosen in order to cover a broad spectrum of coatings available to the construction industry. Once the applied coatings had cured they were tested using a pull-off testing device to determine the adhesion properties. The mode of failure was determined by visual examination. In addition, surface characteristics were determined using an optical microscope and the water sorptivity test. Results indicate that preparing the surface before application of coatings does improve adhesion. The preparation that was easiest to carry out, and which also gave the best adhesion results, was the wire brushing technique. Considering the practicality for site application, the mechanical method would be most appropriate. From the findings, aliphatic coating exhibited the best adhesion properties, while epoxy resin and cementitious-based materials also gave satisfactory results. B T Benn 7231599 iii Elastomeric coating with lower adhesion strengths at early ages may be suited to surfaces that are expected to crack, as the elastic nature of the material will bridge the gap. <b>Masonry</b> <b>paint,</b> which was only used for comparative purpose did not perform as well as expected and had the lowest bond strengths. Where the removal of defective concrete is likely to result in a rough surface the cementitious material may be preferable...|$|E

50|$|Stone and masonry veneer is {{sometimes}} considered siding, are varied and can accommodate {{a variety of}} styles—from formal to rustic. Though <b>masonry</b> can be <b>painted</b> or tinted to match many color palettes, it is most suited to neutral earth tones, and coatings such as roughcast and pebbeldash. Masonry has excellent durability (over 100 years), and minimal maintenance is required. The primary drawback to masonry siding is the initial cost.|$|R

Metal {{railings}} surround the memorial, which comprises a <b>painted</b> <b>masonry</b> obelisk decorated very simply with a border of acanthus below the plinth on which the shaft rests. The memorial below this is square in section with a plaque to each face, two of which are inscribed in memory of Sir Joshua Peter Bell who died in 1881 and of his son Joshua Thomas Bell who died in 1911. A third plaque was inscribed in memory of Lady Bell in 2002. The other face is blank.|$|R
5000|$|Basic {{preservation}} of lighthouse masonry usually includes gentle surface cleaning. Appropriate methods for cleaning {{are determined by}} the type of masonry that exists on the building. Some cleaning methods include water, chemical, and laser. [...] There are multiple water cleaning methods. Soaking is a process where the masonry undergoes a prolonged exposure to misting water to remove dirt. Water washing uses a light to medium pressurized stream of water. Some water washing may use the addition of detergents to increase dirt removal. Chemical cleaning is also an option, but may be too harsh depending on the makeup of the masonry. Chemical cleaners are either acidic or alkaline. Laser cleaning is effective, mostly on smaller areas of masonry, but can be costly. Occasionally, a lighthouse may be weatherproofed through covering the <b>masonry</b> with <b>paint,</b> stucco, or whitewash/lime mortar wash; but only if these are historically accurate for the structure. Due to the differences in materials and construction techniques, only an experienced architectural conservator should be contacted for conservation or restoration work.|$|R
