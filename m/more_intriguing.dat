5|$|Beginning {{in about}} 1950, with the {{publication}} of Psychology of Colonization by Octave Mannoni, The Tempest was viewed more and more through the lens of postcolonial theory. This new {{way of looking at the}} text explored the effect of the coloniser (Prospero) on the colonised (Ariel and Caliban). Though Ariel is often overlooked in these debates in favour of the <b>more</b> <b>intriguing</b> Caliban, he is nonetheless an essential component of them. The French writer Aimé Césaire, in his play Une Tempête sets The Tempest in Haiti, portraying Ariel as a mulatto who, unlike the more rebellious Caliban, feels that negotiation and partnership is the way to freedom from the colonisers. Fernandez Retamar sets his version of the play in Cuba, and portrays Ariel as a wealthy Cuban (in comparison to the lower-class Caliban) who also must choose between rebellion or negotiation. Although scholars have suggested that his dialogue with Caliban in Act two, Scene one, contains hints of a future alliance between the two when Prospero leaves, Ariel is generally viewed by scholars as the good servant, in comparison with the conniving Caliban—a view which Shakespeare's audience may well have shared. Ariel is used by some postcolonial writers as a symbol of their efforts to overcome the effects of colonisation on their culture. For example, Michelle Cliff, a Jamaican author, has said that she tries to combine Caliban and Ariel within herself to create a way of writing that represents her culture better. Such use of Ariel in postcolonial thought is far from uncommon; the spirit is even the namesake of a scholarly journal covering post-colonial criticism.|$|E

50|$|Also partaking {{in these}} {{sessions}} is Beineberg (Bernd Tischer), with whom Törless visits Bozena (Barbara Steele), the local prostitute. Again, Törless is aloof and <b>more</b> <b>intrigued</b> than {{excited by the}} woman.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, Stewart Alsop II {{realized}} he was <b>more</b> <b>intrigued</b> by the one-on-one demonstrations of coming technologies conducted in hallways and hotel rooms during the off hours during technology conferences. This prompted Alsop to found the first DEMO Conference in 1991.|$|R
25|$|But mostly Against the Wall is a {{pleasant}} surprise, with Carpani being {{a much bigger}} surprise. If Against the Wall can make its disparate parts work, it will be plenty <b>more</b> <b>intriguing</b> than a number of network procedurals. And in the cable game, that's already a victory.|$|E
25|$|In November 1916, she was {{travelling}} by steamer from Spain {{when her}} ship called at the British port of Falmouth. There {{she was arrested}} and brought to London where she was interrogated at length by Sir Basil Thomson, Assistant Commissioner at New Scotland Yard in charge of counter-espionage. He gave an account of this in his 1922 book Queer People, saying that she eventually admitted to working for the Deuxième Bureau. Initially detained in Cannon Street police station, she was then released and stayed at the Savoy Hotel. A full transcript of the interview is in Britain's National Archives and was broadcast, with Mata Hari played by Eleanor Bron, on the independent station LBC in 1980. It is unclear if she lied on this occasion, believing the story made her sound <b>more</b> <b>intriguing,</b> or if French authorities were using her {{in such a way}} but would not acknowledge her due to the embarrassment and international backlash it could cause.|$|E

And the thing is, what she had talked about as well, is that before a concert, what she finds very interesting is the rehearsals and the straining and maybe {{she would like to}} injure.

A vague Saturday night TV, family entertainment feel gradually gives way to a <b>more</b> <b>intriguing</b> cross between Liza Minnelli showbiz and thumping R However, a ticker tape festooned 'Crazy in Love' and a belting 'Work It Out' suggest Beyoncé is best sticking to her roots. Bizarrely, if implausibly, she puts the carnage down to her tour manager falling off stage, but at least she's grasped one showbiz adage: the show must go on." ...|$|E
500|$|David Eick {{found the}} episode to be a [...] "standalone concept" [...] {{that did not}} require having seen the miniseries to {{understand}} it. [...] Because the miniseries ended [...] "at a very happy place", starting the series {{in the middle of}} a crisis without explanation, and showing the audience that [...] "actually, while youthe audiencewere away, really bad things have been happening" [...] made for a much <b>more</b> <b>intriguing</b> and interesting story. [...] "33s complex storyline was a harbinger for episodes to come, and laid the groundwork with the network and audiences alike.|$|E

5000|$|The Beast Within has a {{much more}} {{involved}} plot than its predecessor, Sins of the Fathers. Jane Jensen {{said that this was}} because the FMV graphics [...] "limited the interactivity we could do.

500|$|The {{decision}} {{to replace the}} departing Conrad with Cavallari halfway through the fifth season was met with a mixed response. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly expressed interest in the route the series would take, writing that the latter would [...] "be fully prepared to stir things up". After the premiere of the first episode under her lead, a writer from PopSugar criticized Cavallari's [...] "sassy, bad-girl attitude" [...] for lacking originality and preferred Conrad for [...] " [...] it real". In contrast, Amy Kaufman from Los Angeles Times opined that Cavallari was <b>more</b> <b>intriguing</b> than Conrad, whose storylines she felt had been overshadowed as the series progressed.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Nerdist, Joseph McCabe {{praised the}} {{chemistry}} between the series' main characters {{and the performance}} of Jansen as Aida, but said [...] "most of this is just preamble to the sight of two guys with a lot of attitude and similar pyrokinetic powers unleashing holy hell on one another in a building chock full of explosives. I am [...] than okay with this." [...] The A.V. Clubs Alex McLevy graded the episode a 'B', praising the episode for focusing the season's overarching storyline and for the emotional reunions between Johnson and the core S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. He was positive of the ongoing Ghost Rider storyline and the episode's action sequences, but thought Aida's story was [...] "the much <b>more</b> <b>intriguing</b> long-term story ... it offers the unusual opportunity for Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. to dig into some juicy subtext and weighty concepts".|$|E
500|$|Todd's {{long hair}} was also {{integral}} to the character. It was described by Soap Opera Magazine as [...] "enigmatic, {{with an air of}} innate authority". The hair was said to demonstrate Todd's lack of pretense and to convey an [...] "I don't care" [...] attitude. [...] Todd's [...] "overhanging brow" [...] seemed threatening, but instead concealed the [...] "intense, vulnerable eyes underneath", features that contrasted well with the character's [...] "pouty, sensual mouth". The features, which conferred [...] "a charming, boyish quality", could sometimes convey that Todd was less dangerous than he actually was. Photographer Robert Milazzo believed Howarth's hair softened Todd's character. [...] "You don't expect that intensity because of it," [...] he said, and felt that it made Todd <b>more</b> <b>intriguing.</b> Milazzo also stated that the combination of Todd's soft hair and intensity made Todd [...] "a very complex character to look at".|$|E

500|$|In contrast, Amy Kaufman from Los Angeles Times {{opined that}} Cavallari was <b>more</b> <b>intriguing</b> than Conrad, whose storylines she felt had been overshadowed as the series progressed. Tracie Egan Morrissey of Jezebel commented that she [...] "kind of [...] Kristin", {{and was glad}} to see her {{replacing}} Conrad. Julie Miller from Movieline was critical of the episode's [...] "staged showdowns", but nonetheless noted that the series [...] "continues to compel" [...] like professional wrestling and enjoyed a scene in which Jenner became irritated with Nicole, labeling it the sole genuine reaction of the episode. Writing for Homorazzi, Patrick [...] "loved this episode", and expressed an interest in the love triangle that seemingly develops between Cavallari, Jenner, and Nicole.

500|$|Jeff Nelson from People {{found that}} [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] {{serves as a}} {{reminder}} that [...] "she's still a person". Nelson went on stating that [...] "it's tracks like the aforementioned 'Wash All Over Me' [...] that showcase the megastar's vulnerable, relatable side". Brad Stern, an editor and publisher for MuuMuse, commented that [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] was [...] "very Confessions-esque", further calling it [...] "a truly curious concoction of sound". In response to a fan of the singer, Stern agreed that it was [...] "fabulous and very emotional", and opined that [...] "the lyrics are much <b>more</b> <b>intriguing</b> than, say, taking shots of Tanqueray like a girl gone wild." [...] Nouses Jack Elliott applauded [...] "Wash All Over Me", describing it as [...] "a lyrically powerful, yet vulnerable ending to the album that could be interpreted as a track celebrating triumph or defeat. It is up to you to interpret it as you wish." ...|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen, {{who watched}} the episode for The A.V. Club, thought that the [...] "hard sci-fi" [...] worked well as it was an area that The Original Series never went near. He thought that the story was {{different}} enough from [...] "The Devil in the Dark"—although the Horta was silicon based, {{it was at least}} easily recognisable as an alien creature. [...] "This makes it less exciting as a creature, but <b>more</b> <b>intriguing</b> as an idea," [...] Handlen argues. While he felt that the episode was a [...] "winner", he conceded that it was [...] "a bit on the dry side". James Hunt, whilst writing for the website Den of Geek, noted that the Enterprise fought a space-bound crystalline entity several episodes earlier in [...] "Datalore", which he considered [...] "a lot more impressive than these crystal microbrains...Okay, it wouldn't talk to them, but nor did it die the moment someone switched the frickin' lights off." [...] He felt that [...] "Home Soil" [...] was a generic Star Trek episode and thought that it was similar to The Original Series in tone.|$|E

500|$|Digital Spy's Lewis Corner {{reflected}} on the song's lyrics that [...] " [...] {{is still very much}} a sensitive soul despite a hardened public persona. [...] acknowledging her mortality, for some reason, feels wholly <b>more</b> <b>intriguing</b> than suggestive rhetoric that belongs with her work back in the '90s." [...] Jamieson Cox of Time and Lauren Murphy of The Irish Times agreed that the song is one of the album's highlights. Brennan Carley of Spin thought that the song [...] "revels convincingly in its vulnerability" [...] where as Lindsay Zoladz of New York cited [...] "Joan of Arc" [...] as one of the [...] "most affecting songs" [...] on the album for grappling with the feeling of being defeated and fatigued directly. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse was largely positive, declaring that the song [...] "is possibly Madonna’s best ballad since 'Miles Away'—or really since the Music or Ray of Light era." [...] On the other hand, Consequence of Sound's Sasha Geffen had mixed feelings about the song, calling it a [...] "lukewarm love [...] couples easy, inoffensive melodies with historical Christian imagery." [...] Further criticism came from Saeed Saeed of The National about the [...] "anaemic production", while The New Zealand Heralds Lydia Jenkin called it awfully pedestrian".|$|E
500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN was {{critical}} of both Shannon and her relationship with Boone before the plane crash, commenting [...] "Shannon's ability to 'sort-of' understand French and Boone's lifeguard training have had little impact and as characters they bring very little to the table. There are also too many <b>more</b> <b>intriguing</b> storylines and characters around them that deserve attention." [...] On their relationship he added, [...] "except for the final act, when they finally succumb to their lust for one another ... There's nothing exciting here or anything that will ultimately be built upon in the Lost universe." [...] In a later review, for the episode following Boone's death, he commented [...] " [...] were both left with {{very little to do}} this season. Especially Shannon, whose high point of usefulness was deciphering Rousseau's documents for Sayid. Well, Maggie Grace is given an opportunity to shine and she does an acceptable job as the distraught sibling who is now looking for someone to blame for Boone's death. We finally get to see some real depth to Shannon's character and her quest for vengeance is believable." [...] According to Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Shannon is [...] "the least deserving of sympathy of all the previously known survivors." ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviews {{singled out}} [...] "Nice Weather for Ducks" [...] as the album's {{stand-out}} track. Mason selected the [...] "dreamy, acoustic guitar-based" [...] song {{as one of}} the album's highlights in his review. Dahlen described it as [...] "the most likeable" [...] on the album, and concluded that it is [...] "a happy-slappy lollipop of a song that nicely sums this record up: Sunny, bright, and vaguely irritating." [...] Wysel wrote, [...] "When the flugelhorn arrives on 'Nice Weather for Ducks' it is impossible to believe there is any evil in the world." [...] Conversely, several critics felt that [...] "Experiment Number Six" [...] did not fit with the mood {{of the rest of the}} album. Wysel called it a [...] "pool of darkness" [...] that [...] "comes as quite a shock." [...] Dahlen felt that the song [...] "is the only break in the [...] mood." [...] While he enjoyed the song's concept, calling it [...] "so different and sinister that it's <b>more</b> <b>intriguing</b> than the rest of the album", he felt that it was [...] "annoyingly displaced." [...] Hermann, on the other hand, called the track [...] "clever" [...] and [...] "spooky" [...] with [...] "music ... so well crafted that [...] works".|$|E
