25|$|Port Royal {{is one of}} the area's more {{historic}} towns. It {{was first}} established in 1652 as a port on a navigable portion of the Rappahannock River during an era when waterways were the <b>major</b> <b>method</b> of transportation of people and property in the British Colony of Virginia. It was an important point for export of tobacco, Virginia's cash crop.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>major</b> <b>method</b> of cost {{reduction}} was to utilize secondary airports, which are generally less congested and charge less to lease space {{though they may}} be farther from the advertised destination. To save even more money at the airport, passengers boarded directly from the apron instead of using the jetway, saving both loading/unloading time as well as operating costs. Finally, ticket sales were entirely online. This not only saved on employee costs, but completely eliminated the need for a reservations call center.|$|E

25|$|The flies {{also cause}} a huge {{economic}} problem in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. In these areas sun-drying is the <b>major</b> <b>method</b> of preserving fish, as ice is typically unaffordable. However, blowfly larvae tend to infect these sun-dried fish {{when the weather}} is warm and humid. In an experiment, 95% of the infecting flies were found to be C. megacephala. The flies can be controlled by using an odor that the flies are attracted to trap them. Insecticides are also used, although this results in the development of resistance.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmission}} from swine {{to humans}} {{is believed to}} occur mainly in swine farms, where farmers are {{in close contact with}} live pigs. Although strains of swine influenza are usually not able to infect humans, this may occasionally happen, so farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to use face masks when dealing with infected animals. The use of vaccines on swine to prevent their infection is a <b>major</b> <b>method</b> of limiting swine-to-human transmission. Risk factors that may contribute to swine-to-human transmission include smoking and, especially, not wearing gloves when working with sick animals, thereby increasing the likelihood of subsequent hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose or hand-to-mouth transmission.|$|E
25|$|George {{was opposed}} to tariffs, which were at the time both the <b>major</b> <b>method</b> of {{protectionist}} trade policy and {{an important source of}} federal revenue (the federal income tax having not yet been introduced). He argued that tariffs kept prices high for consumers, while failing to produce any increase in overall wages. He also believed that tariffs protected monopolistic companies from competition, thus augmenting their power. Later in his life, free trade became a major issue in federal politics and his book Protection or Free Trade was read into the Congressional Record by five Democratic congressmen.|$|E

25|$|Seed {{capsules}} can be {{dried and}} used for decorations, but they also contain morphine, codeine, and other alkaloids. These pods can be boiled in water to produce a bitter tea that induces a long-lasting intoxication (See Poppy tea). If allowed to mature, poppy pods (poppy straw) can be crushed and used to produce lower quantities of morphinans. In poppies subjected to mutagenesis and selection on a mass scale, researchers {{have been able to}} use poppy straw to obtain large quantities of oripavine, a precursor to opioids and antagonists such as naltrexone. Although millennia older, the production of poppy head decoctions {{can be seen as a}} quick and dirty variant of the Kábáy poppy straw process, which since its publication in 1930 has become the <b>major</b> <b>method</b> of obtaining licit opium alkaloids worldwide, as discussed under the Wikipedia Morphine article.|$|E
25|$|Obligate {{parthenogenesis}} is {{the process}} in which organisms exclusively reproduce through asexual means. Many species {{have been shown to}} transition to obligate parthenogenesis over evolutionary time. Among these species, one of the most well documented transitions to obligate parthenogenesis was found in almost all metazoan taxa, albeit through highly diverse mechanisms. These transitions often occur as a result of inbreeding or mutation within large populations. There are a number of documented species, specifically salamanders and geckos, that rely on obligate parthenogenesis as their <b>major</b> <b>method</b> of reproduction. As such, there are over 80 species of unisex reptiles (mostly lizards but including a single snake species), amphibians and fishes in nature for which males are no longer a part of the reproductive process. A female will produce an ovum with a full set (two sets of genes) provided solely by the mother. Thus, a male is not needed to provide sperm to fertilize the egg. This form of asexual reproduction is thought in some cases to be a serious threat to biodiversity for the subsequent lack of gene variation and potentially decreased fitness of the offspring.|$|E
