40|$|Efficient {{investment}} in human capital {{is a subject}} of great concern among economists. By means of an overlapping-generations macrodynamic model with credit constraints, imperfect insurance and exogenous labor supply, we appraise inefficiencies related to mis{{investment in}} human capital and propose a simple scheme of redistributive taxation to mitigate them. A numerical simulation is calibrated in order to match stylized facts of Brazilian economy and shows that, in steady-state, with a flat-tax mechanism and lump-sum transfers, government intervention is beneficial to the extent it maximizes our utilitarian measure of welfare and reduces both inefficiency associated with <b>misdirected</b> <b>investment</b> in human capital and standard inequality indexes. After considering the possibility of decomposing our utilitarian measure of welfare and of allowing for public debt, we show that reduced inequality {{is the driving force}} which accounts for welfare improvement and that public debt plays no role. Robustness analysis shows that endogenizing labor supply does not lead to substantial changes in previous resultsinvestment in human capital; idiosyncratic risk; efficiency; overaccumulation of capital; redistributive taxation; public debt; welfare measures; social insurance...|$|E

40|$|The Productivity Commission’s {{inquiry report}} — Australia’s Urban Water Sector — was {{released}} in October 2011. In recent times, the urban water sector has faced drought, growing populations and ageing assets. Governments have largely responded with prolonged and severe water restrictions and investments in desalination capacity. The costs to consumers and the community have been large. Water restrictions {{are likely to have}} cost in excess of a billion dollars per year (nationally) from the lost value of consumption alone. Inefficient supply augmentation in Melbourne and Perth, for example, could cost consumers and communities up to $ 4. 2 billion over 20 years. Large government grants for infrastructure may have led to perverse outcomes. Conflicting objectives and unclear roles and responsibilities of governments, water utilities and regulators have led to inefficient allocation of water resources, <b>misdirected</b> <b>investment,</b> undue reliance on water restrictions and costly water conservation programs. Therefore, the largest gains are likely to come initially from establishing clear objectives, improving the performance of institutions with respect to roles and responsibilities, governance, regulation, competitive procurement of supply, and pricing, rather than trying to create a competitive market as in the electricity sector. To implement the recommended universal reforms, governments should: clarify that the overarching objective for policy in the sector is the efficient provision of water, wastewater and stormwater services so as to maximise net benefits to the community; ◦ensure that procurement, pricing and regulatory frameworks are aligned with the overarching objective and assigned to the appropriate organisation; put in place best practice arrangements for policy making, regulatory agencies, and water utilities; and put in place performance monitoring of utilities and monitor progress on reform. urban water; drinking water; waste water; water utilities; COAG; National Water Initiative; water reform framework; water security; water policy; water catchments; water resource planning; water supply services; water management practices...|$|E

In order to pay inheritance taxes, his estate was forced to sell its controlling interest in the company. Declining deposits in the Franklin area, the expense of pumping groundwater from mine shafts, and <b>misdirected</b> <b>investments</b> by the company led to the abandonment of the mines by the 1970s.

50|$|Administratively, {{incorrect}} or inconsistent {{data can}} lead to false conclusions and <b>misdirected</b> <b>investments</b> on {{both public and private}} scales. For instance, the government may want to analyze population census figures to decide which regions require further spending and investment on infrastructure and services. In this case, it will be important to have access to reliable data to avoid erroneous fiscal decisions. In the business world, incorrect data can be costly. Many companies use customer information databases that record data like contact information, addresses, and preferences. For instance, if the addresses are inconsistent, the company will suffer the cost of resending mail or even losing customers. The profession of forensic accounting and fraud investigating uses data cleansing in preparing its data and is typically done before data is sent to a data warehouse for further investigation. There are packages available so you can cleanse/wash address data while you enter it into your system. This is normally done via an application programming interface (API).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Samuel Fowler (1779-1844) settled in Franklin Furnace (now Franklin) {{to open up}} a medical practice, but is largely known for his {{interest}} in mineralogy which led to his developing commercial uses for zinc and for discovery of several rare minerals (chiefly various ores of zinc). Many of these zinc minerals are known for fluorescing in vivid colors when exposed to ultraviolet light. [...] Because of both the rich deposits and many of these minerals are not found anywhere else on earth, Franklin is known as the [...] "Fluorescent Mineral Capitol of the World." [...] Fowler, who later briefly served in elected political office, operated the local iron works and bought several abandoned zinc and iron mines in the area. Shortly after his death, two companies were created to exploit the iron and zinc deposits in this region; they acquired the rights to Fowler's holdings in Franklin and nearby Sterling Hill. These companies later merged to form the New Jersey Zinc Corporation (today known as Horsehead Industries). At this time, Russian, Chilean, British, Irish, Hungarian and Polish immigrants came to Franklin to work in the mines, and the population of Franklin swelled from 500 (in 1897) to over 3,000 (in 1913). Declining deposits in the Franklin area, the expense of pumping groundwater from mine shafts, tax disputes and <b>misdirected</b> <b>investments</b> by the company led to the abandonment of the mines. Today, both the Franklin and Sterling Hill mines are operated as museums.|$|R

Entertainment is a key industry whose fortunes are entwined with ICTs. Indeed, the application of ICT to innovating entertainment products is an important driver for the continued growth of the industry. Distribution of music and video via the Web could significantly stimulate demand but also raises the thorny question of how to protect intellectual property rights (IPR) of content providers. Another possible killer apps are interactive video-on-demand and telecalls/teleconferencing. The latter would, among other things, stimulate adoption of telework. The current Internet is capable of handing neither one-way transmissions of high-quality video nor interactive video-on-demand. There are bottlenecks both for the "last mile" connection from Internet service provider (ISP) to the home but also the "first miles" from originating server to ISP. The effective first miles bandwidth has not increased along with improvements in equipment, essentially because demand increases with capacity and thus traffic jams on the net continue. Digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies over telephone wires, and possibly wireless networks, will play important roles in getting over the last mile hurdle. Upgrading the first miles will probably require new networking protocols beyond TCP/IP that support multimedia and also changes in the economic model of information transfer via the Net...|$|E
40|$|Summary Reisen {{stresses}} that domestic causes of currency crises can be endogenous {{to the international}} financial system. Net capital transfers imply current account deficits on the recipient side. Sustained capital inflows produce a real appreciation which diverts investment away from export?oriented sectors. There were common structural weaknesses. Fixed exchange rates understated the investment risk. Liberalised, under?regulated financial sectors made <b>misdirected</b> international <b>investment</b> possible. The ratio of foreign denominated liabilities to reserves is the best vulnerability indicator, yet the crisis was unanticipated: information was deficient but not all available information had been used. For capital inflows to be sustainable they must be stable and must be invested efficiently in tradeable sectors. These conditions were not met in Southeast Asia...|$|R
40|$|Individual {{recognition}} in gregarious species is fundamental {{in order to}} avoid <b>misdirected</b> parental <b>investment.</b> In ungulates, two very different parental care strategies have been identified: ‘hider’ offspring usually lie concealed in vegetation whereas offspring of ‘follower’ species remain with their mothers while they forage. These two strategies have been suggested to impact on mother-offspring vocal recognition, with unidirectional recognition of the mother by offspring occurring in hiders and bidirectional {{recognition in}} followers. In domestic cattle, Bos taurus, a facultative hider species, vocal communication and recognition have not been studied in detail under free-ranging conditions, where cows and calves can graze freely and where hiding behaviour can occur. We hypothesized that, as a hider species, cattle under these circumstances would display unidirectional vocal recognition. To test this hypothesis, we conducted playback experiments using mother-offspring contact calls. We found that cows were more likely to respond, by moving their ears and/or looking, turning or walking towards the loudspeaker, to calls of their own calves than to calls from other calves. Similarly, calves responded more rapidly, and were more likely to move their ears and/or look, turn or walk towards the loudspeaker, and to call back and/or meet their mothers, in response to calls from their own mothers than to calls from other females. Contrary to our predictions, our results suggest that mother-offspring vocal individual recognition is bidirectional in cattle. Additionally, mothers of younger calves tended to respond more strongly to playbacks than mothers of older calves. Therefore, mother responses to calf vocalizations are at least partially influenced by calf age...|$|R
